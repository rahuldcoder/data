@entity0 , @entity1 -- a @entity5 graduate student has found the only known printed copy of @entity8 's @entity7 , tucked away in @entity10 's @entity9 , researchers said			1
@entity11 student @entity12 found the eight - page pamphlet , dated january 1 , 1804 , while researching @entity8 's early independence , @entity11 said in a statement thursday			1
the discovery sheds light on the early history of @entity8 and the relations it had with its @entity22 neighbors at the time , @entity12 and @entity11 professor @entity16 said			1
@entity12 is researching early 19th - century @entity8 for her doctoral dissertation in history , @entity24 said			1
she did research in @entity28 , @entity8 and @entity29 , where she saw a handwritten copy of the declaration in the papers of @entity29 's governor at the time , @entity34			2
it indicated there was a printed version somewhere , but it was n't enclosed			0
in late january , @entity12 went to @entity0 for research at the @entity9 , where she found the printed declaration			1
" i was n't specifically looking for it , but i had an eye out for it because i knew it was missing , " @entity12 said			0
" we figured there was an original somewhere , but did n't know if it still existed			0
" the declaration had not been misplaced and had been in the archives for a long time , @entity12 said			2
the period had simply not been studied in detail , and @entity12 said she figures people who saw the document before probably did n't realize what they had			2
@entity12 said she was thrilled by the discovery , but had to wait until the end of the day to notify her advisers at @entity11 , in @entity59			0
" the archives are not the place to make a big scene , " she said			0
@entity8 's declaration is only the second of its kind in the world , the first being the @entity7 , written by @entity63 and others , @entity24 said			1
the pamphlet , written in @entity70 , has three distinct parts , the @entity9 said			2
the first two pages are titled " liberte ou @entity81 , " which translates to " @entity82 , " in which the generals of the @entity8 army sign their names to an oath swearing to renounce forever the @entity70 yoke or die rather than live under its domination			1
next , @entity84 , the general - in - chief , addresses the citizens of @entity8 in an impassioned defense of independence and the destiny of the nation			2
on the final page , @entity8 army generals proclaim @entity84 governor - general for life and swear to obey without question laws issued under his authority			0
" to bring this document to light in @entity8 's darkest hour may be seen as a symbol of renewal and rejuvenation , helping @entity8 rebuild its national spirit following the recent earthquake , " said @entity97 , president of the @entity98			1
" @entity12 's achievement in recognizing the significance of this printed document deserves high recognition			2
" @entity111 , the acting chief executive of the @entity9 , said they were pleased to play a role in the discovery			0
" it 's incredible that the long search for this important document should finally end at the @entity9 , " @entity111 said			2
" this declaration sent to the @entity10 government by @entity8 's first independent leader is of great historical importance to both @entity8 and the @entity10 people , and provides unique insight into the first successful slave rebellion of modern times			1
" @entity126 , a professor of @entity70 studies at @entity11 who has researched the @entity129 publication of @entity8 's independence documents , said the discovery also shows @entity8 had a fully functional printing apparatus at every moment of the new nation 's independence			1
researchers had looked for the printed declaration before , without success , said @entity139 , a @entity11 professor of @entity70 studies and history and one of @entity12 's advisers			2
in 1952 , @entity8 asked intellectual @entity143 to find an original or printed copy so it could be displayed for the nation 's 150th anniversary , @entity139 said			0
@entity143 searched in many archives in @entity8 and elsewhere before writing with exasperation that all his searching had been " in vain , " @entity139 said			0
" it is really beyond belief , " @entity143 said at the time , " that not even a copy of the original printed version has been found in @entity28 , or in @entity1 , or in the @entity129			0
" @entity12 's discovery , @entity139 said , " has finally changed that			0
" documents from @entity8 's early history have not been well preserved and are scattered in various places , said @entity139 , who is working with other historians to rehabilitate @entity8 's archives after the january 12 earthquake			1
@entity139 and @entity12 consulted @entity163 , a noted @entity8 archivist at @entity164 , to confirm the document 's authenticity			1
" i was so happy to find out it was true , " @entity163 said			0
" it is an important document , and its discovery is important news for @entity8 's scholarly community and more broadly for the people of @entity8			1
" @entity12 said she hopes the discovery will remind historians , @entity8 and the world about the early history of the only country in the @entity180 where slaves successfully revolted to gain national independence			1
" the @entity183 was of immense consequence to @entity29 and other colonies in the @entity22 , as well as to the @entity129 , " @entity12 said			0
" this find is further evidence that there was contact and negotiations going on between them			0
@entity8 was not isolated after independence and it played a complicated role in a world based on colonialism and slavery			0
