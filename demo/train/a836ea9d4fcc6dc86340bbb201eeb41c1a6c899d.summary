the occasional satellite dish , motorized houseboat or construction of a new guesthouse are the only nods to increased outside interest in this seemingly endless string of interconnected waterways , paddy fields and coconut groves that stretches down the @entity16			0

the main rivers are like a watery highway , so the journey wo n't always be peaceful			2
the days of being only the houseboat on the water are long gone and cruisers can expect municipal passenger boats to motor past			0
