@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 this week announced the biggest viral video sensations of 2009 , with @entity6 singer @entity5 topping the list			1
the most pressing question for aspiring video creators : how do you repeat that kind of success ? value in views topping the @entity3 charts brings significant value -- @entity5 's clip had more than 120 million views on the site			1
had the parties involved negotiated an ad revenue split ( they initially did not ) , a not - inconceivable $ 10 cost - per - thousand - impressions would have yielded revenue in excess of $ 1 million			0
when a clip has a commercial purpose , the brand value may be significantly higher : @entity30 's @entity29 ad ranked fifth , with more than 27 million views , and the company says the campaign 's success slowed its sales decline			1
a commercial impact was also felt in the case of the @entity38 ( more than 33 million views )			0
the clip , which features a wedding party dancing down the aisle to @entity44 's " forever , " sent the track rocketing up the @entity47 charts			1
what are the commonalities here , and is there a formula for viral video success ? a definitive answer is infuriatingly absent			1
the cute factor the cute factor is perhaps the most prevalent trend among popular @entity3 videos			1
in @entity3 's most - viewed videos of all time , you 'll find such adorable clips as a boy biting his brother 's finger ( 140 million views ) , a baby laughing hysterically ( 100 million views ) , a sneezing panda ( 46 million views ) and even the @entity30 ad			2
the explanation is simple : when a clip makes us happy , we feel compelled to share that sentiment with others			1
humor if our willingness to share is based on our emotional reaction to a clip , it follows that humor ranks highly on @entity3			1
from @entity84 's ventriloquist act " @entity82 " to the obscure humor of " @entity86 , " laughter is a common theme			0
in some cases , humor is not the intent : @entity90 's @entity89 has surpassed 45 million views , our amusement ( and discomfort ) deriving from @entity95 's utterly bizarre performance			2
comedy has geographical limitations however : what 's funny in one country may be unfathomable in another			0
this perhaps explains why laughing babies consistently outrank standup comedians : funny does n't travel			0
emotional response not every popular clip evokes laughter -- performances from @entity5 and @entity108 tug at the heartstrings			0
so too does the @entity110 -- a music video featuring an @entity113 man giving out " @entity110 " to strangers in public places has received more than 53 million views			0
music music videos are by far the most viewed content on @entity3			2
had @entity3 not created a second list to highlight top music videos on the site , these would have dominated the rankings for 2009			0
the knowledge that best - selling artists rank highly on video sites may be of little utility to aspiring @entity3 stars -- except to note that dancing videos and " lip dubs " have proved popular			2
with 132 million views , @entity133 's evolution of dance is a breakout success			0
cumulative advantage is the quality of the clip the only factor affecting its success ? or could it be that the rich get richer , even in the seemingly egalitarian world of @entity3 ? since most @entity3 users head straight to the site 's " @entity150 " page , clips that show early promise may continue to gain momentum for weeks and years			1
this process of cumulative advantage may help to explain why one laughing baby shoots to the top of the charts and another giggles in obscurity			0
no formula ? it may be the case that there 's no simple formula for @entity3 popularity			2
in fact , it may be that the only true guarantee of success is novelty			2
the unexpected , the bizarre , the humorous , the offbeat , the emotionally affecting -- these authentic elements are hard to bottle , and fakes are easy to spot			0
what will be @entity3 's breakout video of 2010 ? we 'll know it when we see it .			1

@entity175 's @entity174 ponders what makes a @entity3 video a viral smash
topping the @entity3 charts brings significant value to *advertisers* and video *producers*
why " cute " works : when a clip makes us happy , we want to share that feeling with others
the only guarantee of success may be novelty : the unexpected , the bizarre
