the smell of burnt plastic leaps out at you			2
acrid in the throat , omnipresent , extinguishing from the air all the other smells of city life -- because really there is none			1
the scenes of destruction -- the fact every street is pockmarked by two years of shelling -- you have seen in activist videos online			1
but the smell is something striking : it notifies you that you are on the edge of humanity			2
@entity20 is a dusty , pale skeleton of the city i reported from 22 months ago			1
since then , it has seen too much			2
it has seen the world lose much of its horror at its plight and instead focus on the extremists in rebel ranks who @entity32 officials fear may eventually turn their ire on @entity34			2
it has seen the regime of @entity38 president @entity37 seem to edge towards collapse and then pull back from the brink with @entity42 and @entity43 support , in the face of a divided opposition and international community			2
but most visibly of all , @entity20 has had the life bombed out of it			1
you can not open your eyes without seeing the impact of @entity38 's internecine rush to oblivion			1
it is in keeping with the contempt @entity37 's regime has for those who disagree with him , that the largest city has born the brunt of his crudest and most indiscriminate weapon			1
the " barrel bomb " is itself a symptom of a war so long and exhaustive , the ways of state - backed killing have by necessity become homemade and improvised , rather than precise and militarized			1
it is a simple device : take a barrel and fill it with explosive and any shrapnel you can find			2
then fly over @entity20 , normally in helicopters , and drop the barrel when you see a populated area			1
this has since been refined , activists say			2
the bombers now drop one device and then wait 10 to 30 minutes			2
the aim is to ensure that those who flooded in to the scene to rescue the victims are then killed , the activists say			2
" you will see that when the first one lands , everyone stays in cover for 30 minutes , " one activist told me			2
" they know now a second bomb is coming			1
" @entity96 has borne the brunt of much of the bombing in the past weeks for a simple reason : that is where the people have moved to			2
other areas were bombed previously , and those people moved to @entity96 and elsewhere , so now it is bombed			2
when we arrive , the locals are sifting through the remnants of last night 's blast			1
it came at 1 a.m. -- two bombs , 10 minutes apart , killing between 6 and 7 people and injuring dozens , one man tells us			1
the familiarity with death means the precise number of victims is n't something people around here seek out			0
the bodies have been gathered , until dawn , and now locals are scavenging			0
this is the scene of a mass murder , but there is such a paucity of life here that blankets , pillows and other small household items are salvaged and ferried away			1
it is n't clear if those taking them away once owned them			0
the mosque nearby has been hit too , and the front again torn off another house			1
men walking on the slender remainders of floors gather items from what remains of each room			0
the barrel bombing -- with all its random callousness -- is a tactic with a goal , it appears			0
the regime is moving to clear the remaining parts of @entity20 of rebels and their supporters , of all human life it seems , because human life here is opposed to them by ideology or just association			1
barrel bombs are an effective way of doing that			0
at the same time , the regime is beginning to close a loop on the ring roads around to the north of @entity20 that would -- with the exception of one key road , still free to rebel traffic -- encircle the city entirely			1
those who live there fear they will follow the same fate as the city of @entity174 , besieged and shelled for months and starved into submission only recently			1
the international aid community , worried by how real that prospect is , has been meeting urgently to prepare for that eventuality : refugees and the demand for food for the besieged			0
but for now , while they wait to be encircled , the killing continues			0
in one of the hospitals -- dark , secretive buildings , that fear attack by the regime , where antiseptic reeks from recently mopped floors -- we meet a @entity193 citizen			0
@entity38 in origin , born in @entity195 , he has lived in @entity196 long enough to keep his accent , but he prefers not to be named			0
six weeks ago , he was hit in a bomb blast , which tore the skin from his left leg			1
he is wincing in indescribable pain as he explains what it 's like to be hit by a bomb			1
" first there is a plane in the sky			0
we duck down , and they just hit us with a bomb , " he said			1
" i did n't feel anything			0
the next thing i was woken up and i could not feel my leg			0
things were burning around me			0
they took me to a hospital and i woke up i realized i was burning			1
they did their best , but they could not do much			0
i was moving from hospital to another and the next thing i realized i had lost all the skin on my whole leg			1
i ca n't sleep at night , it 's unbearable			1
" throughout our conversation his leg , bandaged to prevent an infection that could kill him , but hidden by the green of his surgeon 's tunic , bounces up and down , purely out of fear , agony or nerves			1
" we are in hell , just go outside , the city is flattened , " he said			1
it 's every single day			1
every single day , every single hour			0
there 's no people any more			1
no cats , no insects			0
" it is baffling how life is sustained in @entity20			1
there are palpable changes in the past two years to what was once @entity38 's commercial , bustling , metropolitan hub			1
women are now more frequently covered from head to toe in the hijab and many wear the niqab across their face			0
our producer had an inch of her exposed hair tucked back into her scarf while she was talking to some women in a hospital -- the helpful female bystander was just trying to help a sister out			1
in one hospital , we met a young girl who had been hit by a sniper , but who refused to speak on camera because she and her mother - in - law knew her husband -- apparently a fighter -- would kill her for doing so			1
this is not a war that has an adjusted , moderate society waiting to spring to life in the first throes of peace			1
basic utilities are more and more scarce			0
a full drought hit recently when rebels cut off their own water when they tried to disrupt the regime 's supplies			1
now water rarely comes from the faucet			0
we see one woman who fills her plastic jugs from a hose in the street			0
some shops appear open ; we purchased a usb with remarkable speed			0
but most streets echo with the pain and fear of those who have left			0
markets and bakeries resonate with unease at the regime 's tactic of hitting anything that seems crowded			2
the last time i was here , you could see life in all its messy forms , occasionally interrupted and shattered by the bombing			2
then it seemed to aim at something , clumsy and off - target as it was			0
now that is clearly not the case			0
the randomness seems to give some people solace , in that there is just nothing they can do			0
two children we spoke to briefly on a hospital bench said they were used to it ; it is part of life , like school or a favorite t - shirt would normally be in childhood			1
the youngest are targets , and we met several very young children , some as young as 3 , who were quiet , subdued , as though caught in that moment of tense , looming pressure when a storm moves in to break over your head			1
22 months ago , we reported on the fate of @entity343 , a 4 - year - old girl hit by a sniper who fired through the frosted glass of her apartment window , into the room she was sitting in , the bullet hitting her jaw and eventually lodging in her throat , killing her			1
it is unlikely the sniper who took her life knew who his target was			2
the shot was fired purely to terrify			0
this time we meet @entity358			0
he is 5 and in a hospital			2
he too was hit by a sniper			2
he too was at home when the bullet struck			0
he was watching cartoons , his mother tells me			0
the bullet hit his stomach , exploding inside him , and causing exit wounds in his front and sides			2
the doctor pinches his chest skin roughly to check he is conscious			0
he is and raises an outstretched hand towards me and the doctor			0
his eyes are closed , a tear caught in the corner			0
" what is wrong with his eyes , " she cries , referring to the sniper			0
" could he not see this is my child ? why did he shoot him ? " on the outskirts of rebel areas , there is an enormous pile of trash burning constantly , infecting the air			0
one activist told me the plastic is burned to power oil refineries , to make money for the various rebel groups			0
in fighting for life , they make life unlivable			2
smoke rises endlessly above @entity20 , leaving behind those who can not leave , who must find life in its embers			1
