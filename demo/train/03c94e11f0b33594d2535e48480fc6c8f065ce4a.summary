@entity0 -- @entity2 may not have known where she would end up , but she has always known that with hard work , anything is possible			1
@entity6 , a @entity7 staffer , says anything is possible in @entity8			0
@entity2 , 30 , works as a @entity7 staffer on what the @entity11 administration sees as the most pressing issue of the day : health care reform			1
she meets with president @entity11 several times a week and expresses the same kind of determination and sense of hard work to her job			1
" you have to continue to plow forward and just keep working until it gets done , " she explained			0
" i stay focused on the job at hand and i 'm committed to getting this done			0
" @entity2 did n't always want to work at @entity7			1
as a student at @entity26 , a historically black college , she developed a passion for international affairs and originally wanted to follow the path set by another @entity31 - @entity8 woman			1
" watching [ former secretary of state ] @entity32 at the prime point of her career , [ i began ] thinking , ' i can do this			2
' " so @entity2 moved to @entity36 and started working for @entity37			2
but then she got a call from someone asking if she might be interest in interning for " this new guy , @entity11			2
" watching the news from abroad , she did n't know much about @entity11 , a senator at the time , except that he was the guy " with @entity46 roots , " as she put it			1
so she decided to put her dreams of international field work on hold and give @entity50 a try			0
" i thought , ' well , i 've never done anything on @entity50 , i 've never worked over on @entity50			0
' " @entity2 recalled , " so this would be a great opportunity and let me just go see what this is about and learn as much as i can while i 'm there , " what was supposed to be a six - month internship with @entity11 's @entity61 office became a full - time position after only three months , and she followed that trail all the way to @entity7			1
although @entity2 's journey to the @entity7 was never " inconceivable " to her , she still takes time to appreciate how far she has come			1
" i do n't want to lose sight of what it took to get here , what it means to be here and what an extraordinary honor it is to be working for president @entity11 , " @entity2 said			1
" i have those moments every day and i really do try to remind myself every single day why i 'm here and what an extraordinary privilege it is			0
" she also tries to go back to her alma mater to speak to students , particularly african - americans who might not think they , too , can work at the @entity7 someday			0
" it gives me the opportunity to go back and speak about my path because it can inspire them , " @entity2 explains			2
" it 's changing a perspective for them in light of what it is they can achieve			0
" " @entity91 is accessible to anybody , " @entity2 said			0
" your options and the possibilities in life are really limitless			0

@entity2 , 30 , is a *graduate* of @entity26 in @entity0
@entity2 says she was inspired by former secretary of state @entity99
she originally worked for @entity11 's @entity61 office and later on his campaign
@entity2 : " i do n't want to lose sight of what it took to get here "
