-- attorneys general in 17 states have banded together to call on @entity3 , the online classified ad website , to discontinue its adult services section			1
" the increasingly sharp public criticism of @entity3 's @entity11 section reflects a growing recognition that ads for prostitution -- including ads trafficking children -- are rampant on it , " the attorneys general said in a tuesday letter to @entity3 ceo @entity7 and founder @entity8			1
the letter continued : " we recognize that @entity3 may lose the considerable revenue generated by the @entity11 ads. no amount of money , however , can justify the scourge of illegal prostitution , and the suffering of the women and children who will continue to be victimized , in the market and trafficking provided by @entity3			0
" a @entity3 spokeswoman said wednesday that the site agreed with at least some of the letter			2
" we strongly support the attorneys general desire to end trafficking in children and women , through the @entity37 or by any other means , " @entity31 , who handles media inquiries for @entity3 , told @entity0 wednesday			1
" we hope to work closely with them , as we are with experts at nonprofits and in law enforcement , to prevent misuse of our site in facilitation of trafficking , and to combat such crimes wherever they appear , online or offline			1
" in their letter , the attorneys general highlighted an open letter , which appeared as a @entity53 ad , in which two girls said they were sold for sex on @entity3			1
when the ad came out , @entity7 wrote a blog post in response that said , " @entity3 is anxious to know that the perpetrators in these girls ' cases are behind bars			0
" the letter also highlighted a report in may by @entity0 's @entity65 , who posted a fake ad in the adult section			1
she received 15 calls soliciting sex in three hours			1
earlier this month , @entity70 interviewed a woman named " @entity72 " who sells sex on @entity3			0
she told @entity70 a @entity3 ad was " the fastest , quickest way you 're for sure going to see somebody that day			0
" in a later blog , @entity7 said @entity3 implemented manual screening of adult services ads in may 2009			1
" since that time , before being posted each individual ad is reviewed by an attorney			0
" he said the attorneys are trained to enforce @entity3 's posting guidelines , " which are stricter than those typically used by yellow pages , newspapers , or any other company that we are aware of			2
" attorneys general from @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 , @entity97 , @entity98 , @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity101 , @entity102 , @entity103 , @entity104 , @entity105 , @entity106 and @entity107 made the request a week after accused " @entity109 " @entity109 committed suicide in jail			2
@entity109 was charged with the april 2009 killing of @entity113			0
@entity114 said that @entity113 , a model , advertised as a masseuse on @entity3 , and @entity109 might have met her through the website			0
in 2008 , under pressure from state prosecutors , the website raised the fees for posting adult services ads. in 2009 , it started donating portions of the money generated by adult ads to charity			2
a @entity0 investigation of @entity3 's " adult services " section , which replaced " erotic services ads " two years ago , counted more than 7,000 ads in a single day			1
many offered thinly veiled " services " for anything from $ 50 for a half hour to $ 400 an hour			0
@entity8 has defended his site , saying it is doing more than any other site that hosts adult ads to help filter out underage prostitutes and report them to police			0
best , the @entity3 spokeswoman , said that fewer than one ad in 10,000 meets the @entity146 's guidelines for anti-trafficking action			0
" only @entity3 has the power to stop these ads before they are even published , and sadly they are completely unwilling to do so , " @entity96 attorney general @entity148 said in a statement .			2
