@entity0 -- this year 's first day of reckoning for president @entity4 's signature domestic initiative is fast approaching			0
the second is seven - plus months away			0
the big question : will the math on the first have anything to do with the math on the second ? march 31 is the first benchmark : the first big enrollment deadline for what @entity13 prefer to call the @entity15			1
the second is @entity17 in november			0
the administration is all but certain to fall short of its stated enrollment goal of 7 million			0
but after a disastrous initial rollout , crossing the 6 million mark by the march 31 deadline appears within reach , and the @entity24 will make the case that it is a policy success that leaves the program on a firm footing			1
but whether the improving numbers can be used to reshape the political climate as it relates to the health care law depends on whether @entity13 on the ballot this year in competitive races have the courage to more forcefully rebut the @entity35 argument that the health care law is a disaster			1
justices to hear ' @entity40 ' case on @entity15 birth control rule @entity42 sees a shifting tide			2
" i believe that it 's a winner , " the @entity24 minority leader said thursday			0
but she then added the critical part : " that is a case we have to make			0
" some of @entity42 's point is personal : she was @entity24 speaker when the health care law passed , and it is a proud piece of her legislative legacy			1
some of her appeal , though , is raw politics : she believes that @entity13 who run from the health care law only help republicans who are making it their focus in the midterm campaign			1
she is at the moment a lonely voice in making the case that @entity13 should celebrate the law , not distance themselves from it			2
and the latest polling underscores her challenge in persuading democrats in tough races -- especially statewide @entity67 contests -- to be more open , and aggressive , in promoting the law			0
a @entity69 survey released thursday found that 53 % of @entity70 disapprove of the 2010 health care law ; 41 % approve			1
here 's a nugget in that survey that @entity42 could use to make her case : a majority of those who oppose the @entity15 think politicians should enact fixes to make it work better			2
but most of the data suggest the issue will remain a potent one for the @entity35			0
though 72 % of @entity13 support the law , only 37 % of independents and 8 % of @entity35 do			2
and the potency of the health care issue for the @entity35 comes into stark focus when you dig deeper into the demographic splits in the @entity69 data			2
@entity4 : @entity13 get ' clobbered ' in midterms in a midterm year , turnout among african - americans and @entity93 tends to drop significantly , something @entity4 lamented yet again thursday night at a @entity13 fundraising dinner			1
" in midterms , we get clobbered , " the president said , " either because we do n't think it 's important or we 've become so discouraged about what 's happening in @entity0 that we think it 's not worth our while			0
" history suggests the midterm electorate will be older and whiter than in a presidential year , something that would tilt the scales -- on health care and other issues -- in the @entity35 direction			1
consider this from the @entity69 health care survey : seventy - seven percent of blacks support the law , as do 47 % of @entity115			1
but just 33 % of whites support the law			0
and just 35 % of those over the age of 65 support the law ; 56 % oppose it			0
in presidential years , when more younger voters and people of color turn out , the demographics favor @entity13			2
but this year , the @entity35 appears likely to have a demographic advantage and one magnified by the fact that those most likely to vote in november are least likely to support the president 's health care law .			1

march 31 is big deadline for @entity15 enrollment , but november elections are true test
to win , @entity13 will have to change narrative that @entity15 is a *failure*
support for the health care law is divided along partisan and racial lines
@entity13 midterm turnout among minorities , young voters tends to drop
