-- the trainer at the center of a major horse doping scandal has been charged with multiple breaches of the rules by the @entity6			1
employed by the ruler of @entity10 's prestigious @entity9 operation -- sheikh @entity11 -- trainer @entity12 has been summoned to attend a disciplinary hearing in central @entity14 on thursday			1
testers from the @entity6 found anabolic steroids -- ethylestranol and stanozolol -- in 11 samples taken from 45 horses from @entity9 's @entity21 stable in eastern @entity23			1
@entity11 said he was " locking down " the stables with immediate effect and ordering an internal review			0
anabolic steroids work on horses as they do on humans -- helping to build strength and muscle			1
@entity12 , who has admitted using the banned substances in error , faces charges relating to the use of prohibited substances , keeping medication records and conduct " prejudicial to horse racing "			1
in addition to the 11 horses that tested positive on april 9 , @entity12 in co-operating with the investigating officers also admitted that he had given steroids to four more horses			1
that quartet were not subjected to testing			0
" as these additional horses were not tested and no positive samples exist , no charges are brought in relation to them ( prohibited substances ) and as such the trainer remains facing the original 11 counts of this charge at this stage , " said the @entity6			1
" however , it is appropriate to charge the trainer with breaches of the rules related to medication records and conduct prejudicial to horse racing related to these horses , and therefore the trainer now faces 15 counts of these charges			1
earlier this week @entity12 said , in a statement by @entity9 , that he had a made a " catastrophic error			1
" he added : " i deeply regret what has happened because the horses involved were not racing at the time , i did not realize that what i was doing was in breach of the rules of racing			2
" i can only apologize for the damage this will cause to @entity9 and to racing generally			2
" @entity9 is one of the world 's most successful stables , with more than 2,000 race wins since it was formed in 1992			0
it has been named champion @entity82 owner eight times , including last year , while @entity10 ruler @entity11 and his family have also taken the title on multiple occasions going back to the 1980s			0
meanwhile @entity11 pledged to " lock down " @entity90 's @entity89 stables and test every horse at its @entity21 operation			0
" i was appalled and angered to learn that one of our stables in @entity21 has violated @entity9 's ethical standards and the rules of @entity82 racing , " he said			1
stable lockdown " i have been involved in @entity82 horse racing for 30 years and have deep respect for its traditions and rules			1
there can be no excuse for any deliberate violation			0
" @entity9 is fully cooperating with the @entity6 to get to the bottom of this matter and take any appropriate disciplinary action			2
" i have ordered the @entity9 management to undertake an immediate review of our internal procedures and controls to ensure to prevent any reoccurrence of this type of activity in any stables of mine			0
" we will be locking down the @entity89 stables with immediate effect , and i have instructed that i want a full round of blood samples , and dope testing done on every single horse on that premises			0
" i can assure the racing public that no horse will run from that yard this season until i have been absolutely assured by my team that the entire yard is completely clean			0
" @entity12 joined @entity9 in march 2010 and won the @entity133 , one of @entity82 's five classics , in his first season			2
but the sanctions now facing the 37 - year - old at the disciplinary hearing include substantial fines , the withdrawal of his training licence or a suspension from the sport			2
@entity145 was still legal as recently as 2008 , when @entity146 won the @entity147 and the @entity148 in the @entity149 after having regular injections			0
his trainer 's admission , and the subsequent outcry , led to the drug being widely banned			0
the @entity6 said there has only been one other case of anabolic steroids being found in a tested horse in recent years , which was when @entity82 trainer @entity159 allowed horses to run under the substances in 2008 and 2009			1
the use of anabolic steroids is now prohibited at all times for any horse registered as " in training " under the care of a trainer licensed by the @entity6			1
however , it is still legal for out - of - competition use in @entity171 , such as helping to overcome injuries			0
the @entity6 carries out testing during race meetings and while horses are in training			2
in 2012 , the organization tested 7,182 samples from a total of 90,174 runners -- 14 of which returned positive results			0
the @entity6 conducted between 600 - 700 tests in 2012 while horses were in training .			0

@entity9 trainer @entity12 charged with multiple breaches of horse racing rules
he will face a @entity6 hearing in @entity14 on thursday
*evidence* from @entity12 revealed 15 horses were given anabolic steroids
@entity12 could be sanctioned with hefty fines and a possible ban from the sport
