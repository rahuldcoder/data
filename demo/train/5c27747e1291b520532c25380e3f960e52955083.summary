like this week , when @entity2 , @entity2 and @entity2 escaped their captor after being missing for a decade			2
it turned out they were locked away and alive the entire time			2
their fortuitous escape is like a ray of light and reminds us that sometimes good things do happen			2
a cry for help came out from the walls of silence , and a member of the community responded , aiding in the rescue			0
the selfless act of a total stranger only reinforces that the public will help when needed			0
but their story is unusual			0
many missing persons who have been missing for a long time are still not found			1
we should urge all communities to play an integral part in assisting law enforcement in investigations about missing persons			1
we live in a world filled with powerful technology that has enabled us to communicate faster and better , yet we seem to lack the simple face - to - face meeting that must take place when searching for clues and information in any type of investigation			0
at - a - glance : still missing in the @entity40 the old " knock and tell " method remains an effective tool today			1
it must be used when searching for our missing persons			1
when you talk to someone in person , you can read them better by registering their expressions , gestures and other factors			0
sometimes , those things could yield clues			0
this door - to - door technique can make the difference in finding someone in hours , days or years			1
there 's no doubt that trying to find missing persons requires a tremendous amount of work			1
classifying cases as " runaways " or " walk - aways " does nothing to help the outcome of any given case			0
if anything , it could hinder and slow the process			0
the general public normally will not have a heightened sense of concern for those believed to have left on their own			0
the sense of urgency and hitting the ground running from the start could be the difference in many missing person cases			1
a case can be misdiagnosed upon closing ; this is when we confirm that the labeling provided a wrong direction			0
the word " missing " should be enough and important ; the alert ( s ) system in place such as the @entity92 / silver provide an additional emergency notification seeking the public 's help			1
the myth of " a waiting period " to report a missing person still lingers , and many families are turned away by officials and forced to begin their journey on their own without any direction or support			2
due to heavy caseloads , law enforcement officials are frequently not afforded the continuous training and education that could help them in the search for a missing person			1
abused but alive : lessons from survivors all too often , information is not provided to victims suffering a missing loved one in the onset , such as where to file the report and what agencies can provide support services and help with advocacy and on - the - ground services			2
these are all key issues that need to be addressed as we move forward to bring home those missing in our country			2
cold cases and unidentified persons need to be revisited and reopened			2
all cold cases need to be updated and looked at again with a keen eye on what can be done to aid in a recovery			0
as we rejoice in the happy ending for the three women and their families and friends , we need to be reminded that there is still much work to be done in the world of the missing			1
we need to remember that there are thousands of people who are still seeking resolution and waiting for answers concerning their loved one			0
as a community , we need to come together , take notice and become aware of what happens in our homes , neighborhoods , towns and cities			0
and we need to always remember that " every missing person is somebody 's child			1
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity158 .			1
