the involvement of five @entity2 countries in the air strikes against @entity4 in @entity5 is a major new development for the region			1
it is not yet clear exactly what role they have played in what the @entity11 described as " participation and support " for the operation , but this is about symbolism more than military might			2
for the @entity20 , it was vitally important to avoid this looking like another @entity23 attack on a @entity25 country , and to emphasize that opposition to @entity4 comes from within the @entity2 and @entity28 worlds - where the vast majority of their victims have come from			1
but what 's in it for the @entity2 countries ? the move reflects a combination of concerns about their domestic security and their international reputation			1
longer term , beyond the concerns about @entity4 itself , it reflects a desire on the part of these @entity2 states to play a more active role in regional security -- but also illustrates the risks that can affect anyone wanting to become the policeman of the region			1
firstly , these states see @entity4 as a threat to their own domestic security			1
@entity4 's ideology does n't only condemn the " infidel @entity63 ; " like @entity57 , it is also dead set against the existing regimes in the @entity2 states , and wants the states themselves to fall and be replaced by a caliphate			1
@entity64 , which has confirmed its air force was involved in tuesday 's strikes , has been the victim of @entity57 ( @entity69 ) attacks before , in 2003 - 04 , and @entity70 was bombed by an @entity69 affiliate led by @entity72 , an ideological precursor of @entity4			1
for its part , the @entity74 has accused the @entity76 of plotting to overthrow it			0
the @entity74 is the most hawkish of the five states when it comes to @entity28 , and @entity20 officials say that @entity74 forces recently bombed @entity83 militants in @entity84 , a claim dismissed by a @entity74 minister			1
if so , this would be another indication of the growing military assertiveness of this small but wealthy country			0
however , if it happened it proved ineffective ; the militants subsequently took @entity93 airport			0
second , for some @entity95 , especially @entity96 , there is a worry that some in the @entity63 actually blame them for @entity4 emerging			1
several @entity101 countries have been arming and funding a variety of @entity5 opposition groups -- as the @entity63 has too			1
gulf states say they 've funded only " moderate rebels " , and that though this has included some @entity28 , they are not @entity4			1
but there are allegations of @entity96 funding for @entity110 , an @entity57 affiliate , which @entity96 denies			0
@entity96 is also being criticized harshly by @entity111 for supporting @entity112			0
for @entity96 , therefore , a role in the airstrikes operation is a chance to counter the allegations that it supports terrorism			0
it is also a chance to make a rare display of solidarity between @entity96 and @entity74 , who have been at odds because they take opposing approaches to @entity28 in the region			0
both the @entity96 and @entity74 air forces participated in enforcing the no fly zone in @entity84			0
but since then they 've backed different sides in @entity84			0
indeed the @entity84 pm has alleged that @entity96 planes tried to take weapons to the militants holding @entity93 airport			0
this evident disunity has weakened the foreign policy credibility of the @entity101 cooperation council , the regional alliance of @entity101 monarchies , so it has been especially important for the key @entity101 players to pull together against @entity4			2
the @entity64 interior ministry has always been concerned that funding @entity28 could lead to blowback			0
they 've seen this before , with @entity146			0
however , it 's less clear exactly what covert intelligence operations may have been supported in their bid to topple @entity151 and combat @entity152 ; and when weapons and money go into a complex and fragmented civil war , it is not always certain where they will end up			1
there has certainly been private funding from the @entity101 ; the @entity160 has recently blacklisted several private individuals from the @entity101 for funding @entity4 and @entity162 several thousand @entity64 have gone to fight in @entity5 -- though with a range of opposition groups , some of which are supported by the @entity63			1
and there have been claims in the @entity23 media that the @entity64 interpretation of @entity28 itself promotes this kind of exclusionary ideology -- which @entity64 reject strongly , saying their religion is against the shedding of innocent blood			0
for @entity178 , this is a reminder of the period after 9/11 , when @entity20 analysts seriously questioned the value of their alliance with @entity64			2
indeed , as part of its response to @entity4 , @entity64 convened a regional counterterrorism summit on this year 's anniversary of 9/11			2
but for the @entity187 to take part in a @entity20 - led coalition is something much more dramatic , not seen since 1991 , when @entity101 forces joined @entity20 - led coalition to liberate @entity193 from @entity195 occupation			2
@entity64 forces have been involved in fighting @entity198 militants in @entity199 in recent years , in a war almost entirely ignored by @entity23 media			0
but both these conflicts were on their own borders , and had a defensive aspect			0
greater military assertiveness by the @entity101 countries , and @entity101 cooperation with the larger armies in @entity209 and @entity70 , are key regional trends to watch			0
gulf countries will remain keen to expand their own limited military capabilities and be less reliant on the @entity20 , just in case it is not always there to guard them			2
some in the @entity101 , including the former emir of @entity96 , have expressed frustration that the @entity20 was not doing enough to end the @entity5 conflict and suggesting that there should be an @entity2 intervention			1
however , until recently , they were talking about an @entity2 intervention against @entity151			1
with this latest display of military force , the @entity5 who sympathize with the opposition will be asking why these countries did n't have the same interest in defending them against regime attacks and chemical weapons .			2

five @entity2 states participated in or support airstrikes against @entity4 targets in @entity5 , the @entity20 says
@entity236 says their support reflects concerns about security and reputation
some of the @entity95 are concerned that the @entity63 blames them for @entity4 's rise , she says
but *pro-opposition* @entity5 will ask why they did n't intervene against @entity151 , she says
