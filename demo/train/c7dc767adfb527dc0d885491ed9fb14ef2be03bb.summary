a substance described as " white stuff " and " milky rain " is covering parts of @entity5 and @entity7 states , but its origin is a mystery			2
" we have received reports of ' white stuff ' on vehicles			0
the ash is more than likely from the @entity18 , " @entity5 's @entity15 officials said in statement			2
the volcano , located on the @entity23 in extreme northeast @entity24 , " spewed an ash plume to about the 20,000 - foot level in late january , " the agency says			1
" it has been deposited in a widespread area , including @entity5 and @entity7			0
" but in an updated post , emergency officials say it could be as a result of various reasons			1
" while the substance is likely ash is from @entity35 , they are a number of volcanoes that are currently active , " they say			0
" the source of the material has not been scientifically confirmed			0
" and the ash may be from another part of the world			0
" the strong southerly flow from the jet stream could have brought it from an active volcano in southwest @entity46 , @entity47			1
but if we go farther west towards eastern @entity24 , there 's another active volcano there , " says @entity1 meteorologist @entity48			1
the @entity47 volcano is near @entity53 and erupted wednesday			2
the distances between the volcanoes and the @entity5 / @entity7 areas are staggering -- the @entity24 volcano is 4,000 miles away and the volcano in @entity47 is more than 2,000 miles away			1

@entity48 says the only way to be sure is to conduct scientific testing on the substance			1
