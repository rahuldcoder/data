-- @entity1 clinched a 22nd @entity3 league title on saturday when second - placed @entity4 could only draw 1 - 1 at @entity5			1
@entity4 's failure to win gave @entity1 back the crown after a one - year change in ownership , with @entity11 's team holding a seven - point advantage ahead of sunday 's trip to @entity14			1
real coach @entity15 made several changes following the midweek 6 - 2 win over @entity18 , with next friday 's @entity20 final against @entity14 in mind			0
however , @entity1 - based @entity5 took the lead in the 23rd minute through @entity23 , and @entity24 was unlucky to have a header ruled out following a seemingly innocuous goalmouth tussle with @entity27			1
midfielder @entity27 had come on in the 19th minute after young @entity29 defender @entity28 went off injured , while @entity15 brought on striker @entity30 at halftime			0
the later introduction of top scorer @entity33 led to @entity4 's 58th - minute equalizer as the @entity35 forward won a free - kick which @entity37 delivered perfectly for striker @entity38 to head home			1
tempers flared as @entity4 pressed for a winner to delay their rivals ' title confirmation , and @entity5 's @entity44 was sent off for a crude late tackle on @entity38 while 10 other bookings were handed out in the match			2
@entity33 had the chance to conjure up one of his trademark free - kicks after @entity44 departed , but blazed the ball into the stands			0
it continued @entity4 's poor away form , having drawn four and lost five games of 18 on the road , compared to 16 wins and two draws at home			2
earlier , @entity60 moved four points clear of the relegation zone with a 1 - 0 win at home to eighth - placed @entity65 , while @entity66 all but secured another year in the top flight with a 2 - 1 win over bottom club @entity69			2
@entity70 secured safety with three games to play as a 1 - 0 win over @entity74 left the visitors third from bottom			2
@entity77 @entity79 ' bid to beat the club 's best @entity81 points tally was foiled after the @entity84 champions drew 1 - 1 with @entity85 in saturday 's penultimate match of the season for the @entity89 side			1
@entity91 's team had hoped to beat the 91 posted by the @entity79 team in 2005 - 06 before being stripped of the title because of a match - fixing scandal , but can now only get to 90			0
the record is @entity96 's 97 in in 2006 - 07			0
@entity97 put visiting @entity85 ahead in the 12th minute but striker @entity98 leveled just after the hour mark , and @entity79 could not extend the club 's winning run to 10 matches			2
@entity103 consolidated ninth place with a 1 - 0 win over relegated @entity106			0
@entity107 champions @entity108 romped to a 28th victory from 33 games , winning 3 - 0 against @entity112 in a @entity114 derby which kicked off title celebrations as the team finally received the trophy which had been secured a month ago			1
the defeat left @entity112 in the relegation playoff place , on goal difference behind @entity121 ahead of the final round			0
@entity123 , who will play @entity108 in the @entity126 final , clinched second place with a 3 - 3 draw at @entity129 , needing two late goals from @entity131 to salvage a point			2
@entity133 consolidated third place with a 3 - 1 win over @entity136 -- the last goal from @entity138 put the @entity107 striker one ahead of @entity123 's @entity141 at the top of the @entity143 scoring charts on 24			1
@entity145 failed to clinch the fourth and final @entity126 place after losing 2 - 1 at home to @entity148 , whose @entity150 striker @entity149 netted both goals to take his tally to 15 this season -- putting him third equal with @entity108 's @entity156 and @entity158 's @entity157			1
fifth - placed @entity159 can go above @entity145 by beating the @entity161 finalists in the last round , but @entity158 's hopes were effectively ended by a 1 - 1 draw with @entity165			1
@entity29 second - placed @entity166 made @entity167 wait for a first title since 1994 by beating @entity169 2 - 1 on saturday , as @entity171 striker @entity170 scored both goals on his return from suspension			0
the result left @entity167 with a four - point lead ahead of sunday 's trip to @entity178 , after which there will be two rounds left			1
@entity181 clinched a return to @entity183 with a 1 - 0 win at @entity185 , ensuring there will be conflict with the @entity29 football authorities next season			0
the principality club is taking legal action after the ruling body announced that it wants to change the tax laws that allow @entity181 to pay less than other clubs across the border			0
other @entity29 teams fear that @entity181 's billionaire @entity198 owner @entity197 will embark on a spending spree similar to @entity167 's @entity201 benefactors that will create a duopoly in the division .			0

@entity4 's 1 - 1 draw at @entity5 gives @entity1 title with four games to play
@entity1 hold seven - point lead ahead of sunday 's trip to third - placed @entity14
@entity84 champions @entity79 held to 1 - 1 draw with @entity85 in penultimate game
@entity143 winners @entity108 continue to dominate with victory in @entity114 derby
