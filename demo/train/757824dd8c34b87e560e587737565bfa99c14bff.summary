-- after more than two years of hints and leaks , the long - awaited @entity2 phone appears to be almost ready for its debut			1
the device has been a prime example of " vaporware , " the term for rumored tech gadgets that everybody loves talking about despite the fact they do n't officially exist			0
and @entity2 has never confirmed that it 's making a smartphone			1
but the drumbeat is getting louder , and recent reports suggest the handset will hit the market soon			1
in the past week , tech blog @entity18 has posted images of what it says is that very phone , along with a report that users will control some features of the device just by tilting it at certain angles			2
that followed a report from @entity32 that @entity2 will roll out the phone by june and it will be on sale by september			1
both articles say the phone will include a groundbreaking technology : a screen that uses four cameras to produce hologram - like @entity41 images without the need for special glasses			1
in the @entity18 photos , the phone is cloaked in a protective shell that hides details of its design			0
the blog did not say how it acquired those images , but reported speaking with " multiple trusted sources			2
" in the past , @entity18 has accurately reported details about unannounced @entity2 products like its @entity55 tablets and @entity55 e-readers			1
the 3 - d model is one of two phones @entity2 plans to announce , the reports say , the other being a cheaper , less fancy one			1
the company that made its name in online retailing has been working on the phone for several years , according to reports			1
and , indeed , rumors of its existence have been floating around since at least 2011			0
@entity2 was long thought of primarily as a website			0
but since the success of its e-reader , the @entity55 , the company has increasingly become known for its hardware , too			1
the original kindle in 2007 was followed by the @entity55 tablet and , most recently , by @entity77 , a device that streams web content to your television			1
with the @entity77 , @entity2 has reaffirmed its products as competitors to similar hardware from @entity85 and @entity86 , as well as more targeted companies like @entity88 and @entity89			2
it makes sense that a phone would follow			0
and @entity2 appears to have chosen to take its time to roll out something unique instead of just jumping into a crowded market dominated by the @entity95 and a small handful of handsets running @entity86 's @entity99 operating system			0
" congratulations to @entity2 for thinking outside the box			0
if this is a hit it could be great news for both @entity2 and their customers , " wireless analyst @entity102 said			0
" it could be another @entity55 - like business			2
" but that success is n't guaranteed , even with @entity2 's expansive resources behind it , he said in a media release			2
" some companies like @entity85 , @entity86 and @entity113 are very successful in the smartphone space			0
however many more companies are trying with very little success , " @entity102 added			0
" the next biggest player is @entity118 and they only have a few percent market share			0

multiple reports suggest a new smartphone from @entity2 is coming soon
the phone will offer hologram - like @entity41 images , according to reports
once known for web sales , @entity2 has increasingly become a hardware company
the @entity55 line of tablets and e-readers has been a success for @entity2
