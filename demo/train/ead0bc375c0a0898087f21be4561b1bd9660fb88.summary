-- everyone knows the story of @entity3			0
here 's the story of @entity5			2
the @entity6 at @entity7 is the world 's tallest active geyser , but it 's unpredictable , sometimes waiting months or decades between eruptions			1
once , in the 1960s , it erupted 29 times in a year			0
it 's rare to be there when @entity6 wakes up			1
its eruptions are massive and impressive , reaching as high as 400 feet and lasting as long as 40 minutes			1
and the show does n't end there : a thick column of thundering steam spews for hours after an eruption , as if it 's a giant steam engine			1
@entity6 must have decided it was showtime again on wednesday			1
for the first time in eight years , and without warning , the geyser suddenly erupted in a massive spectacle , stunning those on the observation deck , who raced to pull out their cameras			1
" we estimate this eruption was about 200 to 300 feet high , and then it just steamed for about 24 hours , " said @entity7 spokesman @entity33			1
it took park rangers about two hours to get there			2
because of the number of geysers at @entity7 -- 300 , which is more than half of the world 's total -- rangers rely on electronic heat sensors placed at each geyser to tell them when one has gone off			1
@entity6 is in the @entity49 in @entity50			2
" when it jumps up , we know we 've had an eruption shoot up , " @entity33 said			0
with @entity6 , " we saw that jump and then some folks called that it happened			2
" @entity33 said only about 30 or 40 people saw it wednesday			0
now , fans are pumped up for the next unexpected show			0
" for us , it 's exciting			0
every time you 're down there , you wonder if that 'll be the time that it erupts , " he said			0
spend a lifetime exploring the @entity69			0
