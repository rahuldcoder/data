-- @entity1 has been preparing for an @entity3 invasion -- but perhaps it did n't expect a former @entity5 soldier to be leading the charge			1
at least on this occasion , @entity7 was n't armed with a @entity10 rifle when he marched into @entity11			1
this time , the 41 - year - old skated into @entity1 holding the @entity14 flag and an ice hockey stick -- not to mention the memories of a @entity18 triumph in his bag			1
not bad for a man who only realized he 'd been given the opportunity of a lifetime to become a star in the glitz and glamor of the @entity26 while serving in the @entity5 army back in 1991			1
" somebody came with the newspaper and showed me , " @entity28 tells @entity0 's human to @entity30 of his time in the barracks			1
" i had no idea i was going to be drafted -- i did n't know what the draft was			2
that came as a big surprise again and the team was the first - year team in the @entity26 , @entity43			1
" i did n't even know where it was ! i thought it was somewhere in @entity47 -- my association was completely off ! " then afterward when i found out what the draft meant and i found out who the team was , i started realizing , ' ok , this is something happening			1
' " what 's going to happen ? how is this all going to work out ? i had no clue but it worked out pretty good for me			2
" to say it worked out " pretty good " would be an understatement given @entity28 ' achievements			2
during a 15 - year @entity61 career , he won the @entity26 's biggest prize -- the @entity18 -- with the @entity63 and played in seven @entity64			1
ozolins scored 167 goals in 875 @entity26 appearances and made 397 assists with franchises also including @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 and @entity73			1
it was at @entity63 where @entity28 enjoyed his most successful time			2
@entity76 of his achievements was helping the @entity63 defeat @entity71 in the 1996 final of the @entity18 -- a series which his side won in emphatic fashion 4 - 0			1
even now , some 18 years later , the memory of that day remains fresh , although his memento of the day , his winner 's ring , has since managed to disappear			2
" that was the peak of the whole thing and , of course , i was young and i thought it 's going to continue like that for many , many years , " recalls @entity28			2
" i thought i was going to have a whole collection of these @entity18 but in reality , it worked out a little bit different			1
" ozolins suffered heartbreak the following year when the @entity63 was defeated in the @entity97 playoff final by @entity98			2
after starting skating at the age of five , it was not until he was 15 that the lure of ice hockey become irresistible			2
a number of appearances for the @entity5 junior national side followed before army service intervened			0
from there it was on to @entity47 , where his early success ended up earning @entity28 a $ 25 million deal with @entity70 in 2000			0
however , he failed to shine in @entity70 and moved on to @entity71 in january 2002 before ending up at @entity72 12 months later			0
he reached the 2003 @entity111 but the @entity72 lost 4 - 3 to the @entity112 , then a serious knee injury wrecked his time in @entity115 and he was traded to the @entity73 in march 2006			0
it was there that his off - rink problems began -- he was forced to enter the league 's substance abuse program after being found guilty of driving under the influence of alcohol			0
after taking a year out to deal with his demons , he took up a 12 - month deal in a return to @entity43 -- but after that rejected the chance to play a further season with the @entity129 , and instead returned to @entity14 in 2009			1
but that was not to prove the end of his career -- far from it			0
" i took a year off in hockey and basically , i thought i was retired , " he recalls			0
" that 's how i understood it but it turned out that i only took a year off and then the general manager of @entity138 gave me a call and asked when i was thinking about coming home and playing for the team			1
" i told him , ' give me two weeks , i 'll let you know			0
' so during those two weeks , i started training again and i wanted to see if i wanted to play			0
" i wanted to play on a level where i would n't just be a mascot on a team but able to contribute on the ice			1
" after two weeks i said , ' ok , i can do it , ' and it was like coming home			0
that 's where i began my career , my professional career			0
it 's my childhood , this is my home			0
" now back playing in the @entity159 with @entity138 , @entity158 is hoping to help his home country impress on the international stage			0
as a true veteran of the game , this may be the final time he gets to compete in front of billions watching across the globe			0
@entity14 is not expected to challenge for a medal at the @entity168 but the opportunity to appear at the @entity3 for a third time is something which @entity28 says he will relish for the rest of his life -- especially after being @entity14 's flag bearer at last week 's opening ceremony			1
" for us to go to @entity1 , i only realized when we qualified how much it meant not just to us but also for the people that were at the arena and the whole country , " he says			0
" we 're going to have all these experiences , @entity3 experiences			1
it 's indescribable how much energy you get from that			0
" being with the best winter athletes in the world at the time , in the same village , eating lunch next to figure skaters , skiers or bobsled teams , it 's -- especially for younger guys but even for me -- it 's so much			0
" if winning trophies and cups on a club level is one thing , then @entity3 is more of a national pride			1
it 's more being there for your country and representing your country			0
