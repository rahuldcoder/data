@entity2 @entity1 sen. @entity0 says she has the 60 votes she needs for the @entity4 to advance a measure tuesday that would authorize construction of the @entity7			1
@entity0 has been scrambling to attract at least 15 @entity1 to join 45 republicans to reach the critical 60 - vote procedural threshold			1
she told reporters at the @entity11 on monday night that she 'd reached that mark			0
" i feel very comfortable , " @entity0 said			2
at least 14 @entity1 have said they will support the measure			0
but it 's not clear who has agreed to provide the final vote or whether @entity0 's comments simply reflect optimism			1
one of @entity0 's top targets , @entity21 sen. @entity20 , said it wo n't be him			1
another target , @entity25 sen. @entity24 , an independent who caucuses with the @entity1 , said he is leaning against supporting the bill			0
if she can shepherd the legislation through the @entity4 , it would allow @entity0 to demonstrate her influence one last time ahead of a dec. 6 run - off election in @entity2 , where she faces @entity32 rep. @entity32 , who sponsored the bill authorizing the pipeline when the @entity34 approved it on friday			1
if the @entity4 ultimately passes the @entity7 bill , a confrontation could emerge between @entity38 and president @entity39			2
the president said at a news conference late last week that he does n't want @entity38 to intervene in the @entity42 's long - running consideration of the project -- and offered his most specific critique of it yet			0
" understand what this project is : it is providing the ability of @entity50 to pump their oil , send it through our land , down to the @entity55 , where it will be sold everywhere else			0
it does n't have an impact on @entity62 gas prices , " @entity39 said at a friday news conference in @entity58 .			0

at least 60 senators will vote to advance legislation authorizing the @entity7 , sen. @entity0 says
the @entity2 @entity68 is trying to pass the bill in time to help in her dec. 6 run - off election against @entity71 @entity32
