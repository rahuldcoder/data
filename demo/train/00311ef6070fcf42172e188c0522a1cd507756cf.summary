did you ever wonder what happens to your old laptop or cellphone when you throw it away ? chances are some of your old electronic junk will end up in @entity7			1
according to a recent @entity11 report , " @entity7 now appears to be the largest e-waste dumping site in the world			1
" e-waste , or electronic waste , consists of everything from scrapped tvs , refrigerators and air conditioners to that old desktop computer that may be collecting dust in your closet			1
many of these gadgets were initially manufactured in @entity7			1
through a strange twist of global economics , much of this electronic junk returns to @entity7 to die			1
" according to @entity11 data , about 70 % of electronic waste globally generated ended up in @entity7 , " said @entity27 , a spokesman for the @entity29 office of @entity30			1
" much of [ the e-waste ] comes through illegal channels because under @entity11 conventions , there is a specific ban on electronic waste being transferred from developed countries like the @entity40 to countries like @entity7 and @entity42			1
" for the past decade , the southeastern town of @entity44 , nestled in @entity7 's main manufacturing zone , has been a major hub for the disposal of e-waste			1
hundreds of thousands of people here have become experts at dismantling the world 's electronic junk			1
on seemingly every street , laborers sit on the pavement outside workshops ripping out the guts of household appliances with hammers and drills			2
the roads in @entity44 are lined with bundles of plastic , wires , cables and other garbage			1
different components are separated based on their value and potential for re-sale			2
on one street sits a pile of green and gold circuit boards			2
on another , the metal cases of desktop computers			2
at times , it looks like workers are reaping some giant plastic harvest , especially when women stand on roadsides raking ankle - deep " fields " of plastic chips			0
in one workshop , men sliced open sacks of these plastic chips , which they then poured into large vats of fluid			0
they then used shovels and their bare hands to stir this synthetic stew			0
" we sell this plastic to @entity105 , " one of the workers said , referring to a @entity98 company that manufactures products for many global electronics companies , including @entity101 , @entity102 and @entity103			2
dirty , dangerous work this may be one of the world 's largest informal recycling operations for electronic waste			1
in one family - run garage , workers seemed to specialize in sorting plastic from old televisions and cars into different baskets			0
" if this plastic cup has a hole in it , you throw it away , " said a man who ran the operation , pointing to a pink plastic mug			0
" we take it and re-sell it			0
" but recycling in @entity44 is dirty , dangerous work			1
" when recycling is done properly , it 's a good thing for the environment , " said @entity27 , the @entity30 spokesman in @entity29			1
" but when recycling is done in primitive ways like we have seen in @entity7 with the electronic waste , it is hugely devastating for the local environment			1
" according to the april 2013 @entity11 report " e-waste in @entity7 , " @entity44 suffered an " environmental calamity " as a result of the wide - scale e-waste disposal industry in the area			1
much of the toxic pollution comes from burning circuit boards , plastic and copper wires , or washing them with hydrochloric acid to recover valuable metals like copper and steel			0
in doing so , workshops contaminate workers and the environment with toxic heavy metals like lead , beryllium and cadmium , while also releasing hydrocarbon ashes into the air , water and soil , the report said			1
for first - time visitors to @entity44 , the air leaves a burning sensation in the eyes and nostrils			1
toxic tech studies by the @entity171 revealed that many children tested in @entity44 had higher than average levels of lead in their blood , which can stunt the development of the brain and central nervous system			1
piles of technological scrap had been dumped in a muddy field just outside of town			2
there , water buffalo grazed and soaked themselves in ponds surrounded by piles of electronic components with labels like @entity103 , @entity190 , @entity191 and @entity102			2
the enormous animals casually stomped through mounds of sheet glass , which clearly had been removed from video monitors			0
flat screen displays often use mercury , a highly toxic metal			0
" releases of mercury can occur during the dismantling of equipment such as flat screen displays , " wrote @entity30 , in a report titled " @entity209 " " incineration or landfilling can also result in releases of mercury to the environment ... that can bioaccumulate and biomagnify to high levels in food chains , particularly in fish			1
" most of the workers in @entity44 involved in the e-waste business are migrants from destitute regions of @entity7 and poorly educated			1
many of them downplayed the potential damage the industry could cause to their health			0
they asked only to use their family names , to protect their identity			0
" of course it is n't healthy , " said @entity226 , a woman who was rapidly sorting plastic shards from devices like computer keyboards , remote controls and even computer mice			0
she and her colleagues burned plastic using lighters and blow - torches to identify different kinds of material			0
" but there are families that have lived here for generations ... and there is little impact on their health , " she said			2
several migrants said that while the work is tough , it allows them more freedom than working on factory lines where young children are not permitted to enter the premises and working hours are stringent			0
used to be worse despite the environmental degradation and toxic fumes permeating the air , many in @entity44 said that conditions have improved dramatically over the years			2
" i remember in 2007 , when i first came here , there was a flood of trash , " said @entity259 , a 20 - year - old man who ferried bundles of electronic waste around on a motorcycle with a trailer attached to it			2
" before people were washing metals , burning things and it severely damaged people 's lungs , " @entity259 added			0
" but now , compared to before , the [ authorities ] have cracked down pretty hard			0
" but residents who did not work in the e-waste business offered a very different take on the pollution in @entity44			1
a group of farmers who had migrated from neighboring @entity282 province to cultivate rice in @entity44 told @entity284 they did not dare drink the local well water			1
they claimed if they tried to wash clothes and linens with the water , it turned fabrics yellow			0
the head of the group , who identified himself as @entity295 , had another shocking admission			0
" it may not sound nice , but we do n't dare eat the rice that we farm because it 's planted here with all the pollution , " @entity295 said , pointing at water - logged rice paddy next to him			0
asked who did eat the harvested rice , @entity295 answered : " how should i know ? a lot of it is sold off ... they do n't dare label the rice from here as ' grown in @entity44			1
' they 'll write that its rice from some other place			0
" not that surprising considering that the latest food scandal to hit the country earlier this month is cadmium - laced rice			0
officials in @entity318 , roughly 400 kilometers away from @entity44 , found high rates of cadmium in rice and rice products			1
according to the city 's @entity324 samples pulled from a local restaurant , food seller and two university canteens showed high levels of cadmium in rice and rice noodles			2
officials did not specify how the contaminated rice entered the city 's food supply			0
@entity284 made several attempts to contact the @entity44 town government			1
government officials refused to comment on the electronic waste issue and hung up the phone			2
however , it did appear that government efforts to restrict imports of foreign waste are reducing the flow of e-trash here			0
" why are they stopping the garbage from reaching us ? " asked one man who ran a plastic sorting workshop			0
" of course it 's hurting our business , " he added			0
domestic e-waste grows the @entity7 government had some success regulating e-waste disposal with a " @entity358 , " which was tested from 2009 to 2011			1
with the help of generous government subsidies , the program collected tens of millions of obsolete home appliances , according to the @entity11 even if @entity7 authorities succeed in limiting smuggled supplies of foreign garbage , the @entity11 warns that the country is rapidly generating its own supply of e-waste			1
" domestic generation of e-waste has risen rapidly as a result of technological and economic development , " the @entity11 reported			1
it cited statistics showing an exponential surge in sales of tv 's , refrigerators , washing machines , air conditioners and computers in @entity7 over a 16 - year period			2
to avoid a vicious cycle of pollution , resulting from both the manufacture and disposal of appliances , @entity30 has lobbied for manufacturers to use fewer toxic chemicals in their products			2
the organization also has a message for consumers who seem to swap their phones , tablets and other computer devices with increasing frequency			0
" think about where your mobile phone or where your gadgets go , " said @entity27 , the @entity30 activist			0
" when you think about changing [ your phone ] , or buying a new product , always think about the footprint that you put on this planet			0

@entity11 report : " @entity7 now appears to be the largest e-waste dumping site in the world "
products originally produced in @entity7 are now finding their way back as electronic junk
the small town of @entity44 as been a major hub for the disposal of e-waste
" when recycling is done in primitive ways ... it is hugely devastating for the local environment "
