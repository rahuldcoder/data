@entity0 -- you might not consider baseball or basketball players to be your typical business travelers			1
but the realities of life for professional athletes , whose job requires them to spend months on the road each year , means they become every bit as travel hardened as the most experienced sales executive			1
golf legend @entity15 claims to have racked up about 15 million miles during his career , while @entity18 teams play 162 - games a season , traveling across the @entity21 in the process			2
@entity23 , director of team travel for baseball outfit the @entity26 , says his team spends nearly a third of the year on the road , so they look for comfort			0
the team stays in luxury hotels , with good 24 - hour room service , and privacy and security are major concerns			1
sporting events are big business for the travel industry , with the @entity40 estimating they account for more than a quarter of the entire travel market -- worth about $ 182 billion a year in the @entity21 alone			2
for the hotels that do play host to traveling sports clubs , although those teams might only comprise a relatively small percentage of a hotel 's trade , their reliability makes them an important part of their business			1
increasingly , hotels are pulling out all the stops to cater to the particular needs of their high - profile guests			1
see also : @entity15 , road warrior that means many hotels boasting state - of - the - art gym equipment , to allow athletes to work out on the road			1
but it also means putting special procedures in place to give sports stars the most comfortable guest experience			0
@entity0 is a sports - mad city			1
its teams -- including baseball 's @entity68 , football 's @entity70 , basketball 's @entity72 and hockey 's @entity74 -- have won championships in every major @entity21 sport			1
local hotels the @entity79 and the @entity80 are no strangers to visiting sports stars			0
@entity83 , general manager of the @entity84 , said about half of the baseball teams that come to town to play the @entity68 stay at his hotel			0
" when you get into the summer months , we might be checking one baseball team out and checking another one right back in , " he said			0
@entity23 said that typically , when the @entity26 check in , the hotel staff have each player 's key packet laid out on a desk ready to go , so the entire team can be checked in a matter of minutes			1
@entity83 explained : " the key is to get them in and up as quickly as possible , so that the big stars ... are n't bothered by the autograph seekers and that sort of thing			0
" at @entity105 , general manager @entity104 says her staff whisks athletes in via a secret entrance unknown to the general public			0
" we have a private back entrance and no other hotel guests know about this , " she said			2
" we always have two elevator attendants , so both elevators are used exclusively for the professional sports teams that 's coming in			0
" @entity104 said that by bypassing the regular check - in in the lobby , her team can have the arriving athletes in their rooms in " four minutes door to door			1
" athletes have certain requirements that the average guest does n't			2
some need extra-long beds and , because they spend so much time on the road , some have complicated family arrangements , requiring tact in deciding which rooms to place them in			0
" i would say that things can get a little complicated when families start to arrive , especially if somebody has multiple ex-wives , kids , " said @entity104			0
" you really get to understand a little bit better somebody 's family dynamic , and how to handle that and where the connecting rooms should be and which floors they should be on			0
" @entity83 said football teams in particular had special demands around food and drink			2
" @entity151 teams want to make sure we have on every floor @entity153 , @entity155 , fruit , " he said			0
" you know football players eat a lot so we need to keep them with enough food all the time to keep them busy			2
