-- @entity1 , @entity2 , is the parish seat of the " most unequal place in @entity5 , " meaning it has a higher rate of income inequality than any other parish or county			1
and until somewhat recently , the poor side of town was missing a key @entity13 feature			1
i visited the place last year for a @entity16 story , and it was immediately obvious the barrier between rich and poor is both economic and geographic			2
there 's an oxbow lake -- @entity1 -- that divides a largely rich white neighborhood from a primarily poorer black one			1
i was surprised to find there 's not all that much interaction between each side of the lake , which i found reflective of a national " empathy gap			2
" after the story published , a reader flagged for me the fact that , at the time , you could n't search the poor side of @entity1 using @entity32			1
the poor side of town was invisible in that way			1
i noticed last week that that 's now changed , praise be to @entity13 ! i 'm not sure why , since the company 's press office has n't answered my questions about it			1
but i 'm pleased , no matter what the reason			0
i think one issue with poverty in @entity5 is that it 's too often unseen , regardless of what columnist @entity46 thinks			0
that @entity13 left the poor side of @entity1 without @entity32 probably was n't intentional , but it was highly symbolic			1
i 'm glad that neighborhood is now included -- not so people can gawk at it but so it 's on even technological footing with the richer side			2
here 's how @entity13 explained the omission in november : " we try to cover as many streets as possible but occasionally we miss the odd one or two -- for example there may have been road work that day , a street may have been inaccessible or simply because of human error our drivers may have missed a street , " a spokeswoman said in an email to me			2
" it 's also possible that we did drive a certain street , but discovered that when processing the imagery , the photographs collected did not meet our high quality imagery standards due to unforeseeable challenges like shadows , poor visibility conditions , etc. hopefully we can come back and photograph it at a future date			0
" " it was n't for any reason about the demographics or anything like that -- or it being a poor area , " spokeswoman @entity78 added at the time			0
" that does not factor into our decisions in any way to map areas			0
we 're constantly updating this imagery and we 're constantly trying to make it as accurate as possible			0
... we want the whole world to be mapped , that 's our eventual goal			0
we want people to be able to explore different areas			0
" in other @entity1 news , volunteers this year finished painting a hopeful mural near the center of town			0
it shows an image of @entity101 , a college student who was featured at the start of the video i produced with @entity0 's @entity105			1
i hope to learn more about progress in @entity1 in coming months			0
and the @entity107 tells me it is scheduled to release new data on income inequality by county in december , which may offer new insight .			1

@entity113 , @entity2 , has the highest income inequality in the nation
the parish seat , @entity1 , has a lake that divides rich from poor
@entity0 's @entity120 says @entity32 *previously* did not show the poor side
he writes that that 's since changed ; he *applauds* @entity13 , whatever the reason
