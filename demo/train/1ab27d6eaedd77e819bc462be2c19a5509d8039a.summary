-- ireporters @entity1 and @entity3 are students at the @entity5 in @entity6			1
as part of a class project , they were challenged to see if they could touch someone 's life using their design skills			1
both commute by bus , so they decided to thank the bus drivers of the @entity19 route by giving them specially designed seat cushions			1
on november 18 , 2011 , @entity21 and @entity3 handed out over 50 cushions , and @entity23 captured the reaction			1
the team felt the project was a success and proof that small gesture can make a big impact			0
@entity21 and @entity3 shared their experience in this @entity32 by responding to @entity0 questions jointly over e-mail			2
@entity35 : giving back to the @entity36 @entity0 : how did it start ? @entity21 and @entity3 : this project was inspired and curated through @entity39 's class " @entity41 's heart ? " our target audience was a group of people we did not know			1
after spending a few months together in our first year at @entity46 , @entity1 and i found we both commute via the @entity19 bus line to school every day			2
the @entity19 is one of the busiest bus routes in @entity52 , serving over 16.5 million commuters a year			0
the life of a bus driver is not always easy , making them our target market for this specific assignment			2
@entity0 : describe what you did			0
@entity21 and @entity3 : the life of a @entity19 bus driver can go unnoticed at times , but a thank you is a start towards a better appreciation for their efforts and hard work			1
as graduate design students at @entity5 , we wanted to express our gratitude by creating custom designed butt cushions to help soften the ride for @entity19 bus drivers			1
we also invited customers and bus drivers alike to visit our social network site dedicated to the @entity19 line where people can share their thank yous and stories about their local bus commutes			2
@entity0 : why is it important ? @entity21 and @entity3 : this project is important because it extends a thank you to a group of people that is often unnoticed and under - gratified			1
this project also inspires others to extend a simple thank you or even repeat something similar			0
our hopes in this project are to inspire other cities to do a similar project , creating a network and a strong social response			0
@entity0 : how are you making an impact ? @entity21 and @entity3 : we have had great response and feedback from the community through our blog and on other sites like @entity0 's @entity35			2
we believe it is giving people a second chance to thank their bus driver or other type of service workers			0
we are in the process of further extending this project out to the entire line of the @entity19 drivers ( over 400 drivers ) , and future @entity6 bus lines			1
find us on @entity120 in the coming weeks to give us a helping hand			0
@entity0 : why should other people get involved ? @entity21 and @entity3 : we believe that by extending appreciation and gratitude to people that serve our community , it in turn helps create a better environment for us all			1
the bus community has relished in our recent attempt to create awareness and appreciation throughout , and we are determined and confident that by doing so , more commuters and cities will take a moment to share a thank you			0
what are you doing to @entity141 ? we want to hear your story about how you or someone you know is making a difference in the lives of others			0
