a long - awaited @entity1 environmental report on the proposed @entity3 oil pipeline indicates what the oil industry and its backers have been saying -- it wo n't have a big impact on carbon emissions that cause climate change			1
the report released friday appears to give the @entity12 administration the cover it needs to approve the politically charged project , but not until may at the earliest , after a 90 - day review and comment period			1
environmentalists reacted with predictable fury , accusing the government of bad intent by releasing the report before an inspector general 's findings on whether it was flawed because some participants had oil industry ties			1
" this document will be seen by the entire environmental community ... as a sham , " complained @entity28 rep. @entity27 of @entity29 , adding that " it encourages the already widely held impression that the fix was in from the beginning			0
" @entity38 spokesman @entity37 said friday night that information in the report " will now need to be closely evaluated by @entity39 and other relevant agency heads in the weeks ahead			0
" a decision on whether the project is in the national interest will be made only after careful consideration of the ( report ) and other pertinent information , comments from the public , and views of other agency heads			2
" @entity52 : no more stalling supporters , including @entity52 leaders who have been pushing for two years for president @entity12 to approve the project , said now it was time to get it started			1
" mr. president , no more stalling , no more excuses , " said @entity58 leader @entity58 of @entity59 , adding a jab at @entity12 's recent pledge to act on his own this year if he ca n't get congressional backing			2
" please pick up that pen you 've been talking so much about and make this happen			0
" the pipeline that would transport oil from @entity72 to the @entity73 has been a political football , pitting the oil industry and its @entity52 backers against environmentalists and liberal democrats who complain it bolsters the especially dirty fossil fuel production from the tar sands of northern @entity82			1
the project also has sparked protests from the political left and the environmental movement			0
however , the politics get messy for @entity28 , because organized labor supports the project that will create several thousand jobs			0
release of the report launched a 90 - day period for public comment and consultation			1
secretary of state @entity95 , who is known for his effort to combat climate change , will then determine if the pipeline project is in the national interest			0
the environmental analysis makes no final conclusion on the merits of the project , but says it would n't impact how much oil gets produced from @entity72 's tar sands in northern @entity82			2
dirtier oil approval or denial of any single project was unlikely to affect how much oil gets extracted from the tar sands , assistant secretary of state @entity107 said in a conference call with reporters			0
@entity115 noted that the oil from the tar sands was more carbon intensive than normal oil , producing 17 % more carbon emissions			2
environmentalists say that is why the project should be rejected , arguing that it would continue @entity68 reliance on a dirtier foreign oil at a time when @entity12 has pledged action against climate change			1
" i will not be satisfied with any analysis that does not accurately document what is really happening on the ground when it comes to the extraction , transport , refining , and waste disposal of dirty , filthy tar sands oil , " said @entity28 sen. @entity130 of @entity131			0
in a speech last year on climate change , @entity12 said the pipeline should be approved only if it is basically carbon - neutral , meaning that approving it would have no more impact on climate change that not approving it			1
the president and ceo of @entity151 , the company proposing the pipeline , said friday that the environmental report makes clear the benefits of the project to the @entity68 economy , including $ 3.4 billion in added economic activity from its construction			1
asked about increased carbon emissions , @entity158 said the report determined that " oil sands are gon na get produced anyway			2
" " when you read the report carefully , it makes clear that blocking @entity3 is an important component of climate sanity and we will find out if @entity95 and particularly @entity12 are ever willing to stand up to the oil industry or not , " said environmental activist @entity162 , founder of 350.org			1
messy politics for @entity28 @entity28 from energy states , such as sen. @entity172 of @entity173 , face tough re-election battles this fall and therefore want to see the pipeline approved to help a major industry for their constituents			0
they have criticized the administration for taking several years to review it			0
this year , @entity12 has made holding onto the @entity181 in november a political priority			0
in 2011 , the @entity12 administration postponed a decision on the pipeline until last year , citing concerns raised by @entity188 officials and environmental groups about the original route near the @entity191 , which provides drinking water for much of @entity188 and is important for the state 's agricultural economy			1
republicans accused @entity12 of putting off the issue until after the november 2012 election , but their efforts to force an earlier decision failed to work			2
meanwhile , @entity151 rerouted it in @entity188			0
the @entity1 is handling the review because the project crosses an international border with @entity72 .			1

pipeline supporters approve , environmentalists *condemn* the report
the proposed oil pipeline between the @entity68 and @entity72 is politically charged
next step is a 90 - day comment period , followed by another @entity1 decision
president @entity12 has said the pipeline must be carbon - neutral
