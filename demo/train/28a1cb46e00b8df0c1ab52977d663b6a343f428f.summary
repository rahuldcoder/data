-- we just ca n't leave well - enough alone			1
in 1960 , the movie " @entity3 " opened in theaters , marking the first and only official attempt at @entity6 , in which strategic odors were emitted during the film from little pipes near the seats			1
at the time , it was big thinking and an interesting draw for moviegoers , sort of like the collective asthma attack everyone developed a few years ago for modern 3 - d. which i think most of us will now agree is more trouble than it 's worth			1
before @entity6 , other motion pictures had unsuccessfully tried to use aromas in disjointed and haphazard ways			1
but in " @entity3 , " new , specific patented technology was developed to actually drive the plot			1
and that had n't been done before			1
fortunately , the storyline had nothing to do with @entity31 getting sick from bad oysters			1
though the reviews might 've been interesting			1
" i liked it up until the 30 - minute bathroom scene			2
" " @entity3 " was eventually de-odorized and retitled " holiday in @entity38 , " at which point @entity6 was neatly tucked away in the vault of @entity43 bad ideas			1
it now shares that space with game footage from the @entity47			2
but more than 60 years later , a startup company in @entity49 is bringing back the @entity6 concept for a smaller screen			1
@entity52 , the one on your phone			2
sexting just got way more interesting			2
they call this thing @entity57 , and it 's a thumb - drive - sized atomizer that plugs into your mobile device so it can be triggered to release specific odors on command			1
however , the major design limitation is that it can release only one specific fragrance from whatever scent tank you happen to have inserted into the atomizer			2
so @entity67 help you if you suddenly want to smell " @entity68 " but accidentally left the house with " @entity70			2
" git - @entity71 ! holding but one fragrance tank at a time definitely steals some of the potential fun , for it also seems unlikely that you could remotely sneak attack a friend who 's on a first date , digitally wafting his table with the putrid stink of rotten eggs			2
not that it would necessarily change things			0
" @entity83 , @entity84 , did you just pass gas ? " " yes			0
" naturally , this new little gizmo is still in development , but they hope to have it out in markets by the fall for both @entity94 and @entity95			1
which , sadly , will be months too late for strategically teaming up with @entity97 so tech - savvy music fans can olfactorily brag to everyone back home with the familiar summer festival smell of a hot @entity102			0
" sounds like @entity104 is having fun			0
" " do n't you mean smells like @entity104 is having fun ? " " @entity108 ! yes			0
" but the sky seems to be the limit for @entity113 , so long as we agree that the sky is rather low and remarkably pointless			1
that said , the company is being smart and releasing a software development kit to encourage outsiders to hack away at new , creative uses for different smells			0
so , you never know			0
perhaps there 's hope for something interesting			1
i just ca n't think of what that might be			0
nevertheless , @entity113 thinks there are possibilities ranging from the pleasant to the completely absurd			1
for instance , they excitedly ponder the possibility of concert venues handing out tanks of sweat for fans to truly experience the closeness of their favorite performer on stage			0
clearly , they 've never been to a @entity141 concert			0
one somewhat practical application , they say , might also be for game play , where , say , a shooting game could be programmed to release the smell of gunpowder			0
or a driving game might enhance the experience with burning rubber			0
come to think of it , maybe even @entity152 could be designed to smell like your mom 's basement			0
you know , just in case you happen to emerge from the darkness to play the game somewhere else			0
not that you 'd want to			0
at least it has indoor plumbing .			0

@entity113 attaches to mobile devices and can be triggered to emit odors
@entity6 was used in movie theaters in 1960
developers hope to make it available in the fall
