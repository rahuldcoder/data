-- a former " enemy combatant " who was held in a @entity8 @entity7 brig for six years with no charges was sentenced thursday to eight years and four months in prison , a @entity2 spokesman said			1
@entity10 pleaded guilty in federal court in @entity12 in may to conspiring to provide material support to a terrorist organization			1
he could have received a maximum of 15 years in prison			1
" this administration is committed to bringing terrorists to justice for their crimes , " @entity2 spokesman @entity17 said			2
" @entity22 , who has been in @entity25 custody since december 2001 , was dispatched by the highest levels of @entity27 to carry out its terrorist objectives in @entity25			2
" a defense attorney for the @entity31 citizen , who had been a student at @entity32 in @entity33 , @entity12 , when he was arrested , said the judge ruled on a lesser sentence to reflect the nearly six years @entity10 already spent at the @entity7 brig in @entity37 , @entity8			1
" we 're pleased with the result , " said the attorney , @entity38			2
" mr. @entity10 is also very pleased			1
" @entity41 was transferred to a federal prison in @entity12 in march after president @entity43 ordered a review of his case			1
the case was ultimately referred to the @entity2 , which filed charges			2
the @entity48 said he trained at a terror camp in @entity51 , met @entity27 leaders @entity53 and @entity54 and " volunteered for a martyr mission , " according to court documents filed earlier in the case			1
according to a copy of his plea agreement , @entity10 admitted that he " knowingly conspired and agreed with @entity54 " to provide support to @entity27 and to work under the organization 's direction and control			1
" between 1998 and 2001 , the defendant attended various training camps because he wished to engage in jihad , " the document said			0
while in the training camps and in @entity27 safe houses in @entity69 , he was known by the name @entity71 al - qatari , according to the plea agreement			0
@entity54 approached @entity10 in 2001 about his offer to assist @entity27 , the plea agreement said			1
" the defendant was instructed by @entity54 to enter the @entity25 no later than september 10 , 2001 , with an understanding that he was to remain in the @entity25 for an undetermined length of time , " the documents said			0
@entity22 applied to @entity32 using the same e-mail address he used to communicate with @entity54 , the plea agreement said			0
at @entity32 , he " rarely attended classes and was in a failing status by the end of his first semester			0
" on september 21 , 2001 , @entity10 traveled to another central @entity12 university and created five e-mail accounts under different aliases , the documents said			1
" by this time , the defendant knew that @entity27 was responsible for the september 11 , 2001 , attacks on the @entity25 and fully understood why @entity54 had directed him to be in the @entity25 before that date			0
" he used the new e-mail accounts to inform @entity54 of his whereabouts and activities , and also gave him his cell phone number in encoded format , according to the plea agreement			0
in addition , he conducted online research " related to various cyanide compounds			0
the defendant 's focus was on various cyanide substances ... the defendant reviewed toxicity levels , the locations where these items could be purchased , and specific pricing of the compounds , " the documents said			0
he also explored obtaining sulfuric acid			0
an almanac found at @entity10 's residence was bookmarked " at pages showing dams , waterways and tunnels in the @entity25 , " the plea agreement said			2
@entity41 initially was arrested on credit card fraud charges in december 2001			1
but his continued confinement without charges mushroomed into a major legal case before federal prosecutors filed charges in february			2
the @entity127 ruled on march 6 that @entity10 's case was rendered moot by a decision to indict him on federal conspiracy charges , and granted the @entity43 administration 's request to dismiss his challenge of the president 's unilateral authority to detain him indefinitely without charges			1
he was transferred to civilian custody and taken to @entity12 in march			0
the court 's ruling , however , meant that the larger constitutional issue of the president 's power to detain accused terrorists and other criminals in the @entity25 remains unresolved			0
@entity0 's @entity145 contributed to this report .			0
