-- only innovation can reduce illness and poverty in @entity4 , according to a program that is funding creative approaches to healthcare in developing countries			1
more than 50,000 women die each year of cervical cancer in @entity4 , according to @entity12 estimates , as more than 80 % of the cases are detected in late stages			2
in countries such as @entity17 , where nearly 4,500 women die annually from the disease , the problem is exacerbated by an acute shortage of medical experts and a lack of quality screening services , especially in rural areas			0
but now a group of @entity27 and @entity17 health innovators have joined forces to apply simple and safe mobile technologies to improve cervical cancer screening and thus potentially reduce mortality rates in the @entity33 country			1
the idea is to send teams of two trained non-physician healthcare workers in remote @entity17 to examine women living several hours away from health centers			0
the nurses , who will be equipped with cervical screening and treatment tools as well as standard smartphones , will take a photograph of the cervix with their phone and send it via sms to a medical expert in a specialized clinic			0
trained doctors will then be able to review the image immediately and text the diagnosis back to the health worker , as well as give instructions about treatment			0
" that 's the beauty of it -- for early grade cancers , those will be able to be treated right in the field , right in the rural area , " says dr @entity55 , of @entity56 , @entity57 , the principal investigator of the @entity59			0
read : how the cell phone can improve health care the effectiveness of the idea will be put to the test in the coming months as @entity55 was named thursday amongst the 68 innovators to receive $ 100,000 canadian grants to pursue bold concepts for tackling health issues in developing countries			1
in total , some $ 7 million has been awarded to 51 innovators in 18 low and middle - income countries , and to 17 @entity27 projects , by @entity79 , a group sponsoring breakthrough concepts to improve health in poor parts of the world			1
thirty - eight of these projects will be implemented in @entity4			1
" this is probably the largest pipeline of innovation in global health from the developing world , " says @entity86 , chief executive of @entity79 , which is funded by the @entity27 government			1
" it shows that poor countries are very rich in ideas because talent is everywhere , opportunity is not , and what we are trying to do is to bring opportunity to talent to improve health			1
" amongst the @entity4 - based projects is a new trading system in @entity104 where researchers will create a barcoded vaccination card that people can redeem for farm seeds and fertilizer as part of efforts to encourage vaccination of children			1
@entity114 , of the @entity115 , says the project " would powerfully incentivize parents to seek and adhere to their children 's immunization schedule even when hard pressed financially to reach a distant vaccination center			0
the idea is a practical solution that would significantly boost small farm productivity and incomes for poor households while safeguarding the general health of children in farming villages through up - to - date immunizations			2
" read : how ' @entity130 ' will shape @entity4 's future other programs include restoring native freshwater prawns in @entity134 to eat the populations of snails that are responsible for the spreading of the parasitic disease schistosomiasis ; paying youth in @entity139 to collect and sort garbage and deliver it to a plant for conversion to fertilizer and biogas in order to improve sanitation ; and anti-diarrhea kits for children hitching a ride on @entity151 's distribution chain to improve the availability of life - saving drugs			2
@entity79 says it will repeat its stars in @entity156 program every six months , funding hundreds of projects over the coming years			2
it also plans to work with partners to provide scale - up funding of up to $ 1 million to those ideas that are proved to be successful so that they can have a bigger impact in a more sustainable way			1
@entity86 says that many of the traditional approaches when it comes to aid have proved to be inadequate			0
instead , he argues , fostering innovation and investing in the ideas of the people can be an effective exit strategy from poverty			0
" there are only two ways for a country to develop , there 's only two sources of wealth in the world , " he says			0
" either you mine the ground for resources and minerals , if you do that in a non-corrupt manner , or you mine the brains of your citizens for their bold ideas and help them to create social enterprises , to create businesses that can improve the local conditions in a broader scale			2
" he adds : " i do think that these innovators can help the problems of their community -- in fact , they are the only thing that can			0
