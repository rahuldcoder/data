many female travelers are scrubbing @entity1 off their destination lists after the horrific gang rape and murder of a @entity6 student in december 2012			1
according to the @entity7 , 35 % less women visited @entity1 in the three months after the attack compared to the same period last year			1
since december , rapes have persisted and mass protests have erupted across the country , pointing at inefficiency in dealing with such crimes and an inherent patriarchal nature			2
but there 's one clear observation from the outcry : some of the voices belong to @entity1 's men			1
" every time i look into the mirror , i want to see a man whose mother , sister , wife and daughter are proud to call their own , " says renowned @entity23 actor and director @entity22 on the website of his movement formed in march called @entity27 --- @entity27			0
distributing plastic moustaches -- a symbol of masculinity -- at the cricket ground of @entity39 in @entity40 in april , @entity22 is using his influence to encourage men to become " real @entity43 " -- also meaning " men " in the national language of @entity46			2
he is setting out a plan of action with @entity49 --- an established @entity50 in @entity1 -- that uses sport to engage children from poorer communities , teaching values such as the importance of education , health and gender equality			1
" young people in @entity1 do n't have good role models aside from @entity23 and sports people , " says @entity59 , @entity49 founder			1
" @entity22 is a great voice addressing young people			0
" @entity65 , 22 , is one of around 10,000 youth leaders recruited from within communities to deliver the @entity50 's programs			0
she says boys are aware of the rape problem and the need for change			1
" but somewhere in their minds , they see girls as weak , " she adds			0
the programs focus on building confidence in girls , for example , to ask for the ball from boys in a game of football , and encouraging boys to believe girls can play as well as they can			0
@entity87 , a psychologist in @entity88 , says the idea of boys being better than girls begins in childhood : " we 're talking about a country where the female infanticide rate is so high			1
that says that women are not wanted			2
then boys grow up with a sense of entitlement			0
" but why do men , or boys , go on to rape ? @entity87 says that although pinpointing the reasons are complicated : " @entity105 , as much as it 's about sex , is about power			1
and the only thing that separates rape from usual sex is consent			2
" he adds that the definition of what it means to be a man can be unclear to children : " i am gay and when i was growing up , i was always told to be a man , " says @entity87			0
" i just did n't understand what that meant ; does it mean abusing people ? " the reason why i became a psychologist is to understand myself , the culture , gender and sexuality			0
" @entity128 co-produces and directs @entity130 playwright @entity129 's @entity131 in @entity1 with his mother , @entity132			1
@entity130 woman allegedly gang - raped in @entity1 at first , it was banned in several cities			1
the play speaks candidly of female sexuality , including issues such as rape and genital mutilation --- a conversation , @entity128 says , @entity1 was n't ready to have			1
but the play is in its 11th year : " the audiences , right from the start , embraced the play , " says @entity132			0
he claims it were mainly theaters -- and sometimes women -- that opposed			2
" patriarchy knows no gender ; it 's a mindset , " says @entity132			2
" it 's an attitude towards women which many women themselves perpetrate			2
" although female goddesses and figures are revered in @entity158 , a dominating religion of the country , @entity132 argues : " the goddess model is very hard for anyone to emulate			2
" we 're saying if women fall short of being a goddess , we 'll violate them			2
in @entity166 , many virtuous women are only praised when in subservience to men			1
" @entity87 says a change in this culture will influence reforms in the legal system			2
however , some men are worried about what stricter anti-rape laws might mean for them			2
@entity177 's @entity176 formed an @entity50 in april to protect the region 's men or boys wrongfully accused of rape : " there are some women who are taking advantage of this law and misusing it , " says founder , @entity186			1
@entity187 , meaning the unity of men in the local language of @entity191 , will work alongside @entity193 's police to verify whether a complaint of sexual harassment or rape is genuine by speaking to people surrounding the case			1
if the accused is thought to be innocent , they will try to prevent his arrest			0
although @entity186 believes innocent men deserve protection , he admits the problem faced by women in @entity1 is in greater need of attention , and men need to take action			1
however , some believe that this is a battle for women only			0
" research shows [ women 's movements ] need autonomy and self determination , " says @entity213 , head of communications at the @entity215 ( @entity216 ) , the @entity217 umbrella body for women 's charities			0
" we have to decide what we want and how we want to achieve it			0
" it 's not dissimilar from the @entity229 which had to come from black people to progress it and have something of their own			0
" men ca n't live that reality [ of women 's oppression ]			1
" so what should men do ? @entity213 says : " men can listen , educate themselves and challenge sexist behavior whenever they observe it			0
" we [ @entity216 ] are all for men creating their own organizations , but they should be about challenging patriarchal views			0
" opinion : empowered women make nations strong some men are doing just that			2
on march 16 , men from different walks of life , from suited office workers to rugged @entity6 bikers , gathered in @entity255 -- a well - known protest area in @entity6 -- to apologize to women			1
holding posters with words such as : " @entity6 women : i 'm sorry , i 'm changing , " this was an alternative response to the rape crisis and the offense rate in the city , known as the crime capital of @entity1			1
recent figures from the @entity268 show that in 2012 , more women were raped in @entity6 -- 585 cases -- than in any other of @entity1 's largest cities			1
the so - called public apology was organized by @entity1 for @entity274 , a charity formed by a circle of male friends during the anti-corruption movement in 2011			1
they encourage personal responsibility and follow the slogan : " i am corrupt and change starts with me			0
" " this is n't our responsibility , what do you have to be sorry for ? it 's the girl 's fault , " was one such comment co-founder @entity287 received on the group 's @entity289 page , which has over 4,600 likes			0
" this is the debate we need to have , encouraging people to introspect			0
that 's the first step to change , " says @entity287 , echoing the philosophy of the @entity296 , leader of the @entity1 nationalist movement			1
@entity132 says that although the rape crisis in @entity1 can not be denied , this is a problem the world over , citing the @entity130 military as one example , where recent @entity305 estimates indicate a 37 % increase in sexual assaults to 26,000 cases last year			1
but @entity287 believes looking at the statistics of other countries is ignoring the fact that there 's a huge problem at home			0
nobody believes social overhauls happen overnight			0
@entity59 says change begins with educating today 's youth ; therefore it will take a generation before real transformation is seen			0
but the efforts of some of @entity1 's gentlemen provide hope that chivalry is alive in a country where a rape crisis is at odds with its image of spirituality and gentleness			1
but how can the message reach the real culprits ? @entity132 says : " the message has to constantly be out in the media , public , our discourse , education , corporate and political worlds			0
" it 's got to be this drone that you ca n't get away from			0
we all have to become the message			0
" anger , frustration over rapes in @entity1 : ' mindset has n't changed '			1

female *tourism* to @entity1 has dropped 35 % in three months after a high - *profile* rape
men in @entity1 are also trying to change mentality , holding protests and campaigns
@entity358 is a mindset women can have as well , says *advocate*
