-- several months ago , @entity1 and @entity2 were strolling through a shop near their home in @entity6 , @entity7 , when they spotted a box of high - powered magnets that could be arranged and rearranged into various shapes			1
" we said , ' these look neat			2
this would be something fun for us to do , ' " @entity1 recalls			0
so the couple bought the magnets			1
it ended up being the worst purchase of their lives			0
even though they say they put the magnets up on a high shelf , their son @entity26 , almost 2 years old , somehow swallowed eight of them			1
if they had been just little balls , it would n't have been much of a problem ; he would have just passed them			0
but because the magnets were attracted to one another , they formed a clump and bored a hole through his intestines			1
@entity26 has been in the hospital for nearly two months , most of that time spent in intensive care			0
he 's had more than six surgeries			1
he developed a bloodstream infection and had to be completely sedated for three weeks			0
more than once , doctors thought he would die			0
he 's scheduled to leave the hospital this week , but he still needs to have an intestinal transplant because much of the tissue had to be removed			1
there are no recent studies on how many children have ingested high - powered magnets , although the @entity54 has received reports of 200 cases since 2008			1
@entity54 animation shows how magnets twist the intestines one of @entity26 's physicians , dr. r. @entity61 , an associate professor of pediatrics at the @entity63 in @entity64 , surveyed his fellow pediatric gastroenterologists to get an idea of how often this occurs			1
the 33 physicians who responded to @entity61 's survey had altogether seen 82 young patients who had swallowed magnets			1
most of these kids , like @entity26 , had bowel perforations			0
tuesday , @entity61 and other pediatric gastroenterologists will meet in @entity76 with the @entity54 to ask what they can do to help make sure more children do n't suffer			1
" i 'm surprised by how little protection there is , " @entity61 says			0
product recalls , even bans , are ' on the table ' magnets have a long and not very happy history with the @entity54			1
in 2006 , the agency and @entity87 announced a voluntary recall of more than 4 million sets of @entity90 , plastic dolls whose clothes and accessories contained magnets			2
a spokesman for the @entity54 says the agency might do something similar with adult magnet toys			1
" we 're an agency with a history of a few bans , " says the spokesman , @entity100			2
" all options are still on the table			0
" companies that make magnetic " adult desktop toys , " such as @entity108 and @entity109 , argue that the products would be safe if consumers used them correctly			0
" you have to keep them up high , like scissors , or prescription drugs , " says @entity113 , a lawyer for the company that makes @entity108 , the leading adult magnet toy on the market			0
" you tell kids not to touch the stove			0
it 's no different with a product like @entity108			2
" there are five warnings on the packaging and instructions for @entity108 , he says , and the company wo n't sell them in stores that cater exclusively to children			0
plus , he says , they have an education program for stores , physicians and schools			0
but some doctors wonder if warnings and education are enough			0
if there are hundreds of magnets in each set , parents might not notice that a few roll away			2
since magnets are fun to play with and they look like candy , young children will likely try to eat them			2
" is there really any truly safe way of keeping these products out of the hands of children ? " asks dr. @entity150 , chief of the division of pediatric gastroenterology at @entity153 , who plans on attending the tuesday meeting in @entity76			1
' not your grandfather 's magnets ' @entity61 's presentation to the @entity54 is titled " not your @entity165 's magnets			1
" called " rare earth " or " neodynium " magnets , they 're much more powerful than their regular counterparts			1
dr. @entity171 , a professor of pediatrics at @entity173 in @entity174 , knows how strong these magnets ' attraction really is			1
he recently removed a bracelet made of 29 high - powered magnets from the stomach of a 13 - month - old girl			2
" it 's not easy to pull them apart , " he says			2
" you can feel the resistance			0
" since these magnets are more powerful , they 're more likely to clump together inside the body			1
" normally , who cares about little round balls ? but these are little round balls that can twist your intestines , " @entity190 says			2
the @entity197 , after their horrific experience with @entity26 , are all for a recall			0
" i would love to get them banned , " @entity1 says			0
" i do n't want this to happen to anyone else			0
" if you suspect your child has swallowed a magnet , please seek immediate medical attention .			1

magnets , if swallowed , can cause major problems in a child 's *digestive* *system*
@entity54 has received reports of 200 cases since 2008
strong magnets can clump together after they 're swallowed and *damage* intestines
pediatric gastroenterologists will meet in @entity76 with the @entity54 on tuesday
