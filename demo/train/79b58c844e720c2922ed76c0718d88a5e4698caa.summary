@entity0 -- with all the tributes to @entity4 , one thing tends to get forgotten : the man helped us write			1
@entity4 was the first to give us a real choice of fonts , and thus the ability to express ourselves digitally with emotion , clarity and variety			1
he made @entity13 of us all			2
@entity4 did n't invent typefaces , of course ; i think @entity17 may have had a stronger claim to that in @entity20 when he used his first carved letters in the 1440s			1
but @entity4 realized their value like no one else engaged in personal computers in the early 1980s , and suddenly we were no longer dependent on professional printers , graphic designers and those long dark nights of the soul with rub - down letters			1
and who did @entity4 himself thank for this advance ? he credited the people who made the cost of his academic life so expensive at @entity38 in @entity39 , @entity40			1
he said he dropped out to save his parents spending their entire life savings			2
and if he had n't dropped out , he may not have discovered calligraphy			0
" throughout the campus , " he remembered at an address to students at @entity46 in 2005 , ' " every poster , every label on every drawer , was beautifully hand calligraphied			0
" so , having dropped out and finding himself a free agent , he decided to take a class in this art. " i learned about serif and sans serif typefaces , about varying the amount of space between different letter combinations , about what makes great typography great			1
it was beautiful , historical , artistically subtle in a way that science ca n't capture , and i found it fascinating			0
" at the time , the student dropout believed that little he had learned would find a practical application in his life			0
ten years after college @entity4 designed his first @entity73 , and it came with something unprecedented -- a wide choice of fonts			1
originally he hoped to do this on the cheap , and by enlisting the designer @entity79 he created new bitmap designs that were available in a range of styles and sizes			0
the original thought was to name them after stops on a local @entity88 train route close to where @entity79 had grown up , but @entity4 then plumped for the more accessible notion of cities he loved : @entity0 , @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 , and @entity96			1
these names had the added advantage of reflecting the typographical character of the cities in question , so @entity0 had an old - fashioned serif " blackletter " feel that @entity102 might have favored , @entity94 had an artisanal script feel , and @entity92 had a cleaner @entity107 sans - serif look			0
for some reason yet to be fully justified , the @entity96 font appeared to be made up of odd letters torn from a newspaper , a digital ransom note			0
soon there would be more familiar names added to the mix , including @entity116 and @entity117			0
so this was the beginning of something -- a seismic shift in our everyday relationship with letters and with type			0
an innovation that , within a decade or so , would place the word " font " -- previously a piece of technical language limited to the design and printing trade -- in the vocabulary of every computer user			0
you ca n't easily find most of @entity4 's original typefaces these days , which may be just as well : they are coarsely pixilated and cumbersome to manipulate ( significantly , the typeface that @entity139 used in its early promotional advertisements -- remember ' @entity141 ' ? -- were in a modern version of good old @entity143 , a @entity145 style from the 16th century			1
) but the ability to change fonts on our computers seemed like technology from another planet			2
before the @entity153 , most primitive word processors offered up one dull face , often on a green screen , and good luck trying to italicize it			0
now there was a choice of alphabets that did their best to recreate something we were used to from the real world			2
@entity164 and @entity165 would soon do their best to copy @entity139 's lead , while domestic printers ( a novel concept at the time ) began to be marketed not only on speed but for the variety of their fonts			2
and here 's the thing			0
just as we celebrate the new iphone or the new @entity178 , let 's observe how primitive is our choice of fonts on these machines , and how far they have to go to catch up with the past			1
the @entity186 app on the phone has three choices , and one of them is ' " @entity191 " ; the @entity178 has a few more , but the choice is still in single figures			2
could it be that the one thing that @entity4 recognized almost 30 years ago -- the absolute pleasure of the shape of letters -- is being forgotten in a race for miniaturization , speed and the relentless pursuit of gadgetry newness ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity206 .			1

@entity206 : new iphone was introduced without @entity4
he says one of @entity4 ' great *accomplishments* was *popularization* of typefaces
suddenly *consumers* could express themselves through choice of fonts , he says
@entity206 : @entity4 has been an enduring tech *inspiration*
