@entity0 -- when presumptive @entity4 presidential nominee @entity3 appears before @entity6 small - business owners in @entity0 on wednesday , he 'll address a group whose explosive birth rates foreshadow a seismic political shift in @entity11 strongholds in the @entity12 and @entity13			1
" the @entity4 ' problem is their voters are white , aging and dying off , " said @entity14 , a senior research associate at the @entity15 , who studies minority political engagement			1
" there will come a time when they suffer catastrophic losses with the realization of the population changes			2
" over the next several generations , the wave of minority voters -- who , according to @entity31 @entity30 figures released this week , now represent more than half of the nation 's population born in the past year -- will become more of a power base in places like @entity38 , @entity39 and @entity40			1
that hold will extend across the @entity13 all the way to @entity44 , experts say			1
opinion : sorry @entity47 , minorities not looking for ' payback ' the coming political revolution could result in a massive changing of the guard on nearly every level of government , potential cultural clashes , and the type of political alliances that are now considered rare			2
offspring of immigrant farm workers in @entity40 , those rumblings are already being felt			2
it is a state that depends heavily on immigrant labor to pick peaches and peanuts and work in poultry plants			2
so when @entity40 -- like its @entity66 sister states of @entity38 , @entity67 , @entity39 , @entity68 and @entity69 -- passed a tough anti-immigration bill that also penalizes businesses , @entity73 groups and farmers alike pushed back			2
" this election cycle @entity79 in @entity40 are upset about ( the law ) , " said @entity75 , executive director of @entity76 , a nonprofit and nonpartisan group geared toward @entity40 's growing @entity6 population			2
" that 's going to spur more galvanization than we 've ever seen before			0
" according to the @entity89 , @entity85 states such as @entity38 , @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity39 , @entity88 , @entity69 and @entity68 boast some of the greatest percentage increases in @entity6 population growth			0
they are also states where the percentage of @entity6 roughly doubled			0
and , according to @entity89 , the @entity6 population boom helped @entity95 , @entity96 , @entity40 , @entity97 , @entity69 , @entity98 , @entity99 and @entity0 net additional congressional seats			0
though @entity40 's @entity6 population has mushroomed over the past ten years , according to @entity89 , roughly 23 % of that group is eligible to vote , compared to roughly 76.2 % of whites and just over 69 % of @entity104			1
still , activists like @entity75 are hopeful that lawmakers will see the trends and recognize " latinos merit a seat at the table as well			1
" so far , @entity4 efforts to offer @entity79 a place at the table have fallen short			1
the nation 's @entity6 tend to vote @entity115 , and overwhelmingly supported @entity116 and @entity117 in 2008			1
@entity3 in particular has stumbled with this critical voting bloc , after his comments suggesting that making the economic landscape tough for illegal immigrants will force them to " self deport			0
" trying to convince a growing population even @entity4 @entity73 lawmakers , such as sen. @entity125 , @entity96 , have urged the @entity11 to soften its language when discussing immigration and such proposals as the @entity130 - passed version of the @entity131 , which killed expanded coverage for illegal immigrants and native americans who are victims of domestic abuse , and the failed @entity136 , which would have given @entity31 residency to immigrant kids with high school diplomas			1
the @entity11 is trying to clean up its image with @entity73 voters , with an eye toward the demographic 's looming political clout			0
@entity3 is slated to speak at the @entity146 's @entity145 in @entity0 on wednesday			0
last week , his campaign released " @entity148 , " a spanish - language version of an ad underscoring @entity3 's mission for the first day he assumes the presidency			0
if @entity4 continue to struggle to appeal to @entity6 voters , @entity154 - language ads may not stave off a change that experts like @entity14 see coming in the not too distant future , when states such as @entity40 go purple and eventually blue			1
" there 'll be a tipping point where you 've got the @entity4 in charge , but you 'll get to the point when the population becomes minority , " @entity14 said			1
" when that happens the statewide offices will fall			0
" this announcement on birth rates " should be a wake - up call to everyone running for political office from this day forward , " said @entity171 , a veteran @entity11 strategist who has helped advise candidates since 1980			1
" @entity79 should no longer be considered minorities			0
in many crucial electoral states , this ' former minority ' is fast becoming the deciding vote			2
the candidate who reaches out most effectively will win their support			0
" " token efforts , such as tamale parties , will no longer work			0
winning will require more than outreach			0
it will require inclusion , " @entity171 said			0
" latinos , african - americans and people of other races must be represented in the important decision - making strategies of any given campaign , whether it be for a @entity198 or @entity4			1

births of *nonwhites* have now overtaken births of whites , according to the @entity31 census
@entity4 face *uphill* battle in *persuading* latinos to vote for their candidates
shift is most pronounced in the @entity12 and @entity13
