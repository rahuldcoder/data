an election - year showdown over a @entity2 priority -- raising the federal minimum wage to $ 10.10 an hour -- saw @entity5 @entity4 block the measure on wednesday , unleashing a torrent of criticism from president @entity9 and his party			1
the measure failed to get the 60 votes needed to open debate in the 100 - seat @entity5 , with only one @entity4 joining majority democrats in an unsuccessful effort to overcome the @entity4 filibuster			2
while another vote on the proposal is possible , @entity9 and @entity2 quickly sought to exploit the measure 's initial stumble into political capital for november 's congressional elections			1
" if your member of @entity28 does n't support raising the minimum wage , you have to let them know they are out of step and if they keep putting politics ahead of working @entity35 , you will put them out of office , " the president told a @entity24 event that focused on the matter			1
minimum wage state by state @entity4 argue raising the minimum wage to $ 10.10 per hour would damage the nation 's fragile economic recovery			1
several @entity4 lawmakers took note of fresh data released wednesday indicating the economy grew at a sluggish 0.1 % in the first quarter of 2014			0
" they seem to think they can coast on talking points and stale ideas â € ” and that the @entity35 people have n't been paying attention to their recent dismal record at actually helping the people they claim to care about , " said @entity48 leader @entity48 of @entity49			0
however , @entity58 argued the @entity4 position hurt @entity35 workers struggling to make ends meet			2
" their vote today defines their priorities , " sen. @entity62 of @entity63 said of @entity4			0
" it is the equivalent of looking @entity35 women in the eye and telling them they do n't deserve a living wage			0
it is telling our middle - class families they do n't deserve a fair shot			0
" minimum wage : @entity28 stalls , states act even if the @entity5 moved ahead with the legislation , there was little chance the @entity24 , which is led by @entity4 , would take it up			1
@entity9 and @entity2 noted that polls show a strong majority of @entity35 support raising the minimum wage , which currently stands at $ 7.25			1
at the same time , polls indicate @entity2 have little chance of winning back control of the @entity24 in november and could lose their majority in the @entity5			1
after wednesday 's vote , @entity2 senators sought to use the defeat as a rallying cry for november			2
" low - income people tend not to vote , but on this , this would be one that they come out on because it 's a pocketbook issue for them , " said liberal sen. @entity93 of @entity94			0
democrat @entity99 of @entity100 noted that traditionally conservative states like @entity102 and @entity103 have put a minimum - wage increase on their ballots " to help bring out the vote			2
" 2014 : what 's at stake @entity4 senators this week telegraphed their opposition to the minimum wage proposal , with some saying the @entity2 plan was too expensive and would lead to significant job losses if businesses were forced to adopt it			1
" it 's too high , too fast , " said sen. @entity116 of @entity117 , who favors a smaller increase like the one adopted in his state			0
sen. @entity121 , a @entity122 @entity48 , also said she supports a reasonable increase and complained that @entity2 sought to force the higher figure through without compromise or debate			0
" i think it speaks to what 's wrong with @entity63 today -- that we 're placed in a situation where it was ' take it or leave it ' rather than trying to come together and offer amendments and offer a level that might be acceptable , " @entity127 said after the vote			0
@entity93 , however , said the $ 10.10 figure sought by @entity2 was needed to lift people out of poverty			1
" we will not compromise on $ 10.10			2
that just gets us above the poverty level , " he said			0
" anyone who wants to go below that is saying that a hard - working @entity35 who works full - time all year long still will live in poverty			0
it 's time to get beyond that			0
" 2014 : the battle for the @entity5 in february , @entity9 signed an executive order raising the minimum wage to $ 10.10 per hour for federal contractors beginning in 2015			1
the measure voted on wednesday sought to make that figure the federal minimum wage			2
the lone @entity4 to vote with @entity2 was sen. @entity155 of @entity156 , who said he wants changes in the measure even though he supported bringing it up for debate			2
meanwhile , @entity2 sen. @entity161 , who is facing a challenging re-election in conservative @entity102 , supports a smaller increase that is under consideration in his state			0
@entity161 missed wednesday 's vote because he was back in @entity102 dealing with this week 's storm damage			0
key races to watch republicans argued the liberal agenda pushed by senate majority leader @entity171 of @entity172 could hurt centrist democrats this fall			0
" for the @entity2 here in the @entity5 , particularly the vulnerable ones who are in tough competitive races , they 've got to be particularly sensitive to the agenda the @entity2 are driving , " sen. @entity174 of @entity175 , a @entity4 leader , said this week			1
" i think there are a lot of @entity2 , on minimum wage even , that are concerned about its impact on the economy			1
" recent national polls indicated that a strong majority of @entity35 support raising the minimum wage to $ 10.10 per hour			1
the most recent survey , conducted early last month by @entity191 , put that support at 69 %			0
an @entity195 / @entity194 poll released tuesday indicated that by a 49 % -33 % margin , @entity35 say that the @entity2 is closer to their views on the issue than the @entity4			1
and by a two - to - one margin , voters nationwide questioned earlier this month in a @entity202 poll said they would be more likely than less likely to vote for a candidate who supports raising the minimum wage			1
meanwhile , national polls suggested @entity4 have an enthusiasm edge over @entity2 six months before the november vote			1
according to an @entity211 / @entity210 poll released wednesday , 45 % of registered voters say they want the november elections to result in a @entity4 - controlled @entity28 , with an equal amount saying they 'd like to see @entity2 in control on @entity216			1
but among voters with the highest interest in the midterms , the @entity4 holds a 15 - percentage point lead ( 53 % -38 % ) over the @entity2 on the question of which party should control @entity28			1
a @entity224 poll conducted late last month showed that 75 % of registered @entity4 voters questioned said they were very or somewhat excited about voting in november , compared to 58 % of @entity2			2
also , 81 % of registered @entity4 said they 'll definitely vote in november , compared to 68 % of registered @entity2			1
the surveys seem to back up the conventional wisdom that the @entity4 has an advantage over the @entity2 in midterm contests			2
white voters and older voters , key to the @entity4 base , tend to cast ballots in bigger percentages in midterms than younger voters and minorities , who are an important part of the @entity2 ' base			0
democrats hold a 55 - 45 majority in the @entity5 , including two independents who caucus with the party , but are defending 21 of the 36 seats contested in november			0
half of those @entity2 - held seats are in traditionally conservative states or those considered purple -- leaning neither right or left			0
in the @entity24 , @entity2 need to pick up 17 @entity4 - held seats to win back control of the @entity4 - led chamber , a feat political handicappers say is unlikely considering the shrinking number of competitive congressional districts			2
leading dem gov : 2014 is not a ' change ' election new low for @entity9 in key midterm indicator @entity262 goes on offense over @entity4 economic agenda special coverage : the 2014 midterms			0
