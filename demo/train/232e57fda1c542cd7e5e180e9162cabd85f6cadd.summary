-- @entity1 gets slammed for charging fees for almost everything except the air we breathe			1
( although that fee could be coming soon			0
) the airline revels in its reputation as a super-low - cost carrier willing to take its lumps , so much that it launched an air travel state of hate survey over the summer to share the hate air travelers feel about airlines as a whole			1
almost 30,000 travelers filled out the survey in just a few days , in exchange for 8,000 spirit reward miles			2
it turns out that travelers ' hate was n't only directed at spirit , according to the airline 's own survey			1
passengers are mad at most @entity28 airlines			0
" i think if any organization asks for feedback , you would expect the vast majority of responses would be directed at the company that seeks it , " @entity29 , @entity1 's president and ceo , said in a statement			1
" but in this case , we were surprised that most consumers chose to share their frustrations about other airlines			0

fees came in fifth place ( 12 % )			0
@entity1 does n't get most of the blame in its own survey			0

" @entity1 mess up , and air travelers get frustrated , " @entity29 said			2
" the feedback we received makes it clear no airline is immune from upsetting their customers , and at spirit , we can do a better job of explaining how flying with us is different			0
" spirit 's cheerful defense : pay for what you want on your flight , and do n't pay for what you do n't want			0
the airline 's new this is @entity86 campaign shares the details of how to reduce those fees , including paying for checked luggage from home and printing your boarding pass at home			2

about 28 % of travelers from the @entity96 report major levels of dissatisfaction with their travel experiences , compared with a global average of 22 %			0
but really , it 's about spirit it 's a good effort by @entity1 to lump complaints about its fees into the conversation about @entity28 ' growing resentment of most @entity28 airlines			1
but really , most customers blame spirit by a wide margin			0
