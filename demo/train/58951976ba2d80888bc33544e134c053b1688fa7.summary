@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 sits inside her sweltering tent looking at pictures of the children she will never see again			1
all six died the night of november 8 , along with their father and their grandmother			2
@entity3 now lives alone near her own father in the @entity1 city of @entity0 , still trying to come to terms with her appalling loss			1
they died as they tried to shelter from @entity17 inside their wood and tin shack			2
@entity3 somehow survived the wall of water that swept away her family and her future			2
she is one of 100,000 people , according to the @entity26 , who now live in tents throughout the region of the central @entity1 devastated by one of the strongest storms ever recorded			1
a staggering one million live in conditions considered by the @entity26 to be unsafe and vulnerable to future storms			1
" i want to leave but i ca n't , " she says			0
" there 's nowhere for me to go and i am at the bottom of the list for a new house			2
" the tragic reality for @entity39 is that she is a low priority for a new home because she does n't have children			0
the best she hopes for now is to go back to school , get a qualification and try to start a new life somewhere else			0
seven months after @entity17 , the city of @entity0 still bares the vivid scars of its destructive path			1
the airport is still only partially rebuilt , while much of the city is a mix of mangled steel structures , concrete shells that used to be houses , roadside graveyards , tents and crowded temporary homes known as " bunkhouses "			1
the @entity60 vehicles of aid organizations can been seen everywhere			0
but @entity0 is not sinking in despair			1
power is mostly restored , the town center once again throbs with business and noise , both the @entity69 and @entity70 plants are back in operation and the hotels are open			0
" i love @entity0 " signs are springing up , or are being repainted			1
at the @entity76 a sheet hangs from the roof with the words " @entity79 " ( " @entity80 " )			0
the city is not yet standing tall but it 's trying			1
the biggest single problem is housing			0
the storm surge destroyed thousands of homes on the coastal strip			2
with nowhere else to go , people are rebuilding over the remains of their old houses , using whatever they can scavenge from the wreckage			1
new timber is in short supply			0
however they are building exactly where the government does n't want them to , right in the danger zone			2
anything like a repeat of the 8 meters - high wall of water that crashed through the coastal strip would once again wash away these homes			1
read more : returning to a city still struggling , but determined the government initially banned any new building within 40 meters of the sea but that was modified because it was impractical			2
there are no hard rules about where to rebuild but it is clear that the government sees these new rebuilt homes as temporary			1
" it is too dangerous to build back there			0
it is too exposed , " says @entity118 , @entity119			0
" @entity17 ( the local name of @entity17 ) is the new normal as far as we are concerned			0
we have to build places that can stand up to that sort of weather , " he says			0
the government is planning to build 200,000 new homes to house a million people			1
they will be away from the shoreline on land not prone to mudslides and solid enough to withstand the most extreme winds ( @entity17 's sustained wind speed was measured at around 199mph / 320kmph )			2
" we have the money for it , " says @entity118			0
but progress has been glacially slow , say the people of @entity0			1
the master recovery plan has only just been tabled			0
politics , bureaucracy , finding and acquiring suitable land have all contributed to the fact that of the 200,000 homes planned , only about 130 had been completed by the middle of may			1
" @entity150 " is the government 's slogan but that is wearing thin on the streets here			1
for people like @entity39 , the slogans mean nothing			2
" we 've been waiting a long time			0
i do n't know how long my suffering will go on , " she says			0
" who do i run to , who do i lean on ? i do n't have a family , no husband to rely on			0
" the government says it understands and it 's ramping up re-development			2
but now it is a race against time			0
at the beginning of june the new typhoon season began			1
and @entity0 and the surrounding area is one of the most typhoon - prone parts of the planet			1
gallery : after @entity17 and six months later			0

around 100,000 people in the typhoon devastated region of the @entity1 live in tents
the city of @entity0 is slowly rebuilding with government plans for 200,000 homes for 1 million *residents*
many complain that *reconstruction* is too slow and homes are being rebuilt on at - risk areas
" @entity189 " is the city 's new slogan but the region is *bracing* itself for the new typhoon season
