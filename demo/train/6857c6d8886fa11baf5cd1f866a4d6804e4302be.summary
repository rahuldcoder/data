-- the game just changed			2
and @entity2 just changed it			1
the music industry has a track record knowing how to market the extremely prolific , gifted , inspiring , highly - credited icons			1
they 've done it for years			2
there 's a formula : put out a single on the radio first , then blanket the market with promotion , then schedule a big release party			1
sure , there are the legends who have created their own vine , their sonic signature sound , their own untraceable music landscapes -- the @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 and the " @entity26 , " @entity27			2
for those icons , the rules -- and techniques -- are a bit different			0
but none of them tried what mrs. @entity34 just pulled off			0
when @entity2 surprised the entire music industry this month by releasing her latest album , " @entity2 , " only on @entity38 first -- with no warning , no other promotion , no launch parties , no advance radio play , none of the traditional pre-sale retail hype -- she showed how only a true star can break this industry glass ceiling			1
when it comes to business savvy , she just joined the lists of the greats			0

it was a smart and honest way to let the fans decide for themselves if they wanted the lp without major promotion and publicity			0
and , by announcing it first on @entity66 to her millions of followers , it was a masterful nod to her true , loyal fans -- and they have responded in kind			0
no one in the music industry could have pulled this off except @entity2			1
her global fans follow her 24/7 online , on the air and on social media			0
and , like @entity27 , her stardom keeps fans anticipating her next song , her next dance move , her next fashion statement and her next signature on the dotted line			0
and she reset the retail music business , too			2
it did n't matter if retailers like @entity89 -- who just announced their plans -- decided not to sell the lp that hit retail outlets friday because it was released on @entity38 first			0
other outlets , such as @entity94 ( where @entity2 made a surprise appearance ) , have stepped up and will sell out before they can order their next shipment			1
@entity89 's loss , @entity94 's gain			0
related : @entity2 's surprise album : what 's the verdict ? @entity2 is unique			1
she has shown that she is not afraid to try new things to reach greater heights , to change the game			1
