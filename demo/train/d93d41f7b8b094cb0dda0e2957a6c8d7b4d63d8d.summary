-- during his trip to northwest @entity4 in late april , @entity1 talked to dozens of people who told him gut - wrenching stories			1
when the @entity11 interviewer and his colleagues returned home , they titled their report " they burned my heart : war crimes in @entity18 during peace plan negotiations			1
" " those words were chosen because what we saw and heard evidence of were systematic executions and torture -- war crimes -- by the @entity4 government forces , " he said			1
" it 's been frustrating to record these stories and then hear more negotiating , " said @entity1 , who describes in a video what he saw			1
" i think it 's clear that there are attempts to undermine the peace plan			1
" this week , a bomb exploded near a @entity40 convoy of workers tasked with monitoring whether a peace plan is working			0
on thursday , two car bombs also exploded outside a key government intelligence compound in @entity45			0
for much of the 14 - month uprising , the capital city , home to many @entity50 supporters , has been largely untouched by the violence			0
thursday 's explosions , which killed more than 50 people , are believed to mark a major point in the conflict			1
more violence came friday , according to an opposition group			2
five people in @entity59 and @entity60 were killed by government forces : three were shot by snipers , and two were tortured to death , a spokesperson said			2
the architect of the peace plan , @entity66 , the @entity40 special envoy to @entity4 , has said that he is now weighing an invitation to meet with @entity50			1
@entity71 's government faults " terrorists , " the term it uses to describe the opposition and rationalize security forces ' crackdown			2
his regime has banned foreign journalists , and several of those who 've attempted to report on what 's happening in @entity4 have been injured or killed			1
@entity1 and his team knew the risk they took in entering @entity4			1
they avoided checkpoints and kept a low profile			0
they visited homes in the province of @entity18 and say they hundreds of ruined homes in various towns , many probably from systemic house - by - house arson attacks			0
many of the male opposition fighters who once lived in the area 's towns have fled , @entity1 said			2
many women , children and the elderly remain , yet they are being targeted with equal brutality , he said			0
several of the 65 witnesses and victims who talked to @entity11 were mothers or wives			1
they say government forces broke into their homes and executed their families			1
three of the victims were children			2
at 33 , @entity1 is already an experienced conflict documentarian , interviewing victims of violence in @entity116 , the @entity118 and @entity117			2
he has focused on @entity4 since the @entity121 movement exploded in march 2011			1
but still , he can not get one mother out of his head			0
" she was telling me how the government forces had detained her son and how she had tried to be nice and quiet and cooperative , hoping they would release him , " @entity1 said			2
" but as soon as the soldiers left , they told her , ' you have to forget your son			2
' " three days later , the woman found her son 's body , riddled with signs of torture , in a village cemetery			1
" the courage she had despite ( what she went through ) and the way she described how she found his body afterward , that made quite a great impact on me , " he said			2
@entity1 says another mother suffered similarly			0
the woman recalled how her three sons -- all in their early 20s -- were awakened in the middle of the night by fighters in uniform who identified themselves as " @entity152 's men			1
" the fighters demanded to know why the sons owned a pants of a style seen worn at demonstrations			0
the mother desperately tried to explain that the pants were common , that they were the only style available at the town market			0
the fighters , she said , ransacked the house and forced the sons outside			0
the mother ran after them , but the " soldiers pushed me back inside , " she said			0
she describes what happened : " about an hour later , a neighbor came in and said there was a fire nearby , that the army set some cars and a motorcycle on fire , and the neighbors needed more water			0
my daughters and i went out with buckets , and then my daughters , who were in front , ran to me , saying that my sons were there as well			0
" after we extinguished the fire , we found their bodies			0
@entity183 was shot in the middle of his forehead , @entity186 behind his ear , and @entity188 was shot by two bullets , in the head and in the back			0
" the mother told @entity11 , " i just wish i were killed and i did n't have to see that			1
" several of the victims of summary executions were teenagers ; three were children , and several were older than 60 , the group documented			1
though @entity1 has interviewed victims in numerous conflicts , @entity4 stands out to him because of the estimated tens of thousands of people who rights workers suspect have been unlawfully detained			1
" but it 's really unclear how many			2
no one really knows for sure , " he said			0
also unusual is what he says is @entity4 authorities ' widespread , systematic use of certain torture techniques : electricity is often used			1
@entity4 have also come up with a name for being hogtied ; they call it the " flying carpet			1
" @entity1 was also struck by people who victims described accompanying their attackers			0
these people often wear masks and may be locals or people familiar with the victims			0
one man recalled to @entity11 that while a @entity4 official brutalized him , a man with his attacker spouted personal information about him			1
" ask him about his cousin who happens to be a lawyer who is active with the opposition , " the man said			0
another section of the report details the execution of 19 boys and men in the village of @entity240 on april 3			0
@entity11 was able to observe bullet marks near several of the alleged killings : all in a row , about 50 to 60 centimeters above the floor , indicating that the victims were probably kneeling when they were shot			1
less than a week earlier , in late march , @entity50 announced that he would implement the @entity40 peace plan .			0

@entity11 interviewed @entity4 who said families had been executed
one woman talked about finding her son 's body , tortured , in a cemetery
the group interviewed 65 witnesses and victims in late april
@entity259 said what he heard and saw constitutes war crimes
