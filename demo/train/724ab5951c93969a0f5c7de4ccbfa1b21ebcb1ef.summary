@entity0 , @entity1 -- the hosting of the @entity4 by @entity1 was always going to be an occasion for celebration among football lovers around the world , but for former soccer greats who call the continent home , the event has a significance beyond mere fandom			1
having moved from a period where only four @entity1 sides qualified for the @entity18 in 44 years since the first event in 1930 , the continent now boasts some of the greatest stars in global soccer			1
superstars like @entity23 ( @entity24 ) , @entity25 ( @entity26 ) and @entity27 ( @entity28 ) may have global fame and great riches thanks to their talent , but for every modern legend from @entity1 there are just as many pioneers who helped break down the barriers to allow such opportunity			1
former players such as @entity38 ( @entity39 ) , @entity40 ( @entity26 ) and @entity41 ( @entity42 ) may not be household names that roll off the tongue , but they all played a crucial role in breaking down the prejudice that existed , and hampered , the abilities of players from @entity1			2
one such pioneer was @entity51 great @entity50 -- a skilful attacker who help guide the @entity52 to olympic gold glory in 1996 -- told @entity2 he believes that the @entity18 proves @entity1 football has finally come of age			1
" i think we have contributed a lot to world football and we are glad that @entity65 have finally recognized and believe that we belong , " said the 36 - year - old , who played in the top leagues in @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 and @entity61 before retiring in 2008			1
" it 's not just a game for us , it 's like a religion , it 's like a tradition			0
we bring a lot of colors , we bring a lot of emotion and we bring a lot of enthusiasm to the game			0
" 2010 @entity18 : a catalyst for a new @entity1 ? another great who did much to break down the barriers holding back footballers from @entity1 was @entity82			1
the @entity1 former striker played during the apartheid era and significantly was one of the first black players to take part in the previously illegal activity of cross-color matches in the 1970s			2
@entity90 was @entity1 's youngest - ever professional and easily one of the country 's greatest football talents			1
but despite playing for the @entity94 and the @entity95 alongside @entity96 and @entity40 , he was unable to play in world competition due to the international ban that existed on the racist @entity1 government			2
for @entity90 , hosting the @entity18 is bitter sweet : " it 's difficult to describe , it 's difficult being an ex-player who never got to play			0
i feel like i could turn the clock back and play now			0
but everything happens for a reason , " he told @entity2			0
@entity90 controversially sacrificed a lucrative career in @entity108 to return to apartheid @entity1 in an attempt to help the country to change			2
" they needed role models , they needed people who made it in spite of the regime , so ( they ) knew they could do it too			0
was it a sacrifice ? @entity121 spent 27 years in prison			0
me , i played football , " @entity90 said in an interview for @entity128 's " @entity127 " book			2
no @entity1 side has ever progressed past the quarterfinals of the @entity18 , so many hopes rests on hosts " @entity133 " to perform well			1
as a former technical director for the side @entity134 had some words of advise for his former students : " i know how the players are feeling			0
i 'll be speaking to them the day before the games			0
they will call me at night and i 'll say go out there and enjoy yourselves and do n't put pressure on yourselves , " he told @entity2			0
@entity149 , a member of the executive committees of football 's world governing body @entity65 and the @entity154 ( @entity154 ) , said whatever the progress of @entity1 , new standards are being set			1
" @entity1 football has reached the stage where it 's compared favorably with football in any part if the world , " he told @entity2			1
" if you look at @entity1 players , they are all around the world and they are very outstanding players			2
i 'm very proud that @entity1 football has got to that level			1
" @entity149 also attacked critics who have said that the cost of @entity1 hosting the @entity18 is too high , and instead claimed the tournament will leave a lasting legacy for the country			1
" people complain that it 's a waste of money , but it 's important that the organizers and the countries know that the benefits are very enormous , " he said			0
" no country hosts the @entity18 and remains the same			0
hosting these games brings a lot of financial social and economic benefits to the nation			0
