@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 's last physician , dr. @entity3 , was n't the one who gave the pop star a fatal overdose of propofol , according to @entity3 's attorney , hinting at the defense strategy in the involuntary manslaughter case against his client			1
" the fact ( of the way ) that he died was a mystery a year ago , and still is , " @entity0 attorney @entity14 told @entity2 in an exclusive interview recently			0
the @entity22 coroner ruled that @entity4 's june 25 , 2009 , death was from an overdose of propofol , a powerful anesthesia used to put surgical patients to sleep			1
@entity3 is charged with involuntary manslaughter in @entity4 's death			1
his preliminary hearing is expected this fall			0
@entity3 , hired as @entity4 's personal doctor while he rehearsed for his comeback concerts , admits he was giving @entity4 propofol as a sleep aid , but @entity35 said the amount was much smaller than what was found in @entity4 's body during the autopsy			1
the toxicology results included in the autopsy report said the propofol level was equal to what would be used to sedate a patient for major surgery			1
" there is no way that dr. @entity3 pumped @entity4 full of propofol sufficient for major surgery , " @entity35 said			1
i would stake anything that i own on this fact			0
" theories of how @entity4 might have gotten the fatal dose , other than from @entity3 , include someone else entering the upstairs bedroom and administering it -- or @entity4 waking up and giving it to himself			1
a anesthesia expert hired by the coroner addressed the possibility that @entity4 may have accidentally killed himself with propofol			2
" it would have been difficult for the patient to administer the drugs to himself , given the configuration of the iv set - up , " the expert wrote in the autopsy report			2
@entity35 said the possibility was not completely ruled out by the expert			0
" the coroner 's report deemed it to be unlikely , because it would be difficult , so i 'm assuming they 've addressed that situation and that 's what they believe , but is it possible ? absolutely , it 's possible , " @entity35 said			2
@entity4 's personal doctor @entity35 said @entity3 had no idea what he was getting into when he signed on as @entity4 's personal physician			1
@entity3 was reluctant to accept the job despite the $ 150,000 monthly salary , @entity35 said			0
" he was leaving two practices , one in @entity0 and one in @entity90 , " @entity35 said			0
" he was going to be giving up those practices that he built up over 20 years , with no guarantee that when he was done with @entity4 he would have his practices back			0
" @entity3 knew @entity4 had trouble sleeping , but did not know he was using propofol as a sleep aid , @entity35 said			1
" did dr. @entity3 know that ' when i get onboard treating @entity4 that i 'm going to have to deal with this drug propofol ? ' no , " @entity35 said			1
@entity35 said @entity3 was trying to wean @entity4 off an addiction to propofol			1
" he wanted to help him do that , " @entity35 said			0
" who else is addicted to a drug like propofol ? " the anesthesia expert consulted in the autopsy report said propofol was intended for use only in a surgical setting			2
but @entity35 defended @entity3 's usage of the drug in a residential setting			2
" the fact that medicines may have been prescribed or administered at home -- that alone does n't make it egregious , " he said			0
" a hospital is just four walls			0
i ca n't say he was in over his head , but he certainly was intending to try to help @entity4 get off that drug			0
" the hours before @entity4 died @entity3 told investigators that he tried for nine hours to get @entity4 to sleep the day he died , starting at 1:30 a.m. by 10:40 a.m. , after giving @entity4 several other sleep aids , @entity3 said he gave @entity4 25 milligrams of propofol through an intravenous tube attached to @entity4 's leg			1
the doctor 's whereabouts during the 90 minutes leading up to when @entity4 was found unresponsive are unclear			2
phone records show @entity3 made three calls totaling 47 minutes during that time			0
@entity3 told investigators he left @entity4 's side for " two minutes maximum " while he went to use the bathroom , according to a police affidavit filed in the case			1
the timing is important because it 's the only window when someone else , including @entity4 , could have administered the fatal dose of propofol			2
prosecutors said the evidence points toward @entity3 as the only person responsible for @entity4 's death			1
@entity35 said he 's confident that a jury will see it differently			0
" we get a fair jury and we are able to afford just some of the necessary experts and investigators then , yes , the doctor is going to win , " he said			0
" whatever the doctor did for @entity4 , whatever he did , was to help , and he took the necessary precautions and then something happened that is unexplainable , " @entity35 said .			0
