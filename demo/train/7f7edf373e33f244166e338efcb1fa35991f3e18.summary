editor 's note : @entity2 , a @entity3 strategist and @entity5 political contributor , was a political consultant for @entity7 's presidential campaign in 1992 and was counselor to @entity7 in the @entity9			1
@entity2 says @entity10 is a skillful politician and part of a new generation of rising women leaders			1
( @entity5 ) -- the big news in @entity16 politics is not that @entity17 , a deeply private person , preferred to be in private life			0
rather , the big news -- and for @entity3 , the good news -- is that gov. @entity21 has put another crack in the glass ceiling by appointing @entity10 to the @entity24			1
she moves with equal ease among @entity28 high - rollers and @entity30 dairymen			0
she knocked off an entrenched @entity32 congressman in a conservative district			1
when she began , no one but she and then - @entity36 chairman @entity35 thought she could win			0
when he was recruiting her for the congressional race , @entity35 told me @entity10 was someone special			1
i paid attention because i recalled the time , a decade or so ago , when @entity35 told me a skinny state senator named @entity43 was the future of the @entity3			1
since then i 've seen @entity10 in action			2
my father has a small farm in her district , near the village of @entity50 , @entity16			0
every summer i bring my boys to @entity50 to fish in a pristine mountain trout pond , and at night we feast on fresh - caught fish with my dad 's neighbors			0
those farmers and schoolteachers see @entity10 as one of their own ; someone who shares their values , who respects and protects the rugged beauty of their mountains even as she fights to bring jobs to the region			1
in short , @entity10 is the kind of @entity68 who can win in blood - red upstate @entity16			1
her membership on both the @entity72 and the @entity73 has allowed her to become an expert in policy areas some @entity3 shy away from			2
i 've also seen @entity10 in the big city			2
gov. @entity21 spoke at a @entity10 fundraiser i attended in a posh penthouse apartment overlooking @entity79			2
@entity10 had given birth to her son @entity81 a few weeks before			2
where she got the energy and the enthusiasm i 'll never know			0
even veteran @entity85 came away impressed			0
listening to @entity10 speak of how @entity86 inspired her , i could n't help but see parallels to @entity43			2
our new president has described himself as part of the @entity91 -- the @entity93 leaders who have come after pioneers like @entity95 , rev. @entity96 and dr. @entity97 perhaps @entity10 is part of the @entity91 of women leaders , inspired by @entity86 , @entity100 and so many others who blazed the trail @entity10 is now following			1
watching the jubilation of the @entity43 inauguration , some feminist friends worried aloud when a woman might break through the way president @entity43 has			0
" i 'm still not able to tell my daughter that she can be president , " one friend said			0
my own strong belief is we will see a woman president sooner than most suspect			1
and perhaps she will come from the ranks of the female @entity117			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			0

@entity2 : @entity10 is a @entity3 star in @entity32 upstate area
upstate residents say @entity10 shares their values , protects region , @entity2 says
@entity127 : @entity10 is part of the next generation of women political comers
he says he thinks we 'll see a woman president sooner than many suspect
