@entity20 , @entity21 : what 's in a name ? we 're to find out the answer for one couple in today 's edition of @entity0			1
from the @entity29 in @entity30 , i 'm @entity31			2
first up : @entity32 @entity33 : @entity32			2
the country is a partner with the @entity11 in the @entity36			1
it 's also dealing with terrorist attacks inside its own borders			2
that point made clear in yet another violent assault yesterday			1
government officials say an explosion in the country 's @entity45 , that 's in the northern part of @entity32 , killed at least 40 people and wounded at least 45 more			2
the blast took place at a security checkpoint			2
authorities say the target was a military vehicle			2
@entity56 forces took control of the @entity45 earlier this year , leading to a number of intense clashes with the @entity32 military			2
monday 's attack was the latest in a string of violence in the country , including a 22 - hour standoff over the weekend when militants took hostages at an army base			1
health care debate @entity33 : back here in the @entity11 , everyone watching the debate over health care reform has their attention focused on the @entity77 today			1
that is because the group is voting on a health care bill			2
this is the last committee vote before the issue moves to the @entity83 and @entity77			2
the bill that the @entity77 is considering is referred to as the @entity85 , named for sen. @entity86 , who heads up the committee			2
it 's a 10 - year plan that would cost the government $ 829 billion			1
but a new report says that @entity11 families would have to pay a hefty price as well			1
@entity93 says under the @entity94 , the amount that families pay for health care would go up 111 percent by 2019			2
the group says that under the current system , costs would go up 79 percent			2
a @entity100 spokesman says the report is inaccurate and self - serving			1
he points out that it was created by the insurance industry , which he calls one of the biggest opponents of health insurance reform			2
is this legit ? @entity108 , @entity21 : is this legit ? there is a @entity110 for economics			2
legit ! the award for economics was created in 1968 , adding to the existing @entity110 for physics , chemistry , medicine , literature and peace			2
@entity2 @entity33 : in the 40 years since the @entity2 was established , the winners had all been men			2
that changed yesterday , when @entity123 was named one of the recipients of this year 's award			2
the other winner is @entity128			0
they 're both experts in how the economy and businesses are regulated			0
@entity123 told reporters that when she first decided to pursue a post graduate degree , she was told that no major university would even think of hiring a woman			0
she 's proof times have changed			0
@entity137 @entity123 , nobel economics prize laureate : i think we 're entering a new , we 've already entered , a new era , and we recognize that women have the capabilities of doing great scientific work			0
and yes , i appreciate that this is an honor to be the first woman , but i wo n't be the last			0
@entity147 ? @entity33 : sticking with financial news , more than 80 percent of the country 's top economists believe the recession is over			0
that 's based on a survey done by the @entity154			0
however , most economists think it could take months before there 's any kind of serious improvement in terms of the housing market or job losses			0
the unemployment rate is expected to hit 10 percent between now and the end of the year , and to stay at that level through the first three months of 2010			0
@entity6 @entity33 : and looking overseas , that is where you 'll find secretary of state @entity169			1
she 's on a six - day trip to parts of @entity172 and @entity173 , addressing issues like arms control , health care and some long - running conflicts			1
@entity178 checks in from a stop in the @entity10 , where @entity7 was focused on the relationship between the @entity11 and one of its closest allies			1
( begin video ) @entity178 , @entity0 @entity184 , @entity185 were the handshakes with the foreign secretary a little firmer ? the smiles broader ? the hugs and kisses with the prime minister warmer than usual ? it seemed that way , as @entity169 put @entity11 and @entity195 's " special relationship " on display			1
@entity11 secretary of state hillary clinton : it is a special relationship			1
i have a special , personal relationship with the prime minister , and of course i think it ca n't be said often enough we have a special relationship between our countries			1
@entity206 : her mission : calm concerns in @entity210 that the @entity213 administration 's relationship with the government of prime minister @entity215 may be cooling			1
but on a range of international issues , there 's no daylight between the two countries			0
@entity222 : decisions about the future of @entity225 are up to the @entity225 people			0
but we will continue to speak out on behalf of human rights , on behalf of democracy , on behalf of freedom of expression , @entity232 , @entity10 foreign minister : our insistence that it is not for us to choose the government of @entity225 is clear			1
but also , our insistence that it is right to stand up for human rights around the world , for universal values , is also very clear			0
@entity206 : at @entity7 's next stops here in @entity243 and then in @entity244 , she highlighted another aspect of the special relationship : the @entity248 peace process			1
@entity222 : many people who are despairing over the prospects of peace look to @entity248			0
they think to themselves that if it could be done there , then perhaps we too have a chance to try to cross that border between conflict and peace and chart a different future for ourselves and our children			0
( @entity262 ) @entity263 @entity264 , @entity21 : time for the shoutout ! what is the world 's most popular sport ? if you think you know it , shout it out ! is it : a ) @entity276 , b ) soccer , c ) basketball or @entity277 ) cricket ? you 've got three seconds -- go ! the most popular sport in the world is soccer			1
@entity281 n't that a kick ! that 's your answer and that 's your shoutout ! @entity12 2010 @entity33 : and next june , the soccer world will be focused on @entity12 when that country hosts the @entity289			1
imagine if the @entity290 included teams from around the world and only happened once every four years			0
that gives you an idea of how huge the @entity289 is			0
@entity295 shows us how @entity12 is preparing for the soccer spotlight			1
( begin video ) @entity299 , @entity0 correspondent : watered and protected from the hot @entity12 sun , these are the first green shoots growing on the pitch where the opening game of the @entity289 will kick off in june next year			1
stadiums across the country will be ready by early next year , say @entity308 officials , who with clipboards in hand , have just inspected of all the match venues			0
so , while all of these stadiums are on track to be completed ahead of time , despite workers downing tools and going on strike a few months ago , there still is a lot more work to be done to ensure @entity308 is satisfied			1
@entity322 , @entity308 president : for the time being , let us be with 7.5			1
@entity326 : that 's the score @entity308 president @entity322 gave @entity12 for the @entity328 played here in july , and which was seen as a test case for the @entity12			1
@entity308 and @entity12 are all too aware of where the problems were and where they remain			1
@entity334 , local organizing committee : the areas we have been focusing on are accommodation , transportation and security			0
those were the three key areas			0
@entity326 : the organizing committee here concedes if there are big matches at small town stadiums , like this one in @entity347 , there simply will not be enough places for fans to sleep			0
@entity351 : some of the host cities wo n't have sufficient beds , and therefore it means that we 'll have to go outside those host cities			0
@entity326 : also , transport remains a headache			0
the system is haphazard , irregular and often unsafe			0
a new bus transit system in @entity361 has started running , but its routes are limited			0
other towns have little or no organized transport systems			0
getting from host city to host city , most fans will have to rely on @entity12 's well - developed air network			1
the @entity361 airport will be open 24 hours , and much has been spent on upgrading its facilities , including managing and protecting the estimated 40,000 pieces of luggage expected through here a day			0
@entity375 , transport minister : if we had @entity289 in december , we would be already on top of the situation			0
@entity326 : police say they will also be ready to protect 500,000 fans traveling here next year			0
@entity295 , @entity0 , @entity361 , @entity12			1
( @entity383 ) before we go @entity33 : before we go , if you love your name so much , why do n't you marry it ? ok ! we 'd like to introduce you to @entity387 and her fiance , @entity388			0
the couple met online when @entity388 -- the female @entity388 -- searched for her own name , and @entity388 -- the male @entity388 -- was the only person who came up			0
coincidence led to courtship , and now the two are getting married			0
call it fate , call it karma ... goodbye @entity33 : ... or if you want to confuse them , just call the house and ask for @entity388			0
that 's the best we 've got			0
commercial - free news is the name of the game , and we 'll be back with more tomorrow			1
