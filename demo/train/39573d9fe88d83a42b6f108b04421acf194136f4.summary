the @entity1 @entity0 is being asked to stop the @entity3 's surveillance of domestic telephone communications data			1
in an emergency appeal filed monday , a privacy rights group claimed a secret federal court improperly authorized the government to collect the electronic records , and said only the justices could resolve the statutory issues at stake			1
the @entity13 filed its petition directly with the high court , bypassing the usual step of going to the lower federal courts first			1
such a move makes it much harder for the justices to intervene now , but the privacy group argues " exceptional ramifications " demand judicial review now			1
published reports linked to @entity23 , who has admitted leaking classified national security information , indicated the @entity3 received secret court approval to collect vast amounts of so - called metadata from telecom giant @entity28 and leading @entity30 companies , including @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity35			1
the revelations have triggered new debate about national security and privacy interests , and about the secretive legal process that sets in motion government surveillance			1
the once - secret approval came in april from a judge at the @entity44 , which handles individual requests for electronic surveillance for " foreign intelligence purposes			1
" @entity28 turned over the metadata to the government			0
" telephone records , even without the content of the calls , can reveal an immense amount of sensitive , private information			2
there are no reasonable grounds for the @entity3 to have access to every call record of every @entity28 customer , " said @entity55 , president of the privacy information group			1
he added that the surveillance court has applied the law " in a way that is contrary to the text and purpose of the statute			2
" opinion : the @entity3 spies and democrats look away the group also argues restrictions in federal law mean only the @entity0 can review surveillance court orders			1
the privacy center is suing as a @entity28 customer			2
its case is the first direct challenge to the surveillance court order and it says the @entity82 administration should have to publicly explain its legal justification for the spying program			1
the @entity0 does not comment on pending cases			2
the @entity86 has the option of formally replying to the petition as well as asking for more time to do so			0
that could delay high court consideration of the appeal for another few months			0
prior lawsuits against the @entity3 program have been unsuccessful			0
the @entity94 has challenged the telephone surveillance in @entity97 federal court			1
and @entity98 also filed a separate claim on behalf of @entity28 customers			0
telecommunications companies were the initial targets of legal action after the @entity3 domestic surveillance program was unveiled in 2005			0
@entity105 later gave retroactive immunity to those firms			0
the surveillance court secretly decides whether to grant certain types of government requests , including wiretapping , data analysis , and other monitoring of possible terrorists and spies operating in the @entity1			2
legal sources say the tiny courtroom and adjacent areas are sealed tightly to prevent any eavesdropping by outsiders			0
eleven federal judges from around the country serve on the court for seven - year terms			0
they are appointed by the chief justice of the @entity1			0
@entity126 has named all current members , as a well as a three - judge panel to hear appeals of related orders			0
because it hears only the government 's side of an issue it has been criticized as a " kangaroo court " that too easily accedes to any government request .			0
