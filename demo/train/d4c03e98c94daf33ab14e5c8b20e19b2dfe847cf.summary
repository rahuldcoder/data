@entity0 -- in the wake of the suicide bombing at @entity7 , new security guidance has gone out to @entity3 bases across @entity9 , @entity3 military officials said			1
the december 30 suicide attack killed seven @entity12 officers and contractors , along with a @entity15 military officer who was the attacker 's handler			0
former @entity12 official @entity17 called it the greatest loss of life for the agency since the 1983 bombing of the @entity23 in @entity24 , @entity25 , which killed eight agents			0
a @entity3 intelligence official , speaking on condition of anonymity , told @entity1 on wednesday the attack was believed to have come on orders from " the highest levels " of @entity33			1
@entity34 , a former @entity12 officer who has advised president @entity35 on @entity33 , said the attack showed the capacity of terrorists to strike at @entity3 targets remained " very significant			1
" " it 's a very , very sophisticated operation , " @entity34 said			0
" it must have taken a long time to plan and to set up			0
" in response , @entity3 military officials said they were changing procedures			1
" suffice it to say that after any serious incident we evaluate the circumstances , think through the threat implications given our current practices and disseminate guidance to the field if adjustments are necessary , " a senior military official said			1
the official would not describe the new security procedures because " we do n't broadcast the specific changes we 've made to security postures or our intelligence procedures			1
" a second @entity3 military official said the guidance is meant to adjust procedures as quickly as possible on a large scale			1
" we do n't want just the military intelligence guys looking out for specific things			0
we need mps and ground forces to be aware , " the official said			0
the official said the security guidance is meant to be disseminated to as wide a group as possible , while more specific guidance on intelligence operations is kept to a much more limited , restricted distribution			1
the officials had not seen specific guidance on handling sources , but both noted only one week has passed since the incident , and the investigation may not have progressed far enough to produce formal recommendations in that area			2
one official said the intelligence officers on the ground now know enough details to " self - correct " procedures			1
according to sources , the @entity15 suicide bomber was @entity90 , a one - time militant who then appeared to be helping the @entity3			2
@entity91 was offering information on the possible whereabouts of @entity94 , the deputy to @entity95 , the sources said , and was picked up outside the base and driven into it without being checked			0
the sources said @entity100 detonated the bomb shortly after arriving			0
the attack shed light on the role of @entity15 as a previously covert partner in the @entity3 hunt for @entity95 and @entity107			2
" the @entity15 intelligence service is the best intelligence service in the @entity109 and @entity110 , bar none , " @entity34 said			0
" they are far more effective in working against jihadist groups like @entity33 in @entity114 like the @entity33 core in @entity116 than any other intelligence service			2
" @entity1 's @entity118 and @entity119 contributed to this report .			0
