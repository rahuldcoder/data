the @entity0 is turning to a familiar -- but some would say unexpected -- name to lead its team at the next @entity5 : @entity6 yes , even though @entity6 was the losing captain as @entity8 rallied in 2012 in the miracle at @entity10 in @entity11 , the 50 - year - old will succeed @entity12 at the 2016 edition at @entity14 in @entity15			1
he 'll go up against @entity16 , who last week got the nod for @entity8			1
@entity6 was unveiled tuesday , about five months after the @entity18 set up a @entity5 task force in the wake of another loss to @entity8 in golf 's most prestigious team event			1
love himself was part of the 11 - person committee , joining the likes of @entity27 , @entity28 and past captains @entity30 and @entity31			0
@entity6 named @entity32 as a vice-captain			2
" i am here with the same goal as in 2012 but not as the same captain , " @entity6 told reporters			1
" it is a great honor to be in the position to help build the team , but our mission does n't end there			0
what we accomplish in 2016 at @entity14 must serve as the foundation for future @entity0 @entity5 teams , " @entity6 said separately in a statement			1
the 2012 @entity5 will no doubt serve as motivation			2
with the @entity0 seemingly coasting to victory -- holding a 10 - 6 lead entering the final day -- @entity8 won eight of the last 12 matches to eke out a 14 1/2 - 13 1/2 win			1
and when the @entity0 was unable to overturn its skid last year at @entity55 in @entity56 , it meant a sixth defeat in the last seven @entity58			1
given the record it 's not surprising that criticism followed , but no one quite expected @entity28 to lay into @entity12 -- who was yards away -- at a post series press conference			0
@entity28 attended tuesday 's press conference with @entity6			2
@entity27 skipped the @entity67 as he recovered from a back injury and who knows if the slumping 14 - time major champion will return next year			0
he 's currently taking a break from golf			0
he , though , gave his backing to @entity6			0
" i want to congratulate @entity75 on his selection , " @entity27 said in a statement			0
" i have great respect for him as a person , player and captain			0
i know he 'll do an outstanding job leading the 2016 @entity0 team			2
" i 'm proud of what the task force accomplished , making substantive changes in the captain 's selection process and qualifying system			0
" as a player , @entity6 played in six @entity58 and compiled a singles record of three wins and a loss , halving two matches .			1
