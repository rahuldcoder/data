@entity0 -- @entity3 regulators discounted concerns about damage to the still - potent spent fuel from the @entity9 nuclear power plant 's no. 4 reactor thursday , saying high radiation levels reported earlier this week " most probably " came from outside debris			1
a high reading above the pool prompted the plant 's owner , the @entity16 , to take a sample from the spent fuel pool on tuesday			1
but the radiation levels are far lower than they would be if there were damage to the fuel rods , said @entity23 , the chief spokesman for @entity3 's @entity24			1
" we need more analysis to identify the precise status of the spent fuel in unit 4 , " he said			1
@entity16 said thursday night that the sample was the first time they have taken a reading off one of the spent fuel pools			1
the water temperature in the no. 4 pool was 90 degrees @entity36 , more than twice a normal reading , and more coolant water was poured into the reservoir on wednesday			2
the company said it suspects the fuel rods were damaged due to insufficient coolant at some point since the crisis began , but could not clarify the timing			0
@entity23 told reporters thursday evening that the fuel rods have not suffered " any particular damage			0
" officials are still looking at the readings from that water sample before reaching a final conclusion , but said the radiation reading was " most probably due to debris " blown into the badly damaged housing around the no. 4 reactor			2
the @entity16 reported a cumulative radiation reading above the pool at 84 millisieverts on tuesday , about a third of the annual allowable dose for plant workers during the emergency			2
water samples from the pool showed a concentration of radioactive @entity66 , the most commonly measured reactor byproduct , at 220,000 bequerels per liter -- more than 730 times the amount considered safe for drinking water in @entity3			1
outside observers have expressed concerns about the status of the spent fuel in reactors 1 , 3 and 4 several times during the month - long crisis at @entity9 , about 240 km ( 150 miles ) north of @entity0			1
temperature sensors in those pools have been out since mid-march , and workers have been spraying water into the damaged housings of those reactors on a near - daily basis to keep them topped off			0
the battle began march 11 , when the tsunami that followed @entity3 's magnitude 9 earthquake knocked out the plant 's cooling systems			1
@entity16 estimated the height of that wall of water at 14 to 15 m ( 45 to 48 feet ) -- a level @entity23 said would be the new standard for barriers around @entity3 nuclear power plants			1
the sea wall around @entity9 was 5 m. in the aftermath of the tsunami , the cores of three of @entity9 's six reactors were damaged by overheating and resulting hydrogen explosions blew apart the buildings surrounding reactors 1 and 3			0
the vast amount of radiation released from the plant , largely in the first two weeks of the disaster , prompted @entity3 authorities to rate the crisis at the top of the international scale that measures nuclear accidents			1
the level 7 designation puts @entity9 on par with the april 1986 @entity116 accident in the @entity117 , though @entity3 authorities say their plant has spewed only 10 percent of the radioactivity that was emitted from @entity116			0
plant workers have been pouring hundreds of tons of water a day into the three reactors that were damaged in the aftermath , and at least one of the reactors , in unit 2 , is believed to be leaking highly radioactive water			0
radioactive contamination spread across a wide swath of land around the plant and into the adjacent @entity132 , though data released by government ministries has shown a decline in radiation levels in recent weeks			1
engineers have taken steps this week toward containing the disaster , pumping radioactive water from service trenches and tunnels into a storage reservoir for no. 2 reactor 's steam condensers			0
and they are laying the piping needed to transfer an estimated 10,000 tons into a facility designed for treating low - level radioactive waste @entity16 said thursday			0
the company dumped more than 9,000 tons of less - radioactive water into the @entity132 last week to make room for the more - dangerous fluid believed to be leaking from reactor no. 2 -- a move @entity3 authorities described as an emergency measure , but one that enraged the country 's fishermen			2
the government issued expanded evacuation orders monday for several towns outside the 30 - kilometer radius that was declared a danger zone in the early days of the disaster , warning that prolonged exposure to radiation levels there could pose a long - term danger to human health			2
and @entity3 government data this week reported finding low levels of radioactive strontium , another reactor byproduct , in two of those towns in the days after the disaster			2
@entity174 is considered a health hazard not only because of its 29 - year radioactive half - life but because a portion of it gets absorbed by bone if ingested , according to the @entity181 @entity180			0
there is no acceptable standard for strontium under @entity3 regulations , but @entity3 's science ministry said the reported figures were not high enough to pose an immediate danger to human health			1
the @entity3 government has tried to limit the damage done to farmers in @entity9 and other prefectures where contamination from the plant has been found , lifting bans on farm products from surrounding areas if they pass three tests in three successive weeks			0
chief cabinet secretary @entity200 , the government 's point man on the crisis , announced thursday that kakina , a leafy green , from @entity205 was now safe for shipment			0
the move follows a ban on outdoor - grown shiitake mushrooms from 16 towns and villages neighboring damaged plant to the country 's banned food list wednesday			0
@entity215 , gen @entity216 and @entity217 contributed to this report for @entity1 .			0

new : radiation levels at unit 4 " most probably " came from debris , a @entity3 official said
new : the march tsunami will set a new standard for @entity228 nuclear plants
samples show high radiation levels in unit 4 's spent fuel pool
