-- each year @entity1 does what she can to stop @entity3 turning into a desert			1
for the last 12 years the native of @entity6 has planted saplings in @entity8 trying to reforest the region , but also to keep the memory of her dead son alive			1
in 2000 , @entity1 's only son was killed in a traffic accident in @entity14			1
@entity1 almost succumbed to grief , but instead decided to devote her life to living out her son 's dream of planting trees in the deserts of @entity8			1
" he was fond of nature since he was a little boy , " @entity1 said of her son , @entity21			2
" he was concerned about natural things such as wind , rain , plants , and animals			0
" through the non-profit organization @entity30 , the project has changed from being a tribute to her child to a campaign to raise awareness of the land degradation that is rapidly turning @entity3 's grasslands into barren plains			1
after the tragic accident @entity1 used the insurance money from @entity21 's death -- 30 million @entity14 yen -- to set up @entity30 in 2003			1
it was n't easy at first , said @entity1 , but in the past 11 years the group has planted more than one million trees			1
" in the beginning , i did this charity as a mother who wanted to realize her son 's dream , " said @entity1			1
" but later i realized that @entity3 has a really serious desertification problem ... if the situation keeps getting worse , how can 1.3 billion @entity3 people possibly survive ? so we felt a sense of social responsibility			1
" read more : bringing smiles to tsunami survivors almost a quarter of @entity3 , an enormous 2.6 million square kilometers across 18 provinces , is classified as desert			1
in the autonomous region of @entity8 alone , sandy plains accounts for an area greater than the size of @entity65			0
overgrazing , population growth , logging and droughts are largely responsible , according to researchers			0
one of the biggest challenges for @entity1 has been fundraising			0
she and her husband have invested most of their life 's savings in the project and sold two houses to keep the initiative going			1
" because we have limited funds , we can only afford a small operation team while there is a lot to do , " said @entity1			0
" i 'm 66 years old now			2
but i have only an average of three to four hours of sleep every day			0
sometimes i do n't even have this amount of sleep			0
it 's all for saving money for the project			1
" @entity1 and her husband began their endeavor with little knowledge of agriculture and their first planting season was not a success : rainfall that year was less than 200mm and the saplings were blown over by strong winds and the shifting sands			0
but after seeking help from local forestry specialists in the second year many saplings took root in the harsh landscape			0
" it seemed that my son 's spirits bestowed good fortune on us -- it rained heavily when we finished , " said @entity1			2
" ever since , we would go and plant trees every year , and it rained every time			2
this made the survival rate stay above 85 % even till now			0
" since 2008 , there has been an increase in volunteers and donors , which @entity1 says gives her and her husband strength and enables the project to keep running			2
among them are a number of parents who lost their own children , including one mother who lost her college - aged daughter to cancer , and another mother whose son committed suicide			2
" it is easy to break a chopstick , but they become unbreakable when we put all of them together , " said @entity1			0
" everyone on the planet has his or her own weaknesses , but with one complementing the other , we will eventually get a big force			0
environmental problems especially need this kind of power from people with benevolence			0
" @entity0 's @entity148 and @entity149 contributed to this report .			2
