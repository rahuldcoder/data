postmaster general @entity1 is n't paid as much as leaders of some other independent government agencies			1
and the amount is far below that given to ceos in the private sector , even though compensation and benefit packages for postal service officers are required by law to be comparable to those given to private - sector employees doing similar work , the board of governors says			1

a new postal law in 2006 , @entity24 said , gave the postal service more flexibility to devise a compensation plan that did n't focus on salary			1

@entity1 saw his civil service pension fund rise by $ 381,496 in 2008 , and he received a $ 135,041 incentive pay that will be deferred to his retirement , according to a filing released december 10			2
