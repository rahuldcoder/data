@entity0 -- the danger of @entity7 radicalization inside @entity9 prisons " remains real and present , " said rep. @entity2 , the @entity3 chairman of the @entity4			1
but during a wednesday hearing on the subject , others said there are only a few cases in which prison radicalization has been linked to terrorism			1
" prisons have not served as a major source of jihad radicalization , " according to @entity19 , a @entity20 sociology professor			1
@entity19 said that since the september 11 attacks , 178 @entity21 have been prosecuted for terrorism or related charges , but there is evidence in only 12 cases that prison radicalization was a factor			2
" if prisons were a major cause of jihadist radicalization , we would expect to see a lot of it , but we do n't , " @entity19 added			2
the ranking @entity37 on the committee , rep. @entity35 of @entity36 , says that judging from the information he 's seen , " the risk of terrorism originating from @entity7 converts in @entity9 prisons is small			2
" @entity35 and several other democrats on the panel also complained that the @entity2 hearing focused only on @entity46 in prisons and did not address other groups such as gangs and white supremacists			1
" i actually believe that the focus on one particular group on the basis of race or religion can be deemed as racist and discriminatory , " @entity51 democrat @entity50 said , adding that members of other groups could pose threats as well			2
@entity2 blasted back that when @entity43 were last in control of the @entity4 and his committee , they never brought up threats from some of the groups they were mentioning now			1
@entity2 also distinguished radical @entity46 from other groups , saying @entity7 radicals could be connected to terror groups overseas			1
do @entity2 's hearings betray @entity9 values ? @entity71 , who heads the counterterrorism unit for the @entity73 , told the committee he takes the threat of radicalization in prison very seriously and thinks " we are on the front end " of a growing problem			1
@entity71 and other witnesses called for an in - depth study of the problem and for standards on vetting prison chaplains and on reading materials and videos that prisoners are allowed			1
" there 's radical material inside the prison system still			0
@entity98 's material is inside the prison systems , " @entity71 said in reference to the @entity93 - @entity9 cleric who @entity9 officials contend is a key member of @entity96			0
he is accused of involvement in the plot to blow up an airliner headed into @entity103 in december 2009 and the 2010 plot involving explosives placed in copiers on planes headed for the @entity9			0
@entity2 cited a number of terrorism cases involving prison radicalization , including that of @entity112 , who pleaded guilty in may to wanting to blow up a @entity114 , @entity115 , courthouse ; @entity116 , who was convicted in a plot to use surface - to - air missiles against a troop transport aircraft in @entity121 and detonate explosive devices at a @entity123 and a synagogue ; and @entity125 , who was convicted in @entity127 in 2007 of providing material support to terrorism			1
hearings recall my life in internment camp another case cited by @entity2 and the committee 's witnesses involved @entity137 , who was serving time in a @entity51 prison where he formed a radical group called @entity140 and recruited a fellow prisoner named @entity0			1
when @entity0 was paroled , he recruited a couple of other men , and they plotted to attack a military recruiting station and a @entity123 target			0
@entity137 was involved with the plot while he remained behind bars and was later convicted for his actions			0
@entity149 , a prosecutor on the @entity137 case , said @entity137 taught himself about @entity7 and because of his charisma was able to entice others to join his plot			0
@entity149 said the prison system was not able to interfere with @entity137 preaching about @entity7 to fellow prisoners			2
perhaps the most emotional moment in the hearing came when rep. @entity158 , @entity159 , talked about childhood friends who went to prison but were never able to get their lives back on track			2
@entity158 said too many people go to prison when they should be treated for mental illness or drug use			0
" we are spending too much money incarcerating young men , young black men whose lives can be saved , " @entity158 said			0
" it 's not about @entity7			0
it 's about the sentencing policy			0
it 's about this prison system			0
