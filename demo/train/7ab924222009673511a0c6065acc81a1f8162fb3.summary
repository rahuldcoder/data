@entity2 @entity0 and @entity1 are set to meet in @entity4 on thursday for a meeting that @entity0 scheduled before @entity1 announced this month that he 's seriously considering a third presidential run			1
a senior @entity8 strategist familiar with the plans , speaking only on condition of anonymity , confirmed that the sit - down was put in the books some time ago , " in the couple to several weeks range			0
" the source said the meeting , which was first reported by @entity18 on wednesday , was requested by @entity0 as a gesture of respect for @entity1 's leadership role in the party â € ” much like a recent @entity0 - @entity24 meeting that took place at @entity0 's request			1
and now ? " well obviously governor @entity1 has changed the dynamics , " the source said			1
separately , two @entity1 sources and a senior @entity0 source confirmed that the meeting will take place			1
@entity0 was spotted thursday morning by @entity32 boarding a flight from @entity2 to @entity34			2
asked if it was true he 's meeting with @entity1 , @entity0 responded : " i like to ski			1
" when he arrived in @entity34 , he was met by a crowd of reporters and supporters who followed him from the gate through the airport			0
one man approached @entity0 and handed him what looked like a business card			2
" i 'm a @entity8			0
i 'm in the oil business			0
and i 'm an actor , " the man said			0
" and i voted for your dad			0
" " thank you , " @entity0 said , accepting the card as he continued to walk			2
@entity0 briefly signed autographs outside and was followed by the small flock until he got into an suv			2
" thank you , mr. president , " one man shouted			0
the former @entity57 governor 's itinerary this week also includes a speech friday in @entity59 at the @entity61 convention			2
@entity1 told a group of donors in @entity64 on jan. 9 that he was angling towards another run at the @entity66 , less than a month after @entity0 jumped to @entity8 frontrunner status following his own announcement that he was actively exploring a bid			1
the @entity1 announcement shook the early 2016 pre-presidential campaign and sparked confusion and competition as both men were now courting similar donors and influential @entity8 behind the scenes			2
making the competition more tense was a new @entity32 poll this week that showed nearly six in 10 republicans want @entity1 to run for president , while 50 % feel the same about @entity0			1
one reporter at the airport in @entity4 asked if the meeting would be awkward			0
" no , " @entity0 replied flatly			0
at times , their paths have almost crossed			0
@entity1 spoke publicly at last week 's @entity88 meeting in @entity89 , for example , while @entity0 was also in @entity92 courting donors			1
their circles are further overlapping as the two potential candidates start to staff up			0
@entity3 's @entity96 reported earlier this week that two of @entity1 's former aides -- @entity99 and @entity100 -- are poised to play key roles in a potential @entity0 campaign			1
ever since the prospect of a third @entity1 campaign became serious , @entity0 has played nice about his potential competitor			1
according to @entity106 , @entity0 praised the 2012 nominee at a private fundraiser wednesday in @entity2 , saying he does n't expect he 'll need to wage ugly campaigns against his opponents to win a primary			0
neither @entity0 nor @entity1 are scheduled so far to attend a major gathering of conservatives this weekend in @entity114			1
nearly 10 prospective @entity8 candidates , including gov. @entity116 , will speak at the @entity117 in @entity118 on saturday hosted by @entity119 and rep. @entity120			0
while @entity0 's absence has stoked speculation that the former governor might plan to leave the first - in - the - nation caucus state out of his campaign strategy , @entity0 called the state 's @entity8 chairman on wednesday to assure him that he plans to make @entity114 a priority , the @entity121 reported			2
" what i heard is a man that 's ready to come out and tackle the @entity137 state , " @entity130 said , though he noted that @entity0 stressed he 's still only considering a run and has n't become an official candidate			1
last week @entity138 , mayor of @entity139 , @entity140 , tweeted that @entity0 had called him and told him he plans on coming to the @entity140 , which holds the nominating season 's first primary , at some point , according to the @entity144			1
@entity3 's @entity145 and @entity146 contributed to this report .			0

@entity1 and @entity0 are scheduled to meet this week in @entity4 , a source says
it 's the first time the two will meet since @entity1 became more serious about another run for president
