@entity0 -- the @entity2 voted wednesday to approve the new nuclear arms control treaty with @entity4 -- a major foreign policy victory for the @entity7 administration near the end of the lame - duck session of @entity10			1
the @entity11 , or @entity11 , was cleared by a 71 - 26 vote			1
several @entity13 joined a unified @entity15 caucus in support of the accord			1
under @entity2 rules , the treaty required support from a two - thirds majority of voting senators for final approval			1
" this is the most significant arms control agreement in nearly two decades , " president @entity7 said after the vote			1
it " will enhance our leadership to stop the spread of nuclear weapons and seek the peace of a world without them			2
" bipartisan passage of the measure " sends a powerful signal to the world that @entity13 and @entity15 stand together on behalf of our security			1
" if ratified , the treaty would resume inspections of each country 's nuclear arsenal while limiting both the @entity42 and @entity4 to 1,550 warheads and 700 launchers			1
it still needs to be approved by the @entity4 parliament			0
@entity7 signed the treaty with @entity4 president @entity47 in april			1
the accord is considered a critical component of nuclear non-proliferation efforts and the administration 's attempt to " reset " @entity0 's relationship with @entity54			2
several senators were reassured by the last - minute passage of an amendment stating that the accord should not be interpreted in a way that would hamper @entity42 missile defense plans			1
the amendment was sponsored by @entity13 senators @entity63 of @entity64 and @entity65 of @entity66 , among others			1
others said they had been assured of an administration commitment to modernize @entity42 's aging nuclear arsenal			2
" the people of the world are watching us , because they rely on our leadership , " said @entity72 chairman @entity71 , @entity73			0
it is time to " move the world a little more out of the dark shadow of nuclear nightmare			0
" " we are the leading nuclear power on this earth			0
it is our responsibility to lead , " said sen. @entity83 , @entity84			0
this treaty is " a step in the right direction			0
" @entity91 sen. @entity90 , the top @entity13 on the @entity72 , called it a step forward in terms of constraining " expensive arms competition with @entity4 " and frustrating " rogue nations who would prefer as much distance as possible between the @entity42 and @entity4			1
" not all @entity13 were convinced of the treaty 's merits , however			1
sen. @entity100 , @entity102 - @entity101 , argued on the @entity2 floor that the basic premise of the treaty -- that @entity42 's nuclear arsenal should be at parity with @entity4 's -- is flawed			1
" @entity4 is a protector of none and a threat to many			0
@entity42 is a protector of many and a threat to none , " @entity100 said			0
@entity100 also voiced an ongoing conservative complaint in the lame - duck session -- that @entity15 were ramming the treaty through as part of a long list of partisan priorities rejected by the public in the midterm elections			2
" we should not be passing major legislation at this time of year with this @entity10 , " he said			0
the arms pact is part of " a continued effort of accommodation and appeasement " that makes a " mockery of the debate and ratification process			0
" sen. @entity133 , @entity134 , called the treaty " an echo from the 20th century " that fails to account for new and emerging threats			0
@entity133 and several other senators expressed a fear that the treaty would weaken @entity42 's ability to prevent potential nuclear attacks from countries such as @entity143 and @entity144			2
@entity63 himself , despite passage of the amendment he sponsored , ultimately voted against the accord , as well			1
he argued that that it " re-establishes an old and outdated linkage between nuclear arms and missile defense , which is no longer suited to the threats of today 's world			1
" passage of the treaty appeared to be in doubt for weeks			0
a late burst of support came tuesday , however , after treaty supporters voted down or tabled several @entity13 amendments , saying they were unnecessary and would imperil the pact by reopening negotiated language or understandings with @entity4			1
the defeated amendments included adding a reference to tactical nuclear weapons and a bid to remove from the preamble language recognizing a relationship between offensive and defensive weapons			0
a number of senior military leaders publicly endorsed the treaty , including adm. @entity175 , chairman of the @entity176			0
" this treaty has the full support of your uniformed military , and we all support its ratification , " @entity175 wrote in a letter read monday by @entity71			0
the late endorsement helped undercut a move by some conservatives to delay final consideration of the treaty until january , when @entity13 will have a stronger minority in the @entity2 and , therefore , more leverage			1
@entity7 and @entity15 leaders , conversely , pushed strongly to get the agreement passed before their majority in the @entity2 diminishes			2
in a sign of the high stakes involved , @entity7 and other top administration officials , including vice president @entity194 and secretary of state @entity195 , all talked to individual senators in recent days to seek support for the treaty			1
@entity194 , acting in his capacity as president of the @entity2 , personally presided over the final vote			0
@entity203 also went to @entity204 to discuss the issue with former @entity2 colleagues			0
sen. @entity207 , @entity208 , managed to make it to the @entity2 for the vote despite undergoing prostate cancer surgery monday			0
a joyous atmosphere was seen on the floor after the vote -- likely the last @entity2 action of the lame - duck session			2
the treaty 's supporters and opponents alike congratulated @entity90 and @entity71 , the key congressional proponents of the accord			2
an overwhelming majority of @entity42 support ratification of the treaty , according to a @entity226 poll released tuesday : 73 percent of people questioned in the national poll said the @entity2 should approve the accord , while 24 percent said senators should reject it			2
@entity1 's @entity231 , @entity232 , @entity233 , @entity234 and @entity235 contributed to this report .			0
