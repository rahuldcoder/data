editor 's note : @entity2 is an author and foreign affairs analyst who hosts " @entity4 " on @entity5 on sundays at 1 and 5 p.m. et. @entity2 says we still have a problem with @entity8 , and we have to have a strategy in dealing with the country			1
@entity11 ( @entity5 ) -- three leading @entity8 reformists who have rejected the results of last month 's election questioned the legitimacy of president @entity17 's government wednesday			2
this comes as @entity17 is set to take office at the end of the month			0
presidential candidate @entity21 wrote a letter in his party 's newspaper , saying he would not recognize the government and vowing to " stand by the people and the revolution , until the end of my life			0
" his statement prompted @entity8 's government to block publication of the newspaper			1
@entity17 's main political rival , @entity36 , also released a statement wednesday criticizing the government and its crackdown on the media , which he said has created a " bitter , coup d'etat atmosphere " in @entity8			1
@entity8 's former reformist president @entity42 called on @entity8 to keep up the struggle , noting that " all doors are not yet closed			1
" author and foreign affairs analyst @entity2 spoke to @entity5 about this week 's events in @entity8			1
@entity5 : what is the likely outcome of events in @entity8 ? @entity2 : the situation is fluid			1
the challenger , @entity36 , and the former president , @entity42 , are still criticizing the government for stealing the election			0
that is an extraordinary level of dissent at the highest levels of the establishment			0
but the most likely outcome remains that for now , the regime will be able to reassert order			1
but it has become a naked dictatorship , losing the facade of the @entity67 and democratic political ideals that are important to it			1
@entity5 : but the nuclear program continues ? @entity2 : exactly			1
we still have a problem with @entity8 , and we have to have a strategy in dealing with it			2
the nuclear program continues to grow , and refusing to negotiate will not do anything to stop it			1
on the other hand , it seems wrong to pretend that nothing has happened in @entity8			2
and it also disregards the reality of a divided leadership			0
@entity5 : so , what to do ? @entity2 : i would say do nothing			2
inaction can be a strategy			0
the five major powers on the @entity88 ( plus @entity89 ) have given @entity8 a very generous offer to restart the nuclear negotiations			1
so , the ball is in its court			0
until it does , the @entity94 should build support for tougher sanctions and more isolation			2
until we hear from @entity100 , there is no reason for the @entity102 or the others to get engaged			0
@entity5 : is this from a position of weakness , because the @entity94 has so few options ? @entity2 : not really , because while it might seem like the @entity94 has few options , in reality , @entity8 has fewer			1
its economy is doing badly , the regime is facing its greatest challenge since its founding , and its proxies in @entity115 , @entity116 and elsewhere are all faring worse than it had expected			0
let the supreme leader and president @entity17 figure out what they should do first			0
time might not be on their side			0
@entity5 : what about a military strike ? @entity2 : it would be bizarre to bomb @entity8 -- which means bombing @entity8 -- now that we have seen the inside of that country			1
@entity36 and his supporters want a less confrontational approach to the world			0
so do many members of the establishment			0
@entity36 attacked @entity17 repeatedly for his aggressive foreign policy			0
so we now know the answer to the question , " are there moderates in @entity8 ? " yes , millions of them .			2

@entity2 says most likely that @entity8 regime will reassert order , for now
but , he says , @entity8 has lost facade of @entity67 and democratic political ideals
best strategy on @entity8 's nuclear program could be to do nothing , he says
@entity2 says until @entity94 hears back on offer for talks , it does *n't* need to get engaged
