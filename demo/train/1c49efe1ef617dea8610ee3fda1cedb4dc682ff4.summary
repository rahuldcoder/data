@entity0 , @entity1 -- even as potent winds and heavy rains lingered in spots , residents through huge swaths of the eastern @entity5 spent saturday trying to come to grips with vicious storms that obliterated communities , reduced scores of homes to rubble and left at least 37 people dead			1
about 17 million from @entity16 to @entity1 to @entity17 were affected by the massive tornado outbreak that began friday , and continued into the weekend			1
of the 37 victims , 18 were in @entity20 , 14 in @entity1 , three in @entity21 , and one each in @entity23 and @entity24			1
much of saturday was focused on assessing the damage , treating the wounded and grieving those killed			1
but in parts of southern @entity24 and northern @entity30 , it meant braving heavy rain and high wind as far south as @entity33 all tied to the same powerful system			1
in @entity36 , @entity24 , strong winds " destroyed " several houses , felled trees , spurred major outages , and caused what appears to be minor damage to several buildings behind a hospital , @entity35 county sheriff @entity35 told @entity2			1
he said he was unsure if there were any related injuries			2
the @entity47 received two reports of tornadoes saturday in @entity50 , which is about 30 miles north of the @entity30 border			2
meanwhile , residents from @entity23 to @entity21 spent saturday trying to make sense of the chaos -- and right their lives -- after the previous day 's devastating tornadoes			1
piles of debris took the place of well - built homes			2
high winds toppled tall trees			1
bright yellow school buses smashed into buildings			2
garbage bins and wooden beams flew through the air with the force of a jet airliner			0
churches turned into shelters and thousands of people began a weekend unnerved by nature 's fury			1
in hard - hit @entity0 , @entity1 , rescuers combed for survivors after a twister ripped through the town 20 miles north of @entity79			1
@entity80 , a @entity47 meteorologist , said the tornado that swept through that and other @entity1 communities was an @entity84 - 4 -- meaning it had sustained winds of between 166 and 200 mph , putting it in the top 2 % of all tornadoes in terms of strength			1
it went for 52 miles and was roughly 150 yards wide , he added			0
there were no active searches for survivors as of 5 p.m. saturday , said sgt. @entity94 of the @entity95			1
the breadth of destruction left authorities , however , with " no idea how many people are homeless			0
" " there are a lot of people who ca n't sit down on their own couch this evening , " @entity94 said			0
@entity107 , 64 , huddled under a blanket with his wife for safety in the middle of their one - story home -- as they 'd done many other times -- when the tornado " hit head on , " their daughter @entity105 told @entity2 on saturday			1
a neighbor eventually found @entity119 some 30 feet away from her husband , bleeding but apparently not suffering from life - threatening injuries			0
@entity107 , however , did not survive			0
" whether you wanted to laugh or not , he always put a smile on your face , " said @entity105 , remembering her father			1
amid the mounting reports of death and destruction , there was some good news			0
a 20 - month - old girl was found alive , alone and injured in a field in @entity133 , about 20 miles south of @entity0 , said maj. @entity134 , a sheriff 's department spokesman			2
she was later identified and family members joined her at the hospital			0
however , she remained in critical condition saturday afternoon , @entity139 spokesman @entity138 said			0
at @entity0 's high school and adjacent elementary school , staff had huddled in the office area with about 40 students who had not been able to go home and prayed as twisters approached			2
" it 's a blessing			2
we praise @entity151 " that no one was hurt , said @entity149 , the elementary school principal			0
added @entity80 , from the weather service , " there could have been scores of fatalities " had most students not been let out early			2
unfortunately , many nearby residents were not so lucky			0
it was unclear how many people were missing in @entity0 , as well as the towns of @entity162 , @entity163 and @entity164 -- all hit by tornadoes -- because authorities are still trying to wrap their arms around the sheer amount of devastation , @entity134 said			2
" @entity164 is almost completely gone , " @entity134 told @entity2 affiliate @entity170 , out of @entity79 , @entity20			1
in @entity162 , east of @entity0 , @entity171 told @entity170 that the bodies of his aunt and uncle , @entity175 and @entity176 , and their 4 - year - old grandchild were discovered in a field , covered in debris			0
his own home , he said , also was gone			0
president @entity182 talked saturday with the governors of @entity1 , @entity20 and @entity21 to express his concerns , offer condolences for those killed and provide federal assistance if needed , the @entity181 said in a statement			1
to that point , the @entity189 said it has been in touch with emergency management officials in the affected states			0
" our thoughts and prayers are with those who have lost loved ones and those whose lives have been affected by the storms , " said @entity189 administrator @entity194			0
roughly 250 @entity203 troops have been called in to provide aid and security in @entity0 , @entity164 and elsewhere , said sgt. 1st @entity206			0
in @entity20 , similar scenes played out as gov. @entity208 declared a statewide emergency and ordered the deployment of 220 @entity203 troops to join a 12 - person team searching for survivors in @entity214			1
around 5 p.m. saturday , the governor detailed -- citing the state @entity216 -- 18 fatalities in six counties , including five in @entity220			1
one apparent tornado made its way down @entity223 in @entity224 , shredding buildings and overturning cars along the way			2
@entity228 , with @entity214 's emergency management agency , reported that several people were rescued -- including one man trapped under up to 10 feet of debris -- though four died as a result of the storm across the county			1
" it 's been a tough night , " said @entity214 executive @entity236			2
" we are ( fortunate ) to report four ( dead ) and not 104 , because we could have lost a whole lot more lives in this thing			0
" in @entity243 , there were reports of possible tornado touchdowns in nine counties , according to @entity247 , the state 's emergency management spokesman			1
the @entity47 later confirmed a tornado hit at least in @entity251 , @entity252 and @entity254 counties			1
at least 29 people were injured across the state			0
the storms also moved through northern @entity24 late friday			0
a tornado was believed to have struck north @entity24 's @entity259 , damaging two elementary schools , a small local airfield and an undetermined number of homes , said @entity264 , a sheriff 's spokesman			1
aerial images showed roofs ripped off houses , exposing bedrooms , kitchens and garages			0
in one , a couple survived by getting into the bathtub with their 6 - month - old child , @entity264 said			0
" thank goodness there were actually no injuries or fatalities reported in the @entity259 area , " he said			0
" that is amazing to me , looking at some of this damage			0
" but one person was killed in the suburban @entity288 city of @entity289			2
around @entity290 , @entity17 , at least three people were injured , said capt. @entity292 of the fire department			0
the @entity47 confirmed an @entity84 twister --- with maximum winds up to 135 mph -- struck early saturday morning along a roughly 3.8 - mile long , 175 - foot wide stretch through @entity298 and @entity299 counties			1
at least 20 homes were damaged , six of them extensively , according to the agency			0
in @entity21 , two people died in @entity306 and another in @entity307 due to the storms , @entity304 commissioner @entity303 said			1
" it 's like a bomb went off and everything is splintered , bricks are down , and trees , and just a lot of debris , " @entity21 gov. @entity314 said after touring damage in those and other nearby towns			1
he said that the state plans to work with the federal government to provide relief , though at this point there are no plans to request a federal disaster declaration			0
after talking with people who planned to rebuild , @entity314 vowed " we 'll be back			0
" " we 're knocked down , but we 're not knocked out , " he said			1
