-- just as the @entity1 inaugurated the dotcom mania of the 90s , so @entity5 's imminent ipo will trigger a hysteria with the social web			1
but the most interesting question is n't whether @entity5 is actually worth $ 100 billion or how many billions of dollars @entity10 will personally bank -- but whether or not @entity5 really will make the world a better place for its close to a billion users			1
@entity10 certainly thinks it will			0
" @entity5 was not originally created to be a company			1
it was built to accomplish a social mission -- to make the world more open and connected , " he wrote in a letter to shareholders that @entity5 filed with the @entity20 @entity19 yesterday			1
this social mission , @entity10 explained , has been designed to give people a voice , to change how society is organized and to bring us closer together as a species			0
@entity10 is n't alone in seeing @entity5 as a major engine of historical progress that will " build real value for the world "			1
as @entity33 , the former @entity20 treasury secretary , notes about the @entity5 offering , it 's " an @entity20 milestone " and @entity10 's company has the same historical significance as @entity37 or @entity38			1
and just as @entity37 pioneered the mass - produced motor car and @entity38 helped develop the personal computer , so @entity5 is ( re ) inventing the internet , transforming it from a solitary experience for anonymous individuals into a shared , social world			1
@entity45 , the @entity46 super-connector who introduced @entity10 to his first investor , calls this new world " @entity49 , " describing it as a place of " real identities generating massive amounts of data			0
" that data is , of course , all the personal details about ourselves -- the billions of photos , updates and videos that we post narcissistically on our @entity5 pages			1
we -- you and i -- are the company 's real product , the oil of our web 3.0 age			2
@entity5 aggregates and stores all our personal data and then sells access to it to advertisers			1
that is @entity5 's creepy business model and it 's why the seven - year - old company realized $ 3.71 billion of revenue in 2011			1
" you 've only got one identity , " @entity10 once remarked with his typical naivety about the human condition			0
and , of course , he wants to own that identity , even going as far as to develop a product called timeline which , quite literally , establishes an official narrative of our lives on his social network			0
rather than being just another highly - trafficked website , @entity5 's goal is become the operating system for the entire social web			1
through its @entity96 technology , @entity5 has introduced apps that allow us to tell our friends what movies we are watching , what books we are reading and what music we are listening to			1
as @entity105 explained when it made @entity10 its 2010 @entity106 , his goal is to transform the internet into a well - lit dorm room in which " wherever you go online , you 'll see your friends			2
" and , of course , your friends -- not to mention your parents , employers , teachers and everyone else online -- will see you			0
they 'll see you whatever you are doing and thinking and wherever you have been and will go			0
the impact of @entity5 on our privacy is deeply worrying			1
i 've argued that all this sharing is a trap , designed to tear open our lives			0
many other people are now worrying about @entity5 's cult of radical transparency and its willful disregard for privacy			1
@entity129 , the @entity130 commissioner for justice , is even seeking to establish a " right to forget " law which makes you and i , rather than @entity5 , the masters of our own personal data			1
@entity10 's strategy to promote his ipo is to present @entity5 as a technology company that exists for the public good			1
" there is a huge need and a huge opportunity to get everyone in the world connected , to give everyone a voice and to help transform society for the future , " he wrote in the @entity19 letter			0
but this is a fallacy			0
@entity5 is a privately owned , for profit enterprise that exists for the benefit of its shareholders and employees			1
connectivity benefits the company rather than us			0
@entity160 , we need to always remember , is a self - serving @entity46 ideology rather than a self - evident public good			2
so forget whether or not @entity5 is really worth $ 75 or $ 100 billion			1
ignore all the hocus - pocus about " floats " and how @entity166 bankers really value @entity5			1
the real value of @entity5 lies in whether all this radical transparency will make the world a better place			1
many think it will , arguing that @entity5 and its " internet of people " will deepen our democracy and make the world a more open place			2
the 1996 @entity1 led to the great stock market collapse of april 2000			2
but i fear that the 2012 @entity180 could lead to a much more human collapse			0
i worry about the disappearance of core values such as privacy , solitude and secrecy in our @entity49 world			1
so what 's at stake here goes beyond economics			2
it gets to the very core of what it means to be human in our ubiquitously networked age			2
drowning in a tsunami of sharing whether or not @entity5 realizes its imperial dream of becoming the operating system of our @entity49 world , there 's no doubt that social networks and social media companies are dramatically changing the internet 's architecture and its economy			1
on tuesday evening , i attended the @entity212 , @entity46 's annual @entity214 - style award ceremony , which were held in @entity216 's appropriately transparent @entity215			2
and while @entity5 failed to win any awards , its specter -- or , at least , the specter of social media -- hung heavily over the event			2
for better or worse , you see , everything and everyone inside @entity46 is going social			0
indeed , given the visibility of social media companies at the awards , the @entity212 could have been renamed the @entity228			0
almost every award went to a social company or entrepreneur			0
best new start - up was won by the social pinboard network @entity233			2
founder of the year went to @entity236 chairman @entity235 , while @entity236 itself won the @entity239 award			0
the @entity241 award went to @entity46 's most social investor , @entity45 , and the winner of ceo of the @entity246 award was @entity248 ceo @entity247			0
the @entity5 social game words with friends won the " @entity252 " award , and @entity254 award went to the @entity256 social commerce @entity257			2
@entity260 + was awarded the @entity261 , the photography sharing site @entity259 won @entity262 , the social network @entity264 won @entity266 award and the gay social network @entity268 won @entity269			0
the legendary @entity271 venture capitalist @entity270 described social as the third great wave of technological innovation , after the invention of the personal computer and the internet			0
@entity270 's wave is about to engulf all of us			0
are you ready to be drowned in an online tsunami of sharing ? introspection versus incessant updates one response to all the self - promotional noise of the social web came this week from a most unexpected source			0
@entity289 is the author of the new book " quiet : the power of @entity293 in a @entity291			0
" and " @entity295 , " which is one of the hottest selling books in @entity20 right now and was featured as the @entity105 cover story this week , is a reminder of the importance of introspection and solitude in our @entity5 , @entity303 and @entity236 age of incessant updates , retweets , likes and pokes			1
amidst all the hype of his ipo , i hope @entity10 has the opportunity to sit down and read the excellent " @entity295			0
" it may inspire him to think more critically about his " social mission " and the real value of giving everyone a " voice " to talk about themselves			0
