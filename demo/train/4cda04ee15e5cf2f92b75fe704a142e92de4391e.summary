-- two rain - soaked practice sessions for sunday 's @entity3 @entity2 have left @entity5 teams guessing what effect recent rule changes will have on this year 's world championship battle			1
@entity10 's ruling body , the @entity9 , has introduced rules banning the use of off - throttle blown diffusers , a technique used by drivers to increase downforce and therefore increase the speed of the car			2
but the impact of the law changes was hard to gauge on friday as drivers wrestled with a wet @entity23 track			2
@entity25 's @entity24 , who won the corresponding race in 2010 , setting the fastest time of the day during the opening session			1
@entity29 's @entity28 was quickest in the afternoon , more than three seconds slower than the @entity30 's earlier best			1
passing judgment : @entity32 must stay aggressive @entity24 's teammate and the current leader of the drivers ' standings , @entity34 , struggled to ascertain the impact of the new restrictions , with conditions frequently changing at the newly - renovated @entity41 circuit			1
" the circuit was changing a lot today , " world champion @entity34 told @entity5 's official web site after being 13th fastest and then 18th			1
" so it was hard to find out too much and understand the effect of the changes introduced this weekend , but we will learn more tomorrow			0
" sunday 's race will represent a home grand prix for @entity52 and their @entity3 driver @entity53 , who is 77 points behind @entity34 in the drivers ' championship and has never finished higher than fourth at the @entity58 circuit			1
@entity34 takes the quiet road to glory the 2009 world champion was disappointed to miss out on a chance to assess his car 's performance under the new regulations ahead of saturday 's qualifying sessions			2
" today was a bit of a frustrating day for me , " said the 31 - year - old , who was 15th in the morning and then fifth			0
" we thought we 'd get some good running under our belts this afternoon , but the rain meant that did n't happen , and we did n't really get a chance to evaluate everything			0
" hopefully , it 's not going to rain for the rest of the weekend , so we should be able to get a better read on how the new interpretations of the regulations will affect us from tomorrow			0
" we do n't really know if our new rear wing is an improvement over the older version			0
it has a different downforce level , but i 'm still not sure what we 're going to run for the rest of the weekend			0
" @entity5 championship standings @entity28 's teammate @entity90 has triumphed once before at @entity23 , in 2006 while he was a two - time world champion at @entity91 , and was runner - up the year before and then again in 2007 in his only season at @entity52			1
" it 's always nice to come to @entity23 , an historic track for @entity5 and for @entity29 , which took its first championship race win here 60 years ago , " the @entity94 said			1
" i like the new paddock , the only strange thing is the final part of the pit lane , which is lower than the track -- which means the spectators can not see the pit stops from the grandstands			0
" the rain definitely did not help on a day that was meant to allow us mainly to test the new aerodynamic components we have here			0
only at the end of the first session did i risk trying a set of slicks to see if the conditions were acceptable , but the track was still too wet			2

@entity5 drivers *unsure* of likely effects of rule changes after wet weather hampers practice
@entity25 's @entity24 , who won @entity3 *gp* in 2010 , set fastest time of day in opening session
@entity29 's @entity28 quickest in afternoon , three seconds slower than @entity24
