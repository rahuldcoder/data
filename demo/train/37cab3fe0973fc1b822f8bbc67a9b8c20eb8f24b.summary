@entity0 -- prime minister @entity3 's party got the most votes in @entity6 's national election tuesday , but a respectable showing by centrists could slow or halt a rightward swing in the government			1
@entity3 's @entity11 won between 31 and 33 @entity13 seats in the @entity6 election , tv exit polls reported , winning the most , as expected			1
@entity16 , an extreme right party with a charismatic leader named @entity18 , got between 11 and 12 seats			1
but the @entity22 party , a new centrist movement devoted to helping the middle class and halting military draft exemptions for @entity26 civilians , came in a surprising second place with at least 18 seats , according to the exit polls			1
@entity3 told weary but elated supporters early wednesday he plans to form a government " as broad as possible " and pursue his goals with " many partners			1
" " i believe the results of the election represent an opportunity to make changes that the people of @entity6 want to see and that will serve all citizens of the state of @entity6 , " he said			0
" i plan to lead those changes and to that end we must establish a government that is as broad as possible , and i 've already started out on that task			2
" he cited a number of principles a new government will embrace : security , preventing @entity49 from obtaining nuclear weapons , economic responsibility in the face of the global financial crisis , increasing equality in sharing burdens and lowering the cost of living , including the cost of apartments			2
@entity6 defies international criticism of settlement plans " it is a great privilege but it is also a great responsibility , " @entity3 said			1
" i believe the results of the elections represent an opportunity to make changes that the people of @entity6 want to see and ( that ) will serve all of the citizens of the state of @entity6			0
" but the centrists and leftists attracted waves of voters displeased with , among other things , @entity6 's high cost of living , and more supportive of talks with @entity74			1
at first glance , the initial result reflects a politically polarized electorate , with possibly an edge to the rightists			0
@entity80 , a politician who is staunchly in the peace camp and one of the chief architects of the @entity6 - @entity74 peace initiative called the @entity85 , said he thinks that it will be impossible for @entity3 to form his own government and he hopes none of the center - left parties join his government			1
" the center - left in @entity6 is alive and kicking			0
it 's almost the majority , or half and half , " he told @entity1			2
" all the talks about the demise of the left are over for the time being			0
" @entity22 's leader is a dynamic figure -- @entity101 , a longtime prominent journalist whose late father , @entity102 , led @entity103 , a onetime secularist party that took on the influence and power of the @entity26			1
@entity22 also calls for reforming the governmental system , improving education , jump - starting the economy through small - business assistance and providing housing assistance for military veterans and young couples			1
the @entity114 , whose leader @entity115 campaigned solely on economic concerns , apparently won 17 seats , according to exit polling			1
before the election , she was expected to finish in second place , so that is a surprise			0
she and other centrists were working to tap into the disaffected @entity6 who took to the @entity127 streets in 2011 to protest frustrating economic conditions			2
@entity129 , the party of former foreign minister @entity131 , who is focused on talks with @entity74 , gained seven seats			1
another poll says @entity135 , a longtime left - wing party , gained at least five seats			1
" politics is often about expectations , " said @entity138 , an @entity6 analyst at the the @entity139			0
" once the public thought that @entity3 was a shoo - in , it assumed his victory and looked for a fresh face that would be focused on issues that he has not prioritized			1
this explains the meteoric rise of a new party ( @entity22 ) which said it would focus on the middle class and find a way so the @entity26 participate in burden - sharing by joining either the compulsory army or civilian form of mandatory service			1
" one party in @entity6 never gets a parliamentary majority of more than 60 seats , so parties must rely on coalition - building			2
the question is whether @entity3 will stay on the right or move to the center			1
will @entity3 form a right - wing coalition with @entity16 and religious blocs such as @entity167 -- which earned between 11 and 13 seats , exit polls show ? or will he move to the center and try to form a coalition with @entity22 , for example , and others ? or is it possible that a center - left coalition could be cobbled together , without the right wing ? @entity3 and his party sensed @entity22 's momentum			1
he called on his backers to come out and vote			0
" the @entity11 government is in danger , go vote for us for the sake of the country 's future , " he was quoted as saying			2
opinion : do n't expect an @entity187 - @entity3 blowup after the exit polls rolled in , @entity3 thanked @entity6 on @entity189 for his showing and indicated that he wants to " a very wide government " as the hard work of coalition building begins on wednesday			1
" the ( election ) results observed are a great opportunity for many changes for the benefit of all citizens of @entity6			0
the complications ahead of us are many and wide , as from tonight i will start my efforts to form a very wide government as possible			2
" @entity204 , managing director at the @entity206 institute , said the result reflects polarized politics in @entity6			0
the immediate consequences of the result is that coalition building will be quite difficult and time - consuming , he said			0
the worst - case scenario would be government paralysis and maybe another election sooner rather than later			2
while he said it 's possible that a centrist coalition led by @entity22 , which means " there is a future , " and @entity114 could emerge , @entity204 thinks @entity3 and @entity102 will form a government			1
@entity11 celebrated after the results came in			0
@entity221 , a @entity11 party member expected to serve in the next @entity13 , was asked why the @entity6 - @entity74 peace process has n't been front and center in the campaign			2
both talks and the issue of @entity49 were not as prominent among factors as expected by many observers			0
domestic issues , in contrast , played a large role in the campaign			0
@entity6 has no partner among @entity74 , @entity221 said , and noted that peace initiatives have been tried but have n't borne fruit			0
he cited the situation in @entity238 , where militants fire missiles into @entity6 despite the country 's departure from that @entity74 territory			0
@entity6 launched an offensive against @entity74 militants in @entity238 last year after enduring missile fire on its territory			0
the next government , he said , will reach out to @entity74 " but will also continue to make sure @entity6 are strong and safe			0
" @entity6 does n't " want to see an @entity251 state in our backyard , " @entity221 said			0
@entity138 said the election is good news for the @entity187 administration , which has had prickly relations with the right - wing @entity3 government			1
it comes after a high turnout -- the percentage of eligible voters who cast a vote was 66.6 % , just 1 % more than the 2009 election			0
" it 's unclear if @entity3 wanted a pure right - wing option in the first place , " he said			1
" but @entity206 can breathe a sigh of relief that @entity3 will need to reach accommodation with some parties at the center of the map who essentially would like to see progress on the @entity74 issue as well as on economic issues			2
" @entity1 's @entity280 reported from @entity281			0
@entity1 's @entity282 , @entity283 and @entity284 reported from @entity6 .			0

@entity3 's party wins but the centrists do well , exit polls show
will the new government be more centrist or move right ?
@entity22 comes in second , @entity114 third , exit polling says
far right @entity16 home gets 12 seats
