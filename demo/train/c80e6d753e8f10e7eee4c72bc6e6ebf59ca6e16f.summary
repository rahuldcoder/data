-- @entity1 reached their third semifinal under @entity3 , and their 18th in the @entity5 era , despite losing the second leg of their @entity8 quarterfinal to @entity9 3 - 2			1
thanks to their 3 - 1 victory in the first leg though , the @entity10 stay on course to add the continent 's second tier title to the @entity18 crown they so famously won last may			1
swiftly after the match , @entity3 's thoughts immediately turned to sunday 's @entity22 semifinal clash with @entity23 at @entity24			0
the @entity25 , whose @entity27 tenure has been fraught with tension given his difficult relationship with @entity1 fans , knows he has already taken charge of one semifinal with the @entity10 -- one which ended in disappointing @entity36 defeat to @entity37			0
" it does n't too matter too much [ about the result ] , " @entity3 told @entity39 television after the match in @entity41			0
" there were circumstances such as the pitch , so it was a professional job and i was pleased with the players ' effort			0
" we are pleased to get through , but a little disappointed because we could have done a little better in defense , but the main thing was to progress			0
" we have to manage both games in the @entity8 and @entity22			0
some of them will not play on sunday but we can carry on in different competitions , which is good for the squad			0
" the success capped a triumphant return to the artificial surface of the @entity60 , where @entity1 lost the 2008 @entity18 final to @entity62 , after @entity9 were forced to play away from home given concerns over the state of their stadium			2
@entity1 will discover their opponents in the last four on friday , when @entity71 body @entity69 conducts the draw for both the @entity8 and @entity18			2
thursday proved a mixed night for @entity74 clubs , with @entity75 exiting at the hands of @entity77 , with the @entity79 side tipped by many to win the competition , while @entity82 were knocked out by @entity83			1
playing at home and trailing 3 - 1 from the first leg , the @entity84 made a late breakthrough through @entity88 and had a shot at glory only for substitute @entity91 to fire over with time running out			1
in stoppage time , @entity92 finished off a slick counterattack to ensure the @entity95 progressed and stamped their authority on the 4 - 2 aggregate scoreline			1
@entity98 side @entity83 , meanwhile , held their nerve to win a penalty shootout 4 - 1 after the tie had ended 4 - 4 on aggregate , with @entity82 holding the home side to a 2 - 2 draw			1
after @entity105 was sent off late on for the visitors , @entity82 seemed to believe a shootout was their best chance of victory - but @entity83 were flawless from 12 yards and reached their first @entity71 semifinal in the 120th year of the club 's existence			1
a similar fate befell @entity114 , who took a 2 - 0 lead to a deserted @entity117 in @entity118 , where they faced a @entity121 side playing behind closed doors as punishment for their supporters ' poor record on racism			2
the home side struggled to find a breakthrough until @entity130 scored on the hour mark but shortly after , @entity132 equalized to mark an historic chapter for a @entity135 club founded in 1907 .			0

@entity1 reach second *straight* @entity71 semi despite losing 3 - 2 in @entity138 to @entity9
