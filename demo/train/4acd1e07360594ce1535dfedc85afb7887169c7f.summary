-- in the sparse hinterland of @entity3 's southernmost nation plans are afoot to boldly take the continent where it has never gone before -- the deepest reaches of outer space			1
it 's here , in @entity3 's @entity10 desert , that construction is scheduled to begin on the @entity12 , a cluster of 3,000 satellites working in tandem over a square kilometer area			1
this highly sensitive collective of dishes and antennas will combine to act as a giant radio telescope -- the biggest in the world when built , according to the @entity22 -- probing the dark heart of space			1
an accompanying selection of array and aperture antennas , meanwhile , will provide continuous coverage of radio waves between 70 @entity30 and @entity31 that penetrate the earth 's atmosphere			2
scientists hope the project will shed further light on the mysteries posed by the likes of quasars , dark matter and black holes			0
according to @entity43 , director - general of the @entity44 , the project could even enable scientists to " pick up signals from extraterrestrials " should they exist , although this is n't the projects primary objective			2
there 's also the exciting possibility of capturing information on how the universe evolved in its earliest moments			0
the space effect for science , the prize is clearly huge			0
a full budget for the @entity12 is yet to be confirmed but construction is slated to begin by 2018			2
given the scale of the project , which has the backing of 11 member countries , some have even dubbed the @entity12 astronomy 's version of the @entity66			1
for @entity3 and the wider @entity69 continent , there are also many ancillary benefits			1
the @entity12 -- an international affair -- is headquartered in the @entity72 with the telescope itself planned for a " dual site " location in @entity75 and @entity3			1
distant stations will also be set up in @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 and @entity85			0
@entity12 @entity3 is also building the @entity87 radio telescope , which will act as a precursor to the ska and later be integrated into the larger telescope			1
the construction , observation and upkeep of these facilities will provide skilled jobs for local people			0
@entity12 @entity3 project director @entity96 , meanwhile , says that the telescope array will generate more data in a day than already exists on the entire internet			1
as such , new computer software and programs that can pinpoint relevant data and allow humans to interact with it in a simple and time - efficient manner are currently being developed			2
given the increasing importance of " big data " collection and analysis across a host of contemporary industries , @entity3 's government is taking a calculated risk that the technologies underpinning these systems will find further commercial use both in @entity3 and beyond			1
economic benefits for the @entity119 , these are clearly exciting and potentially lucrative developments to be a part of			1
" @entity3 wants to move away from being resource heavy economy to bring young people into science and technology , " explains @entity96			2
" building the @entity12 ... is a way of emphasizing and getting people to accept that science and tech is a key part of development			2
" this is a point of view that dr @entity135 , head of the @entity136 , strongly concurs with			0
he points to successful @entity136 programs currently underway -- including the development and launch of satellites that provide data used to inform government decisions on security , agriculture and environmental protection -- which prove the benefits of serious investment in a modern space program			1
the agency also gave help to @entity153 's @entity152 during launch in 2011			0
" ( there are ) endless possibilities through innovation and new technologies , which may be replicated on earth , " @entity135 says			0
" the necessary knowledge and skills developed through such missions will open doors for our people to position themselves equally on the global space stage and even bring in external funding to our countries thus boosting the economies , " he adds			0
the @entity69 space race @entity3 is n't the only @entity69 nation thinking along these lines			1
@entity173 , @entity174 , @entity175 , @entity176 and @entity177 have all established space and satellite programs with similar aims			0
@entity85 , @entity181 , @entity182 , @entity183 and @entity79 , meanwhile , have voiced their commitment to follow suit			0
some observers question whether the underlying infrastructure to enable these ambitions to flourish in the long term is currently in place			0
@entity192 , a @entity193 professor and co-chair of the @entity195 's @entity196 , told @entity0 that while it is right that @entity69 nations invest in space technology they must do so in a thoughtful and strategic manner			1
he points to the importance of focusing on education and inspiring future generations to become scientists and engineers , to create valuable and highly skilled workforces			0
" what we do n't want is vanity space programs , " @entity192 said			1
" as it stands , i think they are focusing more on the space programs and less on the education ... ( space programs ) have to be designed as a capability program otherwise the economic return will not be fully realized			1
" while this may be the case for some @entity69 nations , @entity96 says that since 2005 @entity3 has issued some 600 grants in their human capacity development program , covering " everything from research chairs down to artisan training			1
" " we 're putting a lot of young people through a pipeline where we 're trying to take them into astronomy and physics or engineering in their first or second year of university and taking them all the way through to post-doctoral fellowships			0
that 's starting to work quite well , " adds @entity96			0
aid and space despite his concerns about infrastructure , @entity192 is enthusiastic about the broader aims of developing space programs on the continent			1
there are others , however , who say that @entity69 nations should focus more on providing for the basic needs of their populations than on the luxury of space investment			1
@entity3 has one of the largest gaps between rich and poor globally , with millions living in shanty towns -- although earlier this year , the government reported that the population living in extreme poverty has dropped by 2.4 million since 2006			2
@entity177 has been wracked by political instability and violence since former president of 30 years , @entity261 was forced to resign by protesters in 2011 and the subsequent overthrow in 2013 of president @entity267 in a military coup			0
and in @entity173 , some regions boast the unenviable record of having 60 % of their population living in extreme poverty			0
@entity273 from the @entity275 body was quoted by the @entity72 's independent newspaper in 2013 asking why his country was sending money to provide development assistance to nations like @entity173 and @entity3 when they are investing in space technologies			1
" if a foreign government has enough cash to invest in an ambitious space program , it should not expect to be receiving cash from the @entity72 , " @entity273 said			2
colonial thinking the likes of @entity135 and @entity96 , however , have little time for these suggestions			0
" this is an argument we hear often and is largely as a result of the public not being able to make the link between the benefits of space investment against addressing society 's needs , " @entity135 says			2
" @entity3 has immense challenges with poverty , hunger and access to potable water which can all be diminished through investment in space " by providing valuable data that can make public policy more efficient , for example			2
on top of this , " innovations that arise from the ' out - of - the - box ' thinking that space encourages will impact on growing local economies and create opportunities for @entity69 in the global market , " he adds			1
@entity96 , however , is more withering in his riposte			0
" we do n't accept that @entity3 has to remain on the edge of civilization			0
that we do n't accept , that 's the old colonial way of thinking , " @entity96 says			0
" for @entity3 and @entity69 ( this could be ) the next great economic growth story , " he adds			1
" we will play a role in the future			0

the @entity12 is an ambitious radio telescope project
much of it will be based in @entity3 -- and other @entity69 nations
@entity3 's space agency hopes @entity12 will have knock - on economic benefits
