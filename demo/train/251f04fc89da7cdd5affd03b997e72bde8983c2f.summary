-- twenty - six years ago this week , a botched reactor safety test in a corner of what was then the @entity4 set off the worst nuclear accident in history			1
the radiation effects of the april 26 , 1986 , reactor explosion were about 400 times more potent than the bomb dropped on @entity10 during @entity11 , and nearly 14 times greater than the disaster last year at the @entity14 plant in @entity15			1
fast forward to today , and even in the exclusion zone , plants have re-grown , animals are flourishing and @entity19 has been opened to tourists			0
but @entity19 refuses to be relegated to the past			0
indeed it may still be devastating the lives of millions who continue to live in the fallout zone			1
aside from the potential health hazards of living in an area contaminated with radiation , domino socioeconomic effects have caused multiple problems in these regions			2
@entity32 , or @entity33 , works to help kids in the region whose lives have been impacted by a disaster that happened years before they were born			1
many suffer from physical problems such as congenital heart defects			0
many kids have chronic illnesses or disabilities , and many live full time in institutions			0
to help them , @entity33 sends surgical teams who in turn help train local doctors			1
@entity33 nurses teach institution staff techniques , and volunteers renovate facilities			1
one of @entity33 's main goals going forward is a program they call " @entity57 , " which uses money from donations to place institutionalized kids with nearby families			1
for many severely disabled children there , the future is uncertain			2
@entity33 works to build community centers in affected areas , in the hopes that there will be some support system for them after they are too old to remain in institutions			1
decades after the meltdown , the mission of @entity33 is complicated by the fact that there is no real consensus on how many of the region 's current problems can be directly attributed to @entity19			1
only 30 people died in the immediate aftermath , either from the explosion or acute radiation syndrome			2
but the disaster sent a cloud of radioactive fallout over hundreds of thousands of square miles of what is now @entity88 , @entity89 and @entity90 that would have an impact on the health of many more			1
more than 200,000 people were evacuated , never to return			2
however , a 2005 report by " the @entity96 " ( the most comprehensive to date ) estimated more than 5 million remain in what have been termed " contaminated territories , " and a quarter - million live in " highly contaminated territories			1
" ten years after the explosion , a @entity0 team visited @entity19 to ascertain the long - term effects of radiation exposure for those living near @entity19 during the accident , for cleanup workers or " liquidators , " or for those who continued to live in areas that were classified as polluted			2
they found more questions than answers			0
economies of affected countries were decimated by the disaster and by the subsequent breakup of the @entity4			1
years later , there are n't many more definitive answers than there were then , to the question of how exactly @entity19 has affected the lives , not just of those who lived through it , but of subsequent generations still living in these " contaminated ' areas " many of us have certain mental images that spring to mind when thinking of the effects of radioactive contamination : mutated animals , children with deformities and birth defects , for example			1
but the 2005 @entity96 report found scant evidence that this was the case			0
in fact , other than a marked increase in thyroid cancers in those living near the exclusion zone , the report found few definitive links to increased instances of disease or birth defects			0
their conclusion ; in the 600,000 people they studied , they might expect around 4,000 extra deaths that could be directly linked to @entity19			2
the report created fierce debate among some who felt it grossly underestimated the impact of the disaster			2
a subsequent study titled " @entity160 , " commissioned by the @entity161 , put the number of extra cancer deaths alone at a much higher rate -- somewhere between 30,000 and 60,000			0
figures released by @entity166 in 2010 showed that more than 20 % of adolescent children in @entity89 suffered from disabilities and chronic illness			2
@entity89 absorbed 70 % of @entity19 's fallout			2
but the truth is , no one really knows where to lay the blame for these figures			0
one of the main challenges for anyone attempting to ascertain the health effects of @entity19 radiation is that there is so much background radiation in the atmosphere to begin with			0
but more specifically , @entity19 was so much more than an explosion			0
" when we think about @entity19 , most people think about the medical consequences of living with radiation , " said @entity183 , a spokesperson for @entity184 ( @entity33 )			1
" but it 's important to understand that people are still being affected by the social and economic fallout			1
" after the @entity19 , millions living on previously prime farmland found that no one would import their " contaminated " produce			2
the high cost of cleanup from the accident , which cost @entity89 alone well over $ 200 billion , is thought to have contributed to the breakup of the @entity4 and further crippled affected region 's economy			2
with diminished ways to make a living , many were -- and still are -- forced to eat food and drink water from the polluted areas where they live			0
whether radiation in produce is or is not harmful , what 's certain is malnutrition is common , which often can result in illnesses and birth defects			0
another factor is a sense of defeatism in @entity19 - affected people , many of whom had to leave homes their families had lived in for generations			1
the @entity225 ( @entity225 ) says displacement , poverty and fear of radiation sickness have contributed to " suicides , drinking problems and apathy			0
" it 's issues like these -- prenatal alcohol exposure for example -- that have led to birth defects and illnesses in many children			0
as a result , many children live in institutions ; @entity166 estimates the number in @entity89 alone to be nearly 10,000			0
" the children in many cases were removed from their home ... because the parents might have had issues with alcoholism or with poverty , " @entity244 said			0
according to @entity33 , many kids suffer almost as much from being in an institution as they do from their disability or illness			1
@entity256 , communications officer from @entity166 , said that finding an alternative to institutions is a worldwide priority for them			0
" it can be impersonal , " she said			0
" they 're not getting the dedicated services they need , not having enough access to proper food or physical activity			0
" the question now , is how populations can begin to move on from the specter of @entity19 ? reports by the @entity272 on the @entity273 ( @entity274 ) and the @entity275 claim that much of the land designated as " contaminated " by the @entity277 actually contains radiation levels not much higher than vast areas considered " safe			1
" in fact , by the @entity4 's standards , it 's not just the former @entity4 republics that should be concerned			0
. " some 45,000 square kilometers in @entity285 have measurable levels of radioactivity in the soil from @entity19 above the criterion applied in the @entity277 to designate ' contaminated ' areas , " said @entity274 secretary @entity284			1
and yet , those areas have experienced nowhere near the alienation and economic impact of much of @entity89 and @entity90			1
how many areas are still " contaminated , " and what does that mean ? does lingering radiation adversely affect the health of residents , and is there still a danger from eating food grown there ? these are questions that many not have answers to for some time to come			1
in the meantime , a priority for @entity33 volunteers is simply to spend time with the kids , hug them , show them some love , and help them look forward to some kind of future -- whatever their link to the explosion that so altered their past			1
" we 're not scientists ; we 're humanitarians , " @entity244 said			0
" we just do n't want these people to be forgotten			0

a botched reactor safety test set off the worst nuclear disaster in history in 1986
about 5 million people remain in what have been termed ' contaminated territories '
@entity183 : " people are still being affected by the social and economic fallout . "
