the federal agency lifted its warning about tomatoes but left in place a warning about raw jalape単o and serrano peppers , having previously said those foods also may be linked to the outbreak			1
the source of the outbreak still is n't known -- and 20 to 30 reports of the illness are coming in per day -- but the @entity1 said the epidemic is " waning			1
" the @entity1 has n't determined whether tomatoes were a source of the outbreak , but it has determined that tomatoes currently in fields and stores are safe , said dr. @entity26 , the @entity1 's associate commissioner for food protection , according to @entity28			1
@entity29 -- a rare form of the bacteria -- has infected more than 1,190 people in 42 states , the @entity33 and @entity7 since april , according to the @entity34			2

at least 224 people have been hospitalized			2
two elderly men with pre-existing conditions died while infected with @entity29 , and the @entity1 said the infection could have contributed to their deaths			1
investigators initially thought that certain types of tomatoes were the source of the outbreak , and further investigation also cast suspicions on raw jalape単o and serrano peppers			1
samonella sleuths still on the trail many of the infected people were thought to have eaten tomatoes from farms in south @entity54 and parts of @entity56 , but inspectors have n't found the outbreak strain on those farms , @entity26 said , according to the @entity28 the scare prompted grocery chains nationwide to pull tomatoes from their shelves and some restaurants to stop offering them as ingredients			1

federal health investigators have visited farms in @entity54 , @entity72 and @entity56 to try to determine the source of the outbreak , according to the @entity34			2
