@entity0 , @entity1 -- the first time i suggested shaving off all my hair and becoming a monk , nobody batted an eyelid			1
in @entity1 , it is perfectly normal for people to go into monasteries or nunneries for temporary periods			1
the monastic system is a revolving door , and most of the country 's 55 million @entity17 , whether rich or poor , go in and out of it several times during their lives			1
what made the situation complicated was that i was a westerner and it was 2002 , a time when @entity1 , which is also known as @entity1 , was still a pariah state and branded an " outpost of tyranny " by the government of former @entity27 president @entity26			1
foreigners then were viewed with suspicion , and arranging to enter the forest retreat of @entity0 , one of the most traditional of the country 's monasteries , took some string - pulling			1
i eventually found myself shaved and robed and sitting in the little hut that would be my home for the next six weeks			2
the traditional period for temporary monkhood in @entity1 is only nine days , and i was wondering whether i had bitten off more than i could chew			1
i slept on a pillowless wooden board , and my morning began at 3.30 a.m. with an icy bucket shower and the scrape of a razor over chin and head			2
i then meditated with the other monks for two hours before a breakfast of rice and dal -- a stew of pulses such as lentils and beans -- at dawn			2
after that , it was back to the mediation hall until 10.30 a.m. when the second and final meal of the day was served			2
we were permitted to take a nap through the heat of midday before meditating again until around 7 p.m. as an atheist i became attracted to @entity17 in @entity1 because its monasteries have very little to do with ritual or theology			1
all of the emphasis is on practical techniques for uncovering the hidden workings of the mind			1
if a person wants to know what makes them tick , the techniques learned in @entity17 offer a powerful alternative to the hourly fees and drug prescriptions of @entity77 psychiatry			1
but the process is difficult and it can only be faced alone			2
i was not allowed to speak to anyone in the monastery , even to exchange a greeting			1
when meditating i was encouraged to carefully observe every thought , every breath , every feeling			2
even at meals , i had to be aware of each tiny thing -- the intention to move my fork , the movements of my jaws , my reactions to the flavors of the food			2
at the beginning all of this seemed virtually impossible , but after ten days of it my mind began to slow down and settle			0
now i was able to see not only my thoughts , but also the subconscious feelings and desires that produced them			0
soon i began to experience a feeling of serenity and mental clarity that i had not thought possible			0
in 2002 , international sanctions were hitting @entity1 's economy hard			1
donations of food to the monasteries , though regular , were not large			1
i was regularly sent out with a group of monks to collect alms			0
we went barefoot on the jungle trails , halting occasionally for villagers to drop handfuls of rice into our begging bowls			0
on one round i felt bad when a poor farmer gave me a few peanuts from his lunchbox , and at the end of my stay i mentioned this to the abbot			0
" do n't be so egotistical , " he rebuked me			0
" that man was not donating food to you personally , he saw only a monk standing there			1
one day soon , your positions will be reversed			0
he will be the monk seeking self - knowledge and you will be the donor who gives him food			1
if you have more than he has , then you can give more to equal his gift of peanuts			0
" and that is what makes the monastic system work so effectively in @entity1			1
among monks , there are no economic or class divisions			0
the identical robes , the communal dining and the head shaving are all there to emphasize the equality that exists between them			0
but when temporary monks return to their lives outside , some are suddenly far more equal than others			0
and so villagers donate a handful of rice , while city professionals donate breakfast and lunch for the entire monastery , or a water purification system , or even a new dining hall			2
when i returned to @entity1 this year for my second 45 - day stint as a monk , the ramped - up scale of these elite donations was very much in evidence			1
since the reforms begun by president @entity173 in 2011 , the country 's economy has grown at breakneck speed and the monasteries have grown along with it			2
@entity0 's forest retreat was three times larger than i remembered , and is now surrounded by beautiful gardens of flowers and fruit trees			0
i looked in vain for my rickety wooden hut , and was shown instead to a well - built brick bungalow with a hardwood floor , a fan , a comfortable bed and a @entity77 - style bathroom with a shower			0
there were spacious new meditation halls , a clinic and a library			0
every day saw visits by city donors bringing varied and nutritious meals for monks of every social background			0
the population of the monastery also reflected @entity1 's new openness to the world			1
although i was still the only westerner , i now found myself among monks from @entity204 , @entity205 , @entity206 , @entity207 and @entity208			0
one monk from the city of @entity211 in southern @entity208 turned out to be leaving the same day as me			2
after our disrobing ceremony , i asked him why he had traveled here			0
" in @entity208 , we are not free to practice our religion , " he told me			0
" all @entity208 @entity17 want to come here			1
we think of @entity1 as a place of freedom			1
" @entity218 author and art historian @entity219 has twice been ordained as a @entity221 monk in @entity1 -- once in 2002 and once in 2013			1
