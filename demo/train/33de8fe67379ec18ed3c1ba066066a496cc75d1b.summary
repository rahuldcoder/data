-- in all the toing and froing that we have seen in recent weeks surrounding match - fixing -- the @entity6 press conference that announced more than 680 suspicious football matches worldwide and the banning of 33 players and officials for life in @entity12 -- one question has been largely overlooked : just how do you actually fix a football game ? after all , football is not a sport like cricket with stops and starts			1
it 's a team game with an ebb and flow that should make it very difficult to fix			2
but according to the @entity27 police investigators , the fixers and dodgy sporting people were able to successfully manipulate hundreds of games -- so how did they actually arrange these corrupted matches ? in essence , there are three ways and the first is the old stand - by of a dodgy referee			1
there have always been officials who are willing to corrupt matches			1
i showed in my book " @entity40 : @entity41 , " that there is a long tradition in some countries of clubs providing referees with sexual bribes before matches : good - looking young women who suddenly found the men in black irresistibly attractive			1
the next morning , club officials would drop a gentle word about ' " ocal hospitality " and the official , who was often married , knew that they had to provide a " well - refereed " match for the host team			1
the problem with that method is that it is very difficult for referees to deliver a fixed match			1
they can give away needless penalties and red cards , but in the end their capacity to actually affect a match is limited			1
a second method is gathering four or five players in a team to throw a match			1
the advantage to this scam is that it actually makes identifying a fix very difficult for a spectator			2
you have six players running around trying as hard as they can ; and you have five players pretending to run around trying as hard as they can			2
this way an outsider finds it extraordinarily difficult to figure out what is going on			2
all they see is 11 players who may or may not be making mistakes honestly			0
all of whom are swearing and cursing the moment anything goes wrong			0
who is on the fix or even if there is a fix occurring is very difficult to tell			0
the most pernicious method , and most effective , is when a fixer can get a club owner to fix matches			1
the @entity6 investigators spoke about this during their conference			1
there are dodgy club owners in @entity27 who will begin a season by looking at the 40 or so games in the league , and think , " right we will try to win these 30 matches , and we will lose these 10			1
" morally it is a terrible thing to do			0
financially , however , it makes excellent sense			0
knowing that they will lose those specific 10 matches , the club owners will bet against their team and make more money losing those matches , then in winning all the other games			1
last year @entity113 , the umbrella group of professional footballers ' unions , conducted a survey where they spoke to over 3,000 @entity27 players about their working conditions and the possibility of corruption in the sport			0
the results were so shocking that @entity113 entitled the results of their survey " @entity125			0
" in the report , players spoke frequently of intimidation and threats to ensure that entire teams fixed matches			2
and that intimidation was often coming from the owners of the teams			0
if corruption exists at a club , it makes it very easy to fix a match			2
a club owner simply has to walk into a dressing room and say , " right , lads			0
today , you will lose the match			2
if you do not lose you will not get your salary for the last few months			0
" in those cases , all the players have to do is make sure the spectators do not notice and they have a successful fix			0
all this is not to say that every game is fixed			0
the situation is far better in @entity27 then @entity151			0
in that continent , there are entire leagues like - the @entity12 and @entity155 -- that have had to be shut down for months while mass arrests were conducted before the sports could continue			1
it is to say , though , that unless serious measures are taken the world 's game will be very , very badly affected .			0
