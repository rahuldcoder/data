@entity0 , @entity1 -- behind high , whitewashed walls in the middle of dusty , noisy @entity0 is a sacred place respected by all who come through its gates			1
many who enter are unable to walk into the compound , which was built as a kindergarten by the occupying @entity13 back in the 1970s			0
instead , the majority of the men , women and children are carried in on stretchers from the back of ambulances -- their bloodied bodies riddled with bullets and shrapnel ; their flesh and organs ripped apart by rockets and machine gun fire			1
and while most are innocent victims , caught in the middle of @entity1 's ongoing war against the @entity33 insurgency , some of the patients are responsible for the pain and trauma that is being treated			1
this is @entity37 -- an international @entity38 run predominantly by @entity39 -- and it treats all victims of war			1
teenage victims on the afternoon we arrive to watch @entity45 and its staff in action , two teenage boys are rushed in from @entity48 in @entity49 -- a @entity33 stronghold where some of the worst fighting takes place each day			1
@entity53 , who is only 15 , lies motionless in the ambulance -- part of his jaw has been blown off and he 's lost a lot of blood			1
he 's quickly wheeled into the emergency room where doctors and nursing staff immediately go into overdrive to keep him alive			1
on the bed next to him , his 13 - year - old cousin moans in pain			0
as a doctor removes the blood - soaked bandages wrapped around his right hand , blood gushes onto the floor from where his fingers once were			0
the boys had been herding sheep when they walked on a landmine -- a crude yet lethal device that 's responsible for at least half the injuries treated at @entity37			1
in less than 10 minutes , the boys are prepared for surgery and wheeled into the operating theater			0
despite the howls of agony , the torn flesh , mutilated limbs and @entity53 's life threatening injuries , the staff work quickly , calmly and professionally -- each highly skilled at their job , knowing exactly what they need to do to save lives			1
" this is nothing out of the ordinary , " explains @entity92			0
" this is what we do every single day			0
" twenty minutes later another ambulance arrives with more casualties of this war			2
business as usual in this bloody conflict			2
life - saving work @entity92 is one of a dozen @entity39 and foreigners committed to giving free and proper medical treatment to victims of conflict zones around the world			1
founded by @entity39 surgeon @entity109 , emergency was first set up in @entity110 in 1994			1
then in 1999 , @entity109 came to @entity1 , initially working with the @entity111 in the @entity112 , north of the capital , before receiving permission from the @entity33 , who were governing at the time , to set up @entity37 in @entity0 in 2000			1
through his life saving work , @entity109 and @entity45 pressured the @entity39 parliament to ban the production of landmines			1
a law that still stands today			0
inspired by his fellow countryman , @entity92 arrived in @entity0 five years ago with a plan to stay only six months			0
" it 's an amazing place , " he says			2
" very challenging but also very interesting			0
every year i say is the last year but it 's very difficult to leave			2
you get very connected to the place , the people and the hospital			0
" i ask @entity92 what he hates about his job			0
" seeing children injured , suffering , crying , " he replies without hesitation			2
" unfortunately we see a lot of suffering every day			0
but we also see a lot of resilience			0
@entity1 are very strong and they 're really hoping to have a better future			1
and while our statistics show a dramatic change and an increase in fighting ... i also think @entity1 people are tired of the conflict and they want peace			1
" dr. @entity149 -- a professor of @entity150 back in @entity39 -- has been volunteering his lifesaving skills since his first mission to @entity1 in 2009			1
he did the night shift and saw his last patient at 5 a.m. eight hours later he 's back in @entity155 treating patients who 've undergone serious trauma because of this seemingly endless war			1
he says he 's not suffering from the " help syndrome " but rather doing what he was trained to do in a country crying out for skilled medical professionals			2
fighting season " i 'm here because i 'm a doctor and i think that everybody needs help and here in @entity1 the help is very needed			1
" @entity149 says almost half the cases he sees are children -- blown up by landmines -- and the statistics are only going to get worse once fighting season gets underway with the arrival of the warmer weather			1
" i see so many children losing their limbs because of these landmines , " he says			2
" it 's hard enough for these people to live in this country , let alone as amputees			2
it 's such a tragic situation			0
" @entity37 's medical coordinator , @entity182 , jokes with the patients , especially the young ones , hoping to put a smile on their weary faces			1
but he admits the years of pain and suffering that he 's witnessed are starting to wear on him			0
" i hate when we ca n't do anything else , we ca n't make a difference because the patient is in too bad condition , " he says			0
" we all try but sometimes it 's not enough			0
" one patient in particular was seven - month - old @entity195			0
the baby boy was in his mother 's arms when they were caught in the middle of a firefight -- a bullet hit his spinal cord and the fracture led to meningitis			2
despite positive signs of improvement , the infant died two weeks later in the @entity210 ward surrounded by the staff who had lovingly cared for him			0
" that affected all of us , " says @entity182 with a heavy heart and a sigh			0
" we were so hopeful he was going to survive			0
but this is life in @entity1			2
" opinion : after @entity219 , @entity1 at perilous crossroads			2
