the mystery behind four days of unexplained shaking and odd sounds rattling @entity3 , @entity4 , has been solved			1
the cause ? a " swarm " of minor earthquakes amplified by the unique bedrock beneath the state of @entity4			1
the strange sounds -- variously described as rattling pipes , clanging metal , thunder or firecrackers -- have continued on and off since early sunday night in just one part of the small town of 4,600 , located about 180 miles northeast of @entity17			1
they were loud enough monday morning that a @entity20 journalist could hear them during a cell phone conversation with city administrator @entity23			0
speaking to @entity3 residents thursday night , @entity23 said the @entity25 has determined that " our community did in fact experience an earthquake that registered 1.5 on the earthquake magnitude scale			1
" that minor quake was measured on tuesday night by several mobile earthquake monitoring stations that were dispatched to the region , she said			1
based on all the data , the @entity25 believes the shaking and strange sounds are the result of " a swarm of several small earthquakes in a very short amount of time , " @entity23 said			1
while these small earthquakes normally do n't cause such commotion , @entity23 said the location of the shallow temblors helped amplify the shaking			2
" in other places in the @entity48 , a 1.5 earthquake would not be felt , " she said			1
" but the type of rock that @entity4 has transmits seismic energy very well			1
" when the shaking began last sunday , hundreds of residents began calling 911			1
@entity54 said she hear noises around midnight that sounded like a paintball gun			0
" it was just pop - pop - pop , " she said			0
" so i woke up -- just jumped out of bed actually -- ran downstairs , looked outside , nothing			0
since sunday , the shaking has happened nearly every night , quieting down during the day			1
absent of any explanations , residents were left to their own devices to come up with explanations			2
" my bet is on gremlins , " one @entity66 user jokingly posted to @entity68 's @entity66 page			2
alien machinery buried for millennia , countered another			0
no , said one one tongue - in - cheek @entity74 user			0
it 's clearly mole men launching their attack on the surface dwellers			2
others suggested huge earthworms or sewer cats			0
some @entity3 residents were even holding " shake " parties at night , waiting for the rumbling			1
as city officials ruled out electrical explosions , gas leaks and sewer collapses , they started consulting geological experts around the country			0
based on the data from eight seismic monitoring stations , @entity23 said the @entity25 finally determined on thursday that earthquakes were to blame			1
while the cause of the shaking has been solved , it 's still not clear if the rattling in @entity3 is over , @entity23 said			1
" there is no way to say for certain whether our area will ever again experience an earthquake , " she said			0
" but it still very likely , although not guaranteed , that any future earthquakes that we experience would again be on the low end of the earthquake magnitude scale			1
" tuesday 's 1.5 tremor is only the second recorded earthquake in @entity4 since 1947 , according to @entity25 geophysicist @entity111			1
the last quake happened south of @entity113 , and was too minor to record a definitive magnitude			2
@entity111 explained that the rock underneath @entity4 and in much of the country east of the @entity117 is " very consolidated " and without fault lines			2
and that means small quakes are actually felt by residents , unlike in @entity122 where the energy is absorbed			0
for example , the august earthquake in @entity125 that rattled @entity126 , was felt as far away as @entity128 and @entity129			0
" all throughout the eastern @entity48 , even small earthquakes are felt great distances , " @entity111 explained			0
" it 's because the rocks are just really old			0
they transmit the energy really well			0
" he said earthquake swarms are actually quite common in the region east of the @entity117			0
@entity111 said there was no hydraulic fracturing or " fracking " going on in @entity4 , a drilling process that some believe may have caused a series of quakes in @entity146 earlier this year			2
when asked why @entity3 residents heard such strange noises during the apparent quakes , @entity111 said all seismic shifts generate noise but these sounds can not be heard during major quakes			2
" when seismic waves travel through the ground , they 're moving ... faster than the speed of sound and when they hit the surface , " @entity111 explained			0
" ( it ) rattles the ground like a speaker ... so it 's common for people to hear what they describe as sonic boom sounds accompanying earthquakes			2
but usually when there 's a big earthquake , people either do n't hear the sounds because the frequency is lower than the threshold of what humans can hear			1
or other sounds going on ( like ) things falling down			0

residents of @entity4 town began reporting unexplained sounds sunday night
shaking or *vibrating* sensations accompany the sounds
@entity25 now says it 's the result of an earthquake " swarm "
it measured one quake with a 1.5 magnitude
