-- nearly 6,800 company - operated @entity2 stores in the @entity4 will begin accepting mobile payments wednesday			1
customers using the @entity8 app on their @entity9 , @entity10 or @entity11 will now be able to use those devices as tender			1
the nationwide rollout marks the official launch of the @entity8 payment program , which has been piloted at @entity18 stores and select @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity22 @entity2 locations			1
@entity8 lets users add their @entity24 , track rewards and reload cards as needed via @entity27 or credit card			1
to pay with their phone , app users simply select " touch to pay " and hold up the barcode on their mobile device screen to the 2 - @entity34 scanner at the register			2
an @entity38 application is also said to be in the works , but the company has yet to disclose a release date			0
@entity2 is using its own custom - built technology to enable the 2 - d mobile barcode scans			0
the coffee retailer opted for barcode scanning over near field communication technology -- which @entity47 is exploring -- because of its limited availability			0
the coffee retailer was reluctant to wait for a @entity51 ecosystem to develop when its customers have expressed interest in mobile payments now , according to @entity55 , the category manager of innovation on the @entity8 team			1
" once there are more users , we will adapt , " he says			0
in testing , @entity2 assessed the mobile payment option by measuring application speed , transaction speed and total customer wait time , says @entity66 , vice president of @entity8 and brand loyalty			2
in all instances , @entity8 was the fastest way for customers to pay			0
@entity2 is investing in mobile payments , an investment @entity55 describes as modest in relation to expectations , because customers have requested the option and have shown a propensity to not only pay with @entity24 -- one in five transactions are made using a @entity8 -- but frequently use their smartphones while waiting in line			1
the company also believes that its customers carry their mobile phones more often than a wallet or purse , and sees @entity8 and the mobile payment program as an opportunity to reach these consumers and build stronger relationships			2
@entity2 seems confident that its customers will appreciate the new , faster way to pay			0
both @entity55 and @entity66 believe that adoption will spread as customers tell their friends about the new mobile payment option			0
