-- of the four to five billion injections given each year in @entity2 , at least 2.5 billion are unsafe , according to one study			1
in some cases , that means they are administered using unsterilized second - hand syringes that could be contaminated with a blood - borne disease such as hepatitis or @entity10			1
a simple change to the way syringes are made could dramatically reduce those figures and save thousand of lives each year , according to @entity16 of @entity17 , in @entity18			1
his design for a new kind of syringe that changes color after it has been used was nominated for an index : award			1
" 1.3 million people ( globally ) a year die from unsafe injection practices , " @entity24 says , quoting @entity26 figures			0
" it accounts for over 30 % of hepatitis a and b cases and 5 % of @entity10 cases			0
" he explained that in @entity2 it is common for scavengers to hunt through landfill sites looking for old syringes that they can clean up and sell to clinics			1
" when you compare a sterile syringe just out of its packaging with a syringe that 's been washed , how do you determine the difference ? " he said			1
" we conceived an intelligent ink that , if exposed to air by taking it out of the package or if the package is breached that would activate it and turn it red			1
" read this : tiny computer takes prize at design awards the @entity57 is impregnated with an ink that 's sensitive to carbon dioxide and then sealed in a protective atmosphere so that it remains transparent until it is ready for use			1
after the seal is broken , the shell of the syringe starts to turn a dark red , alerting both doctors to the risk that the syringe may already have been used			2
@entity24 's intention is that the introduction of the @entity57 syringe should be accompanied by a public information campaign so that patients would also associate a red syringe with danger and would be able to insist on sterile equipment			2
" we had to be really quite clever in looking at technologies that cost next to nothing , and modified - air packaging is one of those technologies , " @entity24 said			0
" it only adds 1 % to the retail price , so on a two - and - a - half pence ( four cents ) syringe it becomes quite an interesting proposition			2
" according to @entity24 's calculations , if the @entity57 syringe is used for 5 % of injections administered in @entity2 , after five years it will have prevented more than 700,000 infections and saved $ 130 million in medical costs			1
watch this : life - saving device brings hope to @entity2 @entity95 , who works for the @entity26 's health systems and innovation taskforce , said the @entity57 could help to make injections safer			1
" anything that can contribute to decrease the reuse of syringes is worth considering and cost is certainly a major factor , " he said			2
" the great advantage of this concept is that not only health care workers but also patients can have a visual appreciation on the safety status of the device			0
in my view this could be a good deterrent for practitioners to reuse			0
" however , he noted that it would be possible for unscrupulous doctors to override the visual warning if their patients did not know the meaning of the color change			2
he also said that the one - minute delay before the syringe turned red may not be long enough			0
" how would you distinguish good and bad syringes if the injections are not practised inside this lap of time ? " he said			0
" it could create confusion and render the concept ineffective			0
" @entity132 , a member of the @entity134 jury and the managing director of @entity136 , an agency that aims to put creative ideas into practice , said that working with the international medical community would help to turn the prototype into a viable product			0
" this innovation speaks to the endless possibilities of design , creativity and innovation in addressing real - world issues , " he said			0
" in addition to being cost - effective , which will ensure the accessibility of the solution , it also allows patients to take charge of a critical issue â € ” great example of empowerment through smart design			0

scavengers in @entity2 clean old syringes from landfill sites and sell them to clinics
new syringe design changes color after use if it is contaminated
the ' intelligent ink ' is projected to prevent more than 700,000 infections in five years
