in a dramatic shift toward a major @entity4 ally , the @entity1 administration announced a suspension of significant military aid to @entity7 on wednesday over the bloody crackdown on the @entity9			1
the move , involving hundreds of millions in @entity12 assistance to the @entity7 military , is the culmination of months of debate within the administration about how to respond to the july 3 ouster of former president @entity17 , @entity7 's first democratically elected leader			1
" as a result of the review directed by president @entity1 , we have decided to maintain our relationship with the @entity7 government , while recalibrating our assistance to @entity7 to best advance our interests , " @entity19 spokeswoman @entity18 said in a statement			1
the @entity1 administration has still not labeled @entity17 's removal from office a coup			1
such a designation would require a cut in all but humanitarian aid , a step @entity1 has been reluctant to take			0
last month , the president 's top national security advisers recommended he cut most of the aid to the military			2
officials have said @entity40 wants to maintain its relationship with the @entity7 military and interim government , and the statement noted the @entity12 and @entity7 still " have a " longstanding partnership and many shared interests			1
" but after @entity12 calls for @entity7 military restraint over the past few months were met with a crackdown on @entity17 supporters , @entity1 canceled a joint military exercise and announced the review of all @entity12 aid to @entity7			1
death toll rises as violence rages on in @entity7 some military aid was suspended and military shipments from the @entity12 were slowed while the review was underway			1
the @entity12 will " continue to hold the delivery of certain large - scale military systems and cash assistance to the government pending credible progress toward an inclusive , democratically elected civilian government through free and fair elections , " @entity18 said in the statement			0
" the @entity12 continues to support a democratic transition and oppose violence as a means of resolving differences within @entity7 , " she added			2
senior administration officials briefed reporters on details of the decision			0
the @entity12 will halt a $ 260 million cash transfer to @entity7 and suspend large - scale military systems , like the f - 16 aircraft , @entity78 tank parts , @entity80 anti-ship missiles and @entity82 helicopters			1
some of the aid will be " repurposed " to benefit the @entity7 people			0
one of the officials said defense secretary @entity86 called @entity7 army chief gen. @entity87 to advise him of the decision			2
@entity89 told him the @entity12 would continue military training and education , a symbol of the long - term relationship			2
the aid cut is meant to be temporary with the hope that the @entity7 military will take steps toward restoring democracy			2
the @entity12 also plans to meet its commitments for @entity7 - related work being performed by contractors			2
non-military assistance for programs like health , education and private sector economic development programs will also continue , @entity18 said , adding that the @entity12 would put a premium on assistance going forward that " directly benefits the @entity7 people			2
" " the @entity12 wants to see @entity7 succeed , and we believe the @entity12 - @entity7 partnership will be strongest when @entity7 is represented by an inclusive , democratically elected civilian government based on the rule of law , fundamental freedoms and an open and competitive economy , " she said			2
the move does not include funding toward security in the @entity118 and along the @entity7 border with @entity120 , as well as assistance for counter-terrorism , @entity18 said			0
in september , an @entity7 court banned all activities of the @entity9 and froze its finances , drawing complaints from the international community			0
at the @entity129 , @entity7 's interim foreign minister sought to quell these concerns			1
@entity131 said @entity7 will hold elections in the spring			0
he also argued that the political process is open to all " as long as they are committed to the renunciation of violence and terrorism and acts of incitement to them			0
" but violence has continued throughout the country			0
dozens of people were killed last weekend when @entity9 supporters clashed with their opponents and security forces			0
the statement issued on wednesday suggested the move could be reversed if the govern0ment took steps to restore democracy			0
" we will continue to review the decisions regarding our assistance periodically and will continue to work with the interim government to help it move toward our shared goals in an atmosphere free of violence and intimidation , " @entity18 said			0
on tuesday , @entity161 sent a letter to @entity1 urging the @entity12 to not facilitate arms for @entity7			1
" the @entity12 government needs to stop providing arms or allowing back door sales of weapons or equipment that @entity7 's security forces will likely use to violate human rights , " @entity164 , the group 's deputy executive director , said			1
" before sales resume , @entity7 authorities must investigate and prosecute those responsible for recent incidents of excessive force			0
otherwise , the @entity1 administration will be giving a ' get out of jail free ' card to those who have violently suppressed peaceful protestors , " he said			1
@entity182 senior international correspondent @entity181 said in the short - term , the @entity12 decision could have a positive impact in @entity7			1
" immediately , probably , the @entity7 government is going to find it 's going to gain somewhat in terms of local public opinion , " @entity181 said			0
" @entity7 i 've already been in touch with about this decision or announcement from the @entity12 that it 's going to cut aid seem to react positively			1
there seems to be a lot of frustration with the @entity12 , given its role in @entity7 over the last two - and - a - half years since the revolution			2
" but do n't expect to see @entity7 's military hurting financially , @entity181 said			1
" for the @entity7 government , a cutoff in @entity12 aid is symbolically significant , but in terms of the actual amount of money they 're getting , it will not make a big difference , " he said			1
@entity181 said @entity207 states have been pouring billions into @entity7 since @entity17 's ouster			0
a move to cut off aid would likely anger those allies who have urged the @entity12 to support the military and warned against stopping assistance			1
sen. @entity215 , a @entity217 @entity216 who chairs the appropriations panel that funds @entity12 assistance to @entity7 , said federal law " is clear " and requires that aid be severed in the event of a coup			1
" rather than encourage reconciliation and restore democracy as it promised , the @entity7 military has reinstituted martial law and cracked down on the @entity230 opposition , which has also used violence , " he said in a statement			0
" the administration is trying to have it both ways , by suspending some aid but continuing other aid			0
by doing that , the message is muddled			0
if they want to continue aid to the @entity7 government they should ask @entity242 for a waiver			0

@entity1 administration decision is a dramatic shift toward a major @entity4 ally
the move responds to a military crackdown and involves hundreds of millions in aid
the @entity12 is not calling the ouster of @entity7 's president in july a coup
officials say @entity40 still wants to maintain its relationship with @entity7 's military
