-- @entity1 worldwide called for unity monday by singing the national anthem in unison -- a rare gesture in a continent facing violent uprisings for leaders to step down after decades in power			1
citizens in the nation and other parts of the world took a break at 1 p.m. @entity1 time ( 5 a.m. et ) to collectively sing the hymn			1
drivers pulled over on the side of the roads while crowds gathered at malls and busy intersections to sing the anthem			2
the singing drifted over the bustling capital of @entity26 , where lunchtime rush hour noise includes honking car horns and loud music blaring from stores			2
organizers said the grassroots effort is aimed at promoting unity in the east @entity35 nation , where ethnic violence left more than 1,000 people dead after disputed elections four years ago			2
" the whole point is to unite @entity1 in one action and provoke reflection about personal responsibility , " said organizer @entity39			1
" we decided to go with the national anthem because it is the main prayer that binds us together			1
it 's a clarion call that transcends all boundaries -- physical , mental , tribal , you name it			1
" @entity50 , 29 , crawled out of bed to join in the singing from the @entity54 suburb of @entity55			2
" at the very least , i hope singing the national anthem together jolts regular @entity1 into looking at the big picture , " @entity50 said			1
" ethnic and tribal differences are obsolete			0
instead of fighting amongst ourselves , we should be busy competing with the rest of the world			0
" the movement started on social media , and later expanded offline			0
it comes as much of @entity66 and the @entity67 -- including @entity68 and @entity69 -- are embroiled in violent protests demanding changes in leadership			2
uprisings in @entity74 and @entity75 have led to the toppling of long - term leaders after decades in power			1
however , the @entity1 effort is not an uprising , organizers said			1
" those nations are going through what we went through in 2002 , " @entity39 said , referring to the election of a new president after strongman @entity84 stepped down following 24 years in power			1
his retirement sent throngs of citizens dancing in the streets of the capital , @entity26			0
" we all have our different situations , " @entity39 said			0
" in a way , we are ahead of the game			0
we do n't have to deal with dictatorship , and i know a few years down the line , they will be done with regimes and calling for unity			0
" organizers say it will be an added bonus if it sends a warning to the government that the youth can organize without their help			0
" i hope it also lets them know that we can get together and intellectually influence each other , " said @entity109 , another organizer			0
@entity109 said that the movement is " simply a social cause " and not a call to arms			1
" our government may not be perfect , but at the very least , we are a democracy , " he said			0
@entity1 is @entity66 's largest economy and provides an important buffer of stability against the volatile @entity123 and @entity124			1
in 2007 , the nation 's disputed election sparked ethnic violence			0
it pitted supporters of incumbent president @entity130 against those of challenger @entity132 , who was later named prime minister in a power - sharing agreement			2
youth in the nation have turned to social media to call for an end to ethnic division , and demand reform and accountability from the government .			0
