@entity0 -- president @entity2 said tuesday his televised health care summit with @entity5 leaders on february 25 should involve true give - and - take negotiations instead of mere " political theater			1
" in a rare appearance at the daily @entity10 media briefing , @entity2 said he wants the meeting -- which also will include health care experts -- to " establish some common facts " on the health care issue and reach agreement on the most pressing health care problems facing the country			1
to signal his willingness to compromise , @entity2 said he would consider a @entity5 push to include limits on medical malpractice lawsuits in a health care bill if the proposal can be shown to truly reduce overall health care costs			1
the president acknowledged the issue could " make my party uncomfortable , " an apparent nod to traditional @entity31 support among trial lawyers who oppose such limits			0
however , @entity2 said bipartisanship on health care reform can not mean only that " democrats give up everything they believe in			1
" " bipartisanship depends on a willingness among both @entity31 and @entity5 to put aside matters of party for the good of the country , " he said			0
@entity2 's comments followed a meeting with top congressional leaders from both parties , the first since he pledged in last month 's @entity47 address to hold regular bipartisan talks			1
@entity5 leaders in the meeting later repeated their past insistence that the upcoming health care negotiations start from scratch , instead of building on separate @entity31 health care bills passed by the @entity10 and @entity56			1
" what we need to do is start over , go step - by - step on a truly bipartisan basis to try to reach an agreement , " senate minority leader @entity57 , @entity58 , told reporters			0
" my members are open to doing that			0
" @entity10 minority leader @entity66 , @entity67 , indicated he and other @entity5 chiefs are ready to attend the february 25 health care summit , but have questions for the @entity10 on the lineup and agenda for the meeting			1
@entity66 noted @entity5 leaders sent @entity10 chief of staff @entity75 a letter monday asking for details of the proposed talks			2
" the letter last night tried to understand what the purpose of the meeting is , " @entity66 said , adding : " if we 're truly going to have a bipartisan conversation , then let 's just scrap this bill that the @entity31 ca n't pass in the @entity10 or @entity56 and let 's start over on a real conversation about how to make the current system work better			0
" the half - day summit is an attempt by the @entity2 administration to rescue health care legislation , a top domestic priority for the president			1
televising it also would help fulfill a campaign promise by @entity2 that health care negotiations would be broadcast live			1
the planned talks with @entity5 are the first clear strategy by @entity2 and @entity31 on how to proceed on health care after losing their 60 - seat supermajority in the @entity56			1
@entity5 @entity105 was sworn in as the new @entity107 senator from @entity108 last week , leaving the @entity31 one vote shy of being able to overcome @entity5 filibusters of health care reform and other major initiatives			1
@entity2 first floated the idea of face - to - face , televised talks with @entity5 to seek a health care compromise last week			1
in a speech thursday at a fundraising event , he said whatever legislation emerges from the talks should then go to @entity121 for a vote			0
he announced the planned meeting in a nationally televised interview with @entity125 before the @entity126 on sunday , and said tuesday that the idea is to reach agreement on solving a problem that only will get worse			0
as an example , @entity2 cited a report his week that @entity132 , which he called the largest insurer in @entity134 , was planning to raise premiums for individual health policies by as much as 39 percent			2
" if we do n't act , this is just a preview of coming attractions : premiums will continue to rise for folks with insurance , millions more will lose their coverage altogether , our deficits will continue to grow larger , " @entity2 said , adding that " we have an obligation -- both parties -- to tackle this issue in a serious way			2
" that means both @entity31 and @entity5 will have to accept a bill that lacks all they want , but does the right thing for the country , @entity2 said			2
" i 'm willing to move off some of the preferences of my party in order to meet them halfway , but there 's got to be some give from their side as well , " the president said			0
first lady @entity162 , appearing tuesday on @entity1 's " @entity163 , " said she 's " hopeful that @entity121 will come together " to get health care legislation passed			2
" we 're spending billions of dollars on preventable diseases and new health care legislation could go a long way to improving prevention , first and foremost , " the first lady said			2
" people have to have a pediatrician in order to get good information from their pediatrician			0
people have to be able to take their kids to well doctor visits to have all this information tracked , " she said			0
" so , we have to get this done			0
" the @entity5 letter to @entity75 on the february 25 meeting offered the @entity5 view , saying : " bipartisanship is not writing proposals of your own behind closed doors , then unveiling them and demanding @entity5 support			2
bipartisan ends require bipartisan means			0
" @entity5 complain that the @entity31 majorities in the @entity10 and @entity56 rammed through their preferred bills without giving @entity5 issues a fair hearing			0
@entity2 and @entity31 respond that the bills went through the full legislative process , including lengthy committee meetings and floor debate , with republicans taking part and offering amendments , including some that were accepted			0
@entity2 said last week that @entity31 leaders were completing work on merging the @entity10 and @entity56 health care bills into a single @entity31 proposal for the talks with @entity5			1
a key question for the february 25 talks will be whether @entity2 and @entity31 leaders want their merged health care bill to serve as the starting point for an agreement			1
@entity5 complain the comprehensive @entity31 health care bills would lead to a government takeover of health care			1
they call for smaller steps focused on individual issues , such as limiting medical malpractice lawsuits			1
democrats , however , say that spiraling health care costs that threaten the nation 's future economic stability can only be addressed through comprehensive reform			2
@entity2 said last week that the merged @entity31 bill would expand coverage to 30 million @entity107 who currently lack health insurance while reducing long - term health care costs			1
it proposes an insurance exchange to allow people and small business owners to pool together to purchase coverage , @entity2 said , but he made no mention of a government - run public health insurance option that @entity5 have rallied against			2
@entity2 said the @entity31 proposal would include reforms that prevent insurance companies from denying coverage for pre-existing medical conditions or capping lifetime benefits			0
" and by the way , all of it is paid for , " @entity2 said			0
" not only is it deficit neutral , but the @entity243 , which is the bipartisan office that is the scorekeeper for how much things cost in @entity121 , says it is going to reduce the costs by $ 1 trillion			0
" @entity2 called health care reform the " single best way to bring down our deficits			1
" nobody has disputed that , " he added			0
" nobody can dispute the fact that if we do n't tackle surging health care costs , then we ca n't control our budget , " he said			2
@entity1 's @entity258 , @entity259 , @entity260 and @entity261 contributed to this report .			0
