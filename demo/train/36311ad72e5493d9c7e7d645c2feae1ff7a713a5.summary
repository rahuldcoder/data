@entity0 -- one moment there are rocket attacks and claims @entity4 fired at @entity6 fishermen			1
the next there 's the head of a @entity6 negotiating team detailing a five - day extension of a cease - fire in and around @entity0			1
then -- after yet more rockets hit @entity4 -- there are @entity4 airstrikes			1
so what gives ? is @entity4 's military action a blip or does it signal a full - scale resumption of the offensive that left nearly 2,000 in @entity0 dead , most of them civilians ? will @entity4 once again find themselves seeking shelter as rocket after rocket rain from overhead ? and do the peace talks , and the just announced cease - fire , have any chance ? none of these questions could be easily answered early thursday			1
one of the lone things that was patently clear is that -- as with most anything to deal with this region and these longtime foes -- the situation is both very complicated and very fragile			0
@entity6 officials offered hope of positive movement late wednesday , when lead negotiator @entity40 said the 72 - hour cease - fire put in place earlier this week should last another five days , from midnight ( 5 p.m. et wednesday )			1
the idea , senior @entity46 member @entity45 explained to @entity1 , was to give the parties " more time to reach an agreement on the issues			0
" " there remains a positive atmosphere towards reaching a comprehensive agreement , " @entity40 told reporters			1
" but there are still sticking points			2
" there 's also still violence			0
about the time @entity40 spoke , the @entity4 military claimed that at least eight rockets were fired toward its territory from @entity0			1
by thursday morning , @entity4 still had n't officially commented on whether it would go along with any cease - fire extension			1
but its military did respond to the new rocket attacks , by " targeting terror sites across " @entity0 , according to @entity66 spokesman @entity65			2
@entity1 crew in @entity0 heard multiple explosions overnight			2
" # @entity66 alert & prepared with defensive & striking capabilities to address renewed # @entity0 aggression & threat to # @entity4 , " @entity65 tweeted			1
@entity4 wants security ; @entity75 want more freedom the fact there was 70 hours of relative peace earlier this week and the @entity6 , at least , believed the truce would be extended into next week is a good sign			2
other cease - fires failed more quickly and more miserably			2
even the scale of attacks overnight wednesday was far less than what happened earlier this summer			0
the two sides have been talking in @entity87 through go - betweens			0
one core issue is difficult to quickly overcome			0
@entity4 , as well as the @entity90 and @entity91 , labels @entity46 -- the @entity93 militant group that controls @entity0 -- a terrorist organization ; @entity46 rejects @entity4 's right to exist			2
@entity4 says it wants @entity46 to disarm and @entity0 to be demilitarized			2
the @entity6 delegation in @entity97 , which includes @entity46 , demanded an end to @entity4 's economic blockade on @entity0 , an extension of fishing rights off the coast , the reopening of an airport and seaport , and the release of prisoners held by @entity4			1
@entity108 , head of the @entity6 team , said late wednesday that there 's still no agreement on the opening of crossings into @entity4 , " the launching of a free fishing zone " and various " security issues			2
" the stakes are high for the residents of @entity0 , where 1,962 people have been killed in the fighting , according to the @entity121			0
around 72 % of the dead are estimated to be civilians			0
stakes are also high for @entity4 , who have been living in fear of rockets fired from @entity0 and the militant attacks carried out through tunnels dug under the border			1
@entity4 's @entity131 missile defense system intercepted many of the roughly 3,500 rockets the @entity4 military says have been launched from @entity0			1
but prime minister @entity135 decided to send ground troops into @entity0 during the conflict to destroy @entity46 ' network of tunnels , resulting in intensified fighting			0
@entity4 officials say 64 of its soldiers have been killed , as well as three civilians in @entity4			2
the @entity66 pulled its soldiers out of @entity0 last week after they had demolished around 32 tunnels , but they remain positioned around the @entity6 territory			1
@entity4 and its neighbors : decades of war warning shots for @entity6 fishermen even if a cease - fire ends up sticking , it should n't be confused with widespread agreement			1
take , for example , claims on their websites by @entity46 and the @entity158 that @entity4 violated the 72 - hour cease - fire -- which had been set to expire at midnight -- by firing on @entity6 fishermen			1
@entity160 , head of the @entity0 fishermen 's union , told @entity1 that @entity4 's navy fired into the air wednesday morning at about 35 fishermen			1
there were no injuries reported , " but the fishermen had to go out to sea because they are poor and want to make some money and bring food to their families , " @entity160 said			0
the @entity4 military confirmed that it fired " warning shots " after " a @entity6 boat " went into part of the @entity176 that @entity4 considers " a closed military area			1
" then there was the renewed rocket attack from " @entity0 terrorists " that struck in the @entity183 area of southern @entity4 on wednesday night , according to an @entity4 military spokesman			2
there were no initial reports of injuries or damage			0
@entity46 -- in a text message from spokesman @entity190 -- denied that it had anything to do with any rockets fired toward @entity4			1
@entity4 did n't appear overly alarmed			0
" just one rocket is probably something we can move on from , " an @entity4 official , speaking on condition of anonymity shortly before @entity6 officials announced a cease - fire deal			1
but a slew of new rockets toward @entity4 , right around when the original cease - fire was to expire , may have changed the equation -- for both sides			1
aid flows into @entity0 during lull in violence whether or not it lasts , this week 's lull in violence did allow @entity0 residents to try to tackle some of the most urgent problems they face , including a lack of drinking water and leaking sewage pipes			0
aid groups said the situation remains dire , with more than 300,000 people estimated to have been displaced by the fighting in the small , densely populated enclave			0
the thousands of people wounded in the conflict have put a severe strain on medical resources			0
during the cease - fire , people have attempted to stock up on badly needed supplies , which have been allowed in through reopened border crossings			1
the @entity229 said it had brought in trucks of water , hundreds of mattresses , surgical equipment , food and household items like diapers			0
among the many families sheltering in @entity121 schools , some are unable to return to their homes because they were destroyed , and others have been going back just for the day and returning to shelters at night			0
some people feel it is too risky to leave shelters altogether , because so many of the previous cease - fires have failed			2
residents have also taken advantage of the calm to go out into the streets and visit beaches , parks and markets			0
but dangers left by the conflict remain			0
despite the cease - fire , at least five people died and six were injured wednesday when an @entity4 rocket exploded as @entity0 police bomb disposal technicians were working on it			1
among the dead were an @entity264 video journalist for @entity265 and a @entity6 freelance translator working with him			0
the @entity265 identified the journalist as @entity268 , who had worked for the news service since 2005			0
@entity270 , chief of the police station in @entity273 city , told @entity1 the explosion was the result of an accident during efforts to disarm the missile , which he said then exploded and set off another explosive nearby			0
opinion : why @entity4 is its own worst enemy opinion : hypocrisy of ' condemn @entity4 ' campaign is @entity286 peace as far away as ever ? @entity1 's @entity287 reported from @entity0 , @entity288 reported from @entity87 , and @entity289 reported and wrote from @entity290			2
@entity1 's @entity291 , @entity292 , @entity293 , @entity294 , @entity295 and @entity296 contributed to this report .			0

new : @entity66 : at least 8 rockets fired from @entity0 ; @entity4 responds with airstrikes
new : @entity6 negotiator : " positive atmosphere , " but " sticking points " remain
@entity6 officials announce a 5 - day extension of a cease - fire for @entity0
but the firing of rockets , @entity4 strikes raise questions about whether it will hold
