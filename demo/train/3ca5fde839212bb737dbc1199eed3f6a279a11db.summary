-- like @entity2 , @entity1 begin their day by watching one of several television news shows			1
these highlight the pressing issues facing the country			0
but @entity1 , of course , is not just any country , but a contested and often controversial jewish state situated in the epicenter of an overwhelmingly @entity12 and constantly roiling @entity11			1
one would expect , then , to hear commentators on these shows discussing the latest glitch in the peace talks with the @entity18 , the recent terrorist bombing just beyond @entity1 's southern border with @entity21 , or the revelation of more advanced rockets in the arsenal of @entity25 in @entity26			2
but the topic on @entity1 's leading morning show this week was none of these			1
the top issue , rather , was the percentage of @entity34 streets named for women			1
turns out that women 's studies scholars and feminist activists have examined @entity34 street names and discovered that the overwhelming majority of them are named for men			1
while preparing for work , i kept one eye on the television and listened , fascinated , as representatives of women 's rights groups argued passionately for gender equality in @entity34 street - naming			1
they made a compelling case and even the show 's hosts , who are generally testier than their @entity2 counterparts , were convinced			0
i , too , was impressed , and not only by the discussion , but also by the very fact that it was taking place			0
from @entity34 it is roughly a two - hour drive to @entity59 in @entity60 , the temporary home of tens of thousands of @entity62 refugees , making it the country 's second - largest city			1
from @entity34 , one can drive three hours north — less than the distance between @entity66 and @entity67 — and arrive in @entity68 , in the thick of the @entity62 civil war			1
or one can drive east from @entity34 and in eight hours reach @entity70 , where an estimated thousand people are being killed each month by suicide bombers			0
a similar excursion of about nine hours concludes in @entity74 in time for the latest confrontation between @entity21 protesters and police			0
a veritable firestorm is engulfing the @entity11 , and @entity1 's @entity34 is just a short commute from its flash points			1
yet it was women 's rights , not the upheaval encompassing @entity1 on all sides , which highlighted the morning news			2
one explanation , certainly , is that @entity1 need diversion from the chaos closing in on them , and what could be more distracting than a debate about signposts ? after all , the question of whether to name a street after @entity94 is certainly easier than asking if @entity1 can coexist with a nuclear - armed @entity95			2
another claim , one that is sometimes voiced by visiting statesmen , is that @entity1 have it too good to think about the hard choices they face in the peace process			0
in fact , support for the two - state solution is vastly higher among @entity1 today — more than 60 % -- than it was during the years of suicide bombing , when it was close to zero			1
but the real reason for @entity1 's interest in women 's rights at this time is much more fundamental and reveals this country 's secret			2
unique among the world 's nations , @entity1 has never known a second of peace			0
since its creation in 1948 , and for many years before that , the country has been in a relentless state of war			0
and yet , in spite of that trauma , @entity1 simply refuse to live abnormal lives			0
almost militantly , they insist on normality			0
call it a bubble , call it a fantasy , but the fact is that it works			0
in the midst of regional insanity , @entity1 have built several of the world 's leading universities , a cutting - edge high - tech sector , a universal health care system , and a wildly vibrant democracy			2
yes , there is controversy			0
there is still no two - state solution for @entity1 and @entity18 and no end in sight for the @entity95 nuclear program			1
@entity1 intelligence recently reported that terrorists are pointing 170,000 rockets and missiles at the jewish state			2
but on the streets of @entity34 , quite possibly the most threatened city on @entity152 , the cafes and cultural centers are packed , the food is superb and people are arguing why more of those streets are not named for women			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity159 .			0

@entity159 : @entity1 sits in a region *bristling* with *conflict* and hostile to its presence
he says one topic *stirring* attention is number of streets named for women in @entity34
@entity1 have always lived with the threat of war , and put it in *perspective* , he says
