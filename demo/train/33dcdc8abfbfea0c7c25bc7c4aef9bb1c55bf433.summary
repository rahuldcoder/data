-- if clamping down the privacy settings on your @entity3 page is n't enough to help you sleep at night , take a cue from the youth of @entity8			1
" performing the trick does n't take superhuman powers			0
instead of just closing a browser window or clicking the " log off " button at the top right of the @entity3 homepage , some young , privacy - concerned users are simply deactivating their @entity3 accounts each time they leave the site			1
then they reactivate their accounts to log back on			1
why go to all this trouble ? well , for one , it 's not hard			0
@entity3 makes it notoriously difficult to fully " delete " an account			1
but " deactivating " an account is easy -- it only takes a single click , and deactivated @entity3 users maintain all of their friend connections , wall posts , photos and the like			1
the upside , for the privacy paranoid , is that when a " deactivated " user is n't on @entity3 , no one else can see their profile , post on their wall or tag them in photos			1
for privacy - minded people , it 's a soothing alternative			2
it gives them ultimate control			0
@entity47 researcher and social media expert danah boyd ( she does n't capitalize her name ) , who identified the trend this week on her blog , believes young people may have good reasons for deactivating and reactivating their accounts frequently			1
" in many ways , deactivation is a way of not letting the digital body stick around when the person is not present , " boyd writes in a november 8 post			0
" this is a great risk reduction strategy if you 're worried about people who might look and misinterpret			2
or people who might post something that would get you into trouble			2
" she credits @entity70 , a program manager at @entity47 , with inventing the " super-logoff " term			0
as part of her field work , boyd has spoken with kids who use the technique to maintain control of their pages			0
one person she mentions on her blog , @entity87 , " wants to be a part of @entity3 when it makes sense and not risk the possibility that people will be snooping when she 's not around			1
" the blog @entity3 adds that this practice is fundamentally different , and in some ways simpler , than changing your privacy settings on the site : " notice that , while you or i might think that spending five minutes setting your privacy settings correctly might solve the hassle of having to deactivate your account when you log out , in reality these are two actions that accomplish different things , " @entity94 writes on that @entity3 - focused blog			1
" @entity87 and others like her want their friends to post stuff on their wall or tag them in a photo , but they do n't want them doing it when they 're not there to make sure it 's okay			0
most importantly , someone like @entity87 does n't want any friends of friends digging up her profile when she 's not ' around			0
' deactivating her page literally erases her from @entity3			1
" others do n't go quite as far , says boyd			0
instead of deactivating her account , @entity122 engages in practice known as " whitewalling , " boyd says			2
she deletes every " like , " comment and photo almost immediately after it 's posted			0
" when i asked her why she was deleting this content , she looked at me incredulously and told me ' too much drama , ' " boyd writes			0
she continues : " pushing further , she talked about how people were nosy and it was too easy to get into trouble for the things you wrote a while back that you could n't even remember posting let alone remember what it was all about			2
it was better to keep everything clean and in the moment			0
if it 's relevant now , it belongs on @entity3 , but the old stuff is no longer relevant so it does n't belong on @entity145			1
" her narrative has nothing to do with adults or with @entity3 as a data retention agent			1
she 's concerned about how her postings will get her into unexpected trouble with her peers in an environment where saying the wrong thing always results in a fight			0
" these stories add interesting nuance to the debate over young people and privacy on the @entity162			1
the general line of thinking -- which is backed up by some surveys -- is that young people care less about online privacy than older people			1
a @entity168 study released this week , for example , found that fewer members of @entity171 say they are " very concerned " about social network privacy than @entity173			0
but there appears to be more going on			0
a @entity176 internet report , released on may 26 , found young people are more likely than their older counterparts to alter their @entity3 settings and to actively manage their online identities			1
from that report : " @entity183 adults are the most active online reputation managers in several dimensions			2
when compared with older users , they more often customize what they share and whom they share it with			2
" this suggests younger people do care about their privacy and reputation online and will take steps -- sometimes big ones , as boyd 's blog post shows -- to manage these increasingly important digital identities			2
what do you think of these practices ? if you use the " super-logoff , " or plan to try it , let us know in the comments section below .			0

some @entity3 users deactivate their accounts instead of just logging off
they then reactivate the account -- with all info maintained -- to log on again
