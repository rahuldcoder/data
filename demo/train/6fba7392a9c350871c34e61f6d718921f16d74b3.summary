the @entity1 intelligence community now believes two key terrorist operatives targeted by the @entity1 in the opening night of attacks in @entity5 are still alive and could be actively plotting , multiple officials tell @entity7			1
the operatives are key members of @entity9 , the @entity10 affiliate entrenched in @entity5 that the @entity1 has declared poses a great risk to @entity1 national security			1
one official with direct knowledge of the latest @entity1 assessment said the working assumption now is that both @entity17 , the leader of the group , and @entity20 , a @entity21 jihadist and key member , who is believed to be a skilled bomb - maker , are alive			2
the @entity1 does not know with certainty if they are injured			2
an intelligence analyst with knowledge of the intelligence tells @entity7 " its 99.5 % certain " they are alive			1
there had been scattered press reports about the fate of both men			0
but until now the @entity1 had not indicated this strongly that it believes both men survived or left before a barrage of 47 @entity38 missiles on september 22 on several suspected @entity40 sites in @entity5			1
officials said news reports on @entity9 before the strikes may have had an impact on the effectiveness of striking the group			1
@entity47 is believed to be heavily involved in facilitating the movement of fighters back and forth from @entity50 , and in planning attacks in @entity50			0
his name has not been widely disclosed by the @entity1			2
like @entity17 and the rest of the @entity9 , @entity1 officials say @entity47 has ties to the core @entity10 group in @entity58 and is believed to have come to @entity5 from @entity58 in the last two years			1
@entity1 officials said he is believed to be one of the key bomb - makers in the group and may have been actively involved with creating easily concealed bombs that led to increased security measures at overseas airports this past summer			2
@entity1 intelligence officials said it 's possible he may still be living in @entity5			1
the @entity1 is tracking a number of @entity10 leaders believed to have moved into @entity5 , some having transited @entity70 to get there			1
@entity10 in @entity72 's master bomb - maker , @entity73 , is believed to have shared techniques and technology with @entity40			2
one of the targets during the @entity1 attack this fall was a bomb - making facility			0
another @entity1 official told @entity7 about a month ago there were communications intercepts suggesting the militants were discussing the possibility of @entity73 traveling to @entity85 , @entity5 , to offer direct assistance to @entity40 and the @entity87 , a related jihadist group			1
what 's the difference between @entity90 , @entity87 and the @entity9 ? @entity1 officials believe @entity73 did not take the risk of traveling to @entity5 and would not do so because of the presence of @entity1 reconnaissance and surveillance over @entity5 and the stepped up airstrikes			1
it is not clear to what extent those intercepts were verified as representing @entity73 's views			0
@entity1 officials have said recently they believe the missile attacks against @entity40 did not destroy the group and that it still poses an imminent threat to the @entity1 because of its ability to make bombs that are not readily detected by airport screening technology			1
the recently retired director of the @entity107 , @entity108 , said the threat from the group is still significant			0
" this group was in a position to train without any sort of interference , they were able to recruit operatives			0
we saw that they were looking to test explosives			0
so they were in the advanced stages of plotting			0
and again they had both intent and that capability that put them nearing an execution phase of an attack , " @entity121 told @entity7 " s @entity128			0
" i do n't think there 's any realistic likelihood that some limited airstrikes even just for a period of time will degrade that threat altogether			0
those individuals , they 're hardened , seasoned veterans , and they 've got an ability to operate pretty freely in @entity5			0
so i think it 's unlikely that threat 's altogether been eliminated			0
" the @entity1 has not acknowledged striking against the @entity9 since that first night in september .			2

@entity9 has been thought a target of @entity1 airstrikes
after first strikes in @entity5 , reports said top @entity40 members had been hit
@entity150 now says " its 99.5 % certain " they are alive
