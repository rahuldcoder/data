-- @entity1 on wednesday threatened to sue @entity2 over the practice of " patient dumping , " in which the state allegedly sent hundreds of indigent mentally ill patients on one - way trips to @entity10			1
in a letter to @entity2 's state attorney general , @entity1 city attorney @entity11 threatened a class - action lawsuit , saying @entity2 's state - run psychiatric hospital @entity16 sent two dozen patients to his city and hundreds more to other spots in @entity10 without any arrangements for care once they arrived			1
" as part of my office 's investigation , we have obtained the names of the almost 500 patients whom @entity16 discharged and sent by @entity30 to @entity10 since april 2008 , " @entity11 says in his letter to @entity2 attorney general @entity23			1
@entity11 said @entity1 has spent at least $ 500,000 on medical care , housing and subsistence grants for the patients since they arrived from @entity16			1
a spokeswoman for the @entity2 attorney general 's office , @entity38 , said the office received the letter and was working on the matter			1
" we can not comment further on pending litigation , " she said			0
the @entity44 newspaper first reported on the practice in march when it told the story of former @entity48 patient @entity47 , 48 , who was sent on a 15 - hour bus ride to @entity50 despite knowing no one in the area , never having visited , and having no arrangements for his care , housing , or medical treatment			2
@entity16 put @entity47 in a taxi to the greyhound bus station with a one - way ticket , snacks , and a three - day supply of medication to treat his schizophrenia , depression and anxiety , the paper reported			0
@entity47 said he was told to call 911 when he arrived			0
he was " completely confused " with no idea why he was sent to @entity50 , a social services worker told the @entity44			0
@entity47 disappeared in @entity50 , according to the newspaper , and his whereabouts remain unknown			0
in april , after reports that @entity16 bused more than 1,500 psychiatric patients to locations across the @entity77 , @entity11 's office launched an investigation to find out whether any of the 31 @entity30 bus tickets the hospital bought for trips to @entity1 were for improperly discharged patients , a statement from the city attorney said			2
the investigation discovered 24 patients were sent to @entity1 , including some who made multiple trips , and that 20 sought and received emergency medical care once they arrived , @entity11 's office said			1
that was just @entity1 , however			0
@entity11 's office said it later found that 500 @entity48 patients were sent to locations throughout @entity10			2
the alleged busing of patients " unlawfully burdened @entity10 local government resources ... in order to provide care and services which @entity2 was legally obligated to provide to its own indigent residents , " @entity11 's office said in a statement			1
" while our prospective litigation asserts the rights of @entity10 taxpayers , it 's equally necessary to protect society 's most vulnerable from continued institutional abuse , " @entity11 said			2
" homeless psychiatric patients are particularly defenseless from the kind of lawless ' patient dumping ' practices @entity2 officials engaged in			0
" @entity11 said @entity2 can avoid a lawsuit if it reimburses @entity10 local governments for the cost of taking care of the patients and adopts binding protocols to end the busing practice , his office said			1
@entity2 must respond to the offer by september 9			0
