@entity1 , @entity0 -- it 's 2020			2
you get home from work , kick off your shoes and relax -- on your very own tropical island			0
that night , your friends teleport over with other glamorous guests , all nipped , tucked and primped to perfection , for a hedonistic cocktail party at your five - star beach house , decked out in expensively understated chrome , crystal and fine @entity18 furniture			2
experts say the use of virtual worlds like @entity22 may be widespread by 2020 but this is no billionaire way of life			1
if virtual worlds become the next @entity27 phenomenon , experts predict that logging on to a luxury lifestyle could be attainable for all of us -- and we might even spend more money on our online homes than on our real - life surroundings			1
with over 30 million users worldwide , 8.5 million photos uploaded each day and 15 billion page views a month , @entity27 is undoubtedly the @entity37 's flavor of the month			1
but by 2020 , virtual worlds may have surpassed social networking sites as the place to spend time online			1
experts believe that the draw of 3 - d spaces where our avatars can hang out with our friends -- and meet new ones -- may tempt away even the most ardent @entity27 addict			1
@entity48 , a 35 - year - old @entity22 user from @entity49 , @entity50 , is one of many netizens exploring virtual worlds			1
he 's been visiting the site for over a year and told @entity2 that he enjoys its social dimension			0
" i 've met several good friends in @entity22 , who are still friends to this day in the ' real world ' " he said			0
at times , @entity48 has spent six hours a day , seven days a week on @entity22			0
but what is the draw of a virtual world ? are they only attractive to tech - heads ? @entity48 does n't think so			2
he says , " experience plays a role in acceptance to be sure , but @entity22 takes hold more on a social and creative level			0
someone who signs in and recognizes those aspects of @entity22 will immediately be hooked			0
" this is backed up by blogger and writer @entity70 , who has tracked virtual worlds from phone " party lines " through the first one - player text - based computer adventures to the two - and three - dimensional @entity37 worlds that are burgeoning today			1
@entity70 believes that , in a society that 's increasingly mobile , virtual worlds help us hold our far - flung social networks together			1
he cites the example of his mother - in - law , who recently moved to a new city and uses @entity27 to stay in touch with her three daughters			2
" they 're all busy , so virtual world technologies and web 2.0 apps are the best and most convenient ways to keep up , " he told @entity2			2
@entity70 says that virtual worlds take this interaction to a more sophisticated level			1
" i do n't even have to worry about cab fare if i want to have a little get - together with my friends from the @entity95 and the @entity96 tonight , " he said			0
and he thinks that it 's only a matter of time before virtual worlds follow @entity27 and explode in popularity			1
" bottom line : if people are using email for social interaction , they 'll probably be interested in other ways to be social online			0
" life - like avatars interaction on @entity27 , @entity108 and other social networking sites is mainly limited to text , with the ability for users to add photos and video			1
but in a virtual world , people are represented by avatars : computer - generated figures which can look uncannily like ourselves -- if we choose			2
they can walk like us , they 'll soon talk like us and they can interact with each other			0
as 3 - d technology becomes increasingly sophisticated , @entity70 says that photo - realistic avatars are just around the corner , and will become increasingly convincing			0
" @entity123 , breathing , and realistic expressions will be the easy part , " he revealed			0
" the hard part will come with things like synching mouth movements with voice recognition			0
that 's something we might not quite have nailed by 2020 , but there will definitely be some kind of engine that attempts it by then			0
" holographic projections of @entity139 objects are in development , but it will be some time before virtual reality offers us experiences akin to @entity144 's holodecks : touching and tasting virtual matter is still some way off			1
" we 're a long , long way away from having a completely immersive @entity150 - like world , " he told @entity2			0
" but then again , technology can surprise you			0
i remember joking with a friend about a guy who bought a brand - new vga monitor			0
it could display 256 colors at once -- who could honestly need something like that ? " @entity162 life offline , exotic life online the authors of the " @entity165 , " a briefing document that explores the possible development of virtual worlds over the next 20 years , agree that a boom within a decade is likely			1
their research has indicated that by 2016 , half of us will have interactive avatars , with those aged between 13 and 30 spending around 10 hours a week socializing in @entity139 visual environments			0
and the draw of virtual worlds may encourage some of us to forsake our mundane real - life surroundings for a luxury life online			1
the @entity165 points to the millions of youths who already use worlds like @entity182 and @entity183 , and suggests that " @entity184 raised in such conditions might live increasingly @entity162 lives in the physical world , and rich , exotic lives in virtual space			2
" it makes a certain kind of sense : why cripple yourself with huge mortgage payments on " real " real - estate when on @entity22 you can buy an entire island for $ 1,600 and $ 300/month maintenance ? the uses for virtual worlds do n't stop at socializing			1
virtual environments are already being built for education , like @entity202 's " @entity207 " project at @entity203 , which will transport users into a @entity206 world			2
the applications for interior designers are clear , while a team at the @entity96 @entity211 ( @entity211 ) in @entity212 , @entity213 have used the virtual shoot - em - up " @entity216 " to diagnose depression in players			2
business collaboration @entity70 believes that virtual worlds will be used increasingly as business tools			1
" they 're very well suited to collaborative work , " he explained			0
" we 're not sure why yet , but there 's something about seeing everybody 's avatar in the room with yours that makes the whole experience far more effective than if you were to simply have a conference call			0
it creates a real shared experience			0
" and with the launch of @entity238 's @entity237 -- an online world for the games console -- this autumn , it seems the big players in the entertainment world are banking on virtual realms being part of the future , too			2
" the common feeling is that by 2020 virtual worlds will be as widespread as the @entity248 is now , " states @entity70			1
with that popularity comes opportunity -- and not only for @entity37 land barons like self - proclaimed @entity22 millionaire @entity252 , but also virtual builders , landscapers and interior decorators , designers of avatar clothing and accessories , and even community moderators and governors			2
" a significant percentage of the world 's population will be able to make a living working in virtual worlds , " says @entity70			1
and he thinks that this potential is just around the corner			0
" the truth is that , as far as virtual worlds go , we 're living in the flash point at the beginning of the explosion			1
" ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... what future do you think virtual worlds hold ? would you give up @entity27 to hang out in a virtual space with your friends ? share your views and read others ' thoughts in the @entity279 forum			1

by 2020 , experts believe virtual worlds will be widespread
online worlds could *replace* @entity27 as most popular internet phenomenon
experts say young users could lead *spartan* lives offline , luxurious lives online
but @entity144 - style fully - interactive holodecks still some way off
