@entity0 , @entity1 -- returning from a trip to @entity6 , former @entity4 president @entity3 said that @entity8 leader @entity7 ready for a summit with @entity1 president @entity10 at any time			1
@entity3 did not personally meet with @entity7 , but he said that as he and his delegation of former heads of state were on the way to @entity6 airport to depart for @entity1 , they were summoned back to their guesthouse , where a senior official read out a written message from the reclusive leader			1
" chairman @entity7 sent word that he is willing to negotiate with @entity1 or @entity4 ... on any subject at any time and without any preconditions , " @entity3 told a news conference			1
" he specifically told us he is prepared for a summit directly with president @entity10 at any time to discuss issues between the two heads of state			1
" the dramatic declaration puts @entity10 on the spot : @entity0 is currently declining official dialogue with @entity8 until it takes responsibility for two fatal incidents last year			1
in 2010 , 50 @entity1 were killed in the two separate incidents : @entity1 accuses the @entity8 of torpedoing and sinking one of its warships in march 2010 , killing 46 sailors			1
in november , @entity8 shelled @entity42 , killing two @entity1 marines and two civilians			1
@entity8 denies the torpedo attack on the warship @entity47 , though a @entity0 - led international investigation has found a @entity8 mini-submarine responsible			2
following a range of nuclear and missile tests , and @entity6 's exposure last november of a uranium - based nuclear program -- a separate program from its earlier plutonium - based program -- the @entity60 administration is sanctioning @entity6 and has also put official contacts on hold			2
asked if he expected @entity6 to apologize to @entity0 , @entity3 said ; " my own assessment is that talks should begin without preconditions on either side			2
my opinion is @entity8 will not admit culpability for the sinking of the @entity47 and will not apologize			2
" @entity3 , 86 and his group had met @entity8 's de facto head of state @entity71 , as well as its vice defense minister and foreign minister and other officials			2
the visit had been intended to promote @entity78 dialogue , revive a denuclearization process , and assess food shortages			2
the delegation included former president of @entity83 , @entity84 , former prime minister of norway , @entity85 , and former president of @entity87 , @entity88			0
they are all members of " @entity90 " a group of retired leaders founded by former @entity94 leader @entity93 who undertake peace - building initiatives and non-state diplomacy			0
regarding @entity7 's offer of dialogues , @entity3 said : " @entity90 ' desire is that under some circumstances , these offers will be accepted by the leaders of @entity1 , the @entity4 and other leaders of the six - party talks			1
" the six - party talks are a @entity107 sponsored initiative to denuclearize the peninsula ; the parties are @entity110 , @entity111 , @entity8 , @entity112 , @entity1 and the @entity4			1
following @entity8 nuclear and missile tests , they have been in limbo for two years			0
as for why he had not been able to meet @entity7 personally , @entity3 responded : " we did request a chance to meet with him , and we did request an opportunity to meet with the president of @entity1			1
neither were available to meet with us			0
" with @entity8 suffering major food shortages , the @entity123 strongly suggested @entity1 and the @entity4 resume food aid to the ultra-nationalist state			1
" we would urge you here in @entity1 as we will urge the @entity129 and the @entity4 to realize there is a very severe crisis , " said @entity127			1
" the humanitarian issues must be disconnected from matters of political concern			0
it is a matter of life and death urgency			0
" there had been criticism of @entity3 in @entity1 for not raising human rights issues with the @entity8 , even though he did exactly that with @entity1 leaders of the authoritarian governments of the 1970s and 80s			1
asked by a @entity1 reporter if he had raised this issue with the @entity8 , @entity3 took a swipe at @entity1 and @entity4 policies			1
" there are human right issues that relate to the policies of the @entity8 government that i do n't think any of us on the outside can change , " he said			0
" but one of the most important human rights is to have food to eat and for @entity1 and @entity4 , and others to deliberately to withhold food aid for @entity8 people because of military or political issues unrelated is indeed a human rights violation			2
" @entity3 added that he believes that there are no longer any impediments to food aid monitoring			0
in the past , some governments and non-governmental organizations have criticized @entity6 for not permitting them to monitor their aid deliveries , raising suspicions that shipments could be going to the military , rather than to the most vulnerable populations			0
@entity85 , who is an @entity172 director , noted that one third of @entity8 children are stunted due to malnutrition , and one in five is underweight			0
@entity84 suggested that the resumption of dialogue is essential			0
" i think it is extremely important that we as @entity123 can recommend that there is , as early as possible , a resumption of dialogue on all outstanding issues , " he said			2
" i sincerely hope that parties can agree on a time frame in which to resolve these problems instead of a process that can last forever			0
" in @entity1 , where @entity8 defectors have alleged the existence of concentration camps , torture and the imprisonment of family members , @entity3 's message on human rights and his linkage to food aid is likely to raise hackles			1
" for the @entity1 audience , we need to hear that he raised the human rights issue with @entity8 as he did in @entity1 during the 1970s and 80s , that would bring more credibility , " said @entity201 , a director general at @entity0 's @entity202			1
" i do n't think his message will go far in [ @entity78 ] @entity1			2
" @entity3 and his delegation will be hosted at a banquet by @entity1 's foreign minister thursday evening			1
however , a representative of the @entity213 , the @entity1 presidency , said wednesday that it considered @entity3 's trip that of " private individuals			1
" @entity3 has a history of private diplomacy on the peninsula			0
in 1994 , after @entity6 had expelled international nuclear inspectors and threatening to turn @entity0 into a " sea of fire " and with the @entity4 mulling air strikes on @entity8 facilities , @entity3 flew into @entity6 to meet @entity226			0
that set the scene for the so - called " @entity229 " in which @entity8 would give up its nuclear facilities in return for light water reactors from the international community			0
that deal foundered after @entity235 accused @entity8 of having a secret uranium based nuclear program			0
@entity8 denied it at the time -- only to publicly reveal a uranium - based program last year			0
last year , another @entity3 visit to @entity6 resulted in the freeing of an @entity4 citizen held there			0
however , he had no opportunity to discuss strategic issues , because he was not met by @entity7			2
