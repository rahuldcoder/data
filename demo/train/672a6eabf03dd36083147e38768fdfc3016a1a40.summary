" i 'm confident that if we decide to run for president ... we will have the funding and the resources necessary to credibly run a campaign and win , " he said			0
" but i understand that the longer you wait , the harder it becomes to do that , " he added			0
@entity29 tells donors he 's considering 2016 bid @entity31 and @entity29 have already been in active in talking with big - money supporters and securing financial resources , making it strategically more difficult for other potential contenders like @entity0 to lock down support from the @entity7 's donor class			1

@entity78 @entity7 plans immigration showdown @entity0 , however , questioned whether it was the right move , saying he 's not in favor of " something that would be traumatic for the country or something that would put the nation in danger			1
