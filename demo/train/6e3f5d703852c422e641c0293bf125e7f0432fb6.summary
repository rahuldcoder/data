@entity0 , @entity1 -- i recently stumbled on a @entity4 , launched on october 10 this year			0
" we nigerians in @entity8 ( sic ) want to tell obama that we have got his back , " the inaugural tweet read			2
there 's nothing surprising about that -- after all , @entity15 , born of an @entity17 man , is " our son			1
" the story of " @entity20 " goes back four years , when it emerged that a black man actually stood a chance of becoming the president of the most powerful country in the world			2
here , the boss of the stock exchange launched an " africans for @entity15 " group ( never mind that she probably meant to say " @entity28 for @entity15 " ) and organised a fund - raising dinner that amassed $ 600,000 for the @entity31 candidate			1
postcard : why @entity35 , @entity8 are kindred spirits there was only one snag ; no one had taken the time to find out what @entity8 campaign financing laws had to say about such a move			1
the @entity15 campaign was n't allowed to receive the money , and @entity1 's anti-graft agency stepped in to probe the fundraising			1
for those who could n't say " yes we can " with their checkbooks , there was @entity51 which , back then , was a relatively new phenomenon in @entity1			0
we could join the @entity8 and the rest of the world to share our opinions about the son of @entity17 on his way to the @entity59			2
just a year after @entity1 's 2007 general elections -- which brought @entity61 to power in a election derided by some as a " charade " -- @entity15 's race to the @entity59 was a chance for @entity28 to vicariously participate in a political process that appeared transparent and was no doubt inspiring ; not to mention the amusement of indulging in debates about whether things would 've been different had @entity72 been @entity1 and not @entity73			1
map : the world weighs in on the @entity8 election four years later , a lot has changed			2
the novelty of 2008 has worn off , and many @entity28 appear to have moved on			1
much of the energy that in 2008 went into the @entity8 elections has since found an outlet in our own electoral processes			2
as i wrote this piece one of the prominent things on my @entity88 timeline was a running commentary on the live broadcast of the governorship debate in @entity1 's @entity92 , where elections are due this weekend			0
a scenario like this was highly unlikely four years ago			0
we also now have our own " @entity51 president " -- @entity98 announced his decision to run for president on @entity51 , and is today one of the world 's most " liked " heads of state on the social networking site ( he has actually been called " @entity1 's @entity15			1
" ) it is this homegrown excitement that the @entity15 - @entity107 contest now has to compete against			1
i 've been randomly asking friends if they stayed up to watch the first presidential debate			0
while most respondents did n't , as the debate took place at 3:00 a.m. here , a @entity8 debate is just the sort of thing -- like the @entity117 or @entity119 matches -- that would have set @entity88 afire in @entity0			0
postcard : @entity15 's ' hope ' a mirage for hostile @entity123 i awoke the next morning to find a @entity125 message from a friend to a group of 16 of us			1
he 'd sent it during the debate , asking if anyone was up			0
when i saw it the next morning , i panicked slightly , wondering what emergency had arisen overnight			0
it turned out there 'd been no emergency ; he simply wanted to know if anyone else was watching			0
only one other member of the group was awake at that time			0
lawyer and big brother @entity1 alumnus @entity142 , another of my friends who watched that first debate , told me he did so as a " cynic " , merely for an opportunity to see @entity15 " challenged " after a lackluster first term			0
@entity150 , @entity1 's best - known entertainment blogger , has been weighing in on the @entity8 presidential debates			2
in response to her post asking readers if they watched the first debate , and if it " harm [ ed ] " @entity15 , a comment described the @entity8 president as " simply clueless " -- an interesting choice when one considers that " clueless " is one of the most widely used epithets used to describe president @entity98			1
postcard : war - scarred @entity163 has little faith in election perhaps we 're seeing in @entity15 a reflection of our own president : swift dissipation of a hope founded largely on a campaign charged with personal stories ; a case of soaring soapbox poetry swiftly replaced by the clunky prose of presidential politics			1
yet none of the @entity1 love @entity15 may have lost appears to have found its way to mr. @entity107			1
@entity181 's post about the second debate clearly demonstrates that the fondness for mr. @entity15 in these parts is instinctive			2
in the last couple of days i 've seen friends on social media tickled by the idea of a " @entity107			0
" @entity191 's faith is n't a big help to him here either , in a country where fervent pentecostals remain wary of @entity195 ( of whom there are roughly 100,000 in @entity1 today )			0
postcard : @entity15 , @entity107 ignore @entity199 at own peril still , we 're nowhere near the 2008 levels of @entity8 election enthusiasm			1
if the @entity17 for @entity15 dinner was the high point of 2008 , the high point of the 2012 @entity8 presidential season in @entity1 was the controversy around the presence of opposition party leader @entity210 at the @entity212			1
initial reports quoted his team as saying he was specially invited by @entity15 --- but it quickly emerged that @entity210 did not receive any special invitation , and his party reportedly said he 'd paid a fee to attend			0
for days national media feasted on the story and the ruling @entity222 seized its chance to pillory the opposition @entity224 , describing it as " founded on fraud and deceit			0
" postcard : @entity228 fear what could follow @entity8 election that sort of name - calling , as opposed to debates around manifesto highlights , lies at the heart of @entity1 politics			0
2015 might actually end up being the first @entity1 general election in recent history in which " issues " -- power , state subsidies , taxation , roads , etc. -- will carry the day			0
since we 're not conditioned to judging candidates on the strength or otherwise of their beliefs in health insurance or taxation or foreign policy , it 's easy to tune off when the @entity8 elections slide into that territory			2
" a lot of @entity28 do n't understand the politics or economy of @entity8 , " says journalist @entity254 , saturday editor at the @entity0 - based @entity255			1
" it 's the soap opera that @entity28 are interested in , not the issues			1

in 2008 , @entity28 were inspired by @entity15 's run for the @entity8 presidency
@entity265 : " @entity20 " has largely worn off , but he remains more *popular* than @entity107
@entity265 : @entity28 are more interested in the campaign drama than the political issues
