@entity0 is 69 years old , and lives clear across the country from her older brother , @entity2			2
but she can still rely on him to look out for her -- just as he did when she was growing up			0
" the way our parents raised us , we stood up for ourselves , and my brother always protected me , " @entity5 said			0
even though @entity2 stuck up for his little sister as they came of age in @entity13 , @entity14 , he could n't always protect himself , or her , from the cruel words of playmates who viewed their dark skin as offensive			2
" we were made fun of , called ' @entity21 ' -- that was our introduction to kindergarten , " she said			0
" you were made to feel ' less than ' because your skin was darker , and ( that ) being dark brown or black was ugly			1
" @entity5 's experiences as a " dark girl " were an inspiration for @entity31 's documentary that explores the sometimes painful , undercover story of colorism -- discrimination based on skin tone -- inside and outside the black community			1
now a respected actor and filmmaker , @entity37 used his industry clout to bring attention to the issue			1
@entity37 , along with @entity43 , co-directed and co-produced " @entity46 , " which will be released on dvd september 24			1
when it premiered on the @entity49 channel earlier this year , the film stirred spirited conversation about black beauty , just as it did at screenings around @entity53			1
" dark girls is a phenomenal documentary that opens the door on that light skinned / dark skinned thang , " @entity54 tweeted in june			1
after the trailer hit the web in 2011 , the filmmakers soon learned that the issue did not only resonate among darker - hued @entity64 women			1
" i started getting e-mails from women in @entity67 , and i was thinking to myself , i do n't know any black women in @entity69 , or @entity67 or other places around there , " @entity43 said			1
" and i kept getting ( correspondence ) from women 's groups in the @entity74 asking us to talk about this , and screen the movie			2
" in this edited conversation , co-directors @entity31 and @entity43 shared with @entity81 what they learned making the film and how the conversation began			1
@entity81 : how did two male directors become interested in making a film about " @entity46 " ? @entity37 : i saw the things that my sister went through -- she 's dark skinned -- with boys not considering her attractive in her youth and the pain that it caused her			1
you have to explain to people the damage that it does to a young woman , and to see it and experience it is something that you do n't forget : her crying in her room alone , her trying to lighten her skin , her feeling ugly , me having to beat up young boys because they said she was ugly , that type of thing			0
@entity81 : how do you define " dark girls " ? the documentary begins by looking at the issues of intracultural colorism within the black @entity64 community , but also touches on issues of color in @entity112 and around the world			1
@entity43 : it changed , it really changed through my research			1
it was about sisters who were dark in complexion			2
but the more i started to do interviews around the country and around the world -- and this is the crazy thing i found out , it was so enlightening -- that all women around the world are " dark girls " at some point in time in their lives			1
it has nothing to do so much with the complexion of one 's skin			0
it has everything to do with the lack of women 's self - esteem			2
that 's what i learned			2
and i also learned that pain is pain : if you 're dark , you 've got some pain , if you 're light in complexion , you 've got some pain			1
@entity81 : was there a particularly emotional or difficult time for you , personally , in your process of filmmaking ? how did it impact you ? @entity37 : i think the footage that came in with the children			1
the little girl , when she 's asked ' what 's beautiful ? ' points to everything that is opposite of ( what ) she is			0
that one got to me because she 's already saying that she is ugly and she 's 6 or 7 years old			0
at that age , you 're seeing ( this ) instilled in their consciousness , and what it does to their spirit and what it does to their self - esteem			0
it 's a very difficult thing to digest			0
and that 's what motivates me to do something			0
because our children are at stake			0
@entity81 : you did the film in 2011 and screened it in major @entity64 cities before it was picked up by @entity49 and aired earlier this year			2
what was the reaction from audiences ? was there any resistance to a topic that is rarely discussed across racial lines ? @entity37 : are you kidding me ? ! of course			1
i was at a theater , and an elderly lady -- beautiful woman -- stands up and says : ' mr. @entity31 , i really appreciate your film , but why are you airing our dirty laundry ? ' and i said to her : ' because it 's stinking up the house			1
' the things that kill us as a ( black ) community is our silence			2
@entity81 : how has the conversation around this issue changed from when you began the project in 2011 to now in 2013 ? @entity43 : the conversation is now open , and that 's all we can do			2
i 'm not a psychiatrist or psychologist or a sociologist			0
i 'm a filmmaker who decided to point a lens ( on this topic )			0
i do n't have all the answers			0
i 'm just supposed to present what i think is an issue and have dialogue start			0
and that was good enough			0
that was good enough that people recognize that there is an issue			0
the best thing to do is start conversation about it , so the healing can begin .			0
