the @entity1 government is expanding the number of commercial companies that can legally use unmanned aerial systems , often called uavs or drones , but efforts to safely integrate them into the national airspace are not moving fast enough for some lawmakers			1
wednesday the @entity10 granted five new exemptions to four companies to operate the remote controlled aircraft for commercial purposes			1
the companies that received permission to fly the drones @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 , and @entity22 , will use them to for aerial surveying , construction site monitoring and oil rig flare stack inspections			1
the drones will be under 55 pounds and must stay within sight of the operator			2
for decades hobbyists have been allowed to operate the remote controlled aircraft for recreational purposes close to the ground and away from airports , but any legal commercial use requires special exemptions from the @entity10			1
" unmanned aircraft offer a tremendous opportunity to spur innovation and economic activity by enabling many businesses to develop better products and services for their customers and the @entity1 public , " transportation secretary @entity36 said in a press release on wednesday			2
" we want to foster commercial uses of this exciting technology while taking a responsible approach to the safety of @entity1 's airspace			0
" earlier this year the @entity10 issued waivers to allow seven motion picture companies to use drones			1
the agency says a total of 167 requests for waivers have been received in 2014			0
in a congressional hearing wednesday lawmakers criticized the pace of the @entity10 's efforts to integrate the drones into the national airspace			1
" road builders in @entity68 and farmers in @entity70 today are enjoying economic benefits from @entity18 because safety regulators there have found ways to permit such flights , " congressman @entity66 said			0
" i ca n't help but wonder , that if the @entity68 , the @entity70 and the @entity78 do some of these things today , then why ca n't we also be doing that ? " earlier this week in a letter to the @entity10 , obtained the @entity83 , @entity81 warned it could take its drone delivery development outside of the @entity1			1
" without approval of our testing in the @entity1 , we will be forced to continue expanding our @entity90 footprint abroad , " @entity85 , vice president of @entity86 wrote			0
in wednesday 's hearing the @entity10 acknowledged that it was not moving fast enough			1
" we all agree that that project is taking too long , " @entity92 , @entity10 associate administrator for @entity93 told the committee			2
" we are moving forward with @entity18 integration through rule - making , as mandated by ( @entity98 )			1
" the most significant risk for drone use and the challenge for regulators working to safely integrate them into the national airspace is the potential that one could hit a passenger plane			0
a drone could strike a wing and cause a fuel explosion or sucked into an engine potentially causing a catastrophic failure			0
" we have all seen photos of the damage that can be cause to an airplane when a bird strikes in flight , " captain @entity111 of the @entity112 told the committee			0
" unmanned aircraft can be much smaller or much larger than birds but they harbored added risk in that they carry batteries , motors and other hard metal components			0
" last month in @entity128 a drone came within 20 feet of striking a plane , forcing the aircraft to take evasive action , according to @entity10 reports obtained by sen. @entity133			1
more than 190 incidents were reported over the last nine months , including two dozen near collisions			0

" i think this is a more dangerous scenario that you guys need to be putting a priority on			0
there are too many of these out here that are capable of going beyond couple hundred feet but actually going up to 6,000 feet , we 've got a problem and our failure to regulate them -- we 're going to have a genie out of the bottle issue			0
