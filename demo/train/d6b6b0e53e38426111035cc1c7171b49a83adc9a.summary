@entity0 -- narrow passage of a sweeping health care bill by the @entity4 portends a continuing difficult fight for president @entity6 and fellow @entity7 to get a bill through the @entity9 and into law			1
the @entity4 voted 220 - 215 late saturday , with 39 democrats opposed and one @entity12 in favor , to approve what would be the biggest expansion of health care coverage since @entity17 was created more than 40 years ago			1
the @entity18 , or @entity18 , restricts insurance companies from denying coverage to anyone with a pre-existing condition or charging higher premiums based on gender or medical history			1
it also provides federal subsidies to those who can not afford it			0
and it guarantees coverage for 96 percent of @entity32 , according to the nonpartisan @entity33			0
but turning the bill into law remains uncertain			2
the @entity9 must now pass its own version of a health care bill , and senate majority leader @entity38 of @entity39 last week signaled uncertainty over whether that will happen this year			1
once both chambers have passed a bill , a congressional conference committee will merge the two proposals into a consensus version that would require final approval from each chamber and @entity6 's signature			1
on sunday , @entity6 praised the " historic " @entity4 vote to pass the bill and called on the @entity9 to " take the baton " and complete its work			1
" for years , we 've been told that this could n't be done , " @entity6 said , citing the decades of failed health care reform efforts			0
" last night , the @entity4 proved differently			1
" the president called the support by many @entity4 members " courageous " in the face of " the heated and often misleading rhetoric around this legislation			1
" " now it falls on the @entity9 to take the baton and bring this effort to the finish line on behalf of the @entity32 people , " @entity6 said			2
" and i 'm absolutely confident that they will			0
" however , @entity12 and an independent senator who sits with the @entity70 caucus signaled sunday that difficulties remain for @entity6 on his top domestic priority			2
sen. @entity73 , an independent from @entity74 , reiterated that he would join a @entity12 filibuster against a health care bill if it contains a government - run public health insurance option after the chamber 's amendment process			1
speaking on " @entity81 , " @entity73 called the controversial public option , which is in the @entity4 bill and the @entity9 version being prepared by @entity38 , an unnecessary provision intended to bring government - run health insurance in the future			1
" if the public option is in there , as a matter of conscience , i will not allow the bill to come to a final vote , " @entity73 said			2
he previously has said he wo n't oppose opening @entity9 debate on the bill despite the public option provision , and he maintained that stance sunday			1
@entity73 's stance is crucial because the @entity70 caucus has the minimum 60 votes to overcome a @entity12 filibuster			2
@entity9 @entity12 unanimously oppose the public option , though sen. @entity102 of @entity103 has floated the possible compromise idea of a trigger mechanism that would mandate a public option in the future if thresholds for expanded coverage and lower costs go unmet			1
the lone @entity4 @entity12 who supported the bill , rep. @entity113 , told @entity1 on sunday he put the needs of his district over the desire of his party			1
@entity113 's " yes " vote ended up being unnecessary for @entity7 , but it gave house speaker @entity121 license to tout bipartisan support for the controversial measure			1
" i felt last night 's decision was the proper decision for my district , even though it was not the popular decision for my party , " said @entity113 , a first - term representative from @entity125 's traditionally @entity70 2nd district			0
" a lot of my constituents are uninsured , a lot of them are poor			0
it was the right decision for the people of my district			0
" @entity113 acknowledged he extracted some @entity136 pledges to help his district deal with the continuing effects of @entity139 in exchange for his vote			0
asked about the reaction of fellow @entity12 , @entity113 said the party 's leaders " respect my decision , and i respect theirs			2
" also sunday , rep. @entity147 of @entity148 , the chamber 's third - ranking @entity12 , said on the @entity81 program that @entity7 were ignoring the wishes of the @entity32 public by pushing through the huge health care bill			1
@entity147 said the health care bill would raise costs , increase the deficit and lead to a government takeover of the health care system			0
" i think the @entity32 people are deeply frustrated with the liberal establishment in @entity0 , " @entity147 said			0
" if @entity7 keep ignoring the @entity32 people , their party 's going to be history			2
" @entity70 rep. @entity163 of @entity164 responded on the same show that the @entity33 reported that the @entity4 bill would reduce the deficit			1
@entity163 chided @entity12 for failing to confront rising health care costs harming the @entity32 economy during the years they controlled the @entity136 and @entity171			2
" we 've had a great system for insurance companies , " @entity163 said , citing large industry profits as @entity32 face what he called unfair practices such as having coverage denied for pre-existing conditions			0
" this is a message to the @entity32 people ; we 're trying to bring down your costs to help more americans afford health insurance			0
" the @entity4 vote less than an hour before midnight saturday was full of drama			1
with eight seconds left in the voting period , @entity7 began counting down and erupted in roars when @entity121 declared , " the bill is passed " and banged the gavel			1
@entity12 lawmakers stood silently across the floor , some with their arms folded across their chests			2
" well , it was about what i thought it would be , " said @entity196 @entity195 of @entity197 as he quickly exited			0
later , he issued a statement saying the $ 1.2 trillion legislation would add to the country 's " skyrocketing " debt			0
" i came here to renew the @entity206 , so my kids and their kids have the same opportunities i had , " @entity195 said			0
" i came here to fight big - government monstrosities like this bill that dim the light of freedom and diminish opportunity for future generations			2
" @entity217 , the chairman of the @entity218 , released an equally tersely worded statement			0
" @entity121 and her liberal lieutenants made a lot of promises today to get the votes they desperately needed , " he said			0
" make no mistake -- the @entity228 leadership 's assurances were based on political expediency , not principle			0
anyone receiving a promise from @entity121 is guaranteed to be disappointed in the end when their votes are no longer needed			0
" earlier in the day , @entity6 met behind closed doors with @entity7 to shore up support for the bill , calling it a chance of a generation			1
in the run - up to the vote , @entity12 and conservative @entity7 joined forces to pass an amendment to the bill to prohibit federal funds for abortion services			1
it was considered a big win for them and for the @entity250 , which used its power -- especially with conservative democrats in swing congressional districts -- to help force @entity70 leaders to permit a vote on the amendment			0
the prohibition , introduced by @entity70 members -- including rep. @entity260 of @entity148 and rep. @entity261 of @entity262 -- would exclude cases of rape , incest or if the mother 's life is in danger			0
the @entity12 accounted for 174 of the votes in favor of the amendment , with one @entity12 voting " present			2
" on the @entity7 ' side , 64 voted for the measure , and 194 voted against			1
@entity1 's @entity275 , @entity276 , @entity277 , @entity278 and @entity279 contributed to this report .			0

@entity4 voted 220 - 215 late saturday to approve @entity18
39 @entity7 opposed act , one @entity12 voted for it
measure now moves to @entity9 , where support is less certain
if both chambers pass a bill , committee will merge the two proposals
