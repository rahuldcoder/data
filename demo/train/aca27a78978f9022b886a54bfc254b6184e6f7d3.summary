-- the @entity2 government tried and failed to swap three captured @entity4 military personnel for two @entity2 @entity6 jets whose pilots defected with their warplanes to the @entity10 island nation of @entity11 last month			1
@entity13 officials who helped negotiate the release of the @entity4 prisoners in conjunction with @entity18 diplomats on thursday , say they rejected @entity2 's request for the return of the @entity2 @entity22 fighter planes			1
in a telephone interview with @entity0 , a spokesman for @entity11 's foreign ministry said @entity2 sent @entity26 , a senior @entity2 diplomat , on a private jet to @entity11 on wednesday to meet with @entity28 , the @entity13 prime minister			2
" during the discussion it was discussed whether @entity11 would give back the two mirages in exchange for the @entity4 prisoners , " said ministry spokesman @entity29			2
in an interview with the @entity11 newspaper this week , @entity28 said he refused this suggestion and insisted that the @entity4 prisoners had to be released immediately without any conditions			1
the three @entity4 navy personnel were captured by @entity2 security forces on february 27 , after they tried to evacuate a @entity4 citizen from @entity2 by helicopter			1
the prisoners , two men and a woman , were later shown on @entity2 state television along with their @entity43			0
@entity2 state tv also showed captured weapons , and claimed that the crew had been operating a fighter helicopter in @entity2 territory in violation of international law			2
after several rounds of negotiations this week , " eventually the @entity2 authorities accepted to release the @entity4 prisoners without getting the two mirages back , " said @entity29			1
the @entity2 government has reportedly made several requests to @entity13 officials to have its fighter planes returned , since their pilots landed unexpectedly in @entity11 on february 21			1
the pilots said they refused to carry out order by the government of @entity66 to bomb @entity2 protesters			2
@entity13 officials say the two pilots have since requested political asylum			1
on thursday , the @entity4 foreign ministry announced @entity2 authorities had released the three @entity4 prisoners and that they were in good condition after being flown from @entity74 to @entity75 , @entity18			1
@entity11 , a small island nation less than 250 miles off the @entity2 coast , has long had close economic and political ties with the @entity66 regime			0
some observers call @entity11 the " gateway to @entity2			0
" but the increasingly bloody conflict in @entity2 has put this small country in an increasingly precarious position			0
since forces loyal to @entity66 began a deadly crackdown on unarmed protesters last month , @entity11 worked with the @entity87 , @entity88 and other governments to help evacuate foreigners fleeing @entity2			0
however , the @entity13 government also announced it is unwilling to play a larger diplomatic or military role in the growing confrontation between the @entity95 and @entity2			0
" the @entity13 prime minister reiterated that @entity11 will not be used as a military base should there be an action against @entity2 , " said @entity29 , the @entity13 foreign ministry spokesman , citing a neutrality cause in @entity11 's constitution			0
" @entity11 will not act as a mediator between @entity2 and the @entity95 , even though @entity2 formally asked @entity11 to , " @entity29 added			0
@entity0 's @entity105 contributed to this report .			0
