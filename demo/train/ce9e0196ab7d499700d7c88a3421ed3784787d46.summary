-- how long did it take you to get a taxi last time you tried ? if it was longer than 20 minutes , then chances are you live in the sticks or were calling on a busy friday or saturday night			1
catching a cab can be easy , whether you 're in a big city or a crowded sporting event			1
but seemingly everyone has had difficulty calling or hailing a cab at some stage , on vacation or a business trip or when stranded in a city center after a night out			1
so what 's the best , and quickest , way to get hold of a cab in @entity21 ? or @entity22 , @entity23 ? or at a major sporting event ? we find out			1
beware the bandit @entity27 , a taxi driver in @entity22 , says in general a passenger 's situation dictates the quickest way to get a cab			1
in downtown @entity22 or in a commercial or tourist area , hailing a cab works best , he says , but calling one is the quickest way in suburban areas			1
cabbies , he says , prefer fares that are called from a home or business as it gives the taxi company some information about the customer - their phone number , name and residence - in case the fare turns into trouble			0
does this mean that taxis are more likely to respond to a call than being hailed ? " if they 're there and need a ride i stop my cab , " @entity54 says			1
" the biggest problem we face is bandit cabs			0
never take a bandit cab , " he says			1
@entity27 says he 's seen unlicensed operators in @entity22 since he got his license 15 years ago , and that while they might in some cases be quicker or more available ; the risks of hailing one are too great to justify			1
he says that licensed cabs will be clearly marked with a city insignia , and tells the tale of when he went to the theater in downtown @entity22 and saw the long lines for a cab and decided , against his better judgment , to hail one of the many unlicensed cabs outside			2
on the 10 - or - so mile drive to his home , he noticed the meter was running too fast			2
" i said , ' i am a cab driver			2
i know that your meter is running too fast			0
' he [ the driver ] said : ' that 's the way it is			2
" and i paid the fare			0
[ but because ] it was an illegitimate taxi , i could not phone anyone to complain			0
" @entity0 : cheapest family sedans bad apples in the big apple @entity96 , the chairman of the @entity97 , concurs , telling @entity0 : " i think the number one , most important thing for anyone seeking taxicab or taxicab - like spontaneous service in @entity21 to understand is that only yellow , medallion taxicabs are legally empowered to solicit or accept street hails from the public			0
the driver of any other kind of vehicle that is soliciting passengers or responding to your taxi hail is already doing something illegal			0
" @entity0 autos : cheapest luxury cars he says that in adverse weather conditions or during peak demand hours , customers can be tempted to hop into something that looks like a legitimate limo or black car , but he , too , warns of the risks			0
" @entity124 - licensed drivers are drug - tested and have had a criminal background check , and @entity124 licensed vehicles are inspected three times annually and carry insurance levels well in excess of the state 's minimum requirements			2
" @entity0 autos : best car deals this month " taxicabs go where the people are			0
if you are hailing from the street , hail in the direction you are traveling to save turn - around time for both you and your driver			0
if you have the time to plan ahead , a call or web site visit to a local livery service , black car or limousine service can quickly and conveniently arrange guaranteed door - to - door pick - up and drop - off			0
look for the @entity124 diamond sticker inside the right - hand side of the windshield			0
" @entity0 autos : best looking 2009 cars use your @entity153 @entity154 is the latest innovative application to come to your @entity153 and allows a user to book a taxi at 25 of the nation 's biggest cities - excluding @entity21 - and track the progress of the driver en route , all by pressing the @entity153 's touch screen a couple times			1
helpfully , while saving you time talking to an operator it also cuts down on the number of calls the operator has to field , speeding up the service for others			0
the app , which pinpoints your location with gps and calculates the nearest cab firms , was released by web site @entity177 , which also features online booking and other goodies like taxi expense and receipt tracking and , in partnership with some companies , payment and account options that are always useful on vacation or business trips			1
@entity0 autos : best 2009 cars for your money get seen easier late at night sometimes you get the feeling that all the cabs that drive past because cabs have n't seen you , something @entity193 , @entity195			1
company @entity196 wants to remedy with its line of pocket - sized bright yellow led light , which it says can be seen up to three city blocks away			0
the company says it increases your visibility in crowds and its light can be seen in rain , sleet or snow			0
in a release last week , @entity196 president , @entity206 , said : " @entity196 has been very well received by cab drivers in @entity21			2
drivers have told me that @entity196 will be a great help to them , especially in identifying fares at night and in bad weather			2
" in the dark and when it 's dry , you can also try holding up an iphone with @entity216 's ingenious flashlight application , which can create a strobe - light effect to catch a driver 's attention , and a couple other @entity221 applications also will let you spell out taxi in flashing billboard - effect lettering			1
sporting events @entity225 , manager at the @entity226 , which represents 350 @entity228 cabbies , says location is key to quickly getting a cab			1
he lends no credence to the rumor that patrons carrying luggage tend to get picked up quicker as cabbies know a tip is more likely at @entity237 ( and usually drivers will go out of their way to earn it by taking the frequently heavy bags from the trunk to the curb )			2
@entity228 , he says , has hundreds of taxi stands around the city , mostly on main thoroughfares , and he says his organization and others are working to put electronic cab - tracking , wait time and fare calculators in place for a new generation of taxi customers			2
but how about catching a cab at @entity228 's famous sporting events , a @entity257 or @entity259 game ? he chuckled ruefully			1
" you 're talking about the worst time ; you 're competing against 20,000 other patrons for cabs at the same time			0
the cabs are out there on @entity266 trying to serve the public , but it 's tough			0
if you leave before the end of the game you might have a shot at getting a cab quicker			1

taxis drive past you at night because they ca n't see you
