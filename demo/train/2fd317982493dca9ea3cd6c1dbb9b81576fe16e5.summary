@entity0 -- two families , two political parties -- one family business			0
it 's hard to understate the depth of the @entity9 - @entity8 impact on @entity11 politics			1
think of it this way : for 32 years , there was either a @entity9 or a @entity8 in the @entity15 or the @entity16			1
and in 2016 , the families could be competing again -- in a @entity9 vs. @entity18 face off			1
whether that should come to pass has been a topic of lots of debate and speculation -- even inside the @entity9 family			1
after @entity28 made her now infamous pronouncement last year on the " today " show that @entity9 should sit it out ( " we have enough @entity33 , " she said ) , there 's been lots of private family discussion			1
but in an exclusive interview with @entity1 , @entity9 's brother , @entity36 , made it clear that his dad -- @entity40 -- wants his son to run , no matter what his wife says			1
" if you asked @entity45 the same question ' should @entity9 run ? ' he 'd say yes			1
" asked again whether @entity40 would specifically be for it , @entity48 replied , " yeah , he would say yeah			0
" has @entity36 asked his father himself ? no. but he allowed , " i have heard him answer that question			0
" and right now , that 's as close as you 'll get to the family thinking			2
a common concern @entity28 's concern -- that there are " other families " out there who can serve -- may be anathema to the family , but it 's a common concern in the rest of the political world			2
is n't it an advantage , for example , for a name brand to raise gobs of money from a standing start ? not to mention starting out with a ready made political organization			2
@entity72 , a speechwriter in the @entity73 @entity15 , likens it to something , well , un-american			1
" the thing that they bring to the table that nobody else has is the massive preexisting ability to raise money , " he said			0
" if we end up having a presidential race in which one dynasty plays off against another dynasty , you 'll say is this @entity11 or is it the last days of the @entity88			1
" he has a point			0
a @entity91 2016 matchup would n't be the first time a @entity9 faced a @entity8			1
@entity8 defeated @entity40 in 1992 ; now the men are the closest members of the ex-presidents club			1
" i think there is a great , you know , kind of bond ... , " @entity48 said of @entity8 and his family			1
" i think @entity40 ( @entity73 ) calls him ' @entity8			1
' " the next chapter what happens next with the @entity103 and the @entity33 is the story of great expectations			0
in many ways , said political commentator and author @entity107 , @entity9 and @entity18 have had similar trajectories			1
" @entity9 ... was the chosen one			1
he was the one who would be president someday and succeed his father , but ' @entity111 ' was the oldest and had better political skills and came first , " @entity107 said			0
" and similarly with @entity18 , there was a feeling before she even married @entity8			1
people in the early ' 70s were starting to think someday there would be a woman president			0
" of course , not all @entity33 and @entity103 are created alike			0
some have political skills and some do n't			2
and former @entity40 and 43 adviser @entity122 said both @entity9 and @entity18 offer some things others do n't -- experience and ideas			1
" this campaign particularly at this time in our country 's history is gon na turn on message , candidate skills , candidate policies -- not their names , " @entity122 said			1
" they can run as @entity18 and @entity135 and people will be listening to what they are proposing			1
" there are real downsides to carrying the @entity9 or @entity8 moniker -- preexisting family friends and enemies , unwelcome comparisons to what came before , a sense that you ca n't be about " change " if you 've been around forever			1
and one more thing : fatigue -- as in , are n't we just too tired of these families to watch another replay in 2016 ? a longing for familiarity well , maybe			1
but @entity107 figures that one of the reasons we keep coming back to them is the familiarity we can also scorn			0
" it 's true that things are constantly changing and new names are arising all the time , but still there 's a longing for familiarity and celebrity that lasts through all of that , " he said			2
" it 's just like @entity169 or anywhere else			2
there are certain names that stick and people remember			0
" and close @entity8 ally @entity174 makes the case that @entity18 earned this on her own			1
" they do n't want @entity18 to run because her husband did a great job			1
they want her to run because they think she 'd be a great president , " @entity174 said			0
as for looking like yesterday instead of tomorrow , @entity174 argued that , " when you 're seeking to be the first woman president , it 's kind of impossible to paint you as the past			2
" the durability of the families is obvious			0
not only because they 're fixtures in @entity11 politics , but also because the younger generations have shown an aptitude for it as well -- @entity9 's son , @entity194 in @entity195 , and perhaps even @entity196 , who is n't ruling anything out these days			1
but if you call either of these families a dynasty , there 's pushback from the patriarchs			2
" a dynasty involves people who get jobs solely because of what their last name is , " @entity8 said in 2008 as @entity18 mounted her first presidential run			1
" the question is where she should be eliminated because she happened to have married me a long time ago ... this is not a blood deal			2
" @entity40 had a similar take in 1999 , standing next to his son @entity73 at the family compound in @entity215 , @entity216 , the day after he had announced his own @entity15 campaign			2
" we never felt we were entitled to something			0
dynasty at least connotes , has a connotation , of something coming your way , " he said			0
dynastic terminology @entity48 is one of the rare family members who seems to have no problem with the dynastic terminology			0
" i do n't have a problem with it			2
my mother does n't like to use the word ' dynasty ' because she thinks it 's elitist or whatever , " he told @entity1			2
" the fact that there happens to be name recognition or brand recognition of the @entity9 name or brand should n't be a handicap			1
" @entity36 tells the story of watching his mother 's candor on the " today " show when she and the family were preparing to leave for the opening of the @entity73 presidential library			2
" we were all watching @entity9 standing in the corner just like ... what 's your response to that ? i do n't know , " @entity36 recalls			1
" you know , @entity254 is just going to say what 's on her mind and she just really believes that it 's time for the country to look at different families , but it 's not going to affect @entity9 's decision			1
" for the @entity33 , the family 's political dominance is a matter of longevity and sheer size			2
for the @entity103 , it 's a newer business -- more of boutique operation			0
" it 's a powerhouse			0
it 's a law firm			0
it 's a political law firm and a powerful one , " @entity107 said			0
" the most powerful one in the country still			0
" will they run ? while @entity18 herself stays noncommittal about a potential second @entity15 run -- despite all of the activity on her behalf -- her backers seem to be gearing up for another @entity8 campaign			1
as for @entity9 , he 's continuing to travel the country on behalf of 2014 @entity284 candidates , collecting chits along the way			1
funders have shown more interest in his candidacy now that @entity292 gov. @entity291 's star has dimmed			0
as for @entity48 , it 's all in the family			0
he recounts a funny story about growing up @entity9			2
he was 8 and big brother , @entity40 , was 16			0
there was a @entity299 gun fight , and @entity36 lost â € ” getting shot in a most uncomfortable place			0
" when @entity45 became president , it was like the fulfillment of an expectation			0
he 's always been my hero			0
he 's always been mr. perfect , " @entity36 said of his father 's election in 1988			0
in the end , @entity36 admired what his brother @entity111 accomplished as president , but early on he could n't imagine it			0
to him , " @entity111 " was the the guy " who shot me in the ass			0

it 's hard to understate the depth of the @entity9 - @entity8 impact on @entity11 politics
for 32 years , there was either a @entity9 or a @entity8 in the @entity15 or the @entity16
a @entity9 - @entity18 2016 matchup would n't be the first time a @entity9 faced a @entity8
