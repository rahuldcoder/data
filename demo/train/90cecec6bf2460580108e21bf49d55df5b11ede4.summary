-- this week on " the @entity2 , " we take a look at what might have been @entity5 's worst week ever -- as a negative trifecta of scandals threaten to overwhelm his administration and derail his ambitious legislative agenda			1
we get a reality check with special guest , @entity12 rep. @entity11			1
and no talk about the biggest stories of the week would be complete without a conversation about @entity17 's decision to have a preemptive double mastectomy and the message it sends to millions			1
the scandals outweighed what might have otherwise have been regarded as a stretch of good news for @entity5 on the economy , with the @entity25 hitting historic highs and the @entity27 prediciing this week that the budget deficit will shrink to $ 642 billion			1
but these stories were quickly eclipsed			0
but the unwelcome addition of the @entity33 and @entity34 phone scandals have outraged even administration allies and led some critics to suggest that the second - term president 's agenda is now stalled			1
let 's look at the @entity33 first			1
it 's nobody favorite agency but the news that agents has inappropriately singled out conservative groups for additional scrutiny when applying for tax exempt status sent ripples of outrage through the political landscape			2
the fact that an inspector general report found no connection to the @entity52 and that none of the conservative groups were ultimately denied tax - exempt status provided cold comfort because of the chilling effect of the inquiry			0
the president fired the acting head of the @entity33 and a second high - ranking official , but congressional hearings are looming			2
( for some fun fireworks , @entity63 disagrees with my prescription for the problem : more @entity33 investigations on partisan political groups applying for tax - exempt status , with the crucial exception that those inquiries should be scrupulously nonpartisan			2
) the second scandal hit the press where it lived			0
the @entity34 was informed this week that the @entity75 had subpoenaed reporters ' phone records over a leak that the attorney general , @entity79 , said compromised national security and lives			1
that @entity82 had initially demanded the investigation for what they called election - year grandstanding by the @entity5 administration on its record against @entity89 did not stop their condemnation			0
but now that the press has found its privacy compromised , my guess is that there will be new scrutiny on this issue			0
the administration 's response was a renewed push for the media shield law			2
but make no mistake -- neither of these scandals is over			0
the big question is whether they will derail the president 's legislative agenda -- specifically , the goal of passing bipartisan immigration reform			0
@entity110 introduces our guest this week on " the @entity2 , " rep. @entity11 , @entity114 , who describes himself as " cautiously optimistic " on the chance for legislation to still move through in this polarized , hyperpartisan environment			1
his remarks offer a helpful and hopeful reality check from the perspective of someone working inside the @entity123			0
@entity63 leads this conversation about a new awareness about decisions women can make , armed with the information provided by genetic testing			0
@entity17 was able to determine that she had an overwhelmingly high chance of developing breast cancer and so the actress often described as " the sexiest woman in the world " opted to have a double mastectomy			1
beyond the issues of science and women 's health , we all agree that @entity17 's courageous actions are a positive example of how to leverage celebrity for the greater good			1
the @entity144 and @entity145 of the world should take notes			0
it 's a rare example of our celebrity - gossip - obsessed culture actually adding to the world 's intelligence rather than detracting from it			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity156			0
