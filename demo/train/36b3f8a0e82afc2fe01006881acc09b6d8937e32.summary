-- there 's a slight frisson in the mountain air ... that 's because the world 's best @entity6 racers are about to hurtle down the fastest downhill courses , tear up turns on the slalom , and grind through the super-g in pursuit of a dream far greater than a giant crystal globe and the overall title			1
so who is set to dominate next year on @entity18 's world stage ? who will be peaking at just the right time at the @entity21 ? and who is determined to etch their names into the history books ? here 's @entity0 's guide to the seven skiers to keep an eye on over the coming months			2
@entity29 last year we all watched with disbelief as the @entity34 ski star 's season dramatically unraveled			1
the 28 - year - old @entity29 had started the @entity6 season chasing @entity36 's record number of @entity38 victories , after making a promising start with wins in @entity41			1
in december her confidence was at such a high that she even spoke to @entity0 at the time about gutsy plans to legally contest the sports governing body , so that she might have the opportunity to race against the men			2
such optimism proved short lived			0
a stomach illness forced her to take a three - week absence from the circuit in january , during which she admitted to suffering with depression			0
she returned just in time for the @entity55 in @entity56 only to suffer a horrific fall in the super-g during her first race of the competition			2
airlifted to hospital , many thought her season and chances of making the @entity21 were over			0
@entity29 had hoped to be back for the new @entity38 ski season , which begins in the @entity67 resort of @entity68 this weekend , but the @entity70 gold medalist and four time overall world champion will not be able to take part as she continues her comeback from a serious knee injury			1
" i will go home to @entity77 and continue my preparation for the @entity80 races and my ultimate goal in february ! " she said on her website earlier this week			0
her ultimate goal in february is , of course , gold in @entity18			0
@entity85 an @entity6 season without @entity85 always feels a little flat , but next month the @entity34 skier who is loved by fans and loathed by coaches -- for his antics on and off - piste -- will be back from injury with his eyes firmly on the @entity70 podium			1
despite his reputation for his love of the good life , @entity85 has earned his pedigree as an incredible athlete and competitor after career wins of five @entity70 medals , five @entity55 and two overall titles			0
in november 2012 a persistent knee injury put him out of competition for the entire season and he 's been undergoing rehabilitation over the last year to be race fit for @entity18			1
ski fans are likely to see a different @entity85 this season			0
weighing some nine kilos lighter than in recent years , his troublesome knee is back in shape and he 's spoken out about how we wo n't be the go - for - broke skier of his youth			1
at 35 , he 'll be the oldest @entity34 @entity6 skier to compete in the @entity21 and if he wins , he 'll be the oldest @entity70 champion in @entity6			1
a tall order , but no doubt @entity85 will want to go out with a bang			0
@entity119 if @entity119 's form is even half as good as it was in the 2013 - 14 season , we 'll surely be seeing this @entity126 medal in @entity18			2
in april she ended the year as the world 's no. 1 female skier , wiping the board as the overall @entity38 champion with 11 victories and a record 2414 points			1
even before @entity29 's injury at the @entity55 in @entity56 , @entity119 had emerged as the @entity34 's toughest adversary in years , and now we 'll have the chance to see the world 's two best female skiers compete for the first time on an @entity70 platform			1
there 's reportedly no love lost between the two off - piste either - so expect some fireworks			0
@entity145 teen sensation @entity145 blasted onto the scene last season to become the youngest @entity38 slalom champion since 1974			2
she 's been dubbed a " mini-lindsey " due to the fact that she hails from the same town -- @entity77 , @entity152 -- and also been labeled an @entity34 sweetheart			1
but beware @entity145 is a fierce competitor			0
and if she can handle the hype , a slalom gold is a strong possibility in @entity18			0
@entity157 like @entity159 wood , @entity157 is big , strong and heavy			0
hardly surprising then that his best performance should be in the speed disciplines @entity162 and downhill , which are best suited to strong , endurance skiers			0
after taking the @entity38 titles in both last season , he 'll be sizing up the course in @entity18 which has been generating buzz for the sheer size of its jumps and long , hard terrain -- a suitable gauntlet for this @entity159 pillar			2
@entity175 there is something of the " terminator " about @entity175 -- and not just because he 's a muscly @entity67			1
@entity175 's skiing has always been clinical , technical and deadly to opponents which he proved once again when he took the overall world title last season for the second time in his career			2
he maintained a run of 18 podium appearances in 19 races in the two technical events -- slalom and giant slalom -- matching the legendary @entity193 's record in the process			0
@entity195 to say @entity195 's 2013 season was a breakthrough year would be an understatement			1
at the season opener in @entity68 the 31 - year - old @entity34 set the tone winning by a record breaking 2.75 second margin in the giant slalom , and then went on to decimate all competition for the rest of the season winning all but two @entity208 events on his way to becoming the @entity38 champion			1
in the midst of this career peak , he also became the first man since @entity216 in 1968 to take three gold medals at the @entity55 but can he do it again ?			0

skiing 's @entity38 's first event held this weekend at @entity68 in @entity67
@entity34 downhill skier @entity29 misses out due to injury
