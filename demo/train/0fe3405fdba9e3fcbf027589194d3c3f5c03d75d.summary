-- a large , hanging and then collapsing chunk of ice is likely the reason why two @entity7 climbers died in @entity8 , an investigator said monday			1
the bodies of @entity10 and @entity11 were found two days earlier , a heartbreaking end to a high - tech search			1
the men disappeared while attempting to scale the south face of @entity16 , a 6,110 - meter ( 20,000 - foot ) tall mountain located in @entity18 , a region popular with climbers			2
@entity20 , who coordinated an investigation and effort to find the men , said @entity10 and @entity11 made it to the summit and ran into trouble on their way down			1
evidence suggests that one of the men likely went to look over a serac -- a large block of ice -- to see if they could descend			2
something gave out , causing the climber to fall some 65 feet , said @entity20			2
but because the men would have been tethered together , that first fall likely pulled the other man off the edge , which sent them both spiraling off a large cliff			2
" their equipment was strewn over the glacier			1
there was sign of great impact			0
( it ) would lead us to believe that they did fall			0
my guess , looking at the photos and from talking to our guys out there that it was probably about a 1,000 - foot fall , " @entity20 said			0
@entity11 , 29 , was the founder of @entity55 , a company consisting of professional guides , logistical experts and photographers			1

" on july 10 , @entity10 , 32 , posted pictures and a chronicle of experiences in @entity8 on the climbing blog @entity69			1
" the @entity70 is world renowned for its high altitude mountaineering , " he wrote			0
" but almost as awesome as the mountains themselves is the motley crew of international climbers who come to try their hand at getting high , on big peaks , cheap and fast			0
" @entity78 , who heads the technology company @entity79 that uses satellite imagery , said he enlisted the help of climbers and technology experts to find the pair using an application he built , with hundreds of people at one point poring through satellite images looking for signs of an avalanche			0
that information was then sent to search and rescue crews on the ground in @entity8			0
@entity10 and @entity11 were extremely fit and experienced climbers , having practiced the sport for more than a decade , according to @entity78			1
@entity11 had been to @entity8 several times before , though this was @entity10 's first such visit			1
" @entity11 had the most optimistic view on practically everything , " @entity11 's sister @entity98 told @entity0			1
" i think it 's really important to understand that you have to make the most of what you 've got , and you 've got to be grateful for everyone in your life			0
