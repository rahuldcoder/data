-- like many big cities in @entity3 , @entity1 is surrounded by a circular highway that connects with various freeway arteries that go through the downtown area			1
weekday mornings and early evenings , no matter which highway you 're on , or what direction you 're going , you 'll likely end up stuck in some hot traffic hell			1
@entity12 , 26 , used to drive from the south end of the city by the airport to a northern suburb at peak commuting times , right through the daily mess			1
" there were so many people out , " @entity12 says			1
" you get road rage because nobody will let you in ; nobody will merge right			2
" despite the perils of a long commute , most people in the @entity3 drive to work , according to the @entity30 ( @entity31 )			1
in fact , more than 75 % of @entity3 make the trek to work alone			1
the stress of waiting in gridlock can get intense if you 're in a hurry , leaving you feeling frustrated and anxious about the traffic			2
that stress can translate into deeper health hazards			2
try to distract yourself with your smartphone , and you can put yourself and other drivers in even more danger			2
longer commutes may steal health and fitness road rage : an ' emotional spin cycle ' @entity49 was sitting in gridlocked traffic , waiting to get on an on - ramp , in a line of cars that had pulled over to let an ambulance pass			1
suddenly , another driver darted out behind @entity56 to tail the ambulance , taking advantage of the cars that had been moved , to enter the freeway			2
" that incensed me , " says @entity49 , who makes a lengthy commute from @entity62 , @entity63 , to @entity1 -- about a 70 - mile trip -- three days a week			1
" i immediately flew into a rage over it			2
" that happened a couple months ago , and @entity49 still sounds irritated when she describes it			2
she does n't act aggressively toward other drivers , but she does get bothered by disrespectful behavior on the road			2
it 's easy to get lost in a cycle of emotions where you 're talking to yourself and ruminating about traffic situations , says @entity78 , professor of psychology at the @entity80 and co-author of " @entity82 and @entity83			2
" " impatience , if you do n't handle it at the beginning , tends to turn into resentment and anger , " @entity78 says			1
the back seat of the car is what @entity78 calls the " road rage nursery			2
" it 's where kids hear their parents cursing out other drivers and expressing their disbelief about everyone else 's poor skills on the road			2
children learn the culture of aggressive driving in this way , he says			2
" we use it as an opportunity to disrespect everything and say bad words that we would be shocked to say in any other place			0
" another problem is that after a bad commute , people tend not to let it go , @entity78 says			1
they walk into the office and complain about their experiences , which leads to entire conversations about bad traffic and bad drivers			0
this venting may feel good in the moment , but it reinforces the emotions for the next driving trip , he says			0
@entity78 ' solution : monitor your traffic emotions			0
you might try keeping a diary of how you feel every day after your commute , or just keep a mental note about your state of mind			1
what are your negative thoughts while on the road ? are they justified ? confronting your internal dialogue about commuting frustrations may help			0
you may realize that your negative thoughts may not be proportional to the offenses you perceive from other drivers			0
@entity78 recommends asking yourself : " am i the kind of person who thinks these things about people ? " and " is this the kind of person i want to be ? " suicides outpace car crashes as leading cause of death from injuries stress : when driving kills slowly traffic situations may trigger in us primal instincts that evolved in humans to promote survival , so that we can protect ourselves against threats , experts say			1
the " aggressive , combative , competitive frame for driving " may be linked to our evolutionary past , but it could have implications for cardiovascular disease , says @entity169 , a psychology professor at the @entity170			1
in one experiment , @entity169 and colleagues ran a simulation where people drove under the assumption that they were late to a meeting , and there was a financial incentive to get there before other people			1
one group drove in high - density traffic , another had an easier traffic environment			1
some people were told there was a time limit			1
men more then women got into aggressive driving mode , showing an elevated blood pressure when under pressure to weave their way through heavy traffic			1
in general , both men and women who adopt an aggressive driving persona seem to show this , @entity169 says			0
" in the simulator studies we 've done , they 'll actually start driving by cars and flipping them off and honking at them , " @entity169 says			0
" that 's just a computer , a computer rendition ! " long - term stress increases the risk of cardiovascular disease , he says			1
research on the precise level of cardiovascular risk is limited , but recent data does n't paint a flattering picture for the vehicular commuter			0
a 2012 study in the @entity219 found that the farther people commute by vehicle , the higher their blood pressure and body mass index is likely to be			1
also , the farther the commute , the less physical activity the person was likely to get			1
experts recommend making the extra effort to avoid peak driving hours			1
you may even end up getting home at the same time as if you had left earlier			0
" maybe it is better off to say , ' i 'm going to put the radio on a station that 's nice , and kind of chill out for the 30 or 40 minutes , rather than aggressively try to get home and beat everyone else , ' " @entity169 says			0
distractions : when driving kills quickly people get bored while driving for a long time			1
they want something else going on while they 're just looking at cars crawling around them			0
but some forms of entertainment are far more dangerous than others			0
@entity169 and colleagues used a driving simulator to look at just how distracting technology can be in the car			0
a 2008 study from his group , published in the @entity252 : @entity253 , found that people made more errors driving while talking on a cell phone than while chatting with another passenger			1
the impact of those errors is more than you might imagine			0
the researchers showed in a 2006 study ( @entity31 ) that talking on a cell phone , in terms of how it impairs driving , is comparable to a blood alcohol level of .08 , which is the legal limit in the @entity3			1
about one in three fatalities on the road can be linked to some kind of distraction ; some estimates put this figure even higher , @entity169 says			1
distractions in your car can slow everyone else down , too , @entity169 says			0
computer modeling shows that if one car is not keeping up with the flow of traffic , the number of vehicles per lane , per hour , declines as more drivers are distracted			0
that can add precious minutes onto the commute you 're complaining is too long anyway			1
we all know that texting while driving is risky			0
but even hands - free , voice - activated interaction with phones can be distracting , @entity169 says			0
some conversations are not mundane -- you may find yourself in a heated argument or in the middle of a breakup talk ( not to mention a breakup text )			1
what are the precise demands on your brain with voice - activated systems and what are the consequences of that ? @entity304 , research scientist at the @entity305 and associate director of the @entity308 @entity307 , is looking into this question			0
@entity304 is working with @entity311 's @entity310 to study the visual and nonvisual demands of your attention while driving			1
results should be out sometime next year			0
" if you feel anxiety and your phone goes off , that 's a problem , " @entity169 says			0
with all of the notifications barraging our smartphones from e-mail , text , social media and calendars , " it 's a little unclear what long - term consequences of that are			1
" changing your commute ? after several years , the daily drive to and from work in high - traffic areas can really get under some people 's skin			1
" it was something that was taking an enormous toll on my overall happiness , on my ability to deal with stress , on the amount of free time that i had , " says @entity337 , who used to live in @entity1 and worked for @entity338 in the 1990s			0
it was n't until @entity337 moved to @entity348 and found himself in a similarly perilous commuting situation that he realized how much the driving was affecting him			0
he made a bold choice : centralizing where he lives and works			0
@entity337 now lives in a more urban neighborhood of @entity348 , where he can walk and bike around			0
in the warmer months , he 'll ride a motor scooter , and two weeks might pass without him using a car			0
since he is a contractor , @entity337 can be selective about which companies he works for based on travel time			0
( he 'll accept longer commutes if they 're short - term commitments			1
) " having lived the way i live now , you could n't pay me enough for me to live out in the suburbs , or live anywhere , and commit to a 45 - minute or hourlong commute every day , " he says			2
" there 's no amount of money that i would accept to do that			0
" but there are plenty of people who do n't -- or ca n't -- draw that line			1
@entity372 is the principal of an elementary school and drives 55 miles through @entity374 to get to work monday through friday			2
she 'll leave later in the evening to avoid traffic , but " your life is either on the road or at work			2
" and @entity49 says she loves her job enough to make the trek from @entity62 three times a week			0
podcasts and audio books help her get through			0
" i would never say that this is fun , " she says of her commute			2
" i feel like i 've done a good job of making it more enjoyable			0
i 'm really good at knowing what 's going to make me happy for two hours			0

despite the perils of a long commute , most people in the @entity3 drive to work
