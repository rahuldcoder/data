@entity0 and @entity2 are through to the quarterfinals of the 2015 @entity4 at the expense of @entity6 and @entity7 after a dramatic conclusion to the competition 's " @entity10 " tuesday			1
all four teams had a chance of qualifying before kick - off with @entity6 requiring just a point to be sure of their passage to the next stage			1
however , a 2 - 0 defeat at the hands of @entity0 coupled with @entity2 's late 2 - 1 win over @entity7 ensured @entity23 's men would not be progressing from @entity24 playing an unimaginative brand of long ball football and with little shape in attack or defense , @entity6 's demise seldom looked in doubt in @entity32 @entity0 had the chance to open the scoring after just 90 seconds but a terrible touch from @entity36 when through on goal allowed @entity6 goalkeeper @entity38 to smother			1
the pre-tournament favourite would not have to wait long to break the deadlock , however			0
aided by some lackadaisical defending , @entity41 controlled a simple ball over the top before composing himself and calmly slotting beyond @entity45			1
@entity0 was dominant and @entity46 took his turn to test @entity45 with a rasping shot from distance after 20 minutes			2
@entity23 had warned his players before the game that nothing was settled despite their advantage atop the group			0
and as the half wore on the @entity57 's side began to edge their way into the contest			0
@entity60 stung the palms of @entity62 in the @entity0 goal with a long range effort as halftime approached			2
yet @entity6 looked vulnerable on the break when pushing forward			2
this pattern would come to define much of the second half			0
@entity6 brought on @entity70 striker @entity69 as they searched for an equalizer and they made early headway as @entity75 almost latched on to a @entity77 cutback			2
@entity0 withstood this early pressure and came close to doubling their advantage after 73 minutes			0
@entity82 's strike from the edge of the area beat @entity45 but not @entity85 who had fallen back to station himself on the line			0
ten minutes later though there was nothing @entity45 or his defenders could do as @entity92 found himself free on the edge of the @entity6 area			1
the @entity95 midfielder composed himself and fired an unstoppable shot into the bottom right hand corner to make sure of the victory and top spot in the group			0
@entity0 's triumph meant @entity2 required a win over @entity7 in @entity103 to leapfrog @entity6 in the standings and book their place in the quarterfinals			1
but things did n't start too brightly for the @entity2 as @entity108 broke the deadlock for @entity7 with a stunning volley after 15 minutes			1
aware that two goals were required , @entity2 poured forward but were faced with a resolute @entity7 rear - guard			1
@entity113 restored parity after 73 minutes , latching on to a mishit @entity116 shot before swiveling to rattle beyond @entity117			0
@entity2 then struck a post moments later as they searched for the go - ahead - goal that would take them through			1
that would arrive with just seven minutes remaining			0
@entity116 was left alone in the @entity7 box and rose to flick @entity125 's cross past the despairing @entity117 and send his country through .			0

@entity2 and @entity0 reach @entity4 2015 quarterfinals
@entity0 defeat @entity6 2 - 0 in @entity32 thanks to goals from @entity41 and @entity92
@entity2 leave it late to triumph over @entity7 in @entity103
