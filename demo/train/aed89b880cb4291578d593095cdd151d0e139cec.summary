@entity0 , @entity1 -- follow @entity3 out onto a dock and ask him about the view			1
" there 's this pylon here and there 's an object about 20 feet away -- here -- and another one , about 50 feet away , " says @entity3 , overlooking a bay in coastal @entity1 during the recent @entity8 conference , where he was a featured speaker			1
" i guess those are boats			2
i ca n't tell from this distance , really , but they 're solid and we 're on the water -- so it stands to reason			2
" @entity3 is completely blind -- he lost sight in both eyes by age 13 months			1
yet he uses his ears to see			2
when he walks around unfamiliar places -- he loves hiking -- he clicks his tongue and then listens as that sound bounces off nearby objects			1
he says he 's trained his brain to turn these sounds into an image of sorts -- an auditory map he follows with the help of a cane			0
" when you send out a sonar call ... you 're interrogating the environment , " he said			0
" you 're asking , ' where are you ? ' and ' what are you ? ' and the environment answers back			0
" @entity3 is the founder of a nonprofit called @entity46			1
his goal is to teach this technique of " human echolocation " -- or seeing the world through sound -- to blind people all over the world			1
so far , the group has taught at least 500 blind children to see with their ears			1
" it is n't that difficult to teach			0
it really is n't , " he said			0
" i believe that the brain is already at least partly wired to do this			0
all that needs to happen is the hardware needs to be awakened			0
it needs to be activated , and we believe we 've found ways of doing this			0
" not everyone believes him			0
" many of @entity3 's colleagues believe that echolocation , if it 's taught , should remain a secondary skill for the blind , " @entity70 wrote at @entity71			1
" and some disability advocates worry that all the hoopla over sonar makes blind people seem like superhuman freaks , with special powers that more than compensate for their problems			1
" in a presentation at @entity8 , a conference about new ideas in science and technology , @entity3 describes himself as a " real - life batman " and showed videos of his blind students riding mountain bikes through obstacle courses , playing basketball and skateboarding			1
" but he sees the technique as much more than a gimmick			2
" this is not aiming at making our students daredevils or ' super-blind ' or anything like that , " he said			0
" it 's really aimed at opening opportunities and helping students ... to lead day - to - day lives			0
" on the controversy surrounding his teaching , he added : " i think that has a lot to do with a dogmatic adherence to tradition -- if it ai n't broke , why fix it			0
" @entity3 , who lost both his eyes to cancer when he was an infant , says something is broken with the way blind students all over the world learn			1
by and large , they 're taught to be dependent on sighted people -- in part because 99 % of them , he said , are taught by people who can see			2
@entity3 aims to liberate students			1
by clicking their tongues and listening for echos from buildings , cars , dogs and the like , he believes they can be less dependent on sighted people			2
" our view is that should one solicit assistance , that one should do so out of a matter of personal choice rather than being cornered into it , " he said			0
if you saw @entity3 walking down the street you 'd hear him make repeated clicking sounds with his tongue -- click ! click ! click ! -- as he weaves through traffic or ducks to miss tree branches			1
the clicks usually are n't terribly loud , but they come at a continuous clip			2
he makes the sound more often when he 's a bit confused or comes to an intersection			2
other times he 's silent as he walks with the help of a cane			0
@entity3 is quick to eschew instructions from those who travel with him , said @entity157 , who worked with @entity3 at the @entity8 event			1
@entity3 admits that echolocation is n't perfect			1
other creatures that use sonar to see , such as bats , emit ultrasonic frequencies			0
humans , of course , ca n't do that			0
" a bat can determine an object the size of a gnat from so many meters away , " he said			0
" for me , the object has to be at least the size of a softball			0
so bats definitely have the edge on humans in terms of their use of ultrasound			0
" @entity3 founded @entity46 in 2000			1
so far , he has n't has n't found much interest from groups in the @entity181			0
of 50 schools for the blind his group has contacted , only two have expressed interest in teaching echolocation , he said			1
similarly , of 1,300 agencies that deal with issues relating to blindness , only 10 wanted to work with @entity46 , he said			1
@entity3 , however , seems undeterred			2
he 's been clicking his tongue as a way to see for as long as he can remember -- it 's an adaptation , he says , to the fact that his parents raised him just like they would have any sighted child			2
they did n't give him a break because he experienced the world through other senses			0
and he 's on a breakneck world tour evangelizing for the idea			0
" it 's like seeing with dim flashes of light , " he said of the tongue - click method			1
those dim flashes are enough , he says , to change a person 's life -- allowing him or her to go hiking alone , ride a bike or do something as simple as enjoying a view of the coast			1
not allowing blind people a chance to do these things , he said , would be " very shortsighted			1

@entity3 teaches a technique to help blind people " see " with their ears
@entity3 clicks his tongue and listens for that sound to bounce off of objects
he says those returning echoes act like " dim flashes of light "
@entity3 is founder of @entity46 , which teaches " echolocation "
