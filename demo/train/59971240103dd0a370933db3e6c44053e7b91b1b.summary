-- chicana author @entity1 is perhaps best - known for her 1984 coming of age novel , " @entity2 , " a story about a young @entity4 who leaves behind her barrio for a chance at a better life			1
the novel , also released in @entity10 , has sold more than 4 million copies and is a considered a classic of @entity14 literature			1
but not everyone is a fan , specifically the @entity16 in @entity17 , which banned @entity1 ' book in its suspension of its @entity20			1
it still bewilders @entity1 and her fans : how can a character who spends most of her time at the library and shares her experiences with her mother and blind aunt offend a school district ? @entity1 is on a national book tour this month for " have you seen @entity31 ? " a tale about a woman 's search for a cat who goes missing in the wake of her mother 's death			1
it 's a fable for grieving grown - ups , and at less than 100 pages , she hopes the book will be medicine for hearts broken from loss			2
@entity48 - based artist @entity47 , known for her depiction of @entity4 and @entity14 women through prints and pastels , represented the unique and colorful characters , all based on @entity1 ' neighbors			1
they make up the quirky @entity57 district of @entity58 , @entity59 , where the story is based			2
cisneros tell us what inspired the tale , why she is planning a move to @entity67 and how she feels about her famous book being banned			1
@entity0 : what inspired you to write " have you seen @entity31 ? " @entity1 : i was working on the 25th anniversary tour of " @entity2			1
" i wanted to make a small book that people could have or give to someone in a place of grief			2
my mother had just passed , but i still felt the need to create something			0
my friend and artist of the book , @entity47 , had just lost her mother too , and i proposed that she join me , and she very reluctantly joined the project			2
@entity0 : what do you want your readers to take away after reading this book ? @entity1 : i hope that they understand that when they are in a time of grief , there is something to be gained during the time , even though we tend to focus on what we 've lost			1
but when you have your heart broken wide , you are also open to things of beauty as well as things of sadness			0
once people are not here physically , the spiritual remains , we still connect , we can communicate , we can give and receive love and forgiveness			0
there is love after someone dies			0
@entity0 : were you surprised to hear that " @entity2 " was the list of banned books in @entity17 ? have you ever considered yourself a controversial writer ? @entity1 : gosh , no ! i do n't think they read the books			1
they just eliminated the entire whole @entity120 - @entity119 studies without thinking			0
it should be called @entity119 studies , and all the books should be re-introduced			0
then there would be less of an uproar			0
the fact that there is a hyphen there tells you a lot about our times			0
and our whole relationship with @entity67 , which has always been very controversial , especially now			1
@entity0 : there has been talk about you wanting to improve your @entity10 ; is that true ? and por qué ? @entity1 : what 's always a challenge for me is that my @entity10 is not the level of my @entity143			1
nor do i read in @entity10 the way i read in @entity143			1
i want my @entity10 to be like that of a newscaster			1
... that 's a different kind of @entity10			2
i feel comfortable in @entity10 , i chat like a parrot , but i do n't have the confidence in @entity10 that i do in @entity143			2
i 'm perfectly fine in the mercado , and i can make people laugh and tell a story , but my vocabulary is limited			0
for example , i do n't know the @entity10 word for " contractor			2
" but i 'm going to @entity67 to live for a year ! this is the first time i 'm going to live there			1
i just need to be in an environment where all i hear is @entity10			1
@entity0 : there 's a lot of debate of whether or not knowing @entity10 makes you a " less @entity4			2
" how do you feel about that ? @entity1 : it does n't make you less			2
you are just missing out on one of your senses if you do n't have the language			0
it 's like not having any taste buds			0
you are missing out on the pleasure of @entity4 food			0
the more you speak more languages , the more you understand about yourself			0
it 's like being blind			0
you are n't less of a person , but you 're missing out on wonderful things			0
@entity0 : finally , what you are reading right now ? @entity1 : i 'm read essays , poetry , fiction , art books and more all at the same time ! on my various bookshelves in my home are : " the five acts of @entity186 : a novel " by @entity188 ; " @entity189 " by @entity190 and " @entity191 " by @entity192 ; " @entity193 , @entity194 and @entity195 " by @entity196 ; " @entity197 " by @entity198 and " looking for @entity199 " by @entity200			1
and i just finished @entity202 's " @entity201 : two worlds , one childhood			0
" is that a lot ?			0
