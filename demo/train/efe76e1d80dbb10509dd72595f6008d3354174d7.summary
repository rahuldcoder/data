@entity0 , @entity1 -- is @entity4 president @entity3 an opportunist , grabbing at chances to poke the @entity7 in the eye , or a clever strategist with the longer - term goal of restoring a greater @entity4 ? is he simply riding a tide of @entity4 patriotic fervor over @entity1 ? is he a rational actor aware of the delicate balances within the international system , or as one observer put it , " drunk on power " and oblivious to sanctions ? these are the questions preoccupying western governments and @entity4 's neighbors , after the swift annexation of @entity1 and @entity4 military maneuvers close to the @entity26 border			1
there were some tantalizing clues in @entity3 's pugnacious speech to the @entity30 this week			2
he described the fall of the @entity32 as unfortunate -- because it had separated @entity4			2
" the @entity4 nation became one of the biggest , if not the biggest ethnic group in the world to be divided by borders , " he said			2
" it was only when @entity1 ended up as part of a different country that @entity4 realized that it was not simply robbed , it was plundered			1
" he went on to say , " if you compress the spring all the way to its limit , it will snap back hard			0
" heady , populist rhetoric -- but it has propelled the @entity4 president to his highest approval rating -- 71 % -- in recent years , according to the @entity48			1
@entity3 said @entity4 had no intention of violating @entity26 's sovereignty ( beyond the 5 % of its territory it has absorbed this week			1
) " do not believe those who want you to fear @entity4 , shouting that other regions will follow @entity1 , " he told @entity26			1
but he then said this : " it should be above all in @entity26 's own interest to ensure that these people 's rights and interests are fully protected			0
this is the guarantee of @entity26 's state stability and territorial integrity			0
" in other words , if the @entity65 believes @entity4 are being discriminated against , @entity26 's independence is no longer assured			2
those words will have echoed across parts of the @entity68 with large @entity4 populations : @entity70 ( 10 % ) , @entity71 ( 6 % ) , @entity72 ( 27 % ) and @entity73 ( 25 % )			2
will the @entity4 region of @entity75 in @entity70 begin agitating for its own referendum ? will oblasts ( regions ) of eastern @entity26 demand their own vote ? @entity75 is already beyond the control of the @entity70 government			2
just as a statue of @entity83 overlooks the main square in the @entity1 capital , @entity0 , so another stands outside @entity75 's regional assembly in @entity88			2
in a 2006 referendum more than 95 % of voters said they wanted to be reunited with @entity4			2
the assumption at @entity93 headquarters is that @entity3 wo n't stop at @entity1			1
secretary general @entity100 described the annexation of @entity1 as " 21st century revisionism , attempts to turn back the clock , to draw new dividing lines on our map , to monopolize markets , subdue populations			2
" @entity93 has already stepped up air policing over the @entity104 -- all members of the @entity106			0
nor does the @entity107 see @entity1 as @entity3 's end - game			1
in imposing sanctions against figures close to @entity3 , president @entity109 stressed thursday that further @entity4 incursions would trigger a third round of sanctions targeting key sectors of the @entity4 economy			1
one of @entity3 's reasons for ignoring the warnings so far is history , as he made clear in front of the @entity30			0
on @entity124 , @entity93 expansion , @entity122 and other issues , he said , the @entity7 had lied to and deceived @entity4			1
he did n't use the word payback , but he did n't need to			0
gradually , @entity127 governments have taken power around @entity4 , across the @entity104 , now in @entity26 -- feeding the age - old @entity4 fear of encirlement			1
indeed @entity3 asked the @entity30 this week : what if @entity133 in @entity1 -- with its glorious place in @entity4 military history -- had become a @entity93 base within @entity26 ? a line had to be drawn			1
but that line has only hastened the signing of @entity26 's association agreement with the @entity140			0
in signing the agreement friday , the president of the @entity142 , @entity141 , pointedly said it was a response to " the popular yearning for a decent life as a nation , for a @entity149 way of life			0
" the subtext was that @entity3 's @entity4 was on the wrong side of history -- anti-democratic , corrupt , without values			1
@entity3 's clique another reason for @entity3 's embrace of high - octane nationalism , according to some analysts , is that he increasingly relies on a small inner circle , where there are few voices of caution or dissent			1
there was a sign of this when @entity4 foreign minister @entity168 met @entity170 secretary of state @entity169 in @entity171 recently			0
@entity170 officials were surprised that @entity168 -- despite his enormous experience -- had no mandate to negotiate or even discuss aspects of the crisis			0
@entity168 announced friday that the president would personally supervize the reintegration of @entity1			1
@entity179 was known to speak his mind as finance minister from 2000 - 2011			0
he believes the consequences of sanctions and market anxiety may cost @entity4 $ 200 billion this year in capital flight			0
the ruble has already lost 10 % of its value this year and the credit rating agency @entity188 's said friday that " since @entity170 and @entity140 banks and investors may well be reluctant to lend to @entity4 under the current circumstances , the economy may slow further and the private sector may require official support			0
" economists now expect the @entity4 economy to stagnate and perhaps slide into recession			0
that hurts people closest to the @entity4 president , the billionaires who control large chunks of the @entity4 economy			1
major companies like @entity204 and state banks like @entity206 need access to capital markets			0
will @entity3 feel their pain , or must the oligarchs also make patriotic sacrifices ? another unknown is whether the @entity65 feels the @entity7 has the stomach for serious , lasting sanctions			1
after the @entity4 incursion into @entity217 in 2008 , when @entity218 was essentially annexed , there was brief and mild retribution			0
the list of individuals sanctioned by the @entity170 and @entity140 this time round may make a greater impact			0
but the avenues for dialogue - through @entity93 , the @entity140 , the @entity226 , the @entity227 -- are closing down			0
" business as usual , " says @entity93 chief @entity100 , " is not an option			0
" perhaps the biggest question is whether @entity3 accepts that @entity4 in the 21st century must be fully integrated into the international economy -- as a member of the @entity233 , with a convertible currency and a rule of law that allows and encourages companies to do business there			1
or does he believe @entity4 is strong enough to stand aloof in the knowledge that the world ( and especially @entity149 ) ca n't do without its oil , gas and minerals ? similarly , does he see the value of international co-operation on @entity247 's nuclear program or @entity248 ? @entity4 has no desire to see a nuclear - armed @entity247 , nor @entity248 taken over by jihadist militants			1
but co-operation with the @entity7 does not follow			0
despite the fact that his " cashiers " are now sanctioned , and his attempts to prevent @entity26 from drifting westward have backfired , @entity3 's muscular defiance -- so popular at home and in @entity1 -- portrays the @entity7 as @entity4 's natural adversary , not its potential partner .			1

@entity4 president approval ratings are at highest in recent years
analysts are asking if he is a rational actor , or " drunk on power "
assumption at @entity93 headquarters is that @entity3 wo n't stop at @entity1
@entity4 businesses will suffer as @entity3 portrays @entity7 as adversary not potential partner
