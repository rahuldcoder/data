@entity0 , @entity1 -- it 's the week before finals at the @entity6 in @entity0 , and all over campus , students are hunched over books and laptops under the shelter of immense palm trees and sprawled out on the cement benches lining the campus ' long , grassy mall , the anticipation palpable			1
elsewhere , in the @entity17 , graduate student @entity16 sits in a windowless office that could have been a closet in a previous life , immersed in a different kind of work : he is sending a statement condemning @entity1 's new anti-illegal immigration law to the media and other opponents of @entity27			1
" as students , we have a responsibility to fight this law through action and to raise our voices so those in power hear us , " he said			2
" the time has come for us to stop talking about it and be about it			2
" @entity16 is one of many student activists in @entity1 and across the country leading the charge to kill @entity27 before it takes effect this summer			1
the law requires immigrants to carry their alien registration documents at all times and requires police to question people if there is reason to suspect they 're in the @entity51 illegally			0
it also targets those who hire illegal immigrant day laborers or knowingly transport them			0
tea partiers to illegal immigrants : ' sign guestbook ' the letter , which @entity16 and his cohorts are circulating as a petition , sums up the sentiments of many students			1
the 12 students of various ethnicities who spoke with @entity2 said they did not support the bill , citing concerns that the law would promote racial profiling and foster an environment of fear and paranoia among @entity72 , whether they are in the country legally or not			1
" we believe that it is a law based in fear and racism			0
the law targets not only immigrants , but all @entity80 ( even those who are @entity51 citizens ) as well as any @entity51 citizen who may associate with members of either group , " the letter states			0
" we want to halt the prejudicial momentum of @entity1 's legislators and keep the campus of the @entity6 a free , safe place for persons of all races , backgrounds and ethnicities			1
" the students ' views are also a microcosm of the broader opposition nationwide to the bill , which gov. @entity98 signed into law friday , citing concerns over crime and the failure of the federal government to regulate immigration			1
dozens of protests have been staged nationwide , including in @entity0 , where hundreds gathered outside the state capitol as the bill was being signed			1
what will @entity1 immigration law do ? " it was incredible to see that the vast majority of those assembled were young people , some as young as high school , " professor @entity112 said			2
" to many of them , who may have parents who are illegal or have relatives that live in @entity124 , this is more than just a law ; this is personal			0
this is a threat to their families			0
this could tear them apart			0
" students have been at the forefront of the major social movements of the past century , but the advent of social networking tools such as @entity137 and @entity138 allows them to organize at a faster and more efficient rate			2
" the internet really helps us reach a wide audience with the most up - to - date information , " said student coordinator @entity140 , one of many who helped organize the protest at the capitol			2
" now that the bill has passed , this is just the beginning			2
" @entity151 : share your thoughts on immigration policy some critics of the bill are threatening legal action ; others are pledging to boycott travel and business in @entity1 unless they overturn the legislation			1
at the @entity6 this week , resistance took the form of @entity164 , a series of programs and information sessions organized by @entity140 and others that included meetings on how the law works and an open forum for students to share their struggles with immigration			1
" in my community , everyone has a sense of persecution			0
we 're living in a constant state of fear , " said @entity180 , 21 , a @entity124 - born @entity51 citizen whose family lives in @entity182			2
" the law is instilling fear and limiting people from going out and doing chores , which will eventually have a direct economic impact on the community , too			0
" even students who support immigration reform called the law ill - conceived			1
" i can see how something needs to be done about illegal immigration , but this is taking it too far , " said @entity194 , a 21 - year - old film major			1
" they say there wo n't be racial profiling , but i do n't see how you can look past it			0
" supporters of the bill point to language stating that officers can not stop someone solely based on race , ethnicity and country of origin			2
read the full text of @entity27 ( @entity214 ) but student body representative @entity215 said the word " solely " leaves the door open for race to be among the reasons that influences an officer 's decision to detain someone			1
" i see a definite separation , a disjoint between @entity80 and law enforcement , " @entity215 said			0
" like they said on ' @entity226 , ' there 's nothing more @entity228 than ' can i see your papers ? ' " people also worry that the law will further marginalize undocumented immigrants by discouraging them from reporting crimes , accidents or injuries			0
" it really worries me that this will increase public health issues and make them worse for women and children who might too scared of being deported to go to the hospital or to police if something happens to them , " said @entity237 , a public health major			0
" it really scares me to think about the long - term implications of this bill			1
" @entity237 and other students said they planned to continue attending protests such as the one @entity16 and his collaborators are setting up wednesday , when they plan to present their petition to the school 's president to sign			1
" we want him to publicly state his support for our position in a show of solidarity , " he said			0
" we need to come together to fight this			0
there 's strength in numbers			0
