-- want to read that e-book or play @entity2 while taxiing to the runway ? add @entity4 to the list of @entity7 airlines that have received @entity9 approval to allow passengers to use many portable electronic devices in all phases of flight			1
@entity4 ' move wednesday came three weeks after the @entity9 announced the loosening of electronics rules aboard aircraft			1
under the new rules , passengers may use certain electronic devices in " airplane mode " during taxiing , takeoff and landing			2
each airline has to prove to the @entity9 that devices are safe to use in airplane mode on its aircraft			1
@entity28 and @entity29 moved quickly to get @entity9 approval to allow devices on board on november 1			1
@entity33 implemented the policy change november 4			2
@entity35 unveiled its policy change november 6 , and @entity37 announced its change november 7			1
other airlines are moving to get @entity9 approval to allow greater electronic use			2
@entity41 said it hopes to allow devices in all phases of flight this month			2
" we 're in the process of applying through the new process and hope to implement the changes as soon as possible , with the goal of having the change live in november -- in time for the holidays , " @entity41 spokeswoman @entity45 wrote in an e-mail			0
@entity54 was less specific about its time frame			0
" we are in the process of coordinating with the @entity9			0
i do n't have a specific implementation date at this time , " @entity54 spokeswoman @entity57 wrote in an e-mail			0
with such a new policy , some confusion exists about what 's still permitted on board			2
@entity37 reminded passengers of some restrictions that remain in place			1
the airline noted that the eased restrictions apply only to domestic flights flown by its " mainline " aircraft , which means partner airline flights ( such as @entity74 flights ) are not included			1
those airlines have to get their own @entity9 approval			0
smartphones and other devices must be operated in airplane mode or with cellular services disabled			0
the new expanded use of electronics does not apply to making or taking calls , which are still prohibited in flight			1
phone calls are not allowed after the main cabin door is closed or before a crew member makes an announcement allowing calls upon arrival , @entity37 said			1
customers should not use their devices during safety announcements			0
for takeoff and landing , laptops and other electronic devices that weigh more than 2 pounds must be secured in an overhead bin or under the seat in front of passengers			0
some folks had a sense of humor about the device debate			0
earlier this month , @ @entity107 tweeted that " @entity109 policy too late for @entity110 , " referring to the 2011 incident in which the actor refused to turn off his electronic device at the gate and got booted from a flight .			0

@entity4 is newest airline to ease electronics rules
@entity28 , @entity29 , @entity35 , @entity37 have changed their policies
