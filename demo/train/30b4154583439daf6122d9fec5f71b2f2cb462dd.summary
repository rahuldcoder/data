-- skier @entity1 , a 49 - year - old manager from @entity2 , @entity3 , hardly matches the stereotype of a hostel dweller : an under - 30 backpacker from outside the @entity7 who ca n't afford fancy lodging			1
travelers looking to meet new people might consider staying at hostels , say experts			2
for the fifth time in two years , @entity14 plans to head to the @entity16 in @entity17 , @entity18 , where he 's booked a dorm - style room for less than $ 40 a night during his ski vacation			2
" if i 'm traveling by myself , there 's no reason to splurge , " said @entity1 , who is single and described himself as neither rich nor poor			2
" that $ 40 or $ 50 [ i save on lodging ] goes to food , beer and ski - lift tickets			0
" and amenities such as internet access and a hot tub at the hostel add creature comforts to the trip			0
@entity1 's travel habits are consistent with a growing number of travelers called " flashpackers			0
" they are usually over 30 , in mid-to - late career and can afford higher - end hotels but instead choose budget options -- albeit better - furnished and well - kept ones -- because it fits their lifestyle , said @entity47 , marketing director for @entity48 , a nonprofit network of hostels			1
@entity51 also tend to stay connected by traveling with gadgets and seeking accommodations with free @entity54 , @entity47 said			1
the term " flashpacker " likely originated in @entity56 , and combines the term " flash " -- meaning " stylish " -- with " backpacker , " according to @entity47			0
flashpackers and regular backpackers are booking hostels at @entity7 vacation destinations in full force this year			1
attendance at hostels has been consistently rebounding from lows following the september 11 , 2001			2
this year 's turbulent economy appears to be fueling demand for hostel space			0
heading into ski season , @entity71 , the owner of the @entity72 in @entity73 , @entity18 , said her hostel bookings are trending ahead of the town 's other lodging options -- and up about 25 percent from her bookings by the same time last year			0
amid the unsteady economy , she said , people " do n't want to give up a vacation , but they might need to adapt a vacation			0
" instead of canceling pricey vacations due to economic fears , many travelers are rejecting accommodations with private bedrooms and bathrooms			0
they 're going for hostels with their dorm - style bunk beds , community bathrooms , and , most importantly for many hostel dwellers , shared living spaces			1
" there 's a sense of community , and there 's a social aspect to it that 's pretty significant , " said @entity96 , editor of " the @entity97 " and a former hostel owner			1
" that is the heart of hostelling			1
you do n't go to a hotel and lock the door			0
" @entity1 agreed , saying that hostels offer " a tremendous way to meet people from different cultures and talk to people you would n't normally talk to			2
" but the communal atmosphere of hostels leaves many travelers skeptical , particularly @entity7 , @entity96 said			1
" @entity7 have privacy issues			1
if you suggested to most people they were going to share a room with five other people , most of them would n't want to do it , " he said			0
what if a roommate snores or what if he smells or does n't stop talking ? -- these are legitimate questions for travelers considering the hostel option , said @entity96			0
frequent hostel dweller @entity133 , 30 , said she enjoys the overall hostel experience , but it 's a " huge challenge " to " walk through the room and to my room without having to talk to 20 people			2
" @entity138 and her partner , @entity139 , 32 , who are documentary filmmakers from @entity141 , @entity142 , are bicycling around the @entity7 for a year and stopping in ecologically sustainable communities along the way			1
their choice to stay in hostels is rooted in a desire to maintain a green lifestyle by sharing resources as well as saving money			2
@entity139 experienced the other side of the privacy issue when he stepped out of a shower in a @entity155 , @entity142 , hostel to discover he had a female audience			1
" i ... did n't have my towel on -- and some girl walks in and was like , ' @entity159 ! ' i 'm totally open to that sort of thing , but i think she was a little bit new to it , and she kind of was giggling			0
but obviously the immediate reaction was , ' @entity164 ! ' " @entity139 said			0
in contrast to @entity7 who treasure their personal space , the communal environment is more ingrained in @entity170 culture , experts said			1
it 's possible to trace that cultural divide to @entity173 , said @entity96 , when @entity170 underwent its financial recovery in the 1950s and its culture was more communal			0
on the other hand , the @entity7 economy was booming , and there was no need for @entity7 to share resources			1
" at the same time [ @entity170 ] were creating hostels , @entity7 teenagers were focused on getting their own cars , " @entity96 said			1
nevertheless , @entity48 reported its hostels in many destination cities saw notable increases in october versus the same time last year : @entity190 overnight guests increased by 9.8 percent , @entity191 by 9.7 percent and @entity192 , @entity142 , by 22.1 percent , according to @entity48			1
despite the rise in many hostel bookings , @entity96 said hostelling still is n't part of mainstream @entity7 culture			1
" we do hostelling about as well as we do soccer			2
we do it , but it 's a limited market , and we do it a certain way			0
otherwise , most @entity7 are n't very comfortable [ with ] it , " @entity96 said			1
@entity1 said he believes this represents @entity7 ' " relatively conservative views and lifestyles			2
" but people are respectful of each other 's space , he said , and they rarely spend time together in the dorm room aside from sleeping anyway			0
" you just do your best ; everybody understands you are who are , " @entity1 said			0
" sometimes you get a guy who snores but ... that 's part of the deal			0

" @entity51 " are professionals older than 30 who prefer hostels to hotels
hostels in @entity190 , @entity191 and @entity192 , @entity142 , report increased guests
sense of community is the " heart of hostelling , " expert says
many @entity7 *uncomfortable* with hostels ' lack of privacy
