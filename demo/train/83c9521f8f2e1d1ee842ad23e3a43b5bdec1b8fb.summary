-- when i think of @entity2 , i think of @entity3 -- known to most as the @entity3 , or @entity3 -- the artist whose life was cut short 15 years ago on march 9			1
for others , @entity2 might call to mind the retro - cool style , hipness and youthful vibrancy that have become associated with the borough , an image that 's been aided by entertainment			2
yet whatever cultural shifts the borough sees through time , its relevancy does n't waver			2
while there , you can still feel the presence of @entity3 's lyrics : " ... spread love , it 's the @entity2 way			1
" i first met @entity3 at a @entity22 event at the @entity23 in june of 1994			1
it was for @entity26 employees to welcome our new joint venture with @entity29 " ( as he was known back then ) @entity31 and his @entity33 label			2
@entity34 introduced me to @entity3 as the guy who was going to get his records played on radio			1
his words were few , but his presence and stature were massive			2
a head nod , a handshake and an acknowledgment conveying it was " all good			2
" he was the epitome of @entity2 cool , but the world did n't know it yet			0
at the time , hip - hop was not getting played on mainstream radio -- my job was to get @entity3 there			1
over the next two years , i would travel the country , taking @entity3 to radio stations , lunches and promotional shows , introducing him to new audiences			1
crossing over into mainstream did n't apply to the then - 22 - year - old rapper in the way it does for many artists that do so today			0
artists who made hip - hop were not invited to awards shows , fashion shows or the @entity70 like they are now			0
in 1994 , @entity71 as a whole still seemed uneasy with the genre			0
but instead of conforming to appeal to the mainstream , @entity3 creatively figured out ways to be authentic			1
that authenticity , combined with his talent , brought mass appeal			0
and when he did breakthrough , subsequently opening doors for other rappers to benefit from his success , he never compromised that authenticity			0
he was always proud of his hometown of @entity2 , never forgetting where he came from as his success took him elsewhere			0
even if the mainstream did n't know it yet at the time , @entity2 for many years has been the breeding ground for many of today 's top lawyers , doctors , celebrities and athletes			0
@entity3 was proud of where he came from , showed it in his music and found success through his embrace of his roots			1
maybe the most poignant analogy that @entity3 made in his music was a reference that he 's the " rap @entity105			1
" as @entity116 points out in our annual @entity118 issue of the fader that was dedicated to the @entity3 ( @entity121 , april 2011 ) : " the boast may have been a simple comment on how @entity3 's rotund figure projected a silhouette similar to the filmmaker , but there 's a deeper spiritual bond between the two -- the detail obsession of full - blown perfectionists			1
" he goes on to highlight , " equally mind - blowing is how these skills came to be , borne practically from nothing			0
@entity3 entered the game as a fully formed rapper , with seemingly no blemishes on his track record			1
" it 's vital to point out that @entity3 ascended from @entity2 , and every experience in his life contributed to his outputs			1
much like @entity105 , @entity3 was able to express his thoughts with objective and subjective points of view seemingly without effort			1
he expressed his views on what he saw , from the perils of the streets to " eating @entity143 , with some [ women ] from @entity145 , eating clams or mussels [ from the track , ' my downfall ' ] "			0
creating an audio road map complete with visuals , he rhymed in intricate detail about everything from elaborate heists , to taking revenge on enemies , to bank accounts in @entity159 , all without letting go of the place that shaped him -- bringing it with him wherever he went			2
and the neighborhood loved him back			0
following @entity3 's death at 24 on march 9 , 1997 , the man who proclaimed he was " ready to die " was mourned in @entity2 as a funeral procession made its way through the streets of his youth			2
as i said in our @entity120 tribute to my friend , i 've often wondered what @entity3 would think of all the coverage he has gotten over the years			1
i think he 'd appreciate the cultural impact he has had			0
he 'd want @entity2 represented the right way , for his crew to be acknowledged and for the world to know that he was very aware , a stand - up guy , a jokester , a caring father and son , and extremely determined			0
with that in mind , we should celebrate his life -- and spread love the @entity2 way .			0

@entity193 : " i would travel the country , taking @entity3 to radio stations , lunches "
@entity193 : " @entity3 was able to express his thoughts with objective , subjective points of view "
