-- if you are reluctant to challenge your physician on a certain procedure or medicine , you are hardly alone			2
focus groups show that many patients feel intimidated by their doctors			1
they 're reluctant to take an active role in discussing their care because they 're afraid that the doctor will see them as " difficult			2
" recently , nine medical associations each took the unusual step of listing five medical procedures commonly used in their fields that patients do n't need , amounting to 45 tests or procedures			1
the associations report some of them might actually be harmful			1
eight medical associations have signed on to release additional lists in the fall			1
an annual @entity26 is an example of one test you can do without , unless family history or symptoms suggest otherwise			2
some procedures , such as repeated abdominal ct scans without a significant change in the patient 's condition , subject patients to a relatively high dose of radiation and can increase their cancer risk			1
it is not the government or the courts that issued these lists ; the physicians ' own professional associations decreed that these procedures usually should be avoided			1
but many doctors perform them anyway			1
there are many reasons for this : one is that doctors are often paid a fee for each procedure , and it does n't take much creativity to convince themselves the patient needs the intervention			1
another reason doctors i interviewed told me is that the medical associations ' recommendations have no legal standing			1
these doctors said they can be sued for not screening properly if their patient has a heart attack or some other untoward event			1
and sheer inertia is also a powerful factor in preventing reform ; the test is performed because " this is what we have been doing for years			2
" on these and on scores of other medical matters , you can not be a passive bystander			1
you need to keep an eye on what is ordered to be done to you and why			2
form your own judgments , disregard those doctors who pooh - pooh the @entity83			1
if you can find somewhere to park your general misgivings about the big , bad federal government , you will find that it runs excellent web pages where you can find very reliable information about what ails you , as well as information about possible treatments			2
for instance , the @entity92 and the @entity93 provide extensive resources			0
and if you can let go of the notion that the private sector is the best way to get what you need , you will find that nonprofit organizations provide very sound guidance , for instance , the @entity103 and the @entity104			0
it 's true there are dubious medical sites on the @entity83 , and you do best by following the same guidelines that serve well in the financial world : if something sounds too good to be true , it probably is			2
if anybody tells you that you can lose 30 pounds easily if you buy their junk , let alone cure your cancer with apricot pits and coffee enemas in a few easy visits , click off and move on			0
behavioral economics has shown that people are more swayed by anecdotes than by statistics			0
parents will think the risks of vaccination are much higher after reading testimonials from parents whose children had negative reactions , in spite of having seen statistical information that says the risks are low			0
you need to pay more attention to people who say it with figures			0
when i read in the @entity138 that a procedure i was to undergo had a 10 % risk of " esophageal injury with ulceration , " i forced myself to pay more attention to this statistic than to the tale of a friend who had the same procedure and did well			0
i am sorry to say that i know quite a few people who agreed to undergo major surgery upon their doctor 's recommendation without investigating their options			0
some of those surgeries went awfully wrong			0
but they would not dream of buying a lawn mower , let alone a car , in this way			0
if you keep in mind what can and often does go wrong , you are likely to find the inner strength to ask questions , even if you have to apologize for not saluting the doctor and doing what you are told			0
and if you have to pay from your pocket for a second opinion , it 's worth it			0
i have been an inquisitive patient , which is one reason i am hitting 83			0
i refused to undergo more surgeries than i have and , politely , left some doctors who were too eager to conduct a lot of tests that seemed to me hard to justify			1
i am not saying it is easy ; just that it is vital			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity177 .			1

nine medical associations each listed common medical procedures you do n't need
@entity177 : patients too intimidated to question doctors about procedures
@entity177 : doctors order tests anyway ; for money , out of habit or fear of lawsuits
beware of doctors dismissing your *research* , he says . stand up and demand answers
