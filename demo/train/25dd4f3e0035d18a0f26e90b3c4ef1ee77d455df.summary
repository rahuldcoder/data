a river of blood runs through @entity3 , as homes are smashed to rubble and hospital emergency rooms overflow			1
the volley of @entity9 rockets into @entity10 continues , even when met with the preeminent firepower of the @entity10 military 's bombs , missiles and shells			1
the legions of dead are swelling by the hundreds			2
but the world has seen it all before -- twice			2
@entity22 looks much like its forerunners in 2008 and 2012			2
@entity9 wo n't back down			1
and @entity10 refuses to stop until it feels the job is done			1
millions around the world watch and ask : what could @entity10 hope to achieve ? @entity2 put that question and others to two seasoned @entity10 columnists : one a former military correspondent , the other a human rights journalist focusing on @entity32			1
though they disagreed on many points , they surprisingly concurred on some others			2
this is how they answered : 1			2
what is @entity10 's endgame in this operation ? there is none			1
both experts agree on that			2
but though @entity10 may not be working toward one dramatic outcome , there are concrete objectives , says military writer @entity47			1
there are short - term and long - term goals that are worth it for @entity10 , he argues			1
many of them will work , concedes critical columnist @entity53			2
but he disagrees about their wisdom			0
they wo n't cure the disease but instead feed it , he argues			0
it will turn the violence into a recurring nightmare			2
what is the immediate military objective ? the conservative government led by prime minister @entity63 wants to stop the @entity9 rocket fire			2
the mission will also weaken @entity9 , @entity47 says			0
" @entity68 the political clout and the ability of @entity9 to act both as a political and military - terrorist movement , " those are the objectives , he says			2
in the meantime that mission has expanded to destroying underground tunnels , which @entity9 militants use to get into @entity10 and attack			1
@entity47 is confident the goals can be achieved			0
" for the short - run , no doubt , " @entity53 concurs			0
but he thinks @entity9 will come back stronger after @entity22 , both militarily and politically			2
he cites @entity80 in 2012 and @entity81 in 2008			0
in @entity81 , 1,300 @entity32 and more than a dozen @entity10 died			1
afterward , @entity9 made a full recovery , he said			0
what sparked this round of conflict ? @entity53 sees the rocket fire from @entity3 as the boiling over of cumulative tensions			1
he points to the peace process initiated by @entity90 secretary of state @entity89 between @entity10 and @entity32			1
the one that broke down weeks ago			0
the whole time , someone was missing from the negotiating table , he said			0
" @entity3 was ignored totally			1
" youth killings , of three @entity10 teens and then one @entity32 teen , ignited passions on both sides			1
add to that the desperation in @entity3			1
the narrow strip of land is locked in on all sides , and people there live in dire poverty and deprivation			0
" @entity3 is today the biggest cage in the world , " @entity53 says			1
the rocket fire is just a part of it all , he says			0
it 's a way of @entity9 pounding the table			0
@entity47 sees it the other way around			0
@entity10 has tried peace and calm with the troublesome @entity9 militants , and it has n't worked out			1
" this formula is out of the game			0
it 's not in the cards now , " he says			0
the military option has become inevitable			2
what makes @entity22 different ? @entity47 agrees with @entity53 's assessment that @entity9 militants have come back stronger since the last military operation -- in at least one sense			1
they have more long - range rockets			0
previously , militants had to import them all from the outside			0
now they can also construct them themselves , he says			0
they 've also buried a network of launch sites below the ground 's surface			0
hitting them " is quite a job , " @entity47 says			0
the @entity10 military will have to strike deep into those systems			1
@entity53 says the improvement in weaponry is part of the vicious cycle he 's seen before			0
the @entity10 military destroys the militants ' capabilities ; they come back stronger			1
" by the next operation , they will be even better equipped , " he says			2
@entity9 has also inflicted more casualties on @entity10 this time around -- 29 soldiers have died in the @entity3 ground incursion , whereas just over a dozen died in @entity81			1
if too many @entity10 die , it could have an effect on @entity10 public opinion and perhaps turn things around , @entity53 says			1
but so far , the public is showing much support for the operation in @entity3			1
what will be the lasting effects of the operation ? the government hopes that @entity22 will give @entity10 a few years of relative peace and restore normalcy for a time , @entity47 says			1
" after every round of hostility ... there is a sort of lull that @entity10 enjoys very much , " he says			1
people can think about other things and tackle other issues , like the economy			0
but it 's not nearly worth the cost , @entity53 says			0
@entity183 of @entity32 will be killed , others ' lives ruined			0
even from a purely selfish standpoint , it 's at best an empty victory			0
" we will see horrible scenes , " he says			0
" the world will condemn @entity10			1
and what comes out of it ? one year of peace			0
" @entity47 believes there is a permanent gain to be made , that repeated operations in @entity3 will wear the enemy down until they stop firing rockets altogether			1
the result will be the opposite , @entity53 says			0
he predicts that this military intervention will set the stage for the next bloodcurdling intervention -- and then the next			2
what is @entity9 ' endgame in @entity3 ? new wave of @entity10 airstrikes hammers @entity3 flare - up in @entity10 - @entity32 violence : why now ? has the @entity212 crisis reached a tipping point ?			1

military operations in @entity3 make sense for @entity10 , an *analyst* says
they will only make the violence *fester* and come back strong , says another
both agree : for @entity10 there is no dramatic endgame in this operation
