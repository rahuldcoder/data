-- interior secretary @entity1 on wednesday approved the nation 's first offshore wind farm , signing off on a project that has bitterly divided @entity5 over the last nine years			1
the 130 turbines are to be located several miles from the @entity8 shore in the iconic waters of @entity10			1
the interior secretary said @entity11 , as the project is known , is the start of a " new energy frontier			1
" " the @entity17 is leading a clean energy revolution that is reshaping our future , " @entity1 told reporters in @entity16			2
" @entity11 is an opening of a new chapter in that future , and we are all part of that history			0
" " @entity11 will be the nation 's first offshore wind farm , supplying clean power to homes and businesses in @entity8 , plus creating good jobs here in @entity17 , " he said			1
" this will be the first of many projects up and down the @entity35 coast			0
" " thank you for this decision , " said gov. @entity36			0
" with this project , @entity8 will lead the nation			2
this day has been a long time coming			0
" the location of the wind farm has stirred heated emotions over the years			1
@entity11 became one of the most heavily vetted energy projects in the world			2
seventeen state and federal agencies weighed in , reviewing everything from its impact on shipping , aviation and fisheries			0
@entity1 visited the @entity5 earlier this year			1
at the time , he pledged to cut through the nine years of regulatory red tape and make a final decision by the end of april			2
at wednesday 's news conference , the interior secretary said the process took far too long and future offshore projects would follow a " more rational and orderly " process			1
there is no reason , he said , " why an offshore wind permit should take a decade to review and approve			1
" the most notable opponent of @entity11 was the late sen. @entity67 , a champion of green energy who , to the dismay of environmentalists , fought against the wind farm			1
the @entity67 compound will have a view of the wind turbines			1
see how the views on the @entity5 will change other opponents ranged from billionaire energy giant @entity78 to former @entity8 gov. @entity80			2
@entity17 @entity81 in the region also objected , saying the wind farm would be located on sacred ancestral grounds and disturb important sunrise ceremonies			1
" i am strongly opposed to the administration 's misguided decision to move forward with @entity11 , " sen. @entity86 said wednesday			0
" while i support the concept of wind power as an alternative source of energy , @entity10 is a national treasure that should be protected from industrialization			1
" in announcing his decision , @entity1 said @entity11 must follow stringent measures during construction , and it must conduct additional marine and archeological assessments of its impact			2
the company must also explore ways to make the wind turbines less visible from shore			1
" the smart responsible development of wind potential on @entity106 need not conflict with the history and tradition of @entity10 , " @entity1 said			1
@entity110 , the @entity111 and nearly every major environmental group in the nation supported the project , saying it 's necessary in moving the nation forward			2
six governors in the region also backed @entity11			0
" even though we enjoy overwhelming majority support , it 's not a popularity contest , " @entity11 ceo @entity118 told @entity0			0
" this decision needs to be made on the merits			0
and the record shows that it is in the public interest			0
" in an editorial today , the @entity128 said simply : " make clean energy a reality ; approve @entity11 now			0
" the @entity132 earlier this week also endorsed the project			0
" offshore wind farms are a common sight in @entity136 but not here , " the @entity132 wrote			2
" @entity11 would be this country 's first -- sending , finally , a signal to the world about @entity17 's resolve to fight global warming and reduce its dependence on foreign oil			0
" the wind farm would bring hundreds of jobs and provide up to 75 percent of the power needed by the @entity5 and islands of @entity148 and @entity10 , according to @entity11			1
estimates of the project have ranged from $ 800 million to $ 1 billion ; @entity11 has not released how much it believes the wind farm will cost			2
see the location of the wind farm the 130 turbines , spaced a third - to a half - mile apart , will cover about 25 of the 500 square miles of @entity10			1
they will stand more than 40 stories tall , well over 10 times bigger than nearly every other structure around the @entity5			2
@entity11 has said the project will not necessarily bring cheaper energy , but will bring cleaner electricity and become a model for offshore wind energy			1
the @entity163 , the project 's chief nemesis , has vowed to file suit to continue to try to block it			0
the project already has withstood multiple court challenges			0
@entity170 , a member of the @entity171 , harshly criticized the decision to go ahead with the project			0
" this is a federal embarrassment and a slap in the face not only to the tribes ... but it 's also a slap in the face to the people who make their living " off fishing in the area of the wind farm 's location , @entity170 said			1
@entity186 has long supported @entity11 as the executive director of the grassroots organization @entity188			0
" we 're going to be partying later on tonight , " she said			0
" we applaud @entity190 for his vision and leadership in making this landmark decision and look forward to the day when the wind farm in @entity10 will be producing the majority of the electrical needs of the @entity5 and islands			1
" wind farms produce roughly 2 percent of the nation 's energy , all from land - based facilities in @entity202 , @entity203 , @entity204 , @entity205 and a few other states			1
locations offshore are considered optimal because the winds are stronger and more consistent			0
a 2008 @entity211 report calls for " 20 percent @entity212 by 2030			0
" it said 18 percent of the nation 's wind energy should come from offshore sites			1
@entity11 first sought a permit in fall 2001			0
during that time , @entity218 built its first offshore wind farm			1
nine other countries have offshore farms : @entity222 , @entity223 , @entity224 , @entity225 , @entity226 , the @entity227 , @entity228 , @entity229 and the @entity230			0
on wednesday , gov. @entity36 said @entity11 will now allow the @entity17 to join the offshore wind race			2
" @entity17 now has a chance to turn that around			0
