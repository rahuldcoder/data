-- she started her business with just Â £ 100 , lugging her beauty bag from door to door , but some 25 years later @entity5 has built a multi-million dollar cosmetics empire that 's helping change the perception of beauty for many			1
one of @entity11 's top entrepreneurs , @entity9 has turned her mobile therapist venture into the @entity13 of companies -- a thriving conglomerate that includes clinics , a versatile cosmetics line and a beauty school			1
@entity9 says her mission has always been to restore and enhance the natural beauty of black women -- a passion of hers ever since she was a child visiting her mother 's salon			1
" seeing how beautiful the women looked after their hairstyles and makeup really touched me and i decided that i would like to continue with this professionally , " explains @entity9 , who went to college in the @entity26 and studied beauty therapy			1
upon returning to the @entity32 country , she initially started working from door to door as a mobile therapist but quickly managed to amass a large number of clients and decided to open her first beauty clinic			2
' a concept of well - being ' at the beginning , @entity9 says , one of the main things she had to combat when she put her business plan into action was the practice of skin lightening , or skin bleaching as it 's often called , which refers to the use of chemical products in an attempt to lighten skin tone			1
" [ women ] associated being light - skinned with being affluent or something and i thought that i can do something about that by going on an anti-bleaching campaign , " says @entity9			1
" we went to the markets with our vans and spoke about the dangers of bleaching , especially in this climate			1
when you remove the protective layer of the skin , you expose all of yourself to the sun 's rays and eventually [ can ] develop skin cancer			1
" the practice of using creams and other cosmetic products to chemically lighten skin tone is a fairly common in many @entity32 countries -- but the practice is known to have detrimental health effects , says the @entity75			1
" i discovered that women were actually formulating their own concoctions at home using perming creams and all kinds of chemicals to bleach [ their skin ] , " @entity9 reveals			1
" bleaching is a very dangerous enterprise to embark on and we try as much as we can to educate the public on it , " she says			1
" beauty is a total concept , it 's a concept of well - being -- if you eat well , exercise well and rest well , your skin will naturally glow			1
" nurturing talent in her battle against bleaching , the determined beautician has launched an education initiative			2
in addition to a weekly newspaper column , where she offers advice to people about keeping their skin healthy , she also combats the prevalence of chemical options by training students at her beauty school and when selling products over the counter			2
" setting up the school was a matter of course , because i needed help , so i started with two students and trained them for free so they can give me assistance , " says the business mogul			2
since then @entity9 says over 5,000 students have graduated from @entity121			2
" on the day of graduation , i always cry because i see the joy in their faces that they have accomplished something , " she says			0
" they 've been through challenges			0
" it 's this desire to nurture young talent and help women embrace their natural beauty that seems to drive the successful entrepreneur 's efforts			2
while she admits that she ca n't help every young woman who passes through the college doors , she always reminds students of her startup experience to inspire them			0
" i tell them my story all the time , " says @entity9			0
" take products and go door to door ; communicate with your clients ; express your knowledge and you will win their confidence , " she adds			0
" so we give them different options and entrepreneur skills so they can be able to stand on their own			0
" despite a lifetime of industry experience and successful business , @entity9 says it 's still the small things -- like seeing a satisfied client -- that makes her smile			0
" i see clients come in with horrible conditions and through therapy and guidance , they are happy			0
and once they 're happy , i 'm happy , " she says			0
" once you are able to restore joy to people , it 's very , very fulfilling			0
it 's good to reach out to the deprived and to me that is fulfillment			0
