-- it has been a bittersweet month for @entity3 sport			1
@entity5 's bid to become the nation 's first @entity7 men 's singles champion since 1936 was derailed , while the @entity10 football team suffered penalty - shootout heartache at the recent @entity13 tournament			2
but across the channel there is one @entity16 at the forefront of his sport who , through a series of peerless performances , is in line to become the @entity3 's first @entity24 winner			1
@entity25 , with his mutton - chop sideburns and slim physique , does not instantly come across as an elite athlete			1
but the @entity30 rider is dominating the @entity31 , picking up the first stage win of his career between @entity34 and @entity35 with an astonishing display of power to open up a lead of one minute , 53 seconds over second - placed defending champion @entity39			0
@entity41 @entity24 rider arrested " it is @entity25 ' @entity24 to lose , " according to former @entity3 cyclist and now commentator @entity44 , who made his debut in the race in 1978			1
" he could have been on the podium last year and he crashed out on stage seven			0
this year he got the yellow jersey on stage seven			0
" @entity51 finished the 2009 race in fourth position , equaling the best finish by a @entity3 rider -- first achieved by @entity57 's @entity56 in 1984			1
his preparation for the 99th edition of the @entity24 has been both impressive and meticulous , and has left nothing to chance			1
the globalization of the @entity24 earlier this year , the @entity64 - born rider became the first man to win the @entity67 , @entity68 and @entity69 stage races in the same season , while also embarking on a number of high - altitude training camps to prepare his body stands for the rigors of the @entity41 cols in the @entity76 and the @entity77			2
" there 's a long way to go , " @entity44 told @entity0 ahead of thursday 's 10th stage			0
" we 've seen 20 riders leave the tour through injury , i have never seen that before			0
" hopefully all the bad luck and bad crashes are behind the @entity24 , and hopefully @entity25 wo n't have any			1
" judge tosses @entity89 suit against anti-doping agency if @entity51 wanted an example of just how quickly a challenge in the prestigious race can unravel , he need look no further than the first @entity16 to wear the " maillot jaune , " @entity91			2
the charismatic @entity96 , who raced for @entity97 and could on occasion be seen carrying a cane umbrella when he was n't on a bike , was sixth after the first week of the 1967 race but a stomach bug hindered his challenge			0
@entity96 , the victim of heat exhaustion and amphetamines taken to enhance performance , died on the slopes of @entity109 in southern @entity41 , during the 12th stage of the 1967 race			0
half a century later @entity3 cycling is in a very different place , with its riders no longer having to go abroad in search of a professional racing career			2
and the team that @entity51 cycles for -- the @entity30 team -- is now the dominant force at the @entity24 , having been established in the wake of @entity122 's success at the @entity123			2
@entity30 's lineup includes the sport 's top sprinter @entity125 as well as @entity51 ' heir apparent @entity127 , who is third on the @entity24			2
gold medals from @entity51 in the 4km individual pursuit and the team pursuit on the track in @entity132 propelled @entity3 to the top of the cycling medal table four years ago			2
@entity3 cycling performance director @entity135 formed the country 's first professional team in 2009 and @entity30 made its @entity24 debut in 2010			1
" up until recently , we had to expatriate ourselves to race professionally , " explained @entity44			0
" live on our own , survive on our own and ride as part of a @entity41 , @entity143 or @entity64 team			0
" nowadays , the @entity144 have professional teams , we 've now a got a @entity3 team on the international circuit and the @entity148 have got their own professional team			1
" it gives youngsters something more to aim at			0
i 'm not saying it 's easier , but , in @entity10 soccer , you 've got @entity157 , @entity158 and @entity159 and you can dream of playing for one of those teams as a kid			0
" now kids riding their bikes in @entity10 can dream of getting into a professional team and getting into the @entity24			0
it 's an attainable dream			0
" @entity135 's plan was to produce a @entity24 winner within five years , though			1
@entity51 could be set to deliver ahead of schedule			0
" the perception of @entity30 is very good , " said @entity44			0
" they are already comparing it to @entity89 's @entity173 ( with which he won five of his seven @entity24 wins between 1999 and 2004			1
) " @entity30 made mistakes originally , but they have learned from those mistakes and corrected them			0
" after the culmination of the tour on @entity182 ' @entity181 on july 22 , @entity51 will turn his attention to a home @entity184 in @entity186 where he will compete in the time trial event			1
a historic win in @entity41 could provide @entity51 , @entity3 cycling and the nation 's sports fans with a timely boost ahead of @entity186 's third @entity184			1
" if @entity25 could win the @entity24 this year it would be absolutely huge , " said @entity44			1
" if he could win the @entity24 in an @entity184 year , with the @entity184 being in @entity186 , it would double or even treble cycling 's exposure			1

the @entity24 is an annual cycling race which was first held in 1903
the 99th edition of the race began on june 30 and will finish on july 22
@entity144 cyclist @entity89 won the race seven times between 1995 - 2005
@entity25 is the *current* leader and looking to become @entity3 's first winner
