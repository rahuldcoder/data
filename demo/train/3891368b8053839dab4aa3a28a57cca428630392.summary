-- @entity2 's @entity1 listed the wrong date in the @entity5 version of voter registration cards , a development likely to further complicate tense relations between local authorities and @entity11 residents			1
the county 's elections office says it mailed out nearly 2 million new voter registration cards			1
only about 50 of the cards -- handed out over-the - counter at its offices -- had the error , it said			1
instead of november 6 , the @entity5 translation said the election would take place on november 8			0
" the program has been updated so it reflects the correct dates in both @entity27 and @entity5 , " the county said in a statement			1
a local rights group said the damage has already been done			1
" it 's a mistake that should not have happened , " @entity30 , the executive director of @entity2 in @entity31 , told @entity0 affiliate @entity32			1
" to know that there 's information out there that 's wrong , it 's going to take a lot of work to make sure that people know the correct date			0
" @entity42 describes itself as " a nonprofit organization dedicated to expanding civic participation in @entity2 , particularly among @entity45 and youth			0
" county officials and local hispanics have long had an adversarial relationship , particularly over the subject of illegal immigration			1
those disputes have landed in court			0
in one instance , the @entity54 of @entity2 and other attorneys are representing hispanics in a class - action lawsuit accusing @entity1 sheriff @entity59 of civil rights and constitutional violations			1
the bench trial is being held in the @entity63 in @entity64			0
plaintiffs in the civil case accuse @entity59 -- who bills himself as " @entity68 's toughest " -- and his department of racial discrimination against @entity45			1
the @entity71 , and the @entity54 of @entity2 , are waiting for a federal judge 's ruling after a trial of their class - action lawsuit			2
in a separate matter , the @entity77 has also accused the sheriff 's office of civil rights violations against @entity45			2
the sheriff has described the lawsuit against him and the county as politically motivated			2
" they 're using me for the @entity11 vote , showing that they 're doing something , taking on the sheriff over an alleged racial profiling , " he said in may			1
@entity59 rejected the @entity77 's call for monitors to oversee the workings of his department			0
" that shows you they want to take over this office , " he said			0
" under this agreement with the so - called monitor , i 'd probably have to clear every press release before i go public , especially having to do with illegal immigration , with the @entity77			2
" his remarks came after the @entity77 filed the civil lawsuit			0
" at its core , this is an abuse - of - power case involving a sheriff and sheriff 's office that disregarded the @entity111 , ignored sound police practices , compromised public safety and did not hesitate to retaliate against perceived critics , " assistant u.s. attorney general @entity105 said in may			2
the @entity77 had delivered in december a report with findings of civil rights violations and sought to fix them through a negotiated settlement with @entity1 and its sheriff 's office			1
those talks broke down in february over the county 's refusal to consider any agreement that involved an independent monitor , @entity105 said			0
according to the civil complaint , the sheriff 's office has displayed a pattern of discrimination against @entity45 , which includes racial profiling , unlawful detention and searches , and unlawful targeting of @entity45 during raids			0
@entity59 has denied any discrimination , and one of his attorneys called the @entity77 investigation a " witch hunt			0
" @entity0 's @entity141 contributed to this report			0

about 50 of the incorrect cards were handed out , @entity1 says
the mistake has been corrected , according to county officials
there is a long - running *controversy* between local authorities and @entity11 residents
hispanic groups have accused county officials of discrimination
