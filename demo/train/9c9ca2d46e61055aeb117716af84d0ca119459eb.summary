editor 's note : @entity2 , who was political director for president @entity3 , is a @entity4 strategist who was national chairman of former @entity7 gov. @entity6 's 2008 presidential campaign			1
@entity8 , seen in a 2006 photo , was an actor with a strong interest in justice and peace , @entity2 says			1
@entity13 ( @entity14 ) -- the lights on @entity16 were dimmed wednesday night to honor @entity8 , the @entity17 winning actor who was buried wednesday after a courageous battle against cancer of the esophagus			1
@entity8 was a lifelong social liberal and a @entity23 activist , but you could n't narrowly define him			1
and to those of us privileged to be his friend , he was an extraordinary pal			2
in the 25 years we were friends , he and i faced off most of that time on opposite sides of the political spectrum			2
in this era when people want bipartisanship , @entity8 was the role model			1
our earliest encounters began when i was managing @entity3 's campaign and he was a @entity38 supporter			2
he was passionate and a true intellectual			2
i have spent much of my life around smart people ( fortunately a lot smarter than @entity43 ) and @entity8 was one of the smartest			1
whatever the topic , he had an opinion on it and probably had just read a book or two on the subject			2
@entity8 was a @entity50 and international relations scholar and had no casual thoughts , only deep convictions			1
he backed up his opinions with empirical evidence and could rattle off facts like a baseball statistician			0
" @entity58 , why do you think that way ? " ( only my mother and wife have called me @entity58			0
) " why would a smart man like you ever come to that conclusion ? " and then we would proceed to discuss the topic for hours			0
i do n't think we ever changed each other 's opinions , but after a bottle or two of wine or a bottle of @entity72 had been emptied , we still respected each other			2
we never had a cross word and no discussion ever ended in anger			0
after a while i learned it was n't personal and it was n't because i was @entity4			0
@entity8 argued with everyone -- even those on his side in an issue -- because he had great curiosity and always wanted to know more			1
the closest we ever came to harsh words was when i teased him on his @entity87 nomination for a recurring role as a slick campaign strategist on the tv show " @entity90			0
" " you would have won if you asked me how to play the part , " i declared			0
" after all you 're just an actor			0
i am the real thing			0
i worked in the real @entity90 and i managed a real campaign that won 49 states , " he quickly replied with a big grin : " why the hell would i want the input of a guy who lost @entity100 [ the only state @entity3 lost ] ? and remember , you only won because you had an actor named @entity8 making you look good ! " our discussions often ended in laughter			1
because for @entity8 , politics was serious but it was also fun			1
i do n't think he enjoyed anything more than a great political debate			0
to @entity8 , debate was an educational experience			1
to those of us on the opposite side it was like a combat sport			0
several years ago , i was approached by one of the planners for the @entity120 in @entity13			0
he wanted to know if i could recommend any movie or entertainment stars who would be willing to participate in the convention			0
since the passing of the @entity3 era , republicans have n't had a long list of entertainers to choose from			0
from our discussions , i knew that @entity8 supported president @entity133 's battle against @entity135 terrorism and the war in @entity137 and he had been profoundly affected by 9/11			1
i asked him would he be willing to participate if asked			0
he said yes , but emphatically stated he was remaining a @entity138			1
but he also knew that when he publicly supported @entity133 on the war , it would affect his long relationships in @entity142 and could cost him future work			1
@entity8 's monday night convention speech was short , less than five minutes and only 429 words in length			1
it was n't covered by any of the major networks , but it was still one of the best of the night			0
when he stated : " i am grateful for the chance to speak tonight to express my support for our commander - in - chief , for our brave troops and for the vital cause which they have undertaken , " his career as a major @entity142 player was over			1
even though he had been a president of both the @entity160 and the @entity161 that he co-founded , he challenged the entertainment industry with these spoken words : " even though i am a well - recognized liberal on many issues confronting our society today , i find it ironic that many human rights advocates and outspoken members of my own entertainment community are often on the front lines to protest repression , for which i applaud them , but they are usually the first ones to oppose any use of force to take care of these horrors that they catalog repeatedly			0
" @entity8 was disappointed when he did lose future work and even a few " so - called @entity142 friends , " but not surprised			1
but he said what he believed and never regretted doing it			0
@entity8 was always determined to give back something to his country and @entity13 , the city where he , his parents , grandparents and great grandparents were born and loved			1
whether he was fighting for the cause of @entity189 or social justice for the poor or for more funding for the @entity192 or aids research , he was passionate about his causes			2
even though he was close to death , he attended president @entity197 's inauguration because he thought it was a great day for the country and he did n't want to miss it			2
and just a few weeks ago while still undergoing chemotherapy , @entity8 attended the latest board of directors meeting in @entity203 of the @entity204			1
the @entity205 is an independent , nonpartisan institution established and funded by @entity206 whose 12 members are appointed by the president			0
the organizational goals are to help prevent and resolve violent international conflicts			0
@entity8 was appointed in 2007 and was confirmed by the @entity212 for a four - year term			1
he told me it was his most important role and a part he was never prouder to play			0
as the dimming of the lights on @entity16 signaled wednesday night , @entity8 's voice is now quiet -- and missed			1
his life 's work not only lit up @entity16 and filled the big screen , it also inspired others to action			1
the many roles he played on the stage , in movies and on television pale in comparisons to the real roles he lived in his life			2
@entity8 was a great friend , a great father and a great @entity234			2
we will miss you , my friend			0
