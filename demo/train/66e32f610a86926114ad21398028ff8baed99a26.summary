global warming has propelled @entity2 's climate from one of its coldest decades since the last ice age to one of its hottest -- in just one century			1
a heat spike like this has never happened before , at least not in the last 11,300 years , said climatologist @entity8 , who worked on a new study on global temperatures going back that far			1
" if any period in time had a sustained temperature change similar to what we have today , we would have certainly seen that in our record , " he said			2
it is a good indicator of just how fast man - made climate change has progressed			1
a century is a very short period of time for such a spike			0
it 's supposed to be cold the @entity2 was very cold at the turn of the 20th century			1
the decade from 1900 to 1909 was colder than 95 % of the last 11,300 years , the study found			1
fast forward to the turn of the 21st century , and the opposite occurs			0
between 2000 and 2009 , it was hotter than about 75 % of the last 11,300 years			1
if not for man - made influences , the @entity2 would be in a very cold phase right now and getting even colder , according the joint study by @entity31 and @entity32			1
@entity8 was the lead author of the report on its results			0
to boot , the range of temperatures from cold to hot produced since the industrial revolution began are about the same as the 11,000 years before it , said @entity40 from the @entity41 , " but this change has happened a lot more quickly			1
" far from natural warming variations in how the @entity2 is tilted and its orbit around the sun make for a pattern of planetary warming phases followed by cooling phases across the millennia			1
the team 's research shows the @entity2 's overall temperature curve dipping down over about the past 4,000 years , but the downward plod comes to an abrupt halt in modern times			1
" if you were to predict -- based on where we are relative to the position of the sun and how we are tilted -- you would predict that we would be still cooling , but we 're not , " @entity8 said			0
instead , the planet is warming up			2
it has n't been quite this warm in thousands of years			2
and it 's getting hotter			2
by 2100 , the @entity2 will be warmer than ever before , @entity8 said			1
if emissions continue as currently predicted until then , global temperatures will rise " well above anything we 've ever seen in the last 11,000 years			1
" that could be a rise of 2 to 11.5 degrees @entity73 , according to the @entity41			2
what a long range study means to get a view on global temperatures that long ago , the researchers studied 73 sediment and polar ice samples , taken from all over the globe			0
chemicals found in fossils deep down in the samples span the ages and are good indicators of historic temperatures on @entity2 , @entity8 said			2
the scientists did the study to put the global temperature trends into a long - range perspective , @entity8 said			1
critics of climate change research , which has generally covered the last 1,500 to 2,000 years , have complained that it has been too short - sighted			2
they argue that the shorter studies have not taken into account that the warming @entity2 is seeing today could have happened before naturally -- thousands of years ago			1
these shorter studies have been based on methods that are very different from the @entity32 - @entity31 research , but in the 2,000 years that they overlap , the results have been basically the same			2
" our data shows that ... they did n't miss anything , " @entity8 said			0
and the parallel results corroborate the precision of the new research as well , he said			0
humanity in the last 11,500 years the scientists chose the period of time known as the " holocene " for their research , because it is the most recent natural warm phase in @entity2 's history			1
it began at the end of the last @entity117 about 11,500 years ago , and we are still in it			0
the @entity120 has also been the epoch of human achievement , the beginning of civilization			0
stable weather patterns helped people do more of everything they wanted to , partly because they no longer had to fight the cold of an ice age			0
they began farming , which extended their own life spans and increased population on @entity2			2
they built cities and roads , made art , developed languages and laws			0
they formed empires and nations			0
eventually , they invented machines , landing themselves in the industrialized age , driven by engines and turbines , which are powered by combustible fuel			0
thus began man - made greenhouse gases			1
the world tomorrow the main culprit is carbon dioxide , and its levels have jumped in the last 100 years , @entity8 said			0
in the 11,000 years prior , it only changed " very slowly , " he said			0
@entity8 is concerned about people 's ability to adapt to a perhaps drastically changed climate			0
" as civilization has grown , we 're kind of set up for things not to change too much , " he said			0
the last time @entity2 has been as warm as it is projected to be by 2100 was before the last @entity117 started -- over 130,000 years ago			1
that 's too long ago to gather reliable data on , he said			0
he did n't want to speculate on what the world will look like , if global warming continues			1
" i certainly hope we can pull ourselves out of it , " he said .			0

if greenhouse gas emissions progress , @entity2 will become hotter than ever in 90 years
the temperature rise during man - made global warming has not happened before
1900 - 1909 was one of the coldest decades in 11,300 years
2000 - 2009 was one of the hottest decades in 11,300 years
