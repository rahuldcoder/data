the @entity1 investigation was hijacked " in a number of ways " by outside forces , said the former police chief of @entity6 , @entity7			1
@entity8 , who testified monday in @entity1 's second - degree murder trial , told @entity11 's @entity10 in an exclusive interview that he felt pressure from city officials to arrest @entity1 to placate the public rather than as a matter of justice			1
" it was ( relayed ) to me that they just wanted an arrest			0
they did n't care if it got dismissed later , " he said			0
" you do n't do that			0
" when @entity6 police arrived on the scene on february 26 , 2012 , after @entity1 fatally shot unarmed 17 - year - old @entity28 , they conducted a " sound " investigation , and the evidence provided no probable cause to arrest @entity1 at the scene , he said			1
it had nothing to do with @entity7 's controversial " @entity37 " law , he said ; from an investigative standpoint , it was purely a matter of self - defense			0
@entity1 told police he killed @entity28 after the teen attacked him			1
while the evidence at the time corroborated that claim , the ex-chief said , @entity8 's lead investigator made a recommendation that @entity1 be charged with manslaughter			1
justice @entity49 ' peacekeepers ' worked ' @entity28 ' rallies , group claims it was a matter of protocol , @entity8 said			1
arresting @entity1 based on the evidence at hand would have been a violation of @entity1 's @entity59 rights , he said			1
thus , the @entity6 police presented a " capias request " to the state 's attorney , asking that the prosecutor determine whether it was a " justifiable homicide , " issue a warrant for arrest or present the case to a grand jury			1
" the police department needed to do a job , and there was some influence -- outside influence and inside influence -- that forced a change in the course of the normal criminal justice process , " @entity8 said			2
" with all the influence and the protests and petitions for an arrest , you still have to uphold your oath			0
" " that investigation was taken away from us			0
we were n't able to complete it , " he said			0
one example involved the 911 tapes , in which neighbors implored dispatchers to send police as a voice in the background screamed for help			1
the @entity6 police intended to release the tapes once the probe was over , @entity8 said , because you ca n't publicize evidence amid an investigation			1
instead , the mayor told him on march 16 the tapes had been released to @entity28 's family and the public			1
the family was asked to help identify voices , @entity8 said , but if police were in charge of the investigation , they would n't have presented evidence to a group			1
" it should be done individually so there 's no influence on the other people in the room , " he said			0
" then , there 's no questions that can be brought up about how ( an identification ) was obtained or whether it was influenced			0
" releasing the evidence to the public was problematic , as well , because it created the potential for someone to concoct a " story about what they observed when they really did n't observe it , " he said			2
@entity28 family attorney @entity131 said she does n't believe playing the tapes to a room full of people " makes any difference to the outcome of the case			1
" " we have to remember that that was played for the family in a private room because they were hearing the last moments of their son 's life as he cried for help , " @entity138 told @entity11 's @entity139 on wednesday night			1
" and i think @entity148 ( @entity28 's mother ) got up and walked out of that room			1
she did n't sit in there and talk to everybody , because she had a visceral reaction when she heard her son yell for help and she could n't help him because she knew he was dead			0
" @entity8 was placed on paid leave march 22 , 2012 , after the @entity156 expressed a lack of confidence in him			2
the same commission rejected his resignation in a 3 - 2 vote a month later , with dissenting commissioners questioning the fairness of @entity8 's losing his job			1
two months later , @entity8 was sacked			2
city manager @entity165 said in a news release , " the police chief needs to have the trust and respect of the elected officials and the confidence of the entire community			2
" @entity8 believes lack of confidence did play a role in his dismissal , he told @entity11 , but he also believes @entity165 faced political pressure and terminated him " without cause , " which was permitted under his employment contract			2
" i upheld my oath , " @entity8 said			2
" i 'm happy that at the end of the day i can walk away with my integrity			0
" asked whether he would do things differently given the opportunity , the 30 - year veteran of law enforcement said there always are things he could change in hindsight , but he stands by the investigation			0
at every turn in the 40 - minute interview with @entity11 's @entity10 , @entity8 doggedly defended his investigators , saying race never played a role in any decision and that his officers " conducted an unbiased review			1
" investigators knew letting @entity1 walk free for 46 days was an unpopular decision -- and they took abuse for it -- " but they performed professionally			2
that 's the mark of a strong police department			0
" @entity8 took issue with the media casting his department as apathetic or lackadaisical in the case			2
" a lot of the information that was given out as fact was misinformation , " he said			0
" it was reported in some media that we did n't conduct an investigation for two weeks , but yet in that same media they would show a photograph of a crime scene with crime scene tape , with patrol cars and blue lights and investigators on the scene			2
" @entity8 shrugged off the notion that he was hired to clean up racism and other problems in the department			0
his goal upon becoming chief was to improve professionalism and trust , and he set several goals , all of which were met during his 10 - month tenure , he said			0
one of his greatest regrets , he said , is that the @entity1 investigation ultimately shattered his childhood dream to be police chief of the community where he was raised			1
" it 's a dream of a vision that is going to be unrealized , " he said			0
" i 'm at peace with it on most days			0
i 'm a man of faith			0
