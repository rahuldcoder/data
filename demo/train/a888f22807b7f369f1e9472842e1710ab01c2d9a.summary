-- two years ago , @entity2 ' death was followed by a tidal wave of commentary ( the tributes , the @entity7 biography , the why - the - @entity9 - is - as - major - an - invention - as - the - lightbulb analysis )			1
as a result , most viewers will go into " @entity2 , " a biopic about the @entity14 co-founder and black - turtlenecked guru of the technocratic age , knowing two fundamental things about him : that he was a visionary perfectionist obsessed with melding technological form and function into products that would tickle the hearts and minds of the people who used them ; and that he was so possessed by that mission that he could be a control - freak dictator , a fanatic , an over-the - top jerk			1
still , watching @entity2 , with its basic warts - and - all accuracy and shrewd , unsweetened performance by @entity34 ( who was obviously cast because he looks like @entity2 , but who bites into the role with his incisors ) , i was surprised and frequently compelled by what a starkly honest portrait it is			1
the movie opens in 1974 , when @entity2 is a shaggy , barefoot college dropout			1
he picks up on the inventiveness of his friend , @entity46 ( @entity47 ) , who has figured out how to hook up a keyboard to a television monitor			1
@entity2 then fast - talks ( or is it strong - arms ? ) his way into a deal to sell 50 of these contraptions to a local retailer			1
they 've got just two months to build the machines , and the film neatly re-enacts the eager - beaver , geek - in - the - garage intensity that is the founding image of the home - computer age			2
when @entity46 , a burly nerd who works on this stuff mostly so that he can feel like one of the guys , takes out his trusty soldering iron to attach transistors to a flat green board , @entity2 channels the early paradox of computer culture : that to us the gizmos seemed light , virtual , magical , but to the people who invented them , they were built , diode by diode			1
at the same time , almost everything we see @entity2 do that does n't involve designing computers is unconscionable			1
he 's so possessed with getting his company off the ground that when his girlfriend announces she 's pregnant , he treats it as an imposition , something he had nothing to do with , and he develops the ( pathological ) conviction that the child is n't his			0
at work , his inspirational mission statements begin to teeter into harangues			0
as the movie goes on , @entity2 evolves from a grouchy hippie to a corporate sharpie in three - piece suits , and @entity34 lets his voice get more and more crisp with grandiosity , so that he 's not talking , he 's lecturing , because he 's the only one who grasps the inner truth of computer design as transcendence			1
he runs @entity14 as if it were an est seminar			0
anyone who is n't a fellow true believer is out the door			0
( even most of the true believers do n't get stock options			0
) like " @entity109 , " @entity2 is a technology yarn that 's really a high - wire business story			1
the essential tale it tells is that @entity2 , in the years after he founded @entity14 , became so obsessed with creating the perfect home - computer product that he turned into a bad businessman , tossing away millions of dollars in research , and bogging the company down while he fetishized perfecting the @entity117			1
a lot of the movie is about his battles with executives , board members , and @entity123 ( @entity124 ) , the ceo he hires away from @entity125			0
they all start off as @entity2 ' comrades and end up his enemies			1
i 'm a sucker for these kinds of big - money power faceoffs , and @entity132 , the director of @entity2 , stages them well , yet with a one - thing - after - another quality that does n't allow any one character to become somebody we care about			1
@entity138 plays @entity139 , the original investor in @entity14 , who sticks by @entity2 for two decades and ends up getting thrown over the side			2
i guess we 're supposed to be drop - kicked by this the way we were by @entity148 's lack of personal loyalty in @entity109 , but the comparison just reveals the difference between the two films			0
in " @entity109 , " the human drama behind the founding of @entity155 is volcanic			0
in @entity2 , @entity47 's deadpan flip performance as @entity46 strikes the most relatable note in the movie , but the only thing we 're really arrested by , apart from the spectacle of @entity2 ' bad behavior , is seeing him talk about computers			1
the ironic thrust of the movie is that @entity2 ' humanity is there in that perfectionistic insanity			2
he pushes and pushes to make home computers more and more appealing , accessible , and user - friendly , and that 's his great gift to the world			0
@entity2 gets tossed out of his own company because he 's too far ahead of his time			2
( ultimately , of course , he came back to @entity14 and triumphed			0
) getting ousted must have been devastating , but @entity2 does n't really take us on that personal journey with him			2
the movie 's fall - and - redemption narrative is generic , abstract			0
and maybe that 's because the reason that this movie even exists â € ” the notion that @entity2 is @entity184 who changed our lives â € ” has been , to put it mildly , a little overhyped			2
he did n't invent the personal computer , although he did refine it into something more seductively handy and even beautiful			0
personally , i 'm a devotee of @entity2 ' products , but even as @entity2 sticks to the facts of @entity2 ' life ( and what a difficult person he could be ) , the movie gets a little too caught up in his legend			2
