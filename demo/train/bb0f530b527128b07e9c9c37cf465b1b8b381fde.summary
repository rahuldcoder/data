-- at points , secretary of health and human services @entity1 sounded downright orwellian in her testimony before @entity5 on wednesday , such as when she explained that " the website never crashed			1
it is functional , but at a very slow speed and very low reliability and has continued to function			2
" prolonged periods of minimum usefulness , perhaps , but do n't call it a " crash , " she said with a straight face			2
on the other half of the television screen , @entity0 showed a live shot of @entity20 with the message displayed , " the system is down at the moment			2
" but in the world of @entity24 , a mandate is an " option , " expensive is " affordable , " and now apparently failure is " function			0
" of course , the problem with @entity24 is n't just the website , and the loss in credibility is n't just the secretary 's			1
president @entity33 and other supporters of the law spent years telling the @entity37 people that " if you like your health care plan , you will be able to keep your health care plan			1
" they said detractors who suggested otherwise were lying			0
they said @entity43 were just trying to scare people			0
the president and his allies were the dishonest ones , as is now clear to everyone			0
even while they were promising @entity37 nothing would change if they liked their policies , " the administration knew that more than 40 to 67 percent of those in the individual market would not be able to keep their plans , even if they liked them , " as @entity54 reported this week			1
already more than 2 million people have had their insurance plans canceled -- three times as many as have signed up for @entity24			0
yet the president continues to insist , as he did wednesday in @entity62 , that " if you had one of these substandard plans before the @entity24 became law " -- of course , it was the law that made them " substandard , " by definition -- " and you liked that plan , you were able to keep it			0
" in the same speech , he took credit for liberating @entity37 from those " substandard " policies			1
this is as good an example of " double - think " as anything we 've seen in @entity37 politics			0
while the president and the other pitchmen of @entity24 have certainly lost credibility , however , @entity1 in particular needs to be held accountable for the launch failures			1
she added the problem of terrible management on top of the law 's many flaws , and in doing so has put the health , financial security and personal information of hundreds of thousands of @entity37 at risk			1
across the country there are people who will have to buy insurance through the exchanges in just a few months , some because @entity24 caused their policies to be canceled , some because @entity24 caused their employers to dump their coverage			1
many of these people will face steep new costs that they were n't anticipating			0
but today , a full month after the exchanges went live , @entity37 who visit @entity20 to find out what coverage they and their families will have and how much it will cost them must spend hours of frustration trying to navigate a broken system			1
even more alarming , the secretary 's bad execution of the president 's bad plan could put thousands of @entity37 ' personal information at risk			2
@entity1 told rep. @entity119 on wednesday that she would have to get back to him on whether there had ever been a complete security test of the system			1
when the person who is supposedly overseeing a system into which hundreds of thousands of people are entering their personal information says she will " get back to you " about whether there has been thorough security testing , it is terrifying			0
and on top of everything else , the exchange website is a complete boondoggle			2
@entity1 testified the government has spent almost $ 175 million on @entity20 so far , and the real tab will surely be much higher after the emergency repairs			1
already , this is substantially more than @entity138 spent to develop the @entity139 , and even ( as i pointed out recently ) more than @entity141 spent on the @entity143 mission			0
it likely makes @entity20 the most expensive website ever built , and certainly the most expensive not to function -- although perhaps that word no longer means what we thought it did			2
these failures of management make the pain of a bad law even worse			0
i have always opposed the law			0
i believe it will fail and can not be improved			0
but most of all , honesty counts in public officials , and after @entity1 ' testimony wednesday she should have lost her credibility even in the eyes of @entity24 's supporters			1
it 's time to offer her the option of mandatory retirement			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are those of @entity169 .			1

@entity169 : @entity1 sounded orwellian when she said website never " crashed "

@entity178 says they will be forced to try to navigate a *dysfunctional* website
