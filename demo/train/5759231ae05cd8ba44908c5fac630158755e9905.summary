@entity0 makes his living plying the often treacherous waters of the @entity3 , delivering staples like cement to industries nestled in the myriad harbors that dot a coastline that 's equal to nearly half of the circumference of the globe			2
it 's not glamorous work , but it is critical to the @entity16 economy			2
and it 's getting harder			2
water levels in @entity19 and @entity20 fell to record low levels for december , and are expected to break the all - time low sometime in the next few months			1
cargo ships like @entity0 's are being forced to lighten their loads , some harbors have already been forced to close and the tourist trade is bracing for an impact as well			1
" in years past , there was always a buffer , " he said			2
" that buffer 's gone			2
" it 's not a new problem			2
@entity20 levels have been below average for at least 13 years , said @entity36 , chief of watershed hydrology for the @entity38 in @entity39			1
but it is an increasingly serious one : -- the coal trade on the @entity3 declined 8.2 % in 2012 from the previous year , and down a quarter off the 5 - year - averge -- in large part due to falling water levels and a $ 200 million backlog in necessary dredging throughout the lakes , according to the @entity48			1
-- commercial fishing boats are finding it increasingly difficult to navigate some harbors , risking a downturn in a vital part of the @entity3 economy , said @entity55 , an educator with @entity56 , which works with coastal communities on water - level issues , among other things			1
-- charter boat operations and other businesses in coastal communities that depend on tourism fear the impact lower water levels will have from spring to fall , when tens of thousands of people flow into the state to boat , fish , eat out and shop			1
fishing lure in @entity74 , @entity75 , a popular salmon run on the @entity73 draws tourists drawn by the lure of fishing a rare naturally replenished population of the prized fish , said city manager @entity80			2
" we see people from @entity83 , from @entity84 , from @entity85 , @entity86 , other areas of @entity19 , " he said			1
but low lake levels last year dried up the run , leaving salmon flopping in the mud , and forcing the state @entity92 to close the run to protect the population			1
it appears a good number of the fish made it to their spawning grounds , but if water levels do n't recover in the spring , the narrow channel through which the fish pass could dry up once again -- prompting tourists to find someplace else to go , @entity55 said			1
also of concern : potential access problems at some of the private marinas dotting @entity112 , @entity107 said			2
read more : sailing the world 's most beautiful lakes despite efforts to diversify the city 's economy in recent years , such problems would be a huge blow to the tiny community of 1,300 , the city manager said			2
" i 'm confident the community will step up , " he said			0
" but if there 's no water , we 're going to miss out on a lot of activity			1
" precipitation and evaporation the problem is a long - term cycle of too little water from melting snow and rain to counter the effects of evaporation on the lakes , @entity36			1
last winter , too little snow fell on the @entity3 region to fully replenish the lakes			0
while @entity19 and @entity20 typically rise a foot after the spring melt , the lakes only rose four inches last spring , @entity36 said			1
add that tiny rise to a very hot , very dry summer that sucked water out of the lake like a straw , and you have a recipe for the decline in lake levels under way today , eh said			1
there 's too little data to say the problem is a product of global warming , he said			0
it 's also a cycle that 's been seen before			0
@entity20 levels were nearly this low in december 1964 , and it 's the march 1964 record that 's likely to fall in the next few months			1
there is hope , he said			0
records dating back to 1918 would seem to indicate a cyclical pattern that could well result in record lake levels in the next few years , he said			1
such swings occurred in the 1970s and 1980s after similar low points			1
dredging backlog but even if the water returns , what would appear to be a more intractable problem looms : @entity176			1
groups with interests in the economy of the @entity3 say @entity176 has failed to appropriate enough money to keep up with a growing backlog of dredging jobs needed to keep harbors clear for larger boats			0
as a result , 17 million tons of sediment -- runoff from farms , mostly -- built up in harbors and other critical areas , said @entity191 , vice president of the @entity48 , a trade association for commercial cargo interests			1
@entity75 sen. @entity193 has been pushing @entity176 to appropriate an unspent balance of nearly $ 7 billion in a trust fund designed to pay for such work , but to little avail so far -- much to the chagrin of interests along the lakeshore			0
the fund takes in $ 1.6 billion a year , but only spends $ 800 million a year nationside , @entity201 said			0
" the money is there , " he said			0
" they just need to use it			0
" wasting away the concern about lake levels has even spread to @entity211 's wastewater treatment program , where a spate of recent media coverage worried that declining lake levels could cause the heavily managed @entity215 to reverse its course and dump sewage into @entity19			1
@entity211 's @entity218 issued a press released friday batting down the theory , saying it 's just not possible for such a thing to happen			0
but it could result in restrictions on river traffic as the agency works with the corps to ensure problems with low oxygen levels in the river , the agency said in its relase			1
" we are not in a crisis at this time nor do we anticipate being in a crisis this year even if the drought should continue , " the agency said			0
light loads while the big deepwater ships that carry huge quantities of the nation 's iron ore , coal and other goods are able to steam the deep waters of the @entity3 as they always have , they must carry ever lighter loads to avoid grounding on the increasingly shallow harbors where they unload			0
for instance , @entity191 visited a ship friday in @entity251 , @entity252 that 's designed to carry 76,000 tons of iron ore			0
because of low water levels and the harbors filing with silt , it can only carry 58,000 tons , he said			1
as of now , light - loading is merely a matter of efficency , @entity201 said			1
but that 's in large part because the fragile economic recovery has not yet put a full burner under the nation 's industry			0
" we can meet demand now because the economy is not fully recovered , " he said			0
" if demand for all of the cargo we move was at peak levels , we could not			2
" while the situation has not yet resulted in job losses among ship crews , @entity274 said some of the businesses to which he 's long delivered supplies are shutting down because the harbors are just too unreliable			2
others are switching to truck and rail to bring supplies			0
some harbors also are planning to shut down , said @entity55 , while others may not be able to accommodate some larger recreational and charter boats that bring tourists to the region when the weather warms			2
that worries @entity293 , the owner of @entity295 's restaurant in @entity74			0
about 70 percent of his sales come during the summer fishing season			0
" if they ca n't get into the harbor and go fish , they 're not going to be coming into my restaurant and ordering food and beverages , " he said			0
still he said , he 's pretty sure things will return to normal in a few years			0
" this has happened before in the living man 's memory , " he said			0
" it 's cyclical , and we 'll recover			0

water levels in @entity19 and @entity20 are expected to set a record low
dry conditions are *accelerating* a long - term trend , *forecaster* says
commercial shipping , recreational boaters are facing issues
the tourist trade also could suffer , experts say
