-- @entity2 's cover story " @entity3 " has inspired a comedic rage			1
the magazine 's newest issue features an article by @entity8 , who purports to lecture the @entity9 on how to best handle @entity3 rage			1
@entity2 , in an effort to promote the article , turned to @entity13 , asking people to tweet their thoughts on the article , followed by the hashtag # @entity17			1
what happened next was not what @entity2 or @entity20 could have anticipated or wanted			1
instead of an academic discussion about the article , or hate - filled diatribes by @entity26 , it turned into something extraordinary			1
opinion : should @entity29 censor an anti-islam video ? thousands of tweets bearing the hashtag # @entity33 filled @entity13 , showcasing satire at its best -- the type , by definition , which uses " wit , irony , or sarcasm used to expose and discredit vice or folly			1
" the tweets -- posted mostly by @entity42 it seems -- are a comedic roast of the specious proposition that was peddled to us by @entity2 and @entity20			1
here are just a few samples : @entity48 ‏ @ @entity49 when everyone in history class turns to you once 9/11 is brought up			0
# @entity17 @entity53 ‏ @ petey_jee i told my shrink i was feeling suicidal and he reported me to the @entity56 # muslimrage @entity57 ‏ @ @entity58 when i wear a white hijab to a tv interview with a white backdrop			0
# @entity62 # @entity17 @entity63 ‏ @ jricole @entity65 ' experts ' saying @entity66 is an " @entity67 " country			0
# @entity17 @entity68 ‏ @ @entity69 could n't toss football around since the ball was made of pigskin @entity72 and as @entity75 professor @entity74 poignantly and instructively tweeted : @entity74 ‏ @ rezaaslan memo to those few violent @entity79 protesters , this is how you fight @entity81			2
you make fun of it			0
# @entity17 we know that some @entity42 were truly outraged by the anti-islam video uploaded to @entity86 that sparked protests in the @entity79			0
some of those protests were peaceful , while others turned violent and deadly			2
we also know that plenty of @entity42 were horrified by the killing of ambassador @entity92 and three other @entity93 in @entity94			0
the @entity93 government is looking into whether this atrocity was premeditated or not			0
what is disheartening is that some of the media coverage of the protests embodies the worst form of sensational journalism			1
there were headlines and stories that made it seem as though millions of @entity42 across the world had taken to the streets , with @entity3 countries in riots and businesses closed			1
free speech or incitement ? @entity115 magazine runs cartoons of @entity117 one of the most outrageous comments came from @entity120 's @entity119 , who said on monday that @entity42 hate us because of the religion itself			2
@entity119 , to the deafening silence of his co-hosts , further commented , " if you gave every street vendor , from street vendor to prime minister in that region , a chance to throw a rock at the @entity93 embassy , they would			0
" how is this different from a radical @entity3 cleric telling his followers that every @entity93 hates them -- from street vendors to the president -- because of their faith ? @entity142 would be right if a majority of @entity42 in the world had been protesting			1
but that is far from the truth			0
in @entity148 , a nation of over 200 million , several hundred people took part in protests			0
just a few months ago , 50,000 @entity148 bought tickets to see a @entity153 concert before it was canceled			0
so , what does this say about @entity42 in @entity148 ? in @entity157 , a nation of over 80 million , about 2,000 people protested on friday			0
of those protesters , a few hundred were arrested by the police			2
in @entity162 , no protests occurred until monday			0
why ? because the pope had been visiting the country , and the leader of @entity166 , which the @entity93 has labeled as a terrorist group , did n't want to do anything to interfere with the pope 's historic three - day visit			2
a small number of protesters should not define the entire @entity3 population of over a billion			1
the media should know this and report the truth accordingly			2
reaction to anti-islam film fuels debate on free speech versus hate speech let 's look closer to home			2
monday was the one - year anniversary of the @entity186 movement			0
it was marked by protests in a number of cities			2
in @entity192 alone there were over 1000 protesters , with 185 getting arrested			0
do these protests imply that all @entity93 are protesting ? of course not			0
and remember the @entity196 this summer , which was held to support the fast - food chain amid a debate over its president 's opposition to same - sex marriage ? it set sales records for the chain and attracted over 600,000 supporters on its @entity207 event page			0
would it be fair for a foreign news media outlet to report , " @entity93 rage against gay marriage " ? no. the @entity93 media -- and we 're not just talking about @entity2 or @entity119 -- need to act in a more responsible way			1
it appears that our media are more focused on ratings than facts and accuracy			1
while the media jump on the story and then quickly move on to another story , their impact in defining a people and a culture can be lasting			1
let 's hope the wave of # @entity17 responses prompts the media to think twice before they react			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity233 .			1

@entity2 's cover story about @entity3 rage turned into satire on @entity13
@entity233 : the media need to be less sensational in their coverage
he says a small number of protesters should not define the entire @entity3 population
@entity233 : let 's hope media can focus more on accuracy and facts
