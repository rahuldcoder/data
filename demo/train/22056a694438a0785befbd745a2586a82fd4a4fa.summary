-- faced with a loud and angry backlash from some of its most active users , photo - sharing app @entity1 backtracked tuesday on new language that appeared to give the company ownership of their images			1
" the language we proposed ... raised question about whether your photos can be part of an advertisement , " @entity1 co-founder @entity10 wrote in a blog post			1
" we do not have plans for anything like this and because of that we 're going to remove the language that raised the question			2
" an update monday to @entity1 's terms of service had stated that data collected through the app can be shared with @entity28			1
that 's not a surprising move , considering @entity28 paid an estimated $ 1 billion for the photo - sharing service earlier this year			1
but the language that upset some of the app 's more than 100 million users said that " a business or other entity may pay " @entity1 for the use of user images and may do so " without any compensation to you			1
" that did n't sit well with some -- including @entity28 ceo @entity43 's wedding photographer			1
" pro or not if a company wants to use your photos for advertising they need to tell you and pay you , " @entity44 wrote tuesday on @entity45			2
@entity51 stopped short of vowing to quit @entity1 , saying he hopes that language will be deleted			1
the proposed changes are set to go into effect january 16			0
others were n't being so patient			0
a popular @entity45 feed associated with the hacker collective @entity58 was urging its more than 780,000 followers to dump the app tuesday morning			2
" only way to opt out of @ instagram selling your photos is deleting your account , " wrote the person who runs the account			0
" sounds good to us			0
the feed posted image after image of screen shots from followers who had done just that			0
it claimed it was receiving thousands of such images -- too many to count			0
@entity10 wrote that the intent of the new terms was " to communicate that we 'd like to experiment with innovative advertising that feels appropriate on @entity1			1
" " instead it was interpreted by many that we were going to sell your photos to others without any compensation , " he wrote			2
" this is not true and it is our mistake that this language is confusing			0
to be clear : it is not our intention to sell your photos			1
we are working on updated language in the terms to make sure this is clear			0
" the new terms appeared to significantly broaden what @entity1 can do with users ' content			1
currently they say , " @entity1 may place such advertising and promotions on the @entity103 or on , about , or in conjunction with your content			1
" @entity10 's post came after a morning when social media and tech blogs lit up with complaints			0
# @entity68 and # @entity1 were top trending topics on @entity45 for much of the day			2
@entity112 , who parlayed a child - actor stint on " @entity114 : the @entity115 " into becoming one of the @entity118 's earliest star bloggers , wrote that he does n't use @entity1			1
but he questions whether other " celebrities to some degree " could be exploited if they do			0
" if someone instagrams a photo of @entity125 walking through an @entity126 , does that mean @entity126 can take that image and use it to create an implied endorsement by @entity125 ? " @entity112 wrote			0
" what if the picture is taken by a complete stranger ? who gets final say in how the image is used ? the subject , the photographer , or @entity1 ? " even @entity0 's own @entity137 was expressing some concern on the site			1
" @entity140 will now be able to use anyone 's photos in ads ? without consent ? " he wrote on @entity45			2
" come on ! is there another photo app people recommend ? " @entity137 was n't the only one considering his options			0
" i have my fingers crossed that they , @entity1 , will listen to the voice of the community and reverse the new terms of service , but i 'm not holding my breath , " wrote photojournalist @entity149 , who has more than 163,000 @entity1 followers			2
he shared his thoughts tuesday on @entity1 , where he was posting blank black squares instead of his usual artful black - and - white images			1
" i do n't feel like debating the terms of service or being too nostalgic about the old days of @entity1 , i feel that it 's much better just to take our work and more importantly friendship and conversation to another place that respects our rights and ownership as creators , " @entity149 added			1
" let 's move the party to a new location			0
" bloggers also were spotlighting tools like @entity174 and @entity175 , as well as @entity45 's own new photo service that includes @entity1 - like filters			2
a year - and - a - half - old blog post from photo - sharing site @entity179 was also making the rounds			0
in it , @entity181 , which owns @entity179 , uses language , perhaps aimed at @entity28 , that says " ( w ) e feel very strongly that sharing online should n't mean giving up rights to your photos			1
" @entity10 said @entity1 agrees			2
" @entity1 users own their content and @entity1 does not claim any ownership rights over your photos , " he wrote			1
" nothing about this has changed			0
we respect that there are creative artists and hobbyists alike that pour their heart into creating beautiful photos , and we respect that your photos are your photos			0
" it is , of course , too early to know how many people were fleeing @entity1 on tuesday			2
but anecdotal evidence suggested a movement was afoot			0
@entity206 , a tool that lets users export and and download their @entity1 images , was reporting overtaxed servers tuesday morning			1
" our servers are very busy right now , so it may show you some errors , " the company wrote to a user on its @entity45 feed			0
" please try again later or tomorrow			0
