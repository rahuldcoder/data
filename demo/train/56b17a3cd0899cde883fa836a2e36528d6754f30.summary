@entity0 -- the global financial crisis has increased the worldwide trade in trafficked persons , says a @entity6 report released tuesday			1
secretary of state @entity7 says the report aims " to shine the light brightly on ... modern slavery			0
" the @entity6 's annual @entity11 also says trafficking has increased in @entity13 and slaps six @entity13 nations on a blacklist of countries not meeting the minimum standard of combating trafficking			1
the report , mandated by @entity20 , features data and statistics from 175 countries around the world regarding the amount of human trafficking that goes on within their borders			2
the report cites the @entity30 , which estimates that at least 12.3 million adults and children are victims of forced labor , bonded labor and sex slavery each year			1
" this is modern slavery			0
a crime that spans the globe , providing ruthless employers with endless supply of people to abuse for financial gain , " secretary of state @entity7 said as she announced the report			2
" with this report , we hope to shine the light brightly on the scope and scale of modern slavery , so all governments can see where progress has been made and where more is needed			0
" the report says the global economic crisis is boosting the demand for human trafficking because of a growing demand for cheap goods and services			1
" a striking global demand for labor and a growing supply of workers willing to take ever greater risks for economic opportunities seem a recipe for increased forced labor cases of migrant workers and women in prostitution , " it says			0
it predicts that the economic crisis will push more businesses underground to avoid taxes and unionized labor , which will increase the use of forced , cheap and child labor by cash - strapped multinational companies			1
@entity13 countries @entity80 and @entity82 are praised in the report for making strong efforts to combat trafficking			1
but six @entity13 nations -- @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91 and @entity92 -- were put on the report 's " @entity93 " blacklist of countries whose efforts to combat trafficking are inadequate			1
most of the countries are " source " and " destination " countries , the report says , meaning trafficking victims both come from and are sent there			2
most are trafficked throughout @entity13 , but many end up in the @entity109 , it says			2
@entity110 , @entity111 , @entity112 and @entity113 remain on the blacklist for another year , with the report saying they often become a destination for trafficked persons who are sold into domestic servitude			0
other repeat offenders on the list include @entity122 , @entity123 and @entity124			0
the @entity6 also put @entity125 in the @entity93 list , because of its trafficking of @entity123 refugees			1
the report cites information that @entity125 immigration officials sold refugees to traffickers operating along its border with @entity135			1
when the victims were unable to pay a ransom demanded by the traffickers , the report says , they were sold for labor and commercial sex exploitation			0
the blacklisted countries are subject to @entity143 sanctions if they do n't make greater efforts to fight trafficking			1
the @entity146 , @entity147 , @entity148 and @entity149 were added to a " watch list " because of what the report calls a worsening trafficking record in those countries			2
the 52 countries on the watch list have failed to to meet the minimum anti-trafficking standards but are making efforts to do so			0
for the first time , countries that have been on the watch list for two years -- including @entity161 , @entity162 , @entity163 , @entity164 and @entity165 -- will automatically be moved to the @entity93 blacklist next year without a presidential waiver if they fail improve their trafficking record , the @entity6 said			1
this year , the @entity171 also put out a report on @entity143 efforts to combat trafficking efforts at home			1
in 2008 , the @entity176 opened 132 trafficking investigations , made 139 arrests and obtained 94 convictions			0
@entity180 invited to tuesday 's event members of @entity20 who are active on the issue , as well as global advocates for trafficking victims , in an effort to give the issue a higher profile and shine a spotlight on the need to combat it			0
calling for a renewed worldwide partnership between countries and non-governmental organizations to combat trafficking , @entity180 said , " trafficking thrives in the shadows , and it can be easy to dismiss it as something that happens to someone else , somewhere else			0
but that 's not the case			0
" trafficking is a crime that involves every nation on @entity205 , and that includes our own , " she said , calling trafficking a " grave problem " in the @entity143			2
for the first time , she said , the @entity143 next year will rank its own efforts at combating trafficking along with the rest of the world			2
she expressed hope that it will be on the tier 1 list of countries that are making robust efforts .			0
