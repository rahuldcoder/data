@entity0 -- one of the most divisive issues in politics is set to take center stage in @entity5 on thursday as the @entity7 votes on a measure banning abortions based on the sex of a fetus			1
supporters characterize the proposal as a necessary defense of the civil rights of unborn children ; opponents consider it part of a broader so - called " war on women " and an ongoing assault on legalized abortion			2
the @entity24 would impose possible fines and prison sentences up to five years on doctors who knowingly perform abortions chosen on grounds based on sex			1
abortion providers could also be subject to civil penalties , including punitive monetary damages , under certain circumstances			2
@entity36 poll : ' pro-choice ' at a record low there is " evidence that the practice of sex selection abortion is demonstrably increasing here in the @entity48 , especially but not exclusively in the @entity50 immigrant community , " @entity40 @entity39 rep. @entity39 , the bill 's main sponsor , said wednesday on the @entity7 floor			1
" i refuse to believe that we can not find enough humanity in this body to conclude together that it is wrong to knowingly kill unborn children because they are baby girls instead of baby boys			0
" it is " hypocrisy to say that one is pro-woman and that it 's ok to end the life of an unborn child just because of its gender , " argued rep. @entity64 , @entity65			0
" since when did @entity48 subscribe to the idea that males are worth more than females ? ... it 's sick , it 's discriminatory , it 's sexist and it is blatantly anti-woman and anti-human			0
" women 's rights : nuns ' fight with @entity77 highlights @entity79 's global struggle rep. @entity80 , @entity81 , declared , " today the three most dangerous words in @entity83 and @entity84 are : it 's a girl			0
we ca n't let that happen here			0
" supporters of the measure cited multiple studies to back claims of a growing pattern of abortions based on the sex of the fetus			1
opponents , however , took issue with certain interpretations of the studies and warned of negative ramifications for women 's health if the bill becomes law			2
@entity104 rep. @entity103 , the top @entity105 on the @entity106 , said the bill " tramples ( on ) the rights of women under the guise of nondiscrimination , while doing absolutely nothing to provide women with needed resources for their babies , female and male			2
" citing opposition to the bill from groups such as the @entity5 , @entity103 said , " if this measure is passed into law , we will then require that medical and mental health professionals violate ... doctor - patient confidentiality " and report suspected violations to law enforcement authorities			1
rep. @entity127 , @entity128 , said the bill 's backers were " exploiting serious issues like racism and sexism ( as part of ) a backdoor attempt to make abortion illegal			2
" @entity7 minority whip @entity137 , @entity138 , said nobody he has talked to favors abortion based on sex preferences , and the proposal was brought up simply " because somebody decided politically it was a difficult place to put people in			1
" @entity146 , a spokesman for @entity7 minority leader @entity147 , @entity128 , called the debate over the bill " yet another distraction and yet another day that this @entity152 majority fails to act on job creation			1
" asked why the @entity152 - controlled @entity7 is taking up an abortion bill at a time when @entity152 leaders have called economic recovery their top concern , a spokesman for speaker @entity160 , @entity161 , said the party 's priorities had not changed			1
@entity165 's new ad zeroes in on @entity166 " @entity168 are focused on the @entity48 people 's top priorities : jobs and the economy , " spokesman @entity167 said			0
" dealing with a bill to prevent sex - selective abortion ... does n't change that			1
" the bill is being considered under an expedited legislative process that requires a two - thirds vote of approval for passage			1
while @entity152 would n't say why they were intentionally setting up a higher hurdle for @entity7 approval , the procedure avoids an extended argument over a divisive social issue with the potential to sidetrack the economic debate			1
@entity189 ' bill is coming to a vote at a time when abortion , a perennial hot button topic , has re-emerged as a political focal point			1
the anti-abortion rights group @entity195 released an undercover sting video this week showing a @entity165 staffer offering advice to a woman involved in the sting on how best to proceed with an abortion if her fetus is female			0
franks and several other @entity7 @entity152 are scheduled to hold a press conference thursday morning with the head of @entity195 to " address the growing trend of the abortion industry targeting baby girls in the @entity48 , " according to a news release from @entity195			2
a spokeswoman for @entity165 , which provides a range of medical services for women , responded to the video 's release with a statement noting that the staff member in question lost her job because she failed to follow proper procedures for the organization			0
" @entity165 opposes racism and sexism in all forms , and we work to advance equity and human rights in the delivery of health care , " said spokeswoman @entity222			0
" @entity165 condemns sex selection motivated by gender bias , and urges leaders to challenge the underlying conditions that lead to these beliefs and practices			0
" @entity165 's leadership jumped into the presidential contest on wednesday , unveiling a roughly $ 1.5 million ad campaign targeting presumptive @entity152 presidential nominee @entity166			0
the ad , which claims @entity166 would deny women critical medical services , is set to run in the battleground states of @entity244 , @entity245 , and @entity246			0
