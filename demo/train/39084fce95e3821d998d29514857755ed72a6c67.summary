-- in general , digestive diseases are hidden in the bathroom			2
you do n't talk about anything that happens there unless it 's with your spouse or a close friend			1
being ashamed and scared , you tend to pull back and hide			2
nobody wants to stand out on a corner and say , " i 've got an ostomy , " myself included			0
i have an ostomy -- just like more than 500,000 people in the @entity14 , according to the @entity15			0
an ostomy is a surgically created opening in the body that allows for the external elimination of body waste			0
they call mine a colostomy because it involves my colon			1
there are many types of ostomies , such as those involving the bladder or the ileum ( the final part of the small intestine )			1
my path to this crossroads involved being diagnosed with @entity37 's disease at the age of 17			1
the chronic disease left me doubled over in pain during flare - ups that sent me to the bathroom frequently for days			1
some of the symptoms people experience are nausea , life - threatening bowel obstructions , incontinence , dehydration , intravenous feeding , fatigue and depression			1
living with @entity37 's disease : ' today i will fight again ' my illness was punctuated by multiple surgeries , hospitalizations and a body fighting to stay alive			1
i am thankful for the amazing doctors and nurses at @entity58 who saved my life not once but twice			1
six years ago , my @entity37 's had gotten so bad , i had a temporary ostomy where my colon was reattached several months later			1
i remember my emotional status after that : i did n't want to leave the house			0
if my bag filled up , i did n't want to use a public restroom to change it			0
i found myself facing a permanent colostomy in 2010			1
i knew that i needed the procedure to save my life , but i was faced with the impending realization that my body and my life would change forever			2
faq : adapting to life after an ostomy i would no longer be able to hit the beach and take my shirt off without people staring or getting grossed out			2
nor would i be able to sleep with my shirt off , because it would mean one less layer of protection against a leak			0
i was afraid to leave my house or even let anyone see my bag ; i have even hidden it from my inquisitive 8 - year - old daughter			2
i found myself trying to cover up noises and smells that i was convinced others always heard and smelled , although they rarely did			0
i knew that i had to make a choice between living my life in fear or meeting this new challenge head - on			1
eventually , i came to a realization : i refused to be part of a stigma and go into hiding because of embarrassment			0
now i am sharing my story in an effort to help educate the general population about ostomies			2
we need to start a national conversation about ostomies and let people know they are not alone			1
@entity107 , president of the @entity15 , agrees			0
" it would break the stigma and the silence , since no one talks about ostomy surgery			0
people consider it disfiguring and gross , " he said			0
" @entity116 , like mastectomies , save lives , period , " he said			0
" unfortunately , all people focus on is crapping in a pouch			0
" designs to disguise and emphasize external devices you see , all of my fears 2Â½ years ago were for nothing			1
besides my efforts to raise awareness , i have traveled , gone to the beach ( my shirt stays on , though ) , swum freely in pools and oceans , and even gone ziplining			0
having the ostomy has done nothing to impede my way of life			2
if anything , it has improved it			0
i am no longer living a life inside the bathroom			2
my mission now is to convince everyone to start the conversation about ostomies			1
maybe then we can reach those people who feel lost and scared , educate the public about greater acceptance and , most important , raise awareness so that no one fears having an ostomy or knowing someone with one			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity157 .			1

@entity157 has had @entity37 's disease for more than 20 years
@entity157 had a life - changing colostomy about two years ago
