-- judges at the @entity2 ruled wednesday that @entity4 president @entity3 may be charged with genocide for his role in a five - year campaign of violence in western @entity4 's @entity10 region			1
@entity3 , who remains in office , has already been charged with war crimes and crimes against humanity			1
prosecutor @entity15 had the genocide charge on his original arrest warrant for @entity3 , but the pre-trial judges left off the charge when they approved the warrant last march			1
@entity15 appealed in july , saying that the judges ' standard for adding the genocide charge was too high			2
the appellate court agreed with @entity15 and ruled in his favor wednesday			0
the appeals judges said the pre-trial chamber had applied an " erroneous standard of proof " to the genocide charge			2
the judges said they were not ruling on whether @entity3 should be charged with genocide -- only whether the charge could be added to the arrest warrant			1
they said it will be up to the pre-trial chamber to determine whether to add the charge to the warrant , which could take several weeks			0
the @entity2 at @entity36 , @entity37 , is a permanent , treaty - based tribunal dealing with the most serious crimes against humanity			1
it is an independent court that is not part of the @entity41			0
it is funded primarily by nations , but also receives contributions from governments , corporations and individuals			0
even if genocide is added to the arrest warrant , @entity15 still faces a challenge in proving the charges at trial , said @entity52 , the executive director of the @entity53			2
" genocide is a much more complicated legal position to meet ( than war crimes and crimes against humanity ) , because you have to show in proving genocide that there was a specific intent to destroy , in whole or in part , a group based on -- in this case -- ethnicity or race , " @entity52 told @entity0 in july			1
" obviously , the prosecutor believes he would be able to prove this intent and so he wants the opportunity to prove that in trial			0
" the warrant for @entity3 was the first ever issued by the @entity2 for a sitting head of state			1
it currently includes five counts of crimes against humanity , including murder , extermination , forcible transfer , torture and rape			2
it also includes two charges of war crimes for intentionally directing attacks against civilians and for pillaging			1
@entity3 has traveled to several countries since the warrant was issued , even though any country that is party to the @entity2 has an obligation to hand him over to @entity36 , the court says			1
he openly attended the @entity94 conference in @entity95 , which ended this week			0
@entity95 is not party to the @entity2			0
@entity3 is the front - runner in an election scheduled to take place in april , and a genocide charge is unlikely to harm his prospects			1
a genocide charge could further isolate @entity4 , but it could also mobilize @entity103 nations around @entity4			2
leaders from several @entity103 countries have said the @entity2 has been unfair to @entity103 , and they have threatened to pull out of the court			0
the @entity41 estimates that 300,000 people have been killed in the conflict in @entity10 , and 2.5 million have been forced from their homes			0
@entity4 denies that the death toll is that high			0
the violence in @entity10 erupted in 2003 after rebels began an uprising against the @entity4 government			1
to counter the rebels , @entity4 authorities armed and cooperated with @entity122 militias that went from village to village in @entity10 , killing , torturing and raping residents , according to the @entity41 , @entity118 governments and human rights organizations			2
the militias targeted civilian members of tribes from which the rebels drew strength			0
@entity0 's @entity130 contributed to this report .			0

@entity2 judges rule @entity4 president @entity3 can be charged with genocide
charges would *relate* to his role in a five - year campaign of violence in @entity10
