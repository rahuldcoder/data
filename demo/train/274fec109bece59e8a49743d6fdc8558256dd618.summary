@entity0 , @entity1 -- hurling insults against @entity1 president @entity6 , crowds of demonstrators marched through the boulevards of eastern @entity0 to protest his anti-crime measures			1
organized by 50 human rights and activist groups , labor unions and political opponents of @entity6 the cortege of protesters at one point stretched a mile and a half from the @entity18 to the @entity19 , where a stained @entity1 flag was hung on a central monument			1
organizers said 50,000 filled the streets , though police put the official estimate at 12,000			0
referring to @entity1 's contentious role in @entity28 , protesters held up signs such as " @entity6 , son of @entity30 , " referring to marshal @entity30 , who led the @entity34 @entity33 regime			1
organizers said about 130 cities in @entity1 are seeing similar protests against @entity6 's so - called crime - busting proposals which have led to the expulsion of more than 8,000 @entity40 , commonly known as @entity40			1
saturday 's protests erupted after the recent raids against camps in @entity44 and other cities that forced out a total of 8,300 @entity48 and @entity49 nationals of @entity40 origin			2
close to 10,000 were expelled in 2009			0
@entity40 are a group of people who live mainly in southern and eastern @entity52 , often in poverty			2
they tend to live in camps , caravans , or informal settlements and have been the target of persecution throughout history			0
but the @entity40 are not the sole targets of the recent anti-immigration security measures proposed by the @entity1 government , protesters claim			1
groups representing other causes voiced their concerns at the @entity0 rally as well , including advocates of illegal immigrants and demonstrators demanding better housing			0
after recent anti-police attacks , the country 's parliament is considering new laws to take away @entity1 citizenship from naturalized immigrants guilty of crimes like attacks on police , polygamy or female circumcision , traditions associated with some immigrant groups			1
some believe @entity6 's approach of blaming immigrants for security problems flies in the face of @entity1 's democratic fundamentals -- liberty , equality and fraternity			1
" he is not fighting crime ... he is deliberately putting into question the basic principles of republican equality , and what is already an extremely serious social and economic crisis now threatens the cohesion of all society , " organizations supporting the protests said in a statement posted on the @entity105 's website saturday			2
when he announced the proposals in july , @entity6 said @entity1 citizenship was a privilege			1
" one must earn @entity1 nationality and be worthy of it , " he said			0
" anyone who fires on an agent enforcing order no longer deserves to be @entity1			0
" immigration policy has long been a top issue for the conservative @entity6			2
as interior minister , he advocated the deportation of foreign nationals caught in violent riots across @entity1 in 2005			2
but the recent crackdowns have drawn criticism even within @entity6 's government			0
local media reported that foreign minister @entity123 said he was shocked by the president 's anti-crime proposals			0
last month 's ousting of @entity40 gypsies without valid identity papers -- drew international criticism with some comparing it to the deportation of @entity132 during @entity28 something the government said was absurd since those being expelled were being sent back to their homelands with financial compensation of 300 euros ( $ 381 ) per adult and 100 euros ( $ 127 ) per child , @entity139 immigration ministry said			1
@entity1 officials have said the deportations are part of a broader crackdown on illegal immigration			2
in his july speech , @entity6 said @entity1 needs better immigration regulations			1
" we are suffering from the consequences of 50 years of inadequately controlled immigration that led to a failure of integration , " he said			0
" we are so proud of our system of integration , but perhaps we should wake up to see what it has produced			0
" @entity2 's @entity159 contributed to this report .			0

protesters say measures are *discriminatory* and will not stop crime
