@entity0 -- democrats and @entity3 narrowly averted a partial shutdown of the federal government friday night , agreeing on a budget deal and a short - term funding extension little more than an hour before the clock struck midnight and time ran out			1
the new funding extension , which cuts spending by $ 2 billion , will last through next thursday			1
" the government will be open for business , " president @entity12 said			1
" in the final hours before our government would have been forced to shut down , leaders in both parties reached an agreement that will allow our small businesses to get the loans they need , our families to get the mortgages they applied for , and hundreds of thousands of @entity24 to show up at work and take home their paychecks on time			1
" negotiators capped days of frantic closed - door talks and public recriminations by agreeing on a framework for a package of $ 38.5 billion in spending cuts covering the rest of the fiscal year , which expires september 30			1
republicans , bolstered by their capture of the @entity39 in last november 's midterm elections , had initially pushed for $ 61 billion in cuts			1
opinion : how did we get to brink of shutdown ? a @entity3 push to strip $ 317 million in federal funding from @entity47 failed			2
@entity2 also turned back @entity3 attempts to get federal dollars currently set aside for family planning and women 's health turned into block grants for states			0
such a move would have given governors and state legislatures more ability to cut funding for services opposed by conservatives			0
sources told @entity1 , however , that leaders of the @entity2 - controlled @entity63 agreed to hold separate votes on both measures , as well as on an initiative to repeal president @entity12 's health care overhaul			1
lessons learned from past shutdowns @entity12 praised the agreement , calling the cuts " painful " but necessary to secure the country 's economic future			1
this " is what the @entity24 people expect us to do , " the president said at the @entity75			0
" that 's why they sent us here			0
" " this has been a lot of discussion and a long fight , " said @entity39 speaker @entity81 , @entity82			0
republicans fought to " create a better environment for job creators in our country			0
" senate majority leader @entity91 , @entity92 , called the deal " difficult but important for the country			2
" nevertheless , the furious down - to - the - wire talks portend even tougher rounds of negotiations when @entity98 takes up an increase in the nation 's debt ceiling and the fiscal year 2012 budget in the months ahead			0
if the negotiations had failed , approximately 800,000 government workers would have been furloughed			2
a range of government services would have come to halt			2
@entity12 noted earlier in the week that the mechanism of shutting down government operations had already started			1
an inability to reach a deal would have hurt federal workers , people who rely on government services and the nation 's broader economic recovery , he warned			1
belief blog -- my take : culture war in budget battle " for us to go backwards because @entity0 could n't get its act together is unacceptable , " the president said			0
top aides on both sides of the aisle had seemed increasingly resigned to the prospect of a shutdown			0
congressional staffers began receiving their furlough notices thursday afternoon			2
friday 's agreement to slash $ 38.5 billion in spending comes on top of two previous funding extensions that included $ 10 billion in cuts			1
republicans , under pressure from the conservative @entity137 movement to reduce the size of government , blame @entity2 for failing to pass a fiscal year 2011 budget last year when they controlled both the @entity63 and the @entity39			2
they also say @entity12 and his party are ignoring the peril of rising federal deficits and the national debt			1
@entity2 call the $ 61 billion in cuts initially pushed by the @entity3 extreme , and argue reductions of that scale would have harmed the economic recovery while damaging education and innovation programs essential for continued growth			1
the budget brinkmanship showed the political stakes of the situation , with both parties trying to depict the other as unwilling to do what 's right for the country			0
it also demonstrated the cavernous gap between the two parties on social issues			0
@entity2 said the @entity3 drive to defund @entity47 proves the @entity3 is fixated on abortion and other issues related to women 's health			0
republicans repeatedly insisted that the size of spending reductions was the main cause of the dispute in recent days			0
@entity1 's @entity173 , @entity174 , @entity175 , @entity176 , @entity177 , @entity178 , @entity179 , @entity180 and @entity181 contributed to this report .			0
