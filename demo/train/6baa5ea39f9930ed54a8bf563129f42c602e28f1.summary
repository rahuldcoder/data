@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 is tired			1
but he 's standing outside the concert in the rain smoking a cigarette and talking cheerfully to fans after an energetic performance in @entity0			0
the long queue of admirers , many from overseas , is testimony to his fame , but if truth were told , most of them just want to meet the lead guitarist from @entity18			0
and if they were disappointed that @entity3 did n't play any songs written during his time in the multi-million - selling @entity23 band , the fans do n't let on			2
well , not much anyway			0
what @entity3 serves up for most of the concert in the atmospheric beachside @entity27 venue is a cacophony of white noise in keeping with the storm lashing in off the ocean outside			1
with up to four guitars , bass and drums , @entity3 is not an act for the faint - hearted			1
but melodies do shine through : occasionally on older songs such as " @entity39 " and the finale " @entity40 , " the volume eases for him to show what an interesting voice he has , one that was criminally under - used on the seven @entity18 studio albums			0
@entity3 's virtuoso musical talent on guitar is also richly on show -- he has been described by @entity52 songwriter @entity51 as the greatest guitarist of his generation			1
many of the songs are from his new album @entity57 , which marks a return to a rockier sound than his previous , more acoustic work			0
@entity3 seems in his element as a front man : his between - songs chat is limited to an occasional " cheers " but he seems to be having a scream			2
towards the end he lets his hair down by doing his famous back - flip and plays guitar with his teeth and behind his back			0
there 's no showing for favorites such as " @entity77 , " off the most @entity18 - like album " @entity78 , and while there are half - hearted calls for @entity3 's big @entity18 hit " coffee and tv , " it 's never going to happen			1
while he will always be defined by that band -- who reform again for the @entity88 closing concert in august -- @entity3 has now produced eight solo albums and is entitled as much as @entity90 is to a life after , or even alongside , @entity18 .			2

@entity3 serves up cacophony of white noise , but talent shines through
with up to four guitars , bass and drums , @entity3 is not act for faint - hearted
