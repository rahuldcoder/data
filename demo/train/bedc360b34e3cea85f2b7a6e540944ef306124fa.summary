-- does the @entity2 extramarital affair pose a threat to national security ? the scandal reinforces the risks of age - old intelligence - gathering landmines -- be careful what you say and where you say it			1
but analysts doubt national security was compromised			2
" @entity2 ' potential exposure to blackmail , and the dangers associated with the use of nonofficial e-mail accounts that he needed to keep the affair secret , made this a potential national security issue , " said @entity14 , a professor of political science and international affairs at the @entity17			1
@entity2 probe includes top general in @entity28 " the @entity29 concluded that this was only potential , and that no meaningful security breaches had actually occurred , but the affair created a risk that could have been exploited in the future			1
" @entity2 resigned last week from the head of the @entity36 after admitting an affair with a woman later identified as his biographer , @entity39 , 40 , a fellow @entity40 graduate who spent months studying the general 's leadership of @entity44 forces in @entity28			1
the revelation came during an @entity29 probe of another matter , and it led to the shocking fall of the celebrated and revered four - star army general , who once ran the wars in @entity51 and @entity28			0
the affair came to light during an @entity29 investigation of " jealous " e-mails reportedly sent by @entity39 to a @entity57 volunteer named @entity58 , a government source familiar with the investigation told @entity0 on monday			2
timeline of the @entity2 affair @entity58 received the worrisome e-mails in may , an official said , describing the messages as along the lines of " stay away from my guy , " but not explicitly threatening			1
according to a source with knowledge of the e-mails , the messages accused @entity58 of untoward behavior with some generals at @entity74 in @entity75 , @entity76 , where @entity58 did volunteer work			0
the e-mails detailed the " comings and goings of the generals and ms. @entity58 , " said the source , who declined to speak on the record because of sensitivity of the investigation			0
among those believed to be referenced in the e-mails was petreaus			0
because parts of @entity91 ' schedule were not public , the e-mails raised questions about whether the sender of the e-mails had access to his private schedule or other sensitive information			0
@entity58 , 37 , and her husband @entity98 released a statement saying they have been friends with @entity2 and his family for more than five years , and asked for privacy			1
opinion : @entity2 adultery no big deal @entity105 , a @entity0 contributor and former @entity36 operative , said the situation is troubling because @entity2 could have innocently told @entity110 secrets he should n't have in casual conversation			1
also , in a speech at the end of october , @entity39 suggested the terrorist attack on the @entity44 @entity116 in @entity117 , @entity118 , took place because the @entity44 was housing @entity118 prisoners there -- a theory , she noted at the time , that had not been vetted yet			0
the claim by @entity39 has since been discounted by administration officials			0
@entity105 said it 's rare in a relationship that a person would n't cross the line and say things he or she should n't have said			2
but " my gut is there 's nothing there , " he said , and that @entity2 did n't say anything he should n't have to @entity39			1
opinion : 5 things we 've learned from @entity2 scandal nevertheless , he said , the " potential is big here for policy and security implications			1
" " it 's a spy agency 's worst nightmare , " he said			1
" they 've let an outsider in , which is always a terrible error			0
" as for the morality of the situation , @entity105 said extramarital relations do happen when the @entity151 and the @entity36 go to war			1
the @entity2 affair : a lot more than sex " i would be more worried if he were asexual , " @entity105 said of @entity2			1
" it should n't distract from his legacy			0
" retired gen. @entity159 , for whom @entity39 once worked and who knows @entity2 , said he doubts security protocols were breached despite what seems an unlikely indiscretion on the part of @entity2			1
a senior @entity44 intelligence official said an extramarital affair by a @entity36 officer is not automatically considered a security violation			1
analysis : will national security scandal create national security risk ? " it depends on the circumstances , " the official said			0
the official also said @entity39 did not have a security clearance from the @entity36			1
another official said @entity39 , who is an officer in the army reserve , did have some kind of security clearance and that there are no issues with @entity39 having unauthorized access to classified information			0
" i do not know how she got that information , " said sen. @entity186 , chair of the @entity187 , referring to @entity39 's october speech			2
" we should find out			0
" @entity192 makes first comments on @entity2 ' affair @entity186 said she would investigate why the @entity29 investigation that uncovered the extramarital affair did not notify oversight committees about its investigation into @entity2 after the bureau determined he was having a secret and risky extramarital affair			1
@entity201 , a former bush homeland security adviser and @entity0 national security contributor , agrees the situation lends itself for the potential that security would be breached			2
" is there the potential ? yes of course			2
i think there 's no indication that there 's a problem here			2
there 's no indication this involved classified material from him to her			0
" she also said she thinks that @entity39 is " playing the journalists ' game			0
" " if she 's in an intimate relationship with the @entity36 director , he 's not her only source			1
" and , she might have heard the october remarks , made at the @entity226 , in passing from someone else			0
@entity228 : how @entity2 courted the press as investigators try to determine who said what to whom , it might end up as a " he said , she said			1
" and as a result , nothing will be firmed down or resolved			0
" i worry about the distraction that this now becomes for @entity239 and the media , " @entity201 said			0
@entity241 , a former @entity29 assistant director and @entity0 contributor , said there are always potential worries about having appropriate relations and the potential of spies			0
in this situation , @entity2 is " very experienced " and knows about security clearances			1
@entity39 has scores of military contacts and is an author and academic			0
but what if someone burglarized her house , for example , and found classified information there			0
could she be blackmailed ? " that 's the worry , " he said			2
@entity2 letter : ' i showed extremely poor judgment '			2

@entity2 had affair while @entity36 chief
could secrets have been passed casually ?
experts doubt serious breaches , but worry about potential exposure to blackmail
