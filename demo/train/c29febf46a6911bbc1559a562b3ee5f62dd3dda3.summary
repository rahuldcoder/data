-- it 's approaching midnight at the bottom of the @entity3 and a team of eager " tunnel moles " stands poised for a busy night 's work			1
employing a mix of hi - tech tools and no little elbow grease , the 70 - strong crew of engineers and maintenance staff will carry out essential repairs on the @entity15 rail link that connects southern @entity16 and northern @entity17			1
at 50 - kilometers ( 31 miles ) long and buried more than 100 meters beneath the surface at its deepest point , the " @entity15 " -- which consists of two rail traffic tunnels split by one service passageway -- is the longest undersea structure in the world			1
making sure this engineering wonder runs smoothly is a detailed and complex task			2

" you 've got the ventilation supply , you 've got the drainage supply , you 've got the main power supply , the water supply and you got the cooling supply			0
all of these things are vital for the day - to - day running of the tunnel , " he added			1
keeping track since opening in 1994 , more than 320 million people -- the equivalent of almost 5 times the population of the @entity50 -- have traveled through the @entity15 , according to @entity27			1
the route is also estimated to carry 550,000 tonnes of cargo every day			1
it 's no surprise then that rail tracks here wear out far quicker than those on conventional networks			0
after just 16 years of operations , all of the tunnel 's rails have already been changed twice			0
trains also bring in immense amounts of dirt and dust that , if left to fester , can cause long - term damage to equipment and infrastructure			0

" the service tunnel is 50 kilometers ( 31 miles ) long and we 've got plant rooms and control rooms all along that length			1
so quite often our technicians can cover 100 to 150 kilometers ( 62 to 92 miles ) in an hour shift where they visit different sites , " he continued			1
strict timetable covering such lengthy distances makes the @entity15 one of the longest workshops in the world meaning repairs must be carried out at a breakneck pace			1
engineers generally begin late at night and must have all jobs completed before early morning services begin			1
during the daytime hours a team of trouble - shooters ensure a prompt response to any emergencies			1
according to @entity50 work site manager , @entity98 , these procedures require close co-operation with both @entity16 and @entity17 based engineering and planning teams			1
" we 're all one big company , " said @entity98 in the spirit of cross-border tunnel bonhomie			0
" ( generally ) @entity16 teams do work on their own ( and ) @entity17 teams do work on their own but we also all work together			2
language is n't really a barrier			0
most of us are bilingual and that works both ways so it 's not a problem for us , " he added			0

others were even involved in the construction process itself , ensuring they know the deepest darkest recesses of the structure			2
given the tight timescales involved , this detailed knowledge is an invaluable operational asset			0
as the service of the tunnel expands , this expertise is likely to become even more important			0
future expansion @entity135 -- which currently operates services between @entity137 and @entity138 through the tunnel -- has already invested heavily in extending the capacity of their fleet			2
trains from @entity145 operator , @entity144 , meanwhile will be gracing the line come 2015 , opening up services from @entity137 to @entity147 , @entity148 and beyond			2
an extra three to four million passengers are expected to pass through the tunnel each year as a result of these developments , while increased trade between the @entity50 and countries on mainland @entity119 will also likely be further facilitated			2

how it is carried out will remain broadly similar though			0
" the ( work ) will adapt to the frequency of the trains going through the tunnel ( but ) we 'll still have the same tasks and inspections , " @entity157 explained			0
" the maintenance is always evolving and as things get older it has to adapt to it ... ( exactly ) how that will happen though ( as time progresses ) , i have absolutely no idea , " he added			2
either way , he concluded , " more trains can only be good for @entity27 " and their fast - moving team of tunnel moles			0
find out more about @entity179 and when you can watch the show on @entity0 here			0

every night , engineers and maintenance workers descend to the darkest *depths* of the @entity15
teams of workers clean and make essential repairs so that train services can run as planned during the day
on some shifts workers are expected to cover more than 100 kilometers in just a few hours
