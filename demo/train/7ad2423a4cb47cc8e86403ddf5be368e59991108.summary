sen. @entity0 announced his bid for a second term in the @entity3 on tuesday , launching what will likely be a complicated election season as he attempts to keep his seat and run for an expected presidential campaign			1
in a low - key campaign rollout , the @entity9 @entity8 declined to hold a traditional kick - off event , making the announcement instead in a lengthy press release that listed his local and national policy efforts			2
@entity15 poll : @entity16 , @entity18 top 2016 field in fact , @entity0 was n't even in @entity9 on tuesday			1
he stayed in @entity21 for votes and to speak at a @entity24 event			0
" what he just decided was he did n't need a big rally and a lot of fan fare , " @entity25 , @entity0 's senior adviser , said on a call with reporters			1
" he wanted what he has done to speak for itself			0
" the problem for @entity0 is that @entity9 only allows candidates to appear on the ballot once during an election			1
if he runs for president -- a decision he said monday is " four to six months " away -- that would pose a challenge come may 17 , 2016 , @entity9 's primary day			1
and if he wins the @entity46 nomination for both offices , the dilemma could come up again six months later on @entity48			0
@entity0 has a number of options to get around the law , but his team is n't saying — at least publicly — how they 're prioritizing the different paths they could take			1
" i do n't think we 've abandoned any option , nor have we settled on any option , " @entity25 said			0
' just to help @entity0 ' @entity0 's allies in the @entity8 - controlled state @entity3 tried to change the law through the legislature last year , but the measure stalled in the @entity63 - led @entity62			1
house speaker @entity64 , a @entity65 who played an instrumental role in preventing the bill from advancing , said it would have violated a clause in @entity9 's @entity70 that prohibits special legislation that would only affect one person or a small group of people			1
" where i come from , people think if you ca n't make up your mind on which office you want to run for , then you ai n't fit to serve in either one , " @entity64 said in an interview			2
how to run for president from the @entity3 @entity81 rep. @entity80 , a @entity65 who represents the @entity83 area , said he does n't think running for two offices will hurt @entity0 's chances with @entity9 voters			1
" if you like him , you 'll vote for him			0
if you do n't like him , you wo n't vote for him , " he said			0
" in all fairness , i doubt if it will cost him any votes , just like it did n't seem to cost @entity92 any votes			0
" @entity92 , a @entity95 @entity8 , as well as vice president @entity96 , both ran for their seats in @entity98 when they appeared as running mates on the 2012 and 2008 presidential ballots , respectively			2
@entity0 dives back into @entity102 debate the backlash , @entity80 said , would come if @entity8 were able to push through a law " just to help @entity0			1
" but that seems highly unlikely			0
because @entity63 were able to maintain control of the @entity62 in the midterms , it looks like the law will stay in place			0
going to court @entity0 recently labeled the dilemma a " fairness issue , " pointing to other states where such a law does n't exist			1
" should people who live in @entity119 get the chance to vote for one of their favorite sons or daughters twice , and people in @entity9 not ? " he said in an interview with the liberal - leaning news outlet @entity117			2
" i think eligibility for office has to be uniform across the states			0
" the @entity81 @entity70 requires only three qualifications for the @entity3 : the person must be at least 30 , a citizen for at least nine years and an inhabitant of the state where he or she wants to be elected			2
in @entity0 's view , a law requiring him to appear on the ballot only once would be considered an additional qualification			1
" the @entity70 set the requirements for eligibility for office that states ca n't modify for federal office ; they can modify for state office , but i think that 's actually a case that could be won , " he said			0
@entity0 urges @entity98 to declare war on @entity148 a court challenge would be one of his options			1
@entity0 referenced a case known as @entity153 vs. @entity154 in which the @entity155 ruled that states do n't have a right to add qualifications to federal offices			2
but @entity160 , a law professor at the @entity161 , said a legal challenge may be an uphill battle			0
" it 's not a slam dunk either way			0
i think the constitutional arguments are very difficult for him , " he said , adding that state legislatures have wide leeway in deciding how to elect presidential candidates			0
the @entity155 , he continued , has ruled in the past that there 's no fundamental right to be a candidate			0
" i do n't think this law adds a qualification on him , " @entity160 said			0
changing up the system another dual campaign possibility would be if the @entity46 changes its presidential primary to a caucus or convention system			0
in that scenario , @entity0 's name would n't be on the ballot			1
" that would overcome , really , i think , the problem there , " @entity0 told salon			2
@entity0 : @entity192 declaring ' constitutional war ' @entity25 confirmed tuesday that @entity0 's political team has been talking to the @entity46 about changing the system , but he stressed that those discussions were already ongoing within the party and were not started by @entity0			1
an earlier nominating contest in @entity9 would also bring more national attention to the state during a highly - anticipated election year			2
the state 's @entity46 did not respond to a request for comment about the possibility			0
@entity206 , an adviser to @entity0 and a former adviser to @entity0 's father , ex- rep. @entity208 , argued that it 's a bold move for the state party to contemplate the idea			1
" you either have to be a very popular person with the electorate , or you have to be a very powerful person with a lot of ious and a reputation for being tough to get away with it , " @entity206 said			0
if @entity0 wins the @entity46 nomination , however , he 'd still face the same problem in the november general election — when everything would be on the ballot			1
in that case , he would need to drop his senatorial bid			0
a third possibility would be for @entity0 to simply not appear on the @entity9 primary ballot as a presidential candidate			1
he has to decide by late january 2016 whether he 'll file to be a candidate in the state 's presidential primary			2
that deadline comes before the @entity235 caucuses — the first - in - the - nation nominating contest — but a nearly a year after @entity0 will have already been campaigning			2
by that time , he 'd have a better sense of where he stands in the @entity46 field			0
@entity80 said he thinks that 's probably @entity0 's best option			1
" just give up the @entity9 delegates and run for president in 49 states , " he said			1
and based on previous primary calendars , the presumptive @entity46 nominee is usually decided long before may , so there 's a chance @entity9 would not even be in play for @entity8 candidates .			2

sen. @entity0 announced he 's running for *re-election* to the @entity3
he 's also expected to run for president at the same time in 2016
but a @entity9 law prevents him from being on the ballot twice
he has a few other options to get around the law
