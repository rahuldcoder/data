@entity0 -- the attorney representing two men suing @entity4 for alleged groping apologized friday to @entity4 's attorney for how one of the plaintiffs was wrong about the date of one alleged attack			1
that plaintiff , identified as @entity14 no. 1 , will remain in the federal lawsuit but will be represented by a different lawyer , attorney @entity11 told @entity1			1
@entity4 's attorney , @entity17 , has said the actor denies the lawsuit 's allegations that he groped two massage therapists while on their massage tables			1
the suit seeks $ 2 million in damages for each plaintiff			2
" i want to apologize to @entity17			0
it must be very upsetting , " @entity11 told @entity1 about how @entity14 no. 1 provided the wrong date of january 16 for an alleged groping incident in a bungalow at the @entity30			1
" i believed i was on solid ground or i would n't have given the dates on any court papers or to mr. @entity17 , " said @entity11 , an attorney based in @entity31 , @entity32			2
@entity14 no. 1 " needs a fresh lawyer to handle the case and we 're working on that , " @entity11 said			0
" he needs someone to handle the case who has n't made any mistakes			0
" the current petition will be amended once the new lawyer is hired for @entity14 no. 1 , and that lawyer would rewrite the section relating to that client , @entity11 said			0
@entity14 no. 2 will still be represented by @entity11 and remain on the same lawsuit , the attorney said			1
this week , @entity4 's lawyer argued a time - stamped photograph and a restaurant receipt show the actor was not in @entity0 when @entity14 no. 1 claimed the actor assaulted him			1
the plaintiffs are identified in court filings only as @entity14 no. 1 from @entity60 and @entity14 no. 2 of @entity62 , a move their lawyer says is allowed by federal law to protect victims			2
@entity4 's lawyers know their names , @entity11 said			1
@entity17 said that @entity11 filed his clients anonymously to keep other people from recognizing them and coming forward with evidence against them			0
@entity4 , 58 , has been married to actress @entity73 for 20 years			1
the oldest of their three children , @entity77 , was 16 when he died of a seizure while the family was vacationing in the @entity80 in january 2009			0
@entity11 said much of his practice is focused on going after sexual predators			0
he said he is not intimidated by the prospect of going against @entity17 , a veteran lawyer known for aggressive tactics in his representation of " a-list " @entity87 clients			0
but @entity17 came out swinging against @entity11 this week , first questioning the suit 's detailed description of the first incident in which @entity4 allegedly groped @entity14 no. 1 repeatedly and finally masturbated during the two - hour massage session in the @entity30 bungalow			1
the suit claimed @entity4 picked up the plaintiff in a black @entity96 and took him to a hotel bungalow where an @entity99 chef was cooking hamburgers			1
but @entity17 said that @entity4 " does n't have a black chef , does n't own an suv or a @entity96			1
" and @entity4 was in @entity104 that day to be fitted for his wardrobe for his film " @entity107 , " @entity17 said			1
he arrived in the city on january 15 , a day before the alleged assault in @entity110 , and remained there at least through the next day , he said			0
a photograph of @entity4 , which @entity17 said was taken at the @entity104 fitting , bears a digital timestamp of january 16 at 4:30 p.m. , although the time zone was not specified			2
singer also provided a receipt for a $ 382 meal at @entity118 , a @entity120 restaurant , apparently printed at 11:38 p.m. the same day of the alleged @entity110 assault			0
the merchant copy of the receipt does not include a signature			0
earlier this week , @entity11 had stood by @entity14 no. 1 's account of the alleged january 16 assault			2
" my client was sexually assaulted at 10 a.m. , " @entity11 said this week			0
" i can get there on horseback to mr. @entity118 's in @entity104 in 12 hours			0
that 's not that remarkable			0
" he noted that @entity4 is a licensed pilot with a private jet			2
the second plaintiff , who claims a similar encounter with @entity4 occurred at an @entity62 hotel where he was a staff massage therapist on january 25 , was added to the lawsuit tuesday			1
@entity11 said the case should be easy to prove because of documentation that was done soon after the incident			0
" he tells his boss , the employees all talk about it			0
there 's e-mails going back and forth about the incident			2
" responded @entity17 this week : " this second ' anonymous ' claim is just as absurd and ridiculous as the first one			0
" @entity17 said it was " obvious " that @entity11 " checked media reports that my client was in @entity62 working on a movie " before filing the second claim about an @entity62 incident , he said			0
" however , the claim by @entity152 is just as fabricated as the claim by @entity154 , " @entity17 said			0
" our client will be fully vindicated in court on both of these absurd and fictional claims			0
" unless @entity4 accepts an out - of - court settlement , the actor can expect to testify in public and on camera about the allegations , @entity11 said this week			1
" he 's going to have a videotaped deposition with me asking him questions and if he goes to trial he is going be on the witness stand answering my questions , " @entity11 said			0
" that is far more intensive and productive as far as evidence than any police report will ever be			0
" the lawsuit alleges that @entity4 called the first plaintiff , who advertises online with " professionally themed ads , " to arrange for a massage at $ 200 an hour			1
@entity4 picked him up at a @entity110 address and drove him to the hotel , according to the lawsuit			1
when they entered the bungalow , @entity4 " shamelessly stripped naked " in front of a professional chef and the plaintiff , the lawsuit states			1
" for the first hour the massage was without incident , other than he kept purposefully sliding the towel down that covered his buttocks to reveal about half of gluteus area , " the suit states			1
the massage therapist repeatedly slid the towel back up 10 times in the first hour , " reminding defendant that state law required that a massage client be fully draped during the massage , " the suit states			2
when @entity4 " started to rub @entity199 's leg , " he " thought it was accidental , " it said			1
later , however , there was more touching by @entity4 " and this time @entity199 told @entity192 to please not touch him again , " the complaint said			2
" defendant apologized , but then snickered to himself like a mischievous child , " it said			0
the lawsuit then described @entity4 allegedly touching and grabbing the massage therapist 's penis			1
" this was painful and uncomfortable , " the suit said			0
@entity4 apologized and suggested they " must have gotten our signals crossed , " and that he thought that the massage therapist " wanted the same thing he did , " it said			1
" defendant then tried to act like it was a simple misunderstanding			0
" @entity4 then asked him to switch places on the table for a " reverse massage , " the lawsuit states			1
@entity4 allegedly offered to perform a sexual act on the therapist			2
although the therapist " felt very afraid for his safety , " he agreed to stay and continue with the massage after @entity4 told him " ok , i 'll behave myself , " the suit said			1
@entity4 's statement " gave plaintiff confidence that his predatory behavior was finally under control , " the suit said			1
when he resumed with a deep tissue massage on his shoulders , @entity4 told him , " say something nice to me , " it said			1
@entity4 , who allegedly began masturbating , then got up and screamed at the plaintiff " how selfish he was ; that @entity192 got where he is now due to sexual favors he had performed when he was in his ' @entity246 ' days , " the suit said			1
@entity87 is controlled by homosexual men " who expect favors in return for sexual activity , " the lawsuit document quotes @entity4 as saying			1
" defendant then went on to say how he had done things in his past that would make most people throw up , " it said			0
the complaint said @entity4 told the therapist that " he was smart enough to learn to enjoy it , and when he began to make millions of dollars , that it all became well worth it			2
" when the therapist refused to take part , @entity4 said , " no problem			2
i will find new friends , " the suit said			0
he then offered to call a " @entity87 starlet " who wanted " three - way sex , " but " they needed to have sex together first before calling her , so this way they would be in - sync with each other sexually , " the suit said			2
the actor told him he could " make millions and be famous " if he lost some weight and adapted to same - sex relations , the suit said			1
when the therapist threatened to call police if he was not returned to where he was picked up , @entity4 drove him back , although calling him " selfish " and a " loser " on the way , it said			2
he paid the therapist $ 800 , double the $ 400 owed for the two hours , the suit said			0
@entity1 's @entity292 and @entity293 contributed to this report .			0
