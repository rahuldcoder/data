-- @entity1 must have whiplash			1
practically overnight this week , the @entity4 prime minister went from being one of the leading voices demanding that @entity8 's president @entity7 be punished for using chemical weapons , to a humbled , chastened politician with his hands tied			1
@entity4 lawmakers voted thursday night against even the possibility of using force against @entity8 , forcing @entity1 to concede bluntly , " we will not be taking part in military action			1
" what do @entity8 's neighbors think ? the vote was close -- seven mps out of the 557 who voted could have changed the result -- and the outcome was a shock			2
prime ministers are n't supposed to lose votes on the use of military force			2
@entity4 media said it had n't happened in hundreds of years			1
but although the result was stunning in one sense , in another it was n't surprising			2
over more than seven hours of debate on @entity8 loomed one chilling specter : @entity35			1
@entity36 : @entity8 is a problem from hell for the @entity39 @entity4 feels badly burned by the way @entity41 led the country into war there a decade ago , and @entity1 was fighting a defensive battle against the memory of @entity41 from the moment he kicked off debate in the @entity48 : " i 'm deeply mindful of the lessons of previous conflicts , in particular the deep concerns of the country of what went wrong in @entity35			1
we 're not invading a country ; we 're not searching for chemical weapons			2
" it 's an argument he needed to make			2
why @entity59 , @entity60 , and @entity61 are standing by @entity8 just a few hours earlier , the speaker of @entity8 's @entity63 raised the memory of the " dodgy dossier " which @entity41 's critics say falsely helped lead @entity4 to invade @entity35			1
and some lawmakers clearly felt burned by the @entity41 government 's case for war , based on false intelligence			2
even a senior member of @entity1 's own @entity73 warned thursday : " we must consider that our intelligence might be wrong because it has been before			2
" and we must be very hard on testing it , " @entity75 said			0
does the public care about @entity78 support ? " we can not ignore the calamitous lessons of the @entity35 war , " said @entity79 of the @entity80 , who opposed action in @entity8			1
that 's a very normal human response -- so common that there are cliches about it , like " once bitten , twice shy , " and " fool me once , shame on you ; fool me twice , shame on me			0
" it 's also the wrong response			0
it 's not @entity92 or @entity93 or @entity94			0
be careful in trying to follow history tempting as it is to base policy decisions on past experience , it 's dangerous			1
no two situations are the same			1
and yet politicians and pundits , generals and journalists do it all the time			0
traumatized by the image of @entity39 troops being dragged dead through the streets of @entity110 , @entity111 , in 1993 , @entity106 declined to intervene in the mass killings in @entity113 a year later			0
with those hundreds of thousands of deaths fresh in its memory , the @entity114 did intervene in @entity118 when concentration camp - style images suggested that genocide was going on there			0
any of those decisions could have been right or wrong on their own merits -- the critical thing is that they must have been made on their own merits			0
for that matter , @entity1 is not @entity41 and @entity132 is not @entity133			0
difficult as it may be , policymakers must not rely on historical examples because every case is unique			0
it 's intellectually dishonest to say the @entity114 should n't bomb @entity8 because @entity35 had no weapons of mass destruction ; it 's naive to say it should bomb because bombing @entity92 helped dislodge @entity142			1
@entity8 evidence and policy must be considered solely on their own merits			0
the story of the boy who cried wolf is a caution not to raise false alarms , but it also contains an admonishment for the villagers who did n't check the facts when it turned out there really was a wolf			0
as usual , @entity158 put it best : " we should be careful to get out of an experience only the wisdom that is in it and stop there , lest we be like the cat that sits down on a hot stove lid			1
she will never sit down on a hot stove lid again and that is well but also she will never sit down on a cold one anymore			0

lessons of @entity35 *pervade* *dramatic* debate in @entity4
no two *international* situations are the same
be careful of history
