@entity0 , @entity1 -- for many it 's the adrenaline , the thrill of scaling buildings to scrawl their gang 's signature in huge black letters from the highest point possible			1
for some , it 's also political -- a way to leave their mark on a city they feel has turned its back on them			1
they are @entity0 's pixadores or taggers , marginalized youth who prowl the streets late at night armed with paint cans and rollers			1
they have defaced buildings with @entity29 - looking lettering across downtown and along many of the city 's main roads			1
" where i come from , the only way to get famous is being a professional football player or drug dealer , " says @entity34 , one of the city 's more outspoken pixadores and gang leaders			1
" the other way is with pixacao			0
" just do n't call it graffiti			0
@entity34 says pixadores do n't want to be pigeonholed as graffiti artists and are n't interested in beauty			1
instead , he says they are rebels who want to defy authority and break the law			2
" it 's class warfare , " he says			2
" our society is very capitalist			0
you 're only worth what you own			0
with pixacao you can invert the values			0
you do n't have to have money to be recognized			0
you just need paint and you can write your name all over the city			0
" pixadores live in poor suburbs but their preferred target is seedy , downtown @entity0 , where visibility is guaranteed			1
they say that in the wealthy neighborhoods their signatures would disappear in a day			0
they leave their mark on bridges and underpasses , invade abandoned buildings to gain access to the top floors and scale skyscrapers by climbing from one window frame to another			1
some have fallen and died			0
see how @entity79 artists target corrupt politicians @entity81 emerged in the 1980s in @entity0 , a sprawling city of 20 million people where the division between rich and poor is vast			1
@entity81 has since spread to other cities in @entity1			1
well - known pixadores like @entity34 have participated in international art events but they invariably end up sparring with organizers			1
" if there 's no transgression , it 's not pixacao , " says @entity34 , who recently defaced a church in @entity89 when he was invited to give a workshop at the @entity91 there			2
while pixadores have fascinated art afficiandos , they do n't necessarily have many fans among the rest of @entity0 's population			1
" those guys are vandals , " an office worker says			0
" we were better off under the dictatorship when at least a minimum of order was maintained			0
" " we should have harsher laws and better education , " another woman says			0
on thursday nights , hundreds of pixadores converge on a street in the center to brag about their latest feats and plan their next targets as they drink beer and smoke cigarettes and marijuana			2
they spray the names of their gangs on walls and compose rap songs , about everything from @entity1 's consumer society to @entity127			1
they are mostly young men , but a few women are also active pixadores			2
a young mother and student , @entity131 says she formed a gang with eight other women			0
" it 's adrenaline , art , freedom of expression , " she says			2
" you have an idea and you want to rebel			0

art and law breaking is part of the same recipe for @entity1 street artists
pixadores or taggers scale @entity0 's *tallest* buildings to get their *message* across
@entity154 says the art must have ' transgression ' -- often a broken law
they see art as one of three ways to make their name -- soccer or drugs are the others
