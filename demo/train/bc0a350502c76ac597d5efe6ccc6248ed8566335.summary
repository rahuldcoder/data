-- the virtual cathedral for one of @entity4 's most revered cars will reluctantly fill a monster sinkhole that brought it both pain and gain			1
the @entity9 in @entity10 , @entity11 , also said saturday it and @entity13 will restore three of the eight vehicles that the 45 - foot - wide hole swallowed in february , but will leave the remains of the five others -- too wrecked to fix -- on display			1
" we really wanted to preserve a portion of the hole so that guests for years to come could see a little bit of what it was like , but after receiving more detailed pricing , the costs outweighs the benefit , " museum executive director @entity19 said			1
why was the hole 's filling ever in doubt ? visitor traffic since february jumped 70 % compared to the same period last year , as people lined up to see not only the brand 's past but also the newly mangled vehicles and gaping earth , museum spokeswoman @entity31 said			1
but the board learned that preserving part of the hole would cost $ 1 million more than it would to fill the whole thing			2
and the effort required to keep it safe -- eyesores like 35 - foot retaining walls and steel beams -- made preservation even less appealing , @entity31 said			1
" that 's no longer a naturally occurring , interesting sinkhole , " she said			2
@entity31 said the museum is n't revealing how much the renovation will cost			2
the project will start sometime after early november			0
the privately funded , not - for - profit attraction has gone from shock to proudly displaying its own spectacular damage in months			2
the ground opened at the museum 's @entity57 section in the early morning of february 12			1
surveillance video showed the hole devouring some of the eight cars that it took down			0
the hole was measured at about 45 feet wide , 60 feet long and up to 30 feet deep			2
@entity63 is cave country , and it turned out a previously undetected cave was under the @entity57 , @entity31 said			0
sinkholes pop up regularly in the area , sometimes caused by ground water eroding underground limestone over many years			0
after experts examined the cave and determined the rest of the facility was safe , the museum reopened -- and started letting visitors view the sinkhole behind plexiglass five days after the incident			1
by late april , visitors could walk into the @entity57 and stand just feet from the hole 's edge			2
the museum also brought up the fallen cars -- some sliced or mashed -- and put them on display as mangled as they were found			0
but on saturday the museum announced three cars would be restored , including a 2009 @entity90 prototype known as the @entity91 , among @entity93 's fastest production cars			1
also getting restored : the 1 - millionth @entity94 produced ( a white 1992 convertible ) , and a 1962 tuxedo black @entity94 , which was the oldest to fall			1
the others were too damaged			0
but their remains will continued to be displayed -- eventually back in the @entity57 , where an exhibit will be dedicated to the sinkhole , the museum said			1
@entity93 will provide nearly $ 250,000 to help recovery efforts , the museum said			0
the damage got the attention of gearheads worldwide			0
reports estimated the total value of the cars at more than $ 1 million			0
experts call the @entity94 the most collected car in @entity4 , and @entity93 calls it the " world 's longest - running , continuously produced passenger car			0
" since the ' @entity94 's 1953 debut , more than 1.5 million have rolled off @entity13 assembly lines			0
the sleek silhouette has transformed into a pop culture icon across tv , films and advertising			0
watch : how the museum has been showcasing the sinkhole @entity0 's @entity123 contributed to this report .			1
