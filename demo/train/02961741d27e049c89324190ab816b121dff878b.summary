in broad daylight , with no fear of being seen , a group of @entity2 girls -- some as young as 14 -- cross illegally into the @entity5			1
" because i want to see my parents in @entity9 , " one tells @entity6			1
moments later , another group of @entity2 admits crossing the @entity11 to get here , @entity14 station , a border crossing into the @entity5			1
" thank @entity18 nothing happened , " they say of the perilous journey			0
this group quickly grows to 22			0
most are children who traveled without any adults			0
unlike other stories of illegal immigration across a porous border , these immigrants are n't sneaking in			2
they 're showing up and announcing themselves			2
" we are seeing hundreds turning themselves in daily			0
and i mean hundreds at a time , " said @entity30 , a leader of the local chapter of the @entity32 , a labor union representing @entity5 @entity34 agents			1
many of the immigrants use rafts to cross the @entity11 , equipped with instructions to follow the river until reaching the @entity34 site to surrender			1
" they know that once they get to the station , we are going to give them paperwork and we are going to set them free into the @entity5 , " @entity30 says			0
@entity5 law prohibits the @entity47 from immediately deporting the children if they are not from @entity49 or @entity50			1
instead , the children are turned over to @entity54 supervision " within 72 hours of @entity47 taking them into custody , " an official said			1
" most of the time , they 're getting released to relatives in the @entity5 , " @entity30 said			2
" there 's nowhere to put them , so they 're released on their own recognizance and have a pending court date			2
i 'd say between 95 and 97 % of adults or youths do n't show up for court			2
" the numbers are staggering			0
he estimates that more than 60,000 unaccompanied juveniles will cross in 2014 and that the numbers will rise from there			1
" you 're talking kids from 17 years old , on down to some that are 5 or 6 years old , traveling by themselves , " @entity30 says			2
more on @entity80 : your immigration stories last year , roughly 10 % of people caught by @entity34 agents were minors , according to a @entity34 official			1
@entity85 has been so overwhelmed that federal officials are transporting busloads of immigrants , including minors , to @entity90			0
@entity90 gov. @entity91 slammed the move			0
" not only does the federal government have no plan to stop this disgraceful policy , it also has no plan to deal with the endless waves of illegal aliens once they are released here , " she said in a statement			0
official : @entity104 administration will enforce its priorities , not @entity90 's as of late last week , @entity107 was no longer releasing " large family groups " at bus stops in @entity90 , a @entity47 spokesman said , but children under age 17 are continuing to be transferred to the state			1
" the situation with the kids are they came by themselves , they have no relatives here , and the consulates ca n't keep up			1
there 's no one ( back home ) to deport them to , " a @entity47 spokesman told @entity6			1
@entity104 : ' urgent humanitarian situation ' president @entity104 declared the crossings " an urgent humanitarian situation requiring a unified and coordinated federal response			1
" earlier this month , in a memo to the heads of executive departments and agencies , he announced an " interagency @entity131 to ensure unity of effort across the executive branch in responding to the humanitarian aspects of this situation			1
" the group will oversee coordination with state , local and other agencies			0
homeland security secretary @entity141 is establishing the group			0
in a statement , he said that " addressing the rising flow of unaccompanied children crossing our southwest border is an important priority of this administration and the @entity47			1
" border facilities do n't have enough food , beds or sanitary facilities to provide for the children			2
@entity141 vowed that @entity47 and other agencies will coordinate to ensure a " rapid government - wide response in the short - term and to undertake broader , longer - term reforms to address the root cause behind these recent migration trends			1
" senior administration officials said they had prepared for a greater influx of children across the @entity166 border , but the numbers were much larger than anticipated in past weeks			0
administration officials would not offer specifics on the number of children in custody , most of whom are being processed for possible repatriation to their home countries			0
why now ? numerous factors have come together to create this unprecedented surge			0
many children are looking to escape violence and worsening economic conditions in their @entity183 countries			0
some want to reunite with their parents who left them behind with relatives and plan to return for them when they can			2
better weather is also cited as a factor leading some immigrants to decide to make the trek now			0
@entity30 says these crossings began to spike two years ago after the @entity104 administration announced it would stop deporting young illegal immigrants who entered the @entity5 as children if they met certain requirements			1
political battle rep. @entity197 , the @entity198 chairman of the @entity199 , calls the situation " an administration - made disaster			1
" " @entity204 has gotten out around the world about president @entity104 's lax immigration enforcement policies and it has encouraged more individuals to come to the @entity5 illegally , " he said in a statement			1
columnist @entity209 , who writes about the issue for @entity6 affiliate azcentral.com , blames both sides			2
@entity197 is " a card - carrying member of the @entity198 majority that has blocked immigration reform , " she says			0
and " @entity104 is n't off the hook			1
he 's been quietly managing disaster instead of yelling ' fire ' in this burning building			0
" the children flocking across the border in search of the @entity223 " should n't come , " she says			0
