-- progress in the fight against obesity , heart disease , and several other public - health scourges all but ground to a halt in the past year , although as usual a person 's chances of being in good health varied widely by location , according to the latest state - by - state rankings of the nation 's health			1
as they have in the past , northeastern states dominated the top of the rankings , while states in the southeastern @entity19 were clustered at the bottom			1
@entity21 -- with its low rate of infectious disease , high use of early prenatal care , and relative lack of violent crime -- was deemed the healthiest state for the second year in a row , followed by @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 , and @entity33			1
the picture was far less bright across the nation as a whole , however			1
increases in obesity , diabetes , and the percentage of children living in poverty are eroding the nation 's health , and the gloomy economic situation is likely only compounding these problems , say public health experts who contributed to the report , known as @entity48			1
@entity0 : the 10 most depressing states in the @entity19 " the economy , the despair that so many @entity19 are feeling , the anxieties , the tensions -- all of those things certainly could be leading people to make inappropriate behavioral choices , " says @entity50 , @entity51 , the chief of medical affairs for the @entity54 - based health insurer @entity53 and a board member of the affiliated foundation that helped compile the rankings			1
for instance , @entity50 says , eating a healthy diet -- a challenge during the best of times -- requires even more thought and planning when families and individuals are on a tight budget			0
" in a world where there 's a $ 1 cheeseburger available 24 hours a day , seven days a week , everywhere , many people may be making those choices too often , " he says			1
@entity0 : states that consume too much fast food the @entity81 has been publishing the annual state - by - state rankings since 1990 , in conjunction with the @entity84 ( @entity84 ) and the @entity85 , a coalition of government , business , and nonprofit organizations dedicated to health promotion			1
the report collects data on 23 health and socioeconomic measures from the @entity94 , the @entity95 , and several other federal agencies			0
the measures include straightforward yardsticks of disease -- such as rates of diabetes , obesity , poor mental health , and deaths due to cancer and heart disease -- with data on societal factors known to influence health , such as the percentage of the population with health insurance or a high school diploma			1
between 1990 and 2000 , the overall health of the nation according to these combined measures improved by an average of 1.6 % each year			2
after 2000 , however , the upward trend slowed to 0.5 % annually -- and this year there was no improvement at all			0
@entity0 : @entity19 cities with the worst air pollution " we really have had some stagnation in our health improvement over the last year , " says @entity123 , @entity51 , the executive director of the @entity84 , a professional organization for public health experts			0
" one year a trend does n't make , but it 's something to think about			2
" the current report is based on figures from about a year ago , so it likely captures the early part of the economic downturn , @entity123 adds			0
at the other end of the scale from @entity21 , @entity133 was again the unhealthiest state in the nation -- a spot it has held for the past decade , thanks in part to high rates of obesity , childhood poverty , and preventable hospitalizations			1
@entity145 , @entity146 , @entity147 , and @entity148 rounded out the five least - healthy states			2
@entity0 : the 50 fattiest foods in the states the percentage of @entity19 who are obese rose from 26.9 % to 27.5 % , and the percentage of those with diabetes also edged upward , from 8.3 % to 8.7 %			2
if these trends continue , @entity50 says , one in five adults will have diabetes by 2050			0
childhood poverty also is on the rise			0
roughly 22 % of @entity19 children now live in poverty ( which the @entity95 defines as a four - person , two - child family making less than $ 22,113 a year ) , up from 16 % a decade ago			2
and although children are more likely to have insurance coverage today than in the past , the opposite is true among adults , according to the report			2
there are some glimmers of good news , however : the percentage of @entity19 adults who smoke fell from 17.9 % percent to 17.3 % percent , for instance , and the number of preventable hospitalizations dropped from 82.5 to 68.2 per 1,000 @entity179 enrollees			0
@entity0 : the 10 states most addicted to smoking efforts to improve health in this country must focus on prevention , and should be tailored to individual states and communities , @entity123 says			0
" physical activity , nutrition , and tobacco : if we could get people focused on those three , we could take a huge bite out of the chronic disease epidemic , " he says			0
" this is not an infinite list of things that people have to address			0

as they have in the past , northeastern states dominated the top of the rankings
@entity21 has low rate of infectious disease , high use of prenatal care and lack of violent crime
@entity133 was again the unhealthiest state in the nation , a spot it 's held for a decade
