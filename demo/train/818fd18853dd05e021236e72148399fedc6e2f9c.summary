-- @entity2 's universe extends from her home to her first - grade classroom			1
she is a big sister to @entity5 and @entity6 , a piano player , a @entity9 student , a wearer of glasses			0
she loathes the patch she has to wear for one lazy eye			0
she loves magic and princesses and " @entity16 , " an obsession she picked up from her dad			1
the 7 - year - old carried a " @entity16 " water bottle to school in @entity22 , @entity23 , every day , at least until a few weeks ago , when @entity2 suddenly asked to take an old pink one instead			1
the request surprised @entity2 's mom , @entity25			1
it did n't make any sense			0
why would her little sci - fi fan make such a quick turn ? @entity30 kept pressing for an answer			0
she was n't expecting @entity2 's tears			1
kids at school insisted that " @entity16 " was only for boys , @entity2 wailed			1
her daughter said she was different enough already -- the only one who was adopted , who 's @entity37 , who wears glasses , who needs a patch			1
if sacrificing @entity42 for the color pink would make her fit in again , so be it			0
these were n't nameless , faceless bullies who taunted her daughter			2
they were good kids @entity2 ran around with on the playground			1
they were getting older , though , and starting to see what made people the same -- and different			2
now , it was about " @entity16 , " but @entity30 wondered what lunchroom teasing would progress to in middle school , high school or college			1
" is this how it starts ? " @entity2 wrote in her blog , @entity61			1
" do kids find someone who does something differently and start to beat it out of her , first with words and sneers ? must my daughter conform to be accepted ? " ' i need your help ' a few days later , in @entity74 , @entity73 clicked on a link that led to @entity30 's blog			1
@entity77 could n't shake @entity2 's image when it flashed across the screen -- a little girl with long blonde hair , no front teeth , square - rimmed glasses			1
" when you hear about bullying , it 's like an abstract concept , " @entity84 said			2
" when you put a face on it , an adorable little girl 's face , with glasses , it brings it home			2
" @entity84 remembered the isolation of being the weird kid at her high school			2
she was the teen who hit " @entity99 " conventions on weekends and got snide comments about it the rest of the week			0

bullying tragedies dominated headlines this year after a spate of suicides			0
studies revealed how deeply the bullies at school , home or online can traumatize kids			1

it 's tough to lay out anti-bullying rules for kids so young , but tougher still to know how to protect the bully 's perennial target : geeks , nerds and anybody whose interests stray from the norm			2
whole genres of pop culture are devoted to ridiculing them and @entity84 knew that @entity2 's story was how it starts			1
girl geeks are a growing force			0
" we 've all had those kinds of experiences , if you call yourself a geek , " @entity84 said			0
" it was about @entity2 , but it was about every girl out there , every geek out there			1
it transcended gender , it transcended age			0
" i know a @entity2			1
" so @entity84 did what any geek would -- she went back to her computer			0
" my fellow geeks , " she wrote on her blog , @entity152 , " i need your help			0
" ' you are not alone ' later that day , in yet another time zone , @entity156 clicked @entity84 ' post about a little girl and her " @entity16 " water bottle -- @entity2			1
@entity156 grew up on science fiction and fantasy , from @entity163 to " @entity16 , " but she was n't bullied			1
she was an @entity165 brat , always the new kid at school			2
with each new place , her parents reminded her to be whatever she wanted , and be proud to share it with the world			0
" i immediately had to say something , " @entity156 said			1
" the whole theme of the ' @entity16 ' universe is an anti-bullying theme			2
it 's good versus evil , standing side by side with your friends , doing what 's right			0
one of the most important things to stopping bullies in their tracks is to empower kids to stand up for themselves			0
" @entity156 found @entity2 's mom 's blog , sent it to everyone she knew , and left a comment she hoped would help			1
" i am [ the ] actress who has the great honor of being @entity193 on ' @entity194 ! ' i just wanted to tell @entity2 that she is in very good company being a female @entity16 fans , " @entity156 wrote			1
