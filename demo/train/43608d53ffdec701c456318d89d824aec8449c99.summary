@entity3 -- " anybody that wants to disarm me can drop dead , " @entity1 tells @entity3 's @entity8			1
" anybody that wants to make me unarmed and helpless , people that want to literally create the proven places where more innocents are killed called gun - free zones , we 're going to beat you			2

" the rocker and gun rights activist known for hits like " @entity28 " and " @entity29 " and nicknamed the " @entity1 " gives his unique take on firearms , @entity2 , and more on wednesday 's " @entity7			1
" when @entity8 pointed out that 80 people a day die from gunshot wounds in @entity2 , @entity1 argued that " 78 of those 80 are let out of their cages by corrupt judges and prosecutors who know the recidivism is out of control , know that they 'll commit the crimes again , and they let them walk through plea bargaining , early release , and programs			1
where you have the most armed citizens in @entity2 , you have the lowest violent crime rate			1
where you have the worst gun control , you have the highest crime rate			2
" @entity1 , a strong proponent of the @entity52 -- the right to keep and bear arms -- told @entity8 , " more guns equals less crime			1
" @entity1 went on to point out that legally owned guns in the @entity2 " are used millions of times a year to save innocent lives			1
" " i surround myself with positive , productive people of good will and decency , " @entity1 told @entity8			1
" so my view of @entity2 right now is so beautiful i can hardly stand myself			1
" " you know what i think about @entity2 ? " @entity1 continued			1
" unlimited generosity -- people traveling thousands of miles to help people they do n't even know			0
that 's the glowing , unstoppable good			0
" @entity1 went on to explain that what he does n't like about @entity2 is " what is being celebrated in politics where instead of being the best that you can be , we seem to be engineering more and more safety nets which creates , encourages , and rewards an uncaring disconnect			1
" @entity1 uses the welfare system as an example of that safety net , telling @entity8 " welfare is n't just about helping the needy anymore			2
welfare is now about rewarding people who take advantage of the corruption and abuse of that condition			0
" @entity1 pointed out that he is particularly devoted to charities which benefit military heroes			1
" i got guys with no legs that went into that war on terror hell storm knowing that they would probably not come out without any legs or arms and maybe in a flag - draped coffin , " said @entity1			2
" but they went anyway because that 's the warrior spirit that they have			0
and they 're still waiting for their prosthetics			0
they 're still waiting for the special wheelchair			0
but maybe there 's some child rapist in prison who 's getting a new liver transplant this week			0
that 's the corruption and the abuse			0
" " you 're very , very pro the troops and i get that , " @entity8 told @entity1			2
" but you , yourself , i mean , you dodged the draft			0
" @entity1 replied that he was happy to clear up the matter for " the ten millionth time , " stating " i did not dodge the draft			2
i was 17 and i was a clueless idiot			0
" @entity1 went on to explain that he was enrolled in a community college at the time and had a 1 - y deferment			2
1 - y classification -- which has since been eliminated -- was given to men deemed qualified for military service only in times of national emergency			1
@entity133 deferment was abolished in 1971			0
" did i register ? i registered			0
did i volunteer ? no. should i have ? yes			0
" when @entity8 asked if the @entity1 of today would serve his country in @entity136 , @entity1 said he would , telling the @entity3 host " there is no nobler sacrifice , none			1
but you have to be wise enough , knowledgeable enough to make such a noble decision			0
and i was incapable of both at that age			0
@entity1 told @entity8 that he holds so many benefits for @entity2 troops not out of guilt , but " because i 've learned that freedom is not free and i found it -- the reason the whole world sucks and @entity2 sucks less is because the @entity152 , the @entity153 outlines an experiment where freedom rules the day of individuality and that that can only be secured by crushing those enemies that would take it away			1
" " so those warriors that put themselves in the face of that evil enemy , " continued @entity1 , " and anybody who would take away our individual rights and individual freedoms , they 're the enemy			2
they need to be killed			0
and the guys that went over and did that , they had paid the ultimate sacrifice			2
" @entity1 went on to suggest that more @entity2 " do what the @entity174 is doing			1
get our heads out of our ass and get involved			0
this experiment self - government demands that we all participate			0
" @entity1 expressed his deep admiration for @entity181 , saying that the former @entity183 governor represents a " great woman , perfect @entity2			1
" @entity1 called the former vice presidential candidate an " ass kicker " who " got involved as just a citizen " and " became mayor because she voiced concerns that were supported by the majority of her neighbors			2
" @entity1 went on to say that he liked @entity183 so much because that state had @entity181 " taking care of business , fixing things , getting rid of wasteful taxes and demanding accountability			1
" when @entity8 asked @entity1 what defines a proper @entity2 , @entity1 said , " start with a positive spirit , really a herculean work ethnic -- not just a work ethic but one that drives			1
if you met all my family and all my friends , my band , my team , my management , everybody , they get up early , they kick ass all day long , they cover every detail , they wallpaper , carpet , get the job done and then , boom ! we go to bed later at night			0
and we set the alarm and we get up and start over again			0
