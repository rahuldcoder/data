earlier this month @entity1 's governing body punished @entity2 and @entity3 for holding an unsanctioned tire test -- at the @entity6 @entity5 it was @entity2 meting out punishment to the elite racing series			1
@entity6 home hope @entity9 lost the lead when the left - rear tire of his @entity3 began to unravel on the eighth lap at the demanding @entity15 circuit			1
it was the first of four incidents as @entity19 's @entity18 , @entity21 's @entity20 and @entity23 's @entity22 also had their races ruined by failures to the exact same tire			1
@entity9 -- and the 130,000 @entity6 fans who streamed into @entity15 to support the 2008 world champion -- were left counting the cost more than most			1
his problem handed @entity31 the race lead and @entity34 's defending world champion marched ominously towards the checkered flag			1
but there was a final twist -- and a dash of retribution for @entity3 -- as @entity31 's @entity34 ground to a halt with 10 laps to go			1
" we had a gearbox issue , " said the @entity43 , who now leads the championship by 21 points from @entity19 's @entity47			1
" fifth gear broke and it was not possible to carry on			0
it was quite disappointing to stop and retire			0
" the @entity3 of @entity53 inherited the lead from @entity31 and the @entity43 , who celebrated his 28th birthday this weekend , raced to his first @entity6 gp victory and second of the season			1
" when @entity60 stopped , i wo n't lie , i was n't disappointed , " smiled @entity53 , winner of the @entity59			1
" i definitely feel sorry for the @entity6 fans as it would have been a great ace for @entity9			1
" but there were too many tire failures today and they need to look into that			0
" @entity66 , who announced he was retiring from the sport at the end of the year , recovered from a dismal start to claim a brilliant second in his last - ever @entity1 race on @entity6 soil			1
" the start was a big negative for us and then [ @entity77 ] @entity76 touched my front wing at @entity79 and the race reset from there , " @entity66 explained			1
" i pushed very hard to do the business and in the end it was a very , very good result			0
it 's been a real highlight for me to race at this circuit			2
" @entity19 's @entity47 followed the @entity89 home and the @entity90 said he considered himself " lucky " to have avoided the tire issues that hit other drivers			1
" it was a lucky race for us , " said @entity47			1
" we recovered some points but we need to raise our game as our pace is not good enough			0
" there was some world - class racing in the final laps			0
@entity9 fought his way back through the field to finish fourth ahead of @entity105 driver @entity104 , who is nine points ahead of the @entity107 in the championship			1
@entity53 reprimand but regardless of the driving drama , tire failures dominated the fall - out from the @entity6 race --- even @entity31 's first retirement in 12 months seemed to dip under the radar			1
in the immediate aftermath of the race , @entity2 responded to serious safety concerns as the drivers questioned whether they were pushing themselves and their cars to the limit in safe conditions			0
" someone could 've crashed , " said @entity9			0
" i was thinking behind the safety car that it 's only when someone gets hurt that something will be done about it			2
" @entity18 , who was running in fourth before his tire failure , added : " what happened is unacceptable			0
" it was very dangerous for all of the 22 drivers racing			0
in order for us to race we can not have these problems			2
they need to do something for our safety			0
" in a short media conference after the race , @entity2 motorsport director @entity139 explained : " today was n't foreseen			0
we 've seen a different type of problem			0
" we are still doing our analysis so we have to go away and understand what 's happened and get to the core of the issue			2
we take these things seriously			0
it was one tire , the left rear			0
when we have the answer we 'll let you know			0
" @entity2 had wanted to introduce a new tire construction at the @entity154 @entity5 earlier this month but failed to get all the teams to agree to the change at a meeting in @entity158			2
the weakness of the tires had been masked in @entity161 but the high - speed nature of the @entity15 in the heart of @entity164 brutally exposed their frailties			0
" @entity2 appeared to come up with a solution with a different construction and that was being offered from @entity161 , " said @entity34 's chief technical officer @entity166			2
" two or three teams vetoed that because they were worried it would suit other teams more than them and because of that short - sightedness we have @entity1 putting on the worrying performance it did today and concerns over driver safety			0
" the sport 's governing body , the @entity176 , are coming under pressure to force through a change in tires with or without the consent of the teams			2
as a result , the issue is due to be on the agenda at a meeting of the @entity187 on wednesday ahead of the @entity43 @entity5 with @entity2 invited to attend by the @entity176			1
later sunday @entity53 was subsequently handed a reprimand after the race for failing to reduce his speed under yellow flags , which are waved to warn drivers to slow down , but no further sanction was imposed .			2

@entity53 wins @entity6 @entity5 for first time
@entity66 fights back from poor start to take *seccond*
@entity19 's @entity47 finished third
championship leader @entity31 retires due to gearbox problems
