i do n't know why we just have this in football -- in volleyball or rugby , we do n't have it			0

" whilst the alleged incidents are still under investigation by the relevant authorities , it is clear that all over the world a small minority try to ruin the wonderful experience of watching live world - class football for real fans			0
