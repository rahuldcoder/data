-- @entity1 said he was heading to the @entity3 area to go four - wheeling , nothing out of the ordinary for a 16 - year - old kid in rural @entity7			1
how he and three other young people ended up shot dead inside a car on that same mountain is now a mystery before police and the small community of nearby @entity15			1
a passerby discovered the car with the four victims , including a young mother , parked along a country road near the @entity21 community thursday morning			1
@entity1 and a pair of 17 - year - olds , @entity24 and @entity25 , were the passengers			1
@entity27 , a 22 - year - old mother of a young boy , was in the driver 's seat			1
three of the victims were current or former students of the local school district			1
" it 's something that reverberates through the entire community , " said @entity34 , @entity35 's school superintendent			1
" the loss of life is always tough , and especially ( so ) when it 's young people			2
" only one man has been publicly linked to the killings : @entity44			1
authorities said he was identified fairly quickly into the investigation and taken into custody around midnight thursday without incident on a parole violation in nearby @entity50			1
@entity51 , the district attorney general whose territory includes the crime scene , told reporters friday that his office intends " in the very near future " to empanel a grand jury to consider charges against @entity44 related to the four killings			1
" the citizens of @entity35 and @entity15 can rest assured that we have the person who committed the crimes in custody , that the community is safe , " said @entity61 director @entity60			1
profiles of the victims the 26 - year - old @entity44 had been booked in @entity35 five times before this , in addition to arrests in other counties and another state , said sheriff @entity74			1
he did not detail any of @entity44 's alleged crimes , beyond the fact he 'd been charged in 2009 , convicted , sentenced to prison , then released on parole			1
if law enforcement authorities know more , they kept the facts close to the vest friday -- including about how the killings were carried out and why			2
they have been working diligently since first learning of the deaths at 7 a.m. thursday			1
" they 're kind of like robots , they 're still going , " said @entity74 of the state and local investigators			0
" to them , it 's not a job , especially when they see the circumstances involve kids			0
" and then there are the victims ' families , struggling to make sense of the bloodshed in a place where -- as many insisted -- these kinds of things just do n't happen			2
@entity107 , who lives with @entity1 's family , said he dropped the 16 - year - old at @entity24 's house on wednesday afternoon			1
@entity1 mentioned that the pair were going to go four - wheeling at around @entity3 and spend the night at his friend 's house			2
the next day , @entity1 did n't call @entity107 to be picked up			0
" you just get that gut feeling when nothing is right , " @entity107 said			0
it was n't until thursday night that police were able to confirm what they feared : @entity1 was among those killed			2
according to the @entity121 , @entity1 had attended two local high schools , though most recently he 's been home - schooled			2
@entity25 was a sophomore at @entity124 , having recently moved with his family to @entity7 from @entity126 , said @entity34			0
another victim , @entity24 , graduated from @entity128 in may			0
as to @entity27 , she had a son who attended a @entity35 elementary school -- and whom she " loved more than life itself , " according to a friend who asked not to be named before they had not been friends for long			2
" she was very nice , she was innocent , and she could n't stop talking , " the friend said			0
located about 70 miles west of @entity138 and 110 miles east of @entity139 , @entity15 is a small city that serves as the county seat for @entity35 and its 57,000 people			0
it 's a place that the school superintendent describes as a " down - home type community " where " everyone seems to know everyone			1
" as a result , everyone has been shaken by this week 's carnage			0
students in the county 's 12 schools , particularly its three high schools , were told about the killings friday morning , then encouraged to talk about it in class or with counselors			0
" some were very quiet , some were reflective , some were more open , " said @entity34			0
" the mood at the schools was very subdued			0
" " it was just a surprise			0
it 's one of those ' this does n't happen here ' kind of things			0
it 's actually a grim reminder to us all that we 're all vulnerable , " he said			0
but what , if anything , made these four victims particularly vulnerable , leading to their deaths , has n't been revealed			2
was it a drug deal gone bad ? a theft ? a fight ? residents want to know , but authorities refuse to speculate			0
@entity181 , the sheriff department 's lead investigator , explained that officials want to be careful about what they release , while acknowledging that this case is personal to many : " there 's a lot of emotion that goes into this case just simply based on the age of these children			0

a passer - by found 4 people shot dead in a car on a rural road thursday morning
three of the victims were *teenagers* , one was a 22 - year - old mother , authorities say
authorities arrest @entity44 , after which an official says " the community is safe "
the deaths " reverberate through the entire community , " school superintendent says
