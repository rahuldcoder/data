-- she 's one of @entity3 's brightest medal hopes ahead of the @entity4 but @entity5 is n't relying on home comforts to help land her a maiden @entity9 gold			1
the heptathlete has had numerous chances to visit the newly - built @entity12 in the east of the @entity15 capital and steal a march on her rivals			1
but the 25 - year - old insists she wants her first trip to the arena to come when she takes to the track to make up for the disappointment of missing the 2008 games in @entity24			1
" there 's been lots of opportunities to go , i 've seen pictures of it and it looks fantastic , but for me i do n't want to become overly familiar with it , " she told @entity25			0
" i want to go down to the stadium when it 's games time and for me to step into the stadium with a big crowd and it will all be fresh and new and allow that adrenaline to pump through me			0
" hopefully that will get into my performance and help me perform that little bit better			0
" @entity42 broke through at the @entity43 when she claimed gold in @entity46 but last year in @entity47 , @entity48 , she relinquished her title to @entity51 's @entity50			1
more disappointment followed at march 's @entity53 in @entity54 , where she again was pipped to gold , this time in the pentathlon , by @entity58 @entity57			1
but she says both experiences have helped her to understand exactly what will be required to win gold in front of her home fans in august			1
" obviously i was disappointed with @entity47 and @entity54 , getting so close to those gold medals but not quite managing to keep hold of them was disappointing , " she said			0
" but i learned a lot from those championships and learned a lot about the areas i need to work on and improve			0
" if someone had said to me five years ago that i 'd have three gold medals at major championships and two silver medals then i 'd have grabbed that with both hands			2
" the thing i 've got to take from these past couple of championships is that i 've performed consistently over the past few years and always been in the medals			0
" too young to compete at @entity81 in 2004 , @entity42 was on course to make her @entity84 debut in @entity85 in 2008 , until a foot injury forced her to withdraw			1
given the impact she has made on @entity90 athletics , and the high - profile she has enjoyed since @entity46 , many people forget that this will be her first ever games			2
but she says although her battle with @entity50 and @entity57 is bound to be intense , she is determined to approach the @entity4 as she would any other event			0
" having the disappointment from @entity24 it 's obviously going to be a big year for me , " she said			2
" but i 've done lots of championships before , i 've had the experience there and i 've competed against these girls on numerous occasions so i 'm just treating it as any other championship			0

heptathlete @entity5 says she wo n't visit @entity12 until it is time to compete
the @entity90 athlete wants her first trip to provide her with extra adrenalin to help her win gold
@entity42 won gold at the @entity43 in 2009 but had to settle for silver in 2011
the @entity9 will be her first *olympics* after injury forced her to miss @entity24 in 2008
