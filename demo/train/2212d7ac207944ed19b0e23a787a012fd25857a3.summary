@entity0 -- shaking off three years of partisan freeze , @entity2 and @entity3 unveiled a $ 1.012 trillion spending deal monday night that would roll back some spending cuts , raise federal worker pay and have a surprisingly broad effect on @entity10 ' everyday lives , from the light bulbs in lamps to the lines at airport security			1
the massive bipartisan bill is a break from years of forced budget cuts and constant @entity19 funding fights			1
it would green - light spending through the end of september			1
" i think the most significant thing is this gets the train back on the track , " @entity24 chairman @entity23 , @entity25 , told reporters			1
wielding the power of one of the biggest purses in the world , the measure sets @entity10 's national and international priorities			2
and in the current atmosphere , the so - called " omnibus " bill may be the largest policy decision @entity19 makes this year			2
federal workers and military personnel would see 1 percent increases in their paychecks , marking the first pay raise in three years for most agency staffers			2
the deal also would protect disabled veterans and some military spouses from a pension cut set to go into effect in 2015			0
details of the $ 1 trillion spending bill appeal for both sides @entity3 ? they 're cheering a $ 1 billion increase in @entity57 funding from its recent low point after forced budget cuts last year			1
half of that will go to help children three years old and younger , touching on an @entity64 administration priority			0
@entity66 chairman @entity65 , a former social worker , also won millions of dollars for mental health programs			2
" this agreement shows the @entity10 people that we can compromise , and that we can govern , " @entity65 wrote in a statement late monday			1
what do @entity2 like in that compromise ? hits to two of their least - favorite agencies : the @entity79 budget will be at 2009 levels and @entity2 crow that they 've cut the @entity82 's funding by 20 percent since 2009			1
overall , federal spending is lower than in years			2
" everyone can find something to complain about , but from a @entity2 standpoint , this is $ 164 billion less than ( president @entity91 ) @entity91 's last budget , so that 's pretty good progress , " said rep. @entity84 , @entity85 , who sits on the @entity86			2
opinion : @entity10 's real problem is bipartisanship air travel targeted changes at the airports may be the most visible @entity2 idea in the bill			1
the omnibus launches several policies aimed at forcing the @entity104 to get more low - risk passengers through security more quickly			0
first , the bill would cap the number of @entity104 agents at 46,000			0
it would also require the @entity104 to certify increasing numbers of travelers as eligible for " expedited " screening			0
by mid-april , the agency must tell @entity19 that one quarter of the traveling public is " expedite " eligible			0
by the end of 2014 , that figure must be one in two			0
@entity104 representatives and aviation experts were not available for comment on the airport security policies at publishing time			1
lights and health at home , the omnibus bill would give @entity10 more lighting options and less efficiency			1
the measure stops implementation of a new light - bulb standard which aimed to gradually replace many incandescent light bulbs			1
that seems to be one of the secrets of the new bipartisanship : pick your controversial items with a light hand			0
thus , @entity140 does make a few appearances in the spending plan , but negotiators mostly tiptoe around it			0
the deal requires that a $ 1 billion " @entity148 " account , which @entity2 call a " slush fund , " be used only for , well , prevention and public health			1
not all big issues the word " @entity153 " enters the discussion as well			0
this deal requires that before the @entity10 can send any more foreign aid to @entity157 , secretary of state kerry must certify that the @entity157 government is helping to find those responsible for the @entity153 attack			1
the bill is not all sweeping , big issues			0
it also contains countless smaller provisions , like a ban on funding any new portraits of most officials			0
" what i wanted was a benign bill , " said appropriations chairman @entity23 , " ( a bill ) that would not have any earthshaking changes , and i think that 's what we have			0
" the @entity24 hopes to pass the measure wednesday , the day that the current spending bill runs out			0
leaders plan for government to then operate on a very short three - day funding bill to give the @entity66 time to debate and vote later this week .			2

the huge bipartisan bill would fund the government through the end of september
" this gets the train back on the track , " a @entity2 congressman says
it " shows the @entity10 people that we can compromise " a @entity3 senator says
the bill affects areas like federal worker pay , airport security and light bulbs
