here are nine reasons to think armed drones are going to be an increasingly common feature of warfare : @entity4 : armed drones are key to future of warfare 1			0
given the relatively low costs of drones -- already much cheaper than the costs of a fighter jet and of training a fighter jet pilot -- armed drones will likely play a key role in future conflicts			1
armed @entity16 reaper drones , for instance , cost $ 12 million each and have been frequently deployed against suspected members of @entity18 , while the f - 22 war plane costs around ten times that amount			2
the virtual monopoly that the @entity16 had on armed drones a decade ago is evaporating			2
so far , the @entity16 , @entity23 and @entity24 are the only nations that have used armed drones in combat			1
however , according to data compiled by the @entity29 , 82 countries now own some type of drone , and while only a small number of those nations possess armed drone aircraft , the new players in the world of armed drones include traditional @entity16 adversaries such as @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity39			1
building drones , particularly armed drones , takes sophisticated technology and access to the specific weaponry that can be launched from an unmanned vehicle			0
but governments are increasingly willing to invest the necessary time and money either to buy or develop them since armed drones are increasingly seen as an integral part of modern warfare			0
the @entity51 , a defense consulting firm in @entity52 , estimated in 2013 that the global market for the research , development and procurement of drones will more than double in the next decade , from $ 5.2 billion annually to $ 11.6 billion a year			1
@entity24 is the world 's largest exporter of drones and drone technology			1
the state - owned @entity63 has sold drones and drone technology to more than two dozen countries around the world			0
last year the scientific adviser to @entity69 's defense minister announced that a state military research firm would begin test - firing precision missiles from drones " in a couple months			1
a consortium of @entity75 countries , including @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 , and @entity80 , is developing an armed drone prototype called the @entity82			0
@entity76 plans to manufacture armed drones for its air force based on this prototype			0
in february 2013 , a regional @entity38 government posted online and then quickly removed photographs of two @entity38 - made armed drones			1
the two systems were reportedly scheduled to begin test flights in 2014			0
at a 2012 air show in @entity37 , @entity37 companies displayed full - size armed drones , the @entity95 and @entity94			1
and the following year a state - run newspaper reported that @entity37 authorities had considered using armed drones to kill @entity99 , a drug lord in @entity100 who was accused of murdering 13 @entity37 sailors			1
in the end , @entity37 decided to capture @entity99 instead of launching a drone strike , but the report showed @entity37 's capacity to carry out armed drone attacks			2
meanwhile , @entity107 has also been building indigenous drone capabilities , and @entity107 authorities announced in december that they are developing an armed drone			0
in 2012 , an @entity39 military commander , @entity111			0
gen. @entity112 , disclosed details of a new long - range drone that he claimed can fly 2,000 kilometers ( about 1,250 miles ) , which puts @entity116 , @entity24 , easily in range			2
a year later , @entity39 announced it would begin mass - producing and exporting the drone , which is supposedly capable of carrying up to eight missiles .			0

@entity121 , @entity122 : drones cost a *fraction* of a fighter jet
they say drone industry will double in size in next decade
@entity24 , @entity38 , @entity37 , @entity69 are among nations developing military drones
