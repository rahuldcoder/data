from a timeless beauty ( @entity31 ) to a graceful @entity3 icon ( @entity26 ) , here are the night 's fashion winners			1
@entity31 @entity31 often chooses classic , tailored cuts , but last night she glowed in a stunning blush - toned @entity36 silk organza gown with petal - like tiers of ruffles			2
she finished off this softer look with @entity41 tassel earrings and diamond cuffs , a gold leather @entity45 clutch and dress - matching @entity36 satin sandals			2
@entity47 the ever - flawless @entity47 turned to her favorite designer @entity48 for her cream and black chiffon gown from @entity51			1
both edgy and feminine , the design featured a pleated and ruffled skirt that led into a bow - bedecked mermaid train			1

yet rather than going sexy ( down - to - there @entity36 , anyone ? ) , the diva went spectacular in a full - on princess - shaped icy pink @entity67 confection with a @entity69 crystal - studded waterfall train			2
@entity70 while still incredibly feminine , @entity70 's @entity72 gown was also most daring with its rosette - bedecked bustline			1
