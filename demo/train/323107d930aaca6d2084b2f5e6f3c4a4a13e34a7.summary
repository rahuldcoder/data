-- i believe it was the great @entity3 philosopher @entity4 , who , while meditating on the nuances of @entity6 , gave the world this piece of advice : " you got to know when to hold ' em / know when to fold ' em / know when to walk away / know when to run			1
" any @entity12 who might want to challenge a @entity14 - led effort to ban welfare recipients from spending federal aid in strip clubs and casinos needs to fold ' em. walk away			1
the @entity21 " strip club " bill just passed , 395 to 27 , with only 26 @entity23 and one @entity14 voting against it			1
but it 's not only a battle those 26 @entity23 ca n't win in the pr arena , it is a battle that completely undermines the narrative about @entity14 not caring about the middle class			1
after all , how can the opponents genuinely criticize republicans for trying to make cuts in aid while resisting a seemingly innocuous effort to avoid welfare fraud , a big concern for taxpayers ? the @entity36 -- or welfare -- supplies cash to working poor families using what amounts to a debit card			2
last year , about 1.8 million families received a few hundred federal dollars each month to help make ends meet			0
it 's meant to pay for necessities like food and rent			0
the average @entity3 can relate to that , because a lot of us have been there			2
but media reports say that some of those cards were used in atms in strip clubs , liquor stores , @entity59 casinos , even cruise ships -- locations average @entity3 can also relate to , but not with taxpayers ' money involved			1
now , just because a few people are using these cards at strip club @entity55 does not signal widespread fraud			0
in fact , less than half of 1 % of benefits in @entity68 were withdrawn in casinos and strip clubs , and it 's impossible to tell where the money was spent , according to the @entity75			1
but even still , who can be opposed to the government taking steps to discourage abuse , especially as the nation is wrestling with budget cut decisions ? i certainly did n't expect any @entity12 to be against a government regulation , given the amount of criticism the party hurls at @entity14 for deregulating everything			1
again : welfare checks , strip clubs , casinos ... seems like a no - brainer , right ? and yet rep. @entity92 , @entity93 , called the measure " another effort to berate those people who are in the lower class			1
" Â seriously @entity92 -- fold ' em. trying to massage this bill into a message about republicans demonizing the poor does n't make liberals look like fighters for the little guy			2
it makes them look like free - wheeling hedonists ; just another one of those times when some democrats may be right in the small picture , but are totally missing the big one			0
@entity112 , a senior analyst at the @entity113 , said : " this is another example of setting policies based on attention - grabbing news stories with little connection to the underlying reality and that are designed to reinforce the ' unworthy poor ' stereotype			0
" yes , this bill is a grandstanding exercise that does something close to nothing in terms of impacting the overall budget , or the very real problem with poverty			0
but so what ? the flipside is that some @entity23 look as if they do n't want to address welfare fraud while they fight welfare cuts , which , if you think about it , looks a lot worse			2
the @entity23 against this bill should fold their hand , cut their losses and live to grandstand another day			0
and as long as @entity146 and @entity147 are each within an earshot of a microphone , the chances are pretty good that there will be plenty of disconnected @entity14 remarks regarding poor people to grandstand on for the months ahead			2
does @entity155 have better things to do ? absolutely			0
but that does n't mean it should avoid doing the little things , and this is a little thing the @entity161 should pass when the bill arrives for a vote , along with testing welfare recipients and legislators for drugs			1
but @entity23 should n't just take my word on in it			0
i encourage them to walk into any manufacturing plant in the @entity171 and ask the workers how they feel about a portion of their tax dollars being spent on strippers by people on welfare			1
yeah , as i said , just fold ' em. follow @entity178 on @entity179			0
join the conversation on @entity181 the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity184 .			0

@entity14 @entity21 bill bans welfare recipients from aid in strip clubs and casinos
@entity184 : the 26 democrats who voted against @entity21 bill need to hang it up
@entity196 : only half of 1 % of benefits were withdrawn this way in @entity68 , but so what ?
@entity196 : @entity161 should pass the bill . @entity3 do n't want tax dollars spent in strip clubs
