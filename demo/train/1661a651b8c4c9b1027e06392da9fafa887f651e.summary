-- the deaths within a week of four women -- three of whom had advertised in an adult personals section of a website -- are being treated as the work of one person or group of people , @entity2 's police chief said tuesday			1
" at this point , we are working it as one case or one suspect or set of suspects , " chief @entity13 told @entity0			2
" there are too many common links for us not to , at this point , work this as one single investigation			1
" among those links , he said , is the fact that three of the women had placed online ads dealing with " prearranged adult dating services " and posted on @entity34 , @entity13 told reporters monday			1
" we felt it is imperative to alert the public that deciding to meet unknown persons via the @entity38 can be extremely dangerous , " @entity13 said			2
but a lawyer for backpage.com , @entity41 , said it was not clear that his company 's website was involved			2
" our team has already provided the police with detailed information about the ads that the suspect or others posted on numerous web sites			2
law enforcement authorities now have evidence that the investigation appears to connect to at least 30 different ads or other postings on at least 15 different websites , separate and distinct from ours , " @entity41 said			1
" we are not aware of the existence of any evidence that would indicate which of these many sites were used by the suspect to establish contact with his victims			0
" the most recent deaths were discovered early sunday , when police found the bodies of two women , burned beyond recognition , in the trunk of a burning car			1
the victims have been tentatively identified and are believed to be 28 and 29 years of age , @entity13 said			0
neither body showed obvious signs of trauma , he said			0
six days earlier , on december 19 , the bodies of two other women were found in the trunk of a car parked at a vacant dwelling , @entity2 police said			1
while autopsy results , including toxicology tests , are not complete , " we are proceeding as if this is two murder scenes , " he said			0
@entity34 representatives have been cooperating with police , who plan to get search warrants and trace computer internet protocol addresses and cell phone numbers in an attempt " to start putting this puzzle together , " the police chief said			1
postings on the escort section of the website cost $ 1			0
referring to the advertisements on the website as " borderline prostitution , " @entity13 said that his priorities lie elsewhere			0
" right now , we want to get to the bottom of how these four individuals passed away , and who had a hand in their demise , " he said			0
