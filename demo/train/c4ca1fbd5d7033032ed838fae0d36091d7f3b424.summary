-- this week , the @entity1 made a decision that sent shock waves around the world			0
the governmental agency banned the importation of @entity8 's older @entity7 ( before the @entity9 ) and cellular @entity10 ( before the third - generation @entity11 ) into the @entity13 market			1
these devices were found to violate a @entity16 patent necessary to connect with @entity18 's cellular network			1
simply put , if you 're an @entity18 customer , your phone is not a phone without a technology that @entity16 owns			2
customs officers will hold any @entity8 shipments coming from @entity25 in 60 days if they contain those older products unless an appeals court sides with @entity8 or president @entity28 vetoes the order			1
the president has delegated this decision - making power to the @entity13 trade representative , but obviously , he can still do what no @entity13 president has done in decades			1
however , he should n't get mired in this particular battle			2
a veto would be consistent with a set of patent reform proposals the @entity39 unveiled a few hours before the @entity1 's decision , which would make it harder to obtain such bans			2
but it would mean depriving @entity16 of its most significant victory in a bitter legal spat with @entity8 and interfere in the intense two - horse race going on in the smartphone market			1
a veto would also snub a major @entity13 trading partner and geopolitical ally : @entity51 , where @entity16 accounts for about a fifth of the national economy			1
the @entity51 would certainly cry foul over " protectionism			0
" the good news for @entity8 is that most of the affected products are no longer on sale			2
the ones that are still being sold are @entity8 's lowest - priced entry - level offerings			2
as soon as @entity8 launches the @entity60 , the @entity61 will replace the @entity9 as the mid-priced product			0
the @entity9 , which is also safe , will then become the low - end @entity61			0
until this happens , we 're talking about 1 % of @entity8 's sales -- less , actually , because @entity18 can buy as many @entity67 and @entity11 2 units over the next 60 days as it wants and sell them afterward			2
and customers still have different models from which to choose			0
but there 's a bigger reason for concern			0
what @entity16 dropped on those older @entity8 products is the patent equivalent of a nuclear bomb , and a @entity13 government agency with court - like powers said : " yes , @entity16 , you 're in your right to use this lethal weapon , and we do n't care that @entity8 claims it 's been universally outlawed			1
" next time someone -- not necessarily @entity16 , which could even find itself on the receiving end -- will use patents of this kind , called standard - essential patents , to nuke products that jobs depend on and that customers will sorely miss. and next time could be a matter of months because various other @entity1 cases over standard - essential patents are pending and will come to judgment soon			1
that 's the real concern			0
why are standard - essential patents the equivalent of a nuclear weapon ? because there are industry standards that establish the use of certain techniques			1
unless your phone and mine use the same standard , we ca n't give each other a call or send each other a photo because the devices we use wo n't understand each other			0
this is called interoperability -- working together			0
when companies get together and define a standard , they have to promise to use these patents only as parking meters , not as guns			0
conventional patents , such as the ones @entity8 is suing @entity16 over , do n't raise the same issues			1
for example , @entity8 is suing @entity16 over a feature called " rubber - banding			1
" it 's the iconic bounce - back effect when you scroll a list ( such as your phone 's address book ) and reach the end			0
i like it , but if you have rubber - banding and i do n't , we can still keep in touch			0
@entity142 should work with the president and denuclearize the mobile patents wars by disallowing import bans over standard - essential patents			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity149 .			0

@entity13 government agency gave @entity16 a victory over @entity8 in patent *dispute*
@entity149 : president @entity28 can veto the ruling , but he should n't get mired in it
he says what 's really at state are standard - essential patents
@entity149 : @entity142 can abate mobile patents wars by disallowing bans over @entity166
