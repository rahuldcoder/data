-- @entity2 officials and opposition activists blamed each other for an attack on a gas pipeline near the restive city of @entity8 on tuesday , while opposition groups said more than 30 people had died in new clashes			1
the @entity13 - based @entity12 said three civilians were killed by government troops in @entity8 , while deserting government troops killed 18 members of the security forces in the city of @entity20			1
@entity2 officials did not respond to @entity0 requests for comment on the incident , and state media did not mention it			2
and the @entity27 , an opposition umbrella group , said police and troops still loyal to president @entity31 's government killed 11 people in and around @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity8 , where the state - run @entity35 blamed the pipeline explosion on a " terrorist group			1
" @entity0 can not independently confirm events inside @entity2 because the government restricts the activity of journalists			1
but activists in @entity8 said the government blew up the pipeline itself to distract @entity48 monitors , who are in the country to try to protect civilians from violence at the hands of government security forces			1
" the regime did that intentionally			0
they do n't care about @entity8 ; what difference does it make to them to have no power ? we do n't have any of the necessities : medication , heating fuel , food			0
and garbage is everywhere , " said one activist			0
another activist in the city of @entity34 said the @entity48 monitors there were surrounded by @entity2 officials and security forces , making it difficult for locals to speak to the observers freely			1
the activist said the city still has many checkpoints and security forces with heavy machine guns , and that tanks have not been withdrawn from the city -- just hidden where monitors can not see them			0
the activists spoke to @entity0 by @entity85 from @entity2			2
@entity0 is not naming them to protect their safety			0
top @entity88 and @entity89 officials also expressed doubts about whether @entity2 was abiding by its november agreement with the @entity48 , which calls for the release of protesters jailed by the months - long crackdown on anti-government demonstrations and the withdrawal of @entity2 troops from cities			1
@entity100 spokesman @entity99 said @entity33 was clearly breaking its deal with its fellow @entity103 states			2
" across the country , the @entity2 people continue to suffer at the hand of the @entity31 regime , as indiscriminate killing of scores of civilians continues , " @entity99 said			2
he said it was " past time " for the @entity112 to take action , and said @entity114 was working with its allies " to increase the pressure on the @entity31 regime			2
" and @entity118 spokeswoman @entity117 said that while some prisoners have been freed , the releases are " nothing like what the @entity2 government promised to the @entity48			1
" " our concern is that the @entity48 monitors , although they are providing some ability for some demonstrators to express their views in some places , they have not led to the full implementation of the commitments that the @entity31 regime took on , " @entity117 told reporters in @entity114			1
meanwhile , she urged @entity2 opposition forces to avoid attacks that would play into the government 's hands			1
" that 's exactly what the regime wants , is to make @entity2 more violent and have an excuse to retaliate itself , " @entity117 said			1
in @entity142 , @entity89 foreign minister @entity141 told @entity89 's @entity143 on tuesday that he was " a little skeptical " about whether the monitors are getting free access to the facts			1
" we await their report that will be carried out in the coming days , " @entity141 said			2
but he added , " i do not consider the battle already lost			0
" " the secretary - general of the @entity48 has expressed the will to get to the bottom of this investigation , " he said			0
" the truth must be established , and the regime can not poison the observers who are on the ground			0
" @entity89 president @entity159 said tuesday that president @entity31 must relinquish power , saying the " massacres " by his forces " evoke disgust and revolt in the @entity103 world , in @entity89 , in @entity164 and everywhere in the world			2
" @entity159 said nations must continue " unrelentingly denouncing a barbaric repression and ensuring that the observers from the @entity103 league have the means and the freedom to carry out their work correctly			0
" @entity48 secretary - general @entity175 is scheduled to discuss the monitoring team 's preliminary report on saturday , an official with the organization told @entity0 on condition of anonymity			1
@entity182 is scheduled to meet with the head of the @entity103 @entity184 on wednesday , said the official , who is not authorized to speak to the press and asked not to be named			0
@entity182 said monday that the killing was still going on despite the presence of his observers			0
" there is still gunfire , there are still snipers , and we hope that all that will disappear , " he said in @entity189 , adding : " there is gunfire from various directions , which makes it hard to tell who is shooting			0
there is no doubt that killing is ongoing , but i ca n't pinpoint the numbers			0
" @entity48 observers entered @entity2 last week after the @entity205 estimated that 5,000 people had been killed since march in an uprising against the government			1
@entity210 's government says it is cracking down on armed terrorists			0
the @entity48 aims " to provide protection to @entity2 civilians , " @entity175 said monday , adding that it was asking for a cease - fire and for the names of detainees in @entity2 prisons			1
nearly 3,500 prisoners have been freed , he said			0
the @entity48 has placed more than 70 monitors in six cities , and the number of observers soon will exceed 100 , @entity175 said			2
@entity0 's @entity224 , @entity225 , @entity226 , @entity227 and @entity228 contributed to this report .			0
