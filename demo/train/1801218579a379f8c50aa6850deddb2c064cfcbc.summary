-- @entity1 accused @entity2 of firing rockets into the @entity5 suburb of @entity6 on sunday , striking a " scientific research center , " @entity1 state tv reported			1
it is the second @entity1 claim this year of a strike against what observers have described as a government defense research facility , and it comes one day after @entity15 officials first told @entity0 that the @entity15 believes @entity2 carried out an airstrike against @entity1			1
@entity17 declined to comment on the @entity1 tv report			1
" we do not comment on these reports at all , " an @entity17 spokesperson said			1
the @entity1 news report claimed the rocket attack on the research center aided rebels , who have been battling government forces in the region			1
in late january , reports surfaced that @entity2 warplanes targeted the research facility			1
the @entity1 government has said the airstrike killed two workers and injured five others			2
a @entity15 official told @entity0 at the time the @entity1 claims were false			1
the official said @entity2 fighter jets targeted a @entity1 government convoy carrying surface - to - air missiles bound for the militant group @entity40 in @entity41			1
@entity1 denied there were such shipments			2
the report of rocket attacks come as sectarian violence erupted in northwestern @entity1 , where three consecutive days of killing by mostly @entity49 forces have left hundreds of predominantly @entity51 residents dead , opposition groups said saturday			1
" the regime attacked the town of @entity57 and other neighboring areas from the sea with rockets before security forces and militias loyal to the regime entered the area and conducted mass executions , " @entity66 chief of staff gen. @entity67 said by phone from @entity53 , @entity54			1
" they want to establish a sectarian - based entity in the region , " he said			2
state media have said their forces were seeking only to clear the area of " terrorists , " the term they have routinely used when referring to rebel forces			1
but the @entity80 said it was " appalled by horrific reports that more than 100 people were killed may 2 " in @entity83 , a suburb of @entity84			1
" we call on all responsible actors in @entity1 to speak out against the perpetration of unlawful killings against any group , regardless of faith or ethnicity , " spokeswoman @entity85 said in a statement			2
opposition groups that included the @entity95 , the @entity96 and the @entity66 said the widespread killing in and around the coastal city of @entity84 continued saturday as largely @entity49 regime forces used tanks , battleships and missile launchers to hit largely @entity51 neighborhoods in @entity84			2
the government forces killed at least 200 people on friday and saturday in @entity84 and its suburbs , the @entity95 said saturday			2
more than 200 others were killed there on thursday , when the killings started early in the day , it said			2
reliable information has been difficult to obtain because government forces controlled access to the village , the @entity95 said			2
the @entity96 said hundreds of @entity51 families began fleeing @entity84 ' southern neighborhoods at dawn saturday , heading toward the cities of @entity119 and @entity120			0
a graphic video posted by activists who said it was shot in the @entity125 neighborhood showed people , including an infant , lying lifeless on the ground			0
many bore what appeared to be bullet wounds and some appeared burned			0
@entity0 's access to war zones has been limited by the government and has not been able to confirm its authenticity			0
state - run @entity1 tv filed reports from @entity57 over the last two days reporting that government troops along with the @entity142 militia , an armed @entity141 loyal to the government , " have cleaned the area from armed terrorists " after " they burned civilians ' homes and stores and terrorized the population			1
" the reporting was supported by interviews with members of the @entity1 army			0
@entity154 has warned of sectarian violence last december , the @entity154 @entity156 warned that the civil war had become " overtly sectarian			0
" it said government forces and militias , dominated by @entity49 , had been attacking @entity51 -- who were " broadly ( but not uniformly ) " backing the rebel groups			0
and anti-government armed groups were targeting @entity49			0
other minority communities , including some @entity170 , @entity171 , @entity172 , @entity173 and @entity174 , " have also been caught up in the conflict , and in some cases forced to take up arms for their own defense or to take sides			0
" but it said the " sectarian lines fall most sharply " between @entity49 and @entity51			0
the " increasingly sectarian nature " of the fighting is a motivator for proxy groups fighting in @entity1			0
anti-government armed groups are composed of @entity51 from the @entity182 and @entity183 , the report said			1
shiites from other countries have entered the conflict on behalf of @entity1			0
the @entity41 @entity188 group @entity40 has said its members are fighting			0
there are reports of @entity193 shiites fighting in @entity1 and of @entity195 's @entity194 providing intellectual and advisory support			2
christian communities across @entity1 have been under the gun and on the move			0
@entity201 , for example , was once home to 80,000 @entity170 , but the commission said most had escaped to @entity41			0
" with communities believing -- not without cause -- that they face an existential threat , the need for a negotiated settlement is more urgent than ever , " the commission said			0
@entity211 makes public appearance also saturday , the country 's president made his second public appearance this month , according to state - run @entity1 television			1
" president @entity218 joins thousands of students and families of martyrs in @entity222 in inaugurating the @entity223 in memory of all the students who were killed in @entity1 , " it said			0
the president 's facebook page posted a picture of the event			0
on may 1 , @entity218 visited the @entity233 electrical plant to " congratulate its staff and all the @entity1 workers on the occasion of @entity237 , " the state - run @entity230 reported			0
@entity2 said to be flying over @entity41 @entity2 was flying warplanes over @entity41 on thursday , friday and saturday , the @entity41 army said			1
@entity41 's president , gen. @entity242 , condemned the violations as " an attempt to shaken @entity41 stability , " the state - run @entity240 reported saturday			0
the @entity2 military had no comment			1
but a source in the @entity2 defense establishment told @entity0 's @entity250 , " we will do whatever is necessary to stop the transfer of weapons from @entity1 to terrorist organizations			1
we have done it in the past and we will do it if necessary the future			0
" @entity2 appears to have struck @entity1 two @entity15 officials told @entity0 on friday that @entity2 appears to have conducted an airstrike into @entity1 on thursday or friday			1
based on initial indications , the @entity15 does not believe @entity2 warplanes entered @entity1 airspace to conduct the strikes			1
president @entity266 told reporters on friday that he did not foresee a scenario of " @entity15 boots on the ground in @entity1 " that would be good for that country or the region			1
@entity266 said other leaders in the region want to see @entity218 out of power			0
