president @entity0 took veiled shots at governors who are mandating quarantines for health workers returning to the @entity5 after treating @entity7 patients tuesday			1
but the military -- where the @entity9 has already imposed similar quarantines -- is " a different situation , " @entity0 said tuesday			1
without mentioning them by name , @entity0 criticized @entity15 gov. @entity14 , @entity17 gov. @entity16 and others for the quarantines they 've imposed for health workers , saying they " are n't based on science and best practices " and calling them " another barrier on somebody who 's already doing really important work on our behalf			1
" @entity14 , though , pointed to the discrepancy between how health workers and military members are being treated as he defended himself in an @entity35 interview tuesday morning			1
" now six other states have joined us as well , both @entity38 and @entity39 governors			0
as has the @entity5 military , " @entity14 said			2
@entity0 , though , said he has no problem with members of the military facing different policies than the general public because their service in @entity50 , at the epicenter of the @entity7 outbreak , is n't voluntary			2
" it 's part of their mission that 's been assigned to them by their commanders and ultimately by me , the commander - in - chief , " he told reporters on the @entity53 's @entity52 on tuesday			0
@entity0 to officials : do n't react out of ' fears ' of @entity7 " so we do n't expect to have similar rules for our military as we do for civilians , " @entity0 said			1
" they are already , by definition , if they 're in the military under more circumscribed conditions			0
" meanwhile , the @entity73 is preparing to announce new policies on whether military members returning from @entity7 - related assignments will be monitored or have their travel restricted			0
@entity78 , the undersecretary of @entity79 for personnel and readiness , issued an oct. 10 memo that said troops who have faced an elevated risk of exposure to @entity7 will be quarantined for 21 days -- and that those who have n't faced any known exposure will be monitored for three weeks			0
since then , the @entity9 has announced quarantines for all members who return from @entity50			0
a @entity73 spokeswoman said tuesday that defense secretary @entity90 is reviewing the @entity9 's move and " will have a decision soon " on whether it will be extended to other branches of the military			2
