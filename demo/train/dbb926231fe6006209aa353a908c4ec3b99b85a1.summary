-- when april @entity3 locked eyes with a handsome stranger on her flight out of @entity7 last @entity8 , her heart skipped a beat			2
so she did what any hip 21st - century single would do : she posted an ad on @entity15 's " missed connections " bulletin board when she got home			1
a " missed connection " ad led to the marriage of @entity21 and @entity22 who welcomed son @entity23 two years later			1
" he replied within two hours , " says @entity3 , a 29 - year - old sales associate and musician from @entity25			2
" we e-mailed back and forth and realized we had a lot of mutual friends			2
i thought , ' wow , this is meant to be			0
' " it was n't			0
@entity3 and her missed - connection match went out a few times , but then he bowed out , citing relationship butterflies			0
three weeks later , however , a mutual friend told @entity3 the guy was seeing someone else			0
but he apparently was still smitten with the story of how he and @entity3 met			0
" i was at a wedding and this girl came up to me and says , ' are you that april who dated so - and - so last winter ? i just love your story -- it 's so romantic , ' " says @entity3			1
" for me , that 's the kind of story you tell if you 're still together			0
" @entity48 to be ' missed ' @entity15 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 -- these missed - opportunity matchmakers have become a staple of online modern love			1
they 've also become a way for some singles to fantasize about the people they 'd like to meet and those they hope will want to meet them			0
" i love reading those missed - connections ads. everyone does , " says @entity61 , a 22 - year - old gallery assistant from @entity62			1
" and i 've always had this hope in the back of my mind that someone would ' miss ' me			1
" @entity61 's wish came true in february after a chance encounter with a handsome graphic designer named @entity71 at the grocery store , when they both reached for the same carton of orange juice			0
at home a few hours later , @entity76 , an avid reader of @entity15 's missed connections , surfed over to the site and got the surprise of her life : " beautiful girl in the sambas at @entity85 's - m4w - 23 ( @entity86 )			1
" " when i saw @entity71 's ad , i started screaming , ' i 'm the brunette in the ( @entity89 ) @entity88 ! ' " @entity61 says			1
the two have been dating ever since			0
desperately seeking someone @entity92 , a documentary filmmaker in @entity62 , is n't surprised by the appeal of the missed connection			1
she 's been working on a film about the phenomenon for 10 months			0
" what inspires me about these ads is the density of the narrative , " says @entity97 , 30 , who 's read and responded to hundreds of @entity15 postings since beginning work on the film			1
" the longing , the romance -- all in this small space			1
" some of the stories @entity97 has collected are heart - wrenching -- like the @entity111 man who spent five hours talking with a woman in a @entity62 bar , realized she was the " love of his life , " then left without getting her number			1
others , like the woman whose online flirt turned out to be married , are cynical reminders of how elusive true connections can be			1
most ads come from commuters afraid to talk to someone on the subway out of shyness , says @entity97			1
other chance encounters occur at big - box stores like @entity130			1
" there 's one elevator in the @entity130 on @entity134 in @entity135 that seems to be a real hot spot for romance , " she says			1
" if i were single , i 'd ride that elevator up and down			2
" redefining the pickup line the appeal of missed - connection web sites may indicate a shift in how people approach the search for love			1
one woman @entity97 interviewed told her of a flirtatious encounter with a guy at a pizza parlor			2
rather than give the guy her number , @entity97 says , " she said to herself , ' i 'll just find him later on the @entity151			0
' five years or even two years ago , you would n't have thought you could find a stranger on the @entity151			0
but that possibility exists now			0
" that 's not necessarily a good thing , says @entity158 , director of the @entity159 and author of " the @entity161 : a bold guide to @entity163 for the @entity164			0
" " we have so much technology , all these ways of communicating that are n't face to face , it 's intensified our fear of direct communication , " she says			0
" it 's always scary to say hello to a stranger , but going to the internet just keeps the hesitation going			0
" happily ever after ? but missed connections are n't just about being too shy to approach a potential love interest or reaching for the unattainable out of fear of commitment			2
sometimes , they 're simply about losing the object of your attraction in a crowd			0
@entity186 , a 31 - year - old architect from @entity187 , says he was disappointed when he could n't find @entity22 , the " cool girl with the magnetic personality " he 'd chatted with at a concert on september 4 , 2006			1
but he was delighted when he saw her @entity15 posting the next day			1
" a lot of those ads seem to be from guys and girls who ca n't work up the courage to ask the person out , " he says			2
" but in the case with @entity22 , it was a true missed connection			0
" @entity22 and @entity199 , a 26 - year - old marketing manager , went on a date three weeks after she posted the ad			2
their story has a true -- and traditional -- happy ending			0
" it 's really unbelievable to think how one little item like an internet posting has changed my life , " says @entity22			0
" but a couple of years later , i 'm happily married and have a great son			2
i really do owe a lot to @entity15			1
" @entity0 provides original and syndicated lifestyle content to web publishers			2
@entity212 is the author of " how to date in a @entity216 " and writes a column , @entity214 , for the @entity215 .			0
