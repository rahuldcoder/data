@entity0 -- pick up a television remote control in your @entity4 , @entity5 , hotel room today and you are guaranteed to find a program to teach you how to play craps , blackjack and roulette as well as be inundated with 30 - second messages about who to vote for in the nov. 2 election			2
wait , who to vote for ? that 's correct			0
the television airwaves in @entity4 are so saturated with political tv commercials that in the past week alone , these ads took up 180,600 seconds or 3,010 minutes , according to a new analysis of tv ads for @entity1 by @entity21			1
to boil it down into a more recognizable number , more than 50 hours was dedicated to tv commercials on @entity4 stations in the last seven days , said @entity26 , @entity21 's president and @entity1 's consultant on tv advertising			1
an astonishing figure , yes , but when you pause it suddenly makes sense			0
after all , the battle for control of @entity34 is being waged in this western state where @entity37 majority leader @entity36 is fighting for his political life and @entity39 have a very good shot of defeating a @entity42 incumbent in its march to try and retake the @entity46 majority			1
add in the race for governor and other state offices and the airwaves quickly become cluttered with political tv commercials			1
and @entity51 noted that seven in 10 commercials currently running on @entity4 airwaves are negative			2
what is happening in @entity4 is playing out in cities across the country such as @entity57 , @entity58 ; @entity59 and @entity60 , @entity61 ; @entity62 , @entity63 ; @entity64 , @entity65 ; and @entity66 and @entity67 , @entity68			2

" this is crunch time for politicians as they start to try and reach the all important independent and late deciding voters who will determine the outcomes of close races , " @entity51 said			0
" even though most voters are locked in for one candidate there are still a significant percentage of people just tuning in and deciding who to vote for			0
" but does this saturation help ? wo n't voters turn off and tune out ? maybe so , but you still have to have skin in the game			0
" even though there is tremendous waste in this on return for investment , it is right now influencing the undecided voters who will decide these close elections , " @entity51 contended			0
" politics is still the only business that spends the most amount of money and has the least amount of people to influence			0
" a snapshot of all television advertising in the past week shows that $ 40 million was spent on @entity37 races , while more than $ 46.6 million was dedicated to @entity46 races			1
in the @entity37 , republicans spent about $ 4 million more than @entity42 , thanks to ads run by outside interest groups			1
meanwhile , the @entity39 spent more than $ 2 million more than @entity42 in the battle for the @entity46 , also due to spending by outside groups			1
now , to really give you an even bigger mind - boggling figure : $ 182 million was spent on television ads for federal , local and state races combined in the past week			1
this was a 17 percent increase from the prior week			0
and if that does n't surprise you , check this out : @entity51 predicts that by year 's end -- the final spending figure for all political and issue tv advertising in the 2010 midterm elections will exceed $ 3 billion			1
just in time for the start of the 2012 presidential race			0
