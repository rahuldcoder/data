@entity0 , @entity1 -- to understand the full beauty of the ancient @entity5 city of @entity6 you have to come to wintry , cold @entity1			1
in the east @entity1 city of @entity0 , artist @entity8 has designed a panoramic scene of epic proportions , breathing life into a long - forgotten view of the @entity15 capital			1
using a detailed and much - praised painting by @entity17 and @entity18 from 1886 as his inspiration , @entity8 painted a first draft of @entity6 's cityscape in 1994			1
nearly 17 years later , an even more impressive version has gone on display ; it will remain in @entity0 only until september -- a deliberate decision by the artist			1
" to me art is a constant process			0
i always want to improve my panoramic scenes , " @entity8 told @entity2			2
his 360 degree view of @entity6 in 312 ad is 27 meters high , 107 meters long and weighs 750 kilograms -- making it one of the world 's largest panoramic scenes			1
visitors overlook the city from a 15 meter high metallic tower located in the center of the perfectly circular museum : standing on top of the tower , viewers feel they are part of @entity6 -- though sadly unable to wander down the stairs and walk to the @entity43			1
@entity8 chose as his subject a historical moment , the influence of which is still felt in @entity48 and around the world today : the triumphal procession of the @entity51 on october 29 , 312			2
@entity51 's brutal success over his rivals marked the beginning of the @entity55			0
at that time @entity6 was vital to @entity48 , and the days when many of its magnificent buildings would lie in ruins were a long way off			1
" moments that have shaped our world have a huge impact on my art " , said @entity8 , sitting in his large @entity62 studio , its walls filled with his paintings and photographs of ancient buildings or old reliefs			1
" but this panoramic scene is not really about showing a cityscape , it is more about the stories hidden within the city , " @entity8 said			2
the panorama is a museum that needs no words to tell its stories			0
an art form dating back to 19th century @entity48 , panoramas fell out of fashion with the coming of the cinema			0
but why are people so fascinated ? " it seems @entity8 's artistically and archaeologically - underpinned reconstruction of an ancient cityscape fills a large audience with enthusiasm for panoramic scenes and classical antiquity even today , " said @entity88 , director of @entity62 's antiquities collection			1
@entity8 has created a second historic panorama showing the ancient @entity99 city of @entity100 ( today located in @entity101 ) , which is currently on show at @entity104 's @entity103 , on the @entity105 in @entity62			1
@entity8 has been working on super-sized 360 degree panoramas since 1994			1
it takes him at least a year to design a single work , with previous subjects including @entity110 and rainforests			1
" over the years the way panoramas were made has changed dramatically			0
i love to design on the computer as well as painting in the traditional way " , @entity8 said			2
today music samples , lighting and special effects are used to increase the impact of the panoramas , which change throughout the day , allowing visitors to see them by daylight or night			1
@entity8 has formed a symbiotic relationship between science and art : to him research is as important as artistic know - how			2
" i do n't know whether my work is art or science			0
probably it is both : art starts where science stops , " he said			0
his passion for details has taken him to @entity6 countless times -- and visitors ' reactions suggest all that study has been worth the effort			2
" this panorama is fascinating , " said @entity140 , 32 , from @entity62			1
" i have read about the beautiful roman buildings lots of times before			0
but only now i understand why			0
" " it is amazing to see how they go out of the museum , " @entity8 said			0
" lots of them are touched by the painting			0
" i hope that the emotional connection between the panorama and the visitor will change their relationship with their environment			0
" having grown up in the former @entity155 ( @entity155 ) some of his art focuses on social issues			0
he is planning a panorama of the @entity159 , but says that rather than examining the cruelties of the @entity155 regime , it will instead focus on a normal day in the once - split @entity62			2
" to me it is extremely interesting why so many people in the former @entity155 did accept to live in such a country , " he said			0
" many people - including me			0
" meanwhile his panoramas are exciting more and more interest overseas			0
in 2003 , @entity8 drew a panorama for @entity170 which showed the architect 's plans for the @entity174 site in @entity175			2
@entity170 won the tendering process , and his design is currently under construction			0
it was @entity8 's first panorama to not only fake reality - but create it			1
" and there is much more to come , " @entity8 said			0
@entity182 's @entity6 312 : experience the @entity183 is on display in @entity0 until september 2 , 2012			1
@entity100 : @entity186 of the @entity183 is on view in @entity62 until september 30 , 2012 .			1
