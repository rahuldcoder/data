the comment on the @entity2 page of the @entity4 tabloid newspaper @entity3 last july was unequivocal			1
" the death penalty is the only just sentence in this case ! ! ! ! ! ! " it said			0
written by @entity9 , the " case " to which the message referred was the meticulously planned mass murder of 77 people in @entity15 on july 22 , 2011by @entity16			1
this week , the @entity16 case has finally come to @entity15 central criminal court			1
but @entity9 , who , as it happens , had been selected as a " lay " judge ( the @entity4 version of the @entity23 and @entity24 jury system ) , was n't in court			2
he had been dismissed for his @entity2 comment which the case 's presiding judge , @entity27 , suggested could " weaken trust in his impartiality			2
" strangely enough , even @entity16 , who posted his murderous intentions on his own @entity2 page just before the july rampage , might have agreed with @entity9 's @entity2 comment			1
speaking in court yesterday , @entity16 admitted : " there are only two just and fair outcomes of this case			2
one is an acquittal , the other is capital punishment			0
" @entity16 's bizarre comment captures the baffling nature of a case that has so far lurched from the grotesque public confessional of a mass murderer to the equally tasteless spectacle of a hatemonger whose racist delusions seem to have been fed , in part at least , by the @entity53			1
indeed , virtual networks like @entity2 , @entity55 , @entity56 and the @entity57 seem to offer as good clues as any to why this 32 year - old man should decide one day to blow up and shoot as many fellow @entity4 as he could			1
@entity16 may or may not be found to be clinically insane			2
but beneath or beside his madness , there 's something about @entity16 which captures , in extremis , the increasingly delusional , violent and narcissistic nature of our digital culture			1
it would , of course , be crass to blame something as tragic as the mass murder of 77 innocent @entity4 on social media			1
and yet it would be equally irresponsible to simply ignore these signs and refuse to draw any connection at all between @entity16 's troubled personality and the broader culture forces in our electronically networked world			1
firstly , there 's his self - evidently narcissistic personality which has enabled him to stand in an @entity15 court this week and unselfconsciously boast about what he called " the most sophisticated and spectacular political attack in @entity84 since @entity85 " it was this same narcissism , of course , that also generated his 1,500 page " @entity91 " as well as his prolific postings on social media sites like @entity2 and @entity55			1
@entity92 , of course , was n't invented by the @entity53 and it would be absurd to establish a causal connection between self - love and mass murder			0
that said , however , today 's digital media culture -- which shatters the 20th century mass audience into billions of 21st century authors and enables them all to broadcast their most intimate thoughts to the world -- seems to be making narcissism the default mode of contemporary existence			1
as @entity109 notes in an excellent @entity111 cover story this month about @entity2 : " rising narcissism is n't so much a trend as the trend behind all other trends			1
" social networks like @entity2 are making us lonely , @entity109 concludes			1
the more connected we think we are on social media " communities , " he argues , the more isolated and atomized we really are becoming			0
and if there 's one self - evident thing on show this week in @entity15 's central court , it is the loneliness of being @entity16			2
" july 22 was n't about me			0
july 22 was a suicide attack			0
i was n't expecting to survive that day			0
a narcissist would never have given his life for anyone or anything , " @entity16 said this week in court			2
but the crime , this me - terrorism , was all about him			0
he can talk all he likes about his association with obscure racist groups like the @entity136 , but the truth is that @entity16 is totally alone			2
no friends , no fellow conspirators , no girlfriend , no loved ones			0
even his father had n't spoken to him for years			0
then there 's @entity16 's reliance on the @entity53 to learn about the world -- a world that he sees in the stark @entity148 terms of evil @entity149 and communists versus good @entity4 @entity151			1
when asked this week about the greatest influence on his ideology , @entity16 's answer was simple			2
" @entity56 " , he said			0
that 's what most informed his bizarre worldview			0
perhaps part of the narcissist 's affection for @entity56 lies in its over 10,000 word article about him , an entry that describes him as a " terrorist , " includes 200 footnotes and is almost as detailed as the @entity56 entries on @entity166 or @entity167			0
indeed , given the " open " nature of the @entity56 editorial system , who is to say that the self - obsessed @entity16 himself has n't been contributing to his own entry ? most troubling of all is @entity16 's obsession with the multiplayer role - playing @entity57 , a violent online game that he played " full - time " between 2006 and 2007			1
indeed , one of the few times that he smiled this week was when the image of his @entity57 character was displayed in court			0
some apologists for video games have suggested that @entity16 's addiction to @entity57 " means nothing at all			1
" but they are wrong			0
given his absolute absence of remorse over the murders , it 's not hard to imagine that this obsession with violent online games has enabled him to somehow virtualize the killing of real people , transforming them from flesh and blood characters into abstractions			1
i have to agree with @entity9			0
the death penalty is , indeed , the only just sentence in the @entity16 case			2
that said , however , this case is n't just about a single delusional character			0
@entity16 's obsession with violent online games , his narcissism , his reliance on @entity56 and @entity2 are warnings about how digital media can corrupt our grasp of reality			1
@entity16 may be a worst case scenario , but i fear that there will be more young men like him in future if virtual reality becomes our only reality .			0
