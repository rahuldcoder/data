it 's a phenomenon well known to generations of rock bands , elevated from relative obscurity at home to apparent god - like status in the @entity9 @entity12 at the airport by screaming fans , groups struggling to get in their own charts get an unexpected -- and often career - reviving -- taste of @entity16 , @entity17 - style			1
this weekend , it 's going international -- " @entity19 " on tour , in @entity21			2
thousands of enthusiastic @entity9 will invade @entity22 for an event that some say has become the crowning jewel in a new national obsession			1
it 's not pop music , but horse racing -- a sport that has emerged from a murky association with underworld gambling to become an aspirational pastime for a younger generation of @entity9 racegoers and a rival to the likes of baseball and football			1
" many years ago , horse racing had a kind of bad reputation but there has been a big change in perception among @entity9 citizens , " @entity40 , the @entity22 representative for the @entity41 , told @entity0			1
" it is true that horse racing still offers betting but it is loved by many people as a sport , which they could be enthusiastic about			1
" a party of some 5,000 horse - racing - mad fans is traveling to the @entity56 capital to see if their nation can finally end its hoodoo in one of the sport 's premier events -- the @entity62			1
the passion and desire to win @entity67 racing 's richest prize -- with a purse of â ‚ ¬ 4 million ( $ 5.4 million ) -- is almost verging on an obsession , but it is an obsession with good reason			1
@entity9 has come agonizingly close to winning the big prize at @entity21 on numerous occasions			1
the most recent attempt was @entity74 , who last year had been a frontrunner only to be upstaged by the unfancied @entity75			0
one of @entity9 's most famous horses , @entity77 , was backed at 1 - 2 to win in 2006 only to falter rather dramatically , while three years later @entity78 had boasted a lead of five lengths but was beaten on the line by @entity82			1
@entity86 is effectively the jewel missing in the crown of @entity9 racing , the likes of the @entity84 and @entity85 already conquered long ago , and it is an event that will be watched on television by some 30 million people in @entity9 alone , nearly a quarter of its entire population			1
@entity40 , however , insists his nation 's love of the race is " not an obsession			1
" " it 's just it is the most famous and desirable overseas race in my country and a lot of @entity9 people and the horse connections have a great ambition to win the race , " he said			1
" the @entity9 have made a lot of efforts to catch up with @entity67 and @entity110 racehorses for more than 50 years since the first overseas challenge in 1958 , and one of the goals is to win the @entity62			1
" @entity9 , as has been the custom in recent years , can aspire to victory this year			1
last month , @entity74 won the @entity118 at @entity21 for a second successive year and and is top of many bookmakers ' odds lists for sunday			2
fellow contender @entity122 , sired by @entity77 , triumphed over in another @entity124 race , the @entity125 on the @entity127 distance of one - and - a - half miles at the same venue			1
for the @entity9 punters , backing their own horses is a source of nationalistic pride			1
they betted so heavily on @entity77 that the seven - time @entity137 winner was an overwhelming favorite at the @entity127			1
" i heard they had bets of about â ‚ ¬ 500 each on @entity77 and , had it won , the story goes they would n't have even cashed it in as they wanted to keep the memento , " says @entity139 , who has enjoyed more success than most as a foreign trainer on @entity9 soil			2
the @entity151 is best known for @entity152 , which in 2010 and 2011 enjoyed back - to - back victories in the @entity154 in @entity155 , and his family has long been interlinked with @entity9 -- his father @entity157 was among the first foreign trainers to be invited over			1
@entity159 says the obsession with horse racing in @entity9 is not solely the reserve of the @entity127 , with passion as fervent -- in fact , even more so -- for its domestic races			1
" it 's enormous compared to what we 're used to , " he explains			2
" horses have huge followings and jockeys too			0
you 'll see posters of them out there , which you 'd never see in the @entity177 for a second			0
at the @entity180 ( the biggest race on the calendar ) , there 's 100,000 people there			2
the atmosphere is like nothing i 've heard before			0
the noise is genuinely unbelievable			0
" it is a sentiment echoed by jockey @entity190 , winner of this year 's @entity191 on @entity192 , who likened it to another sport			1
" it 's the one time when it feels like you 're inside a football stadium , " he says			1
" there 's just a crazy amount of shouting			0
it seems like it 's like that every day on the track			0
" when you get off the plane and the bus , you have people trying to get pictures , sign autographs , books and stuff like that			0
it 's stranger when it 's like half past 10 at night			0
@entity9 jockeys are used to it as they get it a lot			2
" the perception of horse racing in @entity9 has changed , pushed by the sport 's national ruling body the @entity41			1
in the past , it was seen to be the domain of the @entity228 , controlled by organized crime syndicates			0
the change in perception has led to a much younger racegoing public in @entity9 than generally seen in @entity67 or the @entity110 , for example			1
@entity234 , a director of the @entity235 which looks after the @entity180 on behalf of the @entity41 , describes those fans as " producing an atmosphere like i 've never seen before			0
" " as the starter goes up in a lift to his starting position , there 's chanting and everyone hits their racing cards together , " she says			2
" you ca n't help but get goosebumps from it			0
" race meetings are incomparable to @entity67			0
only taking place on saturdays and sundays , as opposed to week - long schedules in many countries , the racing starts as early as 10.30 in the morning			2
the card usually consists of 10 races , with a break in the middle and usually a jumps race amid the array of flat racing on show			2
and such is its popularity , fans will camp out the night before to get tickets for the day 's action			0
all of it is run centrally by the @entity41 , with a stipulation that each trainer can oversee just 30 horses each			0
increasingly , the caliber of horses is on the rise , with the @entity274 family in particular leading the way in buying the top horses across the globe -- starting in 1990 with @entity110 colt @entity278 , which sired @entity77 among others			0
" over the past 20 years , they 've been buying @entity191 winners and they 've now got some of the finest bloodstock in the world , " @entity139 says			2
" they 've got very good horses and they 're becoming increasingly hard to beat			0
as a result , it 's very hard to win there			0
" the lure of @entity9 to trainers like @entity159 is obvious , with the pots on offer usually enormous			2
" you can only race there if you 're invited over by the @entity41 and they pay for all your expenses to get there and while you 're over there , " he says			0
it is similar for jockeys too , and @entity190 is more familiar than most with the machinations of the @entity9 horse - racing world , having first ridden there in 2006			1
" you get 5 % of the racing purse , which is generally half of what you 'd get in @entity67 , but the prize money is so much higher , " he says			0
" it 's probably the best - run horse racing in the world			1
you never see any horses that are non-runners , no - one 's overweight and there 's never any hiccups			2
" you can only ride there for three months at a time and only six foreign jockeys can be there at any one time			0
the standard of horses is as good as anywhere in the world			0
" but being there is a very difficult culture			0
it 's about as alien from us as a culture as you can get			0
everyone 's very helpful and the language is n't an issue as you have an interpreter with you the whole time			0
sometimes it can be quite lonely out there as there 's not too many people speaking @entity340			0
but the standard of racing is top class			0
" while @entity190 and his foreign peers can expect to be mobbed there , it is nothing in comparison to @entity9 's own riders -- in particular @entity350 , who will ride @entity122 on sunday			1
his first @entity127 ride was on board @entity352 in 1994 , when the general consensus was that he did not have a good ride and finished sixth			0
he was then second on @entity77 in 2006 when again he should well have won and was also third on @entity355 in 2001			0
@entity40 says the 44 - year - old " is akin to a @entity356 in @entity9 , " such is the adulation , adding that " he has been quite big in contributing to the development of horse racing in @entity9 over the past 25 years			1
" should take win on @entity122 , it would be doubly poignant			2
the horse 's name literally translates as " ties " or " bond , " and he was named in the wake of the 2011 tsunami by owner @entity369 -- the colt in turn has become an equine hope for the nation			2
after his most recent win on @entity122 , take said : " i really appreciate being able to ride a horse with a name that carries so much emotional power and also because of the reason why he was called @entity122			1
it gives me great pride to be given this responsibility			0
" should @entity9 's most celebrated jockey win riding a horse with arguably the most emotional baggage in memory of the 18,000 people that lost their lives , it will be the ultimate way for the nation to celebrate breaking its duck in @entity22 .			1

@entity9 bid to end their @entity62 hoodoo at sunday 's big race
@entity191 winner @entity190 talks of football stadium - like mentality in @entity9 racing
public obsesses about @entity122 jockey @entity350 , likened to the @entity356 of the sport
