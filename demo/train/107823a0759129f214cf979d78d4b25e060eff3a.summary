@entity0 -- @entity2 grew up a military kid and , like most military families , often moved as her dad rose through the ranks of the @entity7			1
enamored with the military and her father 's service to his country , @entity2 decided in high school that military life was calling her			1
" i think it 's definitely a tight - knit community , and i was willing to be a part of that , " @entity2 recalled of her decision to join the @entity15 , commonly called @entity15 , at age 18			1
" i think the families are welcomed			0
i remember going to a base , and we 'd be welcomed by these families we did n't even know			0
" when the @entity23 offered her a full scholarship to @entity25 , @entity2 jumped at the chance to become a nurse and serve her country			1
@entity25 is a @entity29 university , a perfect fit for the practicing @entity29			0
nothing captured her feeling of community and sense of military pride more than when her equally proud father , capt. @entity36 , swore in his oldest child as a second lieutenant in the @entity23			1
" it was very special , '' she recalled of her commissioning in july 2011 , shortly after college graduation			0
" i was so happy that ( my parents ) had an opportunity to come out and be a part of that ceremony and have him administer the oath of office to me as an active - duty officer			2
" today , her dream of serving her country has been shattered			0
weeks before being commissioned as a military officer , @entity2 discovered that she was pregnant			1
that was before she says she learned the @entity23 forbid single parents from enlisting			1
the reason for the policy , according to @entity23 officials , is that the demands of deployment and military service put strain on family life and even more so for single parents			1
the @entity23 accused @entity2 of committing fraud , ejected her from its ranks and revoked her $ 92,000 scholarship			1
her case is currently under review			2
@entity71 ' mother , @entity70 , a military wife for 25 years , said deployments are tough on all service members and their families , married or not			2
if her daughter were to deploy , @entity75 said , her grandson would be well cared for by an extended family that includes the child 's father and both sets of grandparents			0
@entity71 ' mother said she believes the policy discriminates against single women and encourages pregnant single women to abort their pregnancies			2
" the @entity23 is making an assumption that single parents can not provide adequately for their children if deployed , " @entity2 ' mother said			1
" that 's what burns me up			0
" after she was " dis - enrolled " from the @entity23 -- the military term for the separation from service -- @entity2 appealed to the @entity23 and her congressman , rep. @entity96 , now the @entity98 nominee for vice president			1
the @entity23 rejected her initial appeal but said this week that her case is now being reviewed at the highest levels			1
@entity2 has also hired a military attorney , @entity103			1
@entity2 , her family and her attorney claim that the @entity23 is encouraging its members to give up their children , through either adoption or abortion , a position they say was revealed in a comment from an @entity23 colonel			1
in a letter responding to @entity96 's inquiry on @entity2 ' case , col. @entity119 wrote , " if ms. @entity2 had reported her pregnancy she would have been placed on medical recheck status until she gave birth			1
at that time she would have been been able to commission if she were not a single parent , for example , if she were married , or had given the child up for adoption			2
" @entity1 has repeatedly asked to interview @entity119 , to no avail			0
@entity2 said that letter confirms her fear at the time she discovered she was pregnant			1
she had just found out that she was expecting when she had what would be one of her final counseling sessions with an officer , as required by the @entity15			1
" he just says , ' i do n't know what would happen to a cadet if she were to become pregnant			0
but i do n't think it would be good			0
so just do n't get pregnant , ' " @entity2 recalled of the conversation with the officer			1
" he said that word for word to me			0
at that point , i thought , ' ok , i do n't think i have to tell anybody this			0
' " @entity2 completed all her physical and academic requirements , telling only her boyfriend and her family of her pregnancy			2
abortion was never an option , she said , because of her catholic faith and her personal beliefs			0
thirteen weeks into her pregnancy , she was sworn in by her father as a second lieutenant and started making plans to go to @entity154 to begin her military service			2
five months into her pregnancy , she said , she told her new commanders that she was going to have a child , and they told her they did n't think it would be a problem			0
citing a contract she signed in 2007 when she enrolled in @entity15 at age 18 , the @entity23 said she committed a fraud by not reporting a change in her medical condition , as indicated in the contract			1
the @entity23 ejected her , noting in its ruling , " it is not the responsibility of the staff to constantly remind you of the terms of your contract			1
" it further stated that her file contained eight forms in which she was briefed on the medical change reporting requirement			0
@entity2 said no one ever brought the issue up during her subsequent counseling sessions while she was enrolled at @entity25			2
@entity2 said she asked the officer who informed her that she was being ejected from the @entity23 , " had i terminated the pregnancy before my commissioning , would i have been able to commission at that point ? " and , according to @entity2 , " he said , ' well			1
' that was the hardest part of all of this			0
someone telling me to my face that had i gotten an abortion , then i would be eligible for service			0
" in a statement to @entity1 , a spokesman for the @entity23 said it had no knowledge of that conversation			2
" any such counseling would have been inappropriate and i have seen no evidence of any such discussion , '' maj. @entity194 wrote			0
" however , ms. @entity2 ' case is under review by the @entity200			1
" @entity194 also said the @entity23 would never tell non-married service members to give up their children , despite @entity119 ' letter to @entity96			2
" the assertion that the @entity23 would in any way encourage single parents to give up their children is unfounded , " he wrote			1
the @entity207 and their attorney feel otherwise			0
" this offends me on a number of different levels , " said @entity103 , the attorney			0
" because we 're telling young single woman that they can not serve if they have a child			0
that they have to get married , give the baby up or have an abortion			0
" @entity2 said she realizes there will be those who say she should n't have gotten pregnant or have gone public with her story			1
she said that she may have made a mistake but that she now has a beautiful 10 - month old son , @entity224 , to show for it and he is no mistake			0
she is taking responsibility for her actions and raising her child			0
she hopes that because she has told her story , the military will reconsider its policy on single parents being allowed to enlist			1
as she waits for her situation to be resolved , @entity2 is working as a pediatric nurse , paying $ 100 a month -- with interest -- toward the $ 92,000 scholarship debt			2
after all , @entity75 points out , defense secretary @entity236 recently stated his commitment " to removing all the barriers that would prevent @entity239 from serving their country " when hailing last year 's decision to abandon the " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy for gay men and women serving in the military			2
she hopes his words will apply to women like her daughter			0
" i believe a woman has the right to choose life , go on to serve and reach ( her ) full potential , including being an officer in the @entity23 , " @entity75 said			2
