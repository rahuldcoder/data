-- the @entity2 's decision to impose sweeping sanctions on @entity4 , a move followed by @entity6 , reflects an unprecedented level of collective action by the historically moribund regional body			1
the sunday vote by 19 @entity12 states to punish @entity4 further isolates @entity13 and undermines president @entity15 's self - proclaimed role as the dominant voice of @entity12 nationalism			2
indeed , the activist role adopted by the @entity2 as the 2011 @entity12 uprisings unfold has been a surprising development : following decades of issuing lowest common denominator communiques , the league is rapidly emerging as a key regional actor			1
the @entity2 's strong condemnation last spring of @entity26 's brutality easily could have been dismissed as a one - off , given the @entity30 strongman 's success at enraging most @entity12 leaders over the years			1
yet by following up its suspension of @entity4 from the organization with tough sanctions , it 's clear the @entity2 is taking on a more muscular role in the unfolding regional drama			1
there are four main reasons for this new @entity2 approach : first and foremost : the @entity12 uprisings themselves			0
if nothing else , the protests of 2011 brought the power of @entity12 public opinion front and center			1
gone are the days when @entity12 leaders could act with total disregard for their people 's opinions			1
public opinion throughout the @entity12 world resoundingly disapproved of @entity26 's behavior , and now of @entity15 's			1
this sentiment is motivating @entity12 leaders to respond to their people 's anger , through the @entity2			1
the corollary to this is @entity12 leaders ' fear that if they stand idly by while @entity15 slaughters @entity4 , popular resentment could boomerang against them			1
whereas popular discontent was traditionally channeled toward @entity64 and the @entity65 , collective @entity12 opprobrium is now targeted at brutal @entity12 regimes			0
if they fail to act , many @entity12 leaders could suffer political heartache and more popular unrest at home			2
getting ahead of this demonstrates that they respond to public opinion , and it helps deflect popular discontent away from domestic issues			0
on the geo - strategic level , @entity2 activism is motivated by a desire to keep the @entity12 in the drivers ' seat			1
with the @entity82 largely over the horizon , @entity12 docility only creates windows of opportunity for non-arabs to muck about in @entity88 diplomacy			0
@entity6 has not succeeded in creating a leading diplomatic role for itself in the region , despite efforts to play an active role in @entity30 , @entity93 and other hot spots			0
the @entity12 want to ensure that this remains the case			0
hence , @entity97 was relegated to supporting the measures adopted by the @entity2 , not initiating them			0
the other geo - strategic explanation for @entity2 activism is @entity100			0
the @entity12 , particularly the @entity101 , have long decried @entity100 's encroachment in @entity4 , @entity103 , and the @entity105 territories			2
isolating @entity100 's key strategic ally in the region -- @entity15 's @entity4 -- provides a significant opportunity to roll back some of @entity110 's regional gains			2
already , @entity112 ' @entity13 - based leadership is looking for a new home and behaving with greater restraint			0
and when @entity100 was seen to be meddling in @entity116 's sectarian struggle earlier this year , the @entity101 brutally crushed it -- collectively			0
with the @entity82 withdrawing from an @entity118 they see as now heavily influenced by @entity100 , the other @entity12 states have even greater incentive to band together			0
in taking strong actions , the @entity2 claims to want to stave off foreign intervention in @entity4			2
@entity124 's prime minister @entity123 hinted at this when he said that he " hoped " the @entity2 's sanctions would obviate the need for foreign intervention			1
in the short term , a more active @entity12 role may indeed make @entity132 nations hesitate to get involved -- but as was the case in @entity30 , the @entity2 might actually be providing the necessary regional legitimacy for outside intervention			2
this @entity2 activism may signal a new regional norm analogous to the @entity139 ' " responsibility to protect			0
" the @entity2 has effectively joined the international rejection of the three - century old @entity142 system that enshrined the nonintervention of one state in the domestic affairs of another state			0
@entity12 leaders can no longer turn a blind eye to the abhorrent behavior of fellow @entity12 rulers			1
this is a welcome development , one that could head off other foreign interventions in the @entity88 and encourage further collective action against brutal acts some @entity12 leaders perpetrate against their own people			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity160 .			0

@entity160 : @entity2 's tough sanctions on @entity4 show new activism in region
public opinion now has power , he writes ; leaders ca *n't* stand by as @entity4 are slaughtered
@entity160 says @entity2 is taking charge to ensure @entity12 are in the regional drivers ' seat
@entity160 : @entity12 leaders can no longer ignore others ' brutality , a welcome development
