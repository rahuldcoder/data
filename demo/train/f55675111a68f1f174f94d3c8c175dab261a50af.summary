" he tells us at the beginning of the film : " you know most people live kind of in the middle , in between ' all your dreams come true ' and ' you 're dying , ' and it 's a very comfortable place to live			1

i have n't had the chance to let it sink in			0
i do n't let myself go to that place of grief			0
there will be plenty of time to think about what we have lost later			0
" and maybe , she said , that is the lesson here : that no matter where you are in life , look at what you have and be grateful			0
it 's the kind of thing you hear all the time , but putting it into action takes some work			2
" that 's what @entity160 always been really good at : recognizing what is good and being grateful for it , " @entity32 said			2
" he taught all of us how it 's done			2
" @entity166 , one of the @entity13 commenters on @entity1 's video , writes : " well , you got a 6 ' , 220 pound man sobbing his face off here			1
prayers and thoughts with you , @entity1 ... i hope someday i can be half the man you 've become			2
" so many of us felt the same way as we watched his video for " clouds " -- grateful for having had him walk among us , albeit for a short time , as he sang : " and maybe someday i 'll see you again			2
