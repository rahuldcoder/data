-- like the six other former captives who have been through the @entity5 's reintegration program at @entity6 before him , daily life for sgt. @entity2 is focused on routine			1
he rises , eats and sleeps on a " normal schedule " and lives in a " typical " room at the huge hospital facility on a floor he shares with other patients			0
what is n't typical is the security presence outside his door			0
the reason , says col. @entity18 , command spokesman for @entity19 , is not to keep the returnee in , but " to make sure he does n't get overwhelmed in a social setting			2
" in other words , the goal is to prevent someone unwanted by either @entity2 or his reintegration team from entering			1
the medical center has a staff of hundreds , but @entity32 's newest and perhaps most controversial returnee interacts daily with a very small , intimate circle numbering less than a dozen			1
one of the most important parts of his routine is storytelling			0
the returnee personally recounts all that happened from the moment he left the security of his post in @entity43 , though the five years he survived in captivity , right up until the day he was freed last month			0
and for the first time , the person telling that story is @entity2 himself			1
the listeners are a small group of professionals including a @entity51 ) psychologist , members of his medical team and @entity5 debriefers			1
" the idea is to take the returnee from former captive all the way through a safe landing , where we have a soldier who can step forward as a soldier and do the next thing the @entity5 calls on him to do , " @entity18 says			1
army general to start investigating how , why @entity2 left base @entity2 may be the seventh former captive reintegrated since @entity19 was tasked to be the center for assisting them , but he is the first junior enlisted person to go through the program			1
previous returnees were either @entity72 employees or contractors			0
the program began at @entity6 in @entity75 , @entity76 , in 2006			0
" @entity78 life gradually expands to cover all things you and i take for granted " , @entity18 says , " personal encounters , personal hygiene , recreation / leisure and structure including direction , guidance and instruction ( having a leader telling you when and where to do something )			0
the goal is to provide the returnee the opportunity to make more and more decisions on his own and exercise more personal freedom			1
" when i ask if maj. gen. @entity98 , the man leading the military 's investigation into how @entity2 left his post in @entity43 , had been in touch with the sergeant , i was referred to the @entity72			1
@entity18 would say only that " investigation is not part of reintegration			0
" " does sgt. @entity2 have access to an attorney ? " i ask			1
" legal counsel is available throughout the entire reintegration process , " is the reply			0
@entity2 has a long road ahead previous captives have completed their reintegration in a week to 10 days , but each case is as unique as the conditions of captivity , military experts say , and there have been early suggestions that @entity2 's stay may be much longer			1
officially , the @entity5 will say only that the length of treatment is " event - driven , not timeline - driven			2
" and just where will @entity2 go after he completes reintegration ? since he is still an active member of the @entity5 , @entity18 said , " he will go where the @entity5 will tell him to go			1
" past returnees have gone back to family and back to their places of employment , such as contractors			0
" anyone in a military unit would return to their branch of service			0
" in this case , the @entity5			2
" once @entity2 is cleared to leave @entity75 , the orders for his next destination are likely to come from @entity140 at @entity141 , @entity142			2
but @entity18 says he does n't know if any such decision has been made yet			0
what is pretty much decided is that unlike his life now , life after reintegration for the 28 - year - old probably will be anything but routine			2
@entity151 on @entity2 deal : ' we could have done a better job '			2

sgt. @entity2 is *recovering* at a medical center after his release from @entity158
@entity5 reintegration program puts a focus on routine
goal is to give him " the opportunity to make more and more decisions on his own "
