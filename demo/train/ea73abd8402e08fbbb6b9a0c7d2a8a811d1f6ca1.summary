@entity0 -- a woman who helped raise a child with her female partner in @entity6 before the pair split can visit the girl in @entity9 even though that state does n't recognize same - sex unions , a court ruled friday			1
@entity12 with @entity13 , the daughter she helped raise with former partner @entity14			2
@entity9 's @entity15 ruled that @entity12 and @entity14 's civil union in 2000 gave @entity6 , and its law on same - sex unions , jurisdiction over their subsequent custody and visitation disputes			1
@entity14 moved to @entity9 with the child in 2003 , and a @entity6 court granted @entity12 visitation rights			1
but @entity14 took the case to a @entity9 court , which ruled that @entity12 had no such rights there			1
the case was considered by legal experts to be the first conflict between two state courts over a major legal question arising from same - sex unions			0
@entity36 ' attorney , @entity38 of the @entity0 law firm @entity37 , said friday 's ruling " just affirms the old principle that when these kinds of custody and visitation disputes begin in one state , that 's where they should remain			1
" " you ca n't shop them around to another state , " @entity38 said			0
" @entity9 really had no choice but to enforce judgments and judicial orders from @entity6			2
" @entity6 is one of the few states that allow same - sex partners to enter into a civil union			1
two years after @entity6 recognized @entity14 and @entity12 ' relationship , @entity14 gave birth to a daughter , @entity13 , conceived through artificial insemination			1
the relationship deteriorated , and @entity14 and the baby moved to @entity9			1
a @entity6 court later granted @entity14 a dissolution of the civil union and granted custody of the child to her and visitation rights to @entity12			1
@entity14 then asked the courts in @entity9 -- which does not recognize same - sex unions or marriages -- to take jurisdiction of the dispute			1
a @entity9 state judge eventually ruled that @entity12 had no " parentage or visitation rights			2
" the @entity9 high court ruling friday returned the case to @entity6 's control , meaning @entity12 can visit the girl , who is now 6			1
@entity14 's attorney , @entity79 , said he was " disappointed the state sidestepped the larger legal questions			2
" " this case shows that one state is not an island in the same - sex marriage dispute , and underscores having state laws that protect traditional one - man , one - woman marriages , " said @entity79 , chairman of @entity82 , a law firm that fights on behalf of what it calls " traditional families			0
" @entity14 said in 2005 that she was doing what was best for her daughter and was no longer a lesbian			0
" i am @entity13 's mom			0
i did conceive her ; i birthed her , " she said			0
" i 'm raising her			0
and in my opinion , @entity13 needs to stay with me 100 percent of the time , because i am the only person that she identifies as a mom			0
" @entity14 lives with @entity13 in @entity100 , @entity9			2
@entity12 did not offer an immediate reaction to the ruling but said in 2005 that she was only fighting for her rights as a parent			2
" justice will be served for @entity13 , " she said			0
and i 'll do whatever it takes			0
i 'll be with her for as long as i can , or i 'll be without her for as long as i have to , but i 'm her mom			0
" she 's born here [ in @entity6 ]			0
" @entity38 said @entity12 , who lives in @entity112 , @entity6 , was supposed to visit @entity13 last weekend , but @entity14 did n't appear with the girl			1
friday 's ruling comes a week after the @entity116 @entity15 's refusal to delay its recent decision legalizing same - sex marriage in the state			1
@entity120 also allows same - sex marriages ; @entity6 and three other states permit civil unions , and 12 other states give gay and lesbian couples some legal rights			0
@entity9 amended its constitution in 2007 to decree that marriage is defined as a union between one man and one woman .			0

@entity9 ruling gives @entity6 court jurisdiction over case
@entity12 and @entity14 were in civil union in @entity6 but later split
@entity14 moved to @entity9 with child ; @entity6 court allowed @entity12 visitation
@entity14 got @entity9 court to *block* visitation ; friday 's ruling *overturns* that
