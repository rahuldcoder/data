-- " you got ta pull it together man , " @entity0 , the final guest on " @entity1 with @entity2 , " told his friend			1
" you 're moving up a time slot , across the hall , bigger stage , this is all good stuff ! " @entity12 , who has proven again in his last week before taking over " @entity14 " just what a gracious , big - hearted guy he is , agreed that he was a mess			1
" i 'm an @entity19 mush ! " he said			2
and bless him for it			2
@entity2 gets emotional during last ' @entity1 ' show @entity12 navigated his final week with a sense of decency that was both unapologetic and generous			1
three episodes were taped remembrances of the show 's best digital shorts ( like " @entity35 " ) , musical performances ( an acoustic version of " @entity31 " that somehow managed to rinse clean the scuzz of the song ) , and comedy bits ( i could watch @entity37 trying to make a taco with mannequin hands every night of the week )			2
meanwhile he was a sweet and respectful guest for @entity40 , for long an easy butt of late night comedians but whom @entity12 never shamed or undercut throughout this long transition			1
i admit to feeling confused by thursday 's penultimate show , as @entity12 returned to his more traditional format			1
his monologue was pitch perfect , bowing down to " @entity14 " host of 22 years			1
" the ratings have been so good i think we 're going to have another week of saying goodbye to @entity40 , " he said			2
" it was @entity40 's last show tonight			2
" he paused to point out the obvious to the always excellent @entity55			2
" i mean , in a way it 's good for me ... " he said			0
later , @entity58 came on and seemed uncomfortable pitching his underwhelming " @entity59			0
" @entity60 seemed better suited to the sense of growing nostalgia in the studio			0
" nice people deserve success , " @entity60 told @entity12 in his congratulations before the lot donned ridiculous bubble suits and played elevator soccer			1
@entity2 writes @entity40 a truly thoughtful thank - you note that 's where so much of the pleasure in watching @entity12 is found			1
he 's game and a goof , completely lacking in cynicism and guile			0
when he 's playing the guitar next to @entity80 or hashtagging with @entity81 he has the shiny glee of a kid let loose in a candy store			0
if this sounds like an unabashed enthusiastic fan note , maybe it 's because i 'm writing about a man with such unabashed enthusiasm			0
the only thing clearer than how much @entity12 loves what he gets to do for a living is how much he leans on and respects the people he gets to do it with			1
towards the end of the show , @entity55 assured @entity12 he was going to be great on " @entity14 " starring @entity2			1
" you 're going to be so good because you 're nice , you 're sweet , you 're super hilarious and you are the best person on earth , " his friend said			0
" you are perfect for this job			0
" in " @entity1 's " final moments , after @entity12 's low - key and tender performance of " @entity106 " with the @entity108 band , its host walked alone down the deserted hall of @entity111			1
on the other side of the exit waited @entity12 's exuberant cast and crew			2
he jumped into their celebratory scrum as the door closed behind him			0
it was at once the perfect ending and an auspicious beginning			0
there are so many great clips from " @entity1 " but i also picked this weird one of @entity125 throwing up because of @entity12 's stunned and delighted reaction			1
fittingly , it was one of the host 's favorite memories from 969 shows			0
