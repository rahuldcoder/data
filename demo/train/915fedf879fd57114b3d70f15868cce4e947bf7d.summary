@entity0 -- the year 2013 started off with a fiercely emotional gun - control debate that dominated @entity0 for months , as both sides felt bolstered and more fervent than ever with the nation stunned by the mass shooting of first graders in @entity7 , @entity8			1
but that 's as far as it would go			0
a year after the massacre at @entity14 elementary , there would be no expanded background checks or other substantial legislative changes in place at the national level			1
there was yet another school shooting in suburban @entity21 on friday , and advocates are still fighting for tougher firearms laws			2
but attention has shifted to another common root of tragedies like @entity14 elementary , the 2011 attack on then - @entity30 rep. @entity29 , and the @entity32 rampage -- a mental health system that many say desperately needs fixing			1
an alternative route the @entity36 approved bipartisan legislation on thursday that would create pilot programs in 10 states to enhance access to mental health services			1
the @entity36 measure , co-authored by sen. @entity43 , @entity44 , and sen. @entity45 , @entity46 , was one of at least three - dozen bills introduced or re-introduced in @entity49 this year that specifically focused on mental health issues			1
in the previous two years , or the previous session , about 30 bills were introduced			0
but none passed the @entity54 or @entity36			0
on the other side of @entity56 thursday , a @entity57 congressman from @entity58 , @entity59 , became the latest lawmaker to introduce new legislation specifically tailored to mental health			1
@entity59 , who spent three decades as a psychologist before coming to @entity49 , said little has been done in the past few decades to get people the help they need			2
" this nation has moved forward in knowledge of what it takes to help , but has moved backwards in getting that help done , " he said this week			0
" and where there is no help , there is no hope			2
" the @entity54 has also been highlighting mental health in the week leading up to the december 14 @entity7 anniversary			1
vice president @entity78 on tuesday announced $ 100 million in new funding from the @entity81 administration to improve mental health facilities and community centers			1
so what changed ? on april 18 , a divided @entity36 rejected a measure that would expand background checks to cover purchases at gun shows and over the @entity89			1
of all the gun control proposals raised in @entity49 and at the @entity54 , it was considered perhaps the most viable because it was the least aggressive			1
in the same package , however , an amendment aimed at addressing mental health was backed overwhelmingly by the @entity36 , 95 - 2			1
the country was again confronted with a mass shooting in september , this time at the @entity32			0
but the shooting by a lone gunman who killed 12 people hardly moved the dial in the halls of @entity49 just two miles from the massacre scene			2
at a memorial service in @entity0 , @entity81 gave some of his most forceful remarks in favor of gun control , yet the speech barely made headlines			1
predictably , a few lawmakers argued the shooting marked another case for firearm restrictions			0
but as more information came in out about the shooter 's troubled past with mental illness , lawmakers started talking more about mental health			1
sen. @entity119 , @entity120 , helped introduce the @entity36 amendment that received strong support back in april			0
she said friday in a statement to @entity1 that she has called on @entity36 leaders to bring the measure for a vote " immediately			0
" " it 's clear that this bill could pass with overwhelming bipartisan support , " she said			0
the legislation , which was introduced with @entity132 sens. @entity131 of @entity133 and @entity134 of @entity8 , would improve mental health training for teachers , emergency personnel , and others in the community			1
it would also renew suicide prevention programs			0
states taking charge meanwhile , states have been taking on their own steps to boost mental health care all year			1
state funding for mental health hit major setbacks during the recession			1
between 2009 and 2012 , states cut $ 4.35 billion from their budgets for such services , according to the @entity154			2
but as the economy gradually got better in 2013 , states were throwing money back into their mental health systems			1
@entity159 allocated a $ 259 million increase this year ; @entity161 added $ 143 million			2
@entity162 and @entity163 also reversed cuts			0
all told , 36 states and the @entity0 increased their mental health budgets for fiscal year 2013 - 2014			1
six saw a decrease in funding , while eight remained the same as the year before , according to a report issued by @entity154 in late october			2
state legislatures also passed other laws that centered around increased mental health screening services , especially for children and adolescents , trying to identify problems before they fully manifest , the report said			1
outgoing @entity178 gov. @entity177 this past week announced an additional $ 38.3 million for mental health in his state for the next two years			1
his announcement came less than a month after @entity182 , his former rival in two statewide elections and a popular state senator , was stabbed repeatedly by his own son , who then shot and killed himself			0
one day prior , officials said @entity182 ' son had essentially been turned away from a medical facility because it lacked enough psychiatric beds			0
well known in the @entity0 and @entity178 political circles , @entity182 ' case seemed to resonate in the nation 's capital			0
when rep. @entity59 introduced his new legislation on thursday , he alluded to the situation			0
" no more being ' told there are no more beds , take your son or daughter home ' no matter how much they are at risk of hurting you or themselves , " he said			0
will @entity210 make an impact ? mental health advocates say the future also looks promising because of reforms from the @entity210			1
with the expansion of @entity216 — the largest public coverage provider for mental health services — in about half the states , an estimated 2.7 million people with mental illnesses could qualify for insurance , according to the @entity223			1
another 2.6 million with mental illness could qualify for subsidies to buy private health insurance in the marketplaces under @entity210			2
another part of the @entity210 requires small group and individual health plans to cover mental health services at the same rate as general medical care , a practice that 's already been in place for larger group plans since 2008			1
some critics , however , argue that @entity216 and @entity237 are limited in its scope for mental health treatment			2
for example , certain mental health services will only be reimbursed for those under the age of 21 and older that 65 — missing a huge bloc of people			1
the bill introduced by @entity59 on thursday seeks to fight other policies that permit only one prescription drug per therapeutic class , meaning physicians ca n't prescribe all the medications they could for certain illnesses under the public programs			0
breaking down barriers the past year has also seen continued efforts at reducing the stigma of mental illness			2
at a @entity54 conference on mental health this summer , @entity78 delivered a frank and emotional plea to those fighting mental illness			2
" there is nothing , nothing to be ashamed of if you are struggling with mental issues or if your child is or your spouse or your friend , " he said			0
it 's okay to talk about it			0
it 's okay to ask for help			0
it is okay to acknowledge that it is frightening			0
" the summit also featured celebrities who talked about their own experiences , and the @entity81 administration launched a new website — mentalhealth.gov — that educates readers on recognizing signs of mental illness and directing them on how to get help			0
breaking down the stigma of mental illness has been a @entity54 mission for more than a decade			0
in 1999 , president @entity291 's administration held the first @entity54 conference on mental health , and president @entity294 continued the tradition			2
" mental illness is nothing to be ashamed of , " @entity291 said , when he first announced the conference			0
" but stigma and bias shame us all			0

@entity7 massacre a year *ago* prompted hope among gun control advocates for action
but @entity49 did not approve tougher measures , *including* expanded background checks
now , there is some movement on legislative proposals to bolster mental health services
states are also acting on this issue , and gun control advocates are taking it up , too
