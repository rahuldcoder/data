the difference between the scale of the @entity4 terrorist threat and the threat in the @entity6 was underlined by wednesday 's arrest of @entity8 , a 20 - year - old @entity9 resident , who had been monitored by an @entity11 informant and was allegedly plotting an attack , inspired by @entity13 , against the @entity14			1
one day after @entity8 's arrest @entity16 authorities took down a group they believed was plotting imminent attacks , resulting in a battle with the suspects who opened fire with military weaponry and handguns			2
two of the suspects were killed			0
some members of the group had reportedly returned from fighting in @entity29 with @entity13			0
the two cases could hardly be more different			0
in @entity9 , we saw the arrest of a classic lone wolf allegedly inspired by @entity13 with aspirations to carry out an attack but scant capabilities , while in @entity16 we saw the takedown of what appears to have been an @entity13 cell with serious capacities for attack			0
this contrast can also be seen if we carefully analyze the tactics and characteristics of last week 's @entity46 attacks and compare them with the @entity47 in 2013			1
in @entity46 jihadist terrorists killed 17 people in a series of attacks , beginning with the assault on the offices of @entity54 , followed by the killing of a policewoman and a hostage - taking in a kosher grocery			1
the attacks received sustained global media coverage throughout the three days that they unfolded			2
in addition to the three shooters , at least a dozen others are suspected of some kind of involvement in the @entity46 attacks			1
the attackers had a substantial weapons cache , including assault rifles , @entity72 cocktails , a grenade and even a rocket - propelled grenade			0
they also had bulletproof vests			0
two of the attackers had traveled to @entity78 , where they received training from @entity80			0
the attacks in @entity46 were the most deadly by jihadists in @entity4 in a decade			1
the terrorists adopted so - called @entity83 -- " those who sacrifice themselves " -- tactics in which armed men assault targets with the intention of fighting to the death to prolong the battle as long as possible , thereby maximizing media coverage and the number of casualties			0
the most deadly example of such an attack were the assaults in @entity97 , @entity98 , in 2008 by 10 @entity101 @entity100 operatives , which killed 166 people			0
similar to those in @entity46 , the @entity97 attacks involved multiple targets , the operatives were armed with assault rifles , and the men had received training from a terrorist organization			1
the @entity97 attacks lasted four days , and they were intensively covered by media from around the world			0
on the other end of the spectrum , the @entity114 bombing provides an example of a less sophisticated attempt at a @entity120 - style attack			1
on april 15 , 2013 , @entity121 and @entity122 allegedly detonated two bombs along the route of the @entity114 , killing three people			0
three days later the @entity126 allegedly shot and killed a police officer at the campus of the @entity129 , and in the early morning of april 19 the @entity130 had an intense firefight with police in which @entity121 was killed and @entity122 was wounded and later taken into custody			0
as was the case in @entity46 , the @entity135 bombers had multiple targets , and the attackers appear to have intended to conduct attacks until they died			1
however , the bombers were not trained abroad by a terrorist group ; they were not part of a larger group of conspirators , and they were not as well - armed as the @entity46 conspirators			1
the @entity46 terrorists were more sophisticated in their tactics and training than the @entity135 bombers , but the @entity46 attacks were far less sophisticated than the attacks in @entity97			1
the terrorists in @entity97 received direction on their cell phones throughout their assault from their commanders who were manning a control room in @entity101			0
the @entity97 attacks also involved a larger number of people -- the 10 gunmen who infiltrated @entity98 as well as many others who provided training and support from @entity101 during the attack			0
the @entity46 attacks were , in short , a hybrid of the terrorist tactics that we saw in @entity135 with the tactics we saw in @entity97			1
@entity6 security officials warn that the @entity6 is at risk of similar attacks to those that occurred in @entity46			1
attorney general @entity171 told @entity0 's @entity172 , " what we saw in @entity174 over the course of this last week is unfortunately what we 're going to have to confront in the future			1
" the @entity6 is certainly at risk of some version of a @entity46 - like attack using @entity83 - style tactics			1
after all , a much-less sophisticated version -- the @entity135 attacks in 2013 -- has already happened			2
however , the history of jihadist plots inside the @entity6 since 9/11 suggests that the combination of terrorist characteristics and tactics that we saw in the @entity46 attacks would be unusual in the @entity6			1
in none of the deadly attacks conducted in the @entity6 since 9/11 have the participants received training from terrorist organizations abroad			1
@entity195 , who killed a @entity6 soldier in @entity198 , @entity199 , in 2009 ; maj. @entity200 , who killed 13 at @entity201 , @entity202 , the same year ; and the @entity135 bombers were all so - called lone wolves , none of whom had training or direction from a terrorist organization			1
these are in marked contrast with @entity174			0
as the @entity212 notes thousands of @entity174 citizens have traveled to fight in @entity29 or @entity214 and 200 have returned , a far less manageable challenge than the 150 or so @entity6 who have reportedly gone or attempted to go to fight in the @entity29 conflict			2
of those @entity6 , only about a dozen have joined jihadist groups , according to fbi director @entity219			2
this is not to say that @entity171 's warnings should be dismissed			2
firearms are , of course , widely available in the @entity6 , and one can certainly imagine a jihadist group forming to conduct an armed assault			2
a few such plots involving more than one or two lone wolves have been foiled in the @entity6 -- although none in the past few years			2
in 2009 , for instance , the @entity11 arrested a group of seven men in @entity232 led by @entity233 , who had amassed firearms and plotted attacks in the @entity6			1
the plot was foiled because informants had long monitored it after @entity233 's activities came to the @entity11 's attention in 2005			0
perhaps the closest the @entity6 came to seeing an armed assault similar to the one in @entity46 was in 2005 when @entity241 , @entity242 , @entity243 and @entity244 plotted attacks on a number of locations in @entity248 , including synagogues			1
the group was arrested after law enforcement linked the members to a robbery			0
the militants had no links to foreign terrorist organizations			0
nor is the @entity6 immune to plotting by individuals with training by terrorist groups abroad			2
in 2009 , three men -- @entity261 , @entity262 and @entity261 -- all of whom received weapons training in @entity101 's tribal areas , plotted to bomb the @entity268 subway but were arrested before they could do so			0
similarly , in 2010 , @entity269 , who was trained in @entity101 , tried to blow up an suv in @entity271			0
the bomb failed to detonate properly			0
given this history , it would be unwise to ignore @entity171 's warnings of the potential of @entity46 - like attacks inside the @entity6			1
however , there are real differences between the scale of the threat from terrorists in the @entity6 compared with the scale of the threat in @entity174 , and @entity6 policymakers and commentators should be careful to make those differences clear when speaking to the public .			2

attorney general @entity171 has warned of @entity46 - like attacks in the @entity6
@entity291 says so far attacks have been less sophisticated *domestically* than in @entity4
