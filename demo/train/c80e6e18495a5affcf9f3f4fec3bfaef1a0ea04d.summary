-- what do you do when your baby lies limp in your arms , staring blankly into the distance while never crying ? what do you do when tests show signs of liver damage and your baby 's seizures wo n't stop , but doctors ca n't tell you what 's wrong or how to fix it ? thanks to the @entity16 , which was completed in 2003 , identifying new genetic mutations has gotten easier and cheaper			1
but geneticists often struggle to find patients who share these rare dna quirks			1
studying multiple patients with the same gene mutations and similar symptoms is crucial to identifying a new genetic disorder			1
that 's why a paper published thursday in the journal @entity28 is so remarkable			1
the paper identifies @entity31 deficiency as an inherited genetic disorder , caused by mutations in the @entity31 gene			1
the researchers have confirmed eight patients with these mutations who share several symptoms , including developmental delays , abnormal tear production and liver disease			1
and they credit an " internet blog " with bringing the patients and scientists together			1
@entity46 's genome @entity48 's parents knew something was wrong right away			1
their newborn daughter was lethargic			1
her eyes seemed hollow and unfocused			1
doctors at the hospital ran multiple tests , but could n't come up with a diagnosis			2
eventually , the @entity56 took @entity46 home			2
as she grew older , @entity46 continued to exhibit troubling symptoms			2
her cognitive and motor development were far behind other children her age			2
she had hypotonia , a condition that made her constantly limp like a rag doll			2
tests revealed she had high levels of @entity68 and @entity70 liver enzymes , a sign of liver damage , but no one could figure out why			1
the @entity56 traveled the country with their baby girl to find an answer			2
they visited @entity77 and the @entity78 on the @entity79 , and several children 's hospitals on the @entity82			2
" we 've probably seen over 100 doctors , " @entity83 said			2
" we 've seen the best clinical minds in the @entity87			2
" not one of whom knew what was wrong with @entity46			2
when @entity46 was 2 years old , the @entity56 started doing whole genome sequencing at @entity92 near their home in the @entity94 and at @entity95 in @entity96			2
it was at @entity95 that they first met @entity98 , who was working on his doctorate in structural and computational biology and molecular biophysics in @entity95 's @entity102			2
' one was very bad , and one was pretty bad ' the first thing geneticists look for when searching for the cause of mysterious symptoms is known dna mutations , @entity103 said			2
" your first instinct should n't be ' i 'm going to find something new			2
( it should be ) ' i 'm going to find something someone has already discovered			2
' " once he 's crossed known disorders off the list , he looks for unusual mutations			0
all of us have mutations in our dna that do n't affect us in any noticeable way ; if you sequence 500 healthy people 's genomes , the same mutated genes would likely come up time and again			0
but unusual mutations -- like those @entity103 spotted in @entity46 's @entity31 gene -- are a sign that a particular gene may be causing a problem			1
think of your dna as a recipe , @entity103 said			0
some gene mutations are like little typos in that recipe			0
maybe your body adds a bit too much flour or an extra teaspoon of sugar			0
other gene mutations are more destructive ; they make your body leave out an entire ingredient , or delete half the recipe			0
@entity46 's mutations of the @entity31 gene were the destructive kind			1
" one was very bad , and one was pretty bad , " @entity98 said			0
the scientist knew he was onto something			0
he began searching online for any references to the @entity31 gene			1
some work had been done in fruit flies and mice , showing the gene 's mutations could cause the lab animals to function improperly			0
then he came across a paper published in the @entity159 that mentioned a young boy who had a genetic disorder that may be related to @entity31 mutations			1
@entity103 dug deeper and found a blog written by a man named @entity165 , an assistant professor at the @entity166			0
" my son @entity168 has a new genetic disorder , " might had written on may 29 , 2012			1
" scientists at @entity172 had used whole - exome sequencing to discover @entity168 had two different mutations on the @entity31 gene , which encodes the enzyme @entity176			1
n - glycanase 1 is typically found in a healthy person 's cells			0
it helps break down defective proteins so they can be reused throughout the body			0
" my son is the only human being known to lack this enzyme , " @entity165 wrote			0
@entity103 read @entity165 's previous posts about @entity168 's symptoms			0
they were similar to what @entity46 's parents had described			0
but the key seemed to be @entity168 's inability to cry			0
could @entity46 produce tears ? @entity103 asked @entity195 via e-mail on february 26 , 2013			1
not really , came @entity195 's reply			0
she 'd seen a large tear once or twice ; @entity46 's eyes would become moist , but multiple tears rarely fell			1
it was one of those moments as a scientist , @entity103 says , where everything falls into place			0
you know , the one where you would run down the street yelling " @entity210 ! " if that was something people actually said			0
" you start shaking a little bit			0
you force yourself not to tell anyone for 24 hours , " @entity98 said			0
" then you make a @entity218 presentation and see if you can convince other people			0
" finding others like ' @entity221 ' when the scientists at @entity172 first identified the mutations in @entity225 's @entity31 gene , they did n't know for sure that the mutations were causing the 4 - year - old boy 's symptoms			1
with only one patient , they had nothing to compare it to			0
still , " it was a huge relief , " @entity165 told @entity0 in an e-mail			0
" it meant that we 'd reached the end of a long and painful diagnostic odyssey ... being the only patient in the world was shocking , but we knew there must have been other @entity31 patients out there that were undiagnosed , just like @entity168			1
" @entity103 e-mailed might through his blog , and the @entity56 put the geneticist and others on @entity245 in contact with the scientists working on @entity168 's case			1
others discovered @entity165 's blog , as well			0
clinicians and genetic researchers around the globe who had sequenced the genomes of six isolated patients and found mutations in the @entity31 gene did the same thing @entity103 had			1
they searched for " @entity31 " online and found hope			1
" i think cognitively it 's really nice to have a label , " @entity195 said			0
" once you do have a name , you can then start looking for a cure			0
" @entity83 teamed up with @entity165 to write an editorial accompanying the @entity268 journal paper			0
in the editorial , the two fathers propose a new model for genetic researchers			1
their model uses a @entity274 approach of sharing successes and failures , and asks scientists not to underestimate the power of social media or a parent 's need for answers			1
" in order to diagnose patients , we must admit the limitations of our medical knowledge , " they write			1
" sometimes the best ideas come from individuals ' outside the box ' ( i.e. patients and parents ) ... sometimes the least likely gene candidate is the answer			1
" thanks to the " relentless digging " of the families , five treatment approaches are being studied , the fathers say			1
and the list of confirmed patients with @entity31 deficiency is up to 14 , according to @entity48			1
" this represents a complete change in the way we 're going about clinical medicine , " said @entity303 , co-lead author of the paper and a geneticist at @entity306			0
" this is happening so quickly because ... so many people are coming at this from so many angles			0

a new genetic disorder called @entity31 deficiency is identified in eight patients
@entity31 deficiency causes developmental delays , liver disease
kids with the disorder are usually unable to produce tears
fathers of two kids with @entity31 deficiency propose new model for scientists
