-- every time @entity3 rolls around , i learn something new about the @entity6 footprint in the @entity7 but until i spoke to @entity8 , i never knew how this celebration came to be			1
in may of 1988 , @entity8 , former intern for the @entity10 , was asked to work on a bill that would amend the 1968 federal law , authorized by president @entity13 , to change it from a week to a month - long celebration			1
today , @entity8 is a veteran journalist who has helped produce award - winning investigative and multimedia projects for the @entity17 , and a social - media expert who has taught reporters , students and academics in the @entity7 , @entity23 , the @entity24 and the @entity25			1
@entity8 said @entity26 , executive director of the caucus at the time , said a @entity29 version had already been introduced in 1987 by rep. @entity30 but was stalled by two subcommittees			2
a similar bill passed the @entity33 and there was support from all 13 @entity6 members of @entity37 in the @entity29			1
hearing this , @entity8 thought getting enough supporters " would be a slam dunk " -- until he received pushback from some quarters			2
" i got resistance at first			0
people did n't just did n't want to support commemorative legislation			0
people said things like , ' well , why would we do that ? are n't we all @entity7 ? that 's not a thing we want to support , ' " @entity8 said			1
" i was a bit naive at the time and did n't know what to do , so i asked the @entity55 to help me out , and we focused on writing ' @entity57 ' letters to @entity58 , @entity59 and @entity60			0
" what we now know as @entity62 originated in 1926 , founded by @entity63 as @entity62 , but then the celebration was expanded to a month in 1976			0
president @entity65 urged @entity7 to " seize the opportunity to honor the too - often neglected accomplishments of black @entity7 in every area of endeavor throughout our history			1
" @entity8 asked the @entity71 to put together a list of notable @entity6 achievements in order to better sell the bill to other members			1
" to me it was a fascinating learning experience			0
when i went to high school there was n't latino studies or chicano studies , " @entity8 said			1
" i knew of some history here and there , but was shocked to learn of all the @entity6 history in this country from the @entity87 , part of the @entity71			1
" this bill became a lot about self - discovery , " @entity8 said			1
he wrote in a piece for the @entity17 that he learned about such " notable figures as @entity94 , a military officer who aided @entity7 colonists in their fight against the @entity97 during the @entity98			2
then there was @entity100 , who was born in @entity101 and won the @entity102 in 1968			0
" there was a ticking clock element to @entity8 's task			0
since this was the second session of the 100th @entity37 , if the bill did n't pass this time around it would have to be introduced all over again			0
on an august morning in 1988 , @entity8 walked into the @entity29 gallery in a blazer and tie , watched the bill pass , and the battle was over without any big fuss			1
" i had no idea it would be as big as it is today , " said @entity8			2
the third - generation @entity115 grew up in an @entity117 - dominant household			0
his parents were raised in an area of @entity60 where you were punished for speaking @entity121 , where @entity115 immigrants were forced to be " @entity7 " and assimilate			0
so @entity8 did n't grow up speaking @entity121 at home			2
but that was n't the case for his two children , who attended @entity121 - language immersion schools			0
now , @entity23 dedicates a month , from september 15 to october 15 , to celebrating the culture and traditions of those who trace their roots to @entity132 , @entity133 and the @entity121 - speaking nations of @entity135 , @entity23 and the @entity24			0
after speaking to @entity8 , i felt a surge of urgency to keep sharing his story			2
i wonder what would have happened if he had n't been assigned this project during his internship			0
what if he had n't pushed for the bill with his " @entity57 " letter and phone calls , or even worse , what if the bill had been put on the back burner until the following year ? would we be celebrating @entity3 today ? " i hope @entity3 helps people learn the things i did n't know growing up , the importance of @entity154 in our history , and the contributions they 've have made , " @entity8 said			1
" it 's a good way to celebrate our own culture , but also for non-latinos to be exposed			0
you ca n't really understand @entity7 history without understanding @entity6 history			1

former @entity165 intern shares story of how @entity3 came to be
@entity8 pushed the idea in 1988 while working for @entity10
@entity8 faced resistance from members but kept working for passage of the bill
