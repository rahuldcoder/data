the mine has reopened , and about a third of the 28,000 workers had reported for duty by tuesday , according to @entity44			1
while most of the company 's work force and contractors are not on strike , many have been unable to return to work because of violence at the site , @entity44 said			1
on sunday , @entity44 issued a statement warning workers to return to work by monday or face the possibility of losing their jobs			1
while tuesday 's announcement dropped the threat , the company said it was encouraging the nearly 19,000 workers who have yet to return to their jobs to do so			1

they drive us on to make amends , to review in utmost depth the happenings in our sector , to check any further outbreaks -- indeed , to ensure that these things never , ever happen again , " she said			0
" the events should refocus the collective might of our nation on answers not recriminations , on rationality not rhetoric			0
we should refuse to be cowed into a state of mind where we accept the notion -- popular in certain circles abroad -- that we are nothing but a country at war with itself , " @entity150 said			0
a memorial service has been scheduled for thursday at the spot where miners and police clashed , the state - run @entity185 reported tuesday			1
" we felt the memorial service should be held there as part of cleansing the place , " the agency quoted @entity192 and traditional affairs minister @entity193 as saying			1
