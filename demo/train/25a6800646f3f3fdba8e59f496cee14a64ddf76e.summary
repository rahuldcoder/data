-- meat is murder ? well , perhaps not for much longer			2
artist @entity3 has satirized modern farming and meat production ; could in - vitro meat be a better option ? a pioneering group of scientists are working to grow real animal protein in the laboratory , which they not only claim is better for animal welfare , but actually healthier , both for people and the planet			1
it may sound like science fiction , but this technology to create in - vitro meat could be changing global diets within ten years			1
" cultured meat would have a lot of advantages , " said @entity21 of research group @entity22			1
" we could precisely control the amount of fat in meat			2
we could make ground beef with an ideal fatty acid ratio -- a hamburger that prevents heart attacks instead of causing them			0
" but it is n't just the possibility of creating designer ground beef with the fat profile of salmon that drives @entity21 's work			1
meat and livestock farming is also the source of many human diseases , which he claims would be far less common when the product is raised in laboratory conditions			2
" we could reduce the risks of diseases like swine flu , avian flu , ' mad cow disease ' , or contamination from @entity53 , " he told @entity0			0
" we could produce meat in sterile conditions that are impossible in conventional animal farms and slaughterhouses			1
and when we grow only the meat we can eat , it 's more efficient			2
there 's no need to grow the whole animal and lose 75 to 95 percent of what we feed it			2
" conventional meat production is also hard on the environment			1
the contribution of livestock to climate change was recently highlighted by the @entity71 ' report , " @entity70 " , while groups such as @entity73 and @entity74 have demonstrated how soy farming for animal feed contributes to the destruction of the @entity78			2
in this context @entity21 believes his project could significantly cut the environmental impact of meat production -- using much less water and producing far fewer greenhouse gases			1
" we could reduce the environmental footprint of meat , which currently contributes more to global warming than the entire transportation sector , " says @entity21			1
preliminary results from a study by @entity92 , at the @entity93 , @entity94 , suggest that cultured meat would reduce the carbon emissions of meat production by more than 80 percent			2
making cultured meat in - vitro meat is made from samples of animals conventionally slaughtered			1
for example , " pork " is made from pig ovaries retrieved from slaughterhouses , which are fertilized with pig semen , transforming them into embryos			2
they are then placed in a nutrient solution , where they grow and develop			0
it 's a long way from the popular image of animals wandering round the farmyard in the sunshine , but then so is modern intensive farming			0
the factor that could take the research from the lab to the store and into refrigerators around the world is its remarkable commercial potential			1
according to @entity22 , meat is already estimated to be a $ 1 trillion global market , and demand is expected to double by 2050			0
with concerns about health , animal welfare and the environment growing the appeal of in vitro meat is obvious			1
@entity21 told @entity0 that venture capitalists @entity133 have shown an interest in his technology , while @entity137 , a sausage subsidiary of food giant @entity139 , is a partner			1
the @entity141 ' government has also invested around $ 4 million in @entity141 research into in - vitro meat production			1
but it is n't just the suits who are circling with their checkbooks out -- campaign group @entity148 ( @entity148 ) have announced a $ 1 million prize for the first commercially viable in vitro chicken product			0
the @entity152 has also been supportive			0
" we think that a technology to produce cultured ground meats -- burgers , sausages , nuggets , and so forth -- could be commercialized within ten years , " said @entity21			1
" as with most technologies , successive generations should improve in price , quality , and acceptance			0
we do n't think that matching the taste and texture of ground meats will be very difficult			0
both conventional and cultured meat is made of muscle tissue			1
and conventional ground meat is typically highly processed			0
chicken nuggets for instance , are made of something called ' meat slurry ' -- it would be hard not to do better ! " public attitude but the public does n't always blindly buy what companies believe they should , and acceptance of what is a very radical proposition certainly is n't a foregone conclusion			1
there are bound to be claims of " frankenfoods , " and reaction against the work			0
" @entity188 acceptance is n't guaranteed , but we all want meat that 's safer and healthier , " he said			0
" if cultured meat looks , tastes , and costs the same as regular meat , then i think acceptance will be high			0
the more we learn about the health and environmental impact of conventional meat , the more cultured meat looks like a good alternative			2
" one obvious touchstone for how in - vitro - meat will be received by the public is perhaps the way @entity204 crops were -- or were not - accepted around the world , something that @entity21 draws encouragement from			1
" what 's interesting about the @entity204 issue is that it has been controversial in some places , but is a non-issue for most consumers , " he said			0
" most @entity215 are regularly eating @entity204 foods			0
in any case , it 's not necessarily the case that cultured meat would involve @entity204 foods			0
" we all want meat that 's safer and healthier			0
if cultured meat looks , tastes , and costs the same as regular meat , then do we care that it 's produced in a steel tank , rather than in an animal farm ? " take hydroponic vegetables			2
we like the idea that they 're produced in sterile water instead of dirt and manure			0
it 's true that in - vitro meat is n't natural			1
nor for that matter are hydroponic vegetables , or bread , or cheese , or wine			0
raising 10,000 chickens indoors and pumping them full of drugs is n't natural , either , and it is n't healthy or safe			0
the more we learn about how meat is produced now , the more in - vitro meat looks like a better alternative			1
" lab - produced meat also raises some ethical considerations			1
@entity248 , @entity250 campaigner , believes more attention should be paid to improving livestock conditions rather than developing in - vitro meat			1
" at a time when hundreds of small - scale , sustainable farming operations are filing for bankruptcy every day , it is unethical to consider purchasing petri dish meat			2
rather , we should be making it easier and more affordable to raise livestock in a safe , humane and ecologically sensitive manner , " she told @entity0			0
@entity265 , @entity266 spokesperson for @entity74 , thinks that clear parameters for in - vitro development need to put in place : " if we can successfully develop these products , what is the defining line between lab - grown meat and natural animals ? " she told @entity0			1
" that is an especially important question since a high level of differentiation and tissue complexity is required to replicate muscle tissue that we use as meat			0
we need to draw clear lines in order to prevent the commodification of all life			0
" ultimately the success of in - vitro meat may be less about consumer sensibilities and more about the hard realities of feeding a growing global population in a finite world			1
" with @entity292 and @entity293 doubling their meat consumption every decade , there 's no sustainable way to satisfy the growing global appetite for meat without a significant improvement in technology , " said @entity21			1
" cultured meat offers one solution			0
improved plant - based meat substitutes offer another			2
i expect both will be needed			0
" test tube burgers ? it seems you could be eating them sooner than you might expect			0
what do you think of in - vitro meat ? do you think it could be a solution to the problems connected to meat production and climate change ? let us know in the @entity319 box below .			1

*ongoing* research into in - vitro meat ; grown in a lab using animal samples
advocates say in - vitro meat is better for health of humans and environment
lab - made meat could be served in a decade , says research scientist @entity21
