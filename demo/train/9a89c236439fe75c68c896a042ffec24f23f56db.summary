who killed and decapitated an 88 - year - old @entity2 man , and where is his 87 - year - old wife ? @entity6 's death and @entity8 's disappearance are mysteries detectives are trying to unravel -- and fast			1
" we need to assume , or at least pray , that mrs. @entity8 is still alive , and we desperately need to know her whereabouts , " @entity11 sheriff @entity10 said thursday			1
investigators are treating her disappearance as an abduction , he said			0
there is no indication she 's a suspect , and there 's " plenty " to indicate she was taken , he said			0
her pocketbook , cell phone and vehicle were all at the million - dollar waterfront home where her husband 's headless body was found			1
investigators believe @entity6 was killed between last friday and sunday , and they 're still searching for his severed head , @entity10 told reporters , describing the case as " very unusual " and the most frustrating homicide of his career			1
" i do n't think it 's a random incident			0
i think for whatever reason these people were singled out for this , " @entity10 said			0
" they live in the most exclusive neighborhood , or one of the most exclusive neighborhoods , in this county			1
... they 're on a cul - de - sac in a gated , multimillion dollar resort community that we have no crime in			2
" @entity10 said he ca n't recall a burglary in the neighborhood in his 18 years as sheriff			1
the @entity54 ' friends had n't heard from them in days and went to their home in the upscale , gated , lakeside @entity58 community , where they found @entity6 in the garage			1
" i do n't know that that 's the murder scene , but there 's obviously blood , " @entity10 said			0
authorities have searched @entity65 in the vicinity of the @entity54 ' home -- turning up only a lawn chair and a christmas tree -- and sent cadaver dogs into the nearby woods , to no avail , @entity10 said			2
police have also spoken to neighbors , family and friends			1
so far , the investigation has turned up little to shed light on the crimes			0
investigators are n't aware of any enemies the couple had made , or any reason someone would target them , he said			0
" if i had a good , solid lead , guess what ? i would n't be standing here talking to you , " the sheriff told reporters			2
" the only person who 's not a suspect is @entity93 , because i know where i was			0
" ' this has been a shock ' residents described @entity97 -- a tony resort community about 75 miles east of @entity99 , which also boasts a @entity101 signature golf course and a @entity102 -- as a safe enclave where people were comfortable leaving their doors unlocked			2
" there is no crime in this area , no crime whatsoever , " @entity106 told @entity107			0
" nothing has ever happened here before , so this has been a shock to us			0
" added resident @entity117 , " it 's just a total sense of sadness and confusion on how this could happen here -- and obviously a great deal of concern for @entity8 and our prayers and hopes that she will be found			1
" the 3,300 - square - foot home where the @entity54 have lived since 1994 is valued at more than $ 1 million and sits on @entity65 , in the bucolic @entity58 neighborhood of @entity97			1
off a moderately trafficked rural road , a divided , two - lane road lined with trees and a white fence winds through large , green expanses of tall grass , past a guard house into the neighborhood			2
at this point , investigators do n't know whether the suspect or suspects approached the home by land or via the lake			2
@entity10 said it is n't uncommon to see fishermen casting lures in the middle of the night			0
without any clear leads as to @entity8 's whereabouts , he said , investigators are now asking the public for help			1
@entity8 is 5 - foot - 2 and weighs 148 pounds			1
she has gray hair and blue eyes			0
and she is believed to be in danger , @entity10 told local media			2
anyone with more information should call the @entity160 at 706 - 485 - 8557			2
details of the case have baffled investigators			2
" you 've got such unusual circumstances here , " @entity10 said			0
" if it 's an abduction , you would expect some sort of extortion demand			0
if it was an assassination , you 'd think both bodies would be there			0
and then you have , totally , nothing in their background that indicates anything like this , and then the area where it happened is not indicative of any type of homicide			0
" couple was ' sweet as can be ' a @entity183 source confirmed the bureau was conducting @entity6 's autopsy but would n't comment further			1
the @entity186 also is assisting and , likewise , reticent , saying only that it " is providing limited support based on the needs and requests from @entity11 authorities , " according to @entity191 , spokesman for the @entity186 's @entity99 office			0
meanwhile , the sheriff said , rumors have been flying in the small community			1
he told @entity107 earlier thursday that information suggesting authorities had found parts of @entity8 's body were " totally false " and asked @entity107 to " help stop the false reports , as they are interfering with our investigation			1
" little else is known about the couple , both of whom were born in @entity207			0
police and friends are at a loss for why they would be the targets of such violence			1
compounding the mystery is that the home was pristine			2
there is no sign of a break - in , a scuffle or anything missing			2
their vehicles were at the home , police said			1
@entity6 has paid taxes on a 23 - foot boat , which @entity10 said the couple recently sold , and @entity8 reportedly owned fast - food restaurants			1
tax records connect him to a @entity228 and a @entity229 the rev. @entity230 of @entity231 said he has known the couple for about eight years and counts them among his church 's 350 attendees			0
he 's " baffled " as to why anyone would commit such crimes against them , he said , as they were grounded , " beloved in the community " and " sweet as can be			1
" they were active in the church and family - oriented , he said			0
the @entity54 , who have been married 68 years , had three adult children , he said , as well as grandchildren , though he was n't certain how many			0
" number one , we are devastated by @entity6 having died and the violence around that , " @entity230 said			1
" and not knowing what happened to ( @entity8 )			1
... it is dealing with the tragedy of what we do know and the uncertainty of what lies ahead			0
