-- animated movies have topped the box office for the past four weekends , but this time around , audiences were ready to embrace something a bit edgier			2
as such , @entity7 ' horror film " @entity8 " easily topped a crowded weekend with an eye - popping $ 41.5 million			1
the $ 20 million @entity11 - directed title garnered the best horror debut of the year , trumping @entity14 's $ 34.1 million bow in may			1
it also had the second - best debut ever for an r - rated horror film , trailing only @entity18 , which opened with $ 52.6 million in 2011			1
the film notched a powerful $ 14,306 per theater average , and if it receives strong word - of - mouth ( which seems likely ) , it could become a $ 100 million smash			2
audiences , which were 53 percent female and 59 percent above the age of 25 , issued the conjuring an excellent " a- " @entity27 grade — an especially impressive rating given the fact that the horror genre that has seen its fair share of " d " and " f " grades			2
the conjuring 's debut marks a career high for @entity11 , who broke onto the scene in 2004 with his $ 55.2 million hit @entity40 , a film so buzzy it steered horror films into the torture direction for years after its release			1
in 2011 , @entity11 scored a spookier hit with @entity47 , which , like @entity8 , starred @entity49			1
@entity47 earned $ 54 million against a $ 1.5 million budget and now has a sequel hitting theaters on september 13			0
the @entity37 will easily outgross both of those films , though it 's all but guaranteed that @entity11 's next effort , @entity55 , will be his biggest hit yet			0
@entity57 held strong in second place , dipping 43 percent to $ 25.1 million in its third weekend			1
the $ 76 million sequel from @entity60 and @entity61 needed only 17 days to surpass the original @entity57 's $ 251.5 million domestic total			1
today , the film has earned $ 276.2 million			2
overseas , @entity57 has already surpassed the $ 300 million mark , pushing its worldwide total to $ 584.6 million			1
in third place , @entity66 started its box office run at a snail 's pace			1
the $ 135 million animated comedy , featuring the voice of @entity73 as a radioactive snail , grossed $ 21.5 million in its first weekend — the worst debut for a @entity77 film since 2006 ′ s flushed away opened with $ 18.8 million			1
hot on the heels of @entity81 and @entity57 , it 's likely that @entity66 suffered because audiences have had their fill of family fare over the past few weeks			1
fortunately , the crowds that did see @entity66 liked what they saw and gave it an " a " @entity27 grade , which could help word - of - mouth in the future , though there 's almost no chance the film matches its budget domestically			1
@entity66 's lackluster debut casts some shadow on @entity98 and @entity77 's infant relationship			1
earlier this year , @entity98 distributed the @entity100 , its first @entity77 - produced film in a five - year deal between the studios			1
the caveman comedy grossed $ 186 million domestically and $ 582 million worldwide			0
the fact that @entity66 will come nowhere close to those numbers makes its opening all the more disappointing			1
@entity108 fell 52 percent from its first weekend to $ 20 million in its second frame			0
@entity112 's $ 80 million @entity111 comedy continues to perform well despite its critical savaging , and it has now earned $ 79.5 million after ten days			0
grown ups 2 is on track to pass the $ 100 million mark with ease , and it will become @entity111 's 13th live - action comedy to reach that milestone			0
whether you love @entity111 or hate him , you ca n't deny his remarkable box office record			0
in fifth place , @entity122 took in $ 18.5 million , 15 percent less than the original @entity125 's $ 21.8 million opening in 2010			2
the @entity127 sequel starring @entity128 , @entity129 , @entity130 , and @entity131 , got a big budget - boost from its predecessor , but like @entity134 2 , that did n't grow the film 's audience at the box office			2
while @entity125 cost only $ 58 million and ultimately earned $ 199 million worldwide , @entity122 cost $ 85 million , and its weaker @entity141 debut suggests it wo n't climb nearly as high at the box office			2
audiences gave @entity125 2 a " b + " cinemascore grade			0
the @entity37 -- $ 41.5 million 2			0
@entity57 -- $ 25 million 3			1
turbo -- $ 21.5 million 4			0
@entity108 -- $ 20 million 5			0
@entity122 -- $ 18 million further down the chart , @entity148 , in which @entity73 and @entity146 play cops in the afterlife , bombed with $ 12.8 million in its first three days			0
the film also stars @entity130 , which means that both she and @entity73 faced themselves at the box office this weekend — and both fared poorly			2
in press notes sent to journalists this morning , @entity60 admits " in this crowded marketplace , @entity148 did not find the size audience it needed and @entity60 is disappointed in the weekend result			0
" the studio says the action comedy cost $ 130 million ( though its budget has been reported at $ 154 million ) , which makes @entity148 an expensive misfire for the studio that has n't suffered a major misstep since @entity168			0
this year at the box office has been riddled with costly mistakes , and @entity148 joins the ranks of after @entity174 , @entity175 , @entity176 , and @entity173 -- big - budget tentpoles that audiences firmly rejected			2
crowds issued @entity148 a negative " @entity179			0
so for those of you keeping score : @entity66 , @entity122 , and @entity148 collectively cost $ 350 million and earned $ 52.8 million this weekend at the box office			1
the @entity37 , meanwhile , cost $ 20 million and earned $ 41.5 million			0
