-- the year @entity2 turned 11 , she started wearing a turtleneck and long , corduroy pants every day , even in summer			1
for the next two years , that was her uniform			2
she was a long way away from being known as a fashion expert who guts people 's closets			1
at the time , she felt like long sleeves and high necks were her only choice : she had woken up one morning with angry psoriasis scales covering her body from neck to toes			1
it taught her a painful lesson in self - consciousness			1
" when my skin disease was at its worst , i hated the summer sun. i was like @entity21			1
i was like @entity22 , " she said			2
" it was so painful to live with something that there was so little i could do about and at the same time could inflict so much emotional damage			0
it made me feel like a monster			0
" hiding behind clothes and worrying about looks is " not about vanity when it is a question of identity , " @entity30 said			0
" we 're worried about it because we 're worried about what kind of image we 're putting forward , what people are going to think about us			1
" people want to be accepted and respected , approved of and loved			1
" as a fashion expert on @entity44 's " @entity43 , " which starts its final season on august 9 , @entity30 and her colleague @entity46 have seen some tragic attempts to hide what makeover clients see as flaws , whether it 's extra weight around their waist or legs they think should be longer			1
for many , though , it 's skin : chronic conditions such as psoriasis , but also freckles , aging skin , poor circulation , stretch marks , scars and body hair cause skin shame , and make people want to cover up , @entity30 said			1
but how do you dress to suit that ? especially in summer ? " when i was in my 20s , i loved summer clothes , " said @entity69 image consultant @entity68 , from @entity70			1
" i loved wearing short skirts and dresses and showing off my legs			1
and i 'm glad i had that time in my life			0
" now i 'm in my 40s , my skin is aging			1
i do n't enjoy summer clothes , " she said			1
" i do n't like showing off my skin			2
" she joked that she might be a vampire , but had to accept it : " i 'm white , that 's who i am			0
i have really pale skin			2
" atop a bathing suit , she makes sure to add a fabulous hat and some jewelry , maybe even an elegant cover - up , " to make it more of an outfit , " she said			2
as her clients try to hide their arms , knees , legs and even feet , @entity68 's plan is to focus on the positive and adhere to the advice she learned at the @entity97 : show your skinny bits			0
when ankles , wrists , lower arms and calves are exposed in tasteful ways , everyone looks longer and leaner , @entity68 said , while still covering up the parts of their skin that they do n't want to show			1
" i tell clients , ' let 's accentuate what we like , " she said			0
" look in the mirror and focus on one good part			0
i hope everyone can at least do that			0
" clothes used to be the tool @entity30 used to hide her skin , but fashion helped saved her , she said			1
and now she hopes to share the secrets she has learned over the years			0
" when style is at its best , it 's a wonderful source of confidence , " @entity30 said			0
" it becomes a kind of armor			0
" she teamed up up with @entity131 to launch the " @entity133 " campaign this week			0
the website aims to help those with psoriasis , a chronic immune system disease that affects the skin , to feel empowered through fashion advice , empathetic personal testimonies and help finding dermatologists			1
style and beauty products are supposed to help you forget about the parts of your body that you perceive as flaws , @entity30 said , even if only for a little while			0
@entity30 uses makeup , moisturizer and smart fabric choices to combat her skin troubles			2
" these are things that we can do , these little tricks of the trade			0
you put a shiny moisturizer or foundation on your decolletage area , which can get very wrinkly as you get older , more freckly , liver spotty			0
but the more shiny moisturizer you use , the more reflective it is , and you see less of those things			0
" " @entity167 makes a leg foundation that i live by , because for most of my life , my skin has been discolored			2
if i do n't put that on when i 'm wearing a dress , it looks like i am wearing blue stockings instead of skin , " because of poor circulation due to psoriasis			1
she finds ways to make fads work for her , too			0
with longer silhouettes strutted into spring and summer collections , maxi dresses , full midi skirts , floaty @entity188 shorts and even jumpsuits made of tissue - thin cotton are all trendy clothing options that look like deliberate fashion choices , but are in actuality cover - ups , @entity30 said			1
" all of your clothing still has to be chosen with fashion in mind , " she said			2
" look around you so you know what the trends are , not if they 're going to work for you			0
" " as i sit here wearing an @entity207 [ jumpsuit , ] " @entity30 explained , the outfit offers nearly complete body coverage , but because the fabric is cotton and ultra-thin , it 's breathable			2
" very , very easy to wear in the swamp - like weather we 're having now in @entity212 , without having to show a lot of skin , " she said			1
what else will @entity30 be wearing this summer ? " i am all about cotton dresses , " she said			1
" particularly this season i am obsessed with white			0
and one of my favorite companies , @entity219 , makes these beautiful white cotton dresses			0
a bunch of their designs have three - quarter sleeves			2
they 're so whisper - thin , the sleeves do n't feel like you 're in a straight jacket , and you can wear them in the hottest weather			2

summer fashion leads to *anxiety* for people with freckles , poor circulation and other conditions
@entity240 once kept @entity2 wearing only skin - covering turtlenecks and pants
