-- if you loved " @entity2 , " you 're in luck : the sequel , " 22 jump street , " is the exact same movie			1
since the first film was such a fast and fizzy buddy - cop bromance , that 's not the worst news in the world			1
but it is a bit of a disappointment			2
reprising their @entity15 routine , @entity13 and @entity14 play undercover narcs @entity18 and @entity19 , who are assigned to go back to school and pose as students to sniff out a drug ring			1
sound familiar ? only this time , instead of high school , they 're dumped on a college campus , and the drug is a deadly synthetic mix of @entity29 and @entity30 called @entity31			2
'' do the same thing as last time and everyone will be happy , '' their pencil - pushing supervisor ( @entity32 ) tells the fellas at the outset			2
and that 's precisely what they do , beat for beat , for the next two hours			2
to cover up the script 's lack of originality , screenwriters @entity43 , @entity44 , and @entity45 pummel us with a string of self - aware meta - commentary jokes that poke fun at bloated sequels			2
it 's as if they 're trying to beat viewers to the realization that we 're being peddled sloppy seconds			2
but just because the writers repeatedly elbow the audience in the ribs about how cynical sequels are does n't make their approach any less cynical			2
it 's a good thing , then , that @entity13 and @entity14 continue to have such great chemistry			1
@entity13 's neurotic - motormouth act and @entity14 's lovable - lunkhead shtick still shoot giddy sparks			1
after kicking off with a ridiculously over-the - top action - flick sequence , the guys show up at their swanky new hq in an old @entity72 church across the street from their previous digs ( hence the new address in the title )			0
their barking captain , played with hard - a * * menace by @entity79 , informs them that he 's enrolling them at @entity82 , where they 'll pretend to be the most genetically mismatched siblings since @entity85 and @entity86 in " @entity87			0
" adding some supporting - cast spice are comedians @entity89 and @entity91 as a pair of narcoleptically chill identical twins who live across the hall and @entity95 as a sarcastic grump who spews acid insults about how old @entity18 and @entity19 look			0
one of the unexpected treats of the first film was the positioning of the @entity103 - sculpted @entity14 as the unpopular loser and the brainy sack of mashed potatoes @entity13 as the @entity107			1
here , the roles are reversed : @entity14 bros down with some football - stud frat boys , while @entity13 is shunned and forced to hang with an emo crowd that includes a beautiful coed ( @entity113 ) he meets when he does a bonkers poetry - slam number that earns him the ( untimely ) nickname @entity115 ( see sidebar )			1
the spoken - word bit culminates in one of the film 's best moments : a walk - of - shame gag in which @entity13 exchanges embarrassed glances with female classmates making the morning - after walk across the quad			1
the movie could 've used more cracked scenes like that one			1
instead , " @entity135 " lazily milks the undercover brothers ' codependency for gay - panic punchlines ( enough already )			0
they go their separate ways			0
( cue @entity139 's '' missing you			0
'' ) @entity14 then finds a new target for his homoerotic double entendres in the alpha - male quarterback @entity143 , played by @entity144 ( son of @entity146 ) @entity145			1
as the tired investigation spins its wheels to a spring - break climax in @entity151 , the movie nearly morphs into a slack installment in the " @entity157 " franchise , complete with shootouts , chases , and even a fiery helicopter explosion			1
on the plus side , it also gives us more of @entity95 's delirious deadpan misanthropy			0
i do n't want to give the impression that i did n't laugh at times			0
i did â € ” especially during the film 's inspired end - credits tease of future @entity2 installments			1
but i 've come to expect more from directors @entity168 and @entity168 , who have been on a roll with the cult tv series " @entity171 , " the first " @entity2 , " and most recently " the @entity172			0
" the merry - prankster duo have a real knack for cheeky pop culture mischief and placing clever new spins on shopworn properties			0
i get that with sequels , moviegoers are , to some extent , asking to see more of the same			0
but does the same have to feel quite so samey ? grade : b - see the original story at @entity0			0

@entity14 and @entity13 revive their roles
the film is very similar to " @entity192 "
the *similarities* is a running joke in the movie
