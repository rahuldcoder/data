champion @entity1 toasts dream year one such prospect is @entity26 , the 21 - year - old @entity27 test driver who finished second in the 2011 formula renault 3.5 series and has been given the chance to drive @entity7 's imperious @entity31 car			1
despite having an unfamiliar name at the wheel , the results on tuesday bore an uncanny resemblance to those which have been witnessed in the sport for the last two years			2
@entity7 once again left the other teams trailing in their wake , only this time it was @entity41 youngster @entity26 leading the field -- his lap of one minute 40.011 seconds beating @entity45 test driver @entity44 into second place			1

the @entity41 also races for @entity66 in the @entity67 , where he has ended the season third after one victory and five podium finishes			0
the @entity67 has long been a production line for @entity4 talent , with the competition having been the brainchild of former @entity4 commercial rights holder @entity75 and one - time @entity78 boss @entity77			1

" @entity89 's @entity88 is another @entity67 graduate being given his chance to shine , taking to the cockpit for the @entity0 - sponsored @entity92 on tuesday			1

" it 's my dream to drive in @entity4 so i 'm really very thankful for this opportunity , " said @entity88			1
