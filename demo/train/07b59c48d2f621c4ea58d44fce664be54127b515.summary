@entity0 -- use any metaphor you like -- predators smelling blood , invaders storming the castle , a snowball growing in size and momentum as it rolls downhill			0
all describe efforts by opponents of president @entity15 's signature health care reforms to kill the 2010 law after the botched launch of the @entity19 website provided a new opening for attack			1
critics led by conservative republicans target the @entity24 itself , not just the website woes , in hopes of creating a public groundswell of opposition			1
" @entity24 is much more than a bad website ; it 's a bad law , " says a @entity32 @entity31 playbook for @entity31 members to follow in the campaign			1
the document obtained from a @entity31 source thursday by @entity1 lays out a strategy of talking points , videos , op - eds and social media outreach intended to spread as negative a perception of the health care reforms as far and wide as possible			1
@entity15 regularly complains about such search - and - destroy tactics , telling business leaders tuesday that " one of the problems we 've had is one side of @entity51 is invested in failure			0
" @entity32 spokesman @entity53 said thursday that the @entity31 playbook lacked " a single word devoted to helping constituents enroll or offering an alternative idea to help @entity58 gain access to qualify , affordable care			1
" " this is a partisan political strategy that has n't worked in the past , and it 's not going to work now , " he said			0
for @entity31 , the goal is to bolster @entity31 prospects in next year 's congressional elections by vilifying the health care reforms and making them the main campaign issue			1
holding their @entity32 majority and winning back the @entity71 from @entity73 control next year would increase leverage for weakening and perhaps even dismantling the reforms they despise as government overreach run amok			1
president and @entity24 sink to new polling lows at every opportunity , @entity31 leaders cite effects so far -- including canceled policies , higher premiums and limited options for some -- as evidence that the dysfunctional website merely foreshadowed what they call an incurably flawed law			1
when the @entity24 passed with no @entity31 votes more than three years ago , " reasonable minds perhaps could have differed on whether @entity24 would work , " sen. @entity92 of @entity93 told @entity1 on wednesday			1
" today , that 's not possible , " said @entity92 , the @entity97 favorite who spearheaded the @entity31 fight against the reforms that led to the 16 - day government shutdown in october			1
" in my view , coming together to stop @entity24 is the essence of pragmatism because it is self - evident this is n't working			2
" keeping the pressure up @entity92 and his @entity31 colleagues plan to maintain that focus			2
the @entity31 - led @entity111 will hold " field hearings " in four states in coming weeks that will focus on consumer complaints about @entity24			1
friday 's initial event in @entity116 is titled " @entity117 : sticker shock of @entity119			0
" in particular , @entity31 opponents lambast @entity15 for his " if you like your policy , you can keep your policy " pledge of past years that proved untrue for what could amount to several million @entity58 who bought their own insurance instead of getting coverage through employers or government programs			2
while affecting less than 5 % of the population , the cancellation notices to individual policyholders became a symbol of oversell by the president and @entity73 that @entity31 now exploit by citing public mistrust in the government			2
the 17 - page @entity32 @entity31 playbook obtained by @entity1 includes specific instructions for legislators to solicit personal stories from people losing policies or forced to pay more under @entity24			1
" in this playbook , you 'll find messaging tools to help you communicate in your district about the disastrous @entity24 rollout , " it says			1
talking points in the document cite information from the @entity153 that stress worst - case scenarios predicted so far , such as at least 7 million @entity58 losing employer - provided health insurance in coming years because of the reforms			1
@entity157 fliers the playbook provides quote television comedians joking about the dysfunction of the @entity19 website when it launched on october 1			2
it is all designed to create a perception of total public rejection of the health care reforms to pile on recent polls that show already shaky support for @entity24 declining further , along with support for the president			2
@entity15 accepted responsibility for the dysfunctional website that stymied the october 1 launch of the vital new insurance exchanges for people to shop for coverage , as well as the failure of the reforms to better protect individual policy holders getting cancellation notices			2
he framed the issue as facing expected challenges in trying to reform a failing health insurance system that left more than 40 million people without coverage and millions more lacking adequate policies			0
" there have been times where i thought we were kind of , you know , slapped around a little bit unjustly			0
this one 's deserved , right ? it 's on us , " @entity15 told reporters last week			0
" but , we ca n't lose sight of the fact that the status quo before the @entity24 was not working at all			2
" presidents and @entity73 : what 's your counterproposal ? the president and @entity73 complain that @entity31 intent on eliminating @entity24 lack any serious proposals to help the uninsured get coverage and address the broader problem of bringing down overall health care costs , a goal of the reforms			1
in a report released wednesday by @entity213 , @entity15 's new head of the @entity214 , the administration claimed health care spending from 2010 to 2013 grew at the lowest rate on record since 1965			0
while @entity32 @entity31 have voted more than 40 times to repeal or otherwise undermine @entity24 , specific @entity31 proposals offer limited approaches , such as allowing insurers to offer health policies across state borders			1
in addition , @entity31 leaders do n't mention benefits of the reforms such as ending denial of coverage for pre-existing conditions as well as limits on total benefits			2
instead , they frame their stand as protecting consumers facing higher costs and forced changes by the overhaul			0
bad news for woman cited as @entity24 success story " we 're going to continue to do oversight so that we understand exactly what 's happening out there			1
our members are going to continue to collect stories , " house speaker @entity245 told reporters tuesday , adding that there was " no decision " on specific steps @entity31 might take			2
" but we 're going to do everything we can to try to protect the @entity58 people from this awful law			0
" for his part , @entity15 also says the goal is to protect @entity58 , with the reforms providing coverage to people previously unable to afford it or determined ineligible by insurers to get it			0
he emphasizes in every public pronouncement on the reforms that they already have ended denial of coverage for pre-existing conditions , provided free preventive screening for millions , eliminated caps on total benefits and brought other much - needed changes for consumers			0
" i 'm not going to walk away from 40 million people who have the chance to get health insurance for the first time , " the president said last week			0
" and i 'm not going to walk away from something that has helped the cost of health care grow at its slowest rate in 50 years			0
" shoring up the @entity19 website for now , the administration continues work to get the @entity19 website functioning well enough by the end of november for most users to complete the enrollment process in a timely manner			0
the enrollment period extends until march 31 , and officials believe there will be time to reach the goal of about 7 million enrolled by then to make the new exchanges economically viable			0
blocked out at @entity294 ? bypass on way soon , feds say democrats , including @entity15 administration officials , concede that failure to get the website working properly soon will mean major trouble for the reform law			0
for now , they declare their support for @entity24 , setting it up as a crucial campaign issue in 2014			0
" while @entity31 continue to fixate on sabotaging health reform and root for failure , @entity32 @entity73 will continue to stand tall in support of the @entity24 , work to strengthen the health reform law as implementation continues , and ensure that millions of uninsured @entity58 get coverage , " said a statement thursday by @entity306 , a spokesman for @entity308 @entity307			1
the @entity316 already is taking up the challenge			0
@entity316 chairman @entity318 held a news conference thursday to assert that @entity73 candidates were more likely to shun the health care reforms than embrace them			0
" it looks like any @entity323 in a serious reelection fight is neither eager nor proud to run on @entity24 , " @entity318 said , adding that opposing the reforms was " nothing to be ashamed of " and that he was " proud to take the position that we are against @entity24 , that we want to repeal @entity24 , and that it 's bad for @entity58			1
" battle for the @entity32 in 2014 : obamacare vs. shutdown @entity1 's @entity331 and @entity332 contributed to this report .			1
