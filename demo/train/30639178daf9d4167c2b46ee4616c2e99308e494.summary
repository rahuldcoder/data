@entity0 , @entity3 politics rarely surprises			2
but monday 's agreement between @entity8 and @entity10 leader @entity9 did precisely that			1
in a pre-emptive strike -- against his critics , a cynical @entity3 press , and , last but not least , an @entity17 administration that keeps hoping he 's a short - timer -- @entity8 bought himself another 16 months of challenge - free politics , co-opted his main opponent for the price of a deputy premiership , and broadened and legitimized his government for the turbulent period ahead			1
while @entity9 looks unprincipled ( two weeks ago he said he 'd never join a @entity8 - led coalition ) , @entity8 looks like a veritable statesman and political genius who , for the sake of the country 's unity and stability , did the right thing			1
with @entity17 president @entity32 facing an uncertain political future , @entity8 has secured his -- at least over the short term			0
what difference will the new coalition of 94 @entity37 members -- a virtually unassailable majority -- have on the core issues facing @entity3 ? peace process : already comatose , the @entity3 - @entity43 issue may be revived slightly as a result of the new politics			1
@entity9 has made resolution of the @entity43 issue a key theme ; but the result will be motion without real movement			0
since @entity9 is committed to pursuing the existing government 's policies until the end of 2013 , it 's unlikely there will be major changes			0
@entity8 did n't invite @entity10 into the coalition only to go to new elections over a deal with the @entity43 that could split his own @entity61 party			1
but the change in tone will relieve the pressure of being saddled with a right - wing government that many claimed had no constituent group which was at all interested in negotiations			0
@entity69 : some analysts argue that early elections would have reduced the chances for an @entity3 strike against @entity69 nuclear sites , and that the unity government has now increased them			1
that 's what @entity8 would like to make the world believe			2
but @entity8 's decision - making on striking @entity69 has always been shaped by three factors ; the unity government changes none of them			1
in fact , given @entity9 's caution on @entity69 , the odds of a strike before the @entity17 elections may actually be reduced			2
first , there 's @entity8 's read of @entity69 's intentions			1
@entity8 believes the mullahs want the capacity to produce a nuclear weapon and ultimately to possess the weapon itself			2
the @entity97 international talks on @entity69 , in @entity98 last month and later this month in @entity99 , have n't persuaded him otherwise ; but they do make an attack much less likely while the process is in train			1
second , there 's the degree of difficulty of the operation			0
@entity3 would like to avoid a unilateral strike and make @entity69 @entity17 's problem			1
without firing a shot in the past year or so , the @entity3 are well on their way to success here			0
and @entity9 will reinforce this approach now that his bloc of 28 @entity37 members is part of the coalition			0
finally , what @entity17 thinks is critical to @entity3 calculations			0
should the @entity3 strike , the @entity17 needs to be in their corner to deal with the mess afterward			2
and @entity32 has made it as clear as any @entity17 president can that @entity3 acting now , with negotiations ongoing , is a bad idea			0
clearly , @entity32 does n't want an @entity3 strike or an @entity17 strike before the elections and probably not this year			2
and the new unity government reinforces the obvious : no war with @entity69 in 2012 and likely no deal on the nuclear issue either			1
this new government in @entity3 is n't about upsetting the status quo and getting ready for war ; on the contrary , it 's about preserving the status quo -- at least for now			1
@entity8 thinks of himself in historic and potentially transformative terms -- leading @entity3 at a moment of great challenge , particularly freeing the @entity3 from the shadow of the @entity69 bomb			1
we 're constantly underestimating him			0
@entity32 thinks he 's a con man , or at best a speed bump confronting a peace process he 'd like to see move forward			2
the @entity146 would like him gone -- yesterday			0
the @entity43 and the @entity147 ca n't stand him			0
but the fact is , for now @entity8 is the only @entity3 political leader that can do and have it all -- maintain close ties with @entity0 ; settle the @entity152 ; avoid negotiations with the @entity43 ; use the threat of an @entity3 attack to keep the international community pressing @entity69 ; and now , dominate @entity3 politics			1
he 's the king of @entity3 , and we may just have to get used to it			0
join us on @entity161 / @entity160			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity164 .			0

@entity8 *expanded* his coalition with addition of @entity10 party
@entity164 says the move strengthens @entity8 's hand politically
he say it likely *signals* @entity3 will not attack @entity69 's nuclear *facilities* for now
@entity164 : the government may talk more about peace but a deal is n't likely
