-- for more than 20 years , actress @entity1 has kept audiences laughing			1
" it does n't feel the same , and it 's hard to carry your purse , " @entity1 says			1
" i cry at least once a day			2
" during her teenage years , she lit up the small screen as @entity8 on the hit sitcom " @entity10			2
" after 11 hilarious seasons , @entity1 's career branched out to the big screen and @entity14			1
in 2007 , @entity1 landed the starring role on " @entity16 ? " an acclaimed comedy series			1
after receiving @entity19 and @entity21 nominations for her performance , it seemed that nothing could stop @entity1 's triumphant return to tv			1
then , in april 2008 , shocking news silenced the laughter			2
at 36 years old , @entity1 was diagnosed with breast cancer			1
at first , @entity1 says she lived quietly with the disease			1
" it 's hard to live quietly , " she says			0
" i went through five weeks of work without telling anyone that this was going on in my life			2
" now , @entity1 is going public with her personal battle to raise awareness among young women who may not think they 're at risk			1
as the daughter of a breast cancer survivor , @entity1 says she 's been vigilant about getting regular mammograms since she was 30 years old			1
in 2007 , doctors recommended extra precautions			0
" my doctor said that the mammograms were n't enough for me because of the denseness of my breasts , " she says			2
" he suggested that i get an mri			0
" @entity1 went in for her first @entity49 screening , which produced disturbing results			1
" they found some funky things going on [ in one breast ] , " she says			2
doctors told her they needed to perform a biopsy			0
then , the excruciating waiting game began			0
@entity1 continued to work and promote her sitcom , but the impending results were never far from her mind			1
a week later she says she got the phone call every woman dreads			0
" [ the doctor said ] , ' it came back positive , ' " she says			2
" right now i 'm sitting here shaking remembering that moment			0
" doctors explained that the cancer was only in her left breast , and thankfully , they caught it at an early stage			1
@entity1 says she held back her tears and immediately went into survival mode			1
the day after her diagnosis , @entity1 says she went in to see an oncologist and a surgeon			1
" i 'm a @entity76 , " she says			0
" we need things done now			0
so , for me , i had to get in now , and i wanted to have my surgery now			0
" within a week , @entity1 had her first lumpectomy			1
doctors also did a biopsy of her lymph nodes to make sure the cancer had n't spread			2
since the cancer was caught early on , @entity1 was told she 'd need six weeks of radiation instead of chemotherapy			1
then , she received more life - changing news			2
a test for the brca gene -- also known as the " breast cancer gene " -- came back positive			1
@entity0 : should you get tested for the gene ? " that sort of changed everything for me , " she says			2
" @entity98 was something temporary , and it was n't addressing the issue of this coming back or the chance of it coming back in my left breast			2
i sort of had to kind of weigh all my options at that point			0
" @entity1 was given two options ... go forward with the radiation treatments and continue testing for the rest of her life or have both breasts removed			1
@entity1 made the dramatic decision to have a bilateral mastectomy			1
" it came on really fast			0
it was one of those things that i woke up and it felt so right , " she says			0
" it just seemed like , ' i do n't want to have to deal with this again			0
i do n't want to keep putting that stuff in my body			0
i just want to be done with this			0
' & i was just going to let them go			0
" before she went in for her surgery , @entity1 says she staged her first -- and last -- nude photo shoot			1
" i made sure that i have close - up photographs of them from every angle so i can kind of remember them , " she says			0
@entity1 's tears finally spilled over the day she met her surgeon			1
" i met with my doctor , and i told him that was my decision , " she says			2
" he brought the surgeon in , and it was like it was the floodgates just opened up and i lost it			0
" @entity0 : going through a double mastectomy surgery in july 2008 , @entity1 went through with the surgery , which has left physical and emotional scars			1
" it can be very painful , " she says			0
" it 's also a part of you that 's gone , so you go through a grieving process and a mourning process			0
" before she went under the knife , @entity1 says the only mastectomy she 'd ever seen was the one her mother received			1
" [ her surgery ] was in the ' 70s , and they did n't do a very good job back then , " she says			0
" so in my own mind i 'm thinking , ' my @entity153 , i 'm going to be butchered , and it 's going to be horrible			0
i 'm never going to love that part of me again			0
' & but i did a lot of research , and they can make some pretty boobies			0
" currently , @entity1 says she has saline expanders in her body , which will make way for the new implants			1
though she 's proud of her proactive decision , she says she 's reminded of her loss every day			2
" it does n't feel the same , and it 's hard to carry your purse , " she says			0
" i cry at least once a day about it because it 's hard to overlook it when you 're standing there in the mirror			0
when you look down , it 's the first thing you see ... so you 're reminded constantly of this thing -- this cancer thing that you had			1
" on the bright side , @entity1 says she wo n't have to wear a bra ever again			1
she also feels victorious in the fight against breast cancer			1
" i have taken a very progressive stance in the rest of my life , " she says			1
" for that , i 'm really grateful			0
" days after her diagnosis , @entity1 says she reached out to family and friends , including @entity190 , a @entity191 winner and breast cancer survivor			1
@entity190 shared the lessons she learned during the fight for her own life			2
" the first thing she said to me is : ' @entity1 , this is a blessing that 's happened to you in your life			1
right now , you get to start over , and right now you get to change everything -- the way that you deal with things in life , the way that you react to things			1
this is the time that you have this opportunity to change the way you eat ... everything you do , ' " @entity1 says			1
@entity1 now looks at her health scare as a blessing			1
" i am a 36 - year - old person with breast cancer , and not many people know that that happens to women my age or women in their 20s , " she says			1
" this is my opportunity now to go out and fight as hard as i can for early detection			0
" as she 's learned , early detection may not come from a mammogram			0
@entity1 says she will fight for women to have access to mris and genetic testing , which many insurance companies wo n't pay for			2
@entity1 says her health scare has shifted her priorities completely			2
" [ there 's ] this need and this desire to make every single day count , " she says			0
" i used to say ... ' do n't sweat the small stuff -- not even the big stuff			2
' at the end of the day , none of it matters but your own joy , your own spiritual journey that you go on , @entity153 , your loved ones , your friends , your animals			0
these are the things you 've got to cherish and love and embrace			0
