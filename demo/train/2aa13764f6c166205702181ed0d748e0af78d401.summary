president @entity1 's chief anti-isis coalition envoy , retired gen. @entity2 , arrived thursday in @entity3 , where it will be up to him to convince the @entity7 government to take more decisive action against the terrorist group			1
" the events of last week have made it clear that urgent and rapid steps are needed to halt [ @entity13 ' ] military capabilities , " @entity16 spokeswoman @entity15 said , " and gen. @entity2 and [ diplomat @entity18 will make that clear in their meetings with @entity7 officials			1
" within the @entity23 there is growing frustration with the @entity7 , whose participation in the @entity23 - led coalition is vital			1
but they have been slow to respond to @entity13 advances just beyond their southern border			2
@entity13 is fighting to take the @entity31 town of @entity32 , a predominantly @entity34 town just steps from @entity7			1
in recent days , the @entity23 has ramped up its airstrikes in the area , but without combat boots on the ground -- something the @entity1 administration is unwilling to commit -- the air campaign is unlikely to keep the town from falling into @entity13 hands			1
the @entity23 hopes @entity7 troops could help turn the tide			2
the @entity46 greenlit military action against @entity13 last week , and they already have tanks and troops along the border			2
so far , those troops are hanging back			0
" we want to see them be helpful , " @entity52 spokesman rear adm. @entity51 said wednesday			0
" we know they have information and capabilities militarily that we just do n't have , because they 're there			0
" for his part , secretary of state @entity62 said he expects @entity7 's role in the coalition to become clearer after @entity2 's meetings			1
" he is going to have long meetings through [ thursday ] and friday which we hope to determine exactly how @entity7 will now enter this having resolved their hostage crisis , " @entity62 told reporters			2
" clearly , on their border -- this is of enormous concern to @entity7 and they recognize that			0
" but foreign minister @entity80 said thursday it 's not " realistic " for the world to expect @entity7 to launch a ground operation against @entity13 alone but that , " once we reach a joint decision @entity7 will continue to act and do its utmost			1
" prime minister @entity87 says it 's the @entity23 that must do more			2
in an interview with @entity91 's @entity90 , @entity87 said the @entity23 must be willing to expand its role in @entity31 to take on the @entity94 regime , as well as extremist groups such as @entity13 " we are ready to do everything if there is a clear strategy that after @entity13 , we can be sure that our border will be protected , " he said			1
" we do n't want the regime anymore on our border pushing people against -- towards @entity7			0
" in other words , @entity7 is willing to help fight @entity13 , if the @entity23 can make certain commitments			1
@entity7 willing to put troops in @entity31 " if others do their part " " the @entity7 could make a tremendous difference , " former @entity23 ambassador to @entity110 @entity109 tells @entity91			2
" what they 're trying to do is to leverage their extraordinary geographic , military and political position -- and it is unique in the @entity116 -- to get the @entity23 to sign up more aggressively " against @entity94			0
negotiating with @entity117 @entity7 also is holding out for help in creating a buffer zone to ward off the @entity31 air force and protect refugees teaming into camps along the border			0
the @entity1 administration has long resisted that proposal , though the window seemed to open a bit on wednesday , when @entity62 said it was " worth looking at very , very closely			0
" but @entity7 's strategy of holding out for concessions is not without risk			1
" if [ @entity32 ] falls that will be a dramatic development , " said @entity109 , " and it will of course expose @entity7 to 500 miles of @entity13 - controlled territory on its southern boundary			2
they do n't want that			0
" and as the negotiations with @entity117 unfold , @entity7 is also feeling internal pressure			0
@entity142 , closely aligned with @entity142 in @entity31 , are desperate to see their government take action			0
the @entity7 government and @entity34 separatist parties recently opened the door for negotiations after decades of fighting			0
now , the crisis in @entity32 and the governments perceived inaction threaten to derail that progress and reignite violence inside @entity7			0
thousands have taken to the streets of @entity7 to protest their government 's reluctance to act in @entity32			2
on thursday , some of those protests turned violent , leading to the deaths of at least 24 people , according to the country 's semi-official news agency , @entity163			0
meanwhile , @entity7 's main opposition party said it will back a motion to authorize ground operations as long as they are limited to rescuing @entity32 and repelling @entity13 , @entity163 also reported			1
despite mounting frustration with its coalition ally , the @entity23 can not afford to lose @entity7 as an ally in the fight against @entity13			1
@entity7 's key geography their location makes them a key regional partner , and the @entity23 needs @entity7 to cut off the flow of foreign fighters into @entity31 , most of whom enter by crossing the @entity7 border			1
the @entity23 also needs the @entity7 government to crack down on black market sales of illegal oil , a main funding source for @entity13 ' activities			1
these issues are all on the table as @entity2 meets with @entity7 officials over the next two days .			0

a special @entity23 envoy is in @entity7 to wrangle more support for the fight against @entity13
@entity7 's geography makes it a key partner for the @entity23
it wants to receive some concessions during talks
