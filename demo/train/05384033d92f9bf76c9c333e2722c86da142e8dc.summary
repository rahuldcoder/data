-- the official tally of last month 's presidential election is almost complete , and one pivotal piece of electoral data -- voter turnout -- will be lower than officials have previously claimed			1
the turnout matters as it may reflect how much trust the @entity10 placed in an election during a political crisis pitting the country 's de facto government against the nation 's ousted president			1
according to @entity10 ' @entity18 and interviews with the electoral officials , with 99.8 percent of the votes counted , 2,298,080 people participated in the november 29 election			1
this represents a 50 percent voter turnout , a figure much lower than the 61 percent officially estimated by the electoral tribunal on election day , and lower than revised turnout figures that the @entity18 gave to @entity0 as recently as december 5			1
the crisis , which escalated after president @entity30 was ousted in a coup last june , has split the international community now that a new president has been elected			1
some countries , such as the @entity35 , @entity36 and @entity37 , have said they will recognize president - elect @entity38			1
others , such as @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity42 , have said they will not			0
other nations have indicated that the turnout figure will be an important indicator in determining whether they will recognize the legitimacy of the election			1
to date , the tribunal , known as @entity50 by its @entity52 acronym , has only released one official press release regarding the vote count			0
that statement , made on election day , cites a 61 percent voter turnout rate and says 2.8 million people cast votes			1
when @entity0 made its own analysis earlier this month , @entity50 spokesman @entity60 said that about 2.6 million votes were cast			0
this downward revision turned out to be overly optimistic as well			0
" there was clearly an effort to get out early vote results as robustly as possibly and convince the international community that the elections were legitimate , " @entity64 , senior director of policy at the @entity66 and @entity67 , told @entity0			0
but @entity60 said that the electoral tribunal has not purposefully tried to put out inflated numbers			1
" that was a projection that reflected the data at the moment , " he said , referring to the data in the first press release and the data given to @entity0			0
a consultant to the @entity50 who has participated on the official vote count disagreed			0
" they gave out those numbers without any substantive evidence , " said the consultant , who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was fearful of jeopardizing his position			2
" there was no substantive methodology behind their projections			0
" estimates from @entity50 were higher than the patterns the statisticians were seeing because there was political pressure for the election to be considered legitimate and successful , the consultant said			0
@entity60 said that the @entity50 's estimates of 2.8 million and 2.6 million votes cast were " based on what we expected			0
the number could be a little erroneous , but it was based on the data at the time			0
" the electoral body has n't put out any further updates to its original 61 percent voter turnout prediction to avoid confusion , he said			1
another official press release is not expected until after all the votes are tabulated and all disputes in smaller races settled , @entity60 said			0
a 50 percent turnout would mean that fewer voters participated than in the last presidential race , in 2005 , where turnout was 55 percent , according to @entity50 data			2
but it also follows a trend of declining turnout since 1997			2
" even the adjusted numbers are not significantly different from the patterns of past elections , " @entity64 said			2
a turnout of under 40 percent may have jeopardized the international acceptance of the election , but the actual turnout rate is still significant enough to be considered legitimate , he said			2
other indicators that could shed light on whether @entity30 's calls for a boycott were heeded , such as the number of spoiled or blank ballots , are not significantly different than in the last election , @entity50 data shows .			1
