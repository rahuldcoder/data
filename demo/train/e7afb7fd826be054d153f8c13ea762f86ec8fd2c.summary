@entity1 lawmakers took a big step tuesday toward legalizing same - sex marriage , an issue that has prompted widespread rebellion within prime minister @entity7 's @entity6			1
in a 400 - 175 vote , mps approved the second reading of a bill legalizing such marriage , indicating a significant majority of members support the measure			1
however , it must go through several more stages before it can become law			1
the bill faces another vote in the @entity21 and a vote in the @entity23			1
before tuesday 's vote , three top party members appealed to conservative mps to get behind the controversial legislation in a letter published in the @entity30 newspaper			1
the letter , signed by chancellor @entity32 , foreign secretary @entity33 and home secretary @entity34 , said that passing the bill is " the right thing to do at the right time			1
" the institution of marriage has evolved over time , the letter said , while " attitudes towards gay people have changed			0
" in a direct appeal to fellow party members , the trio added : " we believe that opening it up to same - sex couples will strengthen , not weaken , the institution			1
as @entity7 has said , we should support gay marriage not in spite of being conservatives , but because we are conservatives			1
" same - sex marriage around the world their attitude was echoed by @entity57 , a @entity58 mp , during debate			2
tuesday 's reading was the first opportunity for lawmakers in the @entity21 to debate the bill in detail			2
" by recognizing and extending the definition of marriage to reflect today 's greater openness towards , and recognition of , same - sex relationships , the legislation does not weaken the institution of marriage			2
on the contrary , it takes it forward , it strengthens it			0
it helps to perpetuate it , " she said			0
the legislation passed the @entity21 with the support of lawmakers from @entity58 and the @entity83			0
the latter are in a coalition government with the conservatives			0
as drafted , the bill would enable religious organizations to choose to conduct same - sex marriages if they wish and includes provisions intended to make sure no religious organization or person is forced to do so			1
the @entity93 is among the religious bodies opposed to the legislation			0
the bill would also allow same - sex couples to convert a civil partnership to a marriage and enable married transsexual people to gain legal recognition in their acquired gender without having to end their marriages			1
a law recognizing civil partnerships in @entity106 and @entity107 was passed in 2004			2
@entity108 and @entity109 , who are already same - sex civil partners and have five children together , told @entity112 that it was important to them to be able to marry in front of their fellow churchgoers			2
" we want to be able to go into our local parish church , where we are practicing @entity120 , and under the eyes of the @entity122 , get married , " said @entity109			0
" i do n't want to go in front of a vicar or priest who does n't want to do it ; it 's supposed to be the happiest day of my life			0
i want to be really happy and joyous when i get married to the man that i 've been together with for 25 years			0
" his partner , @entity108 , said it was a question of equality			0
" marriage is all about the union of two people that love each other and want to bind that love in a relationship that lasts forever			0
and for me , it 's about having that right for everybody , gay , straight or bisexual , " he said			0
" whatever you are , if you love that person , then you should have the rights to be joined in matrimony with them			0
" @entity7 has said he is determined to push through legislation allowing same - sex marriage " not only as someone who believes in equality but as someone who believes passionately in marriage			1
" priests in same - sex relationships may become @entity93 bishops but his commitment to that aim has set him at odds with many in his own party			2
a number of local party members wrote to the prime minister sunday , urging him to reconsider			1
" we feel very strongly that the decision to bring this @entity170 before @entity171 has been made without adequate debate or consultation with either the membership of the @entity6 or with the country at large , " said the letter , published on the @entity167 website			1
" long - held religious and personal freedoms and the right to free speech will be adversely affected by the passing of this @entity170			2
" the @entity93 also outlined its objections to the bill in a briefing note sent to lawmakers friday			2
it can not support the legislation " because of its concern for the uncertain and unforeseen consequences for wider society and the common good when marriage is redefined in gender - neutral terms , " it said			2
it also argues that civil partnerships " already confer the same rights as marriage " and that allowing same - sex couples to marry will open the door to " continued legal disputes for years to come			0
" the issue of same - sex marriage has also prompted wide disagreement elsewhere			1
lawmakers in @entity202 's lower house of parliament , the @entity201 , on saturday passed with a wide majority the most important article of a law to legalize same - sex marriage			1
debate will continue for the next week on thousands of proposed amendments to the law , which would also open adoption to same - sex couples			1
the vote by @entity202 lawmakers followed big public protests against the bill , which has proved highly divisive in the majority @entity218 country			1
in the @entity221 , where president @entity222 has voiced his personal support for same - sex marriage , it has been legalized in nine states and the @entity226			0
at the same time , 30 states have passed constitutional amendments banning same - sex marriage , according to the @entity230			0
