-- @entity1 arrived in @entity2 as a @entity4 girl , but she returned home as a @entity6			1
as a foreign exchange student in college , she spent six months living with a family in @entity10 : an elegant couple she dubbed @entity12 and @entity13			1
@entity14 observed them carefully , took part in their everyday rituals and delighted in the experience			1
" before i lived in @entity10 , i would go through life on autopilot , " said @entity14 , who writes the @entity21 blog and is the author of the new book , " lessons from @entity25 : the top 20 things i learned while living in @entity10			1
" " @entity10 taught me not how to just exist , but to thrive and make every small moment meaningful			1
" here are five of the lessons @entity14 learned in the " @entity10			1
live a passionate life @entity14 noticed that @entity33 often turned mundane aspects of everyday life into something special			1
" for example , every night after dinner we would have a cheese course and every night we would have camembert because it was @entity42 's favorite cheese			2
and every night without exception , before we cut a slice of @entity40 for everyone , he would proclaim it to be the ' @entity48 ' -- or the king of all cheeses , " @entity14 recalled			1
" he did it with passion			0
they turn the smallest things , the smallest rituals and they make them passionate events			1
" @entity58 was a great example because every night of the week , whether it was a wednesday or a friday , it would be an experience that included a three - course meal and lively conversation , @entity14 said			1
afterward , the family would listen to classical music			2
" they never sat in front of the television with a box of pizza and zoned out , never , " @entity14 said			1
the joys of slowly savoring @entity10 2			1
cultivate an air of mystery @entity14 thinks the @entity2 get a bad rap for coming across as cold and aloof when they 're simply very picky about who they open up to and how much they reveal about themselves			1
" i think we can learn a lot from this , " @entity14 said			1
" i would attend at least two dinner parties a week when i was there ... and i would n't really ( know a lot about ) the guests			0
i would n't know what they did for a living , but yet i would know the best book they read recently or the most interesting film they saw or the art exhibit that they went to			2
they loved to discuss these areas of life but they do n't overshare details about their personal lives			2
" it 's considered rude in @entity2 to ask someone what they do for a living , @entity14 said , so when she returned to the @entity106 she stopped asking new acquaintances this question and liked the way it fueled her wonder about them			1
she also discovered that staying mum can be " delicious			0
" " being ok with silence is important			2
i think a lot of people are afraid of silence in conversations , i know i am , " @entity14 said			1
" @entity2 people are very ok with silence			2
you can see this in a lot of @entity2 films -- there 's lots of silent pauses in @entity2 films that you do n't get in @entity106 films			0
look presentable always madame @entity13 would n't even go to the corner store to get a baguette without applying lipstick and tying a scarf around her neck , @entity14 recalled			1
looking presentable was a way of honoring the people she came in contact with everyday			1
" this is n't to be confused with being high maintenance , " @entity14 said			1
" she would n't spend an hour in the bathroom flat - ironing her hair and applying meticulous makeup			0
she had a very quick ( routine ) : ' le no makeup look ' and a very easy hairstyle to follow			0
her 10 - item wardrobe allowed her to pick something really easily			0
she would n't agonize over what clothes to wear every day like so many of us do			0
" @entity14 also noticed the family would routinely wear their best clothes for everyday occasions , a lesson she took to heart			1
" it 's funny , we 'll go and spend money on beautiful clothes and we wo n't wear them			0
we 'll be saving them for some unknown occasion in the future because we do n't want to ruin them , " @entity14 said			2
" we should use these clothes on a daily basis			0
why not use our best ? i think you should never save your best clothes for later			0
use your best now and get rid of anything that is n't up to par. " 4			0
do n't forget the simple pleasures ( and do not deprive yourself ) @entity14 thought the movie " @entity179 " showed off this lesson perfectly as it introduced its whimsical characters and their little pleasures			2
" for some of them it 's cleaning out their handbag , and for some of them it 's breaking the crust on a crème brulee with a spoon , " @entity14 said			2
" these are things that a lot of us just mow over in life and do n't even notice			2
" she observed that @entity197 took great pleasure in making her own preserves or baking a strawberry tart , while @entity13 always looked forward to eating his favorite cheese every evening			0
@entity202 was a big part of life in @entity10 , but @entity14 was amazed to find that she did n't gain any weight			1
she attributes this paradox to lots of walking , little tv watching and no snacking			0
" there were no snack foods in the house and i just did not snack the entire time i was there			0
so when i went to meals , i was hungry , " @entity14 recalled			2
" but the meals were long , drawn - out affairs so i was n't scarfing down this decadent food			0
i was sitting at dinner and we were having conversation			0
the meal would take about an hour and i would eat mindfully , so i would n't overeat			0
" i had dessert at least twice a day			0
i had it every day after dinner , and for tea every afternoon , i would get a crepe or something in the city			0
and i enjoyed my food			0
make life a formal affair @entity14 was impressed by the formal manner in which her host family lived			1
they were always elegantly dressed , their apartment was beautifully furnished and they maintained graceful rituals			0
as a visitor to their home , for example , @entity14 was considered the female guest of honor and was always served first at dinner , ahead of her host and hostess and their son			2
" they just observed these formal protocols and manners and etiquette were very important to them , " @entity14 said			1
" they used their best china and their best crystal on a regular basis			0
... they used the nicest things that they had on a daily basis and it elevated every experience that we had			0
