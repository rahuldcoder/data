are you ready for the " most honest conversation you 'll ever have ? " that 's how @entity4 describes itself -- an apparently troll - proof website for women to discuss everything from politics to their sex lives , all without fear of garnering online abuse			1
while four in 10 internet users have been harassed online , according to the @entity15 , young women suffer the brunt of more extreme abuse -- 26 % have been stalked online , and 25 % sexually harassed			1
now @entity18 , a former @entity19 , @entity20 , and @entity21 video executive , thinks she might have the answer to keeping trolls at bay			1
her new social network filters out what she describes as " @entity28 " language			1
" our definition of ' troll ' is all about rude , hateful , mean , and unproductive comments , " explained @entity18			1
" and these comments can come from men and women			1
" in the @entity38 world , users are verified through their @entity19 , @entity40 , and @entity41 accounts -- though they still have the option of commenting under a public or anonymous profile			1
is @entity18 the equivalent of a modern day " @entity45 ? " we 'll soon find out			1
@entity0 : what is @entity4 ? @entity18 : @entity4 is a digital safe space for women to have intimate conversations with each other , without feeling like the whole world is going to see what they are saying , and without trolls making hateful and unproductive comments			1
it 's an open platform where women can participate in discussions started by someone else , or start their own conversation and invite other people to join in			2
@entity0 : how does it keep out trolls ? @entity64 : we have 4 lines of defense against trollish comments : 1			2
a database that understands context , and over time can determine whether a comment is intended to be disruptive			2
filters that catch words and phrases that are against our community guidelines			2
editors who live and breathe @entity4 conversations , making sure the dialogue is one that is productive			2
on every piece of content and comment on the site , there is a troll icon			2
if someone is being hateful or disrespectful , users can report the troll and our community managers will review it			1
@entity0 : can you still post content anonymously ? @entity64 : yes			2
women can choose to participate in discussions using one of two identities : @entity99 , which is their social username , and @entity101 which is a custom username			1
she can toggle back and forth between the two identities based on the conversation she 's involved in			0
for example , i may be perfectly comfortable talking about yoga or girls education with my real name , @entity18 , but i 'm certainly not going to comment about my sex life or intimate issues using my real name			1
instead , i will use my @entity116 name			0
you know , so my @entity118 does n't see what i 'm saying			0
@entity0 : are you concerned about limiting free speech ? @entity64 : @entity4 is about the democratization of conversation			0
we are not the arbiters of opinions			0
we are not @entity127 or @entity128 , we are not pro-choice or pro-life			0
what we do n't approve of is " @entity28 " behavior -- name calling and putting people down			0
but we are not about censorship -- we just think you can have productive conversations without engaging in that type of behavior			0
@entity0 : what inspired you to set up the site ? @entity64 : i went through a divorce and the experience was the most isolating and lonely time in my life			0
i had lots of friends and @entity40 friends but i still felt alone			0
i would sit up in bed at night and cry and put these ridiculous 20 word search phrases into @entity19 and hope that a @entity152 group or something helpful would come up where i could find women like me to relate to -- but i never found anything			1
i figured i was n't alone , so i decided to create a space for those types of conversations			0
@entity0 : why did you make it women - centric ? @entity64 : based on my personal experience , i wanted to create a space where women would have the freedom to discuss whatever is on their minds and , equally important , find a community around the issues they most want and need to discuss			1
i partnered with a group of women who all had different experiences with cyberbullying and comment trolling , and we all collectively built the site we now have			2
@entity0 : what has been your most popular topic of discussion ? @entity64 : some of the topics people have become most engaged with are about mental health issues			1
we 've also seen a lot of participation in our parenting conversations -- it appears to us that people are really looking for a community around these topics that can be hard to discuss with neighbors or friends who are not in similar circumstances			1
topics around parenting a child with special needs is an area where people feel such a wide array of emotions -- confusion , guilt , fear , hope , shame			1
so it feels incredibly rewarding to see that we are providing a space where people feel comfortable asking questions and discussing things			0
@entity0 : you worked as an executive at @entity19 , @entity20 , and @entity21 -- how come none of these companies have set up something like this before ? @entity64 : i think it 's easier to innovate when you 're on your own or in a small group			1
i do my best thinking when i 'm in the shower or curling my hair			0
and you ca n't exactly come into a huge organization like @entity19 or @entity21 and say : " hey , so i was curling my hair and i had this really good idea , so i 'm going off to build it now			1
" @entity0 : what is your advice for women harassed by trolls -- engage or ignore ? @entity64 : dealing with trollish behavior online is no different than dealing with it in real life			2
the difference is that it happens more often in our online lives because our screens allow us to hide , and give us courage to say things that we would never say in our " real lives			0
" but the truth is that the line between your online life and your regular life is pretty much gone -- more and more it 's all the same			0
so take a deep breath and walk away because everything looks different after you pause for a break			0
@entity0 : where do you see the world of trolling headed -- will there come a breaking point ? trollish behavior comes from real people and typically it 's the people who were bullied , who feel hurt by someone else , who have gone through a traumatic event			0
they are taking their feelings out on someone online and whether you call it cyberbullying or trolling , until people face the inner demons and get mental health support , we 're going to see this continue			1
i think that 's where we each have a role to play -- to not stand for the behavior , and to demand that there be better protections			0
@entity0 : almost all of the videos featured on @entity4 are pulled from other websites -- are you concerned about " piggy - backing " on someone else 's work ? @entity64 : @entity4 produces our own original video conversation starters every day in our studios in @entity282			2
a huge part of @entity4 's mission is supporting the female creative economy in video , so it 's our job to highlight and support the work of female content creators online			0
