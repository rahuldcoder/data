-- does @entity1 deserve to go to prison ? the jury has decided , and he 's walking			1
whatever we may think of the @entity1 trial , one thing is certain : the prosecution was a ridiculous waste of taxpayer money on a non-crime			1
who cares if a billionaire wants to give a multimillionaire some money to hide his mistress ( who pays taxes on the gift ) ? the prosecution of @entity1 was never so much about @entity1 as it was about @entity19			1
wait -- who is @entity19 ? and why should we care ? after winning a recent primary , @entity19 is likely the next congressman in the 13th district of @entity23			1
he initiated the prosecution against @entity1 while he was a @entity25 attorney			1
but he did n't argue the case in court			0
instead , after receiving a year 's worth of headlines ( and @entity31 praise ) for charging @entity1 , @entity19 resigned from the case to run for @entity33			1
maybe @entity19 understood the weakness of the case , which rested upon @entity1 ' failure to report the money billionaire heiress @entity38 and another wealthy donor gave to him to help hide his mistress			1
the problem is that if @entity1 had reported contributions and then used them for personal expenses , he would have been guilty of a crime , since the @entity45 bars spending official campaign funds on personal expenses			2
therefore , according to @entity19 , @entity1 was damned if he did , and damned if he did n't			1
to prove his case , @entity19 had to show that @entity1 knowingly broke the law			1
but if neglecting to report the gifts as campaign contributions constituted a crime , yet reporting such gifts as contributions would violate existing law ( by implying that @entity1 converted contributions to personal use ) , then it is impossible to prove @entity1 knew he was breaking the law , which would be necessary for a conviction			2
that 's not very good legal reasoning on which to rest a case -- especially a case unlike any other that had been successfully tried			0
and since @entity19 had access to all the available evidence and knew that no witness and no recordings would suggest that @entity1 knew he was breaking the law , it is difficult to see how @entity19 thought he might win , other than hoping that jurors disliked @entity1 so much they would convict him			1
or maybe @entity19 was n't all that concerned with the legal reasoning			2
perhaps he realized that , win or lose , he 'd already gotten enough mileage from the case to realize his political ambitions			2
by the time he indicted @entity1 , the well - connected @entity19 knew that the newly @entity31 state legislature had drawn a safe district he could win , if only he could get out of the primary			1
and what better way to appeal to @entity31 diehards than prosecuting the smarmy , liberal trial lawyer @entity1 ? holding certainly received his reward last month when he won his congressional primary			1
the public generally associates politicians with the pursuit of ambition and power			0
too often , investigators act from similar motives			0
law enforcement officials seek to justify long , expensive investigations into high - profile targets by stretching the law to win convictions and mount the biggest scalps on their walls			0
the former head of the @entity99 @entity98 who investigated me for a campaign finance violation years ago said of his job : " i love the chase			0
[ it ] was fantastic			0
it was me against them			0
and the smarter they were , the richer they were , the more i enjoyed catching them			0
" but justice is n't about investigators ' adrenaline rushes or personal advancement			0
it 's about the common good			0
if the central goal of prosecuting " corrupt " public figures is to remove them from public life , then the @entity1 prosecution is a clear case of overkill			1
he is a walking punch line , unfit to run for dog catcher			0
why should prosecutors spend millions of dollars and years of time targeting him with novel legal theories ? i am familiar with @entity1 ' predicament			2
during my 2004 congressional campaign in @entity132 , i approved a meeting between two aides and a man who wanted to send out a postcard highlighting my opponent 's dismal attendance record in the state house			0
in the immediate aftermath , our campaign denied any involvement in the mailing , and then when faced with a @entity45 complaint which gave us a chance to come clean , we maintained our denial			0
five years later , through an unlikely set of circumstances culminating in my best friend 's wiretap , i ended up in prison for a year			0
as a current taxpayer who spent a year loading trucks at a prison warehouse , eating food for which you , dear reader , paid , i can tell you two things			0
first , i did not want to pay to house , feed and clothe multimillionaire lawyer @entity1			2
second , the only person in this sordid mess whom prosecutors should have considered indicting is someone who was already granted immunity			1
that 's right , @entity168 , who defrauded the 99 - year - old @entity38 by siphoning ( or , more precisely , stealing ) hundreds of thousands of dollars to build his dream house			2
of course , prosecuting @entity168 would n't have gotten @entity19 all the publicity that prosecuting @entity1 did , and it definitely would n't have gotten him to @entity33			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity174 .			2

@entity174 : @entity1 trial was a ridiculous waste of taxpayer money on a non-crime
@entity174 : prosecution of @entity1 was really about @entity19 , who will be in @entity33
he says @entity19 indicted @entity1 for political gains and attention
@entity174 : the person in this sordid mess who ought to be prosecuted is @entity168
