-- @entity2 's story has everything			1
a triumph of the human spirit			0
all - american ambition shading into moral decay			0
the enticing possibility that @entity11 could play himself			0
so we should n't be surprised that two different studios are trying to translate @entity2 's story to the big screen			1
in january , reports indicated that @entity18 's @entity17 was producing an @entity2 movie for @entity20			1
( rumors abounded that @entity22 was in the running for the lead role â € ” rumors which @entity22 denied			0
) now , @entity26 reports that @entity27 has acquired an untitled @entity2 project with a script by @entity30 , who seems well - suited to the material : he wrote the @entity33 ! , a movie about a delusional man fooling investigators , and @entity37 , a movie about how drug use might be bad for you			1
the film would be directed by @entity42			0
( a source close to the production confirmed the @entity26 report to @entity0			2
) even though it 's tempting to paint this as a race between two competing projects , there 's plenty of material in the @entity2 story			2
the @entity27 film would apparently focus partially on @entity55 , @entity2 's former teammate whose damning confession to " @entity57 " initiated the endgame of the @entity2 long con ; perhaps that film would focus more on the interaction of the @entity63 cycling teammates			1
( the @entity20 film is based on @entity66 's upcoming book cycle of lies : the fall of @entity2			1
) or maybe @entity69 will write a @entity2 movie where it turns out he was just trying to bike faster because @entity73 dumped him in college			2
@entity75 could play @entity11 ! see the original article at @entity0			0
