-- @entity4 officers knew that @entity5 had been arrested in 2004 for shooting out the tires of a car -- in a blackout fueled by anger -- and yet they admitted him into the @entity4 and granted him security clearance anyway , a senior @entity2 officer told @entity0			1
" it appears as if investigators were aware of the incident , interviewed him and were satisfied that it did not preclude granting the clearance , " the officer said			1
@entity5 , who killed 12 people monday at the @entity20 , was a military contractor who used a valid identification to gain access to the secured facility , law enforcement officials said tuesday			1
but experts , lawmakers and many in the media are now asking how @entity5 was able to obtain that clearance , given his previous run - ins with the law -- some involving guns -- as well his checkered past in the @entity4 and a history of mental illness			1
did government background investigations dig up the things about @entity5 that news agencies managed to find out within hours ? experts weigh in @entity5 " should have been screened out early on in his enlistment , " said one expert on @entity4 processes , who asked not to be identified			1
" the @entity4 and the various entities responsible for his adjudication were either unwilling or worse unable to determine he was unfit for service in the @entity4			1
" the incidents in @entity5 ' past " should have been a red flag that maybe we need to delve a little deeper into this individual , " said retired @entity53			1
2008 arrest led to @entity5 ' @entity4 discharge and private experts told @entity58 should n't have kept his clearance			1
" in all of my experience with this , he absolutely should not have gotten a clearance			2
anybody that i 've encountered with any kind -- even half of this record -- does not get a clearance , " said private attorney @entity64 , who specializes in clearance cases			2
the gun arrests alone should have disqualified him , @entity64 said			0
a checkered past the shooter at the @entity20 had a " pattern of misconduct " as a @entity4 reservist and sporadic run - ins with the law , and had contacted two @entity77 hospitals for apparent psychological issues , sources have told @entity0			1
@entity5 told police he was hearing voices at around 8 in the morning on may 6 , 2004 , @entity5 used his @entity83 to shoot out two of the tires of a 1986 @entity86 near a @entity88 , @entity89 , home where @entity5 was residing			1
he was ultimately arrested and charged with " malicious mischief			0
" @entity5 said that the owners of the car " had disrespected him " and that , he claimed , led " to what @entity5 described as a ' black - out ' fueled by anger , " according to the police report			1
@entity5 also was arrested on a gun - related offense in 2010 as well as on a disorderly charge in 2008 , but he was never prosecuted			1
also , although he was honorably discharged as a @entity4 reservist , he had at least eight instances of misconduct while on duty , according to a @entity105 defense official			1
so why was he given clearance ? " the way it happens is a poor background check , " says @entity107 , a former @entity108 counterterrorism agent			2
@entity4 officials are going back to see if his clearance should have been pulled			1
" we 're looking at his entire service record , " @entity4 spokesman rear adm. @entity114 told @entity0 's @entity115			1
" @entity118 flags , if any , were missed , and if there 's an accounting to be done			2
" how clearance works contractors can receive three levels of clearance : confidential , secret and top secret			2
@entity5 had secret clearance , the middle category			1
@entity20 shooting : what we know and do n't know a @entity131 office oversees clearance			1
applicants fill out a very long form , which asks about any contact with police , charges and convictions			0
the form also asks about mental instability			0
before obtaining clearance as a contractor , @entity5 would have theoretically been investigated by the @entity144 and ultimately granted clearance by " @entity146 " -- the @entity148 's @entity147 , in @entity149 , @entity150			1
an official at @entity146 refused to comment , referring @entity0 to the @entity131			2
@entity114 told @entity0 he could n't speak for @entity146 or its process , but @entity5 " passed a routine security clearance back in 2007 when he enlisted			1
it was good for 10 years			0
" as a reservist @entity5 was exempted from the periodic reinvestigation of clearance that active duty officers go through every 4Â½ years , or the polygraphs they go through every 2Â½ years			1
" we 're doing the forensics now to better understand if and how that clearance was reviewed , " @entity114 said			2
" if we need to account for missed flags , we will			0
while not a stellar sailor , nothing @entity5 did gave us an indication that he was capable of this brutal level of violence against people			2
" ' @entity172 ' clearance granted in march 2008 @entity5 was given a " secret " security clearance in march 2008 , shortly after he joined the @entity4 in 2007			1
he carried that clearance with him when he was honorably discharged in 2011 , @entity114 said , and could use it in another position so long as he is hired within two years			2
@entity5 was hired by a company called the experts in september 2012 to work on a @entity179 contract in @entity180 refreshing computer systems			2
" because he was n't out of work very long before this next job the security clearance went with him , " @entity114 said			1
" we 're taking a look at all the run - ins with the law if anything should have been done differently			0
" the initial background investigation on @entity5 was done by the @entity191 , @entity114 said			2
a @entity131 statement issued tuesday night said " according to applicable federal investigative standards , an individual with mr. @entity5 ' non-critical level of eligibility would only need to be reinvestigated once every 10 years			2
" the experts issued a statement saying @entity5 was properly screened			1
" we enlisted a service to perform two background checks , and we confirmed twice through the @entity131 his secret government clearance , " the statement said			0
" the latest background check and security clearance confirmation were in late june of 2013 and revealed no issues other than one minor traffic violation			1
" with security clearance , @entity5 worked from september 2012 through january in @entity180			1
his clearance was renewed in july , and he worked at facilities in @entity209 , @entity210 and @entity211 for weeks at a time upgrading computer systems , according to @entity213 , ceo of the experts			0
no one reported having any problems with him , @entity213 said			0
@entity5 began working at the @entity20 last week , though it was unclear whether he had actually begun doing work or was still securing his base clearance , @entity213 said			1
lawmakers react the possible red flags that went unnoticed have members of @entity223 outraged -- with promises to fix what they say could be gaping holes in the system			0
" we are so reliant on military contractors " that the vetting is key to our national security , sen. @entity228 told @entity0			0
@entity233 , a @entity234 who serves on the @entity235 , said she now questions " the kind of vetting contractors do			0
" @entity89 needs a lot more answers , " rep. @entity238 , @entity239 of @entity240 , told @entity0 tuesday			0
sen. @entity243 , @entity244 , is asking for a hearing to examine problems the shooting at the @entity20 highlighted			0
" in the wake of this tragedy , we must thoroughly review and fix deficiencies within existing federal contracting hiring practices that the alleged @entity20 gunman exposed and exploited to ensure the safety of the rest of our service familyâ € ” servicemembers , civilian workers , and contractors , alike , " @entity243 said			2
government relies on contractors in the 12 years since the september 11 attacks , the @entity105 has ramped up contracting to support new defense and intelligence efforts			0
and contractors are a major reason the federal government can operate today as its workforce shrinks			0
according to statistics , last year it spent more than $ 500 billion -- or roughly 14 % of the federal budget -- on private - sector contracts			0
that does n't include many contracts awarded by the @entity273 and other intelligence agencies , which keep their spending classified			0
there are already moves in @entity223 to tighten the security clearance system			1
sen. @entity279 , d - @entity280 is a co-sponsor of a bill to force government agencies asking for the background checks of potential clearance holders to increase oversight and to fire investigators who falsify those investigations			0
because of the rise in number of contractors , federal agencies often farm out background check investigations before deciding whether to grant security clearance			1
while the process is supposed to be the same whether it is done by a government or private sector employee , some experts question whether that is the case			0
one of the largest private firms that specializes in these investigations , @entity301 , which did former @entity273 contractor @entity303 's background check , is under investigation , according to an official from the @entity144 who testified before @entity223 in june			2
sen. @entity309 , @entity310 , said at the hearing her staff had been informed of the company 's " systemic failure to adequately conduct investments under its contract " with @entity144			0
@entity301 has not commented on the investigation			0
broader review planned the issue of contractors also has the attention of the @entity323 administration			0
because of the leaks from @entity303 , the director of national intelligence was already examining who should have access to classified materials			0
now officials say there will be a broader review of contractors and employees across all federal agencies			0
this review will look at the oversight , nature and implementation of security protections as well as looking at whether these employees and contractors are suited to work for the federal government , an administration official told @entity0			2
" i can tell you at the president 's direction ( the @entity346 ) is examining standards for contractors and employees across federal agencies			0
so this is obviously a matter the president believes and has believed merits review , " @entity350 press secretary @entity349 told reporters tuesday			0
@entity355 , president and ceo of the @entity357 -- the trade association for contractors -- told @entity0 that " contract employees and government employees go through the same process			0
" he argues that the focus now should not be on how @entity5 got his security clearance , but " what are the procedures for access to facilities			1
... how do you get into the building with a gun ? " @entity0 's @entity370 , @entity371 , @entity372 and @entity373 contributed to this report .			0
