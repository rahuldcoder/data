-- she 's got some of the softest hands in the business			1
but just because jockey @entity5 has a gentle touch , does n't mean she 's a push over			1
the 25 - year - old is a lean , mean , riding machine			0
and this saturday she plans on wrapping those tender palms around the most coveted trophy in @entity15 horse racing			1
could this be the first female to win the @entity17 in the 139 - year history of the race ? ahead of the " @entity17 " -- the first race in the @entity15 @entity21 -- @entity5 remains cautiously optimistic			1
" i 'm very physically fit			0
i 'm not just a little string bean female that weighs 100 pounds -- and that 's why i ride horses , " she told @entity0			1
" i think my horse @entity26 is going to be a live longshot			0
he 's very laid back , he 's not bothered by much , so the crowds should n't get to him -- he 's definitely the type of horse that you want to have in a race like this			1
" gender game the young woman from @entity37 is n't just the most successful female jockey in the country -- she 's one of the best jockeys full stop			1
@entity5 is the fifth - highest earning jockey on the circuit today , last year amassing a fortune of more than $ 12.4 million in prize money			1
in 2012 , her horses finished in the top three in nearly half the races she entered			0
not that @entity5 is immune to playing on her gender to help raise her profile in this male - dominated sport			1
" for a female jockey it 's a little bit harder to get yourself established			1
but once you can get over that hump and prove that you 're a competitive rider , and win races , it 's irrelevant what gender you are , " she said			1
" to be honest , the female aspect has worked to my advantage in a lot of respects -- just with publicity and being recognized for things that i 've accomplished which may not have been such a big deal if it was just another male jockey			2
" childhood dreams @entity5 was exposed to horses from a young age -- her father worked as a farrier , while her mother trained event ponies			2
but it was n't until she stumbled across an old video of the @entity21 as a youngster , that she discovered racing			0
" i saw this video called the " jewels of the @entity21 " on @entity82 -- i did n't have television so i would just watch this video over and over again , " said @entity5			1
" i was just inspired by it and that 's when i decided i wanted to win the @entity21			2
" at seven - years - old , @entity5 followed her older sister into pony racing -- seen as a training ground for wannabe jockeys			2
her sister eventually left the track , but @entity5 pursued her @entity21 dream and by the time she was 16 - years - old was working as an apprentice jockey			2
" learning how to ride when i was so young , learning how to communicate with horses , has given me a great foundation in horsemanship , " she said			0
" it 's a stereotype to say that all female riders are finesse riders			2
but there are also men that have that finesse factor as well			0
" dedication like many jockeys , @entity5 's rise to the top has gone hand - in - hand with a punishing routine			1
she 's suffered five major accidents and taken a total 15 months off work due to injuries			2
but the talented young rider shrugs off the risks as just a part of the job			0
" i do n't think about the danger factor , " she said			0
" it 's something i 've had a lot of experience in and i try to avoid it as much as i can			0
a typical day involves waking up at 5am and competing in up to 12 races late into the evening			0
it 's only after her day 's work is done , that @entity126 will have a meal , such is the pressure on jockeys to meet strict weight restrictions			0
family ties it can be difficult balancing a grueling career and social life			0
but once she finishes smashing the record books , @entity5 hopes to pursue another dream -- starting a family			2
" there 's still a lot of things that i want to accomplish in my career so i 'm going to try and get all of that out of the way first -- my husband and i are very excited about having a family			0
" but first things first			0
there 's a @entity17 to be won -- and @entity5 might just be the woman to do it .			1

@entity15 's most *prestigious* horse race , @entity17 , kicks off this saturday
@entity5 hoping to be first female jockey to win " @entity17 "
gender has n't *hampered* success -- has actually helped it
rise to the top involves grueling *regime* , rising at 5am , suffering five major injuries
