-- it 's not your imagination : our politics are more polarized than at any point in recent history			1
that 's the conclusion of a new survey from the indispensable @entity10			1
and if you needed more evidence of the passionate and sometimes poisonous polarization afflicting our nation , you did n't have to look further than the crowds in @entity16 on tuesday night after the recall attempt			0
here 's the real wake - up call : @entity19 are more divided about partisan politics right now than they are about race , class , gender and age			1
that 's right : forget the original sin of slavery and the longstanding fights over civil rights -- those old divisions now seem small compared with perceptions of whether a person is a @entity33 or @entity34			1
welcome to the new bigotry , where a person 's partisan identification is a source of prejudice , seen as a reflection of fundamentally different values , representative of an alien @entity19			1
like any form of prejudice , this is learned behavior , exacerbated by the daily drumbeat of partisan media			1
conservatives are led to believe that liberals are essentially less patriotic and secretly socialist , while some liberals believe that conservatives are bigoted @entity54 thumpers			0
the mutual distrust leads members of different parties to feel unfairly judged by the other side , further fueling polarization -- and so fellow @entity19 divide into warring camps , us against them			2
partisan difference did n't always seem like an unbridgeable divide			0
but over the past 25 years , the split on basic values between @entity33 and @entity66 has skyrocketed			1
for example , on the issue of the environment , at the end of the @entity71 era , 86 % of @entity33 and 93 % of @entity66 believed that " there needs to be stricter laws and regulations to protect the environment			1
" that broad consensus has fallen apart -- now , 47 % of @entity33 support that statement , while @entity66 ' sentiment remains the same			1
likewise , take a look at attitudes regarding the social safety net -- a quarter century ago 62 % of @entity33 and 79 % of @entity66 believed that government should " take care of people that could not take care of themselves			1
" today , 40 % of @entity33 believe in that aspect of the social contract , while 75 % of @entity66 still do			1
what happened to compassionate conservatism ? these policy divides reflect increased ideological and demographic differences between the two parties			2
over two - thirds of @entity33 self - identify as conservative and 87 % are @entity96 white , with an average age of 50			2
democrats are evenly split between liberals and centrists , more racially diverse than ever before and less likely to be religious or have " old - fashioned values about family and marriage			2
" there is however a hopeful sign beneath the hyper - partisanship -- a healthy rebellion against this division and consequent dysfunction in @entity110			0
according to the @entity10 survey , a record number of @entity19 are declaring their independence and proactively rejecting both the @entity33 and @entity66 parties			1
in fact , there are more independents than @entity66 or @entity33			1
it is a direct reaction against the unprecedented polarization of the two parties			0
and this ai n't no mushy middle			0
as in surveys past , we can see that independent voters tend to be closer on economic issues to @entity33 and closer to @entity66 on social issues			1
most importantly , while the two parties are deeply polarized , independent voters ' attitudes on issues most closely parallel the @entity19 people as a whole			2
at heart , most @entity19 are nonideological problem - solvers , and that 's a quality we see less and less of in our politicians			2
why does this growing polarization matter ? first , because it is resulting in an inability of the two parties to reason together on pressing issues such as improving the economy or dealing with the deficit and the debt			0
but more broadly , it risks undermining a core bit of @entity19 wisdom expressed in our national motto -- e pluribus unum : out of many , one			1
democracy requires competing political parties , but they are not supposed to take the place of tribal affiliations			0
that they are is evidence of group - think that pushes the idea that people who think differently about politics or policy are not merely mistaken but a clear and present danger to the @entity162			0
that 's the way political opponents become enemies -- even ( and especially ) if we do n't know them personally			0
changing the culture of hyper - partisanship will take time			0
it requires pushing back at the constant drumbeat of partisan media that polarizes in the pursuit of profit			0
it requires showing that there is a strong alternative , a better way to conduct civic debates			0
but this effort is essential to restoring common sense and collegiality to our politics			0
we can take comfort from the wise words of the original founding father , @entity190 , who devoted a considerable portion of his farewell address to warning against the dangers and distortions of hyper - partisanship : " one of the expedients of party to acquire influence within particular districts is to misrepresent the opinions and aims of other districts , " he wrote			0
" you can not shield yourselves too much against the jealousies and heartburnings which spring from these misrepresentations ; they tend to render alien to each other those who ought to be bound together by fraternal affection			0
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity210 .			2

@entity210 : @entity10 study confirms politics divides @entity19 more than race , class , age , gender
he says it 's bigotry , a learned behavior profoundly alienating @entity19 from each other
he says @entity33 support of social safety net , environment way down , @entity66 about same
@entity210 : split undermines core belief of e pluribus unum
