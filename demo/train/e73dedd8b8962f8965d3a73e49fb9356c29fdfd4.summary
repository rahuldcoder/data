-- smartphone competition is n't just about choosing the biggest screen , fastest processor or sleekest operating system			0
as phones continue to replace point - and - shoot cameras , a new battleground for smartphone manufacturers is camera quality			1
and the bar keeps getting raised			0
@entity13 's new @entity12 smartphone , which goes on sale july 26 through @entity15 , features a whopping 41 - megapixel camera			1
the @entity18 company is fighting to stay competitive in the phone market , where it has been overtaken by @entity21 as a top mobile phone vendor , and where @entity23 8 , its smartphone operating system of choice , is a distant third behind @entity27 and @entity28			1
@entity13 has decided to focus on adding the best possible camera technology into its phones , a mission that started with its @entity33 camera			1
unveiled in early 2012 , the 808 also featured a 41 megapixel camera but was bulkier and ran the now obsolete @entity36 operating system			1
if 41 megapixels in a smartphone sounds too good to be true it 's because in some ways it is			1
the beefed - up pixel count makes for an excellent marketing soundbite when you compare it to the competition			0
the @entity48 5 's back - facing camera is just 8 megapixels , the @entity46 4 's is 13 megapixels and the @entity51 dslr camera , favored by many professional photographers , is 22.3 megapixels			1
a megapixel -- that 's one million pixels , if you 're counting -- is a broad measurement of image quality : the more megapixels , the sharper the image and the more you can enlarge a photo without it looking blurred or grainy			1
but there is more to a good image than megapixel count			0
most amateur photographers do n't need more than 8 or 10 megapixels			0
some experts believe a better measure of a camera 's quality is the size of its light sensor : the larger a sensor , the more light it lets in and can use to create an image			2
large sensors can capture crisper photos in low - light settings			2
the sensor on the @entity12 is larger than what 's found in other smartphones , but smaller than compact cameras			1
beneath the 41 - megapixel number is some impressive proprietary technology , called oversampling , that combines data from a cluster of pixels for a single , more accurate final picture			1
the end result , typically a 5 - megapixel image , benefits from improved zooming capabilities and better low - light performance , but the images are far from dslr - quality			1
so is all this technology the start of a new battle over megapixels , this time between smartphone companies ? maybe not , says @entity102 photographer and camera - phone evangelist @entity101			1
" the idea of continuing to pack more and more megapixels into ( phone cameras ) will have diminishing returns , " said @entity101 , who recognized the potential of smartphone photgraphy early on , writing a book and app around the idea that the best camera is the one that 's with you			1
" the megapixel wars are by and large moot			0
" the benefit of high - resolution photos from phones is limited			0
people who primarily upload their images to social media sites are already compressing their images , and their friends and family are increasingly viewing them on small smartphone screens			0
it 's even possible make a decent 8 - by - 10 inch print from an @entity48 photo			2
to upload pictures over @entity132 and cellular networks , the image file needs to be a workable size			0
there are also memory limitations on smartphones , where apps , songs and videos are already competing for limited space			0
@entity101 believes there are still plenty of other areas where smartphone cameras can improve			2
he cites better low - light performance , increased dynamic range ( producing sharper contrast between an image 's shades and colors ) , and external features like better flashes and lenses			2
phone makers are moving fast to put the best features of compact cameras into smartphones			1
but the same is not yet true for camera companies			0
traditional camera manufacturers have been slow to integrate connectivity features and app ecosystems into their devices , which would require entering a strange new world of relationships with wireless carriers			0
@entity21 has started releasing cameras that run @entity169 's @entity27 operating system , but for most manufacturers , true integration is still a long ways off			2
smartphones have another advantage in the battle to be your primary camera : a surplus of sensors tracking things like location and movement			1
" what we 're going to see accelerating dramatically is the contextualization of photography , " said @entity101			0
the additional metadata collected by the various sensors inside smartphones -- not just size and sharpness -- are what will add value to photos in the future , he said			1
@entity101 predicts being able to sort your past images based on such factors as your heart rate or how fast you were moving when they were taken			0
with big data , people will be able to make more sense and add context to all photos uploaded publicly			0
imagine seeing what colors are trending in photos around the world in real time			0
if this is the future of amateur photography , smartphones already have the platform , the connections and the sensors in place			2
" images are not about dynamic range and megapixels , they 're about stories and about moments , " said @entity101			0
sensors , not megapixels , will help tell those stories .			2

@entity13 's new @entity12 smartphone will feature a 41 - megapixel camera
smartphones have advantage over cameras because they allow instant sharing
the next wave of phone cameras may *display* information collected by sensors
41 megapixels is more than some professional cameras
