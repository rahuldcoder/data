@entity0 -- at sunset , the smell of food simmering in dozens of pots starts to fill the air on @entity7			2
soon after , as if summoned by the aroma of meat and spices , a steady stream of cars starts rolling in , pulling up to the food stalls and carts where local women armed with serving spoons prepare to ladle out portions of @entity12 comfort food -- ox tripe known as mogodu , chicken feet , beans and maize dusted with spicy pepper			1
a woman in a red dress loudly licked her lips as she waited to collect several containers full of food			2
" its food from the homeland , " she said as she then hurried away to her waiting car			2
" my husband 's going to be very happy			0
" the neighbourhood that hungry @entity12 flock to on monday nights is a township called @entity39 , or @entity40			1
this densely - populated district is often associated with poverty and crime			0
squatters , many of them immigrants from other @entity47 countries in @entity12 , live in wretched conditions in shacks and derelict industrial buildings on the edges of the township , and within view of @entity54 , one of the city 's wealthiest , leafy enclaves			1
twenty - five - year - old @entity58 wants to change the township 's negative image			2
" more than anything , i want to put @entity40 on the map , " he said			0
" in terms of getting people into @entity40 and change the stigma that we have , i just want people to see it from my point of view			0
" @entity58 and his brothers are transforming their father 's small liquor store into a nightclub that they hope will one day offer panoramic views of @entity39			0
their bar -- called " @entity78 , " which is a @entity12 term for the veranda where locals gather next to the house -- is part of a larger attempt to attract members of the country 's rising black middle class back to the townships			1
workers at @entity90 set up amplifiers and haul in cases of beer under the watchful eye of 66 - year - old @entity96 , who first started selling beer to his friends at this property decades ago , when it was little more than a collection of shacks on @entity7			2
" i used to call it ' @entity104 , ' because it 's where we used to entertain myself , my friends and visitors , " the elder @entity58 said			0
deep inequalities in the days of apartheid , @entity58 said the white minority - ruled government confined black @entity12 to the township after dark			1
he also said it was difficult to start a business , since white - owned banks refused to issue loans to blacks			0
and though the poverty that is visible today in @entity39 reflects the deep income inequalities and high unemployment that continue to plague @entity12 , @entity58 said this working class neighborhood has come a long way in the last 20 years			1
" there were no tar roads , there were just gravel @entity129 were no sewage systems ... in the olden days [ we had ] bucket systems , " @entity96 said			1
pointing to the paved road outside his family 's bar , @entity58 said , " we are still saying thanks , thanks , thanks			0
my thanks to our @entity138 , " referring to @entity139 , the first democratically - elected black president of @entity12 , who has been lying in critical condition for weeks in a hospital in @entity142			1
" @entity139 made this possible			1
" by 9pm , loud dance music was blaring from amplifiers in the @entity147 bar			0
patrons arrived on roaring motorcycles , in @entity151 sedans and expensive sport utility vehicles they swayed to the music in the bar 's unfinished open structure , sipping beer and whiskey and munching on chicken feet , apparently oblivious to the winter chill			0
@entity58 danced and played @entity160 behind a laptop with big headphones on his ears			0
the customers who used to drink beer at @entity90 have changed dramatically in the last decade			0
" we know quite a few people who have made something of themselves ... economically , " @entity58 said later			2
the scene of affluent @entity12 returning from wealthy suburbs to the poor township for a taste of their roots was a homecoming of sorts			1
this uniquely @entity12 night out showed much progress has been made since the end of apartheid , and highlighted how far the country still has to go to overcome its deep social and economic challenges .			1

in the days of apartheid , black @entity12 were confined to the township after dark
@entity96 said his working class neighborhood has come a long way in the last 20 years
" @entity139 made this possible , " he says
