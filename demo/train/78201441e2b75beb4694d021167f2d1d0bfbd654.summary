-- the @entity1 on thursday breached the third and final portion of a levee on the @entity4 to help offset catastrophic floods in communities across several states			1
the @entity1 opened the final crevasse in the @entity10 levee , under a plan that blasted holes in the structure with hopes of easing unprecedented flood pressure , said col. @entity16 , commander of the @entity18 district			1
" it acted as designed , " maj. gen. @entity19 , president of the @entity20 , told reporters about the breaching			2
" we reduced the gauges at @entity25 ( @entity26 ) 3.1 feet			2
at @entity28 ( @entity29 ) , it 's 3.3 feet			2
" the @entity1 started the plan on monday			2
some who live where the @entity33 and @entity34 meet said it has helped			2
the @entity37 level at @entity28 , @entity29 , has dropped nearly 2 feet since monday afternoon			2
officials said they believe the levels would be up to 3 feet higher now if the levee had not been detonated			2
still , the town of @entity28 was under a mandatory evacuation order and six other communities were under voluntary evacuation notices , said @entity45 , spokeswoman for the @entity46			2
the decision to breach the @entity10 levee was controversial			0
@entity50 officials took the corps to court over the plan , questioning the agency 's authority to intentionally breach the levee			0
the state argued the floodwater would deposit silt on about 130,000 acres , and it would take years , along with millions of dollars , to fix the damage			0
maj. gen. @entity59 , commander of the @entity60 , made the decision to order the breach			0
he warned that without punching a hole in the levee , massive flooding would threaten to inundate communities throughout the @entity4 and @entity33 river valleys			1
the @entity69 @entity68 declined to intervene in the case on sunday , clearing the way for @entity72 to blow up part of the levee			0
despite the plan , many areas were inundated as the @entity4 spilled out across huge swaths of farmland , creating massive flooding from @entity78 to @entity79			1
the water was coursing across an area of farmland that @entity50 gov. @entity83 described as " literally the most productive part of our continent			1
" @entity50 sen. @entity87 said the @entity1 ' decision was a tough one for them to make			1
" clearly , this is an epic flood , " she told @entity0 , adding that the flooding of the farmland is " an economic devastation to that part of my state			1
" the sight makes you " sick to your stomach , " said farmer @entity98 as he surveyed his submerged fields			0
" farming is all i ever have done ... and it 's under water , " he told @entity0 affiliate @entity102			1
the flooding has been triggered by heavy rains and meteorologists say it 's not expected to fully relent until early june			1
more than 20 miles of westbound @entity110 in eastern @entity111 was closed due to flooding , state police reported early thursday			1
the closure was between the towns of @entity115 and @entity116 , according to lt. @entity117 , who said he expects the eastbound lanes to close later in the day			0
on thursday , 11 @entity4 counties along the @entity4 were declared federal disaster areas in anticipation of major flooding , gov. @entity119 said			1
" this will be a monumental flood , and i ask residents to take this risk seriously and make evacuation plans , " @entity119 said			1
the state 's department of transportation prepared a list of possible road closures , but as of thursday afternoon , only one road was closed , @entity136 465 in @entity137 and @entity139 counties between @entity140 and @entity141 , the agency said			1
" there is no exact science to this , so it 's imperative that state and federal agencies work closely to lead us through this crisis , " @entity143 transportation commissioner @entity142 said in a prepared statement			1
in @entity155 , @entity4 , officials are expecting the the river to crest at 48 feet on tuesday -- which will be a record since the levee was built along the county 's riverbanks in the mid- 1930s , county spokesman @entity153 told @entity0			1
then the river will flow above the 40 feet mark for 40 days , @entity153 said			0
those heights are still well below the 60 feet needed to push the water over the levee , @entity153 said			1
but the heights are sufficient enough to force the temporary closure , as a precautionary measure , of the county 's nine casinos near the levee , @entity153 said			0
residential areas by the levee have been evacuated , and about 10,000 sand bags have been deployed , he said			1
about 40 people are being sheltered in a recreation center , and 34 dogs and 16 cats are now in the @entity176 , sometimes used for horse or livestock shows , he said			0
the casinos ' closure for 40 days would amount to a major economic hit to @entity155 , @entity153 said			0
the gambling centers are the closest casinos available , at 16 miles away , for gamblers from @entity18 , a state that does n't have such facilities , @entity153 said			1
" it 's not a happy mood , but we 're happy that we got the levee , " @entity153 told @entity0			0
" it 's a rural county with agriculture no. 1 and casinos no. 2 , and now we do n't have casinos			0
we do n't know how long it is going to last			0
we hope it does n't last too long			0
" before the flood , " we were actually 21 % down from last year with the casinos up and running			2
now that they 're shut down , we 're 100 % down from last year , " @entity153 said			0
" we 're just holding on			0
" @entity0 's @entity199 contributed to this report .			0
