@entity0 -- years of budget cuts have made two key @entity6 agencies ' efforts to contain the threat of @entity8 harder than it should be , rep. @entity2 told @entity1 on thursday			1
the @entity11 @entity10 pointed to spending cuts at the @entity13 and the @entity14 , which are both involved in the response to a @entity17 man who this week became the first patient diagnosed with @entity8 in the @entity6			1
" there 's no doubt that the deep health care cuts that we 've seen have made it more difficult to respond in a rapid and comprehensive way to the @entity8 outbreak , " @entity2 said			1
" they 're doing everything they can with the resources they have now , but the cuts they 've seen in past years , they were like eroding the foundation and it clearly meant that they were starting from behind , " he said			0
no ' ebola czar ' is forthcoming , @entity37 says the @entity13 saw its discretionary funding cut by $ 585 million from 2010 to 2014 , while the @entity14 's budget was slashed by $ 446 million over the last four years			2
@entity41 , director of the @entity42 , spelled out the impact of the cuts in dire terms during a recent hearing on @entity47			2
" i have to tell you honestly it 's been a significant impact on us , " @entity41 said			1
" it has both in an acute and a chronic , insidious way eroded our ability to respond in the way that i and my colleagues would like to see us be able to respond to these emerging threats			0
and in my institute particularly , that 's responsible for responding on the dime to an emerging infectious disease threat , this is particularly damaging			0
" @entity13 director : why @entity6 can stop @entity8 in its tracks the @entity13 also cited the budget cuts in a report earlier this year , saying that annual funding for its public health preparedness and response efforts were $ 1 billion lower in the 2013 fiscal year than in 2002			1
" @entity13 continues to work with reduced financial resources , which similarly affects state , local , and insular public health departments , " the report said			0
" these losses make it difficult for state and local health departments to continue to expand their preparedness capabilities , instead forcing them to focus on maintaining their current capabilities			0
