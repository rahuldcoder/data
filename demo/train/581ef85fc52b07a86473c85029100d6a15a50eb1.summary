@entity0 , @entity1 -- in remote northern @entity1 , it is now a race against time to prevent a catastrophe in the world 's worst - ever recorded outbreak of lead poisoning			1
officially 163 people have already died in @entity11 -- 111 of them children			1
but no one knows the true figures			0
" you read about it in the literature but several hundred children have died here as a result of what happened here , " says @entity15 from the environmental engineering organization the @entity16 , which is heading the clean - up operation in the region			1
children began to die in january , but only now in june has the clean - up operation begun in the mud - hut village of @entity0			1
using the only tools available -- crude metal hoes normally used for farming -- local villagers are trying to clear the contaminated topsoil from the worst - affected housing compounds			1
dug up , the soil is put into plastic bags and buried far from the village			0
young children look on as their friends and family wear unfamiliar white protective suits and face masks			2
and they inhale more of the stirred - up dust			2
the @entity42 - based @entity16 -- a global leader in pollution clean - up operations -- has found disturbingly high levels of lead across the village			1
" the fact that this is 10,000 parts per million -- which is 1 percent lead -- that 's very high , " explains @entity48 of the @entity16			1
in the @entity42 , the standard for residential - area soils is normally 400 parts per million			2
" because lead particles are so small , the levels so high , and because in this environment the kids are always in contact with the soil -- it 's extremely dangerous for them to be exposed to levels like these , " says @entity48			1
the @entity16 currently is trying to help clean up a toxic lead site in @entity67 where , in the last few years , 18 people died			2
until now , it was the worst case of lead poisoning anyone had seen			1
" we were asked if we 'd come over and look at this [ site ] so we only planned on a four - day visit -- but it 's so bad we just have to stay and do what we can , " says @entity15			2
many of the men in the region are gold miners			1
they bring the metal ore mined from the local mines back to be crushed by their wives and children in their homes			1
unbeknownst to them , the gold ore contains extremely high levels of lead			1
the ore processing has since been moved out of most of the villages and , in theory , the lead could be cleared away			2
" i will instruct all the people to excavate their houses , " the local chief , @entity93 , declares			2
" but it will be difficult to enforce because of poverty			0
" there are also many other problems			0
just getting to @entity0 village takes several hours ' drive -- a journey that will soon be made almost impossible with the oncoming rains			0
and with the rains coming , the young men working to clear away the contaminated earth are anxious to get to their farms			1
@entity107 of the @entity16 is helping train them in safely removing the contaminated soil			0
" this is a local problem , this is not an international problem , " he says			0
" so if they can own it , it 'll be very good because long , long after we 're gone they will be here			0
" it is hoped that @entity119 village will be cleared in 26 days , but manpower is still lacking			0
the local government , apart from handing out red election hats for an upcoming vote , is almost nowhere to be seen			0
" i tell you that the problem has now been contained and we are now on remediation , " explains @entity124 , the local environmental commissioner			0
" i 'm sure these measures are good enough			0
" the government claims there have been no more fatalities since it first identified the problem as lead poisoning			1
however , @entity0 is only one of seven villages identified with extremely toxic levels of lead -- and the only village in the region receiving an on - going clean - up operation			1
from reports , some of the other villages are not being monitored properly			0
and there has been no thorough report on whether there are more villages suffering from the same toxic levels of lead			2
" we hope to do just this village before the rainy season , but by mid-july there 'll be so much rain we wo n't be able to , and we 'll have to wait until october , " says @entity15			0
" the kids will still be exposed			0
" on sunday , the village cleared its first compound			0
for now , villagers are just taking it one home at a time .			1
