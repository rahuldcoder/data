-- @entity1 , @entity2 , and a hidden map with a secret escape route ? for @entity6 during @entity7 , monopoly Â® games came equipped with real - life " get out of jail free " cards			1
during @entity7 , the @entity12 secret service hatched a master plan to smuggle escape gear to captured @entity16 soldiers inside @entity17			1
their secret weapon ? monopoly boxes			0
the original notion was simple enough : find a way to sneak useful items into prison camps in an unassuming form			1
but the idea to use @entity2 came from a series of happy coincidences , all of which started with maps			1
smooth as silk maps are harder to smuggle than you might think			0
they fall apart when wet , and they make a lot of noise when unfolded			0
@entity16 officials feared paper maps might draw the attention of @entity17 troops , so they turned to an unlikely source for help -- silk			1
not only would silk maps hold up in all kinds of weather , but they 'd also come with the life - saving benefit of being whisper quiet			0
to produce these silent maps , the @entity52 turned to @entity54 , a company that had recently perfected the process of printing on silk and was already manufacturing silk escape maps for @entity12 airmen to carry			1
what else was @entity54 known for ? you guessed it -- being the licensed manufacturer of @entity2 outside the @entity64			1
suddenly , the popular board game seemed like the perfect way to get supplies inside @entity17 - run pow camps			1
at the time , the @entity69 were hard - pressed to get provisions to their own troops , much less to the @entity16 soldiers they 'd captured			1
wishing to hide this less - than - stellar upholding of the @entity74 , they happily welcomed @entity76 aid packages for pows			2
so throwing @entity2 games into the care kits along with food and clothing was met with little scrutiny			1
@entity2 was already a well - known game throughout @entity84 , and the @entity17 guards saw it as the perfect way for their detainees to remain occupied for hours			2
@entity88 in 1941 , the @entity89 approached @entity54 with its master plan , and before long , production of a " special edition " @entity2 set was underway			1
for the top - secret mission , the factory set aside a small , secure room -- unknown to the rest of its employees -- where skilled craftsmen sat and painstakingly carved small niches and openings into the games ' cardboard boxes			0
along with the standard thimble , car , and @entity108 , the pow version included additional " playing " pieces , such as a metal file , a magnetic compass , and of course , a regional silk escape map , complete with marked safe - houses along the way -- all neatly concealed in the game 's box			2
even better , some of the @entity2 money was real			1
actual @entity17 , @entity121 , and @entity122 currency was placed underneath the play money for escapees to use for bribes			0
also , because of its collaboration with the @entity128 , @entity54 could track which sets would be delivered to which camps , meaning escape maps specific to the area could be hidden in each game set			1
@entity16 soldiers and pilots headed to the front lines were told to look for the special edition game if they were captured			1
the identifying mark to check for ? a red dot in the corner of the @entity142			0
get out of jail free by the end of the war , it 's estimated that more than 35,000 @entity147 had escaped from @entity17 prison camps			0
and while there 's no way to set an exact figure on it , more than a few of those escapees certainly owe their breakout to the classic board game			0
but despite its brave and noble role in all of it , @entity2 's heroic war deeds would go unrecognized for decades			2
strict secrecy about the plan was maintained during the war , not only so that the @entity12 could continue using the game to help pows , but also because @entity54 feared a targeted reprisal by @entity17 bombers			0
after the war , all remaining sets were destroyed , and everyone involved in the plan , including the escaped prisoners , were told to keep quiet			0
in the event of another large - scale war , @entity16 officials also wanted to make sure the seemingly innocent board game could go back into action			1
@entity174 goes behind the @entity175 believe it or not , it was n't long before @entity2 found itself in the middle of yet another international conflict -- this time defending itself from @entity181 leaders in @entity182			2
being that @entity2 is essentially a game in which one player gets rich at the expense of others becoming poor , @entity184 officials had long seen the board game as an overt symbol of capitalistic frivolity and greed			1
so , as its popularity soared , @entity181 took more and more efforts to curb the enthusiasm			0
@entity196 , the @entity184 , and other @entity198 countries outlawed the game for fear it would corrupt the public with positive notions about a free - market economy			0
@entity184 leaders even tried coming up with their own @entity205 - themed spin - off games designed to highlight the virtues of frugality			0
the title of one such knockoff from communist - era @entity210 loosely translated to " @entity212 , " while another in @entity182 had a name that roughly meant " manage			0
" but bans and spin - offs could n't hold down the individualistic drive of the human spirit			0
@entity2 became an underground success , secretly coveted and played behind the @entity175 as a way of escaping the drudgery of @entity184 life			2
it was n't until 1987 , four years before the collapse of the @entity184 , that @entity2 was allowed to be legally sold there			2
today , @entity2 is licensed in more than 80 countries , and no fewer than 200 spin - off versions exist			2
of course , playing it in the cozy confines of your living room , it 's easy to take for granted that there was a time when , to many , @entity2 was a lot more than just a game			2
