@entity0 saw the sick child was distressed and felt he had to do something			1
so he picked the kid up to comfort him			1
and with that act of kindness , the 37 - year - old ambulance supervisor in @entity5 , @entity6 , contracted @entity9 himself			1
" of course , he got vomit all over him and that 's how he got @entity9 , " said photographer @entity10 , who shot @entity12 's image for @entity14 's " @entity13 " magazine cover , which honors those on the front line of the @entity9 epidemic			1
they 're " the ones who answered the call , " the magazine said on its website wednesday morning			1
@entity10 expanded on why @entity12 was chosen for one of the magazine 's five covers : " he 's the shining example of what the right thing to do is			2
he 's a shining example that we should all try to follow			2
he really did touch me with his story			2
i do n't usually like to use the word hero , but i have to use it here			2
" according to the latest @entity40 figures , about 6,300 people have died from the disease , mainly in @entity42			2
health workers are still battling more than 11,000 confirmed cases in @entity45 , @entity6 and @entity46 , and more than 6,000 suspected and probable cases loom , according to @entity40			2
though those countries mark the epicenter of the outbreak , isolated cases have spread wider , penetrating other @entity53 countries , @entity54 and even the @entity55			1
@entity14 's editors decided to honor the " unprecedented numbers " of doctors and nurses who responded when @entity9 overtook an already - weak public health infrastructure , and @entity14 editor @entity61 outlined how governments were ill - equipped to respond , who " was in denial and snarled in red tape " and first responders were accused of crying wolf as the disease spread			1
yet many doctors and nurses , especially those from @entity72 and @entity73 , responded and worked alongside local physicians , nurses , ambulance drivers and burial teams , @entity61 wrote			2
some were driven by @entity79 , while others did it for country and some simply had " the instinct to run into the fire , not away , " she wrote			0
" @entity9 is a war , and a warning			1
the global health system is nowhere close to strong enough to keep us safe from infectious disease , and ' us ' means everyone , not just those in faraway places where this is one threat among many that claim lives every day , " wrote @entity61			0
she continued , " the rest of the world can sleep at night because a group of men and women are willing to stand and fight			0
for tireless acts of courage and mercy , for buying the world time to boost its defenses , for risking , for persisting , for sacrificing and saving , the @entity9 fighters are @entity14 's 2014 @entity13			1
" in addition to @entity12 , the ambulance driver , @entity14 highlighted on its cover four other @entity9 fighters who worked on the ground in @entity42 : -- dr. @entity111 is a @entity6 surgeon who converted his hospital 's chapel into one of the country 's first treatment centers			1
the center 's reception area , where @entity111 gets dressed , is a bare room , lit by a single bulb , @entity10 , the photographer , said			0
-- @entity122 is an @entity9 survivor who lost both parents to the disease and undertook the task of counseling patients in @entity6			1
@entity10 recalled how the @entity72 caregiver appeared to be a typical young woman , dressed nicely and a little nervous about being photographed			0
" but then , she put on her scrubs			0
... she became very calm , a little bit introverted , " the photographer said			0
-- @entity131 is a @entity72 health promoter who has been in @entity42 since march			0
the @entity55 was uneasy during the 10 minutes it took to shoot her photo , @entity10 said			0
" she was distracted , she wanted to do other things			0
" -- dr. @entity138 became the first @entity55 infected while running a treatment center in @entity5			1
because he is a religious man , @entity14 shot him at his church in @entity141 , @entity142			0
" @entity144 was working in @entity42 doing a lot of hard , selfless work to help people out , " photographer @entity143 said			0
among the others considered for " @entity13 " honors were @entity151 president @entity150 , @entity153 commissioner @entity152 and the protesters in @entity155 , @entity156			1
other finalists included singer @entity158 , @entity160 internet tycoon @entity159 , @entity162 ceo @entity161 and @entity165 @entity164 leader @entity163			1
pope @entity166 received the title in 2013			0
the magazine 's readers voted for @entity171 prime minister @entity170 to receive the title , but the @entity14 editors ' decision is based on their view of " the person or persons who most affected the news and our lives , for good or ill , and embodied what was important about the year			0
