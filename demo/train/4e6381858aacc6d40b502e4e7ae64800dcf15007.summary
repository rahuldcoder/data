so why would @entity0 -- the original king of @entity3 discussion groups -- pay over $ 1 billion for a simple little blog - publishing tool like @entity5 ? does n't the giant web company have the ability to create its own application that lets people post words and pictures online ? of course it does			1
no , @entity0 is n't buying a technology company so much as the community that uses it			1
it paid a billion bucks for @entity5 for the very same reason that @entity17 paid a billion dollars last year for web - sharing app @entity18 : for the kids			1
that 's right , the net 's biggest corporations are willing to pay through the nose to acquire teenagers -- that coveted yet slippery demographic for whom the @entity27 is a tired old workplace , @entity17 is their parents ' ( or grandparents ' ) social network , and @entity0 has something to do with stock quotes and sports scores			1
a new generation of apps and networks -- from @entity5 and @entity18 to @entity39 and @entity40 -- has emerged alongside this new generation of users , and if traditional companies ca n't beat them , they may as well buy them			1
teens and young 20 - somethings have been drifting away from what over- 30s people think of as the internet for years now			1
the @entity27 is flat , static , and largely dependent on desktop and laptop computers to work right			2
younger people are much less likely to connect to the net -- or to each other -- through these cumbersome devices than they are to use smartphones			2
the mobile web , as it 's called , works differently			1
it 's navigated by thumb , through separate apps , and in shorthand			2
the big websites and search engines of yesteryear ( well , at least yesterweek ) -- like @entity0 , for example -- just were n't built for this kind of light engagement			1
they 're meant for keyboards and mice , not swiping and txt shorthand			0
meanwhile , the corporations running big websites and social networks might seem like upstarts to older users , but to young people they are pre-existing conditions of the universe			1
just as the @entity80 might as well be @entity81 , @entity17 might as well be @entity82 or @entity83			0
the big established networks just are n't cool			0
@entity85 is already almost 30			0
plus , his social network -- just like those of his peers at @entity89 -- feels unnecessarily complex and requires a big commitment			2
everything one does in the adult social media world goes down on one 's permanent record			0
the experience on a site like @entity17 is so involved -- friends lists , updates , photo streams , timelines , advertisements -- from the teen perspective , it 's a @entity104			0
compare that to something like @entity18			0
you take a picture and it goes up and out			0
or @entity39 : you take a picture and it goes to a friend , and then it disappears			0
how cool is that ? the less weighty and permanent and stickily complex a social networking experience , the less it feels like it 's the province of marketers , too			0
every keystroke , recommendation , follow , like and update is recorded and stored			0
kids are becoming aware that the more involved the data footprint they create somewhere , the more it will be used against them by big data researchers looking to predict their future activities and then market to them the things they do n't yet know they 're about to desire			0
this is why the real job of younger companies is to prove they are not your parents ' social apps			0
that 's why it becomes particularly challenging when a hip " young person 's " social app is swallowed by a big , old , uncool web company			1
after @entity5 's base of young users found out about the sale , they went into a near state of panic			1
many posted on @entity150 and elsewhere how this represents the end of an era , and how they are now destined to move on to the next frontier			2
for its part , @entity5 is working hard to prove it still has indie cool street cred			2
in his blog post responding to the angst around his " selling out , " @entity5 founder @entity157 sounded like a young @entity160 by insisting " how awesome this is			1
" then , as if to prove @entity5 is still cool enough to do naughty things even though it 's now owned by a zillion - dollar corporate conglomerate , he signed his post , " f * * * yeah			1
" maybe that 'll work , but it looks to me like @entity5 has gone from being cool to trying to sound cool			2
and we all know where that leads .			0

@entity173 : web giant @entity0 bought @entity5 for $ 1 billion to *attract* young people
he says kids use mobile web far more than desktop that requires heavier engagement
now that it 's been swallowed , @entity5 risks turning uncool , he says
@entity173 : kids ' *tweets* about end of an era show challenge of being bought by @entity0
