@entity0 -- the chairman of the @entity3 plans to unleash a withering attack wednesday on private contractors working for the company formerly known as @entity7 in @entity8 , accusing them of flouting regulations and endangering the @entity11 mission			1
key to beating the @entity14 in @entity8 will be the ability of @entity11 forces to win support from the @entity8 people , many of whom do not distinguish between @entity11 contractors and the @entity11 military , sen. @entity12 will say , according to an advance text of his remarks			1
" if we are going to win that struggle , we need to know that our contractor personnel are adequately screened , supervised and held accountable -- because in the end , the @entity8 people will hold us responsible for their actions , " the @entity26 @entity25 will say			1
" if we do n't fix the problems of oversight and make sure contractors like @entity7 play by the rules and live up to their commitments -- we 'll be doing a disservice to our troops by making their already difficult and dangerous job even more so			1
" see agenda of 9:30 a.m. wednesday hearing though more than 100,000 contractors operate for a variety of contractors in @entity8 , @entity12 singled out @entity7 , a company that had " no meaningful distinction " from the company formerly known as @entity7 , which is currently known as @entity7 , he said in the advance text			1
shooting at @entity51 @entity12 cited a december 9 , 2008 , shooting at the @entity11 military 's range at @entity51 during which a @entity7 program manager carrying an @entity54 got on the back of a moving car , then shot and wounded a @entity7 trainer on his team when the car hit a bump , @entity12 said			1
though the program manager lost his job , the others on his team who allowed his activities did not , he said			0
combined @entity67 , a multinational military formation that trains the @entity69 , did not appear to have investigated the incident , he said			0
had it done so , the @entity76 " would have seen that @entity7 personnel were using weapons improperly and unsafely , with inadequate supervision , and that they were carrying weapons that they were n't even supposed to have , " according to @entity12			1
two civilians killed he also cited a widely reported may 5 , 2009 , incident in which two @entity7 personnel fired their weapons , killing two @entity8 civilians and wounding a third			1
the two men have been charged with murder in the shootings			0
an @entity69 investigation appeared to find that the contract personnel had " violated alcohol consumption policies , were not authorized to possess weapons , violated use - of - force rules and violated movement - control policies , " said @entity12 , who cited as his source the man who then led the @entity95			1
@entity7 's contract required it to " ensure that its personnel ... behave at all times in accordance with the highest professional and ethical standards , " @entity12 said			1
records for the two men responsible for the may 5 shooting show the company failed to properly vet them , @entity12 said			2
one man 's military record " apparently included assault , insubordinate conduct , absence without leave , failure to obey order or regulation , larceny and wrongful appropriation , " he said			0
and his criminal record showed convictions for reckless driving , disturbing the peace , assault and battery , driving while intoxicated , resisting arrest and trespassing			0
the other man was cited in a news report for having been discharged from the @entity11 military after being absent without leave for 22 days and testing positive for cocaine , @entity12 said			1
other @entity7 personnel were fired for alcohol use and drug use , he said			2
company looks forward to testifying in a written statement , a spokesman for @entity7 said the company is looking forward to testifying wednesday			2
" @entity7 's new management was taking steps to address shortcomings in the @entity7 program when the tragic may 5 incident occurred , " said @entity138 of @entity139			0
" one of those shortcomings discovered was that the former management of @entity7 had provided weapons to personnel for personal protection without first obtaining the proper authorization from @entity151			2
" @entity153 , the prime contractor , and the @entity151 customer were both aware of @entity157 's decision , and were working to obtain authorization , contractors should not have been armed without the proper approvals			0
that said , the individual independent contractors ' actions the night of may 5 clearly violated clear company policies and they are being held accountable			0
" after the may 2009 shooting , @entity153 -- which had subcontracted the work to @entity7 -- accused the company of having failed to properly oversee its personnel			2
@entity7 responded that it would need more money to do that , @entity12 said , calling the company 's response " deeply troubling " since its contractual obligation already called for that			1
in addition , @entity7 called its personnel " independent contractors , " despite " compelling evidence " that they were company employees , @entity12 said			1
that meant that the company withheld no income taxes and paid no @entity182 , @entity183 or unemployment tax for them , he said			0
the @entity186 is considering @entity7 's classification			0
@entity76 also criticized @entity12 also took to task the @entity76 for " apparent lack of contractor oversight			0
" before last may 's shooting , the @entity69 said it had no contracting officer representative in the area , telling the committee that it relied on a @entity196 contractor to oversee the project			0
the @entity69 said it also monitored the contractors from an office in @entity200 by calling the chief of training and education for the @entity204 at @entity95			0
but the chief has told the committee that he did not travel to the training sites to observe @entity7 's personnel , @entity12 said			2
on december 3 , 2008 , before the first shooting incident , @entity153 told the @entity69 by e-mail that @entity7 workers had weapons without authority , @entity12 said , but the @entity69 " apparently failed to take action			1
" a separate report released earlier this month by the inspectors general of the @entity151 and the @entity217 criticizes the @entity217 for its oversight of @entity8 training contracts , specifically a $ 1 billion contract to train @entity221			2
the @entity217 failed to keep track of the money and materials , including weapons , and failed to prepare the police to fight off insurgents , the report said			0
additionally , @entity12 said a key mission of @entity11 forces in @entity8 is to train and equip @entity8 security forces to take the lead in the war , adding that they use a @entity11 - operated facility near @entity235 to store weapons for the @entity8 forces			1
though no policy exists that allows contractors or subcontractors to use weapons stored at the site , called @entity247 22 , @entity7 personnel " acquired several hundred weapons , including more than 500 @entity54 , from the facility on multiple occasions , " @entity12 said			1
though the company said last june that it had returned them all , @entity12 said that was not the case , citing one @entity54 that was not returned until late last month			0
" these are weapons that belonged to the @entity221 -- not @entity7 , " he said			2
" and it is only on the eve of this hearing that the company is giving the majority of them back to the @entity8 government			0
" @entity12 concluded the advance text by saying that the contractors need to understand that they have an impact on how the @entity11 military is perceived			1
" even one irresponsible act by contractor personnel can hurt the mission and put our troops in harm 's way , " he said			0
" if we do n't fix the problems of oversight and make sure contractors like @entity7 play by the rules and live up to their commitments -- we 'll be doing a disservice to our troops by making their already difficult and dangerous job even more so			2
