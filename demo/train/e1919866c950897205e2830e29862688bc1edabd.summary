@entity0 -- @entity3 secretary of state @entity2 is back in the @entity4 where he plans to propose a framework for a lasting peace deal between @entity8 and the @entity9 , saying the time is close for tough decision - making			1
@entity2 arrived in @entity12 on thursday and immediately headed for @entity13 , the start of his ninth trip to the region since taking over as @entity3 's top diplomat nearly a year ago			1
a senior @entity19 official said @entity2 's talks with @entity8 prime minister @entity21 and @entity9 president @entity22 would be substantive			1
" it is an effort to provide agreed guidelines for a permanent status agreement , that is to say , a full and final peace treaty between the parties , " the official said			0
@entity2 said in @entity13 " we know the parameters and the possibilities of peace " after several months of discussions			2
he met with @entity21 first , but the @entity8 leader was not optimistic in brief public remarks			2
he expressed fresh doubts the @entity9 were committed to peace			0
" i know that you are committed to peace			0
i know that i am committed to peace			0
but , unfortunately , given the actions and words of @entity9 leaders , there 's growing doubt in @entity8 that the @entity9 are committed to peace , " @entity21 said in a speech at the start of his meeting with @entity2			1
during the remarks , @entity21 accused @entity22 of glorifying a group of @entity9 prisoners recently released by @entity8			1
the release of the prisoners is part of a @entity3 - backed deal to jump - start peace talks			0
meanwhile , @entity9 have accused @entity21 of sabotaging the talks with the announcement of new settlements in the @entity56 and @entity13 -- areas that are considered key in any creation of a @entity9 state			1
with @entity4 peace in mind , @entity2 coaxes @entity8 on @entity62 @entity2 's proposal is based on five months of intensive consultations with @entity8 and @entity9 since the resumption of the peace process last summer			1
he intends to test them on some of the ideas resulting from those talks			0
the purpose of the trip is for @entity2 to " climb with the two leaders to the top of the hill and be able to share with them the view of what 's on the other side , what peace will look like in terms of all of the core issues that have to be resolved between them , " the official said			2
the hope is that it will be easier to finalize details once the shared vision is understood , the official added			0
but gaps remain , and the @entity3 acknowledges that achieving the ultimate goal will not be easy as evidenced by recent actions by both sides			0
with direct negotiations between the two sides flailing , the @entity92 administration seems to have moved into a more muscular role as mediator by presenting its own bridging proposals instead of relying on the @entity8 and @entity9 to negotiate between themselves			1
with @entity4 peace in mind , @entity2 coaxes @entity8 on @entity62 @entity1 's @entity99 contributed to this report .			2
