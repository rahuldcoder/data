why play one sport when you can play two at the same time ? that was the question a number of like - minded individuals were asking themselves , circa 2006			1
and it is thanks to the vision of these select few that the sport of @entity11 -- a game , unsurprisingly , combining elements of football and golf -- was born and has been spreading its way around the globe ever since			1
one of those men was @entity19 , who today combines the roles of president of the @entity22 ( @entity22 ) and president of @entity11			1
" i just knew @entity11 would be a bit of a no - brainer for the amount of golf courses there are , as well as the number of golfers and footballers , " @entity19 told @entity24 of a game that involves players kicking a football around a golf course , complete with bigger holes			1
" i always thought it would take off			2
so it was just a question of waiting for the right time to get involved with it all really			2
" after years in production , @entity19 would bring the sport to the @entity45 -- where there are now over 10,000 active players -- and set up @entity11 in 2012			1
yet it is a @entity49 called @entity50 who is credited with the title of founding father of the game			2
" he created what we do today , " @entity19 said			2
" he created everything , from how the game is played , down to the look of the players			1
" kicking around a new idea @entity50 , now an @entity22 ambassador , held the first @entity11 competition in the @entity49 in 2008 , after hearing of a unique idea from friend and former professional footballer @entity66			1
@entity66 had played an early interpretation of the game during his days at @entity69 , when he and his teammates would attempt to kick a football from the training pitch back to the changing rooms in as little time as possible			2
the mere invention of @entity11 seems to be a natural progression , given that football and golf have long shared a close relationship			1
footballers are well known for playing golf in their spare time , so perhaps it is no surprise that @entity11 has proved such a hit with those hailing from a footballing background -- 70 % of people who have taken up the sport have been footballers			1
while there is obviously the relaxing aspect of walking around a golf course on a sunny day , former @entity93 player @entity92 also feels that the sport represents another opportunity for footballers to flex their competitive muscles			2
" there is that challenge when playing golf			2
as sportsmen , we 've all got that in our lockers			0
we want to challenge each other , we want to challenge ourselves and obviously be the best			0
that 's why footballers turn to golf , " he told @entity24			0
" it can be a challenge if you want , but i think it 's good that you can actually have it as a casual game as well			0
some footballers play golf but do it as a hobby , to relax and wind down , and escape from the pressures of a football match on a saturday			0
" but while golf is in good health when it comes to attracting footballers , the sport has lost players in recent years -- according to a report in the @entity129 , a recent survey by the @entity132 @entity131 estimated the game has lost five million in the last decade , with 20 % of the existing 25 million golfers likely to quit in the next few years			0
many feel the game takes too long to play , is too difficult to learn and has too many complicated rules , which has led to a number of new alternatives being introduced to help boost a sport in decline			2
such concerns have led to the introduction on golf courses of 15 inch - wide holes -- about four times the width of a standard hole -- a relaxation in the game 's rules , and of course , @entity11			1
gaining a worldwide foothold since @entity50 's inaugural competition -- open to a mix of @entity49 and @entity156 professional footballers -- the sport has gone from strength to strength			0
three countries formed the @entity22 in june 2012 for the first ever @entity161 in @entity162 , @entity163 , while today the world governing body boasts 22 different member nations , ranging from @entity167 to @entity168			1
" a lot of people are getting involved and loving the sport			0
it 's definitely the fun element that attracts people to it , " @entity19 said			0
" it catches such a large demographic because it 's such a low skill level to be able to play			0
you 've just got to be able to kick a ball			0
" and it is the sport 's ability to appeal to all that means a @entity11 course somewhere has likely played host to either a family visit , a first date , a corporate business trip or even , as was the case in the @entity45 , an 81 - year - old grandmother 's day out with her grandson			1
but while there is little doubting the game 's capacity to attract members from most walks of life , @entity19 feels luring newcomers at a young age is truly pivotal to @entity11 's future and its capability to grow as a sport			1
" when i first set up @entity201 i knew a lot of people would want to play the sport , and i knew i would n't be alone in liking the idea of playing football on a golf course , " he said			2
" but i was always conscious of the next level			0
" i knew it would take off with adults , but we started looking at how the sport could continue to grow and grow			0
and if you get the youngsters involved you 're going to still be going in 10 , 20 , 30 years ' time , and you 'll be continuing to build , develop and progress			0
" much to @entity19 's surprise , since its introduction , the sport seems to have struck a particular chord with junior football coaches			0
there has been an overwhelming response from these coaches , who have contacted @entity45 @entity11 to explain that the game is the perfect way to help youngsters focus on their passing and shooting			1
so much so , that the governing body has taken the steps to set up its very own @entity45 @entity231 , due to start for business in may , and headed up by @entity92 , who previously played for @entity233 , @entity234 and @entity235 and is now a player - assistant manager at @entity237			1
the scheme is currently being worked on with @entity45 - based 1st4sport -- who develop training qualifications for the likes of the @entity242 and the @entity243 -- and will range from including holiday camps for kids to qualification courses for future coaches			1
@entity92 will take on the role of academy director , and like @entity19 , he feels the scheme can help to push the boundaries of @entity201 even further			0
" the concept of @entity11 is something that really appeals to me and i 'm sure there is a massive amount of people that would really want to get involved with the @entity231			1
the potential there is huge and it is something that i 'm really looking forward to , " @entity92 said			0
" i do n't think a lot of kids get the right sort of education when it comes to sport , i think they just want to kick the ball against a wall nowadays			0
they need direction and for somebody to really push them a little , to get them right up there and become the best they really can be			0
the scheme will give you that platform			0
" as well as furthering the profile of the sport , the @entity231 will be hoping to produce some of the @entity280 of tomorrow			0
a tour de force the @entity282 currently stages a @entity283 , with each of its different 22 member nations holding their own tournament throughout the year			1
some of the world 's finest players go from competition to competition looking to accumulate points , before a @entity293 champion is eventually crowned at the final stage in @entity295 in november			2
" players travel from country to country because they love @entity11 and they love trying different courses , " @entity19 said			1
" there 's quite a small , but cult , following of people that do this			0
they all want to get ranked and be known as a good @entity306 , not just in their own country but around the world			2
" there are also a number of domestic tournaments taking place each year on various courses across the globe			2
the @entity132 currently leads the way when it comes to different courses with 90 , while the @entity45 , now boasting 30 , has made impressive progress to move up to second , given it had just two at the beginning of 2013			1
with @entity11 continuing to make huge strides both at home and abroad , @entity19 has high hopes for the sport and feels the sky is most certainly the limit			1
" in five years ' time , every country in the world that has got golf courses will be a member of the @entity22 , " @entity19 said			1
" with the amount of inquiries we are getting from all over the place , i have no doubt about that			0
" we 've got somebody in @entity340 asking us about joining the @entity22			1
they 've only got one golf course in @entity340 , and they 're talking about putting @entity11 on it ! that 's how big an impact the sport is having around the world			1
