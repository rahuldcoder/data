-- maybe your mother told you it 's not polite to stare			0
it was n't safe either , @entity5 said , for those who looked at thursday 's partial solar eclipse			1
" do n't stare , " @entity5 said			2
" even at maximum eclipse , a sliver of sun peeking out from behind the @entity10 can still cause pain and eye damage			0
direct viewing should only be attempted with the aid of a safe solar filter			0
" the show in the sky reached its height at 5:45 p.m. et , @entity5 said , meaning the eastern half of the country should have gotten a view before the backdrop of golden twilight hues			1
the moon clipped the sun and should have made it look like a fingernail as it set in the west for most of the country and @entity32			0
people living in the @entity34 had the best view , @entity5 said			1
@entity36 and @entity37 will miss out on this one			1
the eclipse was expected to last for over two hours			0
protect your eyes @entity5 urged people viewing the eclipse to protect their eyes			1
@entity5 suggested some old tricks for viewing indirectly , like punching a hole in cardboard and projecting the light seeping through it onto a surface away from the sun. or letting a tree do the work for you : " overlapping leaves create a myriad of natural little pinhole cameras , each one casting an image of the crescent - sun onto the ground beneath the canopy , " @entity5 said			2
if you missed this one , the next solar eclipse over @entity60 will occur in about three years -- and it will be a more dramatic and rare total eclipse .			0
