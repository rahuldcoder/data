-- polygamy is back in the headlines			2
last week , a federal judge in @entity4 struck down part of the state 's anti-polygamy law as unconstitutional , although he kept the ban on possessing more than one marriage license at a time			1
fans of the " @entity14 " reality tv stars , who filed the suit , are rejoicing in the news			0
at the other end of the spectrum , @entity16 debuted its newest docuseries , " breaking the @entity20 , " which tells the dark story of women and children trying to escape from the practice			2
another lawsuit filed by the @entity26 alleges that polygamous clans are secretly running the show in @entity4 and @entity30 townships , manipulating the political process from behind the scenes			1
and in @entity34 , the attorney general 's office is inching closer to seizing a massive polygamous ranch			2
across the country , angry citizens are calling for the government to follow its own laws and crack down on polygamy			1
meanwhile , celebrities like @entity42 and various news outlets encourage people of all ages to reconsider plural marriage			0
what competing narratives about polygamy in @entity50 reveal is that whether or not a white - washed , clean - cut version of plural marriage could in theory legally exist , in practice it does not , and what states like @entity4 , @entity30 and @entity34 actually have is an unregulated , dangerous and harmful situation , where the strong prey upon the weak and helpless			1
the time has come to address this discrepancy			2
when the @entity61 struck down the federal @entity62 in @entity50 v. @entity63 in june , opening the door to federal recognition of same - sex marriage , it also set the stage for a discussion of plural marriage			1
@entity62 defined marriage as " a legal union between one man and one woman as husband and wife			2
" while @entity62 obviously prohibited same - sex marriage ( by requiring that a marital unit consist of a man and a woman ) , it also enshrined the prohibition against polygamy , by requiring that such a union be between only one man and one woman			2
even before @entity63 the @entity61 had declared morals - based legislation invalid , renewing interest in polygamy			0
but in calling @entity62 definitions unconstitutionally restrictive , the court , perhaps unwittingly , also struck down the federal numerical limitation in a marriage , immediately re-opening the possibility of plural marriage at the state level			1
activists have taken note , and are only getting louder			0
but despite the strength of any legal arguments , and the voices of a few , plural marriage is still a crime , and public opinion remains strongly in favor of the ban			0
studies show that it tends to create abusive relationships antithetical to family values			0
co-wives who lose favor are pushed aside for new and often younger rivals ; left to fend for themselves and their children with dwindling resources and support , they are exploited by emotionally detached husbands			0
advocates say the harms are not intrinsic to the practice ; they do not support underage or coercive relationships			0
they challenge us to crack down on abuses in general , irrespective of marital model			0
polygamy might not be inherently evil , which is why we need purposeful debates			0
but unlike traditional marriage , it has never been effectively regulated and so people , especially women and children , have suffered			0
the real beauty of last summer 's ruling is that it not only opened the door for polygamy , it also established a framework			1
same - sex relationships that were only decriminalized in earlier cases were finally given legal recognition in @entity63			1
if there is to be a change in status quo -- if we as a nation decide that polygamy can not or should not be illegal -- then going straight from criminalization to full recognition is both the correct legal answer and necessary to assuage public fears			1
decriminalizing polygamy would only make abuses even harder to catch			1
but following @entity63 's lead and allowing these relationships to be recognized could instead bring them into the light			1
recognition would enable law enforcement to crack down on abuse ; allow an independent civil authority -- a town clerk or justice of the peace -- to express concerns about and even refuse to approve an inappropriate marriage			1
it would help prosecutors overcome the evidentiary hurdles inherent in prosecuting related crimes			0
unlike decriminalization , legalizing and regulating polygamy cuts to the heart of policy concerns			0
morals - based legislation has been unconstitutional since 2003 's @entity174 , and so we can not just continue ignoring the polygamists ' clamor for acceptance			1
but the practical policy solution -- awarding those formerly banned relationships rights , and with those rights accompanying duties and responsibilities , which will be monitored -- was only handed down last summer			0
a clean - cut version of @entity50 polygamy does not currently exist , but under @entity63 , perhaps , we could actually build it			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity189 .			2

a judge in @entity4 struck down part of the state 's anti-polygamy law as unconstitutional
@entity189 : in practice , polygamy exists even if legally it is not recognized
he says @entity50 needs to address polygamy , possibly find a way to make it legal
@entity204 : recognition would enable law enforcement to crack down on abuse
