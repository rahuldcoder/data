@entity1 , @entity0 -- football fans in the @entity4 are ushering in a potential new age of football ownership after plotting a takeover bid for @entity9 @entity8			1
fan property ? @entity8 supporters are plotting a takeover of the club			1
the @entity15 organization is a collective of fans looking to raise enough money to make a serious takeover bid at the club			1
they are seeking 100,000 people to invest $ 7,000 to raise $ 700m that will allow them to take over from the current owners @entity26 and @entity27			0
the group plan to have their own fan parliament , fan board and an employed board in charge of the club			1
but can absolute fan ownership be considered a serious contender to the existing business model ? in the case of @entity8 , the group appears to be making progress -- after releasing an ' open letter ' to the owners inviting them to discuss the purchase of @entity8			1
do you own shares in a football club ? would you want to own and run your team ? @entity26 and @entity27 completed a $ 490 million refinancing deal with @entity4 and @entity49 banks in january -- saddling the club with annual interest repayments of $ 42 million , part of the reason why fans are so keen to take over the running of their beloved club			1
across @entity59 the practice of fans owning is fairly common , particularly in @entity60 where @entity61 is a supporter - owned club run by around 150,000 of its fans			1
@entity65 -- the most successful team in @entity60 football -- and @entity61 also belong to members called " socios			0
" in the @entity4 , the move of football fans toward club ownership has been propelled by the threat of overseas owners taking charge and making decisions not favored by the local fans			1
football governance expert and management lecturer at the @entity80 , dr @entity81 , said the reason fans often get involved is to make sure clubs are being " run as effectively and sustainably as possible			2
" @entity81 said some @entity9 sides , including @entity86 , had a small percentage of shares owned by the club , while smaller clubs @entity91 , @entity92 and @entity93 were among the teams where fans had a larger stake			1
many of those fans were assisted by @entity99 , an organization that helps supporters ' trusts from numerous clubs buy shares and have representation at their clubs			1
however , at the greatest extreme of fan ownership is @entity0 conference side @entity107			1
in 2008 , the club was taken over by more than 30,000 individuals through web site @entity110			2
each shareholder paid Â£ 35 ( $ 48 ) to have their say in the club for a year , and could vote on decisions like team selections and ticket prices			2
according to @entity120 , chief executive of @entity107 , the model has had a few teething problems -- but he feels it could be sustainable			2
the club had recently lost many members at the one - year renewal , with numerous people citing the recession as the reason for their departure , he said			0
" we originally had 30,000 people , " he told @entity2			0
" we expected to lose a considerable number of these after a year and now we are down to a core of about 10,000			0
" the very positive thing is that we have this solid core of people who are in it for the longer term			0
if we can get through this season i think we have conquered it			0
it 's a sustainable model , " he said			0
@entity120 said some members got involved with voluntary work at the club and he was surprised at the interests many shareholders had			0
" i think it 's still evolving			0
it 's very clear people are in it for different reasons			0
some are in it to pick the team , while others are happy just to try to help out at the club and talk of their frustration with the ' fat cat ' clubs			2
" there has been a surprising interest in the business side of it rather than the football side of things , " @entity120 said			0
@entity81 disagrees with @entity120 ' optimism for @entity107 , saying fan ownership is possible , but its best derived from within the club 's own fan - base			1
@entity81 felt the @entity15 model and the concept promoted by @entity99 , were more sustainable as they were geared towards fans of the club			2
it would be more difficult to retain interest under the @entity107 model where anyone could pay the money and become an owner , he said			1
" because they allow anybody to buy a share			0
if you 're not a supporter of that club , do you really have an attachment to that club ? "			0

@entity8 fans are hoping to pool enough money to take over the club
many clubs have small or large stakes of shares owned by supporters
@entity4 club @entity107 is owned by an *online* fan *community*
