@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 's attorney general questioned wednesday whether the federal government has the legal right to ask for data from school districts in the state , which has recently passed controversial legislation intended to reduce illegal immigration			1
in a letter sent wednesday , attorney general @entity11 said he was " perplexed and troubled " about a request from the @entity14 for information about @entity1 's schools			1
the @entity14 issued the letter tuesday to @entity1 school districts to ensure they are complying with federal law , which declares that a child may not be denied equal access to schools based on his or her immigration status			1
@entity11 's letter noted that the law was still being litigated			1
@entity11 set a friday noon deadline for @entity27 , assistant attorney general for @entity14 's civil rights division , to provide the legal authority for his request			1
last spring , the @entity1 legislature passed the law known as @entity32 relating to illegal immigration and a federal judge allowed most of its provisions to go into effect , including a mandate for public schools to ask about the immigration status of students enrolling in the system			1
the @entity42 granted the @entity14 's request for an emergency injunction for that section of the law but allowed other controversial parts to continue being enforced			1
justice urges @entity1 schools ' compliance on immigrant laws the @entity51 sent a memorandum to school districts recommending they wait for resolution of the issue between the state attorney and @entity14 before responding to the @entity14 request			1
in the days following the implementation of @entity32 , the number of latino students skipping class spiked			0
@entity61 , communication manager for the @entity51 , said the number of @entity64 absentees has since leveled off but remains several hundred higher than normal			0
the @entity51 also released enrollment numbers for the current school year showing an overall decrease in the student population but a 2.8 percent increase in @entity64 students , who represent some 35,000 of the state 's 740,000 students			0
@entity73 said the state tried to inform the districts of possible changes related to @entity32 while stressing that no student should be denied enrollment regardless of legal status			0
" if everyone sticks exactly to what the law asks from them and they do n't go beyond , then there should not be any danger to the education of all students that are welcomed , no matter what , " @entity73 said			0
@entity91 , the @entity92 's legal director in @entity1 , said she is happy the @entity14 is asking state educators to do what they can to prevent @entity64 students from becoming discouraged about attending school			1
" we want to make sure students have the right to their education , " @entity96 said			0
@entity73 said the state sent letters to the schools and to students ' parents before and after the law was enacted to prevent confusion			2
the @entity92 declined to comment on @entity11 's response to the @entity14 request			1
officials at @entity111 have tried to encourage parents to keep their children in our schools and have told them their children would not be affected by the immigration law , said @entity118 , the schools ' director of communications , in a statement			1
" on the heels of the court decision allowing the law to go into effect , we sent an automated call to all parents explaining that no information would be collected regarding children who already were enrolled			2
the call went out in @entity128 to our @entity64 families			0
" the @entity130 sent @entity128 - speaking teachers to areas with large numbers of @entity134 to encourage the families to continue to send their kids to school			0
at @entity142 , a mobile home park on the outskirts of @entity0 , parents awaiting the return of their kids from school said they were not aware that some parents were keeping their children home out of fear of the law			2
a @entity149 woman in the @entity150 without legal papers said she had left from @entity152 with her eighth - grade son when the state started talking about a similar law and was considering leaving @entity1 , too			2
" i hear they are looking for farm workers in @entity158 , " she said			0
but , she added , she had never considered taking her child out of school			0
@entity73 said the number of students withdrawn from state schools will not be known for months because the schools have not received official notification from the families about permanently removing their kids			0
she said the department will continue to work to ensure all children in @entity1 continue to be educated			2
" we are here to educate the children but have to follow every law that is passed and active , " @entity73 said			2
@entity2 's @entity172 and @entity173 contributed to this story			0
