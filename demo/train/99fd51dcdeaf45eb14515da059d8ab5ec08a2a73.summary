inked on @entity2 teenager @entity1 's arm are the words : " there 's nothing worse in life than being ordinary			1
" @entity8 got a taste of the 18 - year - old @entity1 's pursuit of the extraordinary as the @entity2 pulled off one of the biggest upsets of his nascent tennis career with a straight sets victory over the world no. 3			1
few had given @entity1 much chance of winning the pair 's quarterfinal contest at the @entity18 , his last victory against a top - 10 ranked player dating back to a historic win over @entity22 at the end of 2014			1
@entity24 had played a part in @entity1 's path to the last eight after he had initially lost to 350th - ranked @entity28 in qualifying and he only snuck into the tournament by virtue of a lucky - loser berth			1
but in a thoroughly one - sided quarterfinal contest , the teen served up a 6 - 1 , 6 - 3 victory as @entity8 struggled to make inroads with 55 unforced errors			2
runner - up at the @entity39 last month , @entity8 mustered just 38 points in the 80 - minute match			2
the @entity42 was in @entity43 without coach @entity44 and had previously admitted to struggling to find playing partners			1
but he made no excuses in the aftermath of his defeat			0
" he did n't make any errors , " @entity8 told the @entity50 @entity50 website			0
" he played very solid and he moved well			0
i made way too many mistakes from the beginning of the match right through to the end , early in the rallies , rushing points			0
" it was a far cry from the pair 's last encounter in a @entity63 tie in 2013			0
prior to that contest , @entity1 had admitted he had no chance of victory			2
but the world no. 84 has grown noticeably in confidence , saying in a recent interview that he was " the best of his generation			0
" @entity1 has been tipped for a place among the world 's top 10 and @entity8 , for one , has noticed the improvement			1
" he makes good decisions on the court , he 's stronger now , he serves a bit better , " said @entity1			2
" his ranking would suggest that he 's made some big improvements			0

18 - year - old @entity1 beats @entity8 in straight sets in @entity43 quarter - final
it is only the teenager 's second career victory over a top - 10 player after earlier win over @entity22
@entity8 , without his coach @entity44 in @entity43 , is full of *praise* for his *vanquisher*
