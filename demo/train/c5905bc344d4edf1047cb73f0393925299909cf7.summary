-- wait -- we were n't done pondering the @entity2 720			0
so what , if anything , is " xbox 8 " ? the real , no - fun , answer is " maybe nothing			1
" but it 's been enough to kick up a round of speculation among tech and gaming enthusiasts after @entity14 fought , and won , against a cybersquatter who had grabbed the web address for that name			1
the @entity18 , which handles international business disputes , ruled in @entity14 's favor in a complaint against a @entity23 national who had filed for a whole host of addresses representing both current and imagined products			1
they included @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 and @entity32			0
@entity14 filed the complaints in may			1
tech site @entity34 reports that the domains listed in the disputes were ordered transferred to @entity14 in late june after two separate panels found the man who filed for them had no rights to the domains and that they were being used " in bad faith			2
" the inclusion of " xbox 8 " may have just been a matter of @entity14 gaining control over anything that looks as if it should be theirs			1
but its inclusion alongside other names that are easier to explain sparked speculation online tuesday about what the name might mean			0
many observers immediately wondered whether it might be the name of the next @entity2 gaming and entertainment console			2
@entity14 is widely expected to roll out a new version of its popular @entity61 console within the next year			1
the name most people expect ? @entity2 720			0
last month , a 56 - page document from @entity14 was leaked			2
dating back to mid- 2010 , the document contained plans for an " @entity2 " that utilizes the new @entity67 system and new hardware for its @entity70 motion - recognition system			0
perhaps a better guess is that " @entity2 " could be software			0
@entity74 8 promises to be a massive overhaul of the operating system that will marry pcs with tablets and smartphones			2
it stands to reason that the @entity2 will be included and " xbox 8 " would make sense in this regard			1
of course , imagining a new console is more exciting			0
" @entity2 ? did n't know the @entity61 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 and 7 came out , " one @entity86 user wrote			0
alas , says gaming site @entity87 : " it 's tempting to suspect @entity14 is eyeing ' @entity2 ' as the next console name due to the two domains that reference it ; however , @entity14 already began integrating @entity93 , and the ' @entity2 ' name , into all its consumer products , including @entity96			1
also , it would be really weird if a domain squatter guessed the name			0

@entity14 *secures* web addresses for " xbox 8 "
a @entity23 cybersquatter had grabbed that domain and others
some wonder whether xbox 8 is the name of the next console
with @entity96 on the way , the name could *suggest* a *connection*
