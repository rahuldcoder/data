no matter what you call it -- bonuses , incentives , market or performance pay -- the @entity7 gave out a lot to senior managers in recent years despite sometimes deadly waits for health care and other problems faced by @entity14 veterans			1
a top @entity16 official confirmed to a congressional committee on friday that 78 % of @entity16 senior managers qualified for extra pay or other compensation in fiscal year 2013 by receiving ratings of " outstanding " or " exceeds fully successful , " and that all 470 of them got ratings of " fully successful " or better			1
such widespread laudatory performance appraisals occurred shortly before @entity25 started reporting in november how veterans waited excessive periods for @entity16 health care , with some dying in the process			1
the @entity16 has acknowledged 23 deaths nationwide due to delayed care			2
in @entity32 , @entity25 reported in april that the @entity16 used fraudulent record - keeping -- including an alleged secret list -- that covered up the waiting periods			2
a fatal wait : veterans languish and die on a @entity39 's secret list that did n't stop the head of the @entity16 medical center , @entity43 , from getting an $ 8,500 bonus last year			1
@entity43 's bonus got rescinded earlier this year after the @entity16 controversy made headlines			0
she was placed on administrative leave but continues to receive her salary , said @entity51 , the @entity16 assistant secretary for human resources and administration , at a @entity55 hearing			1
questionable bonuses panel chairman @entity57 , a @entity59 @entity58 , cited numerous examples of what he characterized as unwarranted bonuses to @entity16 officials overseeing a department with such problems in recent years : the medical center director in @entity67 , @entity68 , receiving a bonus exceeding $ 10,000 despite an investigation of veterans getting exposed to hepatitis b and c at the facility ; the former director of the @entity16 regional office in @entity77 , @entity78 , getting more than $ 53,000 in bonuses when the average processing time for disability claims increased to what @entity57 called " inexcusable levels			1
" the director of the @entity86 health care system getting a top performance review and a regional director getting a $ 63,000 bonus despite a legionella outbreak in the @entity92 health care system that led to six patient deaths			0
" to the average @entity14 , $ 63,000 is considered to be a competitive annual salary , not a bonus , " @entity57 said			0
@entity51 offered administrative explanations about the bonus system that did little to satisfy committee members			0
in particular , the @entity43 case in @entity32 got a lot of attention , with legislators from both parties asking how it could happen			0
she explained how the bonus should never have been given because @entity43 was being investigated in connection with the problems at the @entity16 facility , and therefore the extra money was eligible to be rescinded			2
ca n't go back however , @entity51 said in almost all other cases , a performance rating and resulting bonus ca n't be rescinded later on			0
" if we knew what we knew today at that time , it is unlikely that their performance would have reflected what it reflected at the time the reports were written , " she said when asked by @entity57 about going back to change the performance review results			1
however , " you can not go back and change a rating once it has been issued to an employee as the final rating , " @entity51 said , adding that was the law rather than a government rule			0
an exasperated @entity57 called it a law that needed to change as part of an overhaul of a culture throughout the va motivated more by performance bonuses than serving veterans			1
" we ca n't keep doing it the way it 's been being done , " he said , to which @entity51 responded : " i concur , mr. chairman			0
" the controversy , with multiple investigations and increasing revelations of problems with newly returned veterans getting care on a timely basis , caused retired @entity148 gen. @entity147 to resign on may 30 as @entity7 secretary			2
@entity150 kept the @entity16 scandal his successor , interim secretary @entity152 , has ruled out any bonuses for senior managers in 2014 as part of initial steps intended to get more immediate care for hundreds of thousands of waiting veterans			1
updated figures earlier this week , an updated audit revealed about 177,000 veterans were still waiting at least two months for an appointment at @entity16 medical centers			1
@entity152 said some of the delays on the audit update appeared worse than previously reported because hospital administrators were beginning to use proper scheduling procedures that accurately reflected the number of veterans waiting			1
for example , the update showed more than 43,000 veterans waiting longer than 120 days for an appointment , compared to 13,000 listed earlier this month			0
according to @entity152 , more appointments have been added , but some @entity16 hospitals lack the capacity to see patients quickly , which also contributed to a spike in the figures			0
the @entity16 has reached out to 70,000 veterans waiting for appointments in order to get them into clinics , he said			2
at this point , the @entity16 's @entity186 is investigating 69 facilities for allegations that administrators altered appointment data or used secret waiting lists to make patient wait times appear shorter in order to earn financial bonuses			1
@entity51 said friday that schedulers sought to meet their performance goal -- and therefore qualify for bonuses -- by showing veterans got appointments within 14 days			0
an internal audit by the @entity16 called that 14 - day goal implemented under @entity147 's leadership unattainable and reported 13 % of schedulers were instructed to manipulate data in some form			2
@entity152 has eliminated the 14 - day target for the @entity39 , which has more than 1,700 facilities that serve almost 9 million veterans each year			0

a @entity55 committee questions bonuses for @entity16 *workers* despite problems
rep. @entity57 says @entity16 culture put bonuses over caring for veterans
" i concur , " va official says when asked if change is needed
audit update shows hundreds of thousands of veterans wait for care
