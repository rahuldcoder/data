-- please bear with me as i ask you to briefly use your imagination			0
imagine @entity6 at dawn cloaked in fog			1
now imagine the fog slowly lifting to reveal an enormous ancient city perched on the edge of a mountain			2
picture a sense of mystery being immersed in thousands of years of history as you walk between antiquated hewn stone structures			0
there is tranquility in the wind - blown stillness of the primeval site			1
you feel a renewed sense of kinship with the past and with your ancestors and feel a deep reverence for their lives and accomplishments			0
now imagine the menacing sound of bulldozers closing in and men at work			0
their heavy machinery rattles the ground			0
you hear workers rigging dynamite to these massive stone structures			0
there is a brief lull and then the deafening blow of multiple explosions as @entity6 is razed to the ground			1
be at ease , @entity6 is a @entity45 protected site			1
but a very similar 2,600 - year - old @entity48 site in @entity50 province , @entity46 is n't so lucky			1
this site is called @entity52 and is nothing short of awe - inspiring : a massive walled - in @entity48 city featuring massive temples , monasteries , and thousands of @entity48 statues that managed to survive looters and the @entity59			1
holding a key position on the @entity61 , @entity52 was also an international hub for traders and pilgrims from all over @entity65			1
hundreds of fragile manuscripts detailing daily life at the site are still yet to be excavated			0
beneath the @entity48 dwellings is an even older yet - unearthed bronze age site indicated by several recent archaeological findings			1
@entity52 is set for destruction at the end of december 2012			2
all of the temples , monasteries , statues as well as the bronze age material will all be destroyed by a @entity79 government - owned company called @entity80 ( @entity81 )			1
six villages and the mountain range will also be destroyed to create a massive open - pit style copper mine			1
in 2007 , @entity81 outbid competitors with a $ 3 billion bid to lease the area for 30 years			0
@entity81 plans to extract over $ 100 billion worth of copper located directly beneath the @entity48 site			1
ironically , the @entity90 were also mining for copper albeit in a more primitive fashion			0
@entity81 says they were n't told about the archaeology site 's existence until after the contract was signed			2
following significant international pressure and perhaps sensing an impending pr nightmare , @entity81 in 2009 gave archaeologists three years to attempt to excavate the site			0
archaeologists say they need at least 30 years to do the job but had no choice but to accept @entity103 brief timetable			0
specialists on site are working with extremely limited funding and the crudest of tools			0
@entity46 archaeologists , who do the majority of the excavation , do n't have access to computers or digital cameras and have been sleeping on the floor in a wooden shack when staying on the site overnight			1
today , three teams of international archaeologists led by @entity120 , a @entity122 archaeological delegation , scramble to save as many relics as they can			0
these experts are performing rushed rescue archeology , which focuses on removing movable objects and not on preserving structures			0
archaeologists now have less than four months to do three decades worth of excavation			0
they are also risking their lives daily as locals of @entity50 , angry at the loss of their villages partner with the @entity59 to regularly attack both the @entity81 site and the archaeology location with rockets and land mines			0
in july , a @entity50 worker unearthed a landmine that exploded in his face			0
later that month , four @entity46 policemen were killed by a landmine on the road leading to the archaeology site			1
i am often asked , " why save it ? it is , after all , just another remnant of the past , right ? " wrong			0
@entity52 is the missing link that shows @entity46 's interconnectivity throughout @entity65 on the @entity61			1
@entity46 needs to see the value of learning its own cultural history as too often the country 's story is co-opted by the lens of another			1
@entity46 need to claim their cultural significance in the world for current and new generations			2
and the findings at @entity52 will be the key to doing that			2
in addition to @entity52 's historical significance , the site is breathtaking to behold in person			1
i ca n't help but feel privileged and honored to have been able to set foot inside its ancient walls , to have been able to bare witness to massive @entity171 , many of which are still coated in gold paint overlooking their ancient city			2
these statues have miraculously survived looting , survived the intense heat and cold , and survived over three decades of continuous war			0
there is a magic to @entity52 -- an ability to draw in people from around the world who will risk their lives to save it			2
i fell in love with this ancient site and will do everything in my power to try to help save it			1
it sickens me to know that in a short time this site will be destroyed in the same violent and disrespectful way the @entity196 of @entity197 was destroyed			2
this desecration shows no reverence to culture or religion			0
imagine someone bulldozing your grandparents ' graves and blowing up their cemetery			0
how could the world look away letting such crime happen in the name of capitalism ? unfortunately , @entity52 has gained some powerful enemies			2
@entity81 , @entity213 and @entity46 ministries all want mining to start asap			2
in my opinion , they want @entity52 to set a precedent -- to be a model for resource extraction of the one trillion dollars plus of valuable minerals like oil , copper , lithium and iron buried underneath @entity46			1
according to archaeologists that i spoke with , every mining location holds cultural heritage			0
on every potential mine lies an ancient site like @entity52			1
so , even worse than the senseless destruction of @entity52 , is the thought that this kind of cheap destructive process will be replicated all across @entity46			1
i often hear talk about mineral extraction being somehow good for @entity46 , but i promise you this is not the case			2
given the country 's out of control corruption there are a privileged few who will see any payout from such endeavors			0
@entity46 citizens have absolutely nothing to gain from this copper mine or any other international extractive industry			1
i believe @entity79 will bring in their own laborers to manage the mine and @entity46 will be given only low level and terribly paid positions working in slave - like conditions			1
and i have said nothing about the environmental devastation			0
many mining experts have told me the toxic pollution from the mine will likely turn @entity52 into a site so toxic that in the future people will be advised against even setting foot on the ground			1
they tell me this pollution will be permanent , rivers will be polluted and the toxins will travel to other areas -- and the locals have never been educated about these risks to the area			0
so not only will @entity46 lose an ancient site , a key to unlocking its important history , but the country will lose the land and everything living on it			1
and what happens when @entity46 needs copper or oil or iron for its own development ? will they have to buy it back from @entity79 at inflated rates ? my fear is that in the future @entity46 will consist of hundreds of these gaping toxic craters and the resources the country needs for its own development will be lost			1
@entity46 will see no benefit			2
they will suffer from irreversible environmental devastation and the permanent loss of invaluable cultural heritage			0
so as a final request i want you to close your eyes once again			0
imagine a city - sized toxic crater in the ground where the majestic @entity6 once stood			1
that sight , unfortunately , is the future of @entity52 unless we do something to stop it .			2

@entity304 says the ancient site will be destroyed by plans to mine the area
a @entity79 company has *permission* to create a massive open - pit style copper mine
@entity304 : @entity52 is missing link showing @entity46 's historic role in @entity65
he says destroying @entity52 is equivalent to *wiping* @entity6 off the *map*
