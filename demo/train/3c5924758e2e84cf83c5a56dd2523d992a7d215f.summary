-- an @entity2 volcano exhibiting " elevated seismic activity " has spewed ash clouds skyward -- as high as 20,000 feet above sea level -- an observatory reported wednesday			1
as was the case a day earlier , the @entity7 was on " watch " status on wednesday because of heightened activity , and it was also under an orange code that relates to how its rumblings might affect planes flying over its summit			1
both these alert levels are the second most serious out of four options , according to the @entity18			0
the same alert levels also continue to apply wednesday to the @entity20 , which like @entity7 is in the @entity22 range southwest of mainland @entity2			1
@entity23 was reported flowing tuesday at @entity7 and @entity24			0
" they are very similar , and both have the ability to erupt , " @entity25 , a scientist from the @entity26 , said this week			0
@entity7 is the higher of the two volcanoes , reaching to 8,261 feet , and the one that is connected to the @entity2 mainland			1
the @entity18 's wednesday update noted persisting " elevated seismic activity " as well as reports of steam and ash clouds			0
web camera images show the plume " rising occasionally up to about 20,000 feet above sea level , " the same height at which a pilot on wednesday reported a " dark ash cloud " stretching east - northeast			1
the volcano observatory also reported a " diffuse ash plume " on tuesday night at an altitude of 15,000 feet and visible downwind for up to 100 miles			1
five climbers killed in @entity51 after deadly volcanic ash blast surface temperatures at the 5,676 - foot high @entity20 remained elevated over the past 24 hours , the observatory said , though there were no explosions detected by infrasound data in that time			2
the volcano observatory continues to warn that " sudden explosions of blocks and ash are possible with little or no warning			2
" the observatory said @entity24 could also produce ash clouds rising more than 20,000 feet above sea level			1
beyond any impact on fish , wildlife and humans , large ash clouds could negatively impact air travel			1
the @entity72 has issued a @entity73 , short for significant meteorological information , in areas around the volcanoes			2
after " eruptive activity " last year at the @entity20 , @entity79 scientist @entity78 said 90 % of air freight from @entity81 to @entity82 and @entity83 flies over @entity2 airspace , and hundreds of flights fly through @entity87 's air space daily			2
" we think of the @entity22 as being remote and desolate " @entity25 said , " but when you come up to 30,000 feet we are talking about 20 to 30,000 people there every single day			0
" @entity25 described @entity7 as " one of the most historically active volcanoes in the @entity93			0
" @entity24 is also " very active , " having last had a large eruption in 2001			0
imposing central @entity96 volcano spews ash skyward @entity0 's @entity98 contributed to this report .			0

new : @entity72 issues an *advisory* for areas around the volcanoes
an observatory reports ash plumes 20,000 feet above sea level over the @entity7
that and another @entity2 volcano remain on second highest alert status
an expert notes volcanic eruptions over @entity2 can seriously affect air travel
