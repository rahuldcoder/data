" the @entity0 is @entity2 's leading destination for brave thinking and bold ideas that matter			1
the @entity0 engages its print , online , and live audiences with breakthrough insights into the worlds of politics , business , the arts , and culture			2
with exceptional talent deployed against the world 's most important and intriguing topics , the @entity0 is the source of opinion , commentary , and analysis for @entity2 's most influential individuals who wish to be challenged , informed , and entertained			2
" -- the @entity0 2013 media kit for advertisers on monday , the @entity0 published -- and then pulled -- a story titled " @entity25 leads scientology to @entity27			1
" this " story " went on to feature the growth of @entity26 in 2012			1
any regular reader of the @entity0 's content would immediately do a double - take upon seeing that kind of headline , much less the heavy - handed text below it , shamelessly plugging how well @entity26 's " ecclesiastical leader " @entity25 has done in " leading a renaissance for the religion			1
" this " story " is one of several " advertorials " ( a portmanteau of " advertising " and " editorials " ) that the @entity0 has published online , clearly designated as " @entity42			1
" in other words , " stories " like these are n't real stories			0
they are ads with a lot of words , which advertisers have paid publications to run on their behalf for decades			0
you may have seen them in magazines and newspapers as " special advertising sections			0
" the hope is that because you are already reading the publication , hey , maybe you 'll read what the advertiser has to say , too -- instead of the " traditional " ad that they may have otherwise placed on the page that you probably wo n't remember , or worse , will ignore			0
there 's nothing wrong with this tactic , ethically , when clearly labeled as " sponsored " or " advertising			0
" but many took umbrage with the @entity0 in this particular case ; so many , that the @entity0 responded by pulling the story from its site -- which was the right thing to do -- and by apologizing			1
at face value , the @entity0 did the right thing for its business model , which depends upon advertising sales			2
it sold what they call a " native " ad to a paying advertiser , clearly labeled it as such , without the intention of misleading readers into thinking this was a piece of journalism			0
but it still failed on several levels			0
the @entity0 defines its readers as " @entity2 's most influential individuals who wish to be challenged , informed , and entertained			2
" by that very definition , it is selling " advertorials " to people who are the least likely to take them seriously , especially when heavy - handed			1
there is a fine line between advertorial and outright advertising copywriting , and this piece crossed it			0
the @entity94 is just as much at fault for thinking this piece would survive the @entity0 readers ' intellectual scrutiny			2
but this is n't even the real issue			0
bad advertising is all around us			0
and readers ' intellectual scrutiny would surely have let the advertorial piece slide without complaints ( though snark would be inevitable ) , as they have in the past , or yes , even possibly ignored it			0
but here 's where the @entity0 crossed another line -- it seemed clear it was moderating the comments beneath the advertorial			1
as the @entity114 reported , the @entity0 marketing team was carefully pruning the comments , ensuring that they were predominantly positive , even though many readers were leaving negative comments			1
so while the @entity0 was publishing clearly labeled advertiser - written content , it was also un-publishing content created by its readers -- the very folks it exists to serve			1
it 's understandable that the @entity0 would inevitably touch a third rail with any " new " ad format			1
but what it calls " native advertising " is actually " advertorial			0
" it 's not new at all			0
touching the third rail in this case is unacceptable			0
so what should the @entity0 have done in this situation before it became a situation ? for starters , it should have worked more closely with the @entity94 to help create a piece of content that was n't so clearly written as an ad			1
if the @entity94 was not willing to compromise its advertising to be better content , then the @entity0 should not have accepted the advertising			1
but this is a quality - control issue			0
the real failure here was that comments should never have been enabled beneath this sponsored content unless the advertiser was prepared to let them be there , regardless of sentiment			1
it 's not like @entity26 has avoided controversy in the past			2
the sheer , obvious reason for this advertorial in the first place was to dispel beliefs that @entity26 was n't a recognized religion ( hence " ecclesiastical " )			0
whether the @entity0 felt it was acting in its advertiser 's best interest , or the advertiser specifically asked for this to happen , letting it happen at all was a huge mistake , and a betrayal of an implicit contract that should exist between a publication of the @entity0 's stature and its readership			1
no matter how laughably " sales - y " a piece of sponsored content might be , the censoring of readership should be the true " third rail , " never to be touched			1
going forward , the @entity0 ( and any other publication that chooses to run sponsored content ) should adopt and clearly communicate an explicit ethics statement regarding advertorials and their corresponding comments			1
this statement should guide the decisions it makes when working with advertisers , and serve as a filter for the sponsored content it chooses to publish , and what it recommends advertisers submit			2
it should also prevent readers from being silenced if given a platform at all			0
as an advertising professional , i sincerely hope this does n't spook the @entity0 or any other publication from experimenting with ways to make money			2
but as a reader , i hope it leads to better ads that reward me for paying attention , rather than muzzle my voice should i choose to interact with the content			0
after all , what more could a publication or advertiser ask for than for content to be so interesting that someone actually would want to comment on ( or better , share ) it ? ( correction : an earlier version of this article incorrectly said native advertising accounts for 59 % of the @entity0 's ad revenue			1
digital advertising , of which native advertising is a part , accounts for 59 % of the @entity0 's overall revenue , according to the company			2

the @entity0 published and pulled a sponsored @entity26 " story "
@entity213 : on several levels , the ad was a mistake
he says the content was heavy - handed and comments were being moderated
@entity213 : experimenting to raise revenue makes sense , but standards should be clear
