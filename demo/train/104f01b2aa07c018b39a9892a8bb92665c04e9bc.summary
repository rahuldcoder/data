@entity4 the breakup of a gun smuggling ring allegedly involving a current and former @entity3 employee has exposed what a @entity7 prosecutor described as an " egregious breach of security " at @entity4			1
@entity12 district attorney @entity11 said tuesday that the investigation was " deeply troubling " -- not only for the havoc the gun running unleashed on the streets but because of the vulnerability to acts of terrorism on air travel that it revealed			2
" if they can put guns on the plane this time , " he told reporters , " they could have easily put a bomb on one of those planes			2
" two men worked together to smuggle guns and ammunition on at least 20 flights from @entity4 to @entity7 from may to december , officials said			2
" we have an egregious breach of security " at @entity4 because airport employees " are not required to go through screening , " said @entity11			1
in total , 153 guns were recovered as part of a complex investigation that @entity11 outlined by using charts and surveillance video during a press conference in @entity7			1
@entity47 , who worked for @entity3 at the @entity4 airport , was arrested at his home in @entity4 on monday , authorities said			1
according to @entity47 's arrest warrant affidavit , here 's how the operation worked : -- @entity47 used his security clearance to help provide guns to a passenger named @entity56 after @entity56 cleared security			1
-- @entity56 , the former employee , allegedly brought the firearms in his carry - on luggage on at least five flights from @entity4 to @entity7 between may 1 and december 10			1
-- during that time frame , @entity56 supplied 129 handguns and two assault rifles to co-conspirators in @entity7 , the affidavit states			0
-- one of those co-conspirators ended up selling the firearms to an undercover @entity7 police officer			2
" gun violence is tearing our country apart , " @entity11 said			0
" in @entity12 , far too many people have been victims of gun violence			0
" @entity73 , spokesperson for the @entity4 airport , said officials have cooperated with the @entity76 , the @entity77 and other agencies and was reviewing its security			1
" as part of the @entity77 - and airport - approved multi-layered security plan , all employees must pass extensive criminal history record checks , security threat assessments , and security training prior to being approved for access to secured areas , " he said in a statement			1
" additionally , employees are subjected to continuous vetting and random inspections			2
" in a statement , the @entity77 said it took " the potential for insider threats at airports very seriously			0
" " @entity77 administers security threat assessments and airport criminal checks for all airline employees prior to receiving credentials and access privileges , " the statement said			1
" this is a recurring vetting process that involves random checks			0
@entity77 continues to closely partner with law enforcement on this investigation and , where possible , will use the findings from the investigation to improve current processes			2
" @entity11 praised @entity3 for being cooperative from start to finish of the undercover probe			1
@entity56 was arrested in @entity7 on december 10 after landing at @entity118 with 18 handguns in his bag -- seven of which were loaded , the affidavit says			0
" the problem at this airport in @entity4 is that the employees do n't have to go through screening , " @entity11 said			1
@entity56 would give @entity47 the guns outside the airport			1
all he had to to was badge himself in ... and he 's in the terminal with the guns			0
" @entity56 told investigators that he had flown from @entity4 to @entity7 with the 18 firearms and associated ammunition in his carry - on bag , @entity76 task force agent @entity132 wrote in the affidavit			1
@entity77 seizes record number of firearms so how could a man get more than a dozen guns on a flight in his carry - on backpack ? " had the eighteen firearms been inside the @entity148 bag when @entity56 passed through @entity77 screening , the firearms would have been discovered , " @entity132 wrote			1
" accordingly , i reasonably believe the eighteen firearms bypassed security			0
" the ' backdoor method ' @entity152 , a @entity5 aviation analyst , said the suspects apparently " took advantage of known loopholes " in airport security			1
baggage handlers and other airport employees do n't have to go through a concourse screening as passengers do , creating a " backdoor method " for airport employees to smuggle materials , she said			1
" that 's literally been a loophole since 2002 , " when the @entity77 was established , she said			0
" there was a big issue on cost			0
" when she was inspector general of the @entity169 for six years ending in 1996 , @entity152 raised the " same kind of warning " about the screening of airport employees			1
" this is an important wake - up call			1
i just hope @entity175 and the airports heed it , " she said			0
@entity152 said that " it will take a lot of expense and manpower to close that loophole			0
" at the news conference , @entity11 held one of the weapons allegedly smuggled by @entity56 -- an @entity183			0
" this gun can shoot through a car door , " he said			0
" it can shoot through an apartment door			0
it can shoot through a bullet - proof vest			0
in november , mr. @entity56 brought this gun on a @entity3 commercial airliner to @entity7			2
" transfer in men 's restroom ? on the morning of december 10 , the affidavit says , baggage handler @entity47 used his security clearance to enter @entity3 's employee parking lot and then the secure area of the airport			1
" employees entering this area are not subjected to screening by the @entity77 ( @entity77 ) , neither at the time of entry into the employee parking lot , nor upon entry to the internal secure / restricted area at @entity4 , " the affidavit states			1
surveillance video showed that on the same morning , the passenger @entity56 cleared security with a black @entity148 backpack			2
he then went to sit down at the airport 's @entity213 according to @entity132 , that 's when @entity56 started texting @entity47			0
moments later , @entity47 entered a men 's restroom in @entity213 and @entity56 followed			0
after one minute , the affidavit says , @entity56 walked out of the restroom with the backpack			2
gun packed in @entity221 gets passenger arrested the criminal complaint also says on several occasions this year , @entity47 used his security clearance to enter the secure @entity3 employee parking lot -- even though he was supposed to be off or on sick leave			1
and on each of those dates , @entity56 boarded a flight from @entity4 to @entity7			0
@entity3 spokesman @entity231 told @entity5 the airline is cooperating with authorities			2
" we take seriously any activity that fails to uphold our strict commitment to the safety and security of our customers and employees , " he said			2
@entity11 said @entity56 allegedly boarded 20 flights with guns between may and december			0
" we were fortunate that we were able to get all the guns that they tried to put on the streets of @entity12 , " he said			0
@entity246 tried to take on planes in 2013 @entity5 's @entity248 and @entity249 contributed to this report .			0
