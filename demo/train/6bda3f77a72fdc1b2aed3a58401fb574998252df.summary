-- @entity2 troops in @entity3 have been ordered to halt some joint operations with @entity3 security forces after a spate of attacks by their local allies and amid fallout from a controversial @entity11 video			1
" most partnering and advising will now be at the battalion level and above , " @entity13 press secretary @entity12 told reporters tuesday			0
" this does not mean there will be not partnering below that level			0
the need for that will be evaluated on a case - by - case basis			0
" but @entity12 stressed that the broader strategy of handing security over to local and national forces would continue and that the new policy will not effect @entity2 's planned withdrawal for 2014			1
" in response to an increased threat situation as a result of the ' @entity34 ' video , plus the recent insider attacks , @entity28 forces are increasing their vigilance and carefully reviewing all activities and interactions with the local population , " maj. @entity27 , a spokeswoman for the @entity2 - led @entity28 , said earlier tuesday			1
4 @entity2 troops killed in ' insider ' attack " we adjust our force protection measures based on the threat			1
if the threat level goes down , we could see a rolling back on this decision			0
" the " @entity34 " video , which was privately produced in the @entity47 , mocks the @entity48 as a womanizer , child molester and killer			2
the @entity47 government has condemned the video , which spurred deadly protests in several countries , including @entity3			1
on tuesday , for example , an insurgent group carried out a suicide attack that killed 12 people , including eight foreigners in @entity61 , saying it was in response to the film			2
the other factor behind the partial joint operations suspension is the number of " green - on - blue " attacks in the country			0
more than 50 coalition troops were killed between january and mid-august in instances where uniformed @entity3 turned their guns on allied troops			1
why asylum - seekers are fleeing @entity3 @entity2 's senior civilian representative in @entity3 , @entity75 called the need for the new policy a " bump in the road , " adding that " people in all of our countries would expect us ... to make sure that our soldiers are kept out of harms way as much as possible			1
" " the circumstances in which we have reduced our partnership operations are not ideal by any means at all , they are not what we would have wanted , " he said			0
" nor are they a great strategic set back			0
" on monday , the @entity92 said that @entity2 commander @entity94 gen. @entity93 had ordered commanders " to review force protection and tactical activities			1
" " while some partnered operations are temporarily suspended , many continue , and regional commanders have the authority to approve more , " @entity92 press secretary @entity99 said			2
@entity93 's guidance was given at the recommendation of key @entity3 leaders , @entity27 said			1
" this will likely lead to adjustments in exactly how , when and where @entity28 troops operate , especially during the current period of heightened tension , " she said			0
@entity114 defence secretary @entity113 , meanwhile , insisted tuesday that , " there has been no change of policy in @entity3 " for @entity114 forces			1
speaking to the @entity119 , @entity113 cited a press release issued by the @entity28 commander saying " some prudent , but temporary , measures to reduce our profile and vulnerability to civil disturbances or insider attacks " have been put into place			0
@entity113 echoed @entity12 's statement from the @entity13 , saying " partnering and advising " would take place at the battalion level and above			0
" the change does not mean that where will be no partnering below that level			0
the need for that will be evaluated on a case - by - case basis and approved by the regional commanders , " @entity113 added			0
over the weekend , four @entity47 and two @entity114 troops were gunned down in attacks believed to involve @entity3 police			1
in addition , insurgents disguised in @entity145 uniforms launched a coordinated assault friday at the joint @entity47 - @entity114 base @entity149 , raising concerns that the attackers had inside knowledge			2
that attack killed two @entity47 @entity94 and destroyed six @entity155 jets , international forces said			2
@entity149 is also where @entity114 's prince @entity157 is based			0
@entity157 was taken to a secure position after the perimeter at @entity149 had been breached , @entity114 defense secretary @entity113 told the @entity161			0
how insurgents entered prince @entity157 's base @entity47 defense secretary @entity164 said monday that he is " very concerned " about insider attacks			2
" this is an approach that the @entity167 is resorting to , similar to the use of ( improvised explosive devices ) , " @entity164 said			2
" we think , very frankly , that it is kind of a last - gasp effort to be able to not only target our forces but to try to create chaos because they have been unable to regain any of the territory that they have lost			0
" the halt in some joint operations with @entity3 forces comes weeks after @entity47 special operations forces suspended the training of some @entity184 recruits while it double - checks the background of the current police force			1
" @entity193 - on - blue " refers to a color coding system used by the military , in which blue refers to the friendly force and green refers to allied forces			0
the spate of green - on - blue attacks comes as @entity47 and @entity2 troops are training @entity3 soldiers and police to maintain security within the country ahead of the planned end of allied combat operations in 2014			1
it 's unclear what impact , if any , the earlier suspension in training and the temporary halt of some joint operations will have on the timetable to withdraw			0
@entity47 facing growing ' green - on - blue ' challenge in august , @entity93 estimated that about a quarter of the attacks were being carried out by infiltrators from the @entity167 , the @entity215 militia that ruled most of @entity3 before the @entity47 - led invasion in 2001			1
an earlier @entity92 review that said that about 10 % were by @entity167 forces that had sneaked into @entity3 military and police ranks			1
" it 's less about the precision of 25 versus 10 than it is acknowledging that the @entity167 are seeking ultimately to have some impact in the formation , " @entity93 said			1
@entity3 president @entity226 has blamed the attacks on foreign spy agencies hoping to undermine @entity3 security institutions , but he did not specifically identify any countries			2
@entity2 admits killing civilians in strike @entity0 's @entity233 , @entity234 and @entity235 contributed to this report .			2
