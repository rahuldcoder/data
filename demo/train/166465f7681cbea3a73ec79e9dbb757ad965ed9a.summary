-- @entity1 lived most of her childhood trapped in a body that could not communicate clearly with the outside world			1
she could n't speak and had few fine motor skills			2
she 'd been diagnosed with severe autism at age 2			0
even with the progress that has been made with therapy techniques and medication , @entity1 was still a mystery to her own family			1
who was she ? what would her voice be like if she could speak ? these were all questions that would go unanswered until @entity1 began to type			1
one day , during a session with one of her therapists , @entity1 began to feel sick			1
unable to speak to convey her condition , @entity1 went out on a limb and took the keyboard			1
" this would be the breakthrough that eventually allowed @entity1 to communicate with the outside world			1
a life without smartphones and other mobile devices would be hard to imagine for those of us who are phone - clutching , tablet - wielding mobile device addicts			2
how would we be able to live without @entity34 or @entity35 always in our pockets ? how could i check my bank account balance while i 'm out shopping ? but for @entity1 and many others like her these devices give so much more : a voice			1
the first - generation @entity43 was released in the @entity44 just after @entity1 's 15th birthday			1
her family immediately drove from their home in @entity49 to purchase one			0
they knew that the @entity43 would be a turning point for her to have freedom and the ability to communicate like never before			1
@entity1 began to type on a desktop computer at age 10 , but it was a difficult and slow progress , one letter at a time			1
" she finds typing extremely frustrating , " said her father , @entity59			0
" she wants a voice more than anything else			2
in her case , it 's even worse , because she has very severe @entity65 , and she gets anxious , and when she gets anxious , she freezes			0
it 's still frustrating that she ca n't get her thoughts and feelings out			0
" as @entity1 began to type more , her family and her therapists got to know her			1
she was a sharp - witted , bright girl who knew pop culture			0
she cracked jokes and poked fun at her brother , complaining about his teenage boy smell			0
she had her own sense of style			0
but most important , @entity1 was tenacious			1
she made it clear that she was willing to fight to achieve her goals			0
before the @entity43 , she tried several mobile communication devices			1
these tools had text - to - speak functionality , but she did n't really take to them			2
" she rejected her early communication devices like the @entity88 and the @entity89 because she felt they made her look disabled , " her parents said			0
" she does n't think of herself as disabled ; she thinks of herself as a kid with autism			0
but she does n't want that to define her			0
" for most people , the @entity43 opened a whole new way to send and receive information			1
it let us learn , communicate and socialize in a way we never had before			0
for @entity1 , the @entity43 was a game - changer for a much different reason			1
it gave her independence , and the apps made it easy to communicate her thoughts without painstakingly typing each letter on a computer			0
and because it was deemed " cool , " it was enticing to her			0
it did not make her feel different			0
as with any other teenager , @entity1 's " cool " points went up , and it helped her fit in			1
" it looked totally cool to be walking around with an @entity43 , and she much prefers that , " her father said			1
@entity1 says she loves her @entity43 and says , " thanks to it , i participate in class in a whole new way			1
" @entity1 now has two @entity43 and a laptop she uses regularly			1
the app she uses most is the fully customizable @entity116			1
when @entity1 goes to camp , for example , she can pre-load photos and words associated with camp to more efficiently communicate with her peers			2
the app comes at a steep price of $ 189.99			2
but the freedom and ease with which she can communicate clearly make it worthwhile			0
@entity1 and her father have written a book detailing her struggles and triumphs with autism			2
she has garnered the attention of celebrities and autism advocates like @entity135 , sen. @entity136 , @entity137 and @entity138			0
recently , she joined @entity136 on a panel to discuss how important technology is to those with autism			2
" technology has allowed me to communicate , learn social skills , implement relaxing techniques and played a crucial part in helping me how to spell , " she said			0
" to me , technology is the key to unlocking autism			0
" watch : @entity1 speaks with sen. @entity136 @entity34 , @entity147 and blogging also play a big part in @entity1 's ability to communicate with the world			2
she continues to amaze her family every day			0
her assistant , @entity153 , found a dialer attachment , and using that , @entity116 and a speakerphone , @entity1 can call friends			1
follow @entity1 on @entity34 her dad says that while @entity1 may not have the fine motor function to do things like tie her shoes , he hopes she will be able to attain more independence through technology			1
@entity1 says her next goal is to attend university			2
