@entity0 , @entity1 , researchers said			2
the van arrived at the @entity9 on thursday , after leaving @entity7 on july 20			1
the three - month trip took the van through @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14 ; across @entity1 through the @entity15 ; and finally along the @entity16 , before arriving for a celebration at the expo			1
the driverless van relied solely on electricity			1
see more of @entity2 's tech coverage the vehicle weathered three months of rain , blizzards and sun , and arrived in @entity26 with no major problems , according to researchers tracking its progress			2
the van even stopped to pick up hitchhikers outside of @entity33			1
" we are really happy			2
it 's a real milestone in our field of vehicular robotics , " said lead researcher @entity35			2
the van , designed by @entity7 tech company @entity40 , featured 12 refined sensors , including cameras , a carbon dioxide sensor , a gps device and an off - road laser scanner			1
" this driverless trip to @entity1 shows how science can capture people 's imagination through achievements that would recently have been unthinkable ... [ and ] provide major environmental and economic benefits , " said @entity46 , head of research , innovation and science for the @entity50			2

earlier this month , @entity62 announced that its self - driving vehicle had successfully traveled about 350 miles [ 563 kilometers ] from its headquarters in @entity65 , @entity66 , to @entity67 , @entity66			2
@entity62 , which engages in energy - related businesses along with its core internet search - engine service , says its self - driving cars have logged more than 140,000 miles			0
@entity71 , @entity72 and @entity73 are also developing driverless vehicles			0
no maps were used as @entity40 's van traveled from @entity7 , then off - road through much of @entity78 and @entity1			1
the van topped out at 37 miles per hour and traveled about four hours a day to allow for adequate battery recharging			1
as for human intervention during the van 's three - month journey , " we had to intervene manually only on limited occasions , such as in the @entity33 traffic jams and when passing toll stations , " said lead researcher @entity35 , who also is a professor at @entity7 's @entity88			1
two engineers rode in the van to prevent dangerous situations			1
the vehicle was part of a four - vehicle caravan , which included a leading van that was occasionally driven by two engineers , but mostly operated without human guidance			1
from @entity7 to @entity13 to @entity1 , the driverless van baffled onlookers			1
during a special demonstration on the outskirts of @entity33 on september 10 , a police officer approached the vehicle as it maneuvered in a pedestrian zone , only to find a driver missing			0
" he realized there was no driver ! " engineers wrote on the van 's official trip blog			1
" he then looked around and tried to find a clue of what was happening			0
he really seemed puzzled ! " " we talked to him ... explained this is a big test , " @entity35 said			0
" it was extremely difficult , but in the end we avoided getting the first ticket to an autonomous vehicle			0
" other challenges along the way included replacing a 430 - kilogram battery in @entity33 , lengthy and complicated border crossings due to customs clearances , and several frigid nights camping along the van 's route in @entity78			2
" we were n't worried about not making it , " though , @entity35 said			0
" this big trip was an intermediary step in a longer process			0
we have something new planned for 2012			0
" the @entity133 primarily funded the expedition , to develop technology to increase road safety and fuel efficiency by supplementing driver decisions at the wheel			0
the project used low - cost technologies that could be integrated in most current vehicles ' chassis , researchers said			0
more than 1.2 million people die annually in auto crashes , according to the @entity147 .			0
