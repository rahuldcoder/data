-- while @entity5 leader @entity4 may have provided the impetus for the 2001 @entity8 - led invasion of @entity9 , whose @entity11 - led government was harboring him , his death may have little impact on the continuing course of the war or on the continuing threat of terrorism , analysts said monday			1
" if the core issue was the @entity11 fighting for the right to protect @entity4 as their honored guest , then a big part of the war goes away , " said @entity18 , who served as chief of the @entity21 's @entity20 from 1991 - 95 and currently serves as president of the @entity23 in @entity24			2
but if the core issue has morphed into a civil war or a war between ethnic @entity9 against a foreign military force , then little has changed , he said			1
" all the issues that divide the ethnic groups are still there			1
" inside the raid that killed @entity4 @entity18 predicted that @entity4 's death will result in an immediate , short - term spike in motivation among his followers to carry out more terrorist attacks , but said any such spike will likely be short - lived as the information found in @entity4 's house leads investigators to track down other terrorists			1
@entity18 noted that @entity4 's influence was tough to find in the spawning of the " @entity54 , post-radical , nationalist and post-imperialist narrative " that spread this spring across the @entity56 and @entity57 world			2
" what we have is a growing population or political awareness that does n't care any more about those narratives , " @entity18 said			2
" that 's a whole lot more significant than whether or not @entity4 's holed up in a windowless building in @entity66			2
" but no one denied that the slain leader of @entity5 leaves a staggering legacy			1
" @entity4 's objective in 9/11 was to sucker us into an invasion of @entity9 with the idea that we 'd be bogged down there for a long time and would impoverish ourselves , " @entity18 said , noting that the @entity8 now faces a huge debt burden and has incurred tens of thousands of casualties			1
across the world , " his legacy is at least hundreds of thousands of dead people , the vast majority of whom were @entity82			1
" and he has also caused " very serious damage to @entity66 as a viable nation state , " @entity18 said			0
about @entity4 's death , " i do n't think it 's really going to have a significant impact on what 's going on in @entity9 , " said @entity86 , who worked for 17 years at the @entity21 , where he served as covert operations officer until he left at the end of the 1990s			1
what does the killing of @entity4 compare to ? asked about how @entity4 will be regarded in a decade , @entity86 said that , for a certain segment , " he 's always going to be a martyr and figurehead and legend and yadda yadda yadda			0
for the rest of the world , he 'll be thrown into the pile of mass murderers that have been consigned to history			0
" but @entity86 , who is now president of @entity105 , a global intelligence and security firm , said it would be naive for anyone to consider @entity4 's death to be a game changer in the global effort against terrorism			1
" they 've got the same operational capabilities that they had yesterday			0
" @entity115 , president of the @entity116 and author of " @entity118 of the @entity21 , @entity9 , and @entity4 , from the @entity119 to september 10 , 2001 , " predicted that no one will emerge to lead @entity5 " with the same kind of myths and spiritual presence and credibility " that @entity4 had among his followers			1
he too urged that it not be written off			0
" this is still a resilient militant organization , " he said			0
" a small number of people can do a lot of damage in this world			2
" @entity133 , a professor of international relations at @entity135 and a retired career officer with the @entity137 , said the raid on @entity4 's residence could have an impact on the conduct of the war in @entity9			1
" i do n't think this means anything like a rush to the exits in @entity9 , but i think there is an argument brewing about whether or not the tactics being employed in @entity9 are working or not , and this might arm the people in the camp that think that large - scale troop presence ends up being counterproductive , " he said			1
but over the long term , " i think his death is irrelevant , " @entity133 said			1
" what we call terrorism is an expression of resentment by @entity82 directed at @entity164 intervention , presence and meddling in the @entity57 world			1
@entity4 made himself the principal manifestation of that resentment and launched the most successful attack , but the conditions giving rise to that resentment do n't go away just because he 's gone away			0
muslim world had soured on @entity4 " remember : we 're involved in a war in @entity9 , the remnants of a war in @entity176 , a new war in @entity178 ; we continue to conduct @entity179 ( drone ) attacks in @entity66			1
however much we may say that our purposes are looked toward peace , it 's not difficult to understand how people in that part of the world would view us as aggressors			2
and i think that 's what leads to terrorist attacks against the @entity8 and its allies			0
and that does n't change just because @entity4 's gone			0
" he too said the impact of @entity4 's death could affect @entity8 - @entity66 operations			2
if it turns out that the @entity8 carried out the operation without notifying @entity66 officials , " that would seem to suggest that the level of trust between us and @entity66 is pretty close to zero , " he said			0
many questions about what @entity66 knew " given the importance we 've given to collaboration with @entity66 officials and given the resentment of the @entity66 public to @entity8 violations of @entity66 sovereignty , this may really bring things to a head			0
" @entity133 was not persuaded by secretary of state @entity218 's comment monday to reporters that " cooperation with @entity66 helped lead us to @entity4 and the compound in which he was hiding			0
" " we do n't know what the truth is about the level of cooperation or not cooperation , " he said			0
" that kind of statement from @entity218 would seem to suggest that the @entity8 wants to minimize evidence of mistrust , to sustain a pretense of trust rather than to confront what may , in fact , be the reality			0
" the implications of a real rupture in @entity8 - @entity66 relations are frightening , he said			0
" this one seems to be more fraught with mistrust than most any other relation we have			0
and you have to ask how long that can be sustained and whether or not something like this is n't another nail in the coffin			2

in @entity9 , " all the issues that divide the ethnic groups are still there , "
" his legacy is at least hundreds of thousands of dead people , the vast majority of whom were @entity82 "
over the long term , " i think his death is irrelevant , " said @entity135 professor
