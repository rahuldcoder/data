-- the chants started from the upper reaches of @entity3 , but when @entity6 commissioner @entity5 stepped to the podium to begin the @entity6 draft on thursday night , it was clear the fans had more on their minds than the first pick			1
" we want football ! we want football ! we want football ! " those football fans were speaking for millions across the country , all wondering when their sport will get paroled from the labor impasse that has imprisoned it over the past two months			1
@entity21 : @entity6 draft round 2 analysis @entity24 1 aftermath finally , there are signs that might be happening			1
the @entity6 announced thursday , after getting sacked twice in the courts this week , that offseason business resumes today			1
weight rooms are open for workouts again			0
coaches can hand out playbooks			0
read the @entity6 's statement " @entity38 's back , " union chief @entity36 declared			1
the @entity6 and its players still have significant hurdles to clear before reaching an agreement that will finally end the labor dispute that has hovered over the sport for months			1
and , if an appeals court rules in the @entity6 's favor , the league could go right back into shutdown mode			1
but the latest news is potentially a step toward a full , uninterrupted football season			2
here is a quick primer on the latest developments : how did we get to this point ? @entity57 district judge @entity56 issued a strong rebuke of the owners monday , ordering an immediate end to the lockout in an 89 - page ruling			0
the league requested the judge to freeze her ruling , and in a decision that surprised no one , she declined			2
in her ruling , @entity68 wrote that continuing the lockout " is presently inflicting , and will continue to inflict , irreparable harm upon ( the players ) , particularly when weighed against the lack of any real injury that would be imposed on the @entity6 by issuing the preliminary injunction			1
" it was the arguably the biggest victory ever for the @entity6 players , long regarded as the weakest and most often trampled - upon union in professional sports			1
the owners , who want a bigger slice of the league 's $ 9.3 billion revenue pie , had no choice but to resume business			1
" clubs are free to contact players immediately to advise them of the hours that the facility will be open for their use , to schedule medical and rehabilitation activity , and to arrange meetings with coaches or related activity , such as film study or classroom work , " the @entity6 said in its statement			1
how did the @entity6 respond ? bitterly			1
in a letter to @entity97 , @entity5 predicted mass chaos if the players win this fight -- while conveniently ignoring the detail that it was the owners who started it by opting out of their collective bargaining agreement with the players			2
" rather than address the challenge of improving the collective - bargaining agreement for the benefit of the game , " he wrote , " the union - financed lawsuit attacks virtually every aspect of the current system including the draft , the salary cap and free - agency rules , which collectively have been responsible for the quality and popularity of the game for nearly two decades			2
" @entity121 's letter to @entity97 is all that true ? more likely , it 's a stance for negotiating			2
the players are the ones who were comfortable in the current system -- the owners opted out of the current collective bargaining agreement and asked the players to give back $ 1 billion of their slice of the revenue pie to help finance stadium construction			0
so where does the case go now ? to the @entity135 in @entity136			0
the appellate court will rule on the request for a stay , and to prevail , the @entity6 must show that it will be irreparably harmed if a stay is n't granted			1
a ruling on the appeal is expected to take at least two months			0
the onus is now on the owners to prove that the current system harms them -- a hard sell , considering the unprecedented success of professional football and the billion - dollar valuation of the teams			0
the league 's best bet was always to dig in and hope for the players to fracture and cave ; now , with legal rulings on their side , the players have more reason than ever to stay united			1
remember : players make the bulk of their salary during the season			0
most wo n't really notice the financial hit until they start missing checks in september			1
what happens if a stay is n't granted ? get ready for open season			0
the league would need to immediately put in place interim rules governing free agency , rookie signings and trades			0
once it does , the teams would be free to begin signing players , even as the @entity178 process continues			0
the @entity180 's @entity179 reported thursday that all of that could begin as early as monday			1
@entity184 fans are most interested in that : their team is preparing to trade backup quarterback @entity187			0
what does this mean for the newly drafted players ? they 're in the same boat as the current players -- they 'll have to wait and see			0
but unlike the established players , the incoming rookies do n't have the same experience with an @entity6 team			1
the longer the labor issues drag out , the steeper the learning curve might be for the newcomers			0
@entity202 quarterback @entity201 , the no. 1 pick of the @entity204 , has a lot to prove			0
the question is , when will he have the chance to get started ? when should fans really start to fear games will be missed ? if this drags into late august , start worrying			2
the @entity6 left some wiggle room in the schedule , leaving open the possibility that even if no games were played in the first three weeks of the season , all 16 games could still be played			2
the league also reserved hotel rooms for an additional week in @entity219 , the site of the @entity220 , which means the league could move the game from february 5 , 2012 , to february 12 , 2012 , if absolutely necessary			0
what is the best - case scenario for fans ? that the legal rulings -- and the prospect for more litigation and acrimony -- will prompt both sides to get back to the negotiating table and make real concessions			2
that 's always been the most sensible course of action			0
of course , if they did that in the first place , we would n't be in this mess right now .			0

@entity6 fans boo commissioner and chant for football at @entity6 draft
league 's labor battle is being fought in the courts
players have won early legal victories , which may be helping them stay united
a test of their unity could come in september , when they *'d* start missing *paychecks*
