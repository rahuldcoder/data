opinion : looking into the minds of killers the crime that put him on death row @entity3 is talking about the crime that put him on @entity1 's death row , the murder of @entity190			1
on october 8 , 1977 , @entity3 was outside the @entity192 synagogue in @entity193			1
some 200 guests were leaving a bar mitzvah			0
@entity3 had hammered 10 - inch nails into a telephone pole to use as a makeshift gun rest for his hunting rifle			1
as the guests were leaving the synagogue , @entity3 fired , killing @entity190 in front of his wife and three children			1
there would be other victims across the country			0
@entity3 was convicted of killing @entity208 and @entity209 in @entity210 , @entity211 , merely because they were an interracial couple			1
@entity3 confessed to police that college student @entity215 enraged him because she said on spring break , she once dated a @entity218 man			1
in @entity220 , @entity3 had been lying in wait for an interracial couple but 13 - year - old @entity223 and his cousin 14 - year - old @entity224 came walking down the road			1
@entity3 shot them both from his sniper 's nest , striking them twice to make sure the boys were dead			1
@entity231 , who prosecuted the @entity220 case said of @entity3 , " he 's just a creep			1
there 's no other way to describe him			2
and what he did to those two kids because of the color of their skin is incomprehensible			0
" @entity3 also wanted to strike high - profile targets , stalking civil rights leader @entity241 in @entity242 , @entity243 , in 1980 , @entity3 sat outside @entity241 's hotel and waited			1
as @entity241 returned from an event , @entity3 shot him			1
@entity241 was seriously injured but was not killed			2
death row diary offers rare glimpse into a morbid world sickened by @entity249 and out for @entity250 but @entity3 hoped one of his biggest trophy killings would be @entity250 , publisher and founder of @entity249			1
@entity250 's crime according to @entity3 ? " i saw that interracial couple he had , photographed there , having sex , " he says			1
@entity3 is referring to the december 1975 issue of @entity249 that featured several photos of a black man with a white woman			1
" it just made me sick			0
i think whites marry with whites , blacks with blacks , @entity267 with @entity267			0
i threw the magazine down and thought , i 'm gon na kill that guy			0
" on march 6 , 1978 , @entity3 was almost successful			1
@entity250 was in @entity272 , @entity273 , facing charges of obscenity			1
as he returned to the courthouse , two shots struck @entity250			1
@entity250 would barely survive , and he was paralyzed from the waist down			1
in a strange turn , @entity250 has filed a last - minute legal motion with the @entity281 to halt @entity283 's impending execution			1
do not confuse this with mercy , @entity250 explained to me days before i would meet with @entity3			1
" the government has no business at all being in the business of killing people , " he said			2
@entity250 is strongly anti-death penalty , pointing out the inmates on death row are " minorities and underprivileged people , not wealthy white kids			1
" @entity250 believes it 's " much more punishment to put somebody in prison for the rest of their lives than it is to snip their life out in a few seconds with a lethal injection			1
" @entity250 said he never thinks of @entity283 or cares about him , it is merely on principle the publisher is fighting to spare his life			1
when i bring up @entity250 to @entity283 , he breaks into a smile			2
" my old pal @entity314 ! " he exclaims			0
" tell him i appreciate that			0
" he disagrees with @entity250 , though , that the death penalty is less punishment than life in prison			1
after 15 years on death row , freedom ' i 'm willing to accept the will of the lord ' " it 's just not a system that operates according to the @entity326			1
the scriptures tell us when someone repents , @entity329 forgives them			0
everything is forgotten , once forgiven			0
but the state does n't think that way , " he says			0
@entity3 says he 's no longer dangerous nor a racist			1
do you feel any hate looking at me ? i 'm not white			0
" i have no feeling whatsoever , no hatred to you			0
you know what i mean ? " but you shot plenty of women			2
" that 's true , " he nods , " you got a point			2
but i felt they were enemies of the white race			0
" he 's different now , he says , after poring through reams of books in prison			2
he 's " cured his mental illness through education , " he claims			2
do you think something lies out there for you on the other side ? " yeah , but it 's not a burning hell because i 'm serving the @entity323 , though			2
it 'll be the kingdom of heaven for me because i 've repented			0
" i think we 're just about out of time			0
" well let 's not say that			2
let 's just say we 're gon na part temporarily			2
" time is important to you now , is n't it ? " yeah it has been for a long time now			0
maybe we 'll meet again sometime			0
