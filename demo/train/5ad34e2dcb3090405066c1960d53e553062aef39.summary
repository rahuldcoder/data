the cleric , @entity10 , was killed in @entity2 's south - central @entity12 province , @entity0 said			1
the strike would be a further indication that a @entity16 - led drone strike program is continuing following a pause during political upheaval in the majority @entity20 nation			2
the @entity16 has long conducted drone strikes against @entity0 targets under the @entity25 administration			1
but the @entity26 , which tracks the strikes , says there was a nearly two - month pause in the strikes in late 2014 and early 2015 as @entity32 rebels moved against @entity2 's @entity16 - backed government			1
that uprising culminated in the resignation of @entity2 government 's top leaders in mid-january			1

@entity42 responded harshly in a video a week later , saying @entity59 's declaration of an @entity52 caliphate was illegitimate			2
" our brothers in the @entity46 ... surprised us with several steps , including their announcement of the caliphate ( and ) they announced the expansion of the caliphate in a number of countries which they have have no governance , and considered them to be provinces that belonged to them , " @entity10 said , according to a translation by the site intelligence group			0
" the announcement of the caliphate for all @entity79 by our brothers in the @entity46 did not meet the required conditions , " @entity75 argued , because other jihadi groups were not consulted			0
@entity42 also criticized @entity45 for " going too far in interpretations in terms of spilling inviolable blood under the excuse of expanding and spreading the power of the @entity46			0
" @entity45 and @entity0 's top leadership in @entity87 had a bitter falling out in 2014 , and @entity0 and @entity45 fighters have been fighting each other in @entity48 , but @entity0 until november had stayed above the fray , calling for both sides to reconcile and pool resources to strike the @entity16			1

details about how long the journalists allegedly were detained were n't immediately available			0
