@entity0 -- the @entity3 warship @entity4 is scheduled to enter the @entity5 no later than thursday as part of the latest @entity8 military effort to demonstrate support for @entity11 allies concerned about @entity13 's troop buildup along its border with @entity15			1
the movement of the guided missile destroyer was confirmed to @entity1 by two @entity8 military officials who declined to be identified because a formal announcement has not been made			0
the ship will conduct exercises and port visits while in the @entity5			2
the guided missile destroyer @entity24 took part in scheduled exercises in the @entity5 last month and departed march 21			0
@entity28 members @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity31 have @entity5 coastlines , as do non-members @entity15 , @entity13 and @entity34			1
the movement of the @entity3 warship into the @entity5 comes ahead of an april 15 meeting of top @entity28 political representatives to discuss and potentially approve a series of recommendations for additional military measures , including shortening the " response time " of @entity28 forces if there were a crisis			1
other options on the table include more military exercises with member nations including the @entity8 and potentially providing military advisers to @entity15			0
using classified and commercial satellite imagery , the @entity8 estimates there are up to 40,000 @entity13 troops on the border with eastern @entity15			1
those troops remain positioned so close , and are so heavily armed , that the @entity8 and @entity28 calculate they could " roll across " eastern @entity15 in three to five days , one official said			1
that 's an estimate previously made by gen. @entity58 , the military chief of @entity28			0
there has been no withdrawal of @entity13 forces ; other than perhaps small numbers , so the estimate remains in place , the official said			0
@entity0 also believes that the recent unrest in eastern @entity15 around the city of @entity67 is the work of " paid or compelled persons , heavily influenced by @entity13 , " the official said			1
the @entity8 assessment is that the @entity13 are looking for a provocation to move into @entity15			2
but the @entity15 military response of moving in methodically and arresting troublemakers worked in this case , the official said			0
@entity13 warns of civil war if @entity15 uses force to quell eastern revolts @entity8 to send missile defense ships to @entity79 to protect from @entity80			2

the @entity4 will be in the @entity5 by thursday
@entity13 troops are still *massed* on the @entity15 border
@entity28 representatives will meet april 15 to discuss the situation
