-- @entity1 are in a period of amazingly negative thinking about the state of our country			1
a recent @entity8 analysis drove home how deep and how threatening the current mood is			0
@entity8 asked @entity1 in early june how much confidence they had in our nation 's institutions			1
the answer : not much			0
only 30 % had " a great deal " or " quite a lot of confidence " in the @entity19			0
just 29 % felt that way about the presidency			0
and an abysmal 7 % had faith in the @entity23			2
who is the worst president since @entity26 ? think about what this means			0
our most trusted national institution , the unelected @entity19 , has the confidence of almost ( but not quite ) one out of every three @entity1			1
the presidency is slightly weaker and the @entity23 collapses to fewer than 1 in 10 @entity1			2
@entity8 also did some comparative analysis using findings from its @entity35 and the trends regarding @entity1 ' views on government are even more sobering			1
in the poll , 79 % of the @entity1 people believe corruption is widespread in government			1
that is a jump of 20 points since 2006 , when 59 % of the country thought government was corrupt ( a year when the country was dissatisfied enough that the ruling @entity49 lost control of both the @entity51 and @entity52 )			2
the @entity8 analysis demonstrates that @entity1 are more likely to believe their government is corrupt than people in @entity56 , @entity57 or @entity58 , to cite just three examples			1
in january of this year , @entity8 found that more @entity1 picked bad government and corruption as our biggest problem than picked any other challenge , including the economy and unemployment			1
when four out of five @entity1 believe government is corrupt , something is profoundly wrong			1
it is a lot bigger than @entity72 or @entity73 or for that matter @entity75			0
under the weight of this negativity , there has been a dramatic decline in satisfaction with the freedom we have to choose how we live our own lives			0
the number of people saying they are dissatisfied has jumped from 9 % in 2006 to 21 % in 2013			0
this 12 - point jump in dissatisfaction tied the @entity1 for no. 10 among countries suffering the most rapid decline in satisfaction			2
the other countries that have experienced drops of that scale are seriously troubled places , including @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 , and @entity97 ( where youth unemployment is approaching 60 % )			0
to put this in context , the @entity8 numbers show that in 2006 the @entity1 was one of the top countries in the world when it came to satisfaction with freedom			2
by 2013 it had dropped out of the top 25 % of all countries			0
a country in which 4 out of 5 people believe their government is corrupt is a country teetering between a populist uprising and a collapse into cynicism , passivity , and fatalism			1
these results suggest we will either renew our commitment to the rule of law , the punishment of corruption and the insistence on honest self - government or we will cease to be @entity1 as the land of the free and the land of opportunity			1
this @entity126 weekend , we need to remember what our @entity127 did to create the liberty we enjoy and dedicate ourselves to a new burst of freedom and a new wave of political reform that cleans up the corruption and re-establishes the right of every @entity1 to dream and to work to fulfill that dream			2
join us on @entity138 / @entity137 .			0

@entity140 is *concerned* about poll showing @entity1 have little faith in government
@entity145 : if most believe government is corrupt , we are teetering between an uprising and cynicism
without change , he says , we could cease to be the land of the free and of opportunity
