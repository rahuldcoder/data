-- striker @entity1 has been suspended by @entity2 after the furore surrounding his non-appearance from the substitutes ' bench during the 2 - 0 @entity8 defeat at @entity9 on tuesday			1
city manager @entity10 slammed the @entity13 international following his team 's loss at the @entity14 , claiming @entity1 had refused to take to the pitch and would consequently not play for the club again			1
and , although @entity1 subsequently released a statement denying the claims , @entity2 have now confirmed that the player will be suspended for the immediate future			1
a statement on @entity2 's official website read : " @entity2 can confirm that striker @entity1 has been suspended until further notice for a maximum period of two weeks			1
" the player 's suspension is pending a full review into his alleged conduct during tuesday evening 's 2 - 0 defeat to @entity9			1
" the player will not be considered for selection or take part in training whilst the review is under way			0
" earlier on wednesday , former @entity35 forward @entity1 rejected @entity37 coach @entity10 's claims and said the incident was a " misunderstanding			1
" " i would like to apologise to all @entity2 fans , with whom i have always had a strong relationship , for any misunderstanding that occurred in @entity45 , " read the statement from @entity1			1
@entity1 tantrum is a disgrace to soccer " they understand that when i am on the pitch i have always given my best for the club			1
in @entity45 on tuesday i had warmed up and was ready to play			0
this is not the right time to get into specific details as to why this did not happen			0
but i wish to state that i never refused to play			2
" there was some confusion on the bench and i believe my position may have been misunderstood			0
going forward i am ready to play when required and to fulfil my obligations			0
" the statement is in contrast to @entity1 's remarks immediately after the match , when he appeared to reaffirm his desire to leave @entity2			1
" i think it 's @entity10 's decision			2
i 've been a professional throughout , " he told @entity70 broadcaster @entity71 through a translator			0
" i put my opinion through , that i wanted to leave for family reasons and i still played my best			0
" @entity75 double gives @entity9 2 - 0 win the fixture in @entity79 's premier club competition was set to be a landmark occasion for @entity2 ; whose clash with four - time @entity84 champions @entity9 represented their first away match in the tournament			1
but the match unravelled for @entity2 , who won the @entity89 last season , when @entity91 striker @entity75 grabbed two goals in the closing stages of the first half			2
tuesday 's controversy is the latest development in a saga which has seen @entity1 move close to an exit from the @entity99 on several occasions			2
the former @entity102 striker handed in a transfer request in december 2010 , citing a breakdown in communications with the @entity2 board as the reason behind his decision			2
it looked as if @entity1 was set for a return to @entity111 - based @entity102 in july , but the four - time @entity113 champions claimed there was insufficient time to conclude the deal			0
@entity2 have signed a host of attacking players in 2011 , including the capture of @entity120 from @entity121 in january and the additions of @entity123 from @entity124 and @entity126 midfielder @entity125 from @entity127 in the last transfer window			0
as a result , @entity1 has struggled to break into @entity2 's starting line - up so far this season and has seen defender @entity132 replace him as club captain			1
" he wanted to leave last year , " former @entity134 coach @entity10 told a press conference on tuesday			1
" i helped him for two years every time			0
i can not accept this behaviour from him			0
i decide the substitutions , not @entity1			0
" do you think at @entity9 one player can play like this ? or @entity141 or @entity35 ? no. there were 30 minutes to the end			2
there was time to change the game			0

@entity1 earlier issued a statement denying that he had refused to play when asked
