-- as with so many other things in life , exercise may work best if you follow the @entity6 rule : exercise neither too little nor too much , if your goal is to shed extra weight , a new study finds			1
previous research has shown that exercise alone does n't reliably lead to weight loss -- without accompanying restrictions in diet -- a dismaying fact that many hopeful weight - losers know firsthand			1
but a recent @entity20 study suggests that physical activity can indeed help shrink your pants size , so long as you hit the sweet spot -- perhaps somewhere around a half - hour a day , at least for young men			1
for the study , researchers at the @entity26 recruited 61 sedentary and moderately overweight men , mostly in their 20s and early 30s , and randomly assigned them to one of three groups : a control group that remained sedentary with no changes to diet or activity ; another group that took up a 30 - minutes - a - day routine of moderate exercise like jogging or biking ( each participant worked out for either half an hour or until he burned 300 calories ) ; or a third group that exercised more vigorously , for an hour a day or until they burned 600 calories			1
@entity0 : should you drink if you 're training for a race ? before launching into the 13 - week exercise regimen , all the men underwent a baseline checkup to gauge their overall health and fitness : all were overweight but not obese , and they were metabolically healthy			2
during the 13 weeks , the men were instructed not to make any purposeful changes to their eating habits ; they also kept food diaries that the researchers checked later , and on certain days they wore motion sensors to track how much activity they were engaging in outside of their exercise routines			2
by the end of the 13 weeks , the results were both expected and unexpected , the researchers reported			0
not surprisingly , the sedentary group saw no changes in their weight			0
the men in the high - intensity exercise group lost an average of 5 pounds , but while weight loss was expected , the researchers said these men lost about 20 % less than they would have anticipated , given how many extra calories they were burning			1
even more surprising were the results from the moderate exercise group : these men lost an average of 7 pounds each , 83 % more than what the researchers would have guessed based on calorie expenditure alone			0
@entity0 : your @entity80 can help you run faster and harder so , what happened ? it 's not entirely clear from the study , but lead researcher @entity86 had some theories , according to the @entity88			1
first , the intense exercisers were probably compensating for their extra activity by eating more food			0
although the added consumption noted in their food diaries was n't enough to explain their smaller - than - expected weight loss , @entity86 thinks they were likely eating more food than they jotted down			1
in addition , data from the motion sensors showed that the men who exercised the most were sedentary when they were n't working out ; they spent most of their free time sitting , probably because they were tired , @entity86 said			0
in contrast , the men who exercised for 30 minutes at at time became more active throughout the day , probably opting to take the stairs instead of the elevator , for instance , and moving more in general , @entity86 said			0
" it was little things , but they add up , " @entity86 told the @entity88			0
overall , @entity86 concluded , people who exercise less may end up burning just enough calories to lose weight , but not enough to feel compelled to replace them , either by eating more or remaining sedentary otherwise			2
those who exercise a lot , on the other hand , may feel more drained , which prompts them to compensate			2
@entity0 : 5 common mistakes you 're making at the gym the findings are intriguing , but it 's hard to say how generalizable they are to groups other than young , healthy men			0
it 's also not known how exercise may impact weight loss over the long term			1
the @entity88 reports : " the study also was short - term , and the results might shift over the course of , say , a year of continued exercise , mr. @entity86 says			2
the men working out for 60 minutes were , after all , packing on some muscle , while the 30 - minute exercisers were not			0
" that extra muscle offset some of the vigorous exercisers ' weight loss in the short term -- they sloughed off fat but added muscle , decreasing their net loss -- but over the longer term it could amp up their metabolism , aiding in weight control			1
" you can read more about the study , published in the @entity159 -- regulatory , integrative and @entity162 , in the @entity88 article here			0
@entity0 : sports products may not enhance your workout this story was originally published on @entity0			0
for more weight loss , exercise less ?			1

exercise is n't enough to lead to weight loss , research has shown
a new @entity20 study shows that a half - hour of exercise may be the ideal
researcher suggests those who intensely exercise may compensate by overeating
