-- former vice presidential candidate @entity1 joined the national battle over @entity4 's controversial new immigration law saturday , appearing with gov. @entity5 in @entity6 to denounce the @entity9 administration 's criticism of the law			1
" it 's time for @entity13 across this great country to stand up and say ' we 're all @entity15 now and , in clear unity , we say mr. president , do your job , secure our border , ' " @entity1 said , standing beside @entity5 at a saturday afternoon press conference			1
@entity5 used the event to announce her first appointment to the state 's new @entity24 and the launch of a website to combat what she said was a national misinformation campaign about the state 's new law			2
@entity1 and @entity5 , both republicans , decried plans by opponents of the new law to boycott the state in protest			1
passed in april , the law requires immigrants in @entity4 to carry their registration documents at all times and allows police to question individuals ' immigration status in the process of enforcing any other law or ordinance			2
critics say it will lead to racial profiling , while supporters deny that and say it is needed to crack down on increasing crime involving illegal immigrants			1
president @entity9 has criticized the @entity4 law , saying that in dealing with the immigration issue , " the answer is n't to undermine fundamental principles that define us as a nation			2
" " you can imagine if you are an @entity66 in @entity4 , your great grandparents may have been there before @entity4 was even a state , but now suddenly if you do n't have your papers , and you took your kid out to get ice cream , you 're gon na be harassed , " @entity9 said , referring to the statute at a april rally in @entity64			0
" that 's something that could potentially happen , " he said			0
" that 's not the right way to go			0
" @entity5 signed a package of changes to the law shortly after it passed that she said addressed concerns about profiling , though critics said the changes made little difference			1
@entity1 joined @entity5 on saturday in denying the statute would lead to racial profiling			1
" i think for most @entity13 people the reaction to that would be , ' why are n't ( police ) already doing that ? ' " the former @entity86 governor said			0
" and while @entity93 's president has begun to crack down on the violent drug cartels and corruption in his own country , " she continued , " it 's time for the @entity13 government to enforce the rule of law as well			0
" @entity5 also took jabs at @entity9 and the federal government			0
" our border is being erased and our president apparently considers it a wonderful opportunity to divide people along racial lines for his personal political convenience , " she said .			0
