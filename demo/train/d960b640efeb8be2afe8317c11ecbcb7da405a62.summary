at the edge of the @entity3 war , photographer @entity0 found despair packed in tent camps and an outpouring of humanity from a tight - knit @entity10 border community			1
" there were too many people			2
every day new tent areas sprung up and even that was not enough			2
people slept in mosques , abandoned homes , schools , any building they can find , and if they could n't find anything , they slept in the street , " @entity0 recalls			1
the more than three - year @entity3 civil war gave ethnic @entity23 an opportunity to break away from the central government and operate in semi-autonomous enclaves in the country 's north , but it also meant that when the radical group @entity30 threatened to overrun the strategic town of @entity32 , the minority stood on its own			2
the fury and spectacle of the battle on the @entity10 border drew the attention of the world and brought @entity0 with a sleeping bag , a @entity41 camera and some spare change to nearby refugee camps , where he immersed himself for 17 days			1
" i could not just come during the day and sleep in a hotel at night because i wanted to feel what they feel and truly understand the situation , " @entity0 says , " i found myself sleeping , eating , sharing cigarettes and daily life with the refugees			1
when other photographers would come they would hide their faces because they knew the difference			0
they felt i was more sincere and trusted me			0
" in just four days , 200,000 people from @entity32 and the surrounding areas fled the horror of a terror group infamous for mass execution , beheadings and crucifixion			2
the exodus brought mothers cradling babies sucking on pacifiers and fathers bowing under the weight of belongings wrapped in bed sheets to @entity10 's already strained border			1
the international media , generally barred from access by the restrictions of president @entity77 's government , captured every frame			0
television crews perched on @entity23 hilltops broadcast live skirmishes between @entity23 forces and masked @entity30 militants just a few hundred kilometers away from the border			2
" i used my camera as an instrument to hold my distance from the reality of what was happening , so i would n't feel 100 % in the situation , " @entity0 says			1
" there was constant distraction and demolishment			0
even the best things that happened destroyed homes and people			0
" the " best things " were @entity98 - led coalition airstrikes that successfully reversed @entity30 ' advance on the town and deterred the expansion of the group 's so - called @entity103 caliphate , which stretches from north - central @entity3 to @entity106 's @entity105			0
as @entity10 's @entity23 community buried more of its soldiers and struggled to feed thousands of homeless families , the smoke and flash of @entity98 warplanes bombing jihadis proved an outlet for the ethnic group 's seething anger			1
" when you are really close to the war but you are still somewhat safe in your own country , and you see bombs dropping down and people dying and other people applauding this , you can tell this is war tourism			0
" @entity0 says of the @entity23 gathered to cheer the aerial campaign			1

the fight for @entity32 is just one chapter in a war the @entity135 calls " the biggest humanitarian emergency of our era , " but the episode features all the facets of the savage conflict that has claimed the lives of more than a 190,000 people and left an entire generation hollow			0
" i am not doing this for fame or money or any earthly reason			0
first i need to satisfy my own sense of being as human and my connectedness to all humanity , " @entity0 says , " second i want to provoke a sense of curiosity in people , so they may act on it			1
" @entity0 is a @entity10 photographer based in @entity158			1
you can follow him on @entity160 .			0
