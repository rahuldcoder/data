-- the people who killed three @entity3 teenagers have hurt the @entity3 people deeply , there 's no doubt about that			1
but they have also harmed @entity8 , and they have hurt the cause of peace			1
anyone who fails to condemn this horrific act -- the murder of students going home from school -- is contributing to the poison that makes peace so difficult in the @entity19			1
anyone who hesitates , who equivocates , is helping to prolong the conflict			2
for @entity8 and their supporters around the world , if you remain silent about the killing of @entity3 , you are adding to the duration and bitterness of this conflict			1
excuse this atrocity , and you condemn the people of this area to remain enemies for the foreseeable future			0
that does not mean you can not criticize @entity3 actions , but the cold - blooded murder of @entity3 children will have the effect of making @entity3 less willing to believe they can accept @entity8 as their neighbors and live in peace			1
@entity3 today are consumed with grief , but they are watching how the world reacts			1
they are watching how @entity8 react			1
i , for one , am convinced that the vast majority of @entity3 would strongly support , even advocate and push for a withdrawal from the @entity51 if they really believed that they would be safe living alongside a @entity8 state			1
these attacks undermine their confidence			0
they provide evidence to back the claim that @entity8 will never let that happen , that what they really want is to destroy @entity3			1
in the hours after we learned that bodies of the three teens -- @entity67 , 19 , @entity68 , 16 and @entity69 , 16 -- had been found under a pile of rocks in a field near @entity73 , reaction has been predictable and often disheartening , just as it was when we found out someone had kidnapped them on june 12			2
@entity69 , it 's worth noting , was an @entity78 citizen , which brings up the question of how the @entity78 will respond to his killing			2
secretary of state @entity82 said earlier that " many indications point to @entity85 involvement , " noting that @entity85 , designated as a terrorist organization by many countries , has used kidnappings in the past			0
the @entity90 says it has launched an investigation			0
the atrocities were swiftly condemned by some countries			0
on social media , there has been a flurry of accusations against @entity3 ahead of what is expected to be a strong @entity3 reaction against @entity85 , which prime minister @entity100 says he is absolutely sure carried out the operation			1
but others were slow to comment			0
it took the @entity105 's foreign policy chief almost a week to condemn the kidnappings			0
she did it only after @entity3 complained about @entity109 silence			1
days earlier , @entity3 forces rushed into the @entity51 in an urgent and ultimately unsuccessful effort to find the three before they were killed			1
the military deployment produced clashes with protesters in which five @entity8 were killed by @entity3 soldiers			1
that received a great deal of attention			0
the mothers of the kidnapped students appealed for help at the @entity123 in @entity124 , describing " every mother 's nightmare ... waiting and waiting endlessly for her child to come home			2
" they described their children , one was an amateur pastry chef			0
another " loves to play guitar and basketball			0
he 's a good student and a good boy , " said a heartbroken @entity133 of her son @entity134			0
but the @entity123 reacted to her tearful words with chilling indifference			0
many others , including human rights organizations , tempered their criticism of the kidnapping by calling the boys " settlers			0
" the truth is that two of the three did not live on the @entity51			0
they lived west of the @entity149 well inside @entity3			1
the third lived in a settlement called @entity152 , in the @entity154 area , which was in @entity156 hands before the 1967 war , even before the 1948 war , and even @entity159 , a harsh critic of @entity3 settlement , agrees it will remain in @entity3 after a @entity8 state is created			1
every peace plan has agreed			2
but that 's hardly relevant			0
the teens were students , not warriors			2
for some @entity8 , the kidnapping was cause for celebration			2
a new three - finger salute became popular , marking the capture of three @entity3			2
the @entity174 page for @entity175 , the @entity176 's main party , had a number of cartoons , including one showing the three teenagers as @entity156 rats , wearing yarmulkes , caught on a fishing line			0
to his great credit , @entity176 president @entity183 condemned the kidnapping			0
for that , he came under fierce criticism			0
@entity85 , which is now part of the @entity176 government in a unity deal with @entity175 , made no effort to conceal its glee			0
@entity85 denies it had anything to do with the kidnapping			0
but earlier , its exiled chief , @entity195 , was ambiguous about responsibility , saying only " i congratulate the abductors			0
" opinion : slain teens call for justice , not escalation when @entity3 authorities named two @entity85 members as the perpetrators , the mother of one of the men told @entity3 television " if he did it , i 'll be proud of him			2
" she joins other @entity8 mothers proud of children who commit murder , adding to @entity3 ' doubts about future coexistence			1
@entity3 are watching closely to see what @entity183 does about his unity deal with @entity85 , an organization that is openly committed to @entity3 's destruction			1
if @entity3 can show definitive proof that @entity85 was indeed behind the kidnapping and killing , it is inconceivable that @entity183 would let the unity deal stand			1
it is even more inconceivable that the @entity78 and @entity109 would continue providing millions to support the @entity176 under those conditions			0
this killing hurts @entity3 and @entity8 who want peace			1
the only way this tragedy could be turned into a positive step would be if the @entity8 who support reconciliation , who are outraged by what happened , would speak out loudly against it			1
that would spark a positive reaction and create energy toward reconciliation			1
can that happen ? in this atmosphere , we can only hope for a positive surprise .			2

@entity241 : the killing of three @entity3 students hurts @entity19 peace process
@entity246 : @entity3 are consumed with grief , but they are watching how the world reacts
she says @entity8 who are outraged should speak out loudly against the tragedy
@entity246 : that would spark a positive reaction and create energy toward reconciliation
