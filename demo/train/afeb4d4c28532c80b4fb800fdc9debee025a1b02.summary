-- a massive political fight over defense spending is about to take place			1
if @entity5 does not take action by march 1 , there will be $ 1.2 billion in across - the - board spending cuts that @entity5 and president @entity8 had agreed to as part of the debt ceiling agreement of 2011			2
like with many other issues , @entity11 are trying to figure out what their position should be in the post- 2012 election world			1
with two consecutive losses in presidential elections and approval ratings in the tank , the party leadership is trying to figure out how to broaden rather than contract their electoral coalition			2
the best evidence of this came with the bipartisan agreement on immigration reform announced last week			0
@entity11 face the same important challenge when it comes to defense			1
during the presidential campaign , @entity30 embraced a predictable response by warning that cuts would devastate the military and endanger @entity36 security			2
he often drew on secretary of defense @entity38 's warnings to make his case			2
other republicans have joined the chorus of politicians who want to paint the @entity44 administration as weak on defense			1
writing for @entity0 , @entity46 , who worked in president @entity49 's administration , warned that the defense cuts would be the " most dramatic and dangerous " in history			0
likewise , @entity55 @entity54 sen. @entity54 remarked : " how do you go to somebody in the military who 's been deployed four or five times ... and say , ' for your good work over the last decade , we 're going to ruin the military			0
... " this approach to the defense cuts , insisting that they should not happen and that high levels of spending are essential to the safety of the nation , fits into the recent history of the @entity11			1
over the past four decades , @entity11 became increasingly hawkish on national security			1
skeptics of military intervention , such as sen. @entity70 , were pushed aside as mavericks and neoconservative rhetoric became the staple for the party			0
when it came to defense , big government was good and any questions about military spending were in fact challenges to our security			1
republicans might consider tapping into a different tradition , one that grows out of their own party history , in the coming months if they want to take a more nuanced approach			0
for many decades , the @entity11 was skeptical about the expansion of military spending and national security programs			1
this was not about being isolationist			0
during the @entity94 period , there were important voices in the party that believed the excessive growth of government on defense posed the same kinds of risks as did domestic spending growth			1
@entity104 sen. @entity103 , " mr. @entity54 , " who was the leader of the party in the upper chamber , was a well - known critic of the @entity108 buildup			0
while believing that the @entity36 needed to be able to respond to the @entity110 threat , he feared that excessive military spending would lead to the creation of a " @entity113 " that trampled on the very liberties that @entity36 were trying to protect			1
@entity11 president @entity115 , a military hero who was instrumental in the @entity117 victory , also did n't have much tolerance for endless defense spending			1
he spent much of his second term fighting against hawkish @entity44 to hold down the military budget			2
@entity115 , who believed as much as anyone that the @entity36 had to be tough in the fight against communists , thought that too much of defense spending was driven by partisan interests and military contractors , having little to do with what the nation actually needed			1
like @entity103 , he feared that the huge appetite of @entity5 for rising spending was going to destroy the liberties and limited government that was at the center of what the @entity36 was trying to protect			0
he also thought the expanding deficit would ultimately crush the @entity36 economy			0
his famous farewell address about the " military - industrial complex " sent a strong warning to those who ignored this issue			0
but those voices were drowned out by the hawks			0
republicans , especially after the @entity145 , adopted a very different posture where the drive for higher defense spending became a core issue , as much as tax cuts			1
now that defense cuts are on the table , a better partisan debate would be over where to cut defense spending and how to make our dollars give us the best security bang for the buck			1
this would entail a serious look at spending that has been driven too often by the needs of legislators to satisfy contractors in their district rather than decisions about what kinds of weapons are most effective			0
despite all the dramatic rhetoric , the fact is that the @entity36 spent more in 2011 ( $ 711 billion ) than did @entity172 , @entity173 , the @entity174 , @entity175 , @entity176 , @entity177 , @entity178 , @entity179 , @entity180 , @entity181 , @entity182 , @entity183 and @entity184 combined ( $ 695 billion )			0
even with the sequestration , according to @entity186 , @entity36 spending would only decline from being 40 % of all military spending around the globe to 38 %			1
as @entity192 , former assistant secretary of defense under @entity193 wrote in @entity194 , " the defense budget should and can be reduced significantly without harming national security			0
" @entity192 pointed out that the cuts would only amount to 15 % a year , which would still have the @entity36 spending much more on defense on average than the country did in the @entity108			2
right now , republicans are not well positioned for this debate			0
ironically , president @entity8 is -- given that during his first term he broke with his party with an aggressive stance toward terrorism , including the killing of @entity206 , and potentially with picking a @entity11 secretary of defense			1
he is well positioned to push for defense cuts without opening himself up to charges of being a reckless dove			0
@entity11 need to show the nation that they can engage in serious debates over the policy needs of the nation , rather than simply reiterating talking points meant to please the base			2
if they do n't , on this issue , like so many others , the party will stand far off center and make it that much harder for the next presidential candidate to build a winning coalition			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity226 .			2

@entity226 : a massive political fight over defense spending is about to take place
@entity226 : republicans are trying to figure out what their position should be after election loss
he says in decades past , the @entity11 was not an *advocate* for expansion of military spending
@entity226 : republicans must have real *discussions* and not go along with the hawkish voices
