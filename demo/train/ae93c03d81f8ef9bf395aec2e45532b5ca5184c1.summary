hundreds of children across the @entity1 have been hospitalized with a serious respiratory illness			2
scientists say they believe the bug to blame is @entity5 , also known as @entity6			2
list of states with the @entity9 enteroviruses are common , especially in september , but this particular type is not			1
there have been fewer than 100 cases recorded since it was identified in the 1960s , according to the @entity16			2
here 's what you need to know as a parent : what are the symptoms ? the virus usually starts like the common cold ; symptoms include sneezing , a runny nose and a cough			1
this is all that happens for most people who catch an enterovirus			0
but some patients will get a severe cough , have difficulty breathing and / or develop a rash			1
@entity37 - @entity36 is sometimes also accompanied by a fever or wheezing			1
so when should you begin worrying ? unfortunately in the beginning it 's difficult -- if not impossible -- to tell the difference between a regular cold and this type of virus			1
but there are symptoms you should be on the lookout for if your child becomes sick			1
go to the doctor if he or she develops a fever or a rash , or if your child has difficulty breathing			1
children with asthma or a history of breathing problems are particularly susceptible for severe symptoms			1
how is @entity6 treated ? there is no specific treatment for enteroviruses , according to the @entity16			0
plenty of rest , fluids and over-the - counter medications will help ease symptoms in standard cases			1
patients who are hospitalized will likely receive assistance breathing and what 's called " supportive therapy " to help their immune systems fight off the infection			2
where is the virus spreading ? twelve states are investigating clusters of enterovirus illnesses : @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity90 and @entity91			0
but @entity6 is often hard to distinguish from its relatives so the virus could be in other states as well			0
@entity9 difficult to track why are kids being hospitalized ? anyone can get infected with enteroviruses , according to the @entity16 , but infants , children and teens are more likely to become sick because they have not yet built up immunity from previous exposures to the viruses			0
how do i protect my children ? the respiratory illness spreads through close contact , just like the common cold			1
you can also be infected by touching objects or surfaces that have the virus on them , then touching your face			0
there 's not a great deal you can do , health officials say , beyond taking common - sense steps to reduce the risk			2
wash your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds -- particularly after going to the bathroom and changing diapers			0
clean and disinfect surfaces that are regularly touched by different people , such as toys and doorknobs			0
avoid shaking hands , kissing , hugging and sharing cups or eating utensils with people who are sick			0
and stay home if you feel unwell .			0
