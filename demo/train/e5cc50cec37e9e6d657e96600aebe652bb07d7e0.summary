@entity0 -- is bipartisanship in @entity0 really dead ? not for a pair of junior senators from different parties who flew to the other side of the world to see whether they could experience across - the - aisle cooperation by living for a week on a deserted island with almost no provisions			1
sen. @entity13 , @entity14 , and sen. @entity15 , @entity16 , came back to the @entity17 from their survivalist adventure in the @entity20 last month -- which was shot for an upcoming @entity22 special -- poking fun at each other like best friends and finishing each others ' sentences like brothers			1
" all of a sudden he thought he was part of the @entity30 , " @entity13 joshed			1
" " 20 hour limit to the day , " @entity15 deadpanned			1
they stood for an impromptu session with a small group of reporters thursday , after stepping off the @entity38 floor where they had voted , perhaps not surprisingly , opposite one another on a campaign finance bill			0
they said the idea for the trip was sparked a year ago during a late - night series of floor votes where they compared past trips each had taken to spear fish			0
" @entity13 had his @entity50 and showed me some pictures of the last trip he did with his kids			1
then i started to show him pictures of fish i had speared on various trips , " said @entity15			2
" he speared bigger fish than i had , " @entity13 said			2
" so i thought ... " " hey , there might be some value here , " @entity15 interjected , completing @entity13 's thought			1
@entity13 knew what he needed because he has some previous survivalist experience			1
a year ago , he and his sons spent a week on a similar deserted island			1
@entity22 allowed them to take only three provisions on the sandy atoll but the senators refused to say what they were -- " tune in , " they responded in unison			2
" that was a nonstarter , " @entity13 said			2
" we were afraid but not naked			0
" asked what skill the other person had for which they were grateful , @entity13 said , " i 'm glad @entity15 's the engineer type			1
because i would n't have known how to put together a shelter			0
" " he opens coconuts with a machete faster than anyone i 've ever seen , " @entity15 responded			2
" that came in handy because that 's all we had to drink for a long time , " @entity13 replied			2
they were asked whether they think the trip will open doors for them to work together in the future , and they seemed upbeat			0
" i think what 's missing most around here is trust , and that 's mostly because people do n't know each other very well , " @entity15 said			0
" i think you need to know each other before you can figure out where you can work together			0
" @entity13 said they considered bringing their own @entity107 cameras and documenting the trips themselves but then thought @entity22 might do a better job			1
@entity22 " convinced us that if this is to have some value in terms of promoting bipartisanship and trust , it 's better for people to see and hear the dialogue between us , " he explained			0
asked whether there were any tensions between the men , @entity15 acknowledged " it was pretty stressful			0
" " this was not a resort experience , " he said			0
" it was competitive , " @entity13 said .			0
