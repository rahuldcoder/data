-- in a historic fine , @entity1 will pay out a record $ 1.92 billion to @entity4 authorities to settle money laundering accusations -- activities which have allegedly occurred with drug cartels in @entity8 and terror - linked groups in @entity10			1
@entity4 authorities declared @entity1 , the @entity11 's biggest bank by market capitalization , in breach of a series of @entity4 laws , including the @entity16			1
" we accept responsibility for our past mistakes			1
we have said we are profoundly sorry for them , and we do so again			0
the @entity1 of today is a fundamentally different organization from the one that made those mistakes , " @entity1 ceo @entity21 , said in a statement			1
on monday , @entity25 , the @entity11 's second largest bank by market value , agreed to pay $ 327 million to settle @entity28 charges of violating sanctions on transactions with @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity34 between 2001 and 2007			1
in august @entity25 paid $ 340 million to the state of @entity37 's @entity36 to settle civil charges alleging it had concealed $ 250 billion in illegal transactions with @entity31			1
but while this week 's fines are record fees , they are not earth - shattering when compared to the billions of dollars the banks boast in market values , assets and profits			1
according to @entity49 , it will take @entity1 a mere 41 days to earn back the $ 1.9 billion fine			1
" these banks are big and you can argue that these kinds of settlements have some mitigating effect on risk - taking , " says @entity51 , professor of accounting at the @entity52			0
but " @entity1 has about a $ 123 billion market cap today so its ( $ 1.9 billion ) fine is about 1 %			1
this is not a huge amount			0
the stock price will vary that much in any given day anyway			0
" indeed , @entity1 's share price appears to have not suffered in light of these charges			1
in @entity68 trading , @entity1 rose 0.31 % by mid-day tuesday			1
since news of @entity1 's allegations hit in @entity73 , @entity1 's share price in @entity68 has risen 16.3 %			2
in the same time period in @entity77 trading , its share price has risen nearly 15 %			0
since the start of 2009 , there have been at least 21 instances where global banks and financial institutions have been fined -- predominantly by @entity4 authorities			1
cases include a $ 536 million fine against @entity86 in december 2009 for allowing clients in @entity31 , @entity33 and @entity88 to conduct financial transactions ; a $ 335 million fine against @entity90 on racial discrimination charges in lending rates ; and a $ 619 million fine against @entity94 that involved a cover - up of fund transfers that violated @entity4 sanctions against @entity88 and @entity31			1
@entity51 says bank improprieties will continue as long as governments continue to back them -- fallout from the 2008 financial crisis when the @entity4 labeled some banks : " too big to fail			1
" " the obvious natural consequence of governments bailing out banks , or any industry for that matter , " says @entity51 , " is that executives are able to take on more risk ( and ) governments bailing out banks puts us all at risk			0
