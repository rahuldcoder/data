-- the sun was barely up when @entity3 mayor @entity2 used the @entity5 massacre to scold president @entity6 and @entity7 for ignoring the gun issue			1
" this is a real problem			0
no matter where you stand on the @entity13 , no matter where you stand on guns , we have a right to hear from both of them concretely , " @entity2 argued			0
@entity2 challenges @entity6 , @entity7 to take action on guns he has a point -- gun policy is a back burner debate these days , largely because @entity23 who had pushed for tighter gun laws concluded it 's bad politics			1
after the 1999 @entity29 shooting , @entity23 vice president @entity27 played a central role in trying to pass ill - fated gun control legislation			1
on the campaign trail during his 2000 presidential run , he argued for " common - sense gun safety measures			0
" @entity23 strategists said they believe @entity27 and other @entity23 lost critical votes in rural @entity37 by pushing for stricter gun laws			2
so , @entity23 leaders began to recruit candidates who could win those largely red districts and states , candidates who ran on support for gun rights			1
@entity46 worked in the @entity47 for more than 20 years as a top aide to @entity49 sen. @entity49 and @entity47 majority leader @entity50			1
he witnessed the change up close			0
" democrats finally figured out that this was an issue that they were getting walloped on in many @entity57 , @entity56 states and many swing states , " @entity46 said			0
" so they began a subtle shift to try to coordinate and / or get more pro-gun @entity23 to run			0
" " for many @entity23 , it 's smart politics not to get into the gun control debate , " he said			1
@entity6 on shooting : this is n't a day for politics so , even though president @entity68 signed an assault weapons ban in 1994 with fanfare , it lapsed in 2004 without much of a fight			1
even after major tragedies shoved the gun issue into the headlines , there was some talk , but little action			0
@entity7 calls for unity after @entity5 shooting the 2007 @entity81 massacre resulted in a minor change : beefing up background checks for the mentally ill. last year 's assassination attempt of then - rep. @entity85 , @entity86 , produced only a few calls to make high - capacity magazines like those used in that shooting illegal			1
" there is no earthly reason for these weapons to have that kind of bullet capacity , " argued sen. @entity91 , @entity92 , one of the few remaining anti-gun stalwarts			0
but @entity47 @entity23 would n't hold a vote , and @entity85 ' @entity101 colleagues in the @entity102 said at the time new laws were useless			1
" bad guys are going to get guns , they 're going to get clips and they 're going to do bad things , " rep. @entity105 , @entity106 , said then			0
in fact , the @entity23 - led @entity47 has n't voted on any gun legislation in three years , since defeating a @entity101 measure that would have required states to recognize each others ' gun laws			1
why ? many still point to the @entity118 spokesman : @entity118 tweeter was ' unaware ' of @entity5 shooting " the @entity118 is an extremely powerful organization and they deliver votes and they deliver money , " said @entity46 , who now works for @entity122 , a public affairs group in @entity124			0
in the wake of the @entity5 movie massacre , the @entity118 issued a statement steering clear of gun politics			2
" our thoughts and prayers are with the victims , their families and the community			0
@entity118 will not have any further comment until all the facts are known , " said @entity136 , the @entity118 's director of public affairs			2
because gun issues are not at the forefront of the political debate , the @entity118 's clout is n't talked about as much as it was in the 1980s and 1990s , when gun policy was a hot topic			1
but the @entity118 is still active and not afraid to throw its weight around on topics that even tangentially involve gun policy			2
for example , earlier this summer the @entity118 warned vulnerable @entity102 members that it was watching their vote on whether to hold attorney general @entity154 in contempt over the failed " @entity157 " gun - walking operation			1
@entity118 executive director @entity158 has said his group supported the contempt vote because of the @entity167 's " obstruction of congressional oversight of a program that costs lives in support of an anti-gun agenda			2
" at the end of the day , of those seeking re-election who voted in favor of contempt , more than half are listed in competitive districts by the @entity176 and rely on conservative support -- including endorsements and cash from the @entity118 -- to survive their tough political battles			2
the @entity118 has reported more and more contributions to @entity23 in recent elections -- from $ 236,330 in 2008 to $ 373,500 in 2010 --- still far less than the $ 911,250 the organization gave to @entity101 that year			2
when it comes to presidential politics , the @entity118 and the @entity6 campaign both know full well that he could win or lose re-election in battlegrounds like @entity190 and @entity191 , where the @entity118 has significant sway over some swing voters			1
that 's why the president is trying to heed the lesson of @entity27 and not go there when it comes to gun control			0
that has n't kept the @entity118 from mobilizing members against him			0
" when we 're done speaking out , sir , gun owners will have made the difference in key precincts in battleground states , " @entity118 executive vice president @entity203 told the organization 's meeting in april			1
" you 'll have us to blame for your defeat in november , " he said , rallying the crowd			0
@entity0 's @entity213 contributed to this report .			0
