-- vacation rental site @entity1 apologized monday in the wake of recent highly publicized rental horror stories and announced new property protections and safety measures for site users			1
@entity8 , ceo and co-founder of the site , called the days since reports of theft and damage to one host 's @entity15 home surfaced " a crash course in crisis management " in a blog post on @entity1			1
" we felt paralyzed and over the last four weeks , we have really screwed things up , " @entity8 wrote			2
last month , a @entity15 blogger identifying herself only as " @entity23 " wrote that her apartment had been ransacked by a person who rented her home via @entity1			1
police have made an arrest related to the case , the @entity27 reported			0
the newspaper described @entity23 as a corporate event planner in her late 30s who asked not to be named because she still feels victimized			0
" we let her down , and for that we are very sorry , " @entity8 wrote of @entity23 's experience in his blog post			1
@entity8 also announced a $ 50,000 @entity38 to protect hosts ' property			2
@entity23 will be eligible for the program , going into effect august 15			0
the suspect allegedly took @entity23 's passport , cash , credit card and her grandmother 's jewelry hidden inside a closet , @entity23 wrote in her blog post			2
also reportedly missing : her camera , @entity52 , laptop , and an external backup drive filled with photos and journals			0
@entity23 is also worried about identity theft because she suspects her birth certificate and social security card were photocopied			2
" i do believe that maybe 97 % of @entity61 's users are good and honest people			1
unfortunately i got the other 3 %			0
someone was bound to eventually , i suppose , and there will be others , " @entity23 wrote			0
in addition to the property guarantee , @entity1 has doubled its customer support team to 88 employees since last month and has designated a team to review suspicious activity			1
a 24 - hour customer support line will be available starting next week , according to @entity1			1
hosts now will be able to select " @entity77 " for bookings and new profiles will provide more user history online			0
@entity8 outlined some safety improvements last week in a guest column on the blog @entity81 , but over the weekend , another @entity1 user came forward with an alleged rental horror story			1
@entity84 told @entity81 that a meth addict with a stolen identity rented his @entity87 , @entity88 , home two months ago and did thousands of dollars worth of damage			0
" at the end of the day , you are renting to a stranger			0
you should check ... @entity93 's and phone numbers to make sure they match , " @entity84 told @entity81			2
still , he said he reached an " agreeable solution " with @entity1 and has since both rented his place out again and stayed in others ' homes through the service			1
in a " @entity105 " section on its website , the company advises both parties to look for a user 's complete profile on the site and check how others have rated the person			2
meanwhile , the incident involving @entity23 , the @entity15 blogger , took another twist late last week when she wrote that one of the co-founders of @entity1 asked her to shut down her blog or limit its access because of the " potentially negative impact it could have on his company 's growth and current round of funding			1
" @entity1 has not responded to requests for comment about the blogger 's claims			1
@entity1 was founded in 2008 with a simple concept : connect people who have space to rent -- anything from an extra bedroom to a whole house -- with those who are looking for a place to stay			1
the company gets money from both parties : hosts are charged a 3 % fee when they receive a successful booking , while travelers pay an additional 6 - 12 % on top of the rental fee			0
users have booked more than 2 million nights in 190 countries through the service , the company says on its website			0
the startup is so hot that it has attracted actor @entity154 as one of its investors			0
even before the reported horror stories , consumer advisers urged potential users to be sure they understood the process and proceeded with caution			0
@entity164 money expert @entity163 has said @entity1 is not for everybody , calling it an option for " extra-thrifty " and adventurous travelers			1
@entity170 , a reporter for @entity171 , recently tested the service and had a mixed experience			0
for less money than it would cost to stay in a hostel , she rented a charming flat in @entity177			2
but she encountered a strange host and a flooded kitchen when she rented a loft in @entity181			0
still , @entity170 said she would definitely book through @entity1 again			1
@entity0 's @entity182 contributed to this report			2

@entity1 connects people who have space to rent with those looking for a place to stay

@entity1 announces property protection guarantee , other security measures
