-- there 's no evidence the heated political environment played any role in the shooting spree that left rep. @entity6 in critical condition and killed six others , but observers say if nothing else , the tragedy will force politicians to re-evaluate their rhetoric			1
militant - themed messages and speeches laced with fear have marked recent dialogue in @entity18 and on the campaign trail , but in the aftermath of the massacre in @entity25 , lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are calling on their colleagues to tone it down			1
" an event like this really ought to make us rethink the way we speak to each other every day about politics and policy in the country , especially in the @entity39 , " said @entity28 , professor of rhetoric at @entity30			1
the night before saturday 's shooting in @entity41 , @entity25 , @entity6 issued a new call for more civility in politics			1
she sent an e-mail to outgoing @entity47 secretary of state @entity46 , a @entity48 , that included a remark about the need to " tone our rhetoric and partisanship down			1
" @entity6 e-mail : need to ' tone our rhetoric and partisanship down ' the suspected shooter 's motive is unclear , but @entity59 , @entity25 , sheriff @entity60 was quick to criticize the " vitriolic rhetoric " heard on the radio and television			1
" that may be free speech , but it 's not without consequences , " he said saturday			0
former @entity70 gov. @entity69 's political aide removed a controversial web post this weekend that featured cross hairs over the congressional districts of 20 @entity75 candidates , including @entity6			2
a @entity69 aide denied the @entity77 posting from the 2010 congressional campaign was designed to incite violence			2
adviser : linking @entity69 to shootings ' appalling ' @entity83 conservative radio host @entity82 took heat after remarking at a @entity86 rally , " if ballots do n't work , bullets will			0
" biting language has also come from those on the left , with @entity75 and president @entity92 pegging @entity48 as " hostage takers			0
" despite all the nastiness , @entity94 , professor of political communication at @entity96 in @entity97 , said the notion that the rhetoric caused the violence is " fallacious			1
" that connection , he said , is born out of recognition that such violent incidents ca n't be eradicated			0
" the motive i think is the frustration that a congresswoman can be shot and that a judge can be killed and that an utterly innocent little girl can be killed and we ca n't preventatively stop these matters			0
the frustration is that we can not stop this , " @entity94 said			0
poll : charged speech not to blame for @entity25 attacks @entity119 , a senior political analyst for @entity0 , said that until the gunman 's motive is clear , pointing fingers " only contributes to what we must end in @entity122 : a toxic political environment			2
" " this is not a moment to point fingers and make accusations			0
but it is a time to pray for the victims -- and to pledge to each other that we will struggle for a more civil and decent @entity122 , " he wrote in a commentary on @entity0			0
despite the disconnect between cause and effect , @entity94 said he predicts there will be a softening of the tone on @entity143 as @entity39 returns to business as usual			2
" there will be an effort to avoid incendiary rhetoric			2
but as to whether that will have any effect in a macro sense on nationwide violence , i think it will not , " he said			2
before the shooting at the @entity25 political meet - and - greet , @entity154 lawmakers were preparing to vote on the repeal of the health care legislation this week			1
the debate leading up to the passage of the @entity75 ' health care plan was bitterly partisan , and the attempt to repeal the legislation was expected to be equally volatile			1
the @entity154 instead decided to postpone all legislation scheduled for this week , replacing the health care vote with a resolution to honor the victims of the tragedy			1
the question remains whether @entity39 will be able to take up such an emotional and divisive issue without the negativity that surrounded the debate last year			2
@entity154 action postponed " it is n't just a question of heated rhetoric			1
of course , we are going to have heated rhetoric , " said @entity28 , the @entity30 professor , " but even with extreme partisanship there can be and needs to be civility			1
" @entity94 said an avoidance of the more incendiary language could last " as long as the sensitivity to the possibility of a connection between violence and language is around			0
" " but i think it will have diminishing returns			0
i think eventually the language will ratchet up again , " he said			0
@entity28 said that while the impact of words is difficult to measure , language can create an atmosphere , evoke emotion and drive people apart			0
" rhetoric can definitely have severe consequences or we would n't employ it , " he said .			0
