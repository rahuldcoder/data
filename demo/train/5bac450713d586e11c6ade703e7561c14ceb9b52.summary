-- with his baby boy dangerously ill and several hours ' flight away , @entity1 was not in the best frame of mind to be playing a golf tournament			1
should he go back to the @entity7 or stay in @entity8 and take the risk of further complications for one - year - old @entity11 , who was being treated for a respiratory virus at the @entity14 in @entity15 , @entity16 ? assured by his wife that there was nothing he could do to help , the @entity17 remained in the @entity21 and pulled off an emotional victory with a sensational shot at the final hole of the @entity25 on sunday			1
" when he was put into hospital on friday , i was panicking			2
he was not good for 12 to 14 hours there and as a parent that makes you feel very vulnerable , " the 34 - year - old told the @entity31 website			1
" i just wanted to go back home and look after the family , but my wife convinced me to stay			0
they were in good hands ; there was nothing i could do and she was telling me that , but when your kids get sick you do n't think straight			0
" however , he held it together enough to sink a huge eagle putt on the final hole to win his fifth @entity31 title by two shots from @entity51 's @entity50 and @entity53 's @entity52 at the @entity55 course			1
" it 's always a nice feeling , but especially this week with how things have been with my son being a little bit ill , " said @entity1 , who will play for @entity8 against the @entity7 at the @entity56 this month			1
" he has managed to get over that and he 's getting better and better , which is the most important thing			2
" @entity1 , who also has membership of the @entity64 this season , had looked like missing out when , trailing @entity50 by one shot , he drove into the trees at the 16th hole			1
" i had a little gap between the two trees and i needed to hit it through that with a bit of draw			0
sometimes you have to take a chance and a risk and luckily it was my day , " said @entity1 , who pocketed the $ 380,000 first prize to be eighth in the race to @entity78 standings			2
" when we get a chance to lift these trophies , something just clicks in your head			0
i was just trying to stay focused			0
it 's been a bit of a slow summer for me , so this came at a perfect time to get confidence back and feel ready for the @entity56			2
" @entity52 birdied three of the last four holes to match @entity1 's final - round score of 67 , but was just short of repeating his victory at last week 's @entity99 in @entity100			1
" on the last hole i was thinking i could hole my eagle putt and have a little run around the green but he got in first , " he said after taking home $ 200,000 to go 17th in the money list with almost $ 1.2 million this season			1
" it did n't happen for me this week but i 'm proud that i gave it a go			0
the last three weeks have been great			0
sixth , a victory and second			0
it 's nice to see hard work paying off			0
