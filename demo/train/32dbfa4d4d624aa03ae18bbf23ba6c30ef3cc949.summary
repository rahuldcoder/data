-- being a product of the @entity4 school system , i ca n't help but love @entity5			1
my middle and junior high schools were located on a @entity8			2
@entity9 , abolitionism and tolerance have always seemed like good ideas to me			2
and i 'm a total sucker for @entity14 packaging			1
@entity15 married @entity16 in a 1940 @entity14 ceremony at the @entity18 in @entity19 , @entity20			1
but the fact is , aside from @entity23 and @entity24 , i really do n't know that many famous @entity5			2
so i decided to look ' em up			2
here 's what i found ... 1			2
@entity15 people made such a big deal about @entity30 being a @entity31			1
so it 's interesting to note that old @entity33 was born and raised @entity14			1
his strict mother instilled conservative quaker values in him ( no swearing , drinking or dancing )			1
when he could n't afford to go to @entity39 ( despite earning a scholarship there ) , he attended @entity42 - a local @entity14 college where he became class president , started a frat , practiced with the football team , and even spent his sundays teaching @entity47 to little tykes			1
@entity49 @entity51 settler , hunter , and folk hero @entity49 was born and raised @entity14			1
in fact , his family emigrated to the @entity51 from @entity56 partially for that reason			2
what 's more interesting , however , is why the @entity49 family did n't stay within the fold			2
apparently , @entity62 's sister @entity61 made waves in the community when she married a non-quaker			2
that , in itself , might not have caused a controversy			2
the fact that she was visibly pregnant at the time did			2
the family publicly apologized for their daughter 's behavior			0
but after their son @entity77 also married a @entity65 , the @entity49 's became a famiglia non grata and up and moved to @entity78			0
@entity79 if you 're wondering how folk singer @entity79 's religion might have played into her development as a political activist , you might want to take a look at her father 's life choices			0
@entity87 converted to @entity88 when @entity79 was a youngster , and despite being a co-inventor of the x-ray microscope and a well - known physicist , he refused to work on the atomic bomb project in @entity93 , and also turned down lucrative job offers from defense contractors during the @entity96			0
@entity97 if you love @entity99 's chocolates , you definitely owe a note of thanks to the @entity102			0
as a young man , @entity99 hoped to pursue a career in medicine or law			0
but because @entity5 were discriminated against by all of the major universities at the time , @entity97 decided to focus on business			0
believing that alcohol only exacerbated society 's ills , @entity99 decided to focus on a happy alternative : chocolate and drinking cocoas			0
in addition to his views on temperance , @entity99 was also a bit of an activist			0
he led a campaign to stop the use of boys as chimney sweeps , and he founded an organization to prevent animal cruelty			0
@entity129 sent off to be raised by his father 's sister in @entity133 , @entity134 , @entity129 was raised @entity14			1
and though the faith may not have played the biggest role in his life or career ( there are tales that it was through befriending a @entity144 reverend that he was encouraged to pursue his loves of bullfighting , car racing and theater ) , today he 's buried in a @entity14 cemetery			1
@entity150 born in @entity151 to @entity14 parents			1
amazingly , for the first 6 years of his life , the famed reporter grew up in a log cabin without plumbing or electricity			0
his parents , who farmed for a living , made only a few hundred dollars a year , at least until they picked up and moved to @entity160			1
@entity161 while agnostic today , best - selling science fiction author @entity161 grew up in a fairly devout family			0
during the @entity163 his parents left young @entity164 and his sister to their grandparents care , and then went to " fight " in @entity168			1
in his own words , " my parents were helping to keep those devastated children alive , by importing food and milk and feeding them on a regular basis			1
it was worthy work , and i do n't fault it , but there was a personal cost			0
@entity179 the award - winning actress converted to @entity88 after attending a friends school			1
according to @entity182 , she was first attracted to the faith because she loved the school uniforms			0
@entity185 the sharp - shooting female who was rumored to split playing cards edge-wise , then shoot through them a few times before they hit the ground , grew up a dirt - poor @entity14			1
in fact , her early skill with the gun came from having to hunt food for her impoverished family			0
@entity197 in her own words , " i grew up ... in a @entity14 family , and for me being @entity14 was a political calling rather than a religious one			1
@entity203 the @entity205 surgeon who promoted cleanliness and sterility ( and for whom @entity209 mouthwash is named ) grew up in a wealthy @entity14 family			1
of course , this did n't stop him from being discriminated against			0
in fact , @entity203 studied medicine at the @entity215 precisely because it was one of the only institutions at the time which accepted @entity5			0
@entity219 according to @entity221 , the musician to - be was regularly encouraged by his mother 's " tolerant @entity14 philosophies			1
" that , along with the constant drone of @entity226 and @entity51 folk music in the house , supposedly played a large role in his eventual career choice			0
@entity231 i really only included @entity241 because i have a fondness for his @entity236 prints ( one used to hang over my puppy 's sleeping cushion in my old house )			0
still , it 's pretty interesting to know that the painter was born to @entity5 in @entity244 , and that he 's oft - credited with creating @entity245 , or those novelty photo scenes you pay $ 2 to stick your head into , to make your body look muscle - bound at the beach			1
