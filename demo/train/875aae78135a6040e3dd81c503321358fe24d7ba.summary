-- a year ago , @entity1 was a soft - spoken , 115 pound , football - playing freshman whose tug - of - war with a teacher over ' the hit list , " a note about kids he wanted to tackle on the field , landed him in handcuffs and ultimately led to his expulsion			1
he 's still soft spoken , but after eight months on house arrest and self - imposed isolation from friends , he 's grown			2
he 's taller , heavier			0
and there 's a subtle resolve in his voice now			0
the @entity21 , @entity22 , teen said his brush with a zero - tolerance discipline law aged him , made him a man			1
" i want to be accepted as a different person , not as a criminal for getting kicked out of school , " @entity1 said			1
" i want to have a chance at going to another school to prove myself			2
" @entity1 is exactly the kind of student the @entity34 departments have concluded is disproportionately impacted by strict , 1990s - era tough - on - crime school discipline policies that call for suspensions , expulsions and even arrests for sometimes minor infractions			1
school - to - prison pipeline the two federal agencies are now urging the nation 's school districts to dial back harsh punishments that all too often result in african - american and @entity47 kids being funneled into what some members of @entity49 and student advocates call the " school - to - prison pipeline			1
" research from education and civil rights organizations has consistently shown that students who are repeatedly suspended and expelled from school are more likely to eventually end up behind bars			2
" a routine school disciplinary infraction should land a student in the principal 's office , not in a police precinct , " attorney general @entity59 said in a recent statement			2
@entity66 realities @entity67 said in a statement it is prohibited by federal confidentiality laws from discussing @entity1 's case			2
superintendent @entity71 said the issues raised in @entity1 's case " presents an opportunity for citizens to examine zero - tolerance laws in @entity22			1
" @entity1 's mother , @entity76 , said zero tolerance forced her child to learn the harsh realities of life as a young black man in @entity82			2
" it changed him , " his mother said , her voice softening			0
" it makes me so sad			0
" racial discrimination is at the root of the problem , according to student advocates			1
the two federal agencies tasked with investigating such matters agree			2
" in our investigations , we have found cases where @entity46 students were disciplined more harshly and more frequently because of their race than similarly situated white students , " the @entity34 departments wrote in a recent letter to the nation 's school districts			2
" in short , racial discrimination in school discipline is a real problem			1
" in its survey of the nation 's public schools , the agencies ' civil rights divisions found that , though @entity46 - @entity46 students who are n't disabled make up 15 % of the country 's student body , they " are more than three times as likely as their white peers without disabilities to be expelled or suspended			1
" @entity46 - @entity46 students also " make up 35 % of students suspended once , 44 % of those suspended more than once , and 36 % of students expelled			2
further , more than 50 % of students who were involved in school - related arrests or referred to law enforcement are @entity47 or @entity46 , " the report found			1
zero tolerance makes zero sense : @entity124 punished for helping drunk friend for the @entity127 and other civil rights groups , those figures highlighted the insidious nature of racial discrimination			1
" i think there is wider recognition today of the wider consequences of zero - tolerance policies than there was a few years ago and part of that is because of the disproportionate impact on minority students and disabled students because it contributes to the achievement gap , " said @entity131 , field director for the @entity127 of @entity22 on the impact of harsh penalties on the persistent gap between white and minority academic achievement			1
feels like hands are tied for its part , the @entity67 feels its hands are tied by zero - tolerance policy laws			1
" zero tolerance takes away the flexibility of school districts to individualize the consequences commensurate with the circumstances , " superintendent @entity71 said in a statement			1
" it is up to state policy makers to revise these zero - tolerance laws , and until that happens , we will continue to follow our legal mandates as they are			1
" the @entity127 along with other organizations are working on just that and point out that @entity21 officials were aware already in the midst of addressing the disproportionate suspensions of minority kids when @entity1 was expelled			2
" if this could happen in a district where people actually get it , @entity170 help the rest of these kids , " @entity131 said			2
the @entity127 is now working with the state 's school districts , education organizations and @entity22 lawmakers to help change the zero - tolerance law			1
they hope to help introduce new legislation this spring			0
others , such as @entity184 , an educational scholar with the conservative @entity185 , said the @entity34 departments are so focused on blaming racism that they ignore the fact that perhaps minority kids just have worse behavior in school			1
worries expressed there are two reasons minority kids are disproportionately kicked out of school , @entity184 said			1
" the first is prejudice either overt or intentional ... the second reason is low income or minority kids are misbehaving at higher rates for whatever reason , " @entity184 said			0
" my experience is that it 's probably some mix of the two			0
" he said rates of punishment " should be identical across classes and races			0
but that only makes sense if the behavior is the same across race and classes			0
" @entity184 called the federal efforts " laudable , " but worries " the @entity214 has turned a room full of civil rights lawyers on one problem			0
lawyers have one lens but i 'm concerned they have n't thought about the practical concerns			0
" those practical concerns include additional funding to help keep all kids and school staff safe , said @entity224 , executive director of the @entity225 and a former superintendent of @entity227 , @entity228 , public schools			1
he notes that federal money once available to help schools address discipline was nixed in 2011 though there are competitive grants available			1
" it comes back to what is our mission , " @entity224 said			0
" our mission is to provide for the needs of children			0
and the expulsion of kids who more than anyone else need to be in school is inappropriate			1
the nation 's educators and parents were gripped with fear after a 1999 shooting spree by two seniors at @entity256 in @entity257 killed a teacher and 12 students			0
and in @entity248 's shadow , districts adopted zero - tolerance policies as a way to grapple with an increase in violence on their campuses			1
@entity49 had previously passed a federal law in 1995 requiring the expulsion of any student who brought a gun to school			1
but after @entity248 , problem - plagued districts with a history of school violence , and the lawmakers who represented them touted the benefits of zero tolerance as a solution to their woes			1
as a presidential candidate , then @entity285 gov. @entity284 advocated zero tolerance as a solution to school violence			1
but the policies , credited by some as helping remove gun and knife wielding young thugs from the classroom also resulted in kindergarteners being suspended for pretending to shoot guns and kids being expelled for using pocketknives for art projects			2
in @entity302 , @entity303 , zero tolerance resulted in @entity46 - @entity46 students being pulled out of school for such things as talking back			1
the students , according to a @entity214 investigation , were sent to a juvenile detention facility in @entity310 with tiny , dirty cells where they were often maced for not following the rules			0
in @entity314 , @entity285 , @entity46 - @entity46 students were issued costly criminal misdemeanor " tickets " for talking , cursing or fighting so often that the @entity317 launched an investigation into the matter late last year			0
a packed hearing during a 2012 @entity322 subcommittee hearing on the " school - to - prison " pipeline , worried parents and educators jammed the hearing and an overflow room			2
" for many young people , our schools are increasingly a gateway to the criminal justice system , " said sen. @entity329 , @entity330 , who chaired the hearing			0
zero - tolerance policies " are not terribly effective and it 's certainly not effective in changing children 's behavior , " said @entity336 , deputy director of @entity337 , a group that has worked to break the " school - to - prison pipeline			1
" over the summer , @entity1 became so depressed about his expulsion that his mother worried about him			0
she got him a therapist and a physical trainer to help channel his feelings			0
late last year she enrolled him in a private , @entity349 school			0
it 's a small school with only 40 students and no football team			0
but no other area school would accept him with his discipline record			2
" he still avoids people , " his mother said adding that he 's just not the same kid			0
" he does n't want to be around people from his own school			0
he 's very embarrassed he does n't want to talk about it			0
" as a mother , she says she wants to take away the hurt			0
as a woman raising a young man she said she wants to teach him to always hold his head high and stand firm against injustice			0
" i just tell him what you did was not criminal and you 're not a criminal			0
" student suspended for giving a hug			0
