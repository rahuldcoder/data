-- @entity2 's chances of retaining the @entity4 title suffered another setback on sunday as struggling @entity6 snatched a last - gasp 3 - 3 draw in @entity8			1
@entity10 's team had fought back to lead 3 - 2 with two goals in the last 10 minutes , but poor defending allowed young @entity6 fullback @entity12 to equalize with a free header in the second minute of time added on			1
the result left @entity2 in fifth place , a point behind @entity18 and six adrift of the leading @entity21 clubs @entity22 and @entity23			2
the @entity24 ended 2010 with a morale - boosting win over @entity27 last wednesday , and looked like extending that form when @entity29 scored his first goal since returning from long - term injury in the 23rd minute			2
the influential midfielder netted a penalty after @entity34 was punished for a clumsy shove from behind on @entity36 , but @entity6 equalized four minutes before halftime when @entity38 smashed home another spotkick following @entity42 's foul on @entity43			0
new year , new @entity44 as @entity22 stay top former @entity47 striker @entity46 put @entity6 ahead two minutes after the break with a powerful header from @entity51 's cross , but @entity2 's relentless pressure finally told in the 84th minute when @entity53 fired home a low shot after the visitors could not clear his clever chest - down to @entity36			1
defender @entity58 then popped up to slot in a rare goal with a minute to go in regulation time after @entity6 's otherwise excellent goalkeeper @entity62 could only parry @entity53 's header into the former @entity47 captain 's path			1
that sparked scenes of jubilation and relief on the @entity2 bench , but @entity6 left @entity10 's future in some doubt when the 21 - year - old @entity12 stole into the penalty area unmarked to head home a teasing cross from substitute @entity76			1
@entity2 have now won only once in eight league games , having played one more game than @entity22 -- a situation that is unlikely to please the club 's billionaire owner @entity80			0
" we needed to win this game			0
we did n't and now it 's more difficult to prepare for the next game , " @entity85 coach @entity10 told reporters			0
" i 'm disappointed because we worked very hard in the second half to come back into the game when 2 - 1 down			1
we did a fantastic job , we came back and scored to make it 3 - 2 and everyone thought the game was finished			2
" while @entity10 will have to face more questions about his increasingly insecure tenure , the result lifted the pressure on @entity6 's @entity98 manager @entity97 , whose team moved two points clear of the bottom three			2
@entity103 's heroes and villains of 2010 " it 's a massive point , " @entity105 veteran @entity62 told match broadcaster @entity106			0
" we 've been in such a bad run of form we needed something , and it 's great to get it at @entity114			0
" we 've got over what i thought was a poor penalty decision against us at the start and we 've fought back , and hopefully this will kick - start our season and we can get back up the table			1
" in sunday 's late game , @entity122 won 1 - 0 at @entity124 to give new manager @entity125 his second victory after two successive defeats			1
striker @entity128 , playing alone up front in place of @entity47 striker @entity131 , scored a 19th - minute winner from close range after @entity135 's shot was blocked and @entity136 poked the follow - up against the post			0
@entity122 moved up to 10th place , above @entity140 on goal difference but below @entity142 , to be six points clear of the bottom three			0
defenders @entity145 and @entity146 headed against the bar , while @entity148 struck the woodwork for @entity124 , who remained just a point above the relegation zone			0
meanwhile , @entity153 moved four points clear in the @entity155 with a 2 - 0 victory at defending champions @entity157 as @entity160 striker @entity159 netted both goals , the second from the penalty spot after he was fouled			1
rangers have played two fewer games than their @entity167 rivals following recent postponements due to snowy weather in @entity170 .			0

@entity6 deny @entity2 a much - needed victory with a late equalizer in six - goal *thriller*
@entity4 champions fought back from 2 - 1 down to lead with a minute to play
struggling @entity6 earn a *precious* point in time added on to leave @entity2 in fifth place
*newcastle* win 1 - 0 at @entity124 to give new manager @entity125 his second victory
