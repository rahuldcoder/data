@entity0 , @entity1 -- the edges of the massive @entity5 oil slick grazed the barrier islands off @entity1 's @entity7 and @entity8 sounds tuesday as the company responsible for cleaning up the spill faced tough questions from members of @entity13			1
with a damaged undersea well still spewing crude oil into the @entity17 , @entity1 's coastal parishes made new plans to keep the oil from moving into @entity20 and @entity21 , which flank @entity0			1
winds that complicated efforts to fight the spill died down tuesday , making cleanup work easier , @entity22 rear adm. @entity22 said			2
" it 's a gift of a little bit of time , " she told reporters			0
" but i 'm not resting			0
" the spill threatens wildlife , beaches and livelihoods along the @entity5			1
already federal officials have banned fishing in the affected area until at least may 12 , curtailing a commercial seafood industry that brings in about $ 2.4 billion to the region every year			0
the leading edge of the slick was reported to be lapping at the edge of @entity1 's @entity7 early tuesday , @entity1 gov. @entity40 said			1
" let 's make no mistake about what 's at stake here			1
this is our very way of life , " @entity40 told reporters			1
" this is our fishing communities , these are some of our coastal communities			0
we 're talking about keeping this oil out of our fragile wetlands			1
" but as of mid-afternoon , no oil had been found washed up on the islands , said @entity61 , chief operating officer for @entity62 , which owns the damaged well			1
" to give you a sense of our ability to respond , we launched 22 vessels , " @entity61 told reporters at a news conference in @entity66 , @entity67			0
twelve of those vessels were shrimp boats whose skippers have volunteered to assist in the cleanup , he said			0
" they 've been in the area ever since trying to locate that oil and make sure it actually does n't reach shore , " @entity61 said			1
the edge of the slick was reported to be about 20 miles off the @entity84 , and @entity85 said it was about 30 miles off the shores of @entity67			1
@entity61 said @entity62 workers expected to close off one of the three leaking points tuesday , but added , " i do n't believe that will change the total amount of oil that will be leaked			1
" @entity93 , chef and owner of @entity95 on the north shore of @entity21 , said the potential impact was " tremendous			0
" but @entity93 , who holds a degree in fish biology and lived in the marshes for 10 years before entering the restaurant business , expressed surprise that the story has become a national one			1
" i 'm really astounded that the rest of the people in the @entity107 really give a flip about this , " he said			0
@entity1 's coastal marshlands have been shrinking at the rate of two football fields a day for a quarter - century , he said , " and nobody gave a flip about that			1
" @entity93 's 16 - table restaurant , located 25 miles from @entity0 , specializes in @entity117 , and at least half of his orders are for meals that contain fish			0
in anticipation of rising prices , he ordered an extra gallon of shucked oysters and another case of shrimp , but that was all his refrigerators could store , the 56 - year - old restaurateur said			0
the estimated 210,000 - gallon - per - day flow of oil from the damaged well continued unabated tuesday , 12 days after the drilling rig @entity130 sank off @entity1			1
the break in the winds kept the slick from advancing much toward the coast , but @entity40 said the weather is expected to turn unfavorably thursday			1
the first oil was not expected to reach the shores of the @entity107 mainland for another three days , @entity61 said			1
as owner of the well , @entity62 is responsible for the cleanup and its costs			0
it blames @entity146 , which it hired to drill the well , for the failure of a critical piece of equipment that was designed to shut off the well in case of emergency			0
across the @entity5 , emergency workers and volunteers helped string floating booms across inlets and beaches in an attempt to fend off any advancing oil			1
chocolate - colored streaks of oily water could be seen off @entity164 , on the @entity67 coast			0
and crew boats that normally supply oil wells were laying booms around @entity169 , off the shores of @entity84 and about 10 miles north of the spill 's leading edge			2
but capt. @entity173 , who runs excursions out to the @entity176 barrier islands , said efforts to protect the islands and waterways were inadequate			2
he said @entity84 gov. @entity180 -- who called the spill " a manageable problem " monday -- was doing less to combat the oncoming slick than his counterparts in @entity67 and @entity1			1
@entity185 : community rallies around rig families " the governor 's leaving it up to @entity62			1
they 're just not doing enough , " @entity173 said			0
@entity62 hopes to place a four - story - high metal container over part of the leaking drill pipe , a step it says could corral about 80 percent of the leaking oil			2
the oil would then be pumped to a drill ship on the surface			2
@entity61 said the 70 - ton box could be ferried out to the site of the leak by midnight wednesday , but it will take another two days to place the device on the seabed			2
then it must be connected to the drill ship			0
" hopefully , we 'll be operational within about about six days , " he said			2
hundreds of thousands of feet of booms have been strung around the estuaries of southeastern @entity1 , @entity84 , @entity67 and far western @entity210 in recent days			1
but an aerial tour conducted by the @entity212 on tuesday showed some have already given way , and high winds in recent days have driven oil past others			1
the @entity130 caught fire april 20 and burned for two days before sinking , with 11 workers presumed dead			1
executives from @entity62 and @entity146 , looked " like deer in the headlights " when they briefed members of the @entity222 about the accident and response on tuesday , said rep. @entity227 , @entity228			0
@entity229 : @entity17 shrimp season to temporarily close @entity227 is a strong supporter of offshore drilling , and told reporters he did n't want the accident to reverse support for more exploration off the @entity107 coasts			2
but he said he had hoped for " more concrete " answers from the oilmen			0
" i have concerns in this particular case about the attention to safety , the attention to maintenance , the attention to using best available control technology and best monitoring practices , " @entity227 said			0
rep. @entity247 , @entity248 , said the situation could get dramatically worse			0
" one of the questions which i asked was what would happen if a worst - case scenario did unfold ? " he told reporters after the hearing			0
" i was told that the amount of oil per day could actually rise from 5,000 to 60,000 barrels of oil a day , although in a worst - case scenario , the most likely number was in the 40,000 barrel range , which only reinforces the necessity of us acting as quickly as possible , for @entity62 and all responsible , for shutting off this catastrophic leak of oil			2
" but @entity267 , the executive vice president of @entity62 , said the company is " doing everything we can to respond to this incident			2
" " that 's our complete focus right now -- to stop the leak at the scene , to disperse the oil the best we can and protect the beaches and mitigate the impact , " he said			2
" that 's what we 're doing			0
" that may not be enough to satisfy lawmakers , said sen. @entity282 , @entity210			0
" privately , i 've gone up to some senators who have been for drilling and i have sarcastically said to them , in a whisper , ' drill , baby , drill , ' and they roll their eyes as if in mock horror at the possibilities of what could happen as a result of this disaster			2
" @entity2 's @entity294 , @entity295 and @entity296 contributed to this report .			0
