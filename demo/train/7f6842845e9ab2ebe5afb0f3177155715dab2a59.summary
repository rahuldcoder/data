-- despite the many questions surrounding a reported altercation between @entity4 and her brother - in - law @entity5 , you would n't know it based on how the rapper and his wife @entity8 are acting			1
a recent surveillance video which appears to show the singer , fashionista and younger sister of @entity8 attacking the " @entity14 " rapper has not only sparked an avalanche of memes , but also much speculation as to what led to the alleged incident , initially reported by @entity20 , in the first place			1
so far none of the trio are speaking about it directly			2
monday night , @entity8 and @entity5 appeared together courtside -- as they often do -- at a @entity27 game			1
the rapper formerly had a minority ownership stake in the team			2
following the alleged incident , @entity8 posted a prayer on her official @entity34 account			1
" help me to choose my friends wisely so i wo n't be led astray , " it says			2
" give me discernment and strength to separate myself from anyone who is not a good influence			2
" for her part , @entity4 has reportedly deleted a picture of her sister from the night of the @entity44 from her @entity34 account			1
and you thought your family had issues			2
as crisis communications expert @entity49 told @entity0 , " @entity5 and @entity8 have all the money and power in the world , and they could n't keep it under wraps apparently			1
" not that it 's easy for such public figures , he added			1
" how do you keep it under wraps ? you go in your private limo with a chauffeur that 's signed a nondisclosure agreement , you go to a private home behind gates , you never go out in public , " @entity49 said			1
" once you step out of that cocoon , you 're fair game , and there are paparazzi and media that have a price on your head like a hunted animal			1
" the younger @entity4 , 27 , grew up in the spotlight also , though it was a bit dimmer than the one on her famous sister			2
as a young teen , @entity4 danced backup for her sister 's former group @entity82 , and at the age of 16 released her debut album , " @entity86			2
" @entity4 told @entity87 in a recent interview that despite her now - divorced parents ' being a driving force in @entity8 's career , they were more cautious when it came to her			1
" my parents constantly tried to talk me out of being an artist , " @entity4 said			0
" they had gone through the whole journey with my sister and just wanted me to have a normal teenage life			0
" that did n't quite pan out , as the aspiring artist got pregnant at the age of 17 and soon married her son 's father			0
they divorced a few years later			0
@entity4 has been quoted as saying her family was instrumental in helping her survive the rigors of being a young single mother and that she and @entity8 have an especially tight bond			1
" it definitely was tough , having your sister have a built - in @entity112 ( @entity82 member @entity113 , who lived with the @entity4 family when she was younger ) and me being five years younger , " @entity4 told the @entity111			0
" but my sister was very protective of me , and we were very sweet with each other			0
i 'm sure if we were closer in age we would n't have gotten along so great			0
but we 've been super-close ever since i was about 13			0
" so close that @entity4 has written hit songs for her sister , including " @entity121 " but despite the pair 's shared love of music and fashion , @entity8 told the @entity126 in 2012 that there was one area her younger sister refused to bend on			1
" my sister will not record with me , " the elder @entity4 said			0
" she 's her own woman			0
" so much so that @entity130 has rounded up some of @entity4 ' most outspoken moments , including the time she snapped at a tv interviewer , " i have to say , that was not a very professional introduction before			0
please do n't tie me into family and my brother - in - law 's establishment			0
" according to @entity143 , such behavior as what allegedly happened inside @entity142 elevator is nothing new for @entity8 and @entity5 the magazine quotes an anonymous source as saying , " @entity4 has flipped her lid like that before			1
" @entity145 quoted an unnamed source as saying @entity4 was " provoked " prior to the alleged incident			0
@entity0 's @entity151 contributed to this report .			0
