@entity0 -- the administration 's top counterterrorism adviser said thursday he was aware of the @entity5 's enhanced interrogation techniques that critics describe as torture while serving as a top official at the agency but did nothing to stop them because he had no oversight role			1
" i did not take steps to stop the @entity5 use of those techniques , " @entity13 told his @entity15 confirmation hearing			2
@entity13 was nominated by president @entity19 to lead the spy agency after gen. @entity21 resigned from the job over an extramarital affair			1
the issue was controversial in the administration of former president @entity26 in the aftermath of the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks			0
in answering questions about the techniques , @entity13 acknowledged that he knew another part of the agency was carrying out a directive from the @entity26 administration			2
five things we learned from @entity13 's confirmation hearing " i had awareness that the agency was being asked to do it ; i was aware that the agency was moving ahead on it , " he told the @entity40 , adding that he was not involved in managing it			1
at the time , @entity13 was the @entity5 's deputy executive director			1
on the same issue , @entity13 said a committee report on the interrogation techniques contained " disturbing " information that raised questions about whether he knew what really happened			2
the 6,000 - page report took six years to compile , and @entity13 said he read the 300 - page executive summary before thursday 's hearing			1
" now i have to determine what the truth is , " he said			0
" i do not know what the truth is			0
" under persistent questioning by sen. @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity13 pledged that waterboarding would never be used under his direction , but he refused to label it torture			2
on the issue of drone strikes on terrorist targets abroad , @entity13 defended the 2011 killing of @entity69 @entity68 as part of the war against @entity72			1
@entity13 said @entity68 's involvement in efforts to kill @entity75 made him a legitimate military target			1
under prodding from committee chairwoman sen. @entity77 , @entity79 , @entity13 confirmed a connection between @entity68 and @entity81 , who failed in his attempt to detonate an explosive in his underwear as his @entity85 flight approached @entity86 on christmas day in 2009			2
however , @entity13 offered no details of the connection , and noted @entity68 's role as a propagandist for @entity72 who fomented @entity92 sentiments via the @entity93			1
the hearing was temporarily halted at the start when protesters repeatedly interrupted @entity13 's opening statement			1
some waved signs accusing him of war crimes because of the drone attacks			0
@entity77 ordered the room cleared of spectators and told security officers to prevent the re-entry of protesters from @entity107 , which describes itself as a women - initiated group for peace and social justice			0
@entity13 is considered to be behind the administration 's dramatic rise in the use of drones against terrorist suspects			1
several strikes have killed @entity75 , notably @entity68			0
opinion : bring drones out of the shadows @entity13 defended the drone program , saying that @entity19 " insisted that any actions we take will be legally grounded , will be thoroughly anchored in intelligence , will have the appropriate review process , approval process before any action is contemplated , including those actions that might involve the use of lethal force			1
" " my role as the president 's counterterrorism adviser was to help to orchestrate this effort over the past four years to ensure , again , that any actions we take fully comport with our law and meet the standards that i think this committee and the @entity69 people expect of us as far as taking actions we need to protect the @entity69 people , but at the same time ensuring that we do everything possible before we need to resort to lethal force , " he said			2
an unclassified outline of the administration 's policy given last summer to @entity148 indicated that the government could use lethal force against an @entity69 overseas if the person was a senior operational leader of @entity72 or one of its affiliates and an attack was imminent			1
the @entity40 received a classified document on thursday that seeks to justify the administration 's policy of targeting @entity75 overseas via drone attacks , a congressional aide told @entity1			1
the document was demanded by lawmakers , mainly @entity159 concerned about secrecy in national security decision making , before @entity13 's hearing			1
it outlines the @entity165 's legal rationale for the policy of using lethal force against @entity75 citizens fighting on behalf of terrorist groups			2
@entity1 explains : @entity75 drones according to an official who spoke on the condition of not being identified , @entity19 decided to turn over the legal opinion because he believes the scrutiny and debate is healthy			2
on thursday , @entity176 chairman @entity175 , @entity177 , and ranking member @entity178 , @entity179 , sent a letter to @entity19 calling on him to share with the committee any legal memos on the targeted killings of @entity75 abroad			2
" the deliberate killing of a @entity75 citizen pursuant to a targeted operation authorized or aided by our government raises significant constitutional and legal concerns that fall squarely within the jurisdiction of the @entity40 , " they wrote			0
one of the questions the committee submitted to @entity13 in advance of the hearing asked how it was determined that an individual was associated with @entity72 and that a threat was imminent			1
@entity13 responded in writing that such decisions were made on a " case - by - case basis " in a process involving other agencies			0
the @entity202 said this week that questions on the matter have been weighed against legal concerns and discussed publicly			0
the @entity206 has held that the military may use force against an @entity69 who is part of enemy forces			0
still civil liberties and other groups want more answers			0
@entity214 said @entity148 should grill @entity13 on his claim that the @entity19 administration 's drone strikes are " conducted in full compliance with the law			1
" opinion : @entity13 , @entity19 's counterterrorist other controversies at hand @entity13 's chances to lead the @entity5 at the start of @entity19 's first term were scuttled by questions about the enhanced interrogations of terrorist suspects			1
at thursday 's hearing , @entity13 said he had raised objections with colleagues to the enhanced interrogation techniques , but denied any role in managing or enabling their use			2
asked if the techniques had yielded intelligence that saved lives , @entity13 did not answer directly			0
instead , he repeated his insistence that such techniques would never be used under his watch			0
@entity15 lawmakers also asked about @entity13 's role in administration leaks about covert operations , including a foiled @entity72 bomb plot in @entity247 involving a mole			1
he denied any wrongdoing , saying that he had gotten involved only after the leaks became public and that he tried to stem a " hemorrhaging " of leaked information in the matter			0
@entity13 acknowledged in his written responses to committee questions that he voluntarily was interviewed by prosecutors about two investigations			0
he said in both cases his counsel told him he was being interviewed as a witness , not a target			0
report : numerous countries involved in @entity5 interrogation programs a powerful figure at @entity202 as @entity5 director , @entity13 would report to @entity267 , the director of national intelligence			0
but he would also have a direct path to the president , talking to him on the phone or briefing him personally			0
@entity1 's @entity271 and @entity272 contributed to this report .			0

drone campaign against @entity72 has been legacy of @entity13 as @entity19 adviser
