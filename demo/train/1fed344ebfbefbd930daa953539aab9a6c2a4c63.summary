@entity0 , @entity1 -- you 've got your spot on a lounge chair angled into the hot @entity7 sun , with tall , slender palm trees jutting out over your head			1
as you gaze at the calm turquoise waters and sip that refreshing rum drink , you may ask yourself , " what more could i possibly want ? " visitors can climb the tower at @entity16 for a view over the rooftops and out to sea			0
for many travelers to the @entity1 , that chair -- usually secluded inside a mega all - inclusive resort complex -- is the sole destination			1
and do n't get me wrong , it 's a great one			2
the @entity1 's stretches of sand are some of the best on the planet			1
but if you never leave the high walls of your tourist compound , you 're missing out on a gem of a capital city			1
@entity0 is the @entity33 's first city , with 16th - century buildings , quaint colonial streets , romantic ruins and a lively atmosphere			1
all you need is a full day to experience the city 's architecture , culture and food			1
plus , it 's only a $ 9 coach bus ride from @entity44			2
so when you begin to tire of the antics of the " animation team " at the resort , and the color of your skin starts to resemble the papaya or watermelon you 're eating , consider a short trip to @entity0			1
founded soon after @entity55 set foot in the @entity33 , and run by his son @entity57 , the city became the colonial capital of the @entity59 and launch pad for further @entity62 expeditions			1
despite several raids by pirates , the oldest section of town remains largely intact			0
known as the @entity68 , it contains many @entity70 " firsts " in the @entity71 including the first street , cathedral , hospital and university			0
how to see it all in a day start at the heart of the zone , @entity79 , a square that borders the cathedral and is always full of life			2
you can sit and watch children chase pigeons as you gaze up at the simple beauty of the oldest cathedral in the @entity59			0
next , head over to the oldest fortress in the @entity33 , @entity16 , built in the early 1500s			1
there you can climb the tower for a view over the rooftops and out to sea			0
back on street level , walk up a couple blocks to the expansive @entity96 , site of two museums and a hangout for locals , especially in the evening , when kids crisscross the square on scooters or fly kites , and couples sit quietly together			0
the @entity105 and the @entity106 -- @entity108 ' palace -- show you how the wealthy @entity62 lived when they came to the early colonies and provide some history of the island 's colonization -- all for a buck or two			2
next , head over to a pair of impressive ruins			2
gaze up at the towering walls and arches of the @entity59 ' first hospital , @entity120			0
then , just up a picturesque bend in the road lined with colorful houses , you 'll find the large ruins of @entity125			2
pirate attacks and earthquakes brought down the monastery			0
the hospital was merely abandoned in the 18th century , and later dismantled for safety			2
now let yourself wander a bit through the streets , checking out the colorful surprises around every colonial corner			1
you 'll discover the varied architecture of people 's homes , and get a view into @entity1 city life			1
in just a few blocks , i ran across a pickup game of baseball , the national sport and passion , in the middle of the street , with adults using just a broom handle and roll of tape ; several " kiddie " pools in the streets , where both children and adults were cooling off in the afternoon heat ; and a handful of corner parks alive with activity			2
after exploring , your final destination is the zone 's main drag , @entity164			0
this pedestrian - only street is the place to shop			0
you 'll find street sellers hawking colorful artwork ; music stores to pick up that merengue and bachata music you 've heard blaring out of everyone 's stereos ; and jewelry shops featuring native amber and the sky - blue stone larimar found only in the @entity1			1
by now , you 've certainly worked up an appetite walking in the hot sun. @entity79 and @entity96 each have a row of chic sidewalk cafés , although they 're a bit pricey and touristy			0
consider wandering a bit through some side streets to find a more local establishment , where you can feast on typical cuisine such as @entity190 ( a red beans and rice dish ) , several stews , fried plantains or yucca and delicious tropical fruits			0
and if you still feel like dancing the night away , hop in a taxi to the @entity199 , @entity0 's seafront boulevard , where the large hotels have popular dance clubs pumping merengue until the wee hours of the morning			1
the bus ride getting to the capital city from the beach areas is cheap and relatively easy			1
@entity206 runs from the @entity44 area for $ 9 in an air - conditioned and comfy coach bus			0
on your four - hour ride , you 'll get a glimpse of some smaller @entity1 towns , a towering modern cathedral , distant mountains and vast sugarcane fields			1
@entity215 and @entity216 provide similar services from the beaches on the north coast around @entity220			0
the buses to / from @entity44 do n't run long into the evening ( they leave each side at 7 a.m. , 10 a.m. , 2 p.m. , and 4 p.m. ) , so you 'll want to make this an overnight trip			0
the @entity68 has several boutique hotels that are quaint , clean and reasonably priced			0
you could even arrange to fly out of @entity0 's @entity59 airport , rather than @entity44 .			1

@entity0 , the @entity1 's capital , was the @entity33 's first city
explore 16th - century buildings , colonial streets , romantic ruins and @entity1 city life
cheap , comfortable buses *connect* to the city from beach areas
