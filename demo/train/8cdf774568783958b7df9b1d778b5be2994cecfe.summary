-- a @entity2 think tank celebrated prince @entity3 on monday night for his humanitarian efforts , with the @entity6 royal deflecting the praise by offering his own salute to wounded war veterans			1
@entity3 was among the guests of honor at the event marking the 50th anniversary of the @entity14 , which describes itself as a " nonpartisan institution devoted to promoting transatlantic cooperation and international security			1
" the grandson of @entity19 arrived around 6:15 p.m. at the @entity20 in a black tux , with photographers yelling his name and a few girls shrieking as he walked inside			0
less than two hours later , former @entity26 secretary of state @entity25 took the stage to formally present prince @entity3 with the council 's @entity28 , an honor most recently bestowed on @entity32 frontman and activist @entity33			1
third in line to the @entity6 throne , @entity3 is a captain and @entity37 helicopter pilot in @entity6 's @entity38			2
@entity25 , himself a longtime soldier and one - time @entity41 chairman , was quick to point that out			2
he also joked that thanks to the 27 - year - old royal , " we have a record number of young , single women attending ( the @entity14 awards dinner ) this year			1
more seriously , @entity25 cheered @entity3 -- like his brother , @entity50 -- for embracing " the noble traditions of service to his country and to his fellow human beings			1
" he singled out their work with veterans through @entity59 , walking with the @entity60 and other such programs			0
" the loving effort that princess @entity63 made to teach her sons the importance of serving others has touched ( their ) hearts and souls , " said @entity25			2
" they have acted together in support of veterans ' charities ... and the impact of ( that ) work is already very , very significant			0
" @entity3 then took the stage , admitting it was a " truly humbling and a little terrifying " to follow @entity25 and that he did not " feel that i have done nearly enough to deserve " the award			1
still , he said he 'd accept it " on behalf of my brother , @entity50 , our foundation ( and ) all those guys on both sides of the @entity84 who work so tirelessly to support our veterans			0
" he paid special tribute to troops who have been scarred in one way or another while serving their nations , stressing the importance of giving them supporting well after they leave the battlefield			2
" they have paid a terrible price to keep us safe and free , " @entity3 said			1
" the very least we owe them is to make sure that they and their brave families have everything they need through their darkest days -- and , in time , regain the hope and confidence to flourish again			0
" for these selfless people , it ( is ) after the guns have fallen silent ( and ) the din of battle quieted that the real fight begins -- a fight that may last for the rest of their lives			0
" hours before the event , the prince met with injured soldiers at an event at the @entity118 in @entity2			0
it is his first trip to the capital , although not to the @entity26			0
he went to the deserts of @entity123 and @entity124 last year to take part in helicopter training			0
and it comes after @entity50 and his new wife , @entity128 , the @entity128 , were met with huge and enthusiastic crowds during their visit last year to the @entity26 and @entity131			0
