@entity0 , @entity1 -- final results of last month 's referendum show an overwhelming majority of southern @entity7 voted to split from the north , a result that will lead to the creation of the world 's newest nation , the referendum commission said monday			1
the chairman of the @entity14 , which organized the vote and includes members from both sides , said 98.83 % voted for separation , while 1.17 % voted for unity			1
" it was a peaceful process , " chairman @entity20 said at a ceremony in @entity0 attended by @entity7 politicians , international diplomats , @entity25 staff , academics and others			0
" it was a transparent process			0
" " not a single person " showed up to appeal the results , he said			2
preliminary results had shown overwhelming support for separation			2
the commission met monday with @entity7 president @entity38 and first vice president @entity39 to present the final results , state tv reported earlier			1
@entity38 has stated his commitment to the results and said he will accept them , state tv said			2
as a result of the government 's acceptance of the results , the @entity47 is beginning the process of removing @entity1 from its list of state sponsors of terrorism , @entity46 spokesman @entity45 said monday			1
@entity47 president @entity56 announced @entity58 's intention to recognize @entity1 as a sovereign , independent state in july , when a comprehensive peace agreement with the north is due to end			1
" after decades of conflict , the images of millions of southern @entity7 voters deciding their own future was an inspiration to the world and another step forward in @entity72 's long journey toward justice and democracy , " @entity56 said in a statement			1
" now , all parties have a responsibility to ensure that this historic moment of promise becomes a moment of lasting progress			0
the @entity81 must be fully implemented and outstanding disputes must be resolved peacefully			0
" @entity56 promised the @entity47 would support the governments of both @entity1 and @entity1 to ensure a smooth and peaceful transition to independence			1
prime minister @entity86 of @entity87 -- which ruled @entity1 between 1899 and 1955 -- said he welcomed the @entity0 government 's positive reaction to the results and said the @entity87 would support the country 's new chapter			1
" it is a happy day for southern @entity7 , " said @entity94 , 40 , an activist from the south			2
" we have gained our rights , our self - determination , and i hope the best for both southern and northern @entity7			0
and we will remain brothers			0
" those in the north had more varied opinions			2
" i think it is better , " said @entity105 , 30 , a grocery store owner			0
" they can have their own country , and our problem in the north will lessen			2
" northerner @entity110 , 27 , however , said he felt very sad about the outcome			0
" i believed that our strength is in our diversity , " he said			0
" this means the failure of the @entity7 national state , and i fear what might come			0
" there were tears on the face of @entity122 , a woman who is half northern and half southern , who cried , " why are we separating ? why are we separating ? " @entity1 's @entity124 fought a war for more than two decades , finally ending in a peace treaty in 2005 that paved the way for the referendum			1
the conflict , which left 2 million people dead , pitted a government dominated by @entity132 in northern @entity1 against black @entity133 and animists in the south			1
a majority of @entity1 's oil reserves are in the south , which was another flashpoint in the war			1
several million voters , including expatriates in the @entity47 and seven other countries , cast ballots			0
before @entity1 can become independent , the two sides still have to address various issues including currency , citizenship , national debt , and how to divide the majority of oil reserves found in the south			1
the @entity152 region -- which straddles the border between the regions -- remains a disputed area between the two sides			0
and as the world 's newest nation , @entity1 would face daunting obstacles			1
there is a desperate need for development in the south and a lack of a robust educated class to control the new levers of power			2
a flood of refugees , eagerly returning to an independent homeland , could complicate matters in a place that already lacks enough schools and clinics and has few paved roads			0
longstanding grievances among rival southern groups could erupt in violence ; several hundred southerners already have been killed in such fighting in the last year or two			2
or the north could refuse to accept the results or stir tensions by trying to pit one southern faction against another			1
the concerns run so deep that a year ago , @entity186 , then the @entity47 director of national intelligence , warned the @entity188 of possible genocide			0
" a number of countries in @entity72 and @entity192 are at significant risk for a new outbreak of mass killing " in the next five years , he said			0
" among these countries , a new mass killing or genocide is most likely to occur in @entity1			1
" @entity38 , wanted for war crimes after mass killings and rape in the country 's western @entity202 region , has said a southern vote for independence would be like " cutting off a part of the nation 's body , but not the @entity209			1
" still , @entity38 has said he wo n't hesitate to accept the results , because peace with the south is the ultimate goal			1
people in @entity1 have long felt dominated by the north , ever since slave - raiding parties from the region penetrated the south around 1840			1
the raids instilled a collective hostility toward northerners that successive generations in the south nursed until they erupted in open war			1
when it ruled @entity1 , @entity87 administered north and south as separate entities , preventing travel from one region to the other			1
the imbalance that resulted sparked southern fears of northern domination when the @entity87 announced plans to leave			2
@entity233 took up arms against the north in august 1955 , six months before @entity1 's independence			1
most jobs in the new national government went to people from the north , which also dominated the process of drafting a constitution			0
the insurgency that started in 1955 killed several hundred thousand people and forced many more from their homes , until a peace deal silenced the guns in 1972			0
barely a decade later , though , war resumed after the @entity7 president split the south into three regions and sought to impose @entity252 law on non-muslims			1
the 1989 coup that brought @entity38 to power let him steer the ship of state by the compass of @entity252 extremism			0
he praised the 1979 @entity261 revolution and offered shelter to many groups the @entity47 views as terrorist organizations			0
@entity265 arrived in @entity1 in 1991 , long before he became a household name			1
the @entity47 added @entity1 to its list of state sponsors of terrorism two years later			1
peace talks to end the war were well under way in 2003 when a mostly unrelated conflict erupted in the western @entity7 region of @entity202			0
marginalized @entity276 there rebelled against the government by attacking a military garrison			0
the @entity7 government responded by arming and cooperating with @entity281 militias that killed , tortured and raped thousands , mainly targeting tribes from which the rebels drew strength , according to the @entity25 , @entity288 governments and human rights organizations			0
the @entity25 says 300,000 people have been killed and 2.5 million displaced in @entity202 , though the government of @entity1 says the toll is lower			2
@entity38 's role in @entity202 led the @entity293 to indict him in 2009 on accusations of war crimes			2
even as the killing continued unabated in @entity202 , @entity38 's government made progress in negotiations with southern rebels			0
that progress resulted in a landmark agreement in january 2005 between the @entity7 government and the main rebel group in the south , the @entity305			2
the @entity81 called for the referendum that took place last month			0
journalist @entity308 in @entity0 and @entity2 's @entity309 and @entity310 in @entity311 contributed to this report .			0

the final results of january 's vote were announced monday
98.83 % of southerners voted for the split
it will create the world 's newest nation
