@entity0 -- face - to - face questioning of potential jurors to hear the case against @entity6 's doctor began in a packed @entity0 courtroom friday morning , four days ahead of the opening statements and testimony			1
the pool of 84 potential jurors in court appeared diverse , although only six were @entity13			1
each side will be allowed 10 " peremptory challenges , " allowing them to get rid of jurors without stating a reason			0
prosecutors and defense lawyers mutually agreed in closed - door sessions wednesday and thursday on which potential jurors in a pool of 145 were too biased to put their prejudices aside to decide if dr. @entity25 is criminally responsible for the pop icon 's death , according to @entity25 defense lawyer @entity28			1
" both sides just want to get a fair jury that has n't made up their mind and is willing to make a decision based upon the facts , " @entity28 said after thursday 's jury selection session			1
lead defense lawyer @entity35 said there were no surprising reasons for striking jurors " for cause , " and the pool was filled with people who could be open - minded			1
" @entity44 ameliorates things , " @entity43 said			0
@entity28 predicted thursday afternoon that friday 's jury selection would " go very fast			1
" while most judges allow defense lawyers an hour to question potential jurors , @entity47 is allowing just 20 minutes for each side , @entity28 said			1
" twenty minutes is a pretty short period of time , " @entity28 said			0
" you ca n't say ' hi ' to everybody in 20 minutes			0
" it is expected 12 jurors and six alternates will be chosen by the end of court friday			0
@entity25 , who is charged with involuntary manslaughter in @entity6 's death , would face up to four years in prison if the jury finds him guilty			2
the " for cause " strikes were based mostly on written answers potential jurors gave to 113 questions earlier this month			0
lawyers had a week to study the questionnaire responses , a process they went through once before in april before the trial was delayed for several months			0
" one of the things that we learned in the case the last go - around in the jury selection , it 's absolutely shocking how many jurors think already they know everything about this case , " @entity43 said in an interview last week with @entity75 , a reporter with @entity1 sister network @entity76			1
opening statements for the trial , which will be televised , are scheduled for september 27			2
the judge told members of the jury pool he expects their service will be over on or about october 28			0
the @entity0 coroner has ruled that @entity6 's death on june 25 , 2009 , was caused by an overdose of the surgical anesthetic propofol combined with other drugs			2
prosecutors have accused @entity25 , who served as @entity6 's personal and full - time physician at the time , of having a role in the overdose			2
they contend @entity25 used a makeshift intravenous drip to administer propofol intended to help @entity6 sleep , a practice they argue violated the standard of care and led to the pop music icon 's death .			0
