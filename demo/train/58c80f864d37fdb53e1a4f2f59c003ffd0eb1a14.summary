editor 's note : this story is part of @entity4 's taking the kids series			2
follow " taking the kids " on www.twitter.com , where @entity4 welcomes your questions and comments			2
( @entity11 ) -- no one cares that the water is cold			1
the kids splash at the lake 's edge , play on the small sand beach as older , daring ones splash in the water and peddle kayaks , rowboats and paddleboats			2
our pup eyes them all curiously			2
@entity25 , @entity26 -- home to two @entity27 -- is that iconic old - fashioned vacation spot that works as well for 21st - century families -- and their pooches -- as it did a century ago for families and millionaires who came here to the @entity34 with their family and friends			1
with 6 million acres , @entity37 is the largest state park in the @entity38 , larger than @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity42 national parks combined			1
it boasts more than 3,000 lakes and 2,000 miles of hiking trails and offers kayaking , canoeing , fishing and mountain biking			1
( @entity50 features 27 downhill and cross-country mountain bike trails that run between the ski trails , through streams and woods			2
) @entity25 , a town where everyone seems to be an athlete , or at least an outdoors enthusiast , has only 3,000 residents , but that number swells close to 10,000 in summer			1
@entity76 overlooks @entity77 and it 's lined with ice cream and coffee shops , all variety of restaurants ( sushi , @entity64 , steaks , a brewery , even a creperie , some with outdoor patios ) and stores selling @entity26 maple syrup , local chocolate , antique ski posters , local wines and cuddly stuffed moose			1
families stroll up and down @entity76 clutching kids ' hands , pushing them in strollers , hanging on to dogs , picnicking in front of the lake at the outdoor band shell			2
( simply gourmet is the spot for first - rate sandwiches and cookies for your hikes and picnics			1
) " the kids love it because it 's so safe we can let them go out on their own , " said @entity95 , here with a group of young freestyle skiers from @entity98 who practice their tricks by jumping into an icy pool at the @entity101			2
( you can test your mettle at the @entity108 and ride a wheeled bobsled , or check out the view of the @entity34 from the top of the 26 - story @entity27 ski jump			1
come july 4 and watch the 50th annual ski jump competition			0
" whatever the season there is something for the kids to do , " adds @entity115 , an attorney from @entity116 , @entity26 , who comes here often -- winter and summer -- with her two kids , husband and two dogs			1
we meet them hiking and splashing in @entity25 along the @entity126 that run for miles			1
our puppy , @entity129 , happily joined in			0
" even when the weather is bad , there are things to do			0
" ( bowling anyone ? ) there 's even some @entity136 history when you visit @entity140 @entity139 's farm and gravesite			0
but what sets this place apart -- besides the natural beauty and @entity27 history , as if that were n't enough -- is how genuinely friendly people are			1
it could n't be more kid friendly , @entity115 said			1
we learn that first - hand at the 166 - room @entity152 , which has an idyllic location on @entity77 ( smaller than @entity25 and ideal for young families )			1
the @entity156 family has run the @entity157 for more than 30 years , attracting families who return again and again			0
" we love the family - style management and the kids loved pretending to work behind the desk , " said @entity159 of @entity160			1
her family visits twice a year -- winter and summer			1
besides having fun , the kids might learn a thing or two about vacationing greener			0
the resort is the first , and so far only , one in the @entity172 to achieve 5 @entity173 from the @entity174 for its green initiatives			0
there are small touches like the paper shopping bags in each room to encourage guests to recycle cans and bottles			0
there is an allergen - free floor , bamboo flooring , a blooming green roof and sand , even small - framed placards placed around the hotel pointing out the green features			1
( kids are invited to take a " green quiz , " getting a mr. @entity195 coloring book , with suggestions on what they could do at home to be more earth friendly ( recycling one aluminum can conserves enough energy to run a tv for three hours			1
) " we want kids especially to realize they can help , " says @entity156 , the youngest of the three siblings now overseeing the hotel , which was first bought by their parents , who spearheaded the green initiatives			0
" the things you can do are n't difficult , " she says			0
" our goal is to get people thinking about it			0
" that extends to the resort restaurant , generations , where the family is set to harvest dinners , inviting farmers to showcase their wares			0
eventually , @entity220 , the mom of two young children , hopes families will be able to visit the area farms and see first - hand where the food on their plates came from			1
some families who come here might prefer a cabin or condo , though , and there are certainly plenty to choose from at every price point			2
if you 're coming with grown kids and want a laid back but luxurious respite -- or want to feel like you were one of those millionaires from a century - ago , check out the 30 - @entity239 , which was rebuilt after a fire to resemble a traditional @entity241			1
@entity242 , however , does n't welcome kids under 12 ( unless you book the entire place ) , but will pamper your dog			2
the @entity246 touts itself as summer camp - plus			1
it 's located on a lake with swimming , canoeing , kayaking and fishing			0
but there 's also a spa , three gourmet restaurants and , they promise , serenely comfy beds			0
the @entity258 starts at $ 299 per couple per night and kids are free			0
book two nights by june 21 to take advantage of this special rate and also receive a $ 50 resort credit			0
the @entity264 on the other hand has got everything a family could want			0
though not on the lake , it maintains a private beach a half - mile away with the requisite canoes , kayaks and more			2
this is the kind of place that offers the convenience of deluxe condos in the woods with the amenities of a first - class resort			2
( look for deals with substantial resort credits			0
) there 's a big heated pool , fitness center and spa where even tweens can get massages or facials with mom			0
there 's an old - fashioned two - lane bowling alley , tennis courts and a stocked pond ( yes , they even supply reels and bait ) , an ice cream parlor and game room equipped with everything from fooseball to pool to @entity301			1
make s'mores every night in front of an outdoor fireplace , watch movies in the theater downstairs or just stargaze			0
parents will appreciate that the @entity264 also offers complimentary organized activities for kids as young as three and this summer @entity264 has expanded its activities to outdoor programs for tweens and young teens			2
how about learning orienteering with the @entity34 as your playground ? " it may be touristy , " laughed @entity115			0
but then she gestures across the spectacular lake , with @entity321 in the distance			0
" there are plenty of places to get away from the crowds			0
" with the kids -- and your dog , of course			1
