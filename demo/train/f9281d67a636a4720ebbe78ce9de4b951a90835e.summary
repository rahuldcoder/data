@entity0 -- the suicide bomber who killed seven @entity4 officers and contractors and a @entity7 intelligence official in @entity8 was within seconds of being searched by two security contractors when he detonated his explosives , a former intelligence official with knowledge of the incident told @entity1 on tuesday			1
on december 30 , the two @entity18 guards , who worked for @entity16 -- formerly @entity16 -- approached the passenger side of the red 4 - door sedan where bomber @entity21 was sitting , the official said			2
@entity22 had been invited to the base to share information he claimed to have that would lead the @entity18 directly to @entity27 , @entity29 's second in command			1
the sedan was waved through the normal security checkpoints to get onto the base , and pulled up just outside a one - story building -- a temporary space that was being used to interrogate people brought onto base			2
several @entity4 officers and contractors were standing on the driver 's side of the car , opposite @entity44 , and others were standing as far as 50 feet away , a @entity18 intelligence official said			1
@entity22 started to get out of the car , with one hand in his pocket , when he detonated the explosives , the source said			1
" it was no accident that some of the @entity4 officers were standing on the opposite side , " the former intelligence official said			1
the official observed it was the safest place to be , as " they waited for the @entity16 guys to do what they 're paid to do and frisk him			0
" also , there could have been some cultural sensitivity , with an @entity65 man about to be searched in front of female @entity4 officers who were there			1
the official says that " there was no point going up to him until after the guards had patted him down			0
" some of these details were first reported in the @entity76 earlier this week			0
the official expressed surprise at how much shrapnel tore through the area , killing seven @entity4 officers and contractors -- including the two @entity16 guards -- as well as a @entity7 intelligence official			1
former @entity4 agent @entity85 told @entity1 that frequently , suicide bombers ' explosive vests are wrapped in " things like nuts and bolts and ball bearings			2
" so what you create is this massive amount of shrapnel that kills everybody in the entire area , " he said			0
@entity85 , who just returned from @entity8 , said it was unusual to have so many officers present for a debriefing , but if they believed @entity44 's claims that he had direct links to @entity29 's top leadership , the excitement on the base would have been high			1
" remember , this is a career opportunity for all of these people			0
if you could take down @entity27 , if you could take down @entity108 , you are a hero for the rest of your career			0
everybody wants to be in the room , " @entity85 said			0
@entity22 , a @entity7 doctor , was a promising potential source			0
@entity18 and @entity7 intelligence agencies apparently believed he was a reformed extremist and were using him to hunt @entity27			0
@entity22 had provided photographic evidence that helped establish his credibility , a @entity18 intelligence official said			1
there were other things that also helped determine his authenticity , the official added , but would provide no further details			0
the former intelligence official who spoke anonymously has been to @entity127 , where the attack occurred , and said body armor was worn even within the base 's inner perimeter , which is unusual , compared with military bases in @entity133 or @entity134			1
" you have a real sense of the proximity to the @entity139 border			0
perimeters do n't have the same meaning , " the official said			0
while saying that a mistake was made by not searching @entity44 before he got into the red car , the official defended the officers ' decision to bring him on base			1
" there 's nowhere to frisk someone outside , and you do n't have a whole lot of options			0
let 's assume they did have a safe house -- the exact same thing would have happened there , " the official said			2
in a rare public defense of the @entity4 officers ' actions , cia director @entity160 said the officers did not ignore the potential dangers because of the potential for valuable information			1
" this was not a question of trusting a potential intelligence asset , even one who had provided information that we could verify independently			2
it is never that simple , and no one ignored the hazards , " @entity160 wrote in an op - ed this weekend in the @entity76			0
" the individual was about to be searched by our security officers -- a distance away from other intelligence personnel -- when he set off his explosives			1
" the official says the attack not only sheds light on the dangerous work @entity4 officials and contractors do in @entity8 , but how their footprint is growing			1
@entity127 was used to conduct operations back and forth across the @entity139 border			0
but the official says it is just " one of many bases in @entity8 " that operate outside @entity18 military or @entity198 command			1
@entity8 contractors guard the outer perimeter of many of the bases			2
" back in 2005 , the @entity4 worked up an entire plan on how to increase its presence in @entity8 , " the official said			1
this effort was pursued " very aggressively " through the last several years of the @entity207 administration , and the official believed president @entity209 would have been briefed on that when he took office			0
the official says the feeling in the intelligence community is that @entity209 has increased the frequency and intensity of aggressive actions around the @entity8 / @entity139 border region			1
since he took office , the @entity18 has ramped up the use of pilotless drones to strike at @entity29 targets in @entity139 , including at least seven strikes since the december 30 attack at @entity127 , and approximately 51 others previously in 2009			2
in 2008 , the last year of president @entity207 's administration , there were approximately 34 drone strikes			0
" i 've seen no evidence that he 's [ @entity209 ] diminished in any way the strategy of the previous administration			2
in fact , president @entity209 has not only continued what president @entity207 started , he 's built on it , " the official said			2
@entity1 intelligence producer @entity240 and @entity242 supervising producer @entity241 contributed to this report .			0
