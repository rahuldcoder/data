@entity9 , 2 , has been missing since june in a case that has received national attention			2
at a news conference , capt. @entity15 , an @entity16 commander , said investigators are looking into whether the tips , called in august 11 , 12 and 13 , were properly followed up			1

on august 13 , a deputy responded to the site and did a " cursory search " but found nothing , @entity20 said			1
@entity9 , 22 , faces charges including first - degree murder in the june disappearance of her daughter , @entity9 , who was 2 at the time			2
remains described as being those of a small child were found last week a half - mile from @entity9 's parents ' home , in the area where the meter reader first directed police			1
@entity20 said police were getting more information from the tipster and the deputy who responded to the tips			2
he said the department was investigating the " thoroughness " of the deputy 's response but would not identify the deputy			0
the meter reader " is not a suspect , " @entity20 said			0
" he is a credible witness			0
" @entity58 ' latest announcement is raising questions about whether police missed several chances to find remains believed to be @entity9 's			1
the meter reader is not the only one , or the first , to have pointed police toward the site containing the remains			2
@entity68 , @entity9 's childhood friend , also told police to investigate the same wooded area near @entity71 a month before the meter reader , according to @entity2 affiliate @entity73			1
in an interview with detectives , according to @entity73 , @entity68 said that she and @entity80 " pretty much used to hang out there most of our time , " would " snack on food for hours " and went there to " get away from our parents			2

authorities have said the remains are believed to be @entity9 's , but an identification is pending			1
@entity118 's spokesman @entity117 said last week that authorities believe the remains are @entity9 's for three reasons : no other children have been reported missing in the area ; the remains are consistent with those of a child of @entity9 's age ; and the remains were found near the home of the grandparents , where the 2 - year - old and her mother were living just before @entity9 disappeared			1
