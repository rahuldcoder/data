@entity1 , @entity0 -- protesters in @entity0 , rowdy with revolutionary fervor , dug in for an 18th day of demonstrations friday , one day after @entity0 president @entity6 refused to step down			1
in a highly anticipated speech , @entity6 clung to the presidency but said he would " delegate powers " to vice president @entity10 according to the constitution -- a major concession from the man who has ruled @entity0 with an iron grip for 30 years			1
his speech , however , enraged protesters in @entity17 , who want @entity6 to leave now			1
packed in like sardines and showing no sign of giving up , many said they were spending the night in the square for the first time since the protests began			0
the mood of the crowd was relentlessly upbeat , even at 3 a.m.			0
a splinter group of demonstrators marched to the presidential palace , where the military maintains a strong presence			1
another group rallied in front of a state television building			1
massive street demonstrations are expected on friday			1
" get out ! get out ! " angry protesters chanted as @entity6 spoke			1
after the the president 's speech , parliamentary speaker @entity37 told state - run @entity40 that @entity6 's move had put the authority for the day - to - day running of the government in @entity10 's hands			1
that would include oversight of the police , the @entity48 and other key agencies , control of economic policy and running any negotiations with the opposition			0
@entity37 echoed @entity6 's statement in adding that the constitution specifically prohibits the president from delegating other key powers to the vice president			1
as a result , the power to dismiss parliament or dismiss the government and the power to ask for amendments to the constitution remain in @entity6 's hands , not @entity10 's			1
" the vice president is the de facto president , " @entity0 's ambassador to the @entity68 , @entity67 , told @entity2 , shortly after @entity6 spoke			1
protesters watched @entity6 's speech on screens hoisted above their heads in @entity17			1
quiet at first , they waited to hear what he would say			0
when it became clear the president would not stand down , they erupted			2
" illegitimate ! " they cried			0
" @entity6 , the coward , must stand down ! " " everyone 's lost , " @entity78 , a demonstrator in the square and star of the motion picture " @entity81 , " said after the president 's speech			1
" people are trying to work out what more they can do			0
" @entity6 stressed -- as he has before -- that he would not run for another term in september			1
he also expressed regret for any loss of life and said he would move to repeal @entity91 179 of the @entity0 constitution , which allows @entity6 to send anyone suspected of terrorism to a military court , " as soon as we regain stability and security			1
" his comments came as pressure on @entity6 's regime intensified throughout the day			1
rumors had run rampant before he spoke that @entity6 was planning to step down			1
many also had predicted he would deputize @entity10 , the former intelligence chief , to take control			0
for that to happen under the current constitution , @entity6 must retain the title of president -- as he did			1
@entity10 addressed the nation soon after @entity6 , urging @entity0 to remain calm and go back to work			1
he said he was committed to doing " whatever it takes in order to have an orderly transition of powers in accordance with the provisions of the constitution			2
" " go back to your houses			0
go back to your work			0
the homeland needs your work , " @entity10 said			0
@entity6 's refusal to step down caught the administration of @entity68 president @entity125 off guard , a senior @entity68 official told @entity2			1
" not what we were told would happen and not what we wanted to happen , " the official , who would speak only on the condition of anonymity , said of the speech			2
@entity125 released a statement late thursday , calling on the @entity0 government to do more			1
" the @entity0 people have been told that there was a transition of authority , but it is not yet clear that this transition is immediate , meaningful or sufficient , " he said			0
" too many @entity0 remain unconvinced that the government is serious about a genuine transition to democracy , and it is the responsibility of the government to speak clearly to the @entity0 people and the world			0
" the mass demonstrations , despite stern government warnings of military intervention , were relentless thursday , and thousands of workers in vital industries walked off their jobs in a show of solidarity with demonstrators demanding change			2
in their strongest maneuver yet , the military 's senior officers thursday issued " @entity164 , " as if more were forthcoming , stating that their discussions were ongoing on " what can be achieved to preserve the homeland and the gains of the @entity0 people			2
" the military remained out in force throughout the day , and many believe @entity0 's future hinges on the role it will play			2
@entity174 must save the country now , " @entity171 , an opposition leader , posted on his @entity173 page soon after @entity6 spoke			1
similarly , @entity176 , one of the organizers of protests in @entity179 , said the military must intervene and push to get @entity6 out			1
" everyone in @entity0 is disappointed ... we were hoping that it was almost over , but we will continue until the whole regime gets toppled , " he said			0
exactly what role the military will play , however , remained unclear			0
" this now creates a massive crisis for the @entity0 military , " analysts with @entity194 global intelligence company said in a statement , soon after @entity6 's speech			1
" as dawn breaks over @entity1 , it is likely that large numbers of others will join the demonstrators and that the crowd might begin to move			0
the military would then be forced to stand back and let events go where they go , or fire on the demonstrators , " the analysts said			0
earlier thursday , protesting lawyers toppled barricades near @entity206 , the former home of @entity0 's monarchy and a symbol of power			2
armed police , who had disappeared from the streets of @entity1 as the uprising gained momentum , waited behind metal fences			0
but the police fled and the crowd surged amid the roar of thunder on a rainy day			0
" @entity220 is great , " they chanted			0
unable to enter the palace , which was under heavy army protection , the group of lawyers headed to @entity17 , where massive crowds again gathered to call for the immediate departure of @entity6			1
the demonstrations were galvanized earlier in the week by the words and tears of freed cyberactivist @entity230 , who emerged as a reluctant hero of @entity0 's uprising			1
@entity230 , on leave from his marketing job with the search engine @entity233 in @entity234 , was seized by security forces and held for 10 days before being released			0
he is credited with starting a @entity241 page that triggered the protests			0
@entity6 's foes were re-energized again thursday by strikes called by petroleum , railway and telecommunications employees seeking better compensation			1
oil workers demanded transparency in executive salaries , said @entity252 , a spokesman for the petroleum ministry			0
@entity255 employees called for longer contracts , prompting a pledge to extend them from their leaders			0
some did not return to work thursday , said @entity260 , head of the @entity255			0
employees of the steel industry and the @entity263 also took to the streets to demand better salaries , said the state - run @entity267 newspaper			2
that sparked fears that the @entity263 -- a significant oil transport hub and major revenue source for @entity0 -- would shut down and send oil prices skyrocketing			0
@entity0 's finance minister said the nation will " do its utmost best " to ensure the canal remains open			2
" all precautions are taken to prevent any sabotage from outside to the @entity263 , " @entity278 told @entity2			0
" the @entity263 is safe and the @entity174 -- i do n't talk on their behalf -- but i can assure you it will do whatever is in its power to keep that open			0
" in the @entity293 city of @entity179 , @entity0 's second largest , street cleaners and administrative staff went on strike over what they say is a salary freeze			2
at least 1,000 engineers protested contracts and financial compensations , officials said			0
thursday 's demonstrations unfolded with vigor despite escalating fears of a government crackdown			2
key government officials have sought to portray an immediate departure for @entity6 as a recipe for absolute mayhem and warned of military intervention			2
@entity311 has been deeply critical of the government 's handling of the crisis			2
" @entity6 's speech is far from the needed break with the abusive system of the past 30 years , " @entity315 , executive director of @entity311 , said in a statement thursday			1
" cosmetic changes are not enough to meet the @entity0 people 's demands for democracy and human rights			2
" the monitoring group has documented 302 deaths since the january 25 rally that ignited @entity0 's revolt			2
@entity2 's @entity329 , @entity330 , @entity331 and @entity332 and journalist @entity333 contributed to this report			0
