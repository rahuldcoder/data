@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity6 , one of the world 's largest food companies , has reopened its factory in @entity1 after receiving assurances from the government that its business will not be interfered with again , an official with the @entity5 - based company said tuesday			1
the company shut its @entity0 factory last month , complaining of harassment by authorities after it refused to take milk supplies from a farm that had been taken over by president @entity20 's family as part of his controversial land reform program			1
" on the basis of the written assurances given by the @entity28 of @entity1 to guarantee the security of @entity6 management and staff and not to interfere in the company 's operating processes , @entity6 decided to restart the activities at its @entity0 factory , " said @entity23 with @entity25 's corporate communications department			1
" the company reiterates its commitment to source milk exclusively from its contracted farmers , " @entity36 's statement added			0
minister of industry and commerce of @entity1 , @entity42 , confirmed that he held meetings with @entity6 management			2
" i was assigned by my superiors to have meetings with them , and i assured them that their concerns will be addressed			0
we can not afford to lose investors at this stage when we are rebuilding the economy , " @entity42 said			0
the @entity6 shutdown was seen by many as a setback to the country 's efforts to attract foreign investors to help shore up its battered economy			2
operations were under way as normal at the @entity6 plant in @entity0 on tuesday			2
@entity6 said last month its decision to shut the facility was prompted by an unannounced visit from government officials and police december 19 , after which the firm was forced to accept a milk delivery from non-contracted suppliers			1
two of its managers , including expatriate managing director @entity72 , were questioned by police and released without charge the same day			0
@entity23 said @entity6 had been in @entity1 for 50 years and employs more than 200 people in the southern @entity77 nation , adding that the company was " working with the population of @entity1 and striving to maintain a long - term viable operation in often challenging conditions			1
" we operate in @entity1 , as we do in every country , through good times and bad			0
we work for the long - term , in a way which has positive impact on our consumers , employees and suppliers , " @entity23 said			0
@entity6 stopped buying milk from @entity92 , owned by @entity20 's family , in october , following international criticism of a deal it had agreed to earlier in the year to use the farm as a supplier			1
the farm had been seized under @entity20 's controversial land reform program , which targets mainly the properties of white farmers			1
critics say @entity20 's seizure of white - owned commercial farms to resettle landless black @entity1 -- who have no farming experience -- has ruined the country 's once - prosperous economy			0
@entity20 , in power since independence from @entity110 in 1980 , denies the charge , and says the economic crisis is due to sanctions imposed by @entity116 nations in response to his land reform .			0
