-- @entity1 is a week away , but it 's hard to focus on the annual feast with all the ads for @entity6 sales and the @entity8 decorations that have popped up everywhere in the past few weeks			1
everywhere , that is , except @entity10			2
the department store is continuing its tradition of closing on @entity13 , even as retail giants like @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 plan to open that evening and @entity19 's doors will open at 6 on @entity1 morning			1
you also wo n't see any @entity8 decorations or hear any carols in @entity10 stores until after @entity1			2
" we wo n't be decking our halls until friday , november 29			0
why ? we just like the idea of celebrating one holiday at a time , " the signs outside the stores read			0
the store has been posting these signs for at least 20 years , judging by news reports dating back to 1992			0
and it apparently never gets old			0
@entity0 affiliate @entity34 in @entity35 , @entity36 , posted the sign on its @entity39 page on wednesday and invited followers to " share if you agree			0
" commenters mostly supported @entity10 's decision , saying , " @entity1 is a time to share with your family , " and praising the store for " going against the grain			1
" others pointed out that some @entity10 employees would still have to work on @entity1 to decorate the store and get ready for the @entity6 sales			1
