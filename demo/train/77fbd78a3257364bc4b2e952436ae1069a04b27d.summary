speculation continues to swirl around the potential involvement of violent video games in @entity4 's rampage at @entity5 in december			1
the official investigation has yet to release its report , but consistent accounts indicate @entity4 was an enthusiastic player of violent games			1
on monday , @entity10 raised eyebrows with a report citing unnamed law enforcement sources conjecturing that @entity4 was motivated in part by violent video games as well as @entity18 shooter @entity16			1
the investigating @entity20 police later said that 's " all speculation			0
" according to the @entity24 , we know that when the police searched @entity4 's home after the shooting , they found thousands of dollars ' worth of violent video games			1
we also know that @entity4 's mom let him play games while she traveled			2
news : report -- @entity5 shooter tried to emulate @entity18 massacre but just because violent video games seemed to have been a part of @entity4 's life , as with many young men , we can not jump to conclusions			1
the reality is that there is no evidence linking violent games to mass shootings			1
we tend to return to this particular element , and it 's interesting to see how quickly people like to latch on to this noncorrelation as if it were truly meaningful			2
the notion that mass homicides are linked to violent media was debunked as far back as 2002 by the @entity50 , which found that school shooters did n't consume high levels of violent media			1
but as a society we tend to focus on video games because it 's easy to do so			1
for example , in the recent case of @entity58 , a 15 - year - old boy accused of killing his family in @entity60 , the police seemed to have been obsessed with violent games during a press conference			2
the police representative shifted a reporter 's question about illegal drugs to video games , the gist of which seemed to be that the boy enjoyed talking about " @entity72			2
" however , other reports suggested the boy 's access to violent games or television had been restricted by his family			2
in the weeks since the @entity5 , @entity20 , massacre , there have been a host of high - profile crimes committed by older men			0
@entity83 , 62 , shot and killed two firefighters and apparently killed his sister in @entity86			0
@entity87 , 65 , killed a bus driver and kidnapped a 5 - year - old boy in @entity90			0
and @entity92 , 70 , killed two people at a @entity95 law office , police said			0
these older men do n't fit the profile of video game players , yet they all did something horrible			2
@entity99 : do n't blame the video games curiously , no one seems interested in investigating the effects of media popular among the elderly			1
our attention to video games in the cases of some shootings but not others is what psychologists call confirmation bias , and it creates the illusion of a correlation where there is none			1
it 's worth asking ourselves why we keep returning to video games despite the lack of evidence to support its link to violence			1
of course , this kind of association is not new			0
some scholars blamed television for the crime wave of the 1970s and ' 80s , which has since vanished			0
and comic books in the 1950s were blamed by psychiatrists for not only delinquency but homosexuality ( @entity135 were secretly gay it seemed			0
i 'm not making this up )			0
in hindsight , these strands of associations look ridiculous , but in the moment they served a purpose			0
opinion : @entity146 's video game smacks of hypocrisy rare though they are , mass shootings often strike at schools , malls , churches , theaters -- places we all go in places we all live			1
one of the questions asked repeatedly after the @entity5 shooting is why @entity4 did what he did			2
to say that he was an evil young man who cruelly inflicted suffering on others simply because , in his mind , life had given him the shaft is not satisfying			0
we want to control the uncontrollable , predict the unpredictable			0
we want to understand why an impossible to understand event happened and give ourselves some illusion of control			0
if violent video games were some small but critical component of @entity4 's motivation , why we could just get rid of such games and make this whole problem go away			1
it 's a tempting belief but absolutely wrong			0
tech : after @entity5 , shoppers think twice about violent video games if we could make it legal to regulate violence in games , would that have stopped @entity4 or any of the other mass homicides through history ? no , not a one			1
we should not be distracted from looking for the real contributing factors to societal violence .			0

consistent accounts indicate that @entity4 played a lot of violent video games
@entity187 : there is no evidence linking video games to mass shootings
he says people tend to see an illusion of correlation when there is none
@entity187 : even if we can regulate violence in games , it would n't stop mass shooters
