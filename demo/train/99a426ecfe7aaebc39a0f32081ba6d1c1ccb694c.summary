-- a @entity2 phishing attack is on the loose this weekend -- the third widespread attack on the site in the past three weeks			2
the attack attempts to steal your @entity2 login credentials , install malware on your computer , and even get your home address			1
the attack is spread via a " hilarious video " posted to @entity2 walls , reports @entity13 -- when clicked , a form appears requesting your @entity2 login			1
the attack then returns you to @entity2 , installs an app called " @entity16 , " and asks you to download the " @entity18 player " -- doing so installs malware on your machine			0
it gets worse : depending on your location , you may also be presented with a contest to win an @entity24 ... if you just enter your home address			0
to avoid getting caught , simply remove the " hilarious video " if you find it on your @entity2 wall			1
if you see it elsewhere on @entity2 , do n't click it ... and of course remember the obvious rule : do n't enter your @entity2 login anywhere other than @entity2			0
if you already fell for the attack , change your @entity2 password , uninstall the @entity2 app ( often called " @entity16 " ) , and run a virus / malware scan on your computer			2
