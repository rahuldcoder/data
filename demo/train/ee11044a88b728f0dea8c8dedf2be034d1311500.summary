-- recently , i discovered that one of my best friends had ditched me after i logged onto @entity4 and found her profile had disappeared from my page			1
when you break up with a best friend online , things can get murky			1
we 'd been having problems that had culminated in a huge argument the day before , but i figured we 'd get through it			2
still , being given the heave - ho by way of a social networking site ? my first reaction was to laugh			2
i mean , we 're adults			2
unfriending me seemed tantamount to toilet - papering my locker or scribbling my phone number on the boy 's locker room wall			1
we had been close for well over a decade			2
we supported each other through parental deaths , and together we 'd bitched and moaned about men for untold hours			0
i loved her amazing daughter -- buying that little girl @entity26 presents was the highlight of my holidays			1
suddenly , that was all gone			0
suddenly , i was n't laughing			1
we know what to do when boyfriends dump us : sob			0
we eat everything in the house or take to our beds and refuse all sustenance			0
usually , there 's yelling -- at least at my house			1
the @entity0 : how not to help heal a broken heart we purge them from our lives			0
we delete all their emails and erase their number from every electronic device we own			0
but when you break up with a girlfriend , things are murkier			0
for one thing , people do n't feel sorry for you the way they do when a romantic relationship bites the dust			1
you ca n't blame them ; it 's not like you were in love or planning a future with your friend			1
( even though you assumed she 'd be part of it			0
) so , getting wound up about the loss seems somehow , i do n't know , less legit			1
is it ? it hurts as much as any other heartbreak			0
@entity66 made a short film on the subject : " ruminations on @entity70			0
" i asked her about the process of grieving a dead friendship			0
" as a woman , i expect men to come and go because of the nature of love , " she explained			2
" but your girls are supposed to be on your side , no matter what ... that 's what i wanted to believe for a long time , but now i know that that 's not always reality			2
" the @entity0 : what are your rules for friendship on @entity4 ? a friend of mine was saddened when her bff excised my friend from her life after landing a boyfriend			1
" she hated being single , so if there was a man anywhere in the vicinity , you 'd be kicked to the curb , " my pal explained wistfully			0
even forewarned with this knowledge , it stung when she was dismissed from her friend 's life			1
the @entity0 : five ways to unfriend a friend unlike my breakup , there was no dramatic defriending			1
this woman utilized the passive - aggressive method of choice : the slow fade			0
" i remember buying her a birthday gift , but somehow she just never had the time to come collect it			0
" the @entity0 : ten songs about friendship like any other kind of relationship , friendships end			1
it 's not like i 've never dumped a pal			2
i 've gotten back together with a few			0
because i miss her and love her , i gave making up a shot with this one			2
a few weeks after i was banished from her @entity4 page , i emailed her an apologetic note			1

*author* gets ditched on @entity4 by good friend and does n't know what to do
people do n't feel as sorry for you with a friend breakup
you ca n't blame your friend -- it 's not like you were in love
like any other kind of relationship , friendships end but you have to go on
