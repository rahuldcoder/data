obesity shaves two to four years off the average lifespan , while being very obese can shorten your lifespan by 8 to 10 years , according to a new analysis of 57 studies including nearly 900,000 people			1
men and women with @entity9 between 22.5 and 25 were the least likely to die during the study 's follow - up period			2
" this is scary and something that we should pay close attention to , " says @entity12 , @entity13 , a professor of global health at the @entity16 at the @entity17 in @entity18			0
the new findings actually underestimate the true impact of obesity on society because they do n't address the costs of obesity - related illness and other factors , says @entity12 , who was not involved with the current study			1
the study , published online march 18 in the journal @entity34 , was conducted in part by the eminent epidemiologist sir @entity36 of the @entity37			0
@entity36 and his colleagues in the @entity39 , a team of dozens of researchers from around the world , say they did the new study to figure out exactly how body mass index ( @entity44 ) relates to mortality			1
researchers also investigated how smoking influenced this relationship and how excess weight affected death risk from specific causes			0
their analysis included 894,576 people , mostly from @entity53 and @entity54			0
most were age 46 when the study started and were recruited in 1979 ; the average @entity44 for all participants was 25			1
the researchers eliminated deaths during the first five years of their analysis to avoid including people who were excessively thin because of illness			2
a @entity44 of 18.5 to 24.9 is normal ( that translates to weighing between 114 and 149 pounds if you 're 5 feet 5 inches tall ) ; overweight is 25 to 29.9 ( 150 to 179 pounds if you 're 5 feet 5 inches tall ) ; and obese is 30 or more ( 180 pounds - plus on a 5 - foot - 5 - inch frame			1
) you can figure out your @entity44 at the @entity66 web site			2
men and women in the new analysis who had bmis between 22.5 and 25 were the least likely to die during the follow - up period , which averaged eight years			0
but every additional 5 @entity44 points boosted mortality risk by 30 percent			2
the increase was strongest for deaths due to cardiovascular disease , diabetes , kidney , and liver disease ; cancer deaths also went up with increasing @entity44 , but not as much as other diseases			1
@entity83 : how to find your healthiest body mass index people with bmis below 22.5 had a higher mortality risk during the study than those who weighed slightly more , largely because of respiratory illnesses , such as lung cancer			1
the researchers say this is probably the result of skinny people who were smokers			0
the researchers calculate that having a @entity44 of 30 to 35 takes to two to four years off the average lifespan compared with having a @entity44 of 22.5 to 25			2
having a @entity44 between 40 and 45 ( for example , being 5 feet 5 ' and weighing 240 to 270 pounds ) , they say , reduces one 's lifespan by eight to 10 years			1
this reduction in lifespan is on par with being a heavy smoker			0
@entity83 : dietary fats can help -- or harm -- your heart this is n't too far out of line with research conducted by @entity109 , @entity13 , a senior research scientist and distinguished consultant with the @entity112 's @entity111			0
in a 2005 study , @entity113 and her team reported that while being obese ( having a @entity44 of 30 or above ) shortened lifespan , those who were overweight ( a @entity44 of 25 to 29.9 ) were at no greater risk of death , and may actually have had a lower mortality rate in a given time period than their normal - weight peers			1
@entity83 : how to cut up to 900 calories with simple substitutions while the study kicked up a lot of controversy -- some people thought the findings minimized the health effects of excess weight -- several other studies have also found no greater mortality risk associated with being overweight ( but not obese ) , and possibly lower mortality , @entity109 notes			1
given the difficulty of losing weight , the authors of the new study say , it may be best if people are motivated to prevent the weight gain in the first place			0
for example , a person who held their @entity44 steady at 28 rather than going up to 32 ( typical of the increase seen in middle age ) could extend their life by two years , the researchers say , while a young adult who maintained a @entity44 of 24 rather than going up to 32 could add three years to his lifespan			1
@entity83 : @entity44 success story : how one woman lost 44 pounds for this to happen here , @entity12 notes , the @entity155 government is going to have to do a much better job of supporting prevention efforts			0
a " bailout " for such efforts that translated to healthier @entity155 and workers could be a pretty effective economic stimulus , he added			0
try a free trial issue of @entity165 ! @entity166 2009			0

study : obesity shortens life by 2 - 4 years ; the very obese could lose up to 10 years
higher mortality because of diabetes , cardiovascular , kidney and liver disease
cancer deaths also went up with increasing @entity44 , but not as much as other diseases
another study had found that being overweight , but not obese , did n't shorten life
