-- veteran striker @entity1 equaled the @entity3 scoring record of @entity5 great @entity4 to rescue a point for @entity7 in a pulsating 2 - 2 draw with @entity9 in @entity10 saturday			1
the 36 - year - old had only just come off the bench when he reacted quickly to a flicked header by @entity14 from a @entity16 corner to grab the equalizer in the @entity19 game			2
it was his 15th goal in the world 's biggest sporting event , breaking the @entity24 record he had held with @entity26			0
@entity1 also became only the third man to score in four @entity3 finals tournaments , along with @entity29 and fellow @entity24 @entity30			2
he screwed a late chance wide , but a win for the @entity19 leaders would have been harsh on @entity9 , who gave them an almighty scare			1
the @entity9 had the better of the first half and only two fine saves by @entity39 denied @entity40 and @entity41			0
@entity7 started the second half brighter and @entity43 headed the opening goal -- which deflected in off his own knee -- in the 51st minute after a pin point cross from @entity48			0
@entity9 , so disappointing in its opening defeat to the @entity50 , equalized almost immediately as @entity51 jumped to head home his second goal of the tournament			0
just after the hour mark , @entity40 picked out @entity55 , who raced through to beat @entity39 with a fine finish			0
it was his fifth goal in @entity3 finals , equaling the @entity60 record held by the great @entity61 of @entity62			2
@entity9 substitute @entity63 might have put the game beyond @entity7 's reach but he opted for goal rather than passing to the unmarked @entity55			1
it proved a vital moment and almost inevitably @entity7 drew level with @entity1 's close - range strike in the 70th minute to leave @entity72 's team with four points after two games and set for qualification to the last 16			1
" it does n't matter whether i play from the start or come off the bench : all games are important and 15 goals in 20 @entity3 games is n't bad , " said @entity1 , who plays for @entity77 club @entity76			1
he took another of @entity26 's records for @entity7 's all - time leading scorer when he grabbed his 69th goal in a 6 - 1 thrashing of @entity89 in a @entity3 warmup game earlier this month			1
@entity26 scored 68 in just 62 games , his final goal for his country being the winner in the 1974 @entity3 final against the @entity96			0
@entity9 , quarterfinalist in 2010 , will go into its final group match knowing victory against @entity100 will be needed to have a chance of progressing further			0
but midfielder @entity102 said it had been the right result after one of the best matches of a tournament full of incident - packed games			0
" it went backwards and forwards , @entity7 could have won it , we could have won it -- the point was fair , " said @entity102 , who plays for @entity24 club @entity107 and represented the country 's under - 21 team before choosing the nation of his father			2
@entity102 's half - brother @entity115 was in the @entity7 side , only the second time in @entity3 history this has occurred .			1

@entity7 held 2 - 2 by @entity9 in @entity19
@entity1 scores late equalizer for @entity7
@entity1 equals @entity3 scoring record of 15
@entity55 had put @entity9 2 - 1 ahead
