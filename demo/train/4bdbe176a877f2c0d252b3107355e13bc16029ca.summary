" obviously this is a matter for the @entity1 judicial system , " @entity12 told reporters at the @entity14			2
" we 're going to continue to provide support as we do in every instance like this to @entity4 citizens who have been charged and hope that this matter can be resolved in an expeditious way , but it is something that a sovereign nation is pursuing based on the evidence that it presented when the charges were announced			1
" @entity12 said the @entity4 @entity26 in @entity1 is providing consular services and the @entity4 ambassador is speaking with his counterparts in the @entity1 government			1
" we have full access " to the @entity4 , she said			2
a judge has not ruled on the missionaries ' petition for bail , said their attorney , @entity37			1

@entity1 authorities split up the group , which was being held in a city jail , on friday , @entity37 said			1

the @entity4 have said they were just trying to help the children leave the earthquake - stricken country			1
some of the detained @entity4 have said they thought they were helping orphans , but their interpreters told @entity2 this week that they were present when group members spoke with some of the children 's parents			1
some parents in a village outside @entity0 said they had willingly given their children over to the @entity4 , who promised them a better life , and who said the parents could see their children whenever they wanted to			1
@entity37 said he felt @entity44 , who was leading the missionary group , was responsible for the situation			1
" let me tell you my personal impression , " @entity37 said friday , " the nine other people are victims			0

" we hope that he will decide long before those three months , " he said			0
" he can release them , he can ask to prosecute them			0
" if a decision is made to prosecute , the case would be heard before a jury , he said			0
@entity111 told @entity2 the @entity1 government was open to the possibility of the case being transferred to a @entity4 court , but said the request would have to come from the @entity4			1
" until now , i was not asked , " he said			0
in @entity128 , @entity14 spokesman @entity127 confirmed that " we have not had any discussions with @entity1 officials about shifting prosecution to the @entity4			1
" " this is a @entity1 legal process			2
obviously the 10 @entity4 citizens have been charged under @entity1 law , " he said			1
" it would appear , based on the reporting that we 've seen , that they ... were attempting to move those children out of @entity1 without the authorization of the @entity1 government			2
we recognize that that is a potential violation of @entity1 law			2
the judge in this case has interviewed the @entity4 , he has evaluated the evidence that has been presented to him			2
" @entity4 officials are talking with @entity1 officials about how the cases will unfold , and the @entity4 will continue to monitor the situation closely , @entity127 said			1
former president @entity12 , the @entity151 envoy to @entity1 , said @entity1 leaders do n't want the issue to become a distraction to the recovery effort			2
" i think what 's important now is for the government of @entity1 and the government of the @entity4 to get together and work through this because the government of @entity1 understands that they 're not looking for some big fight here , " @entity12 said friday			1
" they just want to protect their children			0
" he added , " i think they will find a way to defuse the crisis and work through this			0
" government approval is needed for any @entity1 child to leave the country , and the group acknowledged that the children had no passports			1
