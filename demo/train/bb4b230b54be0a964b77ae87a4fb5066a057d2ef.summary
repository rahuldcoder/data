-- like a lot of people , @entity1 began using @entity4 more than four years ago to keep in touch with friends who were n't in college			1
our real - world friendships are often a reflection of who we connect with online , experts say			2
but soon she felt too old for the social - networking site , and the customizable pages with music that were fun at first began to annoy her			2
by the time she graduated from the @entity19 , @entity1 ' classmates were n't on @entity4 -- they were on @entity21			2
throughout graduate school and beyond , as her network began to expand , @entity1 ceased using @entity4 altogether			0
@entity21 had come to represent the whole of her social and professional universe			2
" @entity4 has one population , @entity21 has another , " said the 26 - year - old , who works for an affordable - housing nonprofit in @entity29 , @entity30			1
" blue - collar , part - time workers might like the appeal of @entity4 more -- it definitely depends on who you meet and what they use ; that 's what motivates people to join and stay interested			2
" is there a class divide online ? research suggests yes			0
a recent study by market research firm @entity45 found that people in more affluent demographics are 25 percent more likely to be found friending on @entity21 , while the less affluent are 37 percent more likely to connect on @entity4			1
more specifically , almost 23 percent of @entity21 users earn more than $ 100,000 a year , compared to slightly more than 16 percent of @entity4 users			1
on the other end of the spectrum , 37 percent of @entity4 members earn less than $ 50,000 annually , compared with about 28 percent of @entity21 users			1
@entity4 users tend to be " in middle - class , blue - collar neighborhoods , " said @entity55 , vice president of data product management for @entity45 , which used an online panel of more than 200,000 social media users in the @entity60 in august			1
" they 're on their way up , or perhaps not college educated			0
" by contrast , @entity55 said , " @entity21 [ use ] goes off the charts in the upscale suburbs , " driven by a demographic that for @entity45 is represented by white or @entity69 married couples between the ages of 45 - 64 with kids and high levels of education			1
even more affluent are users of @entity75 , the microblogging site , and @entity77 , a networking site geared to white - collar professionals			1
almost 38 percent of @entity77 users earn more than $ 100,000 a year			1
@entity81 also found a strong overlap between those who use @entity21 and those who use @entity77 , @entity55 said			1
@entity45 is n't the first to find this trend			0
@entity87 danah boyd , who does not capitalize her name , said she watched the class divide emerge while conducting research of @entity60 teens ' use of social networks in 2006			1
when she began , she noticed the high school students all used @entity4 , but by the end of the school year , they were switching to @entity21			1
when boyd asked why , the students replied with reasons similar to @entity1 : " the features were better ; @entity4 is dangerous and @entity21 is safe ; my friends are here , " boyd recalled			1
and then , boyd said , " a young woman , living in a small historical town in @entity107 said to me , ' i do n't mean to be a racist or anything , but @entity4 is like , ghetto			0
' " for boyd , that 's when it clicked			0
" it 's not a matter of choice between @entity21 and @entity4 , it was a movement to @entity21 from @entity4 , " she said , a movement that largely included the educated and the upper - class			1
so why do our online worlds , unencumbered by what separates us in daily life , reflect humans ' tendency to stick with what -- and who -- they know ? a lot of it has to do with the disparate beginnings of @entity4 and @entity21 , said @entity130 , editor - in - chief of @entity131 , a blog about social media			1
@entity21 originated at @entity134 and was limited at first to students at approved colleges before opening itself to the public in september 2006			2
@entity4 , on the other hand , had a " come one , come all " policy and made a mad dash towards monetization , @entity130 said			0
" they used a lot of banner ads without regard to the quality , and it really diminished the value [ of the site ] for the more tech - savvy demographic			0
" and while the @entity151 can build bridges between people on opposite sides of the globe , we still tend to connect with the same people through online social networks who we connect with offline , said technology writer and blogger @entity160			1
" it 's effectively a mirror to our real world , " she told @entity0			0
" social networks are the online version of what kids do after school			1
" these social - networking divides are worrisome to boyd , who wrote " @entity171 : @entity172 in @entity173			0
" instead of allowing us to cross the boundaries that exist in our everyday lives , these online class differences threaten to carry those boundaries into the future			1
" the social - network infrastructure is going to be a part of everything going forward , just like [ @entity184 ] search is , " boyd said			0
" the internet is not this great equalizer that rids us of the problems of the physical world -- the internet mirrors and magnifies them			0
the divisions that we have in everyday life are going to manifest themselves online			0
" @entity196 , a research science fellow with the @entity197 at @entity134 , examined the @entity21 profiles of a group of college students over four years and found that even within @entity21 , there 's evidence of self - segregation			1
multiracial students tended to have more @entity21 friends than students of other backgrounds and were often the sole connection between white and black circles , @entity204 said			1
nonetheless , @entity204 feels that social networks may one day help us overcome our instinct to associate with those who share our income level , education , or racial background			2
" i think it 's fair to say that the @entity184 has great potential to at least mitigate everyday tendencies towards self - segregation and social exclusion , " @entity204 said			0
" in some ways , [ @entity21 ] levels the playing field of friendship stratification			0
in the real world , you have very close friends and then there are those you just say " hi " to when you pass them on the street			0
" the playing field is a lot more level in that you can find yourself having a wall - to - wall exchange with just an acquaintance			0
if you pick up the unlikely friend , not of your race or income bracket , the network may [ help you ] establish a more active friendship than if you met them in real life			0
" but @entity4 's users still find something appealing about @entity4 that they do n't about @entity21 , and it may have nothing to do with class or race , blogger @entity249 said			1
" it 's not just the demographics that have people picking one over the other , " @entity249 said			0
" it also comes down to what activities you like			0
if you like music , you 'll still be on @entity4			0
if you 're more into applications , then you might go to @entity21 because you 're addicted to @entity259 or whatever			0
" in the end , boyd is n't as concerned about the reasons behind these divisions online as she is about the consequences of people only networking within their chosen social - media groups			2
" friendships and family relationships are socially divided ; people self - segregate to deal with racism sometimes , " she said			1
" okay , fine : we 've made a decision to self - segregate , but what happens when politicians go on @entity21 and think they 're reaching the whole public ? what happens when colleges only go on @entity21 to promote ? " when and if that does happen , @entity131 's @entity130 said , we 'll know perhaps we 've given social networks more credit than they 're worth			1
" when it comes to information , i do n't think social networks are the best source for that			2
the @entity151 is so open , " said @entity130 , who believes users would go beyond their networks to search out information online			2
if you 're looking to branch out of your social network box , your best option may be @entity75			0
@entity45 's survey did n't find a dominant social class on @entity75 as much as they found a geographical one : those who use @entity75 are more likely to live in an urban area where there 's greater access to wireless network coverage , @entity55 said			2
" the simplicity of @entity75 definitely creates less of a divide , because it 's not a relationship like it is on @entity4 or @entity21 , " @entity130 said			2
" if you live in the middle of nowhere or you live in a city , you can follow anyone about anything			0

a recent @entity45 study finds class differences between online social networks
wealthier people are more likely to use @entity21 ; the less affluent , @entity4
almost 38 percent of @entity77 users earn more than $ 100,000 a year
a researcher found that college students tended to self - segregate online
