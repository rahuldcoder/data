@entity0 -- maybe " @entity3 " had it right			0
a second batch of previously unreleased papers from the @entity7 presidency made public friday revealed a hard - boiled , politically cynical @entity9 mindset similar to the fictional @entity11 administration of the popular tv show that ran from 1999 - 2006			1
read , search the documents highlights from the @entity7 memos every decision appears based at least in part on a political calculus , and some of the unvarnished back - and - forth shows the human side of the president and other officials that almost always remains well - hidden from public view			1
legacy issues shortly after @entity7 won reelection in 1996 , @entity9 aide @entity25 drafted a 14 - page memo to begin identifying " legacy goals " for the president on major policy issues			1
for a policy to be considered , @entity25 wrote , it must be " important and @entity33 ... achievable ... memorable and identifiable			0
" among the legacy issues @entity25 suggested were " reforming education " and " restoring @entity38 's @entity37			0
" in a 1993 memo on a planned public hearing with then first lady @entity44 to push her proposed health care reforms , aides @entity39 and @entity41 wrote the event would protect the administration from accusations of being closed to outside opinion			0
" as we discussed , the primary goal for this two - day hearing would be to inoculate ourselves from charges that we are refusing to listen to all those groups out there that want input , " said the memo by @entity39 and @entity41			2
another part sounded prescient about the continuing health care debate in @entity38 almost four years after @entity59 became law			0
" some testifiers should be average people with horror stories , middle - class families worried about the future , and senior citizens , " the aides wrote			2
" these average people should testify during those periods when we believe more people will be watching			0
" tough talk other documents include details and transcriptions of planning meetings for @entity7 's @entity76 that put the full personality and vocabulary of the 42nd president on display			1
" ca n't say an ass - pocket full of money , can you ? " @entity7 asked when discussing how to describe the 1998 budget surplus in the upcoming speech , according to a memo by speechwriter @entity87			1
his staff also could talk tough , as shown by memos responding to a draft text of @entity7 's december 15 , 1994 , speech following disastrous mid-term elections for @entity93			1
in seeming unanimity , advisers called the draft too defensive , with one describing it as " mealy - mouthed			1
" " the president should n't whine			1
he should lead , " wrote @entity99 , while @entity100 noted that " one of the president 's problems right now is that too many people see him as lacking backbone , vacillating , being too eager to please and tell people what they want to hear			0
" " i think he needs to sound strong and @entity109 -- in touch certainly , with what happened on nov. 8 but not weak , " @entity100 wrote			0
the 55 documents totaling more than 4,000 pages released friday by the @entity114 were the second batch of @entity117 papers made public in recent weeks			1
presidential records and the @entity119 the confidential memos , notes and other papers were part of files that had been requested for public release over the years under the @entity126 , but were withheld by the @entity119 due to their sensitive nature			2
while the @entity129 established public ownership of @entity9 documents as far back as the @entity133 administration , it specified that documents pertaining to federal appointments as well as confidential correspondence between the president and his advisers could be withheld from the public for 12 years after a president leaves office			2
other documents that can be withheld include classified national security information , confidential business information and trade secrets , and unwarranted invasions of personal privacy			0
those types of documents were not part of friday 's release			0
a @entity44 2016 campaign could cost $ 1.7 billion ? @entity154 questions timing of @entity7 document release earlier : fighting the first health care war @entity1 's @entity157 , @entity158 , @entity159 , @entity160 , @entity161 , @entity162 , @entity163 , @entity164 and @entity165 contributed to this report .			2
