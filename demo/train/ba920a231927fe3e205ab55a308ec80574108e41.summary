-- i 've been in @entity3 's shoes			1
@entity3 is the 12 - year - old @entity4 boy whose misspelling of " emancipation " during a @entity8 episode on " @entity9 ! " took social media by storm			1
fans are sharply divided over whether the show should have accepted his @entity9 answer , even though he would have finished second regardless			1
but what we forget is that a young man 's honest mistake was broadcast to millions of people across the @entity20 and @entity21			1
no matter the age , realizing that your " blooper " will be seen by many can be very embarrassing			2
twelve years ago , it was me standing below the " hot lamps " of a tv studio , appearing on the @entity30 version of " @entity31			1
" it took dozens of phone tests over a two - year period to make my dream of being on a tv game show a reality , and it came crashing down in a matter of minutes			2
social media howls over 12 - year - old 's errant ' t ' on ' @entity9 ! ' i was defeated on a $ 500 question on collar stays -- those tiny strips used to keep a shirt collar flat			1
i always wore dress shirts with the collar buttoned down , so " collar stays " were foreign to me			2
not wanting to burn my third and final lifeline , i guessed and came up short			2
the first few days after that taping were rough			2
i struggled with sleep , replayed the game over and over in my head , and wondered whether all those years of trying to qualify were worth it			2
i even apologized to my family and " @entity56 " lifelines for letting them down			2
the episode finally aired , and i did n't bother watching it			2
the show broadcast around the time i headed to work , so i spent that period walking to the subway , knowing that when i got to the office , my co-workers would have watched the show			0
as i soon as i stepped into the office , my co-workers gave me a round of applause			0
they told me that they were proud that i got on the show , and that it did n't matter whether i won a million dollars or nothing at all			0
my boss dropped off one of his collar stays on my desk , with a note that " you 'll always remember			0
" for the next 30 minutes or so , everyone wanted to ask me about the " millionaire experience " : what was @entity30 like ? how long does it take to record a 60 - minute show ? etc. it turns out that no one was ashamed at my performance after all			1
they were just happy that a lifelong dream came true			0
bullying not as simple as good vs. evil when i got home that morning , there were two messages on my answering machine			0
the first was from a teen who wanted to remind me what collar stays were ( i expected at least one prank call of that level )			0
the second was from what sounded like an older woman who wanted to congratulate me for being a " good sport " and a " gracious loser			0
" she said that it had to be tough for me to relive an embarrassing moment all over , but incidents like those only make you stronger			0
social media was at its infancy in 2001 -- it was essentially e-mail and @entity115 message boards for me -- but i heard from others who sympathized with my plight			0
i was even told of a possible petition to get me back on " @entity31 " under the guise that the collar stays questions was " too hard for $ 500			1
" i asked that the petition drive not take place -- maybe the question was hard , but i lost fair and square			1
i eventually did return to " @entity31 " for a special series of shows honoring " zero dollar winners			1
" before the taping , i had to witness my infamous moment over and over again -- my first appearance was looped for editing on the big screen during a contestant run through			1
i did n't shy away this time			0
instead , i laughed and wondered out loud why " @entity137 " did n't get a hold of us first			0
@entity3 will bounce back , just like i did , but it will take some time			1
this young man got to do something that so many @entity20 would love to do , myself included : be a contestant on " @entity9 ! " that 's something i would put on my resume or college application , regardless of whether i won or lost			1
he left the show $ 2,000 richer than he started , and what 12 - year - old would n't want to have that much money to play with or save for school ? and i know that @entity3 ' family , friends and social media supporters have to be thrilled that he got a chance to compete on national television			1
as a father , i think it 's important for parents to keep telling a kid like @entity3 that , win or lose , you 're proud of his performance and excited that he took such a big chance			1
do n't play the blame game -- saying that @entity166 was " smug " and that " spelling rules are silly " wo n't solve anything			0
and most of all , tell him to take on the world with his head held high			0
@entity3 may have finished second on that show , but he is a winner just by stepping up to the " @entity9 ! " podium and playing the game			1
it takes a lot of courage to do what he did , and for that i salute him			0
