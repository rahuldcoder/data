" even though we were many @entity13 living in @entity31 , it was hard to find @entity13 meals in @entity0 at that time because we did not have a lot of tourists coming to @entity13 , " said @entity52			1
" in those years , you could find plenty of @entity14 and @entity15 specialties because many tourists were going there on vacation and then coming back to @entity31 , but @entity13 dishes were much harder to find			1
