so @entity0 has signed @entity1 for a new sitcom			1
the 76 - year - old comedian is slated to play the patriarch of a multigenerational family , @entity0 told @entity6 on wednesday			1
@entity1 to return to @entity0 in new sitcom a network representative did not elaborate on anything else involving the show			1
no doubt , @entity0 is hoping this version of @entity13 brings back memories of his eight - year run as the gruff but warmhearted dr. @entity16 on " @entity17 " -- and not the failed gumshoe of " @entity19 , " which lasted one season in 1994 - 95 , or the cranky retiree of " @entity1 " ( 1996 - 2000 ) , which started out strong but sank quickly in the ratings			1
the return of @entity1 coincides with other figures from the ' 80s and early ' 90s making their return to prime time in one way or another			1
@entity30 has been heading a clan on " the @entity32 " since september , and @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity35 are reuniting for a yogurt commercial to air during the @entity38			0
( no word on whether the @entity40 will be in tow			0
) " @entity43 " stars reunite for @entity38 but nostalgia and q scores -- those popularity measuring sticks marketers love so much -- only go so far			2
sure , @entity1 is a popular guy			1
people still have warm feelings about the comedian , even if it 's been ages since he was @entity53 's most popular pitchman			0
( do n't laugh -- the man 's in the @entity55			2
) and " @entity17 " was a landmark in tv sitcoms , not only showcasing a bright @entity59 - @entity59 family but leading the ratings for five straight years in the 1980s			1
@entity0 began more than a decade of dominance thanks to " @entity1 's " success			1
" @entity1 is always going to be welcomed into people 's homes because of nostalgia for the @entity69 , " says @entity63 , a communications professor at @entity64 in @entity65			1
the trick , however , is the show he 'll be placed in			0
" a famous name is itself no guarantee , " wrote @entity73 's @entity72 , observing that @entity30 's show has suffered because it 's depended too heavily on memories of the lead instead of making his show interesting			0
" @entity1 , like the @entity81 he once pitched , remains a beloved brand			1
but if his show makes it to air , the proof will be not in the brand but in the pudding			0
" ' @entity53 is n't very reflective of reality ' so what might a new @entity1 sitcom look like ? probably something like @entity90 -- whatever that is these days			1
after all , tv families have always reflected our culture , even if they 've sometimes been a year or two behind the times			0
in the 1950s , " @entity97 " showed off a happy nuclear family in @entity96 , @entity90			2
in the 1960s , " the @entity100 " offered a kennedyesque household in suburban @entity99			0
the 1970s included " @entity105 , " about a blended clan for a time in which divorce and second marriages were becoming commonplace			0
( however , divorce was still stigmatized enough that it was never revealed whether @entity106 was a widow or a divorcee			0
) in the wake of " @entity110 " and producer @entity112 's other edgy shows , 1970s tv families took on the broader appearance of society			0
" @entity120 " was set in a @entity116 housing project ; " @entity119 " featured a single - mother household in @entity118			2
but tv is also nothing if not aspirational , says @entity63 , and @entity124 's unflinching sitcoms -- exceptional even in their time -- were swept aside in the 1980s			1
" television is n't very reflective of reality , " she says			0
" there 's underrepresentation of people of color , underrepresentation of many different types of people			2
still today , there are very few @entity137 - @entity59 or @entity138 people on television			0
" even " @entity17 , " with its upper - class doctor and lawyer living in @entity143 , was often more aspirational than realistic , she says			1
viewers , however , apparently like aspirational			0
since the ' 80s , the dominant family shows have been " @entity17 " and " @entity146 , " " home improvement " and " @entity148 , " " @entity150 " and " @entity149			1
" some have unusual family structures -- " @entity149 , " famously , includes a gay couple , an old - young husband - wife combination and several stepchildren -- but they generally feature white clans and take place in well - off circumstances			1
though there have been several sitcoms featuring people of color or folks in working - class circumstances , about the only breakout exception has been " @entity170 , " @entity167 's early ' 90s hit , which regularly reflected genuine working - class circumstances			1
" compared to like the ' 70s , where you had true diversity -- ' @entity179 ' and ' @entity120 , ' people of all walks of life , jobs and bank accounts -- today it 's as if we 've regressed in some ways , " says @entity171 , president of the @entity172 and tv critic for @entity174			1
he suggests one reason might be because @entity188 is somewhat insular			0
" the networks try really hard at having diverse sitcom writing staffs , but there 's still an issue with a lot of white guys who maybe went to @entity196 and live on the west side of @entity198 who write these shows , " he says			2
next step : senior citizens ? there have been some attempts to change the view on broadcast television , he points out , though new styles have struggled to catch on			0
" @entity210 , " which featured a same - sex couple and their relationship with a surrogate and her family , was canceled after one season ; " @entity218 , " about a middle - class family in @entity220 , has plodded along , " underrated , " in @entity171 ' opinion			2
cable television , which has the luxury of targeting its " reality " shows -- many of which are simply sitcoms in different guise -- at specific demographics , has opted for upscale families ( " @entity231 " ) , heartland groups ( " @entity233 " ) or a mix of flavors ( " @entity236 " )			1
families come in many forms on television , of course -- what was " friends " if not about a family of sorts ? -- and the next wave may include more senior citizens			1
with baby boomers starting to take care of aging parents and being called " the sandwich generation , " a @entity1 show truly reflecting issues across generations could be a hit , says @entity63 , the communications professor			2
or perhaps a new @entity1 show could simply focus on the elderly , @entity171 says			2
" the aged are very underrepresented , " he says			0
he observes that his group 's pick for unsung tv show of the year , @entity261 's " getting on , " is set in an extended - care unit and includes a closeted homosexual , an @entity59 nurse and a variety of senior citizens			2
( @entity261 is a unit of @entity268 , as is @entity6			0
) " it 's almost like a @entity112 show , " @entity171 says			0
a @entity1 show need not go that far -- it 'll be on @entity0 , not @entity261 , after all -- but the lead could make of it what he wants			1
" the great thing is that @entity1 is at an age where he 'll be playing a grandfather , " @entity171 says			1
all you need is one successful show to start a trend , and if a wider range of ages is shown on a tv show , it could lead to others			0
after all , the ultimate family show -- even in these days of dvrs and second screens -- is watching tv , @entity63 says			2
" television is a family event , " she says			0
" families watch television together			0

@entity1 is set to star in a new @entity0 sitcom
" @entity17 " was a landmark family sitcom
latest family sitcoms feature variety of family structures
still , diversity -- of age , *wealth* , color -- often left out of equation , critics say
