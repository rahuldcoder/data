-- last week , @entity1 , the nurse isolated and tested for @entity2 in @entity3 when she returned from working with patients in @entity5 , came to a settlement in her legal battle with @entity8 over a forced quarantine in that state			1
a district court judge ordered that she cooperate with " direct active monitoring , " coordinate her movements with public health authorities and immediately report any symptoms but did n't otherwise restrict her movement			2
but was this the correct decision for the time -- based on medicine , scientific knowledge and best public health practices ? the panic response in much of the @entity23 , as health workers and others have returned from @entity2 - stricken @entity26 , has pitted public officials against doctors against whole communities over the issue of quarantine			1
who is right ? what is best ? medical quarantines are as old as " the plague			2
" they were used in the 14th century when ships arriving in @entity39 from plague - infected ports were forced to lay at anchor for quaranta giorni -- @entity42 for 40 days -- before landing			1
quarantines quickly became the default mechanism for controlling outbreaks of untreatable diseases			0
but are these measures still needed , effective and appropriate in the 21st century ? more to the point , why has the @entity48 decided it will quarantine military personnel returning from @entity2 - stricken areas of @entity26 for 21 days , while the federal government has decided not to enforce quarantine , and multiple states have implemented various quarantine procedures ? legally , the federal government has the authority to quarantine			1
@entity58 grants the @entity61 quarantine and inspection authority , and similar laws exist in most state constitutions			2
however , these powers have rarely been used , in part because advances in medicine have made such measures superfluous			0
in 2014 , we must evaluate laws , treatments and public health measures and adapt them to the times			0
we must ask if this ancient measure is applicable and reasonable during this @entity2 public health emergency			1
there are multiple considerations ; public safety is a big one			0
but then there are costs : economic costs of instituting quarantine to the individual and his or her family and employer , and to local , state and national government ; economic costs of not instituting quarantine -- i.e. , the cost of providing health care if additional cases of @entity2 arise			1
there is a price to pay in individual freedom as well as for the social and emotional effects of quarantine to individuals and families , and of course the social and emotional costs of not instituting quarantine			2
certainly , there are political costs for instituting or not instituting quarantine , and there is a chilling effect on volunteerism for hazardous duty in the hot zone if volunteers can expect to be quarantined on their return home			0
in addition , there are practical issues such as the nature of the quarantine ( voluntary vs. involuntary ) , the length of quarantine , the locations of quarantine and alternatives to quarantine			0
but beyond all of these things , there are science and technology -- and this is critical			0
at a time when we have 21st - century tools and knowledge to decrease the world 's -- and the @entity23 -- risk from @entity2 , to preserve public freedom as best as possible , and to act to reduce not only the health risk but also the economic and social toll from this outbreak , ca n't we come up with a better solution than quarantine ? yes , we can			1
@entity147 , coupled with our on - the - ground experience in @entity26 , demonstrates that a person who has the ebola virus inside his or her body but who has not yet developed any symptoms does not have enough virus to share and is not contagious			0
in fact , on the day someone develops symptoms , the exceptionally sensitive blood polymerase - chain - reaction test for @entity2 is often negative , and the test only becomes reliably positive two or even three days after symptoms start			1
that means someone without symptoms does not need to be in quarantine			0
it does mean , however , that someone with high exposure to ebola virus needs to be monitored			0
can we monitor safely without quarantine ? yes , and this is where technology steps in			1
we have technology to monitor people with devices that can be placed on their wrists and that can send back ( in real time ) their pulse , temperatures and even their blood oxygen levels			1
these devices can relay information to a state public health office and send an alert to an assigned public health officer if there is an abnormal parameter			0
they can also be adapted to alert the person wearing the device to stop and call the public health office			0
this can allow for free range of movement and for a rapid stop to all movement the instant a person becomes symptomatic ( if they ever do )			0
if you think that the use of a wrist - sensing device is an expensive option , it is not ( about $ 100 per person )			1
compare that with the option of a 21 - day quarantine , estimated to cost a minimum of $ 1,000 a day per person			2
the @entity48 could use this option , too , but it has so far opted for quarantine			0
the military likely looked at the cost of managing an ebola patient ( which in the @entity23 is about $ 18,000 to $ 24,000 a day ) and decided that quarantining its personnel ( which costs a lot less than the cost for a civilian to be quarantined ) is a smaller price to pay than the risk of additional @entity2 patients if one of its troops becomes symptomatic			1
the military must pay for medical care of all its personnel and has to avoid unnecessary risks			2
the @entity48 does not have to deal with the issues of who pays for quarantine and who pays for decreased work output while someone is in quarantine ; military laws apply , and the other issues of social , individual freedom , volunteerism and political costs do not apply			2
nonetheless , those in the military , just like those of us in the civilian world should also simply apply current science and technology in handling the potential for @entity2 infection			1
so , yes , the decision by the @entity8 court , which takes into consideration modern science , public health and public fear is reasonable and appropriate for our time			1
let 's hope other states will make such clearheaded decisions .			0

@entity266 : @entity267 said @entity8 nurse @entity1 did n't need @entity2 quarantine
but @entity23 military says it will quarantine personnel coming from @entity2 - stricken areas
@entity274 says quarantine a plague - era practice , and modern science has better solution
@entity274 : it 's *cheaper* and safer to monitor those exposed with high - tech , wrist - sensor devices
