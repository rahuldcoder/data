before boarding the last flight of his life , @entity1 cargo pilot capt. @entity0 confided to a colleague : " these schedules over the past several years are killing me			1
" just before takeoff , his co-pilot also expressed concern about fatigue			2
in a conversation captured by the cockpit voice recorder , first officer @entity10 told @entity0 that she had just gotten a " good sleep , " but she was still " so tired			1
" both @entity0 , 58 , and @entity10 , 37 , died last august when their plane , an @entity16 , crashed just short of the @entity18 , @entity19 , airport just before dawn			1
details of the conversations were revealed thursday during a @entity24 public hearing			1
the board released documents around its investigation and heard testimony from @entity1 officials , pilots , and other experts			1
until thursday , the issue of fatigue had received little attention in the @entity1 accident			2
but with the release of the cockpit transcript and interview records , the crash of @entity1 flight 1354 is now part of one of the hottest debates in commercial aviation : pilot rest			1
' one level of safety ' in january , the @entity48 enacted new rest rules for all airline pilots			1
but the rule excludes cargo crew			2
cargo pilots say the @entity48 should have " one level of safety " for all pilots -- a sentiment expressed in the doomed cockpit -- and say government and industry should place the same value to cargo pilot 's life that they give to airline pilot and passenger lives			1
cargo pilots have special rest needs , they say , because they typically fly " on the back side of the clock " -- at night -- which raises havoc with sleep rhythms and contributes to fatigue			1
@entity1 argues that it gives pilots ample opportunity to sleep , that it has a non-punitive system for pilots who say they are too tired to fly , and that work hours have been largely negotiated with the pilots ' union			2
finally , they stress that pilots share responsibility that they get adequate rest and are fit to fly			1
cockpit conversations even though the @entity24 is months away from determining the probable cause of the accident , the rest issue erupted in full thursday			1
it was raised , in this case , by the ill - fated pilots themselves , their haunting words captured on the cockpit voice recorder			1
as the plane cruised toward @entity18 , @entity0 noted the two - person crew would have two extra hours off - the - clock on the ground , and pointed out their rest period during a previous leg was cut short by a 30 - minute ride to the hotel			1
" this is where , ah , the passenger side ( passenger airline pilots ) ... they 're gon na make out , " he said			2
" i mean i do n't get that			0
you know , it should be one level of safety for everybody , " he said			2
" it should be across the board to be honest			0
in my opinion , whether you are flying passengers or cargo or , you know , box of chocolates at night , if you 're flying this time of day ... " she said			2
" the , you know , fatigue is definitely , " she added , her voice becoming unintelligible			2
" i was out and slept today			0
i slept good , " she said			0
" and i was out in that sleep room and when my alarm went off , i mean , i 'm thinkin ' ' i 'm so tired , ' " she said			0
" i know , " @entity0 responded , saying cargo companies " got a lot of nerve			0
" ' they told us ' the union representing the 2,600 pilots who fly for @entity1 took note of the cockpit conversation			1
" pilots rarely get to speak for themselves from beyond the grave in these cases , " said @entity140 , a spokesman for the @entity141			0
" i 'm going to take their word at face value			0
they told us what was going on at the beginning of that flight , " he said			0
@entity1 said its rules are within @entity48 requirements , and that it had a @entity48 - mandated fatigue risk management program			0
a typical @entity1 pilot is on duty 70 hours a month , and flies less than half of that time			0
@entity1 said both crew members were coming off extended time off			0
the captain had been off for eight days before beginning his final trip , and the first officer had flown just two of the previous 10 days			0
@entity0 had flown 41 hours in the previous 30 days ; @entity10 had flown 31			0
@entity1 representative capt. @entity164 said that " a majority " of the company 's flights occur at night , so the company can keep its commitment to deliver packages by 10 a.m. " that 's the nature of the business , " he said			0
last year , he said , pilots flew 123,000 flights , and on 138 occasions called in to report they were too tired to fly			0
in 96 cases , the company determined that the pilot was within his or her rights , and in 42 cases it deducted days from their sick days after concluding the pilots could have managed their rest periods better			1
@entity141 representative @entity184 said pilots are reluctant to call in tired			0
" members view it ( the company 's response ) as being punitive ; they get dinged for it			0
" at the hearing , experts testified @entity0 and @entity10 missed numerous cues that the plane was descending too rapidly			2
@entity24 investigator in charge @entity195 said he has found no indication that the plane had mechanical problems			1
@entity200 legislation proposed last year in the @entity201 proposes to align rest rules for cargo pilots with those of their passenger airline counterparts .			1

two pilots talked about rest ; transcript of cockpit conversation released at safety hearing
pilot fatigue one of the hottest issues in commercial aviation ; cargo pilots want one rest standard for all
the @entity24 did not find any mechanical problems with @entity16 *jet*
plane crashed in august just short of *runway* in @entity19 ; both pilots killed
