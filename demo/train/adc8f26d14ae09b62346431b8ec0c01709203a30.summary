-- using military - grade helicopters , night - vision equipment and guns fitted with stealth silencers , organized crime syndicates are taking rhino poaching to a whole new level and conservation parks are struggling to keep up			1
@entity9 -- @entity11 's oldest private game reserve -- is now spending half of its annual maintenance budget on security to protect the endangered rhino			1
@entity17 conservationist @entity16 told @entity0 that defense costs could become " unaffordable			0
" " there 's no question we 're fighting a counter insurgency war here , " he said			0
" as much as we increase the risk , all it will do is it will drive up the price of the horns , it will raise the stakes , the poachers will become more organized and better prepared to fight			2
" it 's a problem across @entity11 , but despite investment and innovation , unmanned drones , sniffer dogs and increased security have all failed to halt the rising tide of rhino slaughters , as poachers hunt the herbivores for their horns			1

in @entity11 alone , the government is estimating 1,000 killings for 2013 , while last year there were 668 slaughters			2
but poaching rhino horn is a lucrative industry with much of the loot sold on to the affluent classes in @entity58 , particularly @entity59 and @entity60 , where it is believed by some that the horns can cure cancer and boost virility			1
with a kilogram fetching up to $ 20,000 , a single horn weighs around 10kg , according to a report by @entity68 , a professor in criminology at the @entity70			2
however , exact prices are hard to measure with some saying a kilogram is more valuable than gold by weight			0
@entity68 told @entity0 that some of the crime syndicates , getting rich off their relentless poaching , even include former army and police officers			1
he said : " in some instances evidence suggests that private game operators are involved in rhino poaching			2
these guys are very familiar with all military and poaching techniques			2
" @entity68 suggested that the @entity11 armed forces could have a role to play in deterring poachers			1
he added : " currently our defense force is not involved in any military operation			0
i think this is an opportunity to keep our army active			0
the use of military drones can be handy			0
" read this : boy 's website helps tourists spot big beasts but @entity102 , author of " @entity103 , " told @entity0 the crime syndicates , based in @entity105 and operating across the border in @entity11 , are out of reach of the authorities			1
" you 've got two levels , the syndicate crime that is untouchable , " he said , " and then you 've got poachers being recruited in very impoverished communities in @entity105 and they 're cannon fodder to the syndicates			1
" with poaching operations growing ever more sophisticated , the @entity11 government has considered a radically different approach			1
in july , the government , led by president @entity120 , openly backed a plan for a legal one - off sale of part of its billion - dollar stockpile of rhino horns in an effort to cripple the market			0
the government 's thinking was that it could flood the market by selling stockpiled horn and regulating trade			2
the move , advocates say , would send the current sky - high prices tumbling , thus remove the incentives for poaching , and ultimately help prevent further mass killings of the species			0
but @entity141 , director of wildlife crime and consumer awareness at the @entity143 , told @entity0 legalizing the rhino horn trade could be " disastrous			1
" " a failed experiment such as this could result in the decimation of rhino populations , " @entity141 said			0
" we should not even consider talking about satisfying demand , and especially not about flooding markets , when we have no idea of what demand is , particularly given recent rises in consumption			0
" @entity141 called on governments to make illegal rhino horn trading a priority in order to protect the animal			1
he added : " an integrated enforcement strategy among police , wildlife , military , judges and custom officials is needed to effectively combat the trade			0
" @entity168 contributed to this report .			0
