-- @entity2 are forgoing medical attention in the face of high health - care costs , a new consumer health survey has found			1
the high cost of medical care and treatment has some sick people opting out of treatment , a survey finds			1
specifically , 24 percent of people polled in the 2009 @entity13 decided not to seek medical care when they were sick or injured			1
the largest subgroups were those who were uninsured ( 36 percent ) , and those between ages 28 and 44 , referred to as " gen y " respondents in the survey ( 37 percent )			1
two - fifths of the people who did n't see a doctor when they needed one did so because of the high cost of care			1
they either did n't have medical insurance coverage or they perceived the cost of such care to be excessive , according to the survey , which was released early tuesday to @entity0 by the @entity31 , a nonpartisan , independent research center			2
" costs are impacting the system , and it 's changing how we respond to our health care , " said @entity33 , executive director of the center			2
in addition to data about how many @entity2 fail to seek necessary medical care because of high costs , another theme that emerged in the survey focused on consumers ' dissatisfaction with the nation 's health - care system : 94 percent of respondents said they believe health - care costs threaten their own financial security			1
more than half said they think 50 percent or more of the money spent by @entity2 on health care is a waste			0
only 6 percent indicated their own family is totally prepared to shoulder the financial burden they expect to face			0
not only are @entity2 putting off health care and facing increasing dissatisfaction , they are also shopping around for better deals on doctors ' fees , prescription medication prices or health insurance plans to cut costs , according to the survey			1
there has been a lot of perceived loyalty and commitment in health care , @entity33 said , and many providers think patients will stay with them			0
" this study suggests that people really do n't [ stay ] , " @entity33 added			0
" and that 's surprising			0
" despite the desire to shop around and gather more information to make improved decisions about their health - care choices , the abundance of options also can be baffling , says @entity85 , deputy director of @entity86			2
the group is a nonprofit , nonpartisan health care advocacy organization that regularly advises consumers on choosing insurance coverage plans			0
" people weigh the costs of deductibles versus premiums , and these options can be confusing			0
they are asking themselves , ' what is it that i can afford in the family budget ? ' i sense a lot of people feeling unnerved by having to choose less [ insurance ] coverage because that 's all they can afford , " @entity85 told @entity0			0
the survey also underscored @entity2 ' receptiveness to innovations that potentially lower costs and offer greater convenience , pointing toward growing preferences for options such as retail walk - in primary care clinics in drug stores , medical tourism ( high - quality , relatively inexpensive medical procedures obtained abroad ) and web - based medical services ( often referred to as e-visits )			1
sampling a nationally representative group of more than 4,000 adults using a web - based questionnaire , the survey was funded by the center 's parent company , @entity121 , which has a wide range of clients in the health care industry			2
the center released its first version of the annual survey results in 2008			0
last month , the nonprofit @entity129 released its own health - care survey findings , with even greater numbers reflecting cutbacks in spending on medical services and treatments			1
according to the report , more than half of @entity2 households scaled back health - care spending in the previous 12 months before the survey , which was conducted in early february			2
families relied on home remedies and over-the - counter medications instead of going to the doctor about 35 percent of the time , and they skipped visits to the dentist 34 percent of the time .			0

survey finds 24 *%* of respondents skip medical care when they *'re* sick or injured
