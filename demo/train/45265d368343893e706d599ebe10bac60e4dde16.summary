president @entity1 's announcement that he now supports same - sex marriage reflects a dramatic shift taking place across the country			1
last year , for the first time , polls found a majority of @entity9 share that stance			1
surveys show the country 's position has undergone a rapid change over the past 15 years -- one not seen on other issues			0
on climate change , abortion and the death penalty , " we 're not seeing @entity9 necessarily becoming more liberal , " said @entity19 , editor in chief of @entity21			2
" this one stands a little alone			0
" views of same - sex marriage around the world in 1996 , @entity21 found 27 % of @entity9 supported same - sex marriage , while 68 % opposed it			1
last year , 53 % of @entity9 supported same - sex marriage , while 45 % opposed			1
this year , @entity21 found the country almost evenly split , with 50 % supporting same - sex marriage and 48 % against it			1
sampling error could explain the apparent change from 2011			0
a @entity35 / @entity34 poll found in september that 53 % of @entity9 supported same - sex marriage , up from 44 % in 2008			1
@entity9 attitudes have seen dramatic changes on some other issues , @entity19 noted , but the changes generally have taken much longer			2
" the number of people who said they would vote for an otherwise well - qualified black president used to be well below 50 % , but decades later it 's up to 95 % or higher , " he said			0
it 's been similar for the idea of a woman president			0
two main factors are driving the increased acceptance of same - sex marriage , said @entity51 , senior researcher with the @entity52 , whose surveys have found a similar change			1
the first is " a cultural shift that 's been going on for decades -- not just same - sex marriage , but broader acceptance of gays and lesbians			1
" he points to changing depictions of gay people and fictional characters in media -- something vice president @entity66 referred to sunday on @entity68 's " @entity67			0
" @entity66 apologizes to @entity1 for putting him in tough spot the sitcom " ' @entity74 ' probably did more to educate the @entity9 public than almost anything anybody 's ever done so far , " @entity66 said			2
the second key factor , @entity51 said , is young people			0
so - called @entity77 , born since 1981 , are by far the most supportive of same - sex marriage			1
@entity1 , in announcing his new stance this week , pointed out that his daughters have " parents whose friends are same - sex couples			2
it would n't dawn on them that somehow their friends ' parents would be treated differently			0
and frankly , that 's the kind of thing that prompts a change of perspective			0
" he also said college republicans he meets , who dislike his economic and foreign policies , often express support for same - sex marriage			1
@entity52 found 63 % of @entity77 support same - sex marriage , while 30 % of people born between 1928 and 1945 support it			1
so the changing attitudes in @entity9 are n't just the result of people changing their minds			2
they 're also the result of a changing electorate			0
as more young people become old enough to be polled and vote , and more of the oldest @entity9 die , the figure skews upward			2
still , @entity52 found that even among the oldest @entity9 , support for same - sex marriage has gone up over the past 10 years			1
and while younger people sometimes move toward more conservative positions as they get older , @entity19 said the change on same - sex marriage " seems like something that will stick with them			1
" there have been a few years recently in which polls found support for same - sex marriage had dropped slightly			1
however , @entity21 and @entity52 found those in different years , and pollsters said they ca n't be sure what caused the change			2
an increase in opposition sometimes follows a controversial court decision , they said			0
across the country , there are regional differences in where voters stand , which partly explains why @entity135 this week became the 31st state in which voters supported a constitutional amendment defining marriage as between a man and a woman			0
also , the national surveys assess overall voter attitudes -- not just the attitudes of those who will show up to vote on a specific question in a specific state			0
while the survey trends are unmistakable , they could reverse themselves at any time , @entity51 says			0
" one thing to be careful about is the idea of an inevitable march toward acceptance of ( same - sex marriage )			1
if i were a betting man i would be , but there 's no guarantee , " he said			0
and , he said , " it does n't mean that five or 10 years down the road we wo n't still be a divided country on this			0

@entity21 and @entity35 polls in 2011 found the majority of @entity9 supported same - sex marriage
