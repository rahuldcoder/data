-- six months on from the strike - related violence that left 44 people dead at the marikana mine in @entity4 , unrest and uncertainty still plague the country 's mining sector			1
at least nine mine employees were hurt monday when security guards shot rubber bullets to break up a confrontation between rival union groups at @entity17 's @entity16 mine , in northwest @entity4 , @entity9 said in a statement			1
it 's the latest in a number of incidents at @entity4 mines that have disrupted the industry			1
a string of wildcat labor actions , coupled with rising power costs and depressed commodity prices on the international market , have put pressure on many mining companies operating in @entity4 , the continent 's largest economy			1
" mining companies have really struggled to get back onto production levels prior to the strikes , " says @entity33 , mining leader for southern @entity4 at @entity34			2
he adds that the " heightened tensions " witnessed last year have also raised questions about the role of unions within the mining sector			0
last year 's tensions have been widely blamed on competition for members between rival trade unions -- the more established @entity47 and the fast - expanding @entity48 , which is seen as the more militant of the two			1
@entity33 adds : " six months down the line , there 's quite a big process in terms of redefining the landscape of the unions -- who 's in control and who 's not , who 's got the voice of the workers and who does n't , how do mining companies engage with labor through union			0
" last august , violent clashes at a platinum mine owned by @entity68 , in @entity69 , about two hours northwest of @entity70 , sparked national outrage after 34 people died when police opened fire on striking workers			1
ten others died in the earlier days of the protests , including two police officers			0
after the carnage , wildcat strikes marred by violence became the order of the day in @entity4 's mining sector			1
fatal clashes between rival unions , as well as underground sit - ins , brought several operations to a halt and cost the country big money in lost production			2
in december , @entity92 cited security concerns for its decision to suspend operations in its @entity97 mine , about 100 kilometers west of @entity70			0
the company , which is one of @entity4 's top gold producers , has only now reached an agreement with unions and expects the mine to return to full production toward the end of june			1
last month , discontent among workers rose again after @entity17 , the world 's top platinum producer , announced plans to mothball two mines , sell an unprofitable one and put 14,000 jobs at risk , although those plans are currently on hold			2
the potential job losses could spell trouble for the ruling @entity118 that 's already struggling to deal with the country 's 25 % unemployment			1
unfulfilled promises of a better life post-apartheid have already led to an increase in urban unrest in recent times			0
analysts say that mining is the backbone of @entity4 economy			0
according to the country 's @entity132 , the sector employed about 513,000 people in 2011			1
over the past 10 years , the industry has contributed just over $ 213 billion ( 1.9 trillion rand ) to both the country 's gdp and export earnings , in real money terms			1
after more than a century of mining gold , platinum had become @entity4 's new cash cow			2
but the sector is struggling with an oversupply in the international market and soaring production costs			0
at the same time , pending increases in electricity costs and the potential of further labor unrest over the coming months , when wage contracts will be up for renegotiation , as well as uncertainty over mining legislation , have all helped exacerbate an already challenging situation			0
this has prompted some investors to look for opportunities in other countries			0
" it will vary according to the mineral group and project life cycle but we are likely to see investors looking elsewhere in the region ... particularly if the @entity4 government does n't come out quite strongly and say what its plans for the sector are going forward , " says @entity160 , @entity4 analyst for global business risk consultancy control risks			2
" we are seeing some investors looking to @entity174 , @entity175 and increasingly @entity176 , which has vast untapped natural resources , " she adds			0
police fire tear gas as striking miners protest in december , the government , which is currently amending its @entity182 , moved to ease investors ' concerns by ruling out nationalization as a policy option			0
instead , it opted for " strategic " state involvement in key sectors of the industry and hinted at new taxes as it declared that the " state must capture an equitable share of mineral resource rents through the tax system and deploy them in the interests of long - term economic growth , development and transformation			0
" but , @entity160 says , lack of clarity about the level of state intervention in the industry is keeping investors wary			0
" that is going to be something that investors want to hear more about and want to be reassured about in 2013 , " she says			0
" which state - owned enterprises will potentially increase their involvement in the mining sector but also how the government plans to increase the local @entity4 participation in the sector , through what means and ways			2
" but despite the sector 's recent woes , most analysts agree that mining holds the key to a prosperous @entity4			2
" it 's an industry that 's going through a lot of change and it 's going through a lot of pain , for the better , " says @entity33			0
" if there 's one industry that is very resilient it is the mining industry and @entity4 will get through it and i think it will be for the better in the long run			1
" the mining sector in 2013 is in for quite a tumultuous period but having considered the sector 's contribution to the country 's gdp , but also its contribution to employment levels , the government will have a strong reason to try and ensure that there is policy clarity and also a measure of stability in the medium term , " she says			1
@entity4 mine fires 1,4000 striking miners			1

violence at @entity4 mines creating uncertainty in the industry
last year , thousands of striking workers halted operations at many of the country 's mines
strike - related violence at @entity68 's marikana mine in august left 44 dead
the unrest has prompted some investors to look at alternative options
