being famous must mean never having to say you 're sorry			0
now that @entity2 is n't " famous " anymore , he ca n't seem to stop apologizing			1
the actor -- whose behavior has taken a turn for the bizarre over the past several weeks -- is now performing in a @entity7 - based art installation called " @entity8			1
" the former " @entity10 " star tweeted the hashtag from his @entity12 account around 2 p.m. et on tuesday			0
( it was a change of pace from his usual tweet , " @entity16 , " which he 'd been posting daily since january 20			0
) according to a press release , @entity2 collaborated with artists @entity18 and @entity20 to create the exhibit , which is showing at the @entity22 from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. tuesday through sunday			1
what 's going on with @entity2 ? " @entity2 is sorry , " the press releases states			1
he will be in situ ... for the duration			0
" visitors to the art show are invited to observe @entity2 's performance one at a time			1
before viewing the actor , the visitor stops at a table that bears " implements " -- some of which appear to correspond with @entity2 's career			1
there are things like a " @entity10 " toy , a whip ( he starred in 2008 's " @entity44 " ) , @entity46 's kisses , a bottle of @entity49 whiskey , a bottle of cologne , pliers , a ukelele and a copy of @entity56 ' book , " the @entity57			0
" the last item is an interesting choice , given that @entity2 was accused of plagiarizing @entity61 ' work in december			2
the actor at first said that he 'd been so absorbed in the creative process he neglected to give @entity61 proper accreditation , but then he was also accused of plagiarizing his apologies			0
so is this whole exhibit supposed to be a grand apology both for his use of @entity61 ' art as well as his own career ? visitors do n't find out			1
they 're instructed to select one item from the table of " implements , " which also includes a bowl of comments about @entity2			2
@entity79 's @entity78 took the bowl of messages into @entity2 's performance space , which he describes as a room about the size of a closet , outfitted with a table and two chairs			1
behind the table was @entity2 , wearing a tux and his now ever - present paper bag mask with the words " i am not famous " written on it			2
after sitting down across from the actor , @entity78 described reading " messages ( that were ) mostly negative , some positive , declaring @entity2 either a ' baby , ' an ' idiot , ' or a ' genius			1
' things about having to ' move on , ' or suggestions of ' death			0
' they felt like tweets ; they probably were tweets			0
i read about thirteen notes in measured tones , opting out of the ones that were too harsh or too praiseworthy ; i thought about reading the whole bowl , but then got self - conscious saying so many hurtful things to @entity2 , who in that moment , just seemed like a mixed - up kid			2
( frankly , i hope no one whips him , or worse , spritzes him with cologne			0
) " the @entity114 's @entity113 did in fact choose the cologne , and tried to offer it to the actor but did n't get a response			1
@entity2 was just as silent when @entity113 peppered with him questions such as , " what are you sorry for ? " and " if you 're not famous , why am i here ? " " it was just me and a guy in formal wear with a paper bag over his head sitting there silently , " @entity113 described			2
" through his eyeholes , i could see @entity2 's eyes moving around -- staring at me			1
" but after asking @entity2 if it was really him , @entity113 did get a response			2
i thought he was smiling			0
then i looked at his eyes			0
they were red and watery			0
" " ' can you give me a sign that you 're really @entity2 ? ' " @entity113 asked			2
" and that 's when it happened : @entity2 reached up and took the bag off his head			1
i 'm pretty sure he had been crying			0
" the location of the exhibit , which is free to view , just so happens to be located across the street from the offices of viral content giant @entity149 , and some have wondered if it was intentional			0
there 's also the question of what the whole point of the exhibit could be			0
is @entity2 trying to sincerely apologize , or is he making a larger commentary on celebrity ? is it more about our " copy - and - paste culture , " as he 's said before ? that last theory appears to hold at least a little bit of water			1
some attendees to " @entity8 " have noted the project 's strong resemblance to the work of @entity167 , in addition to other artists .			1

@entity2 has opened an art exhibit in @entity7
the project is called " @entity8 "
visitors sit in a room with the actor after choosing an " implement "
he does n't say what he 's actually sorry for
