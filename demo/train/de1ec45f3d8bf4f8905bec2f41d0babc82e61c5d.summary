-- @entity1 may be flexing its growing economic and military muscles , but the country 's leadership is concerned about its vulnerability on a more nebulous front : culture			1
the @entity1 authorities are clamping down on the type of content being broadcast on the airwaves and websites within the country -- which already restricts and censors a lot of material -- aiming to promote @entity1 culture and reduce outside influences			1
the @entity1 president , @entity18 , warned the @entity20 leadership not to loosen their grip on the country 's cultural scene			1
" we must clearly see that the international hostile forces are stepping up strategic attempts to westernize @entity1 , and ideological and cultural fields are a focus for long - term infiltration , " @entity18 said in an essay published this week in seeking truth , the @entity28 's official magazine			1
the essay was based on a speech @entity18 made to a meeting of party leaders in october where a broad agenda was set out to strengthen the role of @entity1 culture in the country			1
the publication of @entity18 's speech comes as @entity1 prepares to revamp its top leaders this year			1
and it follows a series of crackdowns on dissent after a string of uprisings last year against authoritarian regimes in the @entity53 world			0
amid the nervousness generated by that climate , @entity1 leaders are worried that " the party 's propaganda is no longer working , " said @entity59 , the founder of @entity59 , a popular @entity61 - language website about @entity1			1
television appears to be a key front in the cultural conflict outlined by @entity18			0
in a stark example of the changes the authorities are seeking , the @entity65 , the top broadcasting watchdog , announced tuesday that the number of entertainment shows being aired in the country at prime time had dropped by more than two thirds at the end of the year , to 38 from 126 previously , according to the state - run news agency @entity76			1
the sharp fall was prompted by a directive issued by the watchdog in october -- the same month as @entity18 's speech -- intended to rein in " excessive entertainment " on the country 's tv screens , @entity76 said			2
the order , which came into effect january 1 , restricted the number of entertainment programs that satellite channels can broadcast each week to two , with a maximum of 90 minutes of content defined as entertainment allowed during prime time -- between 7:30 p.m. and 10 p.m. the @entity76 report said that the channels had instead " started to broadcast programs that promote traditional virtues and socialist core values , " including documentaries and cultural and educational broadcasts			0
the @entity1 authorities say they want to keep outside influences at bay , but the general public devours a lot of imported content			1
@entity1 has a strict quota of 20 foreign films per year , but preliminary figures as of mid-december indicated that @entity110 film franchises like " @entity111 " and " @entity112 " were likely to occupy the top four box office spots for 2011 , according to state media			1
@entity1 citizens are also increasingly interacting with the rest of the world , notably the @entity118			2
the number of @entity1 students enrolled at @entity118 colleges and universities in the 2010 - 11 academic year rose 23 % from a year earlier to 158,000 , according to the @entity123 , an nonprofit organization			2
to capture the attention of its own citizens and those abroad , the @entity1 government appears eager to develop programming that shows off @entity1 's own culture			1
in his essay , @entity18 admitted that @entity1 lags the @entity118 and @entity131 in successfully exporting its cultural output			2
" the overall strength of our culture and international influence is not commensurate with @entity1 's international status , " according to @entity18			0
the @entity138 , he said , " has a stronger culture and media landscape " internationally			0
@entity18 listed a number of prescriptions to help @entity1 catch up , including , " cultivate a high degree of cultural awareness and cultural self - confidence , improve the quality of the whole civilized nation , and enhance national cultural soft power			0
" but @entity1 faces the challenge of generating more appealing indigenous content even as it imposes restrictions on tv companies ' schedules and citizens ' freedom of expression			2
fearing that the turmoil in many countries across the @entity172 and @entity173 would incite further unrest in its own population , the @entity1 government last year " expanded restrictions on online information and access to communication services , reported government propaganda in domestic news outlets , restricted the freedom of foreign journalists , and arrested dissidents with little or no cause , " according to a report published in november by the @entity168 , a panel that advises the @entity169			2
@entity176 has put pressure on operators of microblogs to censor posts after criticism and debate flourished on the forums , notably in the aftermath of a fatal train crash in july near @entity186 in the eastern province of @entity188			0
and as of last month , microblog users in @entity176 and many other cities have to register for the services with their real names , although they can choose to publish comments under a pseudonym			0
and the government may impose further restrictions in the future			0
the recent developments are " part of what 's going to be over the next few years a continual tightening on culture and media , " said @entity204 's @entity59 , a longtime observer of the @entity1 media scene			0
" things are not going to get any more liberal when it comes to news , media , films , tv and the internet , " he said			0
@entity0 's @entity213 , @entity214 and @entity215 contributed to this report .			0

' hostile forces ' are trying to ' westernize ' @entity1 , the president says in an essay
the warning comes as the authorities restrict entertainment shows on tv
the authorities are worried that ' propaganda is no longer working , ' an *analyst* says
