@entity0 and @entity1 blocked efforts of other major powers to pass a @entity5 resolution on @entity6 tuesday , with a dramatic dual veto thwarting a call for an immediate halt to the crackdown in @entity6 against opponents of president @entity12			1
nine of the 15 - member council countries , including the @entity15 , voted in favor of adopting the resolution			1
the @entity0 ambassador to the @entity5 said @entity5 action would be " an intervention " that would send the wrong message to the international community			1
" i understand that my @entity26 colleagues are upset , having not obtained a resolution which they were trying to obtain , " @entity0 's @entity23 told reporters afterward			2
" some capitals are being overly hasty in passing their judgment about the illegitimacy of the leaders in @entity6 , " he added			1
@entity15 ambassador @entity33 , meanwhile , said the @entity15 " is outraged that this council has utterly failed to address an urgent moral challenge and a growing threat to regional peace and security			1
" the resolution , if passed , would have called upon @entity6 to stop oppressing its citizens			1
" the unprecedented , aggressive language resorted ( to ) by certain ambassadors against my country , against the political leaders of my country , facilitated my task today , " said @entity41 , @entity6 ambassador to the @entity42			1
" this aggressive discourse reveals the prejudice in certain @entity53 capitals against my country 's political leadership , " added @entity41			2
@entity5 member countries @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 abstained from voting on the resolution			2
" after seven months of near complete inaction in the @entity5 , while at least 2,600 people were being killed , and thousands injured , arrested or tortured , this vote is a disgrace			2
by casting their veto , @entity0 and @entity1 are enabling the @entity6 government 's abhorrent repression campaign , " said @entity67 , the @entity42 director for @entity68			1
meanwhile , another round of violence flared in @entity6 tuesday , as reports of more deaths surfaced amid the relentless government crackdown on protesters			1
the nearly seven - month - long offensive has drawn world condemnation and calls to action against the government of @entity12			2
and a newly formed group of army deserters has issued pleas for help from the international community			2
" this regime will stay until the last drop of blood , " said @entity89 , head of a group of army deserters that has merged into a force called the @entity93			1
" but there ca n't be more bloodshed than there already is			2
" " this is a regime built on force			2
and it ca n't be brought down but with force			2
we lived under it for 40 years			2
" at a @entity107 briefing in @entity108 before the @entity5 vote , spokeswoman @entity105 said adoption of a @entity5 resolution would send a message to the @entity12 regime that " the violence has to stop			1
" " we 've been making the strongest possible case that we can to all of the @entity5 members that , given the bloodshed , given the violence , given the arrests , given the torture that the @entity12 regime has propagated against its own people , it is overdue for the @entity5 to make its views known , and we hope that is a very , very strong message that they are receiving , " @entity105 said			2
also on tuesday , three @entity6 army soldiers and one civilian were killed during clashes in @entity129 in @entity131 province , said the @entity133 - based @entity132			1
security forces chasing wanted people killed a man in the forests of @entity131 between @entity138 and @entity139			0
the activist group , which has a network of contacts across @entity6 , said fighting erupted in the morning between soldiers at a military camp in the northwestern province and armed men believed to be army defectors			1

two law enforcement members were killed , and two were injured			0
it also said that " an armed terrorist group " was responsible for killing and mutilating five citizens in @entity160 after they were abducted and tortured			0
activists blame violence engulfing @entity6 since mid-march on security personnel attacks			1
the @entity6 government says armed terrorists are responsible			1
@entity218 is unable to independently verify such claims , because the @entity6 government has denied international journalists access to the country			1
the @entity93 , meanwhile , is hoping for support from the @entity15 , @entity26 and neighboring countries , such as @entity224			1
@entity225 is asking the international community to implement a no - fly zone and a naval blockade , measures similar to those taken by an international coalition against @entity231			2
the @entity93 is also requesting weapons and wants the regime 's frozen assets			1
" our correct strategy is to protect the demonstrations from the security forces and the shabiha ... until we bring down the regime , " he told @entity218 on monday , making a reference to pro-government forces			0
" if we have a no - fly zone and a naval blockade and the weapons , we can secure an area to operate from and move forward with bringing down the regime			0
" @entity225 told @entity218 that the @entity6 army " strayed from its mission , " and his group decided to make protection of the citizenry its mission			1
" the regime was using the military as its own private army , not an army to protect @entity6 and the people			1
they turned the army into a gang that was killing people , killing innocents , destroying homes , " he said monday			0
@entity225 sloughed off the government claim about armed gangs fomenting violence			1
" from the start of the revolution in @entity6 , we would get orders that there were armed gangs in the country , " he said			1
" but there were no armed gangs			0
" the @entity93 recently claimed responsibility for operations in @entity160 and @entity279 in the east to protect the civilian population and harass army units to prevent them from operating effectively			1
@entity225 said military and security forces are " demoralized and tired			0
" " we are carrying out operations on @entity6 lands			1
there are areas that they are unable to enter			0
there are many areas that they are fearful about entering			0
we are causing them losses			0
" @entity225 said defecting is a serious move to make because of the risks to defectors ' families			0
but the numbers of army defectors are increasing			0
asked whether any soldier with blood on his hands would be forgiven , @entity225 said , " they are killing because they are being forced to			0
