the main administration building in @entity141 was surrounded by sandbags			0
one nearby border crossing at @entity155 -- which was the scene of clashes last week when separatists of the so - called @entity159 tried to bring heavy trucks and an infantry fighting vehicle across the border -- had been reinforced by the @entity163 , with additional troops deployed on nearby hills			2
