-- there is a new strategy in the battle over abortion rights			1
i do n't quite know what to call it , but i have n't seen anything like it since the fictional 47 - year - old @entity10 chose to abort her fetus on tv 's " @entity12 " in 1972			1
back then , the idea was to portray a woman 's choice realistically , but boy , did @entity17 pay a price			2
as the @entity20 noted , the @entity19 promptly organized a campaign against " @entity12			1
" @entity28 , " which played in two parts , drew huge audiences , but when @entity17 repeated them in 1973 , " nearly 40 affiliates chose not to air them , not one corporate sponsor bought commercial time , and @entity17 received more than 17,000 letters of protest			2
" lesson learned ! after that , while abortion was not exactly taboo , it certainly was , shall we say , a decision no tv character made without dire consequences			1
i still remember watching the soap opera , " @entity42 , " with my grandma			2
the character @entity44 unexpectedly got pregnant , had an abortion and promptly started carrying around a baby doll			1
she ended up in a mental institution			2
fast forward to 2014 , and things are changing			2
not only are some tv shows , like " parenthood , " portraying abortion without shame , but activists are too			1
as in posting their abortions online for everyone to see , as @entity57 did			1
" when i realized i was pregnant , i realized this was an amazing opportunity to help women , " @entity57 told my producer			1
" i wished i could show ( women ) what it looks like , that a first trimester surgical abortion takes 3 to 5 minutes , and your greatest risk of having the procedure is infection			1
" @entity71 , then 25 and an abortion counselor at @entity69 in @entity70 , videotaped her surgical abortion procedure and posted it to @entity73 early this year , later entering it into a contest sponsored by an organization called , " @entity76			1
" she came in first place			0
after all , extremism works in @entity80			0
in - your - face behavior seems to be the only message that gets through the other noise			0
abortion rights activists have told me that such " extremist tactics " have been an effective tool of the anti-abortion side of the debate for decades			1
if the group , @entity90 , can project bloody , allegedly aborted fetuses on a 10 - by - 12 - foot screen next to @entity94 's @entity93 to try and prove that abortion is murder , then why should n't women who have abortions use extreme methods to try and prove it 's not ? " there 's an entire war against women 's ' uteruses in @entity80 , " @entity57 said			1
" we believe that in order to truly change legislation and the politics of shame and violence on women , we need to change the culture			0
we believe we need to start speaking , we need to share our stories			0
" according to the @entity114 , a research group that supports abortion rights , 46 states now allow individual healthcare providers to refuse to participate in an abortion			1
twenty - six states require a waiting period for women seeking an abortion			1
and 39 states now require that abortions be performed by a licensed physician			0
and if you think that last stat is not the biggest win of all for the anti-abortion side , you 'd be wrong			1
after @entity130 passed a law this summer requiring , among other things , doctors who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at a hospital within 13 miles of the clinic where an abortion is performed , clinics were initially forced to close			1
had the @entity80 @entity139 not intervened , only 8 clinics would have served a state with a population of 26 million			0
as @entity145 , president of the @entity146 told me , her side is winning			1
the tide , she says , has turned , and no pro-choice , extremist agenda will reverse it			0
" i do n't think women standing up and saying i 've had an abortion , and i 'm proud of it is going to have much of an impact , " @entity151 told me			1
she says abortion ca n't be de-stigmatized			1
" they ( women ) still know it 's wrong			0
" @entity160 , from @entity161 , says it is n't quite that simple			0
" women have a wide range of experiences when they have an abortion			1
some feel a deep sense of relief , some feel a deep sense of regret ... and everything in between			0
" is it possible every one of the more than 40 million women around the world who have abortions every year wind up carrying around a baby doll like the soap opera character @entity44 ? not @entity180 , who writes for @entity181			0
she decided to write about her decision to have an abortion after her @entity184 failed			1
" i always felt strongly about sharing these stories , " @entity180 told me			0
she said she wanted to remove " a stigma around abortion " she does n't think should exist			1
" i did not want to feel shame			0
" and two months after she terminated her pregnancy , she still feels she made the right decision			0
" i had a remarkably average story to tell			0
stories that " do n't get told because of the stigma '			2
" politicians are sharing their stories too			0
and i 'm not just talking about @entity198 , the state senator and now @entity130 gubernatorial candidate , whose filibuster against abortion restrictions catapulted her onto the national stage			2
gone is the @entity204 mantra , " safe , legal and rare			0
" today , politicians , like @entity206 , are talking about their own abortions			0
as @entity209 reported , @entity206 , a state representative in @entity208 , told voters she had an abortion at 16			2
all six of her sisters had gotten pregnant as teenagers , and she did not want to face the same hardships they endured			0
" i do n't regret it , " @entity206 told @entity209			0
" i do n't regret it because i am here making a difference , at least in my mind , for many other young ladies and letting them know that there are options and they can do things to not be in the situation i was in , but to prevent it			0
" the question is : can abortion really be " de-stigmatized ? " it 's difficult for me to accept that abortion is a " simple medical procedure , " but i 'm not all women			2
my abortion rights friends find parts of the strategy to remove the stigma " horrifying " ( the abortion contest ) , but other parts of the strategy effective ( @entity180 's sharing her " unremarkably average " story )			1
my anti-abortion friends are unmoved			2
they could not think of any strategy that would change how they feel about voluntarily ending a pregnancy			2
as a wise man in the news business once told me , " it 's an issue you ca n't win , " because " no one changes their mind			0
" but , then again ...			0

@entity252 : new strategy over abortion rights recalls @entity12 *dustup* in 1972
after that tv *avoided* abortion ; now activists working to remove stigma
she says @entity57 showed video of her abortion ; writers , pols *discuss* theirs
