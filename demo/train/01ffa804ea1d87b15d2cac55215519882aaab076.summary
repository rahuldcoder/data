it may seem weird that the 2004 low - budget breakout comedy " @entity2 " is surfacing as an animated series , but for writer / director @entity4 , it 's not that odd that his world of @entity8 , @entity6 lives on			1
" we were approached about doing a sequel but at the time it did n't feel right , " @entity4 told @entity9			1
" there 's so much low - budget charm in the first film , that it would be hard to recreate that in a live action way in being able to use a real budget			1
" real discussions on turning " @entity2 " into an animated series began more than two years ago , when @entity4 met with " @entity21 " veteran @entity22			1
the pair assembled a pitch and a writing team and are now seeing the fruits of their labor -- a short , six - episode first season , airing during @entity32 's " animation domination " sunday night block			2
whether or not the show will continue past this initial short order remains to be seen , but @entity4 and his staff are busy writing more episodes in the event that they get picked up			1
so how does the process of turning " @entity2 " into an animated series work ? @entity9 recently spoke with @entity4 from his home in @entity43 where he explained just that			1
@entity9 : when did the idea to turn this into an animated series start gestating ? @entity4 : there were different stages , obviously , but it kind of happened when we were shooting the movie			1
but we did n't know anything would happen with the movie at the time			2
it was just a pipe dream			0
it really was my wife 's idea ; we started work on this about two and a half years ago			1
that 's when we met up with @entity22			1
he was already a huge fan of the film and i was a huge fan of his work on " @entity21			1
" @entity9 : the normal thing for a live action show is you have to shoot a pilot before it gets picked up			0
how did it work in this case ? @entity4 : you do a little animation presentation piece to showcase what an episode would look like , design-wise			1
initially , back in the day , for " @entity74 " and stuff like that , it was a two - minute stencil animation test to show what it would look like			0
over the years , they 've ponied up more money because they want to see it fleshed out			1
we actually did a nine - minute pilot presentation , with a story arc and everything			0
we did that about a year and a half ago			2
based on that and addition to a pilot script and other artwork to make a full packet , they decided to order a season or not			0
@entity9 : that 's a serious endeavor			0
@entity4 : especially with the animation			1
one episode , from the time you write it to the color , it takes about nine months			0
just doing an animation presentation , that was about seven to eight months			0
once you get picked up , you have to start hiring people			2
@entity9 : with " @entity21 , " " @entity74 " and " @entity106 , " they had to start out getting an audience interested in their world			0
but we already know the " @entity2 " world			1
how does this show materialize ? @entity4 : we have a staff of about 12 writers and we all lock ourselves in a room ; there 's a couple of dry - erase boards , some sticky notes and we just start pitching potential story lines			1
we zero in on the ones that we think will be the most funny			0
" @entity21 " is coming up on its 500th episode and we have a couple of people that are longtime " @entity21 " people that are working on our show and they 've been valuable			1
we 'll pitch something and they 'll be like " i think we did that season 10 , episode 5			0
" we actually wrote a lot of the scripts as a group for this first season in getting the right tone and what we wanted to establish for the show			0
after we have a script , we get a draft of notes , and then do a table read with the cast as well as people from the network and people that just want to come in and enjoy it			2
it 's a room full of people and we 're reading it out loud and in character			1
after that , we get one more set of notes that we try to turn around pretty quickly and then immediately go and record all the voices			0
you cut together an audio track -- almost like a radio show -- and we cut it to the length of the episode and that goes to the animators and they start storyboarding to the audio track that we recorded			0
then we get an animatic back and we give notes on that and once we 've locked the animatic , it ships off to get animated			2
@entity9 : one of the things about the film is that it does n't rely on bad language , raunchiness or sex jokes			2
but the @entity32 sunday night animation block certainly does in its various ways			0
how does " @entity2 " continue with its style in this case ? @entity4 : we 've been very aware of it and we 're working hard to maintain the innocence that people responded to in the film and keep that			1
@entity32 already has shows that do that and we can be our own thing without trying to imitate what the other 's do			0
@entity9 : who do you see enjoying this show ? who is the demographic ? @entity4 : i have n't been able to isolate that into age group or cultures			1
i think it boils down to people 's specific sense of humor			2
and the film demonstrated that for us			2
@entity9 : what are some of the upcoming plots that you 're excited about ? @entity4 : we have one where @entity212 gets a job at a liger breeding facility and that one 's a lot of fun			1
that was the first episode we wrote as a group , about a year ago			2
one of my favorites is where we have ... in @entity8 , my hometown , they do this thing every year called the bed races , where it 's this annual tradition in the town around @entity228 , where everyone races beds up and down @entity230			0
we 've got an episode about that which is super funny			0
we also have a @entity235 episode , where we had to get their official approval			0
we sent them the script and they were like , " well , there 's some inaccuracies here about the soil - judging competition but we 'll let it go			0
" @entity9 : did you ever win a bed race growing up ? @entity4 : no , i actually did n't			1
i filmed the bed races for my eagle scout project			0
i did a little video for the @entity251			0
] @entity9 : are you working on any new scripts or any new movies ? @entity4 : i got a project with @entity258 ' company that i 'm hoping to do this year			1
it 's a heist comedy based on these people that pulled off the second - largest cash heist in @entity264 history back in 1997/1998 , in @entity265			2
it 's a funny , ridiculous story .			0
