-- several same - sex couples came together in the first minutes of @entity2 in @entity3 to become the first in the state 's history to enter into civil unions			1
" we really do n't want to wait any longer because we have been together for 33 years waiting for the opportunity and our rights and everything that goes with it , " said @entity8 , who was with her partner @entity9 , speaking to @entity0 affiliate @entity10			0
" so why wait ? " the couple told @entity0 last week about their plans to stay up late for the ceremony			0
with @entity20 and @entity21 joining the list sunday , five states now recognize same - sex civil unions , while six other states and @entity25 , allow same - sex marriage , according to the @entity27			1
@entity28 , @entity29 , and @entity30 already recognize civil unions providing state - level spousal rights to same - sex couples , the @entity27 says			1
marriage licenses are given to same - sex couples in @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 and the @entity25 , the @entity27 says			1
@entity42 does not currently allow same - sex marriages to be performed			2
in may 2008 , the state 's @entity44 ruled that same - sex couples have the right to marry in @entity42			1
proposition 8 , a state constitutional amendment defining marriage as between a man and a woman , passed later that year			2
in 2010 , a federal district judge ruled that @entity52 violated the @entity54 , but enforcement of that decision was stayed pending appeal			0
@entity21 said its new law became effective at 10 a.m. sunday			2
in @entity20 , online application for civil union licenses was made available beginning at midnight , despite the fact that government offices are closed until tuesday , the state government said			1
the union becomes valid after a ceremony performed by someone licensed by the @entity67			0
" it means that our state supports us , and that 's a really good feeling after all this time , " @entity68 said at the ceremony			1
the laws in @entity21 and @entity20 followed heated debates in both states			1
in 2010 , then - gov. @entity77 , a @entity78 , vetoed a similar bill in @entity20 , saying the issue needed to be put to a referendum			2
some religious groups were among those pushing for the move			0
" we need you to mount a campaign to flood the governor 's office with requests to veto the bill , " @entity85 , @entity86 bishop of @entity3 , wrote on the @entity3 's website at the time			0
a group called the @entity96 argued that " a vote for civil unions is a vote for same - sex marriage			1
" " civil unions are a desperate and dishonest attempt to force same - sex ' marriage ' on @entity20 , " the group said			1
despite the opposition , there was no referendum			0
in both @entity20 and @entity21 , the language of the law emphasizes that " it is not the legislature 's intent to revise the definition or eligibility requirements of marriage			2
" @entity8 and @entity68 told @entity0 last week they hope there will one day be federally recognized same - sex marriage			1
@entity20 gov. @entity117 , a @entity118 , signed the state 's civil unions bill into law last february , calling it " a prime example of exercising civic courage			1
it is about doing what is right , no matter how difficult , no matter how much opposition			0
" @entity21 gov. @entity128 , a @entity118 , signed his state 's bill into law in may			2
the @entity131 , which says its goal is to " educate , equip , unify and engage the citizens of @entity21 in advocating for family values and preserving the integrity of the family as an institution , " argued that civil unions " are a springboard to redefining marriage			1
" " you ca n't really talk about civil unions without talking about same - sex ' marriage ' because there really is n't any difference , " the group argued			1
but @entity128 , at a signing ceremony last year , said , " this bill is about a new energy and excitement			0
it 's about a moment in our history that came about because people came together to work for it , because it became clear that @entity21 's @entity158 ( lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender ) community is in fact part of every @entity21 community			0
the greater good is served when we speak out and fight hard when we see that bias , prejudice or even outdated laws attempt to lessen any one of us			0
" @entity170 , who was part of the midnight ceremony in @entity20 on sunday , told @entity10 , " the historic part for me is to be one of the first to open that door so that the rest of them after us , there 's others out there that want to do this			2
... we can show them , " hey , you love somebody , you have the right to be with them the rest of your life also			0
' " " our message is go for the gusto , " her partner @entity188 added			0
" do n't be ashamed			0
" @entity0 's @entity192 contributed to this report .			0
