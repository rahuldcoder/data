@entity1 , @entity0 -- a visit to the @entity4 , the @entity5 and the @entity6 is on the itinerary of most jet - setting travelers			1
visiting the @entity4 was voted the most overrated experience by tourists			1
but some of the most famous and iconic tourist attractions in the world are the most disappointing to actually visit , according to a survey of @entity17 tourists			1
and those questioned did n't think too highly of their own country 's best - known landmarks either , with @entity21 , @entity22 and the @entity23 also turning people cold			1
travel expert @entity25 explained why many tourists , often after spending inflated amounts on reaching and then viewing the most famous places , are left with a feeling of anti-climax			1
" it 's easy to be swayed by brochures that opt for the mainstream and focus on clich√©d tourist sights around the world , " she said			1
" but many of them are overcrowded and disappointing			1
" pick carefully and do n't always go for the obvious			1
natural phenomena are usually more exciting than the man - made , and can be wonderfully free of tourists			1
" the @entity4 -- described by @entity42 as " frustratingly overcrowded and overpriced " -- was dubbed the most disappointing international sight			1
@entity17 's biggest letdown was @entity45 , a sacred @entity47 sight in the rural south of @entity0 , which was dismissed as " an isolated pile of rocks in a usually muddy field " by @entity42			1
the @entity56 fountain resembled " a colorless wet skateboard park " while as far as @entity21 was concerned : " once you 've seen it , you 'll know what time it is -- time to go somewhere else			2
" three of @entity59 's most famous sights -- @entity61 's @entity60 and @entity5 plus the @entity62 in @entity63 also made the list of shame			1
but the 1,267 adults questioned by @entity67 also nominated the best places to visit in the world , with the @entity70 in the ancient city of @entity72 in @entity73 topping the list			1
other unmissables included the @entity76 in @entity77 , @entity78 , the @entity80 game reserve in @entity81 and @entity83 's @entity82			2
@entity84 in @entity85 was voted @entity17 's top tourist sight			1
