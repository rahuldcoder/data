@entity0 -- @entity3 's reign as the undisputed no. 1 driver at @entity5 is over , according to @entity5 chairman @entity6			1
the double world champion will be partnered at the @entity9 team in 2014 by @entity10 , the @entity11 who won the last of @entity5 's 15 world championships in 2007			1
" i do n't like no. 1 , no. 2 , " @entity13 told @entity1 ahead of this weekend 's season - ending @entity15 @entity14			1
" no. 1 is the timing , no.1 and @entity18 depends on the timing			2
" @entity13 praised @entity3 's skill -- the @entity21 was the drivers ' champion in 2005 and 2006 -- by giving the 32 - year - old a " good eight out of 10 " mark for a 2013 season which has seen him struggle to keep pace with @entity28 's runaway world champion @entity27			1
@entity13 hopes @entity10 's arrival will spur @entity3 on to greater things in 2014			1
" @entity3 is really a very , very good driver , " said @entity13			1
" i 'm very pleased to have him in the team			0
i am only frustrated that we have n't been in condition to give really a super car in the last seasons			0
" @entity3 knows that he drives to win for himself , but also for @entity5			2
@entity5 is a team and i want drivers ( who ) will drive and will act and react as a team member , not only one man			0
" i think that both of these drivers have good experience ... i think it 's also in the interest of @entity3 to have in the team a driver ready to battle his own competitors , @entity3 's competitors			1
" @entity10 has won 20 grands prix since making his @entity50 debut in 2001 and returns to @entity5 -- he drove for the @entity9 team between 2007 and 2009 -- as a replacement for @entity15 @entity53 , who is moving to @entity55 after eight years at the " @entity56			1
" @entity10 has spent the last two years with @entity57 , having left the sport in 2009 to pursue a career in rally driving			0
@entity13 wanted to recruit a driver of @entity10 's experience given the raft of new regulations set to shake up @entity50 in 2014			1
" i need a driver able to win races or at least to take off points from our main competitors , " said @entity13 of the 34 - year - old			2
" i think he will be in condition to do it			0
" for a car with completely new rules , in which you have to develop without the previous year 's car , you need a driver with experience			0
" do n't forget that @entity10 was the driver that won our last world championship			0
" however , doubts have been cast over @entity5 's ability to manage two drivers who will have their eyes set on a title challenge			1
@entity3 famously clashed with @entity87 while at @entity88 , a rivalry which culminated in the @entity21 joining @entity90 in 2009 before signing with @entity5 in 2010			2
but @entity13 has no concerns of a similarly personality clash this time around			0
" i do n't want to say that they are old ... " @entity13 joked when asked if the two drivers will get along			0
" but i 'm sure , yes			0
