he remembers playing with his childhood friends , running up and down hallways of his apartment building , and listening to @entity19 on big boom boxes			2

he described his childhood as relatively safe and comfortable			0
he still plays basketball on mondays with his old classmates and passes @entity7 to get there			0
" i used to pass by there everyday , " said @entity30 , 23			1
" but all i knew about the neighborhood was what i 'd seen on tv			2
it did n't seem like a place i wanted to go			0
" in 2011 , a crane reduced to rubble the building @entity4 once called home , a high - rise that was part of the @entity7 housing project			1
he watched as the crane 's steel teeth ripped into the 15 - story building , floor by floor , eventually reaching his own 12th floor unit , crumbling it in a cloud of dust			2
just a few months before , @entity4 and thousands of others had been evicted from the @entity7 housing project			1
" it was sudden , all of it was sudden , " he said			0
" we got a notice for a few months and out of nowhere , we all had to get out			0
" he said the empty feeling still remains			0

@entity2 once had the second largest stock of public housing in the nation , with 43,000 units housing hundreds of thousands of people			1
when the units became overrun with gangs and crime , the city embarked on an overhaul			0
the plan aims " to build and strengthen communities by integrating public housing and its leaseholders into the larger social , economic and physical fabric of @entity2 , " according to the @entity95			1
@entity2 wanted stop managing public housing and become what the housing authority called " a facilitator of housing opportunities			1

" i felt something like a refugee in my own city , " he said			0
he turned to alcohol to cope with his pain and looked to friends and family to find a place to stay			0
he finally stopped smoking and drinking " cold turkey , " but his living situation became more difficult			0
for a time , @entity4 made his home on one of @entity2 's " l " trains , which run the longest north - south route across the city			1
he carried clothes and a brick from his old building as he patiently searched for a new chapter in his life			0
even today , he has trouble finding words to describe that experience , only saying it was " rough at times			0
" ' a different world ' as he struggled to find a place to live , @entity4 found a job as a barber on the city 's north side			1
he had only been in the barber shop for a couple of weeks in the fall of 2012 when college student @entity30 walked in , looking for a back - to - school haircut			1
" he came in as a walk - in			0
from there we connected , " @entity4 recalled			2
" he was reading a book and i was interested in knowing what it was and he told me that it was for a class			0
from there i started to get nosy in his business and he told me he was in school for film , so i decided to tell him a bit of my story and it went from there			2
" @entity30 remembers the meeting			2
" when i told @entity4 i was in a film class he said , ' man , you got ta make a movie about me ! ' " @entity30 said , laughing			1
" at first i thought , ' damn , i just want a haircut			0
now this guy 's got me trapped in his chair for 45 minutes and i have to listen to a pitch ! ' " as @entity30 and @entity4 talked over that haircut , they realized they had @entity1 in common			1
" i told him my dad and i used to drive by his building on the way home from school , " @entity30 said			2
" he asked if i ever got out of the car and i had to tell him the truth : ' no , i was scared			0
' " @entity4 offered to take @entity30 for a walk down his side of @entity1 , a journey they documented in their film , " @entity195			1
" in the documentary , which took about a year to make , @entity4 introduces @entity30 to @entity197 , a former @entity198 member known as " @entity199 " whose story complicates the narratives that @entity30 saw as a child on tv			1
" i 'll never forget our first walk down @entity1 , " @entity30 said			2
he remembers @entity206 telling him about the time he chipped his tooth running a race through his buildings with other children			0
" @entity4 and @entity199 's stories made me question what i 'd seen on tv , " @entity30 said			1
" i 'd never thought of the high rises as homes			0
" @entity30 hopes that his film , which was completed last fall , will encourage audiences to think critically about the stories they see on tv , especially those concerning @entity2			1
he and @entity221 are using the 20 - minute film to start conversations on college campuses , an opportunity @entity4 said he could have never imagined			1
" we hope others will take the time to learn from each other no matter how different we seem , " @entity4 said			2
@entity4 now lives in a suburb on the city 's west side in his own apartment			1
despite the lack of a police presence and the frequent sound of gunshots , @entity4 said he sees it as a symbol of his own progress			2
yet , he still longs for his home in @entity7			0
" it was a village			0
we were a community , " he said			0
today , @entity7 is infused with chic dining spots , expensive town homes and a growing shopping district			0
just blocks away from the city 's @entity247 , some are calling it @entity2 's " neighborhood of the future			1
" @entity4 said he would love to help instill that sense of community back into his old neighborhood			1
" i want to recreate a place that i knew once , and provide that for someone else , " he said			0
" i can help because i know what it needs			0
