-- dear @entity1 , some of you will be familiar with the childhood rhyme , " what are little girls made of ? sugar and spice and all things nice , that 's what little girls are made of			1
" marketing and stereotyping combine to have us believe that you 're also made of pink dresses , pigtails , dolls , ringlets , ribbons , bows and tiaras			1
that all you will want to be are wives and mothers			1
that you 're more " inclined " to the arts and " better suited " to caring professions like teaching and nursing			1
and , maybe , that 's true for some			1
but my daughter @entity33 teaches me every day that there 's so much more to you -- and for you			2
@entity33 is 13 , and i can count , on one hand ( in fact , on one finger ! ) , the occasions she 's worn a dress -- and they 've never been pink ! dolls always stayed on the shelf			2
she 's happiest dribbling a soccer ball past her brothers and scoring goals or building model airplanes with her father			2
she dreams of being an engineer			2
that 's my @entity33 ; that 's why i love her			2
so , when i think about girls rising , i think of girls like her and her sister , @entity54			1
i think of the millions of courageous girls all over the @entity57 world and beyond who , every day , summon inner strength , surmount barriers and make a difference in their communities			1
let me tell you about 16 - year - old @entity65			2
some days in @entity67 , there 's less than one hour of electricity , so studying is tough			2
" we were tired of darkness , " @entity65 said in an interview			2
rather than accept defeat , though , she built foundations under her dreams			2
with help from business mentors , she formed an all - female company that created solar - powered lights			0
they won @entity57 's @entity81 in november			0
@entity65 and her friends are part of a new generation of independent - thinking @entity86 girls : torch - bearers and trail - blazers			1
today , almost as many girls as boys attend primary and secondary school			1
in the majority of @entity94 countries where there 's data , women outnumber men at university , and more women than men study science			0
i see and i hear that determination to succeed every day in @entity104			0
recently , i visited a girls ' school in the south of @entity104 where 12 - year - old @entity107 told me about her grandmother , a famous storyteller who narrated other people 's stories			1
@entity107 was proud of her " teta , " but she had her own dream			0
" i want to be mayor , " she said			0
" i want to build a library full of books ; i want to build a park so that children can play safely			0
" @entity107 wanted to write her own story			0
i knew then that she , and girls like her , would write a new chapter for our region			1
it wo n't be easy			0
we have a long way to go			0
increases in girls ' attendance at school and university are not yet reflected in politics , the job market or society 's mindsets			1
and there are still 5 million girls out of primary and secondary school across the @entity57 world			1
but as the political , social and economic plates shift and settle around our region , there 's never been a better time for girls to rise up and share their talents with society			1
and , girls ! society has never needed you more			1
we know that in every country around the world , healthy , educated girls can play a crucial role in stabilizing societies , resolving conflicts , bolstering democracies , strengthening economies and nurturing healthy and educated children			1
but they ca n't do it alone			0
but if we want all girls everywhere to rise up , then we must find them , befriend them and support them			1
that means going outside our comfort zones			0
maybe they 're recovering from civil war in @entity166 , like @entity167 -- now educated and a popular radio dj. maybe they 're trapped in servitude in @entity171 , like @entity172 -- now an activist working to free others			0
maybe they 're living in slums in @entity177 , like @entity178 -- now strong and in school			0
( find out more about their stories			0
) and it means using our voices to speak up for those who can not yet be heard			0
lobbying for girl - friendly policies			0
working with governments , non-governmental organizations , @entity190 agencies and the private sector to create momentum for change			0
will it be easy ? no. will it be as hard as studying in the dark or sleeping on a pavement ? enduring slavery or rebuilding a life after war ? going to school hungry and still achieving good grades ? certainly not			0
and if we falter in our resolve , let 's remember the strength and dignity of @entity65 , @entity107 , @entity167 , @entity208 , @entity178 and girls everywhere who , every day , fight for their right to education and opportunity			1
if one girl with courage is a revolution , imagine what feats we can achieve together			0
