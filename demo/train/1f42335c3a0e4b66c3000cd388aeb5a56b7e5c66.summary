@entity0 , @entity1 -- a @entity7 couple tried to name their baby " @ , " claiming the character used in e-mail addresses echoed their love for the child , an official trying to whip the national language into line said on thursday			1
the unusual name stands out especially in @entity7 , which has no alphabet and instead uses tens of thousands of multi-stroke characters to represent words			1
" the whole world uses it to write e-mail , and translated into @entity7 it means ' love him ' , " the father explained , according to the deputy chief of the @entity21			1
while the " @ " symbol is familiar to @entity7 e-mail users , they often use the @entity31 word " at " to sound it out -- which with a drawn out " @entity37 " sounds something like " ai ta , " or " love him , " to @entity36 speakers			1
@entity38 told a news conference on the state of the language that the name was an extreme example of people 's increasingly adventurous approach to @entity7 , as commercialisation and the @entity47 break down conventions			2
another couple tried to give their child a name that rendered into @entity31 sounds like " @entity53			0
" @entity38 did not say if officials accepted the " @ " name			2
but earlier this year the government announced a ban on names using @entity60 numerals , foreign languages and symbols that do not belong to @entity7 minority languages			2
sixty million @entity7 faced the problem that their names use ancient characters so obscure that computers can not recognize them and even fluent speakers were left scratching their heads , said @entity38 , according to a transcript of the briefing on the government web site ( www.gov.cn )			0
one of them was the former premier @entity77 , whose name had a rare " rong " character that gave newspaper editors headaches			0
