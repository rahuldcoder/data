@entity87 lashed back at a scathing state report that concluded she " either knew or should have known cheating and other misconduct were occurring in the @entity18 system			1
" " we reaffirm dr. @entity87 's position that she most definitely did not know of any widespread cheating on the @entity98 ( @entity98 ) in 2009 or any other year , " she said in a statement released through her attorney			1
the state 's report indicated there was a climate of cheating and performance - at - all - costs during @entity87 's tenure			1

@entity158 , whose three children attended @entity18 , said the school board failed to hold @entity87 accountable and did not adequately address the cheating before the state stepped in			1
