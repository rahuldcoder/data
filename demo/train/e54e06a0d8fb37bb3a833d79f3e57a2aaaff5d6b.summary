-- a most awkward and revealing situation has emerged in the heart of @entity3 , forcing @entity3 governments to choose between their principles and their fears , and drawing an uncomfortable gap between @entity3 's words and its actions			1
last july , a bus carrying tourists about to start their vacation suddenly exploded outside the airport in the @entity15 city of @entity16			2
the bombing killed five @entity18 -- including a pregnant woman -- and a @entity15 driver			2
this week , @entity15 's foreign minister blamed @entity22 , saying an investigation showed the attack was carried out by two members of the @entity28 - linked @entity27 organization			1
but @entity15 says it discovered strong links , with " data showing the financing and connection between @entity22 and the two suspects			1
" the news shines a light on a most surprising fact : @entity22 has been conducting business rather comfortably in much of @entity3 over the years , openly raising money for its operations			1
those operations , according to countless investigations in a growing number of countries , include plotting and attempting to kill tourists , diplomats and others			0
@entity48 , which labeled @entity22 a terrorist organization in 1995 after a series of attacks in @entity27 and elsewhere that killed hundreds of @entity52 , has been pressuring the @entity53 to do the same			1
but the @entity53 has resisted			2
the " terrorist " designation is more than a symbolic label			0
the label would allow @entity3 authorities to freeze funds , control the travel of @entity22 operatives , and otherwise do what it can to prevent more loss of life			1
the new secretary of state , @entity63 , urged the @entity53 to " send an unequivocal message to this terrorist group " now that @entity22 has been linked to an attack on @entity3 soil			1
@entity52 officials have told @entity3 that their inaction is " making it harder to defend our countries			2
" @entity52 officials accuse @entity28 and @entity22 not only of conducting attacks against civilians around the world , but also of actively supporting @entity79 president @entity78 's brutal repression at home in a conflict that has already left more than 60,000 dead			1
opinion : why @entity83 is going to @entity18 according to a new report from the @entity85 , authorities in various countries have uncovered and disrupted nearly 30 different terror plots by @entity22 or @entity28 's @entity89 , an arm of the @entity91 , in the last couple of years			2
but @entity3 , incredibly , continues to waver			2
@entity53 foreign policy chief @entity93 reacted to the news from @entity15 with a clammy statement that there is a " need for reflection			1
" @entity22 operates in @entity27 as a powerful @entity100 political party , social services organization and an intimidating , heavily - armed militia			1
it has strong support among the country 's @entity100 population and bitter opposition from @entity107			0
@entity53 officials say they fear destabilizing @entity27 , a country perennial teetering on the edge of sectarian violence			1
they also worry about angering @entity22 , fearing attacks on @entity3 peacekeepers in @entity27 or terrorist attacks on @entity3 soil			1
judging by recent events , that particular outcome was not prevented by their timid approach			0
@entity119 , in particular , has resisted upsetting @entity22			0
@entity120 has taken the lead in fighting extremism in @entity123 , sending troops against militants in @entity126 and declaring that it is committed to " a relentless struggle against terrorist groups			0
" but it is somewhat less relentless when it comes to @entity22			0
the @entity119 take a special interest in protecting their influence in @entity27 , a former colonial holding			0
a firm @entity136 stance against the group , however , could strengthen @entity27 's struggling @entity136 opposition , which blames @entity22 for the assassination of many of its members , including former prime minister @entity142			1
a @entity144 tribunal set up to investigate @entity142 's 2005 assassination indicted four @entity22 members			2
the pattern is well established			0
@entity149 prosecutors accused @entity22 of carrying out and @entity28 of planning and financing the worst terrorist attack in that country , the 1994 bombing of a @entity154 , which killed 85 and injured 300			1
@entity136 experts generally agree with the assessment of the former @entity52 homeland security secretary , who describes @entity22 as " the most potent terrorist organization in the world			1
" the government of the @entity161 already declared it a terrorist group and @entity163 named its militant wing a terrorist entity , as if it were separate from the rest of the organization			2
it is funded by @entity28 and closely coordinates its moves with @entity169			0
over the years , it has been accused of carrying out attacks throughout the world , often in collaboration with @entity28			0
in recent months , as tensions have risen between @entity28 , on one side , and @entity18 and the @entity136 on the other , @entity169 and its @entity27 ally have stepped up their activities to a feverish pace , targeting @entity18 diplomats and tourists in @entity180 , @entity181 , @entity182 and elsewhere			0
@entity22 and @entity28 were linked to a plot to kill the @entity185 ambassador in @entity48			0
@entity22 's protective ally , @entity28 , is enduring harsh economic sanctions from the @entity136 over its controversial nuclear program , and a number of @entity28 nuclear scientists have been assassinated , as have a few key figures in the @entity22 hierarchy			2
the circumstances of these assassinations have all been murky , but there is nothing vague about the bombing of buses full of tourists			0
by any definition of the word it qualifies as terrorism			0
and clearly , the question is not just symbolic			0
@entity3 is letting @entity22 operate on its soil			1
by some counts , there are 950 @entity22 - affiliated individuals in @entity208 alone			0
@entity3 wants to treat @entity22 as a legitimate political organization , but the group 's actions place it squarely outside the realm of legitimacy			1
as long as @entity3 closes its eyes to this reality and allows the group to organize , fundraise and hold meetings , it is guilty not only of hypocrisy , but also of passive complicity in @entity22 's attacks on innocent civilians			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity225			0

@entity225 : @entity15 blamed @entity22 in bus attack , yet @entity53 still wo *n't* call group terrorists
she says doing so would let @entity53 freeze group 's funds , control its travel , *averting* attacks
but @entity53 fears angering group , destabilizing @entity27 ; let 's @entity22 raise funds in @entity3
@entity239 : in letting group claim legitimacy , @entity53 passively *abetting* a terrorist organization
