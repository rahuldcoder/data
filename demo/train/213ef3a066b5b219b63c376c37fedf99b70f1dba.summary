@entity0 -- the volume of @entity0 property sales fell 60 % compared with last year in a sign that recent government policies are cooling one of the world 's most expensive real estate markets			1
the @entity9 recorded about 4,400 sale and purchase agreements in april with a valuation of $ 4 billion -- a 48 % drop compared with the previous year			2
" i 'm not surprised , " says @entity14 , chief analyst for strategic development and research at @entity17			0
" this is largely due to the measures implemented by the government			0
residential property transactions -- primary and secondary -- dropped significantly			2
non-residential transactions also dropped -- industrial spaces , car parks , commercial spaces			0
" the slowdown in @entity0 's property sales was expected , echoes @entity30 , executive director of research and advisory at @entity33 in @entity0			1
" most homeowners find they do n't have a very strong reason to sell , " he says			0
" they can wait for a couple of years " because of the government 's property policies			2
on february 22 , the city announced a doubling of the existing stamp duty , or @entity42 , to 8.5 % to target investors who want to buy a second property to lease			2
from april 2010 , that rate had been set at 4.25 %			0
in october 2012 , to target short - term investors seeking to flip a house for profit , @entity0 extended the existing special stamp duty , or @entity50 , on property resales from two to three years			1
if the owner sold the property within six months of purchase , a 20 % duty would apply -- between one and three years , a 10 % levy would apply			1
also in october , @entity0 enacted a 15 % buyer 's stamp duty , or @entity59 , against home purchases by foreigners			2
" altogether , we 're talking about an additional 40 - plus percent increase in costs , " says @entity66 " so you can imagine if you 're the buyer then you 're just going to hold on and wait			0
" @entity0 's layers of levies have also stifled interest from mainland @entity71 buyers -- with the 15 % tax for foreigners widely interpreted as an attempt to stop them			1
" two years ago , 40 % to 50 % of all home transactions in @entity0 were by mainlanders , " adds @entity66 " now most buyers are local and most mainlanders are n't making any moves			2
" in @entity0 's super luxury market , defined around $ 13 million and above by @entity87 , " mainland buyers have all dried up " says @entity81 luxury homes , defined at around $ 2.5 million and above , can often be found in @entity0 's prime districts of the mid-levels and the @entity84			2
" two years ago , we would normally have ten to 15 luxury home sales every week			0
now it 's less than five , " @entity30 says			0
@entity0 property has notoriously been some of the most expensive in the world for years			1
as recently as spring 2012 , @entity93 found @entity0 as the most expensive in a company survey , outranking @entity95 , @entity96 , @entity97 and @entity98			0
property prices soared in the special administrative region 50 % between 2010 and 2012			1
just last year , @entity0 's priciest apartment -- the @entity103 - designed @entity102 -- sold for $ 58 million making it one of the most expensive residential properties in the world			1
but now , as property transactions fall , property prices will follow , say @entity14			1
" they are falling already , " he says			0
" the average price correction has been 2 - 3 % from march and april -- and it will carry on in may			1
but property prices have dropped by as much as 6 % between january and march for some properties already			1
" @entity14 adds that property prices " are very likely " to continue to fall but by " no more than 10 % "			1
" it 's all supply and demand			0
demand has dropped significantly even as supply has stayed the same			0
the only option is to lower the price			0

@entity0 property sales fell 60 % in april 2013 year - on - year
government policies aimed at short term investors , mainland @entity71 taking *effect*
fall in sales volumes hit both residential and commercial properties
analyst : average property prices fell 2 - 3 % since march ; may fall no more than 10 %
