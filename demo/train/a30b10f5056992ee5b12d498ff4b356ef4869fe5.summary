when @entity1 woke up each morning , she grabbed her @entity2 , pressed a few buttons and saw her son , @entity4 , in a hospital a few miles away			0
@entity4 , who weighed 2 pounds , 2 ounces when he was born prematurely , was in the neonatal intensive care unit at @entity7 in @entity8 , @entity9 , for more than 11 weeks			1
@entity10 and her husband , @entity11 , visited their son as often as possible while juggling responsibilities at work and home			0
but even when they could n't be with @entity4 , they could see him around the clock -- as long as they had an internet connection			0
a camera mounted above @entity4 's incubator provided the couple access to a live video stream that they could watch from their phones , laptops or computers			2
" there were times in the middle of the night that i would have to see him , " said @entity10 , who has logged on at 2 a.m. " it would give me such a sense of relief			0
" @entity7 is one of the first hospitals in the country to implement a webcam system called @entity42 , which gives parents a virtual window to their newborns			1
most of the babies in @entity7 's neonatal intensive care unit , which has 14 incubators , are born prematurely and are released within four or five days			1
some , however , stay for months			0
the password - protected webcam system is also being used at a handful of hospitals across the country , including @entity54 in @entity55 , @entity56 , and @entity57 in @entity58 , @entity59			1
@entity60 in @entity61 , @entity9 , expects to introduce the system in the next few weeks			1
numerous other facilities are exploring the idea or looking for funding			0
cameras run about $ 1,000 each in addition to an annual service fee that covers technical support and other costs			1
those who have used the system said it is well worth the investment			2
" the family feels that they are really connected to their infant , which is important for bonding			1
in the past , the bonding process had to be instituted every few days , " said dr. @entity81 , medical director of the neonatal intensive care unit at @entity7			1
" the family dynamics are improved			2
" while the @entity7 unit has an open visitation policy , only adults are allowed in so as to protect the babies ' immature and susceptible immune systems			1
in most cases , babies get well under intensive care			1
individual cameras above each baby 's incubator provide a continuous stream of live video			1
@entity81 said he often waves to the camera to reassure family members			2
at @entity7 , one camera is designated per baby and is turned off only during medical treatments , rounds or at a doctor or nurse 's discretion			1
" the @entity112 is a special example of a time when parents need that bonding experience , " said @entity108 , one of the four partners / founders of @entity42 , based in @entity111			1
parents have the option of sharing the password with relatives or friends who live far away , he said			2
about half of the sessions originate from web - enabled devices such as @entity125 , iphones , droids and @entity128 , said @entity129 , one of @entity108 's partners			2
" we can tell that people are using these while they are sitting in a car , " @entity129 said			0
@entity10 remembers how vital that access was for her family			2
when her husband returned to work , he hooked up another screen to his computer so he could see @entity4			0
" when he had to be at one place to support his family , it gave him such closeness , " said @entity10 , recalling the anguish the couple felt about having to leave their son at the hospital			2
" he could have a connection with him every minute of the day			0
it 's a priceless feeling			0
it 's just an absolutely amazing tool			0
" @entity155 , governance manager for the @entity156 of @entity157 , can see only one potential downfall to the system : the possibility that a parent witnesses an emergency situation before the camera can be turned off			0
@entity164 gave birth to premature twin sons , one of whom died in the neonatal intensive care unit			1
the other was released after six months			0
she said the advantages of the camera system far outweigh any possible downsides			0
" i think it would help encourage parents to take care of themselves because it 's an emotionally and physically draining experience , " she said			1
@entity108 and his team , which includes developer @entity179 , came up with the idea for the camera system after visiting @entity181 , which was using cameras at infants ' bedsides			1
@entity108 and his partners enhanced that basic camera system so that it would be compatible with any web - enabled device and designed it so that it would not affect the performance of the hospital 's network			1
parents who had problems seeing their babies when the hospital was using its own system called the unit			1
now those calls go straight to @entity42 , freeing up the nurses to do their jobs , said @entity203 , nurse manager of the neonatal intensive care unit at the @entity57			1
" it really connects the families with their baby , " @entity203 said			0
" it helps that separation			0
while that mom is at work , she can have access to seeing her baby and she does n't feel like she missed that much			0
" @entity203 said she sees other applications for the technology and said it could be used on older patients with dementia or other illnesses			0
@entity221 , nurse manager of the neonatal intensive care unit at @entity54 , agreed and said she sees an application for oncology			1
using the cameras in the neonatal intensive care unit is particularly important , given the strain on a family that goes along with having a sick child , she said			1
some babies can be there for six to eight months , she said			0
" it 's a very emotional time because ( the parents ) want to be here , but they have to go back to work , " she said			2
@entity54 has six cameras that are mounted on iv poles			0
@entity221 said she hopes the hospital can buy enough to have one camera per infant and allow families access around the clock			0
several staff members already have been trained on the system , learning where to place the cameras , how to turn them off and how to explain the process to parents			1
there have been some minor technical challenges , she said , but overall the hospital is thrilled with the system			0
the webcams recently were installed at @entity253 in @entity9			2
staff members are being trained on the system , and the hospital is scheduled to begin using @entity42 by @entity256 , said @entity257 , vice president of business development			1
many babies who are brought to the neonatal intensive care unit at @entity60 are transported from other hospitals			1
the system will make it easier for parents who live 30 minutes or more away to see their babies , she said			2
" it 's more important for them to have that internet access to their babies , " @entity257 said			2
@entity269 , clinical manager of the neonatal intensive care unit , said babies at @entity60 typically stay for seven to 14 days			1
while most are premature , others are full - term babies with infections or feeding or blood sugar problems			0
@entity275 , who delivered at @entity7 , said the system was a blessing for her and her family			1
her son , @entity279 , lived for only a week			0
relatives in @entity281 , @entity282 and on the @entity283 saw him on the webcam and talked about how much that meant at the baby 's funeral , she said			2
" you just never know how precious those moments will end up being , " she said			0
" in our case it went from being ok to a lot worse in a matter of hours , and it made such a huge difference to be able to know that we had that access			0
