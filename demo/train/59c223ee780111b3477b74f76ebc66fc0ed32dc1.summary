-- good move , governor			2
and you did n't even let on			2
when we chatted briefly at the @entity5 a few weekends ago , you looked very upbeat and energetic			0
i had no idea that you had undergone @entity9 stomach surgery to lose weight and when i wrote that @entity0 piece about you on february 8 saying you needed to take your doctor 's advice seriously and do whatever you could to drop some pounds , i had no idea you probably had made the decision already and were heading into surgery in eight days			1
congratulations ! now some are saying that your decision to make such a drastic move to drop what could be at least 100 pounds was motivated by your desire to run for president in 2016			1
being 5 - foot - 11 and weighing at least 300 to 350 pounds at 50 might not be conducive to occupying the @entity24 as 45th president of the @entity26			0
you told the @entity28 that you did this first for your family , for your kids			1
those are the same factors that led to my decision seven years ago			0
they also motivated men like @entity38 's @entity37 , @entity40 coach @entity39 and former rep. @entity41 to do the same thing -- and it had nothing to do with political aspirations			1
" it 's so much more important than that , " you told the @entity28			1
we 'll leave that to history to decide			0
still , you knew that being morbidly obese ( yes , that 's how you describe people who are 100 pounds or more over their ideal body weight ) would be something that would ultimately kill you , probably as a relatively young man			1
you do n't see a lot of 80 - year - old obese people , do you ? and , at 50 , with four wonderful children , you have a lot to live for and a lot of life ahead of you			1
then there 's a possible future in @entity63			1
for a public person , a governor , these decisions are terribly personal			0
you had to consider the risks of doing nothing or having a fairly aggressive surgery like gastric bypass -- or doing something a little less aggressive like the @entity9 , also called the adjustable laparoscopic banding system			1
in that procedure , doctors put a silicone tube , which is like a big rubber band , around the top of your stomach , restricting the amount of food you can take in			1
they fill that tube with saline , squeezing the size of the entry into the stomach even more so you can eat even less			1
they can also adjust the band to allow for more food			1
this can result in the loss of at least 100 pounds within the first year to 18 months , but it does carry some risks			0
some say you 've already dropped 40 to 50 pounds , which would be typical eight to 10 weeks after the procedure			0
but there will be haters			0
some will say that your lifestyle of excess over the years led you to this point , and that it 's lazy to go under the knife to resolve such a dramatic problem rather than bear down , hit the treadmill and do it the hard way			2
others will question why you decided to do the @entity9 procedure rather than the permanent @entity112 gastic bypass			2
some people have had to remove the bands because they caused painful irritation and scar tissue in their stomachs			0
i had the @entity112 procedure , which can be initially more dangerous but is often recommended for those who require dramatic weight loss in a shorter period of time			0
and then there will be those who said you did all this just because you want to be president in 2016			2
a fat president was n't even a good look for @entity130 back in 1909			0
some or all that may be true , but really , governor , we know there 's a lot more to the story			2
you did this to live			2
you did this because 50 is just too young to drop dead of a heart attack , diabetes or a stroke			0
you did this for your health			0
not to mention that it would be kind of sad to get out - hustled in @entity146 or @entity147 or @entity148 by @entity149 simply because you needed to stop and catch your breath on the campaign bus			0
but most important , you did this so you would be around for your kids , your wife , your family , your state and your country			1
and i say , more power to ya ... the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity163 .			1

obese @entity166 gov. @entity165 underwent lap band stomach surgery to slim down
@entity165 says he did it for wife and kids , but some think it 's for a 2016 presidential run
@entity163 had gastric bypass surgery , warns @entity165 there will be *criticisms*
but @entity163 says like himself , @entity165 did it to live a healthy , long life
