@entity0 , @entity1 -- during the past two weeks , millions of @entity1 have taken to the streets to protest years of dissatisfaction and discontent with their government			1
what started as a student mobilization transformed day by day to incorporate professionals , the middle class , and residents of the favelas , or slums			1
all are joined in protest against the administration of president @entity18 , though their motivations may differ			2
some 6 % of @entity1 live in the favelas , according to the 2010 census			1
these mountains of bricks , rising in intricate forms , border the country 's largest cities like @entity0 and @entity26			2
hospitals , schools , security and an end to police abuse are the principle demands from this social sector			1
@entity34 , resident of @entity35 , the second - largest favela in @entity0 , has worked as a maid for 15 years			0
she decries that there are no public hospitals or more schools inside the favela			0
her 15 - year - old son dropped out of school two years ago and his return to the classroom has been denied because of lack of room			0
@entity35 is home to 100,000 people			0
the community has the worst schools of the state and local education system -- lagging in primary education , behind in literacy and lacking control over the adolescents , according to an index of development in primary education			0
the children in the favelas can attend the public daycare centers until they are 4 years old			1
the elementary schools run only half a day , a schedule that causes problems for parents who work eight - hour shifts			0
' we do n't have hospitals ' " the only ones who do something for us are the businesses , " @entity68 said			0
" we do n't have hospitals			0
the only place where we can take our children is the @entity76 , a community program that is privately financed			0
when i ask for a visit , they give me an appointment in three months or more			0
" the closest available public hospitals , she says , lack equipment			0
" many say the fight is over public transportation , but why does no one hit the streets so that they raise the minimum wage , " said @entity85 , a janitor who spends $ 30 a week for transportation to her job			0
@entity94 and her 5 - year - old son are beneficiaries of @entity97 , a welfare program instituted in 2003 that helps more than 13 million families living in poverty			0
this week , the residents of @entity103 , one of the largest favelas in @entity26 , joined the anti-government protests			1
the immediate motivation was police abuses and security problems in the community			2
just hours before the protests , a battalion of special forces had entered the favela , causing nine deaths and nine injuries			2
schools closed and 7,000 children were left without classes , according to the non-governmental organization @entity121			0
the new middle class one of the government 's accomplishments is that some 50 % of the @entity1 population has entered the middle class			1
of this figure , 40 million were added to the middle class between 2004 and 2010 , under the government of president @entity130			1
but rising income has not kept people from joining the protests			2
according to a survey by the @entity1 @entity135 , 79 % of the protesters earn more than twice the minimum wage , and 76 % are employed			1
close to 40 % of the protesters had not been born during similar massive protests in 1992			1
in those protests , university students mobilized to demand that then - president @entity142 step down			2
they remained in the streets until the president resigned amid corruption charges			2
@entity146 : rising middle class fuels @entity1 's protests ' together for a cause ' " i think these are the first protests from a public that spent years doing nothing , " said @entity150 , a 21 - year - old student			1
" before , we saw some smaller protests , but this is the first time we all joined together for a cause			2
" the movement sprang up in response to an increase in public transportation fares , but it has turned into a broader war cry , with protesters holding signs decrying corruption , poor public services and lack of investment in education and health			1
" i decided to come because i ca n't stand the corruption in @entity1			1
here there is no money for hospitals and schools , but yes for stadiums , " said @entity177 , who marched for the first time last week , during the largest of the demonstrations			0
the arrival of the @entity182 criticism against the spending to organize the @entity182 has spread across the country			2
a year from the event , half of the stadiums are not ready and it has become clear the need for new infrastructure was underestimated			0
" when @entity1 was selected as the host of the @entity182 five years ago , we celebrated			1
we celebrated because we did n't know that it was going to cost so much , " said @entity193 , a 53 - year - old taxi driver			0
" our leaders should have known that @entity1 was not in a condition to organize the event			1
" understanding the current social unrest in @entity1 becomes a harder task every day			1
however , if there is something that has unified the middle class and the favelas , in addition to general discontent , it is disapproval of the president			1
even though their demands may not be the same , the dissatisfaction seems to reach the same levels			0
