@entity0 -- years - old but newly scrutinized videos of @entity4 economics professor @entity3 ignited a political firestorm this week because the self - described architect of @entity7 thanks " the stupidity of the @entity10 voter " for leading to passage of the president 's signature piece of legislation			1
with @entity7 open enrollment set to begin over the weekend and the @entity17 set to weigh in again on the law next year , @entity15 pounced , using the videos as additional ammunition in their case that president @entity22 and his administration misled the @entity10 public on @entity7			1
@entity22 on sunday dismissed the idea that his administration and other proponents of the law misled voters about the legislation , noting that " we had a yearlong debate			2
" " the fact that some adviser who never worked on our staff expressed an opinion that i completely disagree with ... is no reflection on the actual process that was run , " @entity22 said			0
so why should old videos of an economics professor matter ? here 's the gist : @entity3 called voters stupid , republicans are calling him the @entity7 architect , and @entity45 are calling it all a big misunderstanding			1
still confused ? this will help : was @entity3 the " architect " of @entity7 ? not exactly			1
this is a law that was passed by both houses of @entity52 and written in different forms by several congressional committees			0
it 's many thousands of pages long and has a myriad of different provisions			0
but @entity3 clearly played an important role in crafting the idea behind the series of exchanges , subsidies and taxes that form the law 's centerpiece			1
he continues to argue the country is better for @entity7 -- but we 'll get to that			0
and he does n't look nearly as cool as this guy , who actually goes by the name , " the architect			0
" so why is he being called that ? and what did he actually do ? @entity3 's work did shape the @entity7 in three key ways : 1			1
@entity3 played a crucial role in crafting the health care law passed in @entity78 during then - gov. @entity80 's tenure			1
@entity3 modeled the impact and effectiveness of that state 's plans to implement an individual mandate -- the controversial policy that essentially forces people to get covered , or get fined			2
and this matters because the 2004 @entity78 law was the model for @entity7			1
the " individual mandate " became a key component -- and political lightning rod -- of the health care law most people now call @entity7			2
@entity7 's next fight for survival 2			2
@entity3 was hired in 2009 as a consultant by the @entity22 administration -- and paid nearly $ 400,000 -- for a year of his work			0
what 'd he do ? @entity3 has called it " technical support " and " analysis			2
" what he really did was take a bunch of numbers and model the effects of proposals that would later become the @entity7			2
" if they had n't had this kind of analysis , well , the law would not be designed as well , " @entity3 said on the @entity109 last year , discussing his work			1
at least eight states called him in to counsel them on how to implement the health care law and set up state - run health insurance exchanges			0
so he 's pretty important to @entity7			2
@entity120 but this guy is still calling voters stupid ! i vote			1
am i stupid ? no , you 're not stupid			0
at least we do n't think so			0
so why is he calling us voters stupid ? @entity128 's first look at what @entity3 actually said : he was defending the fact that the law was written behind closed doors and he said @entity45 intentionally made the law confusing to mask the fact that the law instituted a new tax to pay for health reform			1
why 'd the @entity45 do this ? voters do n't like new taxes			1
@entity3 said it was more important to get health reform than to be up front			0
" it 's a very clever , you know , basic exploitation of the lack of economic understanding of the @entity10 voter , " @entity3 said at the @entity143 2012 at the @entity144			2
and : " they proposed it and that passed , because the @entity10 people are too stupid to understand the difference , " he said at @entity150 at @entity151 in 2013			0
the brunt of @entity3 's argument is that policymakers crafting the law had to take politics into account			1
and politics means that politicians prefer to vote for a tax on insurance companies that will ultimately get passed on to consumers , rather than voting for a tax on consumers outright , for example			0
@entity3 's " stupid " comments are summed up his contention that people do n't want to pay more taxes , even when they want cheaper or better things			1
for instance : - want better public education ? - sure ! - want to pay higher taxes to improve public education ? - eh ... this also applies to voting for the individual mandate " penalty , " as the @entity22 administration refers to it , rather than a " tax , " as the @entity17 ruled in 2012			0
and it turns out that @entity3 always knew a tax on expensive insurance plans would eventually grow to hit almost every insurance plan			0
he admitted as much in yet another video that surfaced on friday			0
the @entity191 and @entity45 , by the way , promised up and down that the so - called " cadillac tax " would n't affect most @entity10			2
the guy who thinks voters are ' stupid ' but the controversy over whether the mandate is a " tax " is n't news , right ? nope			2
but it is giving @entity15 ' claims that the @entity22 administration misled voters on the " truth " of the @entity7 more credence			1
so why are @entity45 trying to distance themselves from @entity3 ? democrats clearly do n't want @entity7 tarnished anymore than it already has because of one guy			1
and they definitely do n't want him to be the face of @entity7 or @entity45 ' view on the law			1
what they 're trying to do is downplay @entity3 's role in crafting the law			1
on sunday , president @entity22 speaking from the @entity216 summit in @entity217 called him " some adviser who never worked on our staff			0
" minority leader @entity221 said @entity3 " did n't help write our bill " and claimed not to " know who he is			0
" she was n't being entirely up front on that point			0
@entity221 actually cited @entity3 's work approvingly in 2009 and even mentioned him by name in an interview that same year			1
@entity7 architect discussed misleading public in 4th newly uncovered video was @entity3 making a larger point here that we 're missing ? definitely			1
if you can get past his condescending tone and insults , @entity3 's speeches actually offer some insight into how policy is impacted by politics			1
" if you had a law which said healthy people are going to pay in -- if you made it explicit that healthy people pay in and sick people get money , it would not have passed , ok ? " @entity3 said			0
and while the ( impartial ) jury on the @entity7 is still out , the law has lowered that national uninsured rate and , so far , the law is proving to be cheaper than expected			0
either way , @entity3 has said he believes the @entity10 is better off with @entity7 than without it			2
and if less transparency helps implement better policy , he 's o.k. with that			0
but am i ? are you ? you make that call			0
third video emerges of @entity7 architect insulting voters			1

@entity3 called voters stupid , the @entity15 is calling him the @entity7 architect , and @entity45 are calling it all a misunderstanding
@entity3 played a crucial role in crafting the law and its @entity78 model , but is n't " the architect " of the law
@entity3 's " stupid " comments came as he *explained* the lack of transparency in selling the law to have it pass
the @entity15 is using this to prove voters were misled and @entity45 are trying to distance themselves from @entity3
