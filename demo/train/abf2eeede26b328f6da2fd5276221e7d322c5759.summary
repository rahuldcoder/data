the @entity2 plans to send small arms , ammunition and potentially anti-tank weapons to @entity7 's rebels , two officials familiar with the matter told @entity8 on friday			1
president @entity10 's administration has declined to provide details about increased military assistance for the rebels following its announcement thursday that @entity7 crossed a " red line " with its use of chemical weapons			1
@entity18 , a @entity2 deputy national security adviser , told reporters that @entity23 will " increase the size and scope of the assistance			2
" when pushed for more details , @entity18 said : " i ca n't give you a specific timeline or itemized list of what that assistance is			0
" the weapons will be provided by the @entity31 , the officials told @entity8 's chief @entity33 correspondent @entity32			1
the officials spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity surrounding the issue			0
the @entity2 announcement set off a series of claims and counterclaims in @entity7 and world capitals over the conflict that has claimed more than 90,000 lives with no sign of progress toward a political solution			2
@entity50 backed the @entity2 change in position , but @entity7 and its allies in @entity54 quickly sought to cast its integrity into doubt			1
the @entity7 foreign ministry accused @entity23 of releasing " a statement full of lies regarding the use of chemical weapons in @entity7 , " according to a statement released on state tv			1
and a government statement carried by the state - run @entity65 accused the @entity2 of using " flagrant tricks to come up with any possible means to justify the decision of president @entity10 to arm the @entity7 opposition			1
" an aide to @entity54 president @entity72 labeled as " unconvincing " the @entity2 evidence of chemical weapons use by @entity7			1
however , @entity50 foreign secretary @entity75 backed the @entity2 government 's assessment and called for a coordinated response from the international community			2
' weapons and ammunition ' @entity10 has been criticized at home and abroad for not acting sooner to assist the @entity7 opposition , and the declaration that the red line of chemical weapons use had been crossed raised expectations of @entity2 arms heading to the rebels			1
" what we need , really , is weapons and ammunition , and especially anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles , " gen. @entity89 of the rebel @entity90 told @entity8 's @entity91 on friday			1
@entity89 said he has not been told what type of weapons the @entity2 will provide to the rebel army			1
@entity98 , political and media coordinator of the rebel @entity90 , told @entity8 that he expected the @entity2 initially to send ammunition , rather than heavy arms			1
what complicates any @entity2 military support for the opposition is that many of the rebel fighters are militants with pro-al @entity107 sympathies , the same stripe of militants @entity2 has battled in @entity110 and @entity111			2
they include the @entity112 , a rebel group that the @entity2 says has links to @entity107			2
the rebels promised @entity2 and @entity116 officials that any military weaponry they get wo n't end up with extremists among the anti-government forces , @entity98 said			0
the officials told @entity8 that beyond small arms and ammunition , anti-tank weapons were also under consideration			1
they did not spell out what was being given to rebels , but small arms can include such items as rocket - propelled grenades , small rockets , mortars and mines as well as guns			2
anti-aircraft weapons were considered less likely , and @entity18 made clear friday that @entity10 has ruled out sending any @entity2 troops to @entity7			1
" the one option that we 've basically taken off the table is boots on the ground , " @entity18 said , adding that @entity10 has made the final decision on the step that " dramatically increases assistance to " rebel forces			2
' convincing ' evidence presidential aide @entity147 told reporters the @entity2 had shown @entity54 officials data and information on @entity7 's use of chemical weapons , @entity54 's state - run news agency @entity146 reported friday			1
" what we saw does not look convincing to us , " @entity147 was quoted as saying			0
in a telephone call with @entity2 secretary of state @entity158 , @entity54 foreign minister @entity156 said arming the rebels " would lead to an escalation in the region , since the @entity2 accusations that @entity163 has used chemical weapons are not rooted in reliable facts , " according to a statement released by the @entity167			1
@entity23 and @entity168 have been deeply divided over how to end the bloodshed in @entity7 , and the issue is expected to top the agenda when @entity10 and @entity72 meet for one - on - on talks monday at the start of @entity174 in the @entity50			1
" this is a fluid situation			0
so it is necessary for us to consult with leaders of the @entity174 about the types of support that we are providing for the opposition , " @entity18 said			0
asked about @entity54 's questioning of @entity2 evidence that @entity7 forces used chemical weapons multiple times , killing between 100 to 150 people , @entity18 said the information provided to @entity72 's government included samples of sarin gas and other " convincing " evidence			1
that evidence , according to @entity18 , includes intelligence reports , eyewitness accounts and " physiological samples " of the nerve agent sarin			0
no single piece of intelligence led to the conclusion that the @entity7 regime had used chemical weapons , said a senior administration official , who spoke on condition of anonymity			1
the official was not authorized to speak publicly on the matter			0
the finding , according to the official , was a result of looking at a number of instances of suspected use , seeing similar evidence and patterns of usage and coming to the conclusion chemical weapons had been used			2
@entity18 acknowledged the differences that remain between the @entity2 and @entity54 on the @entity7 crisis			1
the administration believes @entity222 's forces have used saran gas at least eight times in the more than two year conflict , said a @entity226 sourced briefed on the matter			0
a boost in support by the @entity2 for the rebels could put at risk the gains made by @entity7 forces in recent days , especially in central and northern @entity7 , with the help of @entity236 fighters from @entity237			2
in @entity163 , an @entity222 loyalist who spoke to @entity8 's @entity239 said he believes the @entity2 is " inventing stories " about the government 's use of chemical weapons " because our army is winning			1
" @entity245 : rebels losing fight the @entity33 announcement comes at a critical time for the @entity7 opposition , which has suffered a series of significant losses in recent weeks			0
those losses have coincided in large part with the arrival of thousands of @entity256 fighters , backed by @entity257 and @entity237 , to reinforce @entity222 's forces battling the mainly @entity259 uprising			0
after months of gaining ground , the rebels this month lost @entity262 -- one of their strongholds near the @entity257 border -- which was considered essential for the rebels ' supply route			0
until now , the @entity2 has limited its aid to rebels , providing communications equipment , medical supplies and food			0
@entity10 signed off on a new package of non-lethal aid in april			0
that assistance was expected to include body armor , night - vision goggles and other military equipment			0
sen. @entity245 , who has repeatedly pushed the @entity10 administration to step up its support for the rebels , told @entity8 on friday that they need anti-tank and anti-aircraft weapons			1
asked whether the rebels were losing the fight , the @entity284 @entity283 said : " absolutely , there 's no doubt about it			0
" he also called for taking out @entity222 's air assets to create a safe zone for the @entity7 opposition			2
" i know that we have the military capability to impose a ' no - fly ' zone , to crater their runways and their fixed installations where fuel and parts are , and establish a ' no - fly ' zone with @entity303 missiles , " @entity245 said			0
" and if we ca n't do that , then the question ought to be asked to the @entity2 taxpayer -- to the @entity307 , ' what in the world are we wasting tens of billions of dollars for defense for if we ca n't even take care of this situation ? ' " @entity245 said			0
@entity18 , however , indicated that a " no - fly " zone was unlikely , saying it would be " dramatically more difficult and dangerous and costly " to enforce one in @entity7 compared to the one @entity317 forces imposed with @entity2 backing during @entity320 's civil war			2
@entity320 rebels had control of large portions of the country , unlike the @entity7 rebels , he noted , and the @entity320 military had fewer air - defense systems			0
he added that a " no - fly " zone " is not a silver bullet			0
" @entity2 defense officials are not reviewing any new or updated options for a no - fly zone , two @entity307 sources said			2
even if @entity2 planes monitored a no - fly zone along the @entity7 - @entity338 border , the @entity7 regime could attack targets in southern @entity7 using long range artillery or scud missiles , a senior @entity307 official said			2
@entity7 's stockpile @entity7 has long maintained that rebels , not government forces , are behind the use of chemical weapons			1
it also went to the @entity348 with its claims , but @entity222 would not allow @entity348 inspectors into the country to try to verify the claims			0
analysts believe the @entity7 government may have one of the largest stockpiles of chemical weapons in the world			1
specifically , the supply is believed to include sarin , mustard and vx gases , which are banned under international law			0
@entity7 has denied the allegation			0
@entity366 gas can be hard to detect because it is colorless , odorless and tasteless			0
it can cause severe injuries -- including blurred vision , convulsions , paralysis and death -- to those exposed to it in recent months , reports have repeatedly surfaced that @entity7 forces have moved some of the chemical weapons inventories , possibly because of deteriorating security in the country , raising fears the stockpile could fall into the hands of @entity107 - linked groups working with the opposition should @entity222 's government fall			1
@entity2 officials have been closely monitoring @entity7 's chemical weapons stockpiles and are certain they remain in the control of @entity222 's regime , @entity18 said , adding that it would be too dangerous to destroy the chemical weapons stockpiles from afar			1
as recently as last week , the @entity393 foreign minister said sarin gas had been used several times in the @entity7 civil war , citing results from test samples in @entity393 's possession			0
in early may , the head of the @entity401 on @entity7 said that evidence points to the use of sarin by @entity7 rebel forces			0
but the commission later issued a news release saying it " has not reached conclusive findings as to the use of chemical weapons in @entity7 by any parties to the conflict			1

president @entity10 will meet with @entity54 's president on monday
a rebel general says he has not been told what type of weapons @entity2 will provide
the @entity31 will provide small arms and maybe anti-tank weapons , sources say
@entity7 accuses @entity2 of producing a " statement full of lies " on chemical weapons
