@entity0 -- @entity2 took the oath of office monday to become the 15th prime minister of @entity6			1
the swearing - in took place in a tightly guarded ceremony at the colonial - era presidential mansion in @entity0			0
for the first time , leaders of an entire @entity13 region attended , including @entity15 , the prime minister of @entity6 's traditional archrival , @entity17			1
but it 's not just the guest list that makes this inauguration historic			2
never in the past three decades has a political party taken up the reins of the world 's largest democracy with an absolute majority			2
and never before has a provincial chief with no federal experience become head of a national government			0
unprecedented invitation in attendance on the sprawling forecourt of the sandstone palace were the premiers of @entity17 , @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38 ; the presidents of @entity40 , @entity41 and the @entity42 ; and the speaker of @entity44 , officials say			1
" a promising gesture , " read the headline of an editorial in the @entity47 on friday about @entity6 's unprecedented invitation to the leaders of the @entity51 bloc			1
until his election to @entity56 this month , @entity2 , a chief minister of the prosperous northwestern state of @entity54 , has been seen as hawkish by some political watchers , especially over relations with nuclear archrival @entity17			1
his @entity61 nationalist @entity60 has often accused the administration of outgoing prime minister @entity63 of being soft on its western neighbor , which @entity0 blames for a number of terror attacks in @entity6 , including the deadly 2008 assault in @entity69			1
both countries have fought three wars , two of them over the @entity74 region of @entity75 , which both claim as their own in its entirety			0
an editorial in the @entity47 said @entity2 's " terrific " move to invite regional leaders " should help generate a more realistic appreciation of @entity6 's foreign - policy trajectory in the coming years			1
" " what matters in the end , however , is the prospect of a more self - assured government in @entity0 that is ready to engage the neighbors without standing on protocol and precedent , " it added			0
economic hope credited for his pro-business approach as the chief of @entity54 , @entity6 's new leader has also raised expectations that his government will succeed in turning around @entity6 's slowing economy , generate more jobs and rein in soaring prices and deeply entrenched corruption , issues that are widely believed to have brought about the fall of @entity63 's government			0
@entity2 's party won 282 seats of the 543 - seat lower house of @entity56 on its own , the first independent win by any single political party in three decades			1
@entity6 has since been ruled by coalitions of national and regional groupings with varied political and economic philosophies			2
" the @entity60 's single - handed majority in the new parliament ensures at least one thing : no more excuses of fractured coalition politics compromising policies and reforms , " said @entity113 , @entity115 's chief @entity114 economist , in a column in the @entity47			0
" more growth , more employment , more infrastructure , lower inflation is just motherhood and apple pie			0
identifying and articulating the binding constraints holding these back is the heart of the problem , " he wrote			0
political analysts also describe the debacle of @entity63 's @entity138 government as a vote against crushing prices			2
" moderation in prices of essential commodities is a potential challenge for @entity2 's government in a market - driven economy , " political commentator @entity141 said			1
" the honeymoon period will not last longer if measures are not taken in the next 100 days to bring costs down , " he added			0
@entity2 's @entity152 , observers say , will signify his government 's model and course			2
" it has to be a dream team that balances demands and side effects of growth with promises of low prices to millions of poverty - stricken @entity6			0
it has to be a smart mix of youth and experience with a cohesive approach			0
with pressures of coalition politics no longer there , the last thing @entity6 would expect the new prime minister 's core team to be is a chariot pulled by horses running in different directions , " @entity141 said			1
friend or foe ? @entity6 's @entity2 an unknown quantity abroad securing @entity6 's energy a major challenge for new @entity182 memo to @entity2 : how to reboot @entity6			2
