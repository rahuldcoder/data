it 's been a tough month for the " @entity2			0
" its fighters were finally driven out of the @entity6 border town of @entity7 after more than 100 days of fighting against @entity9 militia ; @entity11 government forces pushed @entity12 back in @entity13 ; the city of @entity15 -- still under @entity12 control -- is beginning to look vulnerable			1
and airstrikes have taken a toll on the group 's infrastructure and field commanders			0
its ability to win the release of a jailed jihadist in @entity26 or the ability of its followers in @entity30 to attack a @entity32 hotel may provide brief propaganda boons , but they do n't affect the fundamentals on the ground			0
nor will its attempts to export terror to @entity39			0
but lest anyone declare victory , predictions of @entity12 ' demise are wildly optimistic			2
@entity12 still controls some 50,000 square kilometers of @entity11 as well as up to 30 % of @entity6 territory and at least 10 % of its population			1
to the west of @entity48 , it is still on the offensive in @entity50 , and recently raided checkpoints on the @entity11 - @entity53 border			2
@entity55 spokesman rear admiral @entity54 said last week : " we 're only six to seven months into this thing ...			0
this is going to be a long struggle			0
" a senior official at the @entity61 echoed @entity54 's line this week , saying @entity12 ' expulsion from @entity7 is part of the " early phase of a multi-year campaign			1
" @entity12 is " a very adaptive organization , " the official said -- and terms like " turning point " were to be avoided			2
even so , there 's quite a contrast between september , when @entity73 officials said the fall of @entity7 to @entity12 seemed inevitable , and @entity75 celebrating on the city 's streets this week			1
@entity12 chose @entity7 as a symbol of its virility , even sending hostage @entity80 there to make a video about the group 's inevitable victory			1
@entity7 was a recruitment poster in @entity12 ' efforts to draw more foreign fighters to the @entity88			1
@entity12 continued to reinforce its presence in the town despite constant airstrikes			2
general @entity92 , @entity73 coordinator of the campaign against @entity12 , said in november that the group had " impaled itself " on @entity7			1
the @entity61 official said @entity12 ' losses there -- likely running into four figures -- could help counter the messaging that has attracted foreign fighters			1
" a narrative of inevitable glory and conquest " had been replaced by images of bodies left on the streets , the official said			0
a growing number of those foreign fighters may also be disillusioned after several months of airstrikes			0
setbacks in @entity7 and elsewhere have led to a stream of deserters , dozens of whom have been executed according to local activists cited by the @entity6 observatory on @entity115			1
analysts say one trend in coming months may be a stream of disillusioned foreigners trying to escape @entity12 territory			2
in @entity11 a leading expert on @entity12 , @entity122 , told @entity1 that @entity12 has now lost ground in several areas and needs to regroup			1
@entity125 , a senior analyst at consultancy @entity126 , agrees that @entity12 is on the back foot in @entity11 , relying more on classic insurgency tactics such as roadside bombs and unable to move in force because of the threat of airstrikes			1
among its latest reverses , @entity12 has lost control over a number of villages in the province of @entity13 , north - east of @entity48			2
@entity11 troops and @entity140 militia known as @entity141 launched an offensive last week to retake @entity12 ' last strongholds around @entity144 -- 50 miles ( 80km ) from the capital			1
according to @entity11 commanders , the whole province of @entity13 is now back in government hands , after several months of intermittent battles			1
@entity125 says it became increasingly difficult for @entity12 to sustain its supply lines in the region			2
the key prize for all sides in @entity11 remains @entity15 , a city of 1.5 million people on the @entity156 , held by @entity12 since last june			1
@entity12 has invested heavily in governing the city ; its leader @entity159 pronounced his leadership of the @entity88 at the @entity161 there last july			2
for their part , @entity9 officials say that as long as @entity12 holds @entity15 , it threatens @entity75			2
likewise , neither the government in @entity48 nor its coalition partners can rest while terrorists occupy @entity11 's second - largest city			2
@entity169 forces have made steady progress against @entity12 north and west of @entity15 over the last two months			2
they have taken some 3,000 square kilometers of the @entity175 area , as well as the area around the @entity15 dam , choking off access routes and threatening @entity12 ' main resupply route to @entity6			1
to the south , @entity11 forces ' gains around @entity182 have also restricted @entity12 ' freedom of movement			1
the @entity185 ( @entity185 ) , which studies military activity in @entity11 and @entity6 , says @entity12 is preparing to dig a defensive trench around @entity15 , and has blown up a bridge on a key western approach			1
@entity185 also reports an increase in executions by @entity12 across @entity193 province , where @entity15 is located , which it sees as further evidence " @entity12 is feeling pressured by internal resistance in the province			2
" ( there is anecdotal evidence of resistance across the border in @entity6 too ; a senior @entity12 police official who had supervised executions was himself found beheaded in @entity203 early in january			1
) there had been talk of a january offensive to retake @entity15 , but any assault now seems many weeks away			0
@entity54 told @entity1 's @entity208 tuesday that the timing could not be predicted " but obviously we 're working closely with @entity11 security forces on helping them better understand the challenges " of an assault on @entity15			2
@entity11 units are already fully occupied elsewhere -- notably in @entity50 province , where @entity12 threatens @entity216 and other areas			1
an assault on @entity15 would have to be meticulously co-ordinated from several different directions , informed by good intelligence and supported from the air			0
a massive intelligence - gathering effort is already under way , according to analysts			0
even so , @entity15 's remaining residents are predominantly @entity226 and would be wary of @entity9 and @entity140 militia , so regular forces from the reconstituted @entity11 army would likely have to take the lead			0
the recent history of urban warfare in @entity11 should give pause , analysts say , recalling the brutal battles to evict @entity236 from @entity237 in 2004			0
@entity125 says an uprising from within is much preferable to an assault from without , and some observers predict any operation to retake @entity15 would n't happen until early summer			0
another problem for @entity12 is that coalition airstrikes and ground operations by @entity11 and @entity169 forces appear to be whittling away @entity12 ' commanders -- even if claims by some @entity73 officials that half of @entity12 ' leadership has been taken out appear optimistic			1
among prominent casualties reported by @entity11 and @entity9 officials in the past two months are @entity12 ' governor for @entity50 province , @entity256 , and @entity257 , a member of @entity12 ' @entity259 , its highest policy - making body			1
@entity125 says some of @entity12 ' most seasoned fighters have also left @entity11 -- some returning to @entity30 , for example			1
more importantly , he says , there is only a finite pool of skilled military commanders -- some of them former officers in @entity269 's army , and " they will have a problem replacing them " if they are killed			0
even where @entity12 suffers defeat , there is no guarantee the @entity11 government can secure and hold territory			1
the prominent role of @entity140 militia may yet make it difficult for @entity48 to pacify areas after @entity12 retreats			1
during the @entity13 offensive , the militia killed some 70 @entity226 civilians , a local member of @entity288 , @entity287 , told @entity289			0
others claimed the militia had burned down houses and mosques			0
the @entity294 denied the claims , but it 's not the first time these militia have been accused of atrocities during military offensives -- and that may weaken the readiness of @entity226 tribes to help the government against @entity12			0
the @entity11 government has proposed bringing the militia under the umbrella of a @entity306			0
oil minister @entity307 wrote on his @entity309 page that it would " be possible to organize the [ @entity140 ] @entity141 forces , the [ @entity226 ] @entity310 and the @entity169 under the umbrella of the @entity306 , knowing that the main goal of the latter is to prevent the emergence of militias , put all the weapons under the supervision of the state and provide backup forces when needed			0
" but there is plenty of resistance to the idea because such militia have often been the best guarantee of a community 's security			0
in areas it liberates , the @entity11 government will have to provide security , rehabilitation and effective governance to people who -- with good reason -- do n't believe @entity48 can provide any of the above			2
@entity12 also benefits from being able to use both @entity6 and @entity11 territory as the battlefield shifts			1
while under pressure in northern @entity11 , its forces can regroup across the border in @entity6 's @entity341 province			1
it can also use the frontier from @entity203 into @entity11 's @entity50 province , " where it enjoys real strategic depth and the @entity11 army struggles with long supply lines , " says @entity125			0
it has even begun to probe the @entity11 - @entity53 border			0
@entity12 also controls a number of small oil fields and an arsenal of weaponry captured in both @entity11 and @entity6			1
and it still has money			0
@entity11 finance minister @entity354 told @entity289 he estimates @entity12 has looted $ 456 million from banks in @entity15 , @entity356 and @entity182 since june			1
and it has set up a rudimentary taxation system in the main cities it controls , as well as a fearsome intelligence apparatus			0
but @entity12 is finding the job of controlling much harder than that of attacking			0
it has needed an expensive and labor - intensive mix of coercion , intimidation and policing to run @entity15 , where the @entity11 government still pays the bulk of state employees ' salaries			0
under pressure on several fronts , " @entity12 now has to think very carefully about where it puts its forces , " says @entity125			0
@entity1 's @entity208 , @entity375 and @entity376 contributed to this report .			0

@entity12 fighters have been driven out of @entity7 in @entity6 and pushed back in @entity11
but the group still controls large areas of @entity11 and @entity6
experts say the fight against @entity12 is likely to take several years
