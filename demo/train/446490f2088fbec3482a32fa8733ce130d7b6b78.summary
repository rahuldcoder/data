@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 is the @entity1 supermodel and philanthropist described by designer @entity5 as " the most beautiful woman in the world			1
" @entity3 : " i think protecting your family and giving to them is the most important achievement			1
" @entity3 , 27 , is a mother of three and has set up her own children 's charity			1
the woman nicknamed " @entity15 " tells my city_my life about her tough childhood , her love of @entity0 and why @entity1 vodka is the best			1
@entity2 : how would you describe @entity0 ? @entity3 : it 's a city of contrasts			1
you have this great culture and traditions that are very normal , calm and established			0
and then you have explosions of emotion , craziness , art , and young people who are so proud to be @entity0 and really trying to be individuals			1
@entity0 is a huge inspiration for me			1
i love what i find here , i love being here			1
@entity2 : what would you change about @entity0 given the chance ? @entity38 : definitely the way it 's treated at the moment , the way the government wants to renovate the old buildings			1
to me it 's a little bit sad because in the @entity47 people have a very different mentality about renovating buildings , keeping them as intact as possible			2
watch @entity3 take @entity2 on a tour of @entity0			1
» @entity2 : what 's the fashion in @entity0 ? @entity38 : you see women in jeans wearing very high heels and a short puffy jacket			1
it 's really funny ! @entity2 : tell me about your childhood @entity38 : i was born in @entity62 to a very poor family and unfortunately my father and mother separated when i was very little			2
she was a single mum and had two more girls			0
it was a struggle but we all worked really hard and stood up for each other			0
my mum was amazing ; she never drank , she never smoked -- she lived for us			0
i appreciate what she has done for me and the way she raised me			0
@entity2 : is family very important to you ? @entity38 : i think protecting your family and giving to them is so important			0
it 's the most important achievement			2
@entity2 : how did your modeling career take off ? @entity38 : i went to @entity81 when i was 17			0
i was lucky because my career kind of gradually built up over two years -- i always had good work but i was n't a star straight away			0
in fact , my agency thought that i might never do shows because i was a bit shorter and not skinny enough , but when i gave birth to my first son i was 19 and i lost a lot of weight			0
i guess the stress on the body was extreme and i suddenly just turned into this stick -- just the way designers love models			2
my career took off after @entity99 was born because i opened a lot of shows on the runway and that 's where a lot of stars are made in my industry			0
see @entity3 's @entity0 in photos			1
» @entity2 : if you were n't a model , what would your life be like ? @entity38 : it 's very hard to say what my life would be like if i had n't gone to @entity81			0
people say i did n't change very much but i do n't think that 's true			0
i 'm a happy person and even if i thought that i was happy then , i had so much baggage to carry with me : my background , people 's expectations , the fact that i was n't a perfect student and i was n't going to school all the time -- i did n't live a normal life at all			0
that 's not with me anymore , because of my success			0
it really does n't matter because i know i have learned so much more than a lot of other girls who have had perfect childhoods			0
@entity2 : tell us about the charity and what you are trying to achieve with it ? @entity38 : i started my foundation in 2005 , after the @entity138 tragedy [ the 2004 school siege in which at least 339 hostages were killed ]			2
i was in @entity0 at the time and it just struck me so much			2
i went back to @entity143 , where i was living at the time , organized a fundraising event and raised $ 350,000 to build a playground for the children that had survived in the area			0
i believe that play is very therapeutic			0
it 's really the only way for these children to forget about what happened and just be children , even if it 's only for five minutes			2
but then i realized that it would be good for all the other children in @entity1 and i just started raising money and building playgrounds			1
now we have 23 places all over @entity1 and we are building 15 more this year and planning to build more			1
i want to fulfill my dream of building 500 play parks in @entity1			1
each one will cost about $ 300,000 so it 's a big dream -- an expensive one ! @entity2 : let 's talk about vodka ... @entity38 : our vodka is definitely the best			2
it 's a very pure , good drink and it goes with @entity1 food			1
generally i do n't drink vodka outside @entity1 , but when you come to @entity1 there is no reason to order a glass of wine			2
@entity2 : what do you think of your nickname -- supernova ? @entity38 : i do n't mind being called @entity15			0
if one nickname is going to stick , that 's not a bad one ! @entity2 : which five words best describe @entity0 ? @entity38 : it 's mysterious , cultural , exciting , crazy and spiritual .			1
