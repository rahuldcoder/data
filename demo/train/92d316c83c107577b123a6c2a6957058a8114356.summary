@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity3 might be @entity1 's wine capital -- renowned around the world as the home of some of the country 's most famous labels -- but not far from @entity12 's fertile vineyards there 's another drink brewing up a storm			1
inspired by an international boom for local , independent microbreweries , the business of craft beer has also taken off in @entity1 recently , as growing numbers of small producers are experimenting with styles and techniques to satisfy a rising thirst for new flavors and novel brews			1
" there is a massive demand , " says @entity26 , co-founder of @entity28 's @entity27 , just one of the several microbreweries to come out of @entity0 in recent times			2
" we started off in a garage , from there we bought our own 500 - liter system and now we are in this new 1,500 - liter system , " he adds			0
" constantly , our biggest challenge has been keeping up with the demand			0

@entity51 is a subsidiary of @entity52 , the world 's second - largest brewer , and accounts for more than 90 % of the country 's beer market			2
but the smaller players have also started making a mark			2
almost three decades after @entity1 's first microbrewery , @entity0 - based @entity59 , opened its doors in the early 1980s , estimates suggest that today there more than 50 microbreweries across the country , a figure that 's doubled in the last few years			1
" on a top level , the big beer companies are supporting craft beer because it helps bring more people to beer , " says @entity66 , founder of @entity67 , an online store offering local and international craft beers to enthusiasts in @entity1 he adds , however , that craft beer still has a long way to go before it can take on the mass beer producers			1
" on the ground level , it 's always going to be tight competition and as a craft brewer you 're never going to be able to win out against one of the big brewers unless you , the consumer , asks specifically for those beers , " adds @entity66			0

" beer drinker @entity141 agrees			0
" i really prefer craft beer to the standard commercial stuff that you get , " he says			1
" the variety that 's available , the different range of flavors that you can get , it 's just something that a mass - produced beer i do n't think will be able to give , " he adds			2
" you can tell that people put love into it and there 's a bit more attention given to the product than with a mass produced			0
" it 's that kind of care that craft beer makers hope will keep consumers coming back for more			1
