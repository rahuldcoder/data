@entity0 -- it took five days for president @entity3 to address the controversy he caused by saying " we do n't have a strategy yet " to defeat @entity7			1
wednesday , the president attempted to clarify what he meant by specifying that he was referring to @entity7 inside @entity10 while highlighting the @entity12 strategy in @entity13 of airstrikes to weaken the extremist terror group that calls itself the @entity16			1
" it is very important from my perspective that when we send our pilots in to do a job -- that we know that this is a mission that 's going to work ; that we 're very clear what our objectives are , what our targets are , " @entity3 said during a joint news conference with @entity21 prime minister @entity20 on the first day of his trip to @entity23 for @entity25 meetings			1
@entity3 went further , saying that before the @entity12 acts in @entity10 , the administration must have " made the case to the @entity12 people and ( make sure ) we 've got allies behind us so that it 's not just a one - off , but it 's something that over time is going to be effective			1
" in other words , the president wants to engage coalition partners , create a meaningful military plan and explain it to the public			0
he also said he might need approval from @entity48			0
who is @entity7 ? so why did that take so long to respond to that rare moment of candor that resulted in ongoing criticism from every corner of the political spectrum and provide another opportunity for critics to define his foreign policy as feckless and aimless ? dr. @entity60 , senior researcher at the @entity61 , said @entity3 's slow response to his critics is characteristic of his approach to foreign policy			1
" slowly he 's getting there , " said @entity60 , an @entity13 expert who has been warning about the growing threat of @entity7 and is critical of the president 's " cautious " approach to @entity7 in @entity13			1
he wants strategic , limited and immediate airstrikes in @entity10			0
" the gravity of the situation is filtering through and i think that 's progress			0
" @entity75 : @entity12 to pursue @entity7 killers ' to the gates of hell ' the president again fell victim to that perception again wednesday			1
during that same news conference in @entity21 , @entity3 gave mixed messages of @entity12 goals against the group that effectively erased the border between @entity13 and @entity10			1
on one hand he said the goal is to " degrade and destroy , " then appeared to move back from the " destroy " part of the phrase by saying the goal against @entity7 is to ensure the group is " manageable			2
" it is another instance that opens him up to criticism from those who want aggressive military action as well as confusion on the part of an @entity12 public that wants answers			2
" he left a little ambiguous what the goal is today , " @entity101 , a former adviser to four presidents , said wednesday on @entity1			0
an administration official defended the president , saying he did not deliver two conflicting messages , but noted that this is going to be a time - consuming fight that will begin with managing @entity7 's threat and eventually lead to its destruction			0
now that this is the second messaging problem the president has had in less than a week when talking about the terrorist group , major gen. @entity114 said the president 's missives must be more clear			0
" words are very , very important , " @entity114 said on @entity1 , adding that his messages are mixed because the @entity12 's lack of a strategy			2
regardless of messaging , the president 's restrained strategy does have its defenders			0
@entity125 , host of @entity1 's " gps , " said that the president 's response to @entity7 in @entity10 , which is embroiled in a three - year long civil war , is appropriate			2
he said one important consideration is whether the brutal regime of @entity10 president @entity132 would be strengthened if @entity7 is defeated there			0
" in the @entity138 , the enemy of your enemy is still your enemy , " @entity125 said on @entity1 's " @entity134 " on wednesday			0
the external pressure put on @entity3 to act is harmful , @entity125 said			0
" this is where the media pressure actually is unhelpful to having a strong foreign policy , " he said			1
after @entity7 beheaded @entity12 journalist @entity146 , the second @entity12 in less than one month , @entity145 columnist @entity144 wrote that caution is the president 's ally because @entity7 's actions are " meant to get us to overreact			1
" the president will begin to mold his strategy at the @entity25 summit where he will attempt to organize a coalition to address @entity7 in @entity10			2
and next week , @entity48 is back in @entity0 where debate about @entity12 response to @entity7 is expected			1
opinion : why @entity3 needs to be the explainer in chief @entity1 's @entity161 contributed to this report			0

@entity3 addresses his " we do n't have a strategy yet " to defeat @entity7 five days later
@entity3 said he wants to " clear what our objectives are " and to make " the case " to @entity12
one expert said his *delayed* response is characteristic of his approach to foreign policy : slow
