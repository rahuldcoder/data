-- if the moon looks a little bit bigger and brighter this weekend , there 's a reason for that			1
saturday 's full moon will be a super " perigee moon " -- the biggest in almost 20 years			1
this celestial event is far rarer than the famed blue moon , which happens once about every two - and - a - half years			0
" the last full moon so big and close to @entity15 occurred in march of 1993 , " said @entity11 with the @entity12 in @entity13			1
" i 'd say it 's worth a look			0
" full moons look different because of the elliptical shape of the moon 's orbit			0
when it 's at perigee , the moon is about 31,000 miles ( 50,000 km ) closer to @entity15 than when it 's at the farthest point of its orbit , also known as apogee			2
" nearby perigee moons are about 14 % bigger and 30 % brighter than lesser moons that occur on the apogee side of the moon 's orbit , " the @entity31 website says			1
this full moon will rise in the east at sunset and should look especially big at that time because of what 's known as the " moon illusion			2
" " for reasons not fully understood by astronomers or psychologists , low - hanging moons look unnaturally large when they beam through trees , buildings and other foreground objects , " according to @entity31			0
@entity48 : share your photos even though it may look close enough to touch , saturday 's full moon will still be at a healthy distance -- some 211,600 miles ( 356,577 km ) away			1
as rare as it is , it may be worth a look			0
@entity57 it and you 'll have to wait until 2029 to see it again .			0
