-- @entity3 died of lung cancer , but the singer was n't a smoker , and the cancer was n't related to smoking , her family 's representative said friday			1
summer 's family issued the announcement in the wake of how " various reports currently surfacing about the cause of ms. @entity3 's death are not accurate , " representative @entity9 said			1
" obviously , numerous factors can be attributed to the cause of cancer in general , but any details regarding the diagnosis and subsequent treatment of ms. @entity3 's case remain between her family and team of doctors , " @entity17 said in a statement			1
five - time @entity30 winner @entity3 , 63 , known as the " queen of disco " during the 1970s , died thursday at age 63			1
summer : a diva who defined the disco movement much like the expressive era that her music defined , @entity3 danced her way through the 1970s with extraordinary success , posting successive hits that electrified dance floors and prompted her coronation as @entity45 's disco queen			1
but her own life was marked by the highs and lows of the ballads that she energetically sang , and even at the height of her popularity , she once took steps toward suicide -- only to be stopped by the interruption of hotel maids			2
she overcame the negative dimensions of relentless public attention , and her legacy as a genre - leading vocalist endures decades later among music enthusiasts , even resulting in an appearance a few years ago on " @entity62			2
" @entity3 died surrounded by her family in @entity64			1
overheard on @entity0 : this ' last dance ' goes out to @entity3 said her family in a statement thursday : " early this morning , we lost @entity69 , a woman of many gifts , the greatest being her faith			1
while we grieve her passing , we are at peace celebrating her extraordinary life and her continued legacy			2
" @entity3 , who was born in @entity76 and whose father was a butcher and mother a schoolteacher , sang from the moment she learned to talk , and her debut performance came in church at age 10 when the scheduled singer did n't show and the pastor asked @entity3 to step in			1
@entity3 later recalled that the church performance left worshipers in tears			1
while she is iconic in the disco genre , her @entity30 wins were also in the r&b , rock , inspirational and dance categories			2
" her talent was a true gift to the music industry , " said @entity94 , president and ceo of the @entity96			2
at the height of her career , she and @entity100 created a sex symbol persona for her , and in an october 1977 cover story for @entity105 , she remarked about her other nicknames : @entity107 of @entity108			0
" well , you have to get people 's attention some kind of way , " @entity3 told the magazine , " but i 'm not just sex , sex , sex			1
i would never want to be a one - dimensional person like that			0
" i can sing songs like ' @entity121 , ' but i can also sing ballads , light opera , things from musical comedies , church hymns -- all kinds of things			0
plus i can write , act and think			0
" listen to a playlist of @entity3 's greatest hits @entity3 added that she did n't " want to be known for just one thing			1
" in a 2003 interview with @entity0 , she said the initial absence of a manager led her to do provocative photo shoots			0
her public image as a sex symbol and diva conflicted with her religious upbringing , she said			0
her grandfather was a minister and her father a church deacon			0
" yes , it was a big complex and the image was sort of created around me , " @entity3 said			1
" i was sort of there , but not consciously there			0
and i did n't have anybody sort of on my side at that point , fighting for me , except for me , being in the middle			2
and then people would say , you know , ' @entity154 down here and do this			0
' and you know , whatever , " @entity3 said			1
her big break came when she was a teenager and auditioned in @entity159 for a @entity161 version of " hair			0
" she landed a role and went to @entity161			0
when she achieved success by her mid- 20s , she was n't able to handle it well			2
" it was tough , " @entity3 said			1
" i think success is always a surprise , you know			0
" she eventually suffered depression and found herself in an abusive relationship			0
" if people are in abusive relationships , i think they need to get out of them or at least get help , " @entity3 said			1
she lived in fear during that relationship , she said			0
" thank @entity177 this person was from @entity161 , so they were deported			0
and then i was able to sort of be free , but i was afraid for years , " she said			0
her hits included " @entity181 , " " @entity182 " and " @entity183			0
" summer rose to fame the mid- 1970s , thanks to " @entity187			0
" the song , with @entity3 's whispered vocals and orgasmic groans supported by heavily synthesized backing tracks , fueled the decade 's disco mania and hit no. 2 in 1976			1
summer followed the song with such hits as " @entity198 , " " @entity199 " and a disco version of the @entity201 hit " @entity202 , " which outdid @entity201 ' version by hitting no. 1 on @entity205 's hot 100 singles chart			2
it was @entity3 's first of four chart - toppers			1
but with her 1979 album " @entity182 , " @entity3 broke out of the disco mold as the genre , stimulated by the success of the @entity215 ' " @entity216 " soundtrack , was feeling a backlash			1
" @entity182 " demonstrated @entity3 's vocal and stylistic range and produced two no. 1 hits , " @entity181 " and " @entity182 , " as well as a @entity221 ballad , " @entity222			1
" however , @entity3 had some trouble adjusting to the changing times			2
her next album , " @entity226 , " went for more of a rock feel			0
it produced a top 10 hit in the title track but fared relatively poorly on the charts -- especially disappointing after the success of " bad girls , " a double album that spent five weeks at no. 1			0
it was n't until 1983 's " @entity183 , " which became a ubiquitous video as well as a big radio hit , that @entity3 's fame approached its late - ' 70s zenith			1
@entity0 's @entity241 and @entity242 contributed to this report .			2
