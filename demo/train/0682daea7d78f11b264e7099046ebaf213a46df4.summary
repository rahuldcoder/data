-- anti-establishment candidates are capitalizing on widespread anti-incumbent fervor and proposing term limits as a way to bring the power back to the people			1
as political hopefuls try to persuade voters to send them to @entity9 , they 're also promising they wo n't be there long			2
@entity14 @entity13 @entity12 candidate @entity11 said that if elected , he ca n't see himself serving more than two terms			0
in @entity18 , @entity17 congressional hopeful @entity16 has proposed a 12 - year cap in the @entity20 and @entity12			0
and in @entity22 , @entity13 @entity21 has assured voters that , should he go to the @entity20 , he 'll be out of there by 2023			0
it 's a message that polls well and gets applause at campaign rallies , but @entity29 , director of @entity31 's program for @entity32 of the @entity9 , said term limits do more harm than good			1
" it 's political junk food			0
it tastes good but hurts the body politic in the long run , " he said			0
advocates and opponents of term limits are after the same thing : keeping the power out of the hands of lobbyists and special interests			1
@entity29 says term limits do the opposite by taking the business of lawmaking away from elected representatives and giving it to professional staff and lobbyists			1
instead , the elections process needs better campaign finance laws and a more engaged electorate , he said			0
" that leads to a situation in which we reward politicians or statesmen or stateswoman who have been around for a long time and are terrific , while at the same time being able to get rid of the low - quality legislators at all levels , " @entity29 said			2
but @entity67 , president of @entity68 , points to the high re-election rates as evidence of the need for term limits			1
re-election rates have hovered around 96 percent in the @entity20 and 85 percent in the @entity12 over the past 10 years , according to the @entity74			1
the average length of service for lawmakers in the current session of @entity9 is 5.5 terms in the @entity20 and 2.2 terms in the @entity12 , according to the @entity81			2
" you have a situation where you have a long - standing relationship between special interests and an incumbent who ca n't lose , and that is a toxic combination , and that 's most of the @entity9 , " @entity67 said			1
" term limits ensure regular , competitive elections			1
" it 's a debate as old as the @entity93 that term - limit supporters hope to amend			2
@entity95 spoke against limits , writing in @entity97 72 that , " nothing appears more plausible at first sight , nor more ill - founded upon close inspection			2
" @entity102 , however , said term limitation , at least of the president , was necessary " to prevent every danger which might arise to @entity107 freedom from continuing too long in office			0
" after the @entity93 was drafted , @entity102 said one aspect he disliked was " the abandonment in every instance of the necessity of rotation in office , and most particularly in the case of the president			0
" " if you value rotation in office , like the founders did , we need some kind of codified term limits , " @entity67 said			1
fifteen states have term limits for state lawmakers			1
another six states have agreed to term limits in the past , but the limits were repealed by the legislature or overturned by the courts , according to the @entity132			1
most of the states with term limits got them through a ballot initiative , a process that only 24 states have			2
@entity140 , who tracks term limits for the @entity132 , said that while voters are generally supportive of term limits , some studies have shown negative effects that are n't obvious to the average voter , such as a loss of influence in the legislature to the executive branch and a loss of policy champions who spend years building expertise in certain subjects			2
" they 're sort of inside the legislature , under - the - dome kind of things that people who are close to the legislature notice ... but no legislature has had to go out of business because term limits wrecked them , so it 's not stuff that is visible to voters , " she said			1
the new wave of calls for term limits is reminiscent of the lead - up to the 1994 elections			1
armed with a legislative agenda called the " contract with @entity107 , " @entity13 put forth a message with an emphasis on term limits			2
the @entity13 took back control of the @entity20 and @entity12 for the first time in nearly 50 years , and , for the first time ever , the @entity20 voted on legislation that would limit representatives to six two - year terms and senators to two six - year terms			0
the vote was 227 -- 204 -- a simple majority , but not the two - thirds required for a constitutional amendment			1
at the time , 23 states had passed laws imposing term limits on their federal lawmakers , but in may of 1995 , two months after the @entity20 vote , the @entity193 ruled that doing so was unconstitutional			1
" allowing individual states to adopt their own qualifications for congressional service would be inconsistent with the @entity199 ' vision of a uniform @entity200 representing the people of the @entity107			0
if the qualifications set forth in the text of the @entity93 are to be changed , that text must be amended , " justice @entity202 wrote			0
in order to pass a constitutional amendment on term limits , the @entity20 and @entity12 would have to pass legislation with a two - thirds majority , and then three - fourths of the state legislatures would have to ratify it			1
@entity214 @entity213 sen. @entity213 introduced a bill to limit lawmakers to six years in the @entity20 and 12 years in the @entity12			0
@entity213 's bill has yet to come up for a vote , but for @entity67 , the outlook is good			0
" there are periods in history where term limits are at the fore , and if the people of the country want them and demand them now , we have as good a chance as any that we ever had to have them			2
so it 's an exciting time , " he said			0
but @entity29 says that even if the idea had the support of the president and @entity9 , he is confident that the @entity107 public would reject it			0
" the evidence after 20 years of this in state legislatures is crystal clear : term limits empower special interests , lobbyists and long - time staffers and they work against the interests of the @entity107 people , " he said			1
the reason the issue polls well , @entity29 said , is because there has n't been a vigorous dialogue about it			0
" people are reacting by their instinct and anger , which is understandable			0
but sometimes instinct and anger take us in the wrong direction , " he said .			0

some candidates making term limits a *key* part of their platforms
it would require a constitutional amendment to enact limits on federal lawmakers
opponent says term limits hand power to special interests , long - time staffers
advocate says high re-election rates are proof @entity9 needs term limits
