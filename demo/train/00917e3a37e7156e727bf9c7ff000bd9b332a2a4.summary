@entity0 , @entity1 -- as a co-author of an @entity6 history textbook that was effectively banned in @entity7 eight years ago , i get a strong feeling of déjà vu all over again as i follow the state 's latest curricular wars			1
historians and teachers have reason to be deeply concerned over the latest actions taken by the @entity16 regarding social studies curriculum standards			0
the board has moved aggressively to put its hard - right conservative stamp on what students need to learn about the @entity6 past			1
among the changes made by the board was the elimination of @entity25 from a list of thinkers who had inspired revolutions around the world			0
conservatives object to @entity25 's support for a clear separation of church and state			0
this trend is troubling in terms of the writing and the teaching of @entity6 history			1
in 2002 , the school board , egged on by well - funded conservative organizations , excluded " out of many : @entity41 , " ostensibly for an offensive passage discussing prostitution on the @entity45 frontier			1
but the real reason became clear as that dispute played out , and i think that it helps explain what 's happening today			0
many conservatives are simply unwilling to accept how much the writing and teaching of @entity6 history has changed over the past 40 years			1
they want an @entity6 history that ignores or marginalizes african - americans , women , latinos , immigrants and popular culture			1
rather than genuinely engaging the fundamental conflicts that have shaped our past , they prefer a celebratory history that denies those fundamental conflicts			2
conservative textbook activists believe that somehow what they call the " revisionist " history of recent decades needs to be " balanced			1
" hence their insistence that , for example , textbooks stress the superiority of @entity6 " free enterprise " -- they think the word " capitalism " is too negative			2
and they insist books stress , as school board chairman @entity79 put it , that " @entity6 was built on @entity81 ideals			2
" what 's wrong with this picture ? for one thing , the process itself undermines the hard work , research and professional judgments of teachers and outside experts who toil to come up with a coherent curriculum			0
this year , the @entity7 board approved more than 100 amendments to the 120 - page curriculum standards affecting history , sociology and economic classes			1
instead of acknowledging that genuine disagreements over interpretation and emphasis are the lifeblood of history , they reduce it all to a cartoonish process of correcting perceived " bias			0
" this is a terrible trivialization of history , contributing to the dumbing - down of what students learn			1
if we want to equip our students with analytical skills , the tools that allow them to become critical thinkers and better citizens , then we need to expose them to a greater variety of often conflicting sources : primary documents , biographies , monographs , films and so on			0
we need to acknowledge there 's no such thing as history with a capital h. there are only individual men and women who struggle to make sense of some aspect of the past , bringing our own passions , preconceptions and points of view to our writing			2
@entity6 history looks a great deal more inclusive , capacious , contentious and messy than it did a half century ago			1
that is because contemporary events always affect how we understand the past			0
thus , the civil rights movement led to an explosion of innovative and groundbreaking scholarship on @entity148			0
similarly , there was very little attention to the historical experiences of women before the feminist upsurge of the 1970s			0
the antiwar movement and @entity155 of the 1960s and ' 70s prompted major reconsideration of the history of @entity6 foreign relations			1
the environmentalist movement has inspired a broad rethinking of the nation 's relationship to the land and natural resources			0
much recent historical writing has confronted some of the more painful and difficult aspects of our past , such as the grim realities of @entity6 apartheid and the powerful influence of white supremacist thinking			2
but does this sort of work somehow demean @entity6 , as conservative critics charge ? perhaps , if your goal is to reduce the study and teaching of history to a kind of pseudo-patriotic cheerleading			1
but i believe we have an obligation to present our students with inconvenient facts , to make them uncomfortable and to teach them how to assess competing interpretations of our past			0
future historians may look back at the @entity7 textbook wars as a prime example of how contemporary political movements shape how we engage history			1
i ca n't think of a better example of that than the current campaign waged by conservatives to remove " bias " from textbooks			0
their success threatens to impoverish our students , teachers , and classrooms			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity209 .			2
