-- @entity1 is an impressive country			1
and nobody knows it better than the @entity1			1
the country is surprisingly like the @entity5 ( which it taught a thing or two about liberté ) in that you do n't really ever need to leave			1
there are sophisticated cities , sunny seashores , snowy mountains and wooded valleys all in one country			0
not to mention a lot of cheese			0
as well as quite a few other things the @entity1 do superlatively well			1
cheese yes , it 's a cliché but @entity1 remains the ultimate destination for cheese lovers			1
@entity24 once asked how he was meant to govern a country that produced 246 varieties of cheese			0
maybe he was afraid they were living organisms and would start a revolution			0
some @entity1 cheeses , such as @entity32 , are so smelly and runny they seem to be decomposing			1
even mild , hard @entity33 is apparently so scary that last year the @entity5 restricted its import			1
no one 's arguing against the existence of great cheeses around the world -- but no @entity1 citizen needs to go much further than the corner shop to find one			1
shopping there 's a reason the @entity1 invented the word " bourgeois , " which now stands in for all things materialistic			1
@entity49 department stores stock everything from cheap generic brands to labels so chic you feel the need to dress up before trying them on			0
the annual sales in january and at the end of june offer unbelievable bargains because by law all stores have to discount prices at the same time and compete for business			0
at the other end , the @entity1 have defended their small , often family - owned neighborhood stores -- boulangeries , boucheries , épiceries -- from being steamrollered by chains			1
the @entity1 also do quirky , one - off boutiques probably better than anyone else			1
museums @entity49 , of course , is home to perhaps the world 's best known museum , the @entity73			0
but @entity1 museum culture spreads much wider afield			1
the @entity78 region has what is arguably the most beautiful collection of museums in the world -- its chateaux include the huge @entity84 , with a spectacular collection of tapestries , and the impossibly romantic @entity87 , astride its moat			1
even the lesser - known castles can be wonderful -- @entity91 , for example , is set above a perfectly preserved old town			0
you can almost hear @entity94 riding up to the gate and offering to kick the @entity97 invaders out of @entity1			1
trains @entity1 trains are faster than planes			1
if you want to go from @entity49 to the @entity103 coast for lunch , hop on a @entity105 , or " very fast train			0
" three hours later , you 'll be sipping rosé and gazing at billionaires ' yachts while the fliers are still putting in a claim for their lost luggage			0
tgvs crisscross the country , and the @entity115 ( @entity1 national railways ) offers excellent online deals -- first class for just a little more than second			1
the @entity1 might like the good life but it need n't also mean slow			1
traffic jams the average @entity1 driver 's notion of etiquette is a strong but terrifying one : i 'm going that way , and you ca n't stop me			1
if going where he or she wants to means causing an accident or total gridlock , that 's everyone else 's fault , non ? the unwillingness to acknowledge any other car on the roads -- the supreme @entity1 belief in liberté incarnated in the automobile -- means that on every saturday in summer , and on national holidays , the whole country is transformed into a huge traffic jam as everyone drives to or from their vacation at exactly the same time			1
politeness politeness -- the @entity1 ? are n't they notoriously abrupt , especially @entity150 when addressing @entity152 - speaking tourists ? more accurately , the @entity1 have mastered the art of being impeccably polite and startlingly dismissive at the same time			1
when a posh maître d ' raises one eyebrow and oozes " monsieur ? " or " madame ? " at you , he 's simultaneously respecting you and questioning your right to exist			0
but if you get the hang of @entity1 politeness , anything is possible			2
the golden rule is simple : you should begin every conversation with a bright " bonjour ! " ( " bonsoir ! " in the evening )			0
this does n't just mean hello			0
it 's recognized @entity1 code for , " yes , i am here , and i am respecting you by being polite , so you are going to respect me and maybe even be pleasant to me			1
" all that in one magic word -- and it works			0
sexiness it 's hard to pin down sexiness but , for many , " being @entity1 " is a good working definition			1
that accent , plus a certain insouciance and @entity179 ( yep , inevitably slipping into @entity1 here ) make a pretty attractive package in both men and women			2
and then there 's plain sex , which is everywhere in @entity1			2
take @entity1 films , for example , which almost by law have to include at least two naked breasts and four buttocks			2
frenchmen and women know the rules of attraction equally well and rarely stop playing			0
it 's almost a duty to look sexy and classy whenever anyone else is around -- and to leave a memorable impression			0
luxury it 's a clever trick			0
when you think of luxury goods , the word " @entity1 " slips almost automatically into place			2
today , the @entity1 talent for luxury has trickled down beyond @entity206 , @entity207 , @entity208 and the rest			2
its effects can be felt in the dozens of stylish @entity49 cafés with starched - apron waiters , and in the many reasonably priced spa hotels , such as @entity214 ( @entity1 site only ) , that can make you feel like a millionaire without charging you accordingly			2
@entity1 light - touch sophistication has been copied worldwide			2
customer service ( oh yes ) related to " politeness , " but with an important retail distinction			0
the @entity1 have a saying : the customer is king			2
yes , and we know what you did to your kings			0
but behind a sometime façade of surly indifference , @entity1 service can be wonderful			2
that grumpy waiter does n't hate you , it 's just that he 's a pro and you 're an amateur on his territory			0
the same goes for the snooty department store saleswoman			0
unlike in other countries , such jobs in @entity1 can still be lifelong careers , bringing a lifetime 's worth of skills			2
the thing to do is soldier on , smile and inform your server what you want			0
the @entity1 respect people who know what they want , and will do their best to help you get it ( as long as it 's not just before their lunchtime , of course			2
globalization @entity1 has the world 's best policy on globalization -- it spends so much time complaining that foreign invaders are killing off its economy that no one notices how @entity1 products are taking over the planet			1
have you checked recently who provides your electricity , who owns your transportation system , who feeds your army , even who built your city 's public toilets ? especially if you live in @entity272 , there 's a strong chance you 'll find a @entity1 multinational , such as @entity274 , @entity275 , @entity276 or @entity277			0
that 's not to mention the countless @entity1 brands on every shopping street in the world			1
next time a @entity1 person tells you @entity284 is destroying @entity1 culture , just point to the nearest public toilet			0
@entity288 's ( @ sclarkewriter ) books about @entity1 include " @entity289 " and " talk to the snail : @entity291 for understanding the @entity1			0

the @entity1 are impeccably polite -- really
they 're so good at making certain cheeses that the @entity5 has tried to restrict them
their traffic jams are world class , but so are their ( very fast ) trains
globalization : simultaneously the bane of @entity1 and something it excels at
