the internet in @entity1 is entirely different to the internet used in the developed world			2
in @entity5 or @entity6 , the internet is generally something you surf on a computer or tablet -- a device with a 10 - inch to 15 - inch screen			1
in @entity1 , hundreds of millions of people will experience the internet for the first time on a 2 - inch cellphone screen			1
probably in black and white			0
and probably only as text			0
they may not even know they are using the internet			2
@entity22 , for instance , offers search and @entity24 via @entity25 , the text message service that is still the most popular form of communication			1
text messaging is important because it works on any kind of phone , especially the older so - called feature phones that still dominate			1
while the rest of the developed world is rushing headlong into smartphone heaven -- with powerful touchscreen devices that are more mini computer than voice - calling phone -- @entity1 's workhorses are the kind of phone seen in @entity6 cities circa 1998			1
the reason is simple : with a dearth of infrastructure , the vast majority of people ( an estimated 1.5 - billion globally , according to the @entity45 ) have no electricity			1
more people in @entity1 have a mobile phone than access to electricity			1
that means , for a phone to be functional , it needs decent battery life			2
these feature phones have anywhere up to a week			0
secondly , many have the two other must - have features : an fm radio and a torch			2
radio remains the killer app in @entity1 , especially for mass communication			0

there was a statistic bandied about in the 1990s that @entity71 had more phone lines than the 55 countries in @entity1			2
impossible to verify , but it reveals the scale of the communications problem			0
until mobile phones came along , that is			0
cellphones have made it possible for anyone to have a phone -- to make calls , send smses and , using clever payment systems like @entity87 's @entity86 , send mobile money to another phone user			1
half of @entity87 's gdp now moves through mobile money , and @entity86 reportedly handles $ 20 - million a day in transactions			1
mobile money is projected to become a $ 617 - billion industry by 2016 , according to researchers @entity97 , who predict mobile transactions will reach $ 171 - billion this year			1
already , 80 % of the world 's mobile money transactions are happening in @entity102 , driven by @entity87 , the epicentre of mobile innovation			1
other services are also flourishing : ways for consumers to check whether medicine is authentic and has n't expired ( @entity109 ) ; for farmers to find out where they can get the best price for their produce ( @entity113 ) ; for people to do real - time live mapping of disasters or elections ( @entity118 ) ; and for communities to communicate with each other ( @entity121 and @entity122 )			1

the economist renamed us the " hopeful continent " last year , after it noted that six of the 10 fastest growing economies in the last decade were in @entity1			0
@entity1 has about one billion people , but already has an estimated 700 million sim cards ( by @entity135 )			0
it 's important to note these are sim cards and not users			0
many people , myself included , have at two or three sim cards , and perhaps a 3g data dongle			0
because cellphone operators charge interconnect fees to make a call to another network , many people simply have a sim card for each network and swap them out of their phone when they want to make calls			0
savvy to the various offers -- including ones for cheaper on - network calls in the evenings and weekends -- family members or students use different networks at different times of the day to stay in touch			0
mobile phones , by their nature , are better suited to @entity1 's historical inadequacies and current challenges			1
smartphones , which are growing but not nearly at the same rate as in the developed world , are appearing ; and with them , an app market is slowly developing			0
computers have always been too expensive for the majority of @entity177 , most of whom have never had a home phone line			1
a cellphone is cheaper to buy , cheaper to run and is always on you			0
in @entity182 , for instance , @entity22 says 25 % of its searches during the week are via mobile , rising to 65 % on the weekends			1
simply put , @entity1 is not just a mobile - first continent			2
it is mobile - only			2
join us at @entity190 / @entity189			0

the first time most @entity177 use the internet is on a mobile phone , says @entity195
@entity195 : while many do n't have electricity , mobiles mean anyone can have a phone
mobile money is *big* business - half of @entity87 's gdp now moves via this method
in @entity182 , 25 per cent of @entity22 searches are via mobile
