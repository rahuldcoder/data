@entity0 -- what is the @entity4 debt deal ? @entity4 , the country at the center of the eurozone debt crisis , pushed through a huge debt swap in march to save it from disorderly default and clear the way to receive its second bailout , worth â ‚ ¬ 130 billion ( $ 171.5 billion )			1
the country 's massive pile of debt has threatened the stability of the 17 - country eurozone during a crisis which has dragged on for almost two years			2
the announcement that @entity4 successfully pushed through the largest ever sovereign debt restructuring gives some breathing space as the bloc attempts to pull itself back from the brink			2
in the deal , the country swapped existing bonds for new ones that are worth far less , effectively halving the country 's â ‚ ¬ 206 billion bill to private sector creditors			2
the restructuring takes pressure off the country in the short term , but as it struggles to rein in huge debts , questions remain over its ability to remain in the eurozone			2
at the time of the swap , @entity41 , of @entity42 , said : " it seems unlikely that the @entity4 [ debt deal ] , despite its sizeable writedown , is the last we 've seen of @entity4 in this crisis			1
" he added , " there are still questions overhanging the restructuring and further questions over whether this deal makes @entity4 's debt position sustainable			1
" does @entity4 still face disorderly default ? the decision to insert collective action clauses in @entity4 bonds -- which enabled the country to force through the debt swap against the will of some creditors -- was deemed by ratings agency @entity62 's to be a " selective default			1
" investors who hold credit default swaps on the country 's debt -- a type of insurance against default -- were paid out following the deal			1
however , the greater fear has been that @entity4 will face disorderly default , or a sudden inability to pay its bills			1
that has been avoided for now , but the country is facing a contracting economy and its debt is currently at 160 % of its gdp			0
questions are already being raised about the ability for @entity4 , which is entering its fifth year of recession and struggling under harsh austerity measures , to pull through without further restructuring			1
an election expected in may is likely to further shine the spotlight on @entity4 's commitment to the austerity measures which it was forced to implement in exchange for the bailout packages from its eurozone peers and the @entity93			1
throughout the crisis , which was triggered after @entity4 admitted its finances were far worse than first reported , the country has faced protests on the street and an inability to raise money from investors , leaving it reliant on the bailout funds			1
why is @entity4 still being supported ? the financial collapse of a eurozone member is politically and economically charged			1
the common currency lies at the heart of the " @entity108 dream " and a disorderly default by one its members would be devastating			0
so @entity4 is being supported by its eurozone peers as @entity108 's leaders , led by @entity114 chancellor @entity113 and @entity116 president @entity115 , desperately attempt to figure out how to fix the problems			1
the potential for the crisis to spread to @entity120 and @entity121 -- the so - called " contagion " effect -- is a powerful incentive to contain the problem			0
bailouts of @entity4 , @entity127 and @entity128 have created backlashes in countries such as @entity114 where the prospect of holding up the bloc 's far larger economies is economically and politically unpalatable			1
so what are @entity108 's leaders doing ? most @entity108 leaders have agreed on a fiscal pact which strengthens a financial firewall and is designed to prevent governments running excessive deficits			0
the â ‚ ¬ 500 billion permanent bailout fund -- called the @entity143 -- is being introduced mid year , rather than next year as originally planned			0
but @entity108 's leaders have come up with grand plans before and been knocked back by the markets			0
it remains to be seen if the latest twist in @entity4 's debt crisis can stem the crisis			1
@entity150 , of @entity151 , said in a note on the deal : " is this the final breaking point in the conversation over @entity4 ? unfortunately i fear not as we 've been here so many times before			1
" he added , " the focus is likely to shift onto other parts of the eurozone with @entity128 being the main target			0
" how serious is a default ? it depends if it is disorderly , or controlled			0
the greatest fear has always been a disorderly default , in which @entity4 would reach a repayment deadline without the funds in hand to pay			1
there have been numerous grim predictions should this situation eventuate , including global panic and market sell - offs			0
a default might mean @entity116 and @entity114 banks exposed to the debt will begin to struggle , resulting in a credit lockdown by the wider banking sector			0
if banks are forced to take this hit , it could have global economic consequences similar to those seen in the financial crisis that followed the collapse of @entity188 in 2008			0
investors would also begin looking at which other countries are facing financial difficulties , including @entity120 and @entity121			0
if investors stop supporting these countries , the eurozone 's stronger countries could again be leaned on for financial assistance			0
but that 's where the help from @entity108 , and further afield , could run out of capacity			0
@entity120 's economy , for example , makes up 17 % of the eurozone -- nearly seven times bigger than that of @entity4			1
these countries are regarded as " too big to fail , " because bailouts would be too expensive			0
how did we get here ? @entity4 's economy has struggled since the country joined the euro in 2001			1
in 2004 , it admitted its budget deficit was higher than allowed under rules of entry			0
by 2008 the government had narrowly passed a belt - tightening budget , designed to trim its massive national debt burden , triggering widespread protests			0
in 2009 , @entity4 admitted its deficit would be more than 12 % of gross domestic product -- far higher than previous estimates and more than four times the requirements of entry into the eurozone			1
the country was hit with ratings downgrades , pushing its sovereign bonds into so - called " junk " territory			0
at the same time , resistance to the austerity measures and a contracting economy have made it extremely difficult for @entity4 to clamber its way out of the financial problems			1
is it time for @entity4 to drop out of the euro ? despite the relief offered by a second eurozone bailout , @entity4 is running out of options as pressure grows on its finances			1
unless it can make good on massive debts it faces financial collapse , with heavy consequences not only for the eurozone countries but for the global economy			2
the @entity247 , @entity93 and eurozone countries have poured money into @entity4 to prevent this outcome and may have to continue doing so unless another solution can be found			2
this has led to calls for @entity4 to be allowed to quit or be thrown out of the euro			2
some @entity4 also support this since they believe it would spare them from harsh austerity measures demanded as conditions for assistance			1
many say it is impossible for @entity4 to drop out because the consequences would be so disastrous that eurozone economies will not allow this to happen			2
how would quitting the euro affect the @entity4 ? this would liberate @entity4 from the eurozone 's fixed exchange rate , allowing it to become a more competitive exporter and -- as it unshackles its currency -- an attractively cheap tourist destination			2
but it would come with a heavy price			0
it would still leave @entity4 in debt and reliant on handouts that former eurozone partners would be less willing to supply			2
it would also mean @entity4 would face higher prices for imported goods			2
it is also likely to drive people out of their homeland as they seek to escape lower wages and higher taxes			0
this could set back the country 's economic recovery back by years			0
@entity1 's @entity286 and @entity288 's @entity287 contributed to this report			0

@entity4 is in *negotiations* over its latest bailout deal , but needs to meet harsh new terms
the country is implementing austerity measures but faces protests and deteriorating finances
the default of a eurozone member is politically and economically charged
