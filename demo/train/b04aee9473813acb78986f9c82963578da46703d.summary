-- like a cat playing with a mouse , former @entity2 manager @entity1 teased his potential @entity6 suitors on wednesday by saying he wants to coach an @entity8 club " in the future "			1
the 41 - year - old @entity1 stepped down as @entity2 coach at the end of last season after four years in charge of one of the world 's biggest clubs to take a year - long sabbatical			1
even since , the @entity18 has been linked with a number of @entity8 clubs -- notably @entity20 and @entity21 -- as well as a host of top @entity24 teams such as @entity25 in @entity26 and @entity27 in @entity28			1
" i 've always found @entity8 football very fascinating , just for the environment , the crowd and the supporters , " @entity1 told the @entity30 's website ahead of the @entity30 's 150th anniversary			2
" as a player , i could n't realise my dream to play there but i hope in the future , i have a challenge to be a coach or a manager there and feel the experience of all the coaches and players that have been there			0
" it is unique , to play in that league			0
i want to feel the supporters , the environment , the media and the style of the players and everything			0
" i am still young , just 41 , so i hope in the future i could be able to train there and enjoy that			0
" @entity1 's update on his future plans is likely to make uncomfortable reading for those coaches in charge of @entity66 's top teams , such as @entity20 interim manager @entity67 and @entity25 's 67 - year - old coach @entity68 -- whose contract ends in june			1
city boss @entity71 's contract runs until 2017 , though there has been speculation surrounding the @entity28 's future following the appointment of former @entity2 vice president @entity76 as the @entity8 champions ' chief executive , who took up his new role in september , and the arrival of former @entity2 technical director @entity81 as director of football at the @entity83 in october			2
@entity1 , who spoke to the @entity30 from @entity84 where he is currently living , joined @entity2 as a 13 - year - old and won six @entity87 titles and one @entity88 as a player with the club			1
he won that @entity88 , now known as the @entity88 , at @entity91 as a 19 - year - old when @entity2 beat @entity93 , who @entity71 was then playing for			1
" i played there as a player when i was 19 and it was my first @entity88 as a player , as @entity2 won finally the @entity88 , " added @entity1			1
" it was a huge honor to play there at the old @entity91			0
" when i was manager of @entity2 , for our second @entity88 in three years in 2011 , it was a real pleasure to play in the new @entity91			2
" i 'm a lucky guy , because i had the opportunity to play two finals , both in @entity8 at @entity91 and that 's why my relationship with @entity8 is pretty close			0
" i would like to say congratulations and happy birthday for the 150 years to @entity8 soccer and all of the people around @entity8 football			0
" enjoy it , because you deserve that and you have been very important in the development of our beautiful , beautiful game			0
" as @entity2 coach , @entity1 presided over an unprecedented treble in his first season in charge , winning the @entity88 , @entity87 and the @entity123 , having been promoted from his role as coach of the @entity18 club 's reserve side in may 2008			1
in 2011 he won the @entity88 again and also a third successive @entity129 title , followed by success at the @entity131 for a second time , winning a total of 13 trophies during his tenure .			2
