-- the @entity1 is countering @entity3 criticism of how @entity5 authorities are handling of case of a 3 - year - old adopted boy who died in @entity9			1
" what is very troubling about this case is that the @entity3 are making very wild accusations against the ( adoptive ) parents before they have information , " a senior @entity1 official told @entity0			1
" i think it is irresponsible of the @entity3 to say the parents did x , y or z before we find out what happened			2
in @entity9 , the @entity23 is investigating because of the " suspicious " nature of the boy 's death , investigator @entity22 said			1
@entity3 officials tuesday met with the boy 's unnamed adoptive parents and his surviving brother , also adopted from @entity3 , after the @entity1 coordinated the session through @entity32			1
meanwhile , a @entity3 governor halted the foreign adoption of orphans in his region after the boy 's death			1
" if we know the facts and they are as the @entity3 claimed , they have every right to be upset just as we would be upset if an @entity5 child was adopted in @entity3 and the same thing happened			1
but there should n't be a rush to judgment when these parents might be in terrible pain over what happened to their son , " said the @entity1 official , who requested anonymity to speak candidly about the sensitive issue			2
the case of the 3 - year - old 's death has aggravated @entity1 efforts push through more than 500 adoption cases in which @entity5 families have already begun the process to adopt a @entity3 child before @entity64 in december passed a law banning adoptions of @entity3 children by @entity5			1
that pending law would ban adoptions by @entity5 ostensibly because of documented cases of abuse by adoptive parents			2
but others say the @entity3 move is in retaliation for a @entity5 law that places restrictions on @entity3 human rights abusers			1
" this is a very difficult case for us and the timing could n't be worse , " the @entity1 official said			2
" we are trying to revolve the rest of these cases , but having a case like this makes it more difficult			0
" officials said , including the death in @entity9 , 20 of about 60,000 @entity3 children adopted by @entity5 in the past two decades have died in the @entity5			1
" we share one hundred percent the @entity3 concerns about these cases of death and abuse , " another senior @entity1 official said			1
acknowledging that 20 @entity3 children have died with @entity5 families , the official added , " we do not disagree this is unacceptable			1
" @entity1 officials said they hope to travel to @entity64 to discuss the pending adoption cases			2
adoptions halted in one @entity3 region the governor of @entity3 's @entity104 is not waiting for the national ban to take effect , and announced tuesday that all orphan adoptions to foreigners would be temporarily stopped			1
" another cruel crime against a child was committed in the @entity5 , " @entity109 gov. @entity109 said			2
the boy was born on january 9 , 2010 , and died on january 21 , said @entity113 , the @entity114 's special representative for human rights			2
@entity113 said the child suffered injuries to his head and legs , as well as to his abdomen and internal organs			0
the wounds , he said , " could only be caused by strong blows			0
" authorities in @entity9 have not released such details			2
but they have offered some specifics			0
the child was found unresponsive at his residence and his mother called 911 , @entity132 investigator @entity131 said			0
the boy was transported to the emergency room by the fire department , then pronounced dead by an emergency room doctor , she said			0
the body has been sent to @entity138 for an autopsy , and results could take weeks , she added			0
@entity141 , of @entity32 , said his office is investigating allegations including physical abuse and neglectful supervision , or neglect			0
sgt. @entity147 , a spokesman for the @entity148 , said his office also is investigating			0
no arrests have been made , and officials are waiting for autopsy results , he said			0
governor wants brother sent back to @entity3 the boy 's death is confirmation of @entity3 's decision to ban @entity5 adoptions , the @entity155 governor said			1
" we need to do everything and create all necessary conditions for the orphans to find families here in our @entity155 region and in @entity3 , " he said			0
@entity167 said his office is working to bring the brother back to his native @entity3 , even though the @entity5 parents have not been charged with any crime or publicly named			1
" you need to start taking the necessary procedures today , " @entity109 said			0
the brother " ca n't stay in the @entity5			2
with @entity5 legislation , he would be transferred from one hand to another			0
it 's an additional trauma for the kid			0
he 's not a dog or a cat			0
" @entity32 says its top priority is the surviving child or children at the home , @entity141 said			0
" at any time , if we feel the surviving child or children may be at risk , we can remove immediately , " he said			0
a call seeking comment to a number listed for the boy 's adoptive parents was not immediately returned			1
a voice message told reporters the parents would have no comment			0
in december , @entity3 president @entity196 signed into law the measure that would ban the adoption of @entity3 children by @entity5 families			1
it is scheduled to take effect in january 2014			0
@entity5 adopted close to 1,000 @entity3 children last year , according to @entity1 figures			1
though the number has been dropping in recent years , @entity3 remains the third most popular foreign country -- after @entity209 and @entity210 -- for @entity5 foreign adoptions			1
the @entity3 measure also bars any political activities by nongovernmental organizations receiving funding from the @entity5 , if such activities could affect @entity3 interests , @entity3 's semiofficial @entity212 news agency said			1
and it imposes sanctions on @entity5 officials thought to have violated human rights			2
the move is widely seen as retaliation for a bill that @entity5 president @entity226 signed into law on december 14			0
that law , called the @entity229 , imposes @entity5 travel and financial restrictions on human rights abusers in @entity3			1
the act is named for @entity3 lawyer @entity234 , who uncovered the largest tax fraud in the country 's history in the form of rebates claimed by government officials who stole money from the state			2
@entity234 was apparently beaten to death in 2009 after a year in a @entity64 detention center			0
backers of the @entity3 bill said @entity5 adoptive parents have been abusive , citing what they say are the 20 deaths of adopted @entity3 children since the 1990s			1
the @entity3 public supported the bill , with 56 % of respondents in a poll conducted by the @entity254 saying they backed the ban , @entity212 reported			0
in 2010 , an @entity5 woman sparked outrage after she sent her adopted son back to @entity3 alone on a one - way flight , saying the boy , then 7 , had violent episodes that made her family fear for its safety			1
@entity0 's @entity264 and @entity265 contributed to this report .			0
