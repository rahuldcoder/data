-- the shooting of an unarmed and naked @entity6 university student killed in a late - night confrontation with a campus police officer appears to be unjustified , the lawyer for the young man 's family said thursday			1
part of the brief incident saturday night that led to the death of 18 - year - old @entity12 of @entity13 , @entity6 , was captured on a surveillance camera outside the @entity16 police station			1
the video has not yet been viewed by reporters or the public , but the @entity12 family 's attorney , @entity20 , said , " there is nothing on the surveillance tape that justifies the use of deadly force			1
" @entity28 sheriff @entity27 said tuesday that collar , naked , sweating profusely and acting erratically , showed up at the police station and began banging on the door and window			1
an officer came out , his handgun drawn , and started issuing orders to collar while retreating backward across the back patio of the building , according to @entity27			0
after retreating for more than 100 feet , according to @entity27 , the officer fired when @entity12 drew within five feet of him			2
collar , struck once in the chest , collapsed and died at the scene			0
the incident unfolded over no more than 20 or 30 seconds , @entity20 said			2
while @entity27 said the police investigation into the shooting continues , @entity20 said he questioned why the officer did not wait until backup arrived to engage @entity12 , who had no history of violence or drug use			1
he also questioned why the officer did not use either pepper spray or a baton in an effort to subdue @entity12			0
the officer had access to both pepper spray and a baton , @entity20 said , but he noted that campus police are apparently not certified to use stun guns			1
" had either a stun gun , baton or pepper spray been used in this case , we would n't be here today , " he said			0
both @entity20 and sheriff 's investigators believe someone gave a substance to @entity12 that led to his erratic behavior			1
at tuesday 's news conference , @entity27 said witnesses told police someone had given collar lsd sometime during the night			0
@entity20 said it would be irresponsible to say @entity12 was on drugs until toxicology results are completed , which could take several weeks			2
he also said he doubted witness statements to police that @entity78 attacked occupants of two cars before reaching the police station			2
@entity27 said tuesday that a witness interviewed by police took a picture of @entity78 against the side of one car			0
" one victim had advised that he had grabbed her arm and was trying to bite her on the arm and making weird noises and statements towards this victim , " he said			0
@entity20 said state rep. @entity95 , @entity96 , will ask @entity6 gov. @entity97 and attorney general @entity98 to launch a review of training and equipment standards for university police departments statewide			1
@entity95 did not immediately return a call seeking comment			0
the death has , of course , been hard on @entity12 's family , @entity20 said			1
but he added they have forgiven the officer who fired the fatal shot , and are praying for him			0
the family will wait for the results of investigations before deciding whether to file a lawsuit against the school , @entity20 said			2
" the goal of the parents is to make sure that this does not happen again to any other student under like or similar circumstances , " he said .			0
