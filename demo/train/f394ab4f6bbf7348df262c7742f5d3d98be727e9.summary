-- the deep financial mess at the @entity2 has revealed a deep fault line in @entity4 about whether we even need the postal system			2
this week we heard from the " let ' em shut down , i do all my communicating online " group			2
and there are those who want to " save the art of writing a letter by hand and mailing it			1
" we 're going to get beyond this divide , right here , right now , with a real - life love story that gets to its destination , as most love stories do , through a route that 's never been traveled before			1
the letter our love story begins with a guy in a rush			1
" gim me a ticket for an aer - o - plane			2
@entity25 n't got time to take a fast train			1
i 'm a-goin ' home			2
" why is this guy in such a hurry ? " my baby just - a wrote me a letter			1
his baby did n't send him an e-mail			1
she wrote him a letter			1
put it in an envelope			2
found a stamp buried in her drawer			1
took it to a mailbox			2
@entity46 checked , i 'm sure , to make sure it dropped in all the way			0
" @entity52 , " performed by @entity53 , @entity54 and other artists , is one of the 500 most popular @entity4 songs			1
to get to the bottom of the story , i made a long distance phone call to @entity59 , the man who wrote " @entity52			1
" the back story i asked @entity59 if he could imagine the guy in his song rushing to the airport -- paying full fare to get home to his baby , who seems to have sent him packing -- if she had sent an e-mail or a tweet			1
he says he never thought of it			0
he wrote the song in 1967			1
who was the guy , i asked			0
was it you ? no. " my dad was in show business for 50 years , " @entity59 tells me			1
" he fancied himself as a songwriter			0
he would get into the story			0
he did n't know when to quit			2
by the time he got the story told he had four or five pages			0
he did n't have a song			1
he had a short story			0
" @entity59 's father handed him one of those " short stories " called " @entity84 " and told him to see if he could do something with it			1
there was one phrase in there that stuck in @entity59 's mind that he 'd one day come back to			1
halfway down the third page			0
the phrase was " ticket for an aer - o - plane			0
" and that 's the way aer - o - plane was spelled			0
one day , in his small kitchen , @entity59 swiveled his chair to his pump organ and just banged out the melody and the lyrics in one take			1
" i just put the words together as they came to me			0
all because of that one word , aer - o - plane , that my dad wrote in the middle of that damn story			2
" just a songwriter in the zone			0
the plot gets hot one more question for @entity59			1
" do you have a favorite among all the songs you 've written ? " " my favorite song , " he says , " is always the last one i wrote			1
... i do n't have a favorite kid or dog			2
i have a favorite wife			2
but then again she 's the last one i married			0
i guess i have a couple more questions			0
how many times have you been married , @entity59 ? @entity127 , he tells me			1
his first wife died too young			2
his second marriage did n't work out			2
but this marriage ... " what brought us together was songwriting			2
we wrote two songs together before we actually met in person			1
" they did not , if you 're wondering , send their lyrics back and forth through the mail			0
they had a friend in common , a @entity141 guitarist , who was the intermediary			0
and then , one night , after one of @entity59 's shows , a woman comes up to him and says she has a song she 'd like him to look at			1
" oh no , " he said			0
" and then she told him			0
the woman he 'd been writing songs with			0
" one morning , " says @entity160 , " he called me up and said , ' would you like to do some writing today ? ' " they 'd ride around for hours in @entity59 's blue - green @entity163 minivan just writing songs			1
any car can be romantic when you 're making music together			0
@entity160 comes up with some priceless titles			0
" my baby 's been @entity169 ' with a @entity170			0
" that was one of their first together			0
" " i 'm not really talkin ' , it 's @entity177			0
" @entity59 and @entity160 have been married 14 years now			1
and writing songs together for longer than that			0
delivery now , the final , final question			0
have @entity59 and @entity160 ever gone to a mailbox and sent each other a letter ? " we 've never written each other a letter , " says @entity59 , " because we 've never really been apart that long since we met			1
... two weeks was about as long as i could stand to be away from her			0
" there 's a song there			2
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity194 .			1

the romanticism of handwriting does n't *translate* to e-mails and tweets , @entity194 says
" @entity52 , " a hit song , captures *emotions* of looking for a stamp , taking letter to mailbox , he says
@entity59 , who wrote the song , met his wife through their *shared* love for songwriting
