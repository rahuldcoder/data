@entity0 , @entity1 -- president @entity3 returned from a tour of the oil - stricken @entity5 on friday and vowed to do all he could to help area residents and businesses clean up the mess and recover financially			1
" we want to stop the leak , we want to contain and clean up the oil , and we want to help the people in this region return to their lives and livelihoods as soon as possible , " the president told reporters			1
flanked by more than a dozen @entity5 - area politicians and officials , the president -- the sleeves of his shirt rolled up -- called the oil spill that began april 20 and continues today " an assault on our shores , on our people , on the regional economy and on communities like this one			1
" this is n't just a mess that we have got to mop up			0
people are watching their livelihoods wash up on the beach			0
" @entity3 said he had heard " heartbreaking stories " from @entity0 mayor @entity35 of fishermen who are trying to figure out where their next paycheck will come from			1
" this is something that has to be dealt with immediately , " he said			0
" this is our highest priority , and it deserves a response that is equal to the task			0
that is why this has already been the largest cleanup effort in @entity48 history			1
" more than 20,000 people are working in the region to clean up the spill , including 1,400 @entity54 troops activated in four states , he said			2
so far , more than 3 million feet of boom have been deployed , he said , adding that he will ensure that the lead federal official responding to the spill , @entity58 admiral @entity57 , gets " whatever he needs to deal with this crisis			2
" @entity3 said it would be " welcome news " if @entity66 's " top kill " effort succeeds in stopping the runaway flow from the well a mile below the surface of the water , but he said that that other efforts are under way , too			1
" a team of some of the world 's top scientists , engineers and experts -- led by our energy secretary and @entity82 - winning physicist @entity81 -- has for some time been exploring any and all reasonable contingency plans , " he said			0
@entity3 said he has directed @entity57 and homeland security secretary @entity84 to triple the manpower in places where oil has hit shore or appears within a day of doing so			1
information about resources available to area residents and businesses will be posted at @entity93 , he said			0
in addition , doctors and scientists will be stationed in the affected states to monitor the potential impact of the spill on the health of residents , an expense that @entity66 will pay , he said			0
" @entity66 is the responsible party for this disaster , " he said			0
" but as i said yesterday and as i repeated in the meeting we just left , i ultimately take responsibility for solving this crisis			2
i 'm the president , and the buck stops with me			0
" he added that federal authorities are prepared " to do whatever it takes for as long as it takes to stop this catastrophe , to defend our natural resources , to repair the damage and to keep this region on its feet			2
" in a response to some local officials , who have been calling for a berm to be created to keep the water from getting into fragile marshlands , @entity3 said @entity57 is prepared to authorize moving forward with " a portion of the idea			2
" and he called on @entity48 to help , too , by visiting the region			1
except for three beaches in @entity1 , all of the @entity5 beaches are open , safe and clean , he said			1
but it was to the long - term residents that he targeted his message : " i 'm here to tell you that you are not alone , " he said			0
" you will not be abandoned , and you will not be left behind			0
" though about 25 percent of the @entity135 exclusive economic zone has been shut , most federal waters in the @entity5 are open to commercial and recreational fishing , according to the @entity137 .			1

@entity3 vows to put federal *muscle* behind cleanup , says there are *alternatives* to " top kill "
@entity3 : " i ultimately take responsibility "
