-- on may 9 , a cool breeze blew across the waters of @entity3			0
gliding across the surface , two teams of world - class sailors -- @entity7 and @entity9 artemis racing -- were hard at work preparing for the upcoming @entity11			2
according to reports , the wind was " a little above normal " at 25 to 35 mph , but nothing that professional sailors could n't handle			0
across the waterfront , anticipation was building ahead of the first @entity11 to be held in the @entity19 since 1995			2
after an uneventful morning training session , disaster suddenly struck , when the 72 - ft @entity23 catamaran bore violently away from the @entity7 , and swiftly capsized			0
beneath its vast hull , @entity25 gold medalist @entity24 found himself trapped , and despite desperate efforts to save him , the married father of two could not be rescued from the wreckage			1
@entity24 's early death shocked the world of sailing and brought a glittering career to a premature end			1
" @entity24 " , as he was nicknamed by his friends after the mischievous tv character in " @entity40 " , was a talented sailor , a fierce competitor , and a devoted father			1
his love affair with sailing began early			1
as a young boy , @entity32 's grandparents took him out in a @entity48 on the spectacular natural harbour of @entity50 in @entity51			1
he was instantly smitten , and from that day onwards sailing was always his first passion			2
after a few years of sailing , @entity32 's parents gave him a boat of his own , which he raced alongside future fellow @entity58 sailors @entity59 and the four - time olympic gold medalist @entity60			1
from the very beginning , the youngster 's love of the sport and effortless talent caught the eye of national racing coach @entity67			1
@entity32 " enjoyed learning to sail better all the time , " @entity67 remarked			2
@entity32 began his career in a laser class one - man dinghy , but soon graduated to the heftier @entity72 class -- the perfect boat in which to prepare for his forthcoming @entity25 career			1
in 2000 , @entity32 was under consideration for the @entity25 in @entity76 , but ultimately lost his place to best friend @entity59 whom he had met as a boy			1
at the age of eight , if it was too windy to sail , @entity32 and @entity59 could often be found building @entity81 together on the shore			1
their friendship was immediate , profound and lifelong			0
when @entity76 2000 finally came around , @entity32 traveled to @entity86 as @entity59 's training partner , and proudly helped his old friend to a gold medal			1
four years later , @entity32 trained alongside teammate @entity60 ahead of the @entity25 in @entity90			2
again , the team found success , with @entity93 taking gold in the @entity72 class			2
finally @entity32 earned his own place in the @entity99 team as @entity59 's crewmate at @entity101 in 2008			1
from the moment they began to sail together in preparation for the competition , the two friends thrived			2
their partnership brought them bronze at the @entity108 -- a strong omen ahead of the @entity110			0
in @entity111 , @entity59 and @entity32 performed beautifully , and began the medal race in second place , before fighting hard to regain the lead from @entity9			1
they sailed across the finish line -- and onward into the history books			0
the following year @entity32 was appointed @entity118 ( @entity118 ) , one of @entity99 's highest honors			1
on receiving the gold medal , @entity59 summed up the intimate connection between the pair 's professional success and their personal friendship : " to share it with @entity24 who 's my best mate of years and years , we 've been through so much			1
it 's the moment when you 've crossed the line and you 're on the water , just the two of you			0
you have n't hit the shore and the crowds and the rest of the team			0
there 's about a 10 minute period which is quite special because it 's the two of you that have been on that journey all the way through			0
it 's a really satisfying feeling of two mates who have worked really hard			0
" talking to the @entity145 in 2009 , @entity32 said he had felt similarly moved : " it was fantastic			2
i mean , what do you say ? it was the most incredible feeling			0
you win a gold medal with your best friend and you 're on the podium and the national anthem 's played and you 've just had a really tough regatta			1
it 's not like we won it easy , it was a real war			0
yes , it was emotional , for sure			0
@entity59 looked like he was going to cry so i put my arm round his back and said ' nice work mate			2
' " when it came to competition , @entity32 was known as a perfectionist , with a meticulous eye for detail			2
he had a sophisticated comprehension of the mechanics of sailing and worked tirelessly on his star ahead of all major competitions			0
@entity59 describes @entity32 as " the friendliest , kindest man i have ever met			1
" within the sailing fraternity he was both respected and deeply loved			0
a cavalcade of tweets from sporting luminaries erupted as news of his untimely death spread across the globe			0
@entity99 cyclist sir @entity182 wrote : " shocked to hear of the death of @entity24 , @entity184 sailor			1
@entity186 him a number of times , great guy			0
my thoughts are with his family			0
" gold winning long jumper @entity191 echoed @entity182 's distress : " waking up to hear the tragic news about @entity24			1
so very sad , a true gent			0
my heart goes out to his family			0
" @entity199 , a spokesman for the @entity11 , and long - time friend of @entity32 said : " i remember some of the photo shoots ahead of the @entity25 where the photographer wanted the guys to look mean and moody and portray synthetic aggression and he just could n't do that			1
he was a perpetual grinner			0
he was given an extra large happy gene			0
" this week , ahead of the @entity11 , @entity59 spoke to @entity0 about his mixed feelings on returning to competition			1
" @entity211 will always remind me of losing @entity24 , " @entity59 said			1
" it will always do that and it 's going to be very painful , but professionally the team are going to come out stronger , they 're an incredibly talented bunch , an incredibly united group and we 're going to hold our head up high and look forward to the future			0
" @entity23 crewmate @entity221 added : " knowing @entity24 and what an accomplished person he was , he would want us to accomplish the mission			2
" the @entity11 opened last week in @entity3 , and will conclude on september 21 .			2
