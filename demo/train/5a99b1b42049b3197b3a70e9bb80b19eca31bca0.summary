@entity0 wants you to know it does n't see customers as a mass of faceless moneymaking advertising targets			1
it understands that you , and the other billion individuals who log on to the social network , are flesh - and - blood humans with feelings			0
that 's why the company no longer refers to members as " users " internally			1
instead it calls them " people			2
" the switch in lingo has even trickled down to internal computer programs			0
@entity18 , the company 's director of product design , explained @entity0 's softened approach to humanizing its customers at the @entity23 in @entity24 on wednesday			1
" it 's kind of arrogant to think that the only reason that people exist is to use what you built			0
they actually have lives , like , outside of the experience they have using your product , " she said			0
@entity0 has an empathy team that designs programs to help engineers and designers understand what it means to be an advertiser or small business -- an experience @entity46 says they can not immediately relate to			1
that can help @entity0 employees create better products for those advertisers and be more invested in figuring out why a campaign did or did n't take off with @entity0 users ( sorry , people )			1
on its own , swapping out a few words does n't mean much , but it shows that a giant global company is working to shift its internal culture			0
if engineers , designers and other employees think of the real people on the other side of their products , it might help them create something more personal and human			2
and that , of course , will make it a little easier to serve people ads.			0

@entity0 stops calling members " users " and switches to " people "
it also has an empathy team to help advertisers humanize customers
empathy team helps employees and advertisers see the site from users ' point of view
