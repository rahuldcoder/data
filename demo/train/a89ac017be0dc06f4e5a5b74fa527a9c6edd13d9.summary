-- a doctor in @entity2 is examining three teenage boys rescued 240 miles from land after they were lost in the @entity5 for more than 50 days			1
@entity6 , spokesman for the police department in @entity8 , @entity2 , said the three were admitted to @entity10 and then released to a private doctor identified as dr. @entity12			2
@entity13 , 15 , and his cousins -- @entity15 , 14 , and @entity16 , 15 -- were famished , dehydrated , exhausted and sunburned when a crew member on a fishing boat two miles away spotted their 12 - foot metal boat and alerted his superior			1
the rescue , which came two weeks after hundreds turned out to mourn them , elated their friends and relatives			1
@entity25 , whose 15 - year - old son @entity13 was among the survivors , told @entity0 thursday in a telephone interview from his native @entity29 that , " i was on cloud nine			1
" " i could n't believe my son and his boys were found again			2
unbelievable , " said @entity25 , who noted that a traditional celebration is now in order			1
" he alerted us that he saw something immediately on our bow , directly in front of us , " @entity35 told @entity0 thursday from his 280 - foot tuna boat			2
" as we drew closer , we could tell that it was a small boat of some type			2
" the boat was a strange find so far from land			2
" it 's not something you go in the open ocean with , " he said , noting that the boat was 240 miles northeast of @entity2 when it was spotted late tuesday afternoon			1
inside were three naked teenage boys -- cousins from the @entity29 750 nautical miles away			1
asked whether they needed help , they said yes			2
when he learned how long they had been adrift , @entity35 released his rescue boat , took them aboard his fishing boat , the @entity60			1
" they looked very bad -- bones protruding from underneath the skin , but mentally strong , strong as an ox , " @entity35 said			1
he moved them to his cabin 's king - sized bed , where " they all fit comfortably , " and began administering first aid to their burned skin			1
" they were ecstatic , " he said			0
he also gave them electrolyte - spiked liquids as he had been trained to do in a first - aid class			0
" i just gave them very small doses -- they more or less let the drink stay in their mouth and they swirled it around and let it absorb in their cheeks very slowly			1
" after about half an hour , they were able to swallow , but he urged them to go slowly			0
" they knew i was trying to help , and they did what i said			0
the cooperation was just incredible from the start			0
" after a couple of hours , they were able to eat small pieces of dry white bread , he said			0
four hours later , he was feeding them slices of oranges and apples			0
" and then they were starting to get a little bit carried away -- they were wanting some @entity105 's or some @entity107 fries , but i could n't allow them to have that yet			1
" after six hours on board , the three teenage boys began to mingle with the crew			1
by 4:30 a.m. local time thursday , they were transferred to a @entity2 coast guard vessel , destined for a hospital in @entity8 on that @entity5 island , " hopefully warm and cozy			1
" throughout , the boys were smiling , he said			0
natives of the @entity29 -- three small atolls in the @entity121 , about midway between @entity122 and @entity123 -- the boys said they had set out in the boat in early october to travel from one island to another , @entity35 said			1
" the islands are pretty close and they can be transited quite easily with these small vessels , " but they got disoriented after losing sight of land , " and that was it , " he said			0
the boys said they had left their island with enough coconuts to keep them hydrated for two days , he said			1
but they used a tarpaulin to catch rainwater and for shelter after their clothes disintegrated			0
and two weeks ago , they caught a seabird , which they ate , he said			1
about the same time , authorities had concluded that the teens could not have survived and declared them dead			0
two weeks ago , their families and friends held a memorial service attended by 500 people , in the island chain that has a total population of 1,400 , according to the @entity152			1
but their rescue came just in the nick of time			1
" they did admit to me they had started drinking salt water two days prior to us rescuing them , " @entity35 said			1
drinking excess amounts of saltwater can shut down one 's kidneys , which can be fatal			2
the boys were spotted in an " unusual place " -- west of the @entity167 , between western @entity168 and @entity2 , said @entity169 , the managing director for the @entity171 seafood company , whose boat found the boys			2
it was dumb luck that the fishing boat came upon the boys , said @entity35 , since its usual port of unloading and operations is in @entity168			0
" by chance , we were going to @entity122 to unload " because the boat was scheduled to be pulled from the water and inspected , a quadrennial event , he said			0
@entity35 called the @entity29 and informed @entity16 's grandmother of his unusual catch			1
" i just told her we found her kids , and it was total hysteria , " @entity35 said			0
" it was just amazing			0
" @entity16 's uncle , @entity193 , told @entity0 that @entity16 's grandmother broke the news to him and others			2
" you should have seen the village , you should have seen the people here , " he said			0
" they were happy , very happy			0
everybody was crying ... we gave thanks to @entity205			0
" @entity25 described a similar scene , with singing and hugging among the villagers when the good news arrived			0
but when @entity13 first phoned his father from the boat , " he cried more than he talked , " his father @entity209 recalled			2
" i can tell you that he 's tired and all , from the way he speaks , " @entity215 @entity13 said			2
" but he was so happy			0
" @entity35 said the boys left their mark on him and his crewmates -- not only because of what they endured while lost at sea , but because of their attitudes after rescue			1
" it was just an uplifting experience to meet these young men , " @entity35 said			0
" they did n't give up			0
" @entity25 said locals are " trying to plan a celebration in a @entity228 way			0
" besides the boys , he would like the tuna boat 's captain and crew to join in the celebratory eating , singing and joy			1
" i 'd like to say thanks , and shake hands and celebrate ... together , " @entity25 said			2
" we want to invite them to the feast			0
" -- @entity0 's @entity242 and @entity243 contributed to this story .			1
