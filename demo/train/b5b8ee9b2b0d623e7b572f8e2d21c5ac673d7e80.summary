@entity0 , @entity1 -- the surprise announcement that the third son of @entity6 leader @entity5 had been made a general has dashed hopes in @entity1 that the @entity8 might prove more economically focused than his father , should he succeed him			1
the announcement by @entity6 state media in advance of tuesday 's @entity13 -- the biggest ruling party meeting there in three decades -- that @entity17 was being promoted to four - star general was the first - ever formal mention of his name in official state communications			1
while many pundits had anticipated @entity17 being raised to prominence as the country 's future leader in the high - profile party conference , most had also expected him to be less military - centric			1
" i had been hearing a lot of talk that he would be more focused on economic matters than his father , " said @entity27 , author of " @entity28 " and an expert on @entity6 propaganda			0
he cited statements by recent defectors who had heard that the upcoming leader had been constructing apartments and accelerating productivity			0
" the fact that he is being formally introduced as a general indicates that he will be another ' military first ' ruler like his father			0
" @entity17 rising in leadership circles in what was then the first - ever handover of dynastic power in a communist state , @entity5 took power in 1994 following the death of his father and " eternal president " @entity51			1
@entity5 adopted " songeun , " or " military first " as his key slogan , superceding his father 's " juch , " or " self - reliance			2
" what is life like inside @entity6 ? @entity6 's military has 1.2 million service members and an arsenal that includes nuclear weapons and long - range missiles			2
it 's considered particularly worrisome , not simply due to the regime 's unpredictability and history of aggression -- it launched the devastating @entity72 in 1950 , and has unleashed a number of military and terrorist provocations in the decades since -- but also because any significant armed clash affecting the heavyweight economies of @entity78 , @entity79 and @entity1 would hammer global financial markets			1
@entity2 's special coverage of @entity6 following a suspected stroke in the summer of 2008 , @entity5 has appeared to be in frail health , fuelling heated speculation in @entity1 and elsewhere about when he will name his successor , and who it will be			2
since early 2009 , a range of signs has pointed at @entity17 as that man			1
with the youthful @entity8 being either 27 or 28 years old , experts expect him to require a mentor to guide him along the path to power in a society in which age is greatly respected			0
@entity5 's brother - in - law , @entity98 , widely seen as his right - hand man since 2009 , is expected to act as regent to the young @entity8 as he takes on increasing responsibilities			2
opinion : political change in the wind ? @entity98 's wife , @entity105 , was promoted to general in the same announcement that mentioned @entity17 , a move seen as solidifying the power of herself , @entity98 , and thereby , the young @entity8 in what many now consider to be less a @entity111 state and more a royal dynasty			1
" @entity105 will be his ' caretaker ' to nominate him if @entity5 dies , " said @entity113 , president of @entity114 for @entity6 , a @entity0 - based non-governmental organization			0
he noted that for @entity17 to formally assume power , he would need to be nominated chairman of the @entity118 and general secretary of the @entity120			1
" the principle of the bloodline means that only a direct descendant of @entity51 can be part of the succession , and @entity98 is not a descendant of @entity51			0
" also on tuesday , the @entity127 stated that the party conference , " ... solemnly declared internally and externally that @entity5 was reelected as general secretary of the @entity120 with the unanimous will and wishes of all the party members			2
" although @entity8 has always held that title , he is usually referred to as chairman of the @entity118			0
the re-designation at the start of the party conference could simply be a tactic to remind the public that @entity8 is party head as well as military head , said @entity27			0
vice guide to @entity6 while state media has been unusually active in announcing protocol details about the highest - placed members of @entity6 's elite , no news footage has yet emerged of the conference , fuelling speculation in @entity1 that its key figure , @entity5 , may be suffering particularly frail health at present .			0

the announcement came right before the biggest ruling party meeting in decades
@entity17 's promotion was the first time he was named in official communications
some *analysts* had hoped he would be more economically oriented
