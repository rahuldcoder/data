@entity0 -- who would 've thought ? @entity5 founder @entity4 speaks @entity6			1
when i first read a banner headline saying that the 20 - something billionaire spoke fluently in @entity10 , i was skeptical			2
yes , i know he 's young and smart			0
yes , he 's married to @entity12 , a publicity - shy medical doctor of @entity10 parentage			2
but she 's also @entity16 - born @entity15 and , like many of them , does not necessarily speak @entity10 like a native			1
besides , one does not learn a foreign language simply by marrying a @entity10 speaker			2
but the @entity5 ceo impressed his star - struck @entity10 audience when he spoke in @entity10 during a 30 - minute q&a recently at @entity0 's @entity26			2
" he showed respect for @entity15 by taking the trouble to learn the language and i think the audience appreciated it , " said @entity27 , one of the pioneers of teaching @entity10 as a foreign language and a former @entity10 translator for @entity31			1
@entity4 spoke entirely in @entity6 , albeit with a heavy accent and the occasional error			1
yet some @entity10 - speaking expatriates disparaged his @entity10 proficiency -- deeming it " poor " and " mediocre , " while others dismissed the session at @entity26 as a pr stunt , perhaps to curry favor in @entity15 where @entity5 has remained blocked since 2009			1
learning for 42 years but i was impressed			0
his tones might have been off most of the time but then so were mine when i was just beginning to get a " feel " for the language			2
as a famous billionaire he could have said no to the idea , instead of risking looking like a fool in public			0
" he deserves credit for undertaking sustained study of @entity15 while growing a major internet company , " agreed @entity27			1
" he and his firm do not need more pr , but full access for @entity5 in @entity15 would be great			0
" i 'm impressed not because i 'm star - struck but because i know how hard a language @entity10 is			2
two months into my first @entity10 course some 42 years ago , i was ready to give up , totally intimidated and overwhelmed by its grammar rules ( or lack of them ) , five tones and pictographs			1
after several months of drills and practice , i got into the @entity10 language " zone " and started to enjoy it			1
still , i do not think i could have learned it well if i had only attended courses overseas -- without the immersion that i got by living and studying in @entity15			2
i acquired it because i was surrounded by @entity6 and because i had to			0
@entity78 , a veteran sinologist and a long - time @entity0 resident , explained why @entity15 is so daunting			0
" those who undertake to study the language for any other reason than the sheer joy of it will always be frustrated by the abysmal ratio of effort to effect , he wrote in a paper when he was at the @entity89 for @entity90			0
" those who are attracted to the language precisely because of its daunting complexity and difficulty will never be disappointed			0
" @entity78 ticked off several reasons why @entity10 is so damn hard : -- because the writing system is ridiculous			0
-- because the language does n't have the common sense to use an alphabet			0
-- because the writing system just ai n't very phonetic			0
-- because tonal languages are weird ; -- because @entity102 , and the twain have only recently met			0
cultural shift remarkably , @entity10 is now enjoying a new found popularity			1
just as @entity107 became the popular choice as a second language because of the influence of the @entity110 before the @entity111 and the @entity16 after @entity112 , we 're now witnessing " a major shift in economic and cultural influence , from the @entity16 to @entity15 , " said @entity27 , who spent 30 years in @entity15 , most recently as director of the @entity116 at @entity26			1
he cites @entity15 's major push to promote @entity10 language overseas , combined with a growing recognition that @entity10 ability will give people a huge advantage in dealing with @entity15 and its people			1
" compared with the several @entity16 students studying @entity10 in @entity125 in 1966 - 68 when i was there as a student , there are now about 25,000 @entity16 students in @entity15 each year , most of them studying @entity10 language , and a large and a growing number of @entity16 are studying @entity10 as part of their k - 12 education in the @entity16 " his tip to @entity10 language students ? " first get a good foundation overseas for grammar and pronunciation , followed by an extended stay in @entity15 for study or work where most or all people speak @entity10 all day			1
" you have to use it , lest you lose it			0
" @entity15 is a great country , " @entity4 told his @entity10 audience on why learn @entity10			1
" i think learning the language can help me know the country 's culture ... and i love a challenge			0
" learning @entity6 , some say , is for those who do n't mind making fools of themselves			1
just like the @entity5 billionaire .			0

@entity4 deserves credit for learning @entity6 , says @entity155
*mastering* @entity10 is a *lifelong* process and its grammar , five tones , and pictographs can be overwhelming
@entity10 is now enjoying a new found popularity among language learners
about 25,000 @entity16 students in @entity15 each year , most of them studying @entity10 language
