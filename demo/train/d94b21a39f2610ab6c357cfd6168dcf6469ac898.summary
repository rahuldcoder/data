-- artists @entity1 and @entity3 have spent the last 13 years collecting the spam and scam emails that most of us delete from our junk folders			1
their content -- from pleas for sympathy and money to promises of easy fortune -- give an alternative history of the world over the past decade , according to @entity1 and @entity3 , both from @entity18			2
a video installation , called " @entity20 , " featuring people reading from scam emails , is one of the five winning pieces of the @entity25 unveiled at @entity26 this week			1
it is the world 's only art prize specifically for @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity32 artists and the only one that rewards proposals rather than finished artworks , say the organizers			1
the winners were announced last october , and the artists had five months to work on their pieces			1
the other four winners were @entity43 artist @entity42 , @entity44 from @entity45 , @entity46 from @entity47 and @entity48 from @entity18			1
@entity1 said they chose 45 emails to read out for " a letter can always reach its destination " from some 4,000 received over the years			2
" in our work we are very interested in the way you write history , " said @entity1			2
" the scammers chose places where corruption is possible , such as @entity60 , the @entity29 or @entity61 , and base their stories around real events and conflicts in these countries			1
" sometimes they claim to be close to the protagonists of the events , such as the son of an @entity30 dictator			1
" you can read a kind of history of the world over the last 10 years in a different way through these emails			2
" you can understand a lot about @entity30 conflicts , @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity61 or what was happening in other parts of the world			1
" the video features ordinary people reading emails originating from their own countries			1
the stories sounds convincing until they mention the $ 35 million they have , said @entity1			2
" they are melodramatic stories about people dying , cancer and disease			0
we chose ones that were well written , even if their @entity96 was poor			0
" sometimes the stories are not very far from their lives of the people reading them and some were very touching to film			0
you can be fooled by them for a while			0
" also on inside the @entity29 : can @entity104 be beautiful again ? a more personal piece comes from the @entity43 artist @entity42 , who produced " to my brother , which he describes as a tribute to his brother @entity111 , killed by an @entity113 sniper during the @entity114 in 1987			1
" to my brother " is a series of 60 inkless carvings on paper , tracing photographs from @entity111 's wedding in 1985			0
the pages look blank from a distance and only reveal their detail up close			0
" my work is about disappearance in general and especially in the @entity43 context , " said @entity42			0
" this piece comes in the same line , but it is more personal			0
" it was hard to begin work because when i started looking at the pictures , it was the first time i had looked at them since his death			0
" after three months ' work , i felt i was living with my brother again , being with him day by day			1
" @entity18 artist @entity48 combines his take on his country 's civil war with the ancient tradition of recording military victories on vases			1
@entity18 has a history of political instability			0
in 1975 civil war broke out between @entity147 and the @entity150 - @entity149 alliance			0
it raged for 15 years years , killing more than 100,000 people			0
his work " @entity156 " features seven @entity156 porcelain vases featuring key battles from @entity18 's civil war			1
it is , according to the exhibition booklet , " part - beautiful object , part - historical document , and part - mass - produced product			0
" the two remaining prize winners also give a modern twist to historical events or art forms			1
@entity44 , an @entity45 artist and filmmaker , produces a medieval marionette theater with ceramic dolls			0
the scene shown is taken from a painting by the @entity174 painter @entity173 featuring @entity175 delivering a speech , which is thought to have led to the launch of the @entity178 one year later , in 1096			0
the curtains to the theater open for only a minute at a time , leading to the title , " a glimpse of @entity183			0
" @entity47 artist @entity46 's work " the @entity191 " is seven embroidered quilts featuring maps of port cities along trading routes of the former @entity190 empire			1
" apart from being trade gateways , these cities were also sites of resistance and rebellion against the imperial powers , " says the exhibition booklet			0
also on inside the @entity29 : @entity200 women : pampered or oppressed ? @entity201 , the @entity202 guest curator of the @entity25 , said the works -- displayed under the title " @entity205 " all follow a common theme			1
" the works all refer to history and how we are living in a moment when the models we are used to are coming apart , from the @entity213 , to financial crisis in @entity215 and @entity216 to the @entity217 , " she said			2
" it 's the first time that there 's a unified exhibition at @entity25 , that 's my own little @entity213			1
the exhibition is more than the sum of its parts			0
the exhibits are strong , but also speak to each other to give a richer experience			0
" @entity201 said the $ 120,000 prize money given in advance based on proposals allowed artists to make work that would not otherwise have been possible			1
" it 's extremely important that there 's production money because that 's the most difficult thing for artists to find resources to concentrate on a piece they want to make , " she said			2
" it allows artists to venture outside their comfort zone and do things they would not normally do			2
" " now in @entity26 there 's an art scene that 's maturing so these political and critical artworks can be appreciated in a place like this , " added @entity201 .			2
