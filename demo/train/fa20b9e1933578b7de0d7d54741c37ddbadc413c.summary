-- even the prospect of rain is little help to the crews fighting an @entity6 wildfire that killed 19 of their comrades			1
but firefighters battling the @entity11 blaze did get a boost from the @entity14 military , which committed four specially equipped @entity16 transports to the effort tuesday			1
about 400 ground personnel and 100 incident management staff are working to control the fire , shadowed by the near - total loss of an elite team that was overrun by the spreading blaze sunday			1
" you have to acknowledge it , " @entity24 , a spokeswoman for the firefighting effort , told reporters tuesday morning			1
" you ca n't push it behind in your head , but acknowledge it , and then they get their head back in the game			0
they have to focus very hard on the ground , or we 'll be in that same circumstance again			0
" and though tuesday 's forecast calls for about a 25 % chance of thunderstorms , those squalls could bring gusts of 50 to 80 mph , lightning and only " spotty " rain , @entity40 forecaster @entity39 told reporters			1
" although 80 miles per hour is unlikely , the potential there is for stronger winds than what we saw on sunday afternoon , " @entity39 said			1
meanwhile , temperatures in the 90s are expected to prevail throughout the week , he said			0
the fire had scorched about 8,400 acres tuesday morning and was largely unchanged tuesday afternoon , incident commander @entity56 told a public meeting			2
how to help the families the region has been suffering from an extreme drought , and the winds whipping through the mountains can blow embers into new patches of parched woodland and mesquite grass , @entity24 said			0
" that mesquite is extremely oily , and once that starts , an ember gets into those extremely dry fuels , that fire is going to rip , " she said			2
" it 's very difficult to control at that degree , especially with the winds that we 're having out here			0
" the fire has scorched about 13 square miles of the mountains outside @entity78 , 80 miles northwest of @entity79			1
it remained completely uncontained tuesday morning , @entity24 said			0
late monday afternoon , the @entity81 advised residents in the communities of @entity84 and @entity85 to evacuate their dwellings			0
an estimated 200 homes and other structures have burned in @entity85			0
though firefighters got a break with higher humidity and brief showers tuesday morning , " the winds are just drying out that fuel right after the rain is hitting the ground , " @entity24 said			2
" it 's a pattern that is very difficult to work with			0
" remembering those who were killed the @entity16 crews now joining the fight will have their work cut out for them in battling what is now considered the deadliest fire in state history			1
equipped with the @entity108 , or @entity108 , the planes , loaded with water or fire retardant , can drop 3,000 gallons in less than five seconds			1
the retardant covers an area one - quarter of a mile long and 60 feet wide , and the aircraft can land , reload and be airborne again in under 20 minutes			1
" they 'll be capable of actually dropping a lot of liquid on that ground in areas where it will be most effective , " @entity24 said			0
the planes are from @entity119 , where crews had been working on fires for the last several days			2
but they are now considered more vital for @entity6			1
the military deployment is coming at the request of civilian firefighting authorities			2
a @entity127 official confirmed the details to @entity0 but declined to be identified because an announcement has not yet been made			0
@entity0 's @entity130 contributed to this report .			0

80 - mph wind gusts are " unlikely " but possible , forecaster says
