-- in 2010 , the @entity1 suspended or revoked the certification of 139 physicians for giving away or soliciting examination questions for a board review company			1
@entity0 subsequently reported on residents preparing for certification examinations using questions reproduced by people who took previous exams			1
residents taking the @entity13 medical physics examination wrote down test questions ( " recalls " ) , and shared them with future examinees			1
dermatology residents also reproduced questions ( " airplane notes " ) minutes after the certification examination			1
question reproduction violates copyright policies			0
however , some physicians @entity0 interviewed said that recall use is like preparing with a study guide since questions are used to confirm underlying knowledge , not rote memorization of answers			2
consistent with this view , only 43 % of medical students surveyed at a @entity32 medical school thought it was clearly wrong to convey information about test content to another student examinee			1
however , such behavior should create concern for the quality and integrity of patient care			2
medical students who cheat on examinations are more likely to falsify information in a patient 's medical record			1
patients want physicians to be certified based on a valid assessment of the knowledge necessary to provide high - quality care			0
if patients can not trust the knowledge that board certification is expected to measure , the medical profession loses the public 's confidence			1
moreover , certification should indicate the ability to care for patients , rather than efficient test preparation			0
notably , although patients express a highly favorable view of certification , it is not required by most hospitals and health care plans			0
the distinction between cheating and guided study is crucial			2
old test questions and recent examination experience are routinely used to create study materials			1
the @entity75 produces a summary of concepts and information most likely to appear on the @entity1 certification exam			0
the content of this summary is shaped by post-examination residents			0
the first aid series for medical students is updated annually based on examinee reports			1
using a focused study guide created based on examinees ' input bears some similarity to studying from practice questions that may have been on a recent examination			1
the difference lies in the detail and specificity of the information conveyed			0
nevertheless , from the public 's perspective , both practices represent " shortcuts " for examination success			1
drivers of dishonest behavior cheating in education and sports creates unfairness between " competitors			1
" unlike performance - enhancing drugs , the use of @entity109 and @entity110 to improve test performance is not considered cheating			2
difficulty concentrating and anxiety are perhaps considered abnormal disadvantages from which examinees deserve sparing			0
the unfairness perspective is reflected in a dean 's observation in the @entity0 report -- since use of reproduced questions is so pervasive , this norm does not cause any unfair advantage			1
unfortunately , 57 % of surveyed medical students claimed that others ' cheating had unfairly disadvantaged them			1
the difficult content of the radiology physics exam is one reason for the use of reproduced questions			2
for most physicians , the exhaustive study of biochemistry and pharmacology is a rite of passage based on knowledge rarely used			0
in fact , the physicians interviewed by @entity0 said that the necessity to demonstrate proficiency of arcane material unimportant for practice was a root cause of residents using reproduced questions for exam preparation			2
in other words : test content that medical students view as unnecessary for clinical care makes them more likely to cheat			1
of course , a desire to succeed underlies the decision to cheat : 40 % of 665 medical students across six schools admitted to doing something unethical to avoid a poor evaluation			1
however , fear of failure is not generally sufficient -- social context is important			0
academic dishonesty is strongly connected to peer behavior			2
many medical students believe certain forms of cheating can be justified if the motivation is to assist friends			1
of 2,459 medical students from 31 schools , 41 % had cheated during high school and 59 % thought that cheating was too common to eliminate			1
when misconduct becomes an established norm , as it apparently has among certifying residents , it does not become acceptable , but can be difficult to stop			0
how to limit unethical behavior the use of reproduced questions for board examination preparation threatens medicine 's integrity and public trust			1
moreover , indisputably dishonest behaviors are far too common among trainees			2
punishments and honor codes do little to reduce academic dishonesty in medical education			2
responses to unethical acts have also been hampered by divergent opinions about the severity of specific violations and appropriate punishments			0
however , peer behavior has a strong impact on ethical decisions			2
the image of dermatology residents writing down test questions together in a restaurant suggests this has become an established norm			2
trainees find it more acceptable to engage in unethical conduct when their friends are as well			0
the best way to limit unethical behavior is to embed academic honesty into institutional cultures , perhaps through role models and curricula that emphasize the respect that a virtuous professional may earn			0
case - based ethics training may improve moral reasoning , although the impact on conduct is unknown			0
examination content must be highly relevant for the patient - care activities that will be endorsed			0
esoteric questions suggestive of academic hazing should be eliminated			0
not reusing test questions would reduce the incentive to reproduce questions in verbatim form , but might jeopardize the consistency of passing standards , while increasing expenses			0
in the end , successful certification must demonstrate that physicians are vested with the trust of both their peers and the public			0
sponsoring rigorous examinations that cover material critical for patient care will bolster what the profession provides patients			0
ultimately , the integrity of the medical profession and the faith that patients place in physicians demand the highest moral standards			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity250 .			1

doctors were disciplined for sharing examination questions
@entity250 says cheating is *surprisingly* common among medical students
he says cheating *fosters* behavior that can persist through doctor 's career
