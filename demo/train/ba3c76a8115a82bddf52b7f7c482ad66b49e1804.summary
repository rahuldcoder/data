ever since @entity1 had the business acumen to make free @entity3 as defining to its brand as " grande frappucinos , " workers have delighted in leaving their offices in favor of brighter , more caffeinated workspaces			2
as the traditional office undergoes a global demise , hotels are starting to change their function to accommodate the new wave of mobile workers			1
" we 're really trying to transform the way people think about hotels , " says @entity16 , @entity17 's vice president of global operations services			1
" we want people to think of @entity17 as a place not just to come and sleep , but to work			2
" earlier this year , @entity17 started testing a new concept called @entity25 on demand			1
in 35 hotels throughout the @entity28 ( and one in @entity30 ) , guests and non-guests alike can book small - scale meeting space for $ 50 an hour			1
" customers said that they were basically sneaking into the lobby to steal @entity3 , or else were sitting in our parking lot and plugging in from their car			0
we say , ' we give you permission			0
come in and sit in our lobby			0
' " the last three months were an operational experiment , says @entity16 , one that was obviously successful			0
in the next two months , they will expand @entity25 on demand to six more locations in the @entity28 , with an eye on their properties abroad			1

they have n't asked for more than that			0
" last month , @entity56 launched @entity57 , which is similarly aimed at a younger , more transient workforce			1
their rooms , which are priced at $ 50 to $ 60 an hour , accommodate a smaller audience ( four max ) , and are a bit more tricked out			0
the focal point is media : scape , a worktable that lets multiple users drag and share documents from their person devices			0
there is a whiteboard area for brainstorming and even an @entity72			0
there is also a lounge area to help facilitate job interviews , a function that guests were previously performing in the hotel lobby			0
" you 'd see a group of consultants hovering over a laptop , trying to prepare for a presentation , or else people had interviews , and the lobby was n't providing enough privacy for the topic they were discussing , " says @entity79 , senior vice president and global brand leader at @entity56 and @entity81			2

they plan to open 40 more in the @entity28 by 2014 , and one in @entity107 is under construction			0
according to @entity56 's research , 75 % of workers in the @entity28 are on the move , meaning that for at least one day a week , they have no steady office			1
worldwide , that number is 30 % , though growing quickly			2
the @entity116 ( @entity116 ) puts the number of mobile workers worldwide at 1.3 billion			1
" from a corporate perspective , signing a five - to ten - year lease for an office building is a completely broken model , " notes @entity119 , the founder and ceo of @entity121 , a kind of matchmaking platform that links displaced workers with rent - by - the - hour offices			2
the surge of transient workers , he contends , is not merely a function of increased technology ( though that has made it possible ) , it is also something being driven by companies			1
" real estate is the second largest expense for most companies , and if you look inside the corporate campus , that desk you 're assumed to be at all day , you 're only at a third of the time			2
" in response , a growing number of companies have done away with assigned work spaces all together			1
global consulting firm @entity149 made business headlines last year when they abandoned permanent offices			0

they are also partnered with big firms , such as @entity149 , who use the @entity121 platform to allow employees to search for available desks internally			0

however , @entity119 reckons it 's only a matter of time before other brands catch up			0
" hotels implicitly are in the business of space ; they are extraordinarily efficient at providing space on demand			2
the next logical step is to broaden the brand as a place to work , not just a place to sleep			0

by some estimates , mobile workers number 1.3 billion globally
@entity17 is about to expand @entity25 on demand , a project aimed at accommodating the growing number of transient workers
