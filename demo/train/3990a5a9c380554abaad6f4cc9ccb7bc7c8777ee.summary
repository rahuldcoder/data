@entity1 the @entity0 will announce long awaited rules sunday governing how @entity4 , often called drones , will be legally allowed to fly in the @entity6 for business purposes			1
currently , all commercial remote controlled aircraft are banned , unless a specific , rare exception is obtained from the @entity0 and operators follow a lengthy list of rules			1
only a handful of those exemptions have been granted since the first was awarded to energy giant @entity15 and @entity4 manufacturer @entity16 in june for aerial surveys in @entity18			1
" these surveys on @entity18 's @entity23 are another important step toward broader commercial use of unmanned aircraft , " transportation secretary @entity19 said in a news release at the time			2
" the technology is quickly changing , and the opportunities are growing			0
" @entity19 and @entity0 administrator @entity29 will announce the new rules during a conference call for reporters			0
one of the most significant challenges facing regulators is how to keep the small drones away from larger aircraft with people on board			1
there have been several close calls where pilots of commercial planes came within feet of @entity4			1
" we saw a drone , a drone aircraft , " an @entity44 pilot radioed in march as he came in for a landing at @entity46 in @entity47			2
the @entity4 came within 200 feet of the jetliner as it was flying at 1,750 feet , three miles from the runway , according to the @entity53			1
it 's unclear how complicated the new requirements for commercial drone use will be			0
the @entity0 would not provide details saturday evening			0
an apparently prematurely - posted @entity0 document led some drone advocates to believe they will be less burdensome than what is now required of the few operators who received exemptions			0
on january 5 , @entity65 became the first realtor to obtain an @entity0 exception to fly a drone to shoot video of houses for sale , but he was required to follow 33 detailed restrictions laid out in a 26 page letter			0
to legally fly his uav , @entity65 must have a regular pilots license , pass an aviation medical check , be assisted by a spotter , request permission two days in advance , and limit flights to less than 35 mph and below 300 feet .			2
