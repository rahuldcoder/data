editor 's note : a nationally syndicated columnist , @entity2 is the author of " listening to the @entity4 " and " speak , @entity5 ! a @entity7 's view of @entity8			1
" visit his web site for more information			0
he is hosting " @entity14 " at 8 p.m. et on @entity11 while @entity12 is on maternity leave			0
@entity2 says @entity15 , @entity16 , is being slammed for being honest about her beliefs			1
( @entity11 ) -- a lot of folks are always saying they like to keep it real , that they want authenticity and straight talk			0
yet when someone actually does it , there is hell to pay			0
welcome to the world of @entity15 , @entity16 , who , since she answered a question regarding same - sex marriage in sunday 's @entity31 pageant , has been savagely attacked by those who oppose what she had to say			1
leading the burn - her - at - the - stake parade is media opportunist @entity37 , the self - described gossip queen , and the individual who kick - started this controversy by asking the initial question as to whether the issue of same - sex marriage should be left up to the states			1
it seems that @entity37 , who is gay , was none too pleased that @entity16 chose to actually give her personal opinion on the issue , and ripped her on his blog after the show , using crude obscenities as he continued to attack her at every turn on his media blitz			1
hey , @entity37 , from a real journalist to a wan na - be who traffics in gossip : never ask a question if you 're unprepared for the answer ! frankly , this whole story is pretty stupid			1
is n't the whole point of asking a question to get someone 's true feelings , rather than the plastic and superficial answers we are all used to receiving ? sure , @entity16 could have gone the safe route and given one of those answers that reveal nothing and is hard to decipher -- you know , the ones politicians give all the time -- but no ! she actually gave her real opinion , and is now being torn to shreds for it			0
she opposes same - sex marriage			2
so what if she had said , " hey , i 'm in full support of same - sex marriage			2
" would she now be celebrated on gay - focused blogs , magazines and web sites ? would her detractors actually be saying how open she is and that she 's a great person ? same - sex marriage is undoubtedly a hot button issue			1
and being from @entity15 , the site of @entity88 , the ballot initiative that voters approved outlawing same - sex marriage , @entity16 has surely had to hear the debate go back and forth			1
but her remark is n't outside the mainstream			0
a @entity94 poll shows that 55 percent of @entity8 are against same - sex marriage , and @entity88 did pass in her state 52 - 48 percent			2
ireport.com : @entity16 ' should step down ' what 's interesting about this is that many of the same folks who are slamming her for her remark voted for president @entity101 and vice president @entity102 , who both have the same belief : that marriage should be between a man and a woman			1
even secretary of state @entity108 made it clear that she has the same view , and it was her husband , president @entity112 , who signed the @entity113 , the federal law that forbids states from having to recognize gay marriage in other states			1
in other words , four of the biggest liberals in the country have the same belief as @entity16 , but a beauty pageant winner is being torn to shreds			0
hello , hypocrisy ! those who criticize @entity16 have the same right as she does to express their viewpoints			0
but enough with all the political correctness , where someone says she should have danced around the issue , smiled and move on			0
ireport.com : ' thank you , @entity15 ! ' at the end of the day , we all have to be true to ourselves			2
whether it 's a gay gossip writer who favors same - sex marriage or a heterosexual woman who is against same - sex marriage			2
the day we condemn folks for speaking honestly is the day we become a bland society			0
maybe we 're already there			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			2

@entity2 : *people* say they want others to express themselves authentically
he says miss @entity15 is being criticized for expressing her beliefs
@entity2 says @entity37 is carrying on a crusade against her
@entity2 : her beliefs on gay marriage *mirror* those of @entity101 and @entity102
