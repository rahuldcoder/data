-- in february 2009 , president @entity1 gave this stern warning to bailed - out banks : " you are not going to be able to give out these big bonuses until you 've paid taxpayers back , " @entity1 said at a town hall meeting			1
" you ca n't get corporate jets , you ca n't go take a trip to @entity10 or go down to the @entity11 on the taxpayers ' dime			0
" he should have added : " ... unless you work for the federal government			0
" twenty months later , as we all now know , a government agency called the @entity18 rolled into @entity10 on $ 822,000 worth of taxpayers ' dimes so that 300 federal employees could enjoy a luxury spa , a clown show and a mind - reader , among other " over the top " entertainments at a regional training conference			1
the revelation , unearthed by an internal inspector general , has resulted in two senior - level firings and the resignation of @entity18 chief @entity32 , while triggering the usual amount of political japery in @entity35			1
but it 's worth lingering on the contrast between this incident and @entity1 's original bank target			2
the bailed - out bank that had been planning to send its most valuable employees to @entity10 -- as it had been doing for years -- was @entity42			1
one fact largely overlooked in the national shaming campaign that proved effective enough to derail the trip was that @entity42 did n't want the bailout			0
or at least said it did n't when then - treasury secretary @entity47 summoned the nation 's top nine private bankers to @entity35 on october 13 , 2008			1
here 's how @entity52 described the scene : " [ @entity54 ] he nine bank bosses , assembled in the @entity57 's imposing boardroom , were each handed a piece of paper with the terms : $ 25 billion of preferred shares each from @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity42 and @entity66			0
in return for the capital , the @entity67 would collect a 5 % dividend in the first five years			2
although @entity42 chairman @entity71 resisted , @entity47 gave the bankers no choice			0
" @entity75 's @entity74 put it even more explicitly , and presciently : " @entity71 had a point			0
why should his company , @entity42 , sign its freedom ( and his compensation ) away to the @entity57 when , unlike many other banks , it had n't overloaded itself with risky , mortgage - backed securities ? the @entity42 chairman eventually agreed monday to treasury secretary @entity47 's capital injection plan -- it was , frankly , an offer he could n't refuse -- but @entity86 's objections still resonate			2
amid the continuing market turmoil , there is a sense that all of us are being asked to assume collective guilt for the large , but still identifiable , group of rogues and villains who got us into this mess			0
and then we 're supposed to just forget about it			0
" a funny thing about collective shame -- we are happy to administer it on @entity101 who get their arms twisted by the feds , yet we shy away from applying it to one of the only truly collective entities we have : taxpayer - funded government			1
we love to bash @entity108 for trading exotic mortgage - backed derivatives , but we are far less likely to even point out that the government - sponsored enterprises @entity111 and @entity112 were trailblazers on the derivatives - trading fronts			2
it should n't be surprising in this climate that federal employees would assume they get to play under different ethical rules and public scrutiny than fat - cat bankers			1
after all , senate majority whip @entity121 , @entity122 , said last month that discretionary spending has been cut " to the limit , " and @entity1 just this week thundered that the @entity126 @entity125 's recently proposed budget -- which , by the way , increases spending from $ 3.5 trillion to $ 4.9 trillion over the next decade -- amounts to " social darwinism " that deliberately guts the middle class			1
and let 's not forget what the @entity18 does : as the @entity135 puts it , the agency is " essentially the government 's personal shopper for big - ticket items , like buying and leasing buildings and cars			1
" these are precisely the people tasked with making sure taxpayer dollars are spent most wisely			0
we have a federal government on autopilot , borrowing 40 cents on every dollar , after a decade - plus bipartisan spending binge that has doubled the budget in nominal terms			2
@entity35 is a boomtown , gentrifying rapidly as the rest of the country eagerly awaits the appearance of green shoots			2
the surprise is n't that a federal agency went wild , or even that it got caught			0
what remains a genuine stumper is that the rest of the country has n't quite figured out that the real @entity160 has relocated 2,500 miles east			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity163 .			0

@entity163 says @entity1 told bailed - out banks in 2009 to curb corporate ***junket*** spending
he says $ 822,000 @entity18 ***junket*** shows our lecturing government guilty of same thing
he says we like to shame bankers even as @entity35 wastes , *overspends*
@entity163 : vegas ***junket*** not as surprising as @entity67 not seeing real @entity160 is @entity35
