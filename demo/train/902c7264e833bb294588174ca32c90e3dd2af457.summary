-- after hours of debate and forceful arguments from @entity4 prime minister @entity3 , the @entity4 cabinet this week approved a deal to exchange more than 1,000 @entity8 prisoners , many linked to some of the deadliest terror attacks on @entity4 civilians in recent years , for the release of an @entity4 solider captured by militants more than five years ago			1
sgt. @entity15 has been held captive by @entity16 without any contact with the outside world since the summer of 2006 , and efforts to end his captivity have become a rallying cry for thousands of @entity4 who have actively supported efforts by his family to put pressure on the government to bring about his release			1
while the deal to free @entity15 was backed by a commanding @entity30 majority of 26 - 3 and enjoys wide support from the @entity4 public , there is growing debate about the price @entity4 is willing to pay in order to free a single soldier			1
families of victims of terror , as well as some members of the @entity4 government , have expressed fierce opposition to the deal			2
one minister who voted against the agreement called it " a great victory for terrorism , " and there are fears that the release of convicted murderers will lead to further attacks on @entity4 civilians -- a fear that , critics say , is borne out by statistics			2
according to @entity4 association of terror victims @entity60 , 180 @entity4 have lost their lives to terrorists freed in previous deals since 2000			1
difficult decisions about prisoner releases are not new to the @entity4 government			2
@entity4 has a long history of freeing large numbers of prisoners in exchange for its soldiers and citizens			2
the most notable of all was the @entity72 of 1985			0
the @entity4 government headed by then - prime minister @entity74 ( the current president ) agreed to release 1,150 prisoners in exchange for three @entity4 soldiers captured in @entity77 by the @entity78 led by @entity79			1
the deal aroused immense controversy due to the stark asymmetry			0
@entity83 , the only minister who voted against the agreement , said then , " i thought this was a terrible example , for us to show all our enemies that for them the best deal is to kidnap soldiers and citizens			0
we must have the strength to tell the families of the captive soldiers -- there is a line that the nation can not cross			0
" and pushing this latest deal is prime minister @entity3 , who has built a reputation as a strong opponent to deals with terrorists			1
three years after the @entity72 , @entity3 explained his philosophy about negotiating with terrorists to @entity0 's @entity105			2
" on one case i did not swallow it			0
when my government did something that i simply could not live with , which was the release of jailed terrorists for three of our pows			0
we wanted to get our pows back , and the government , in my judgment , made a big mistake and traded terrorists			0
and here i was confronted with a situation that everything i believe in , in fact agitated for and tried to use an example of @entity4 for , to encourage other countries , especially the @entity123 , to adopt a tough no - concessions policy against terrorists			1
" in his 1995 book " @entity127 " @entity3 called the @entity72 " a fatal blow to @entity4 's efforts to form an international front against terrorism " and warned of the hazardous consequences of such moves			1
" the release of a thousand terrorists ... will inevitably lead to a terrible escalation of violence , because these terrorists will be accepted as heroes , " @entity3 wrote			2
in making those arguments , it is likely @entity3 was aware of the aftermath of the @entity72			0
@entity143 says that " out of 238 terrorists freed in the @entity72 who reached the @entity145 , 48 percent returned to terrorism and were recaptured by @entity4 forces			0
" in order to better understand the special status of @entity15 in the @entity4 public eye , one needs to go back 25 years to the crash of an @entity4 warplane in @entity77			1
on board the plane was @entity4 air force navigator @entity155 , who was captured alive by local @entity158 group @entity157 and later handed over to @entity159			0
despite reports of several attempts to negotiate his return , @entity4 failed to free @entity155 , and as the years passed traces of his whereabouts had been lost			1
in june of 2008 @entity159 announced that @entity155 was no longer alive			0
@entity155 has become a symbol of the failure of @entity4 governments over the years to strike a deal that would bring him back alive to his family			0
@entity15 supporters have expressed fears that if a deal was not reached soon , the young soldier 's fate could be similar to that of @entity155			2
speaking to his cabinet this week , @entity3 said that with so much change sweeping the region , he did not know whether a better deal for @entity15 was possible , and warned that if the window of opportunity was not taken it could close indefinitely			1
it represented a vast change in outlook and rhetoric for the combative prime minister , who seems to have calculated that a softer approach was the more politically expedient road to follow			0
whether it was the prospect of going down in history as the @entity4 leader who missed the chance to free @entity15 , the calculation of larger geopolitical changes in the region , or a mere reflection of public sentiment , @entity3 has chosen a path that has taken him away from much of what he has spent decades preaching .			1

@entity15 has been held captive by @entity16 since the summer of 2006
efforts to end his captivity have become a rallying cry for thousands of @entity4
there is growing debate about the price @entity4 is willing to pay to free one soldier
