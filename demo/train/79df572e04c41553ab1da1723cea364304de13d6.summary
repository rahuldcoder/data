-- @entity1 was confirmed as winner of the race to @entity4 sunday despite not lifting a club in anger for six weeks			1
victory for @entity9 @entity8 in the @entity10 -- at the expense of @entity1 's nearest challengers @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 -- left the @entity16 with an unassailable lead ahead of the @entity18 in @entity4 later this week			1
it is the second time in three years that @entity1 has ended the season as @entity22 number one , having claimed two major titles and a lucrative @entity25 event			0
but eyebrows were raised when the 25 - year - old @entity1 said he would sit out the @entity28 and @entity29 tournaments in @entity30 to prepare for a court battle against his former management company			0
with such a big lead after his earlier triumphs , the world number one judged he afford to miss out on more big pay days , his last appearance on the @entity38 coming with a second place at the @entity40 in the first week of october			0
@entity41 's @entity13 , who won the @entity29 event , made a brave attempt to win in @entity44 to keep the race alive			2
he started the final round sunday just a shot off the lead , but could only card a closing 71 to finish tied eighth , with @entity14 19th and @entity15 25th			0
@entity8 , who lives in @entity51 , clinched his first @entity38 victory with a superb closing 65 on the @entity54 royal course at @entity55 to finish 17 under par. it left him a shot clear of @entity60 's @entity59 , who was left to rue a missed six - foot birdie putt on the 18th to force a playoff			1
@entity63 of @entity64 finished third to move into second in the race to @entity4 standings , but 2,726,514 points behind @entity1 , with 1,666,600 on offer to the winner in @entity4 next sunday			1
@entity1 will go in search of a search of a second win in three years at @entity74 , delighted to have wrapped up the @entity75 , awarded to the player who finishes the season as @entity79 's top player			2
" this has obviously been the best season of my career by a long way , and to win the race to @entity4 for the second time really is something truly special , " he told the official @entity38 website			0
" that four - week spell over the summer , from the @entity89 to the @entity90 , would have to be the best golf of my life , so i feel like i 've really earned the race to @entity4			0
" the top 60 players in the race to @entity4 after this week 's tournament , with @entity8 up to sixth , will play in the $ 8 million end of season finale .			1
