@entity1 said any question on moving the tournament would have to come from the @entity136 organizers and as it stands the @entity135 is still scheduled for june or july in 2022			1
@entity27 told @entity150 : " any request for change must come from @entity136			1
but they have not made this request yet , because they know that if they do so , the other bidders could say ' ah , there is a change			0
' " on the question of whether the vote could be repeated he added : " i do n't know , i do n't know			0
this is a hypothetical scenario			0
in this moment , the organizers from @entity136 have confirmed to us that they can organize the @entity135 in summer			2
