-- the new head of @entity2 describes @entity4 's president as " the leader of criminal gangs , the protector of traitors , " and applauds anti-government protesters seeking to topple him , in a video that appeared on extremist websites this week			1
but one prominent @entity4 activist , @entity12 , rejected the praise of the terror network 's leader , @entity14 , telling @entity0 " we will not permit him or his organization to toy with our revolution and our movement			1
" " @entity4 is not a playground for jihad , " said @entity12 , who said he would n't be surprised if the regime exploited the message to escalate its crackdown against anti-government protesters			1
@entity14 's message is believed to be his first since he was named leader of the terror network , following the death of former leader @entity32 in a @entity34 raid in @entity35 in may			1
@entity0 could not independently verify its authenticity			0
in the video , the bespectacled 60 - year - old , dressed in a white robe , gestures and points with his finger as he speaks			2
he uses the seven - minute video , which first appeared wednesday , to discuss @entity4 and address the protesters seeking to oust president @entity46			1
the protests have sparked a bloody government crackdown in various cities , according to witnesses			0
" oh free people of @entity4 and its mujahedeen , " the @entity2 leader said			1
" it is better for you not to ally yourself with the colonialist powers of the world and the new crusades			0
" @entity14 said the @entity34 changed its stance on @entity4 after similar uprisings led to the ousting of the longtime leaders of @entity63 and @entity64			1
" @entity34 , which had committed itself to @entity46 for the length of his rule , announces today that it stands with you , " @entity14 said			1
" after what it saw and the ground shook from the thunder of your rage and after it was devastated by the loss of its two biggest agents in @entity64 and @entity63			0
" the terror leader accuses the @entity34 of planning to replace @entity78 with someone who protects @entity81 interests			0
" today @entity82 seeks to put in the place of @entity46 who loyally protected the @entity85 borders , another regime against your revolution and jihad with a government that follows @entity34 and cares for the interest of @entity81			2
" @entity14 , the longtime deputy to @entity32 , took over leadership of @entity2 in june			1
in the video , he does not make a reference to his new leadership role or the death of @entity32			0
the video was produced by @entity97 , @entity2 's media arm , and the graphic at the beginning of the piece states it was shot in the @entity104 calendar @entity105 which is between june 3 and july 1			2
@entity0 can not independently verify the accuracy of this date			0
the new leader was indicted for his alleged role in the 1998 bombings of the @entity34 embassies in @entity112 and @entity113 that killed 224 civilians and wounded more than 5,000 others			0
the @entity116 has a $ 25 million reward for information leading to his capture , the same amount it had for @entity32			0
@entity12 , a prominent rights leader and member of the opposition inside @entity4 , was a political prisoner from 1984 to 1991			2
he said @entity14 and other militants " want a foot in @entity4 because it is a strategic country that can serve many of their interests			1
" " @entity2 is already in @entity129 , but in @entity4 , @entity2 has no stronghold so it would like to gain one , " he said			2
" @entity132 is trying to enter the picture and pretends he has credibility with ranks of demonstrators on the streets of @entity4			0
this will be a failed attempt because the youth of @entity4 's revolution have no interest in the jihadists of @entity2			1
" protesters have been demonstrating across @entity4 after friday @entity104 prayers , but @entity12 said @entity146 is kidding himself if he thinks @entity2 's " jihadist @entity104 " is backed by people just because they march after leaving mosques			1
" in @entity4 there is a forgiving islam that does not accept killing or violence			0
none of the chants in the streets refer to a religious goal , all our aspirations are nationalistic , " @entity12 said			0
@entity12 does think that the @entity4 government may use the statement " as an excuse to ramp up its crackdown on the protesters			2
" " i would not be surprised if in a few days @entity4 state tv begins to claim that jihadist members of @entity2 are responsible for killing civilians to send even more security to raid our homes and villages			2
" @entity0 's @entity171 contributed to this report .			0
