-- the @entity1 has provided a festival of football and color in @entity5 , and its intoxicating nature has had an effect far away from the shores of the @entity9			2
the action and fervor sparked by one of the biggest sporting events in the world has prompted @entity16 's two - time major champion @entity15 to turn his mind to another -- the @entity19			2
and as he stepped up his preparations ahead of the @entity21 in @entity22 , he decided to announce he 'll be representing @entity23 at the @entity24 of 2016			1
@entity15 had previously stated his intention to compete under the @entity27 and @entity16 banner when golf returns to the @entity29 after 112 years			1
but confirming his change of heart at a press conference ahead of the @entity21 this week , he said @entity5 's hosting of the @entity1 had provoked his declaration			2
" i 've been thinking about it a lot , " he told reporters at the @entity35			0
" i feel like it 's the right decision for me			0
there 's no point in delaying it and letting it linger any longer			0
" i do n't know whether it 's been because the @entity1 has been in @entity5 and i 've been thinking a couple of years down the line			1
" i have also thought about all the times that i played as an amateur for @entity16 and as a boy and everything so for me it 's the right decision to play for @entity23 , so i 'm going to play for @entity23 in 2016			1
" if you look at the ( @entity23 ) rugby players , you look at cricketers or hockey players ... they view @entity23 as one , the same as we do in golf			2
" so i do n't think there 's any point to change that or any point to go against that just because it 's a different event or it 's the @entity19			0
" i was always very proud to put on the @entity23 uniform and play as an amateur and as a boy , and i would be very proud to do it again			0
" @entity15 , from @entity66 in @entity67 , played amateur golf on an all - island basis before he turned professional and is eligible to represent @entity27 and @entity16 as well as the @entity70			1
the @entity72 and @entity73 winner received funding from the @entity75 before turning professional in 2007			0
and he has represented @entity23 twice in golf 's @entity1 event , both times playing alongside compatriot @entity79 -- the 2010 @entity72 champion			1
when asked if an olympic gold medal would rank as highly as a major championship he replied : " winning an @entity19 medal is still is not as big as a major championship but it 's up there			0
" the majors in our sport are the biggest and best prizes in the game			0
but as hopefully golf grows in the @entity19 and becomes say bigger in four or five games down the line then it might become bigger			0
" aside from the @entity24 , @entity15 's more immediate concern was getting his clubs back after they were lost in transit by @entity98 during his flight to @entity16			1
the world @entity100 tweeted on tuesday : " hey @ united landed in @entity102 yesterday morning from @entity103 and still no golf clubs ... sort of need them this week ... can someone help ! ? " his plea sparked the airline into action and it promised @entity15 's clubs would be delivered to the tournament venue on wednesday			1
they were as good as their word and @entity15 posted a photo on @entity117 saying : " re- @ united with my clubs ! " @entity15 is in good form after his recent victory at the @entity122 's flagship event -- the @entity123 at @entity124 -- and a top 25 finish at the @entity72 last weekend			1
he has been paired with three - time major champion @entity126 , from @entity16 , for his first two rounds in @entity22 .			0

@entity15 announces intention to compete for @entity23 at @entity24 of 2016
the @entity131 had previously said he would represent @entity132 in @entity5
@entity15 : " i was thinking about all the times i have played for @entity23 as a boy "
golf star 's clubs returned to him after they went *missing* in transit
