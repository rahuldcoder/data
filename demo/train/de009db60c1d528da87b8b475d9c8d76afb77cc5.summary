@entity0 countered with an offer demanding the release of @entity34 , a @entity0 military pilot captured in @entity9 , in exchange for the suicide bomber			1
the militants have not said if that 's a consideration			0
@entity5 said it would kill him if @entity0 did n't release @entity41 , a convicted terrorist			1

that 's the same amount of money @entity69 recently pledged for those " contending " with @entity5			2
