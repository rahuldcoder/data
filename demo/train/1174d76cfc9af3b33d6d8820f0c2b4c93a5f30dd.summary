-- location , location , location : it matters greatly to the success of democracy			0
last week , for the second time in a decade , a popular uprising in @entity8 chased away a corrupt , authoritarian leader			1
( the same leader both times , as it happens			0
) the @entity13 of 2005 ended badly -- and the same adverse conditions overshadow @entity8 's hopes today			1
yet in @entity8 , neighbors @entity17 and @entity18 have supported and defended that nation 's dissidents and democrats			1
but @entity8 is not the only authoritarian regime facing protests			1
and it 's not the only nation where democratic neighbors could make a positive difference			1
unfortunately , in the other case -- @entity30 -- too many of those neighbors are silent			1
except only for brief punctuations by rebellions and invasions , @entity31 ruled @entity8 as a province from the late 17th century until 1991			2
@entity36 seems to regard the state of affairs since 1991 as merely another of those punctuations			0
under @entity36 , @entity31 has subverted @entity8 institutions and manipulated the @entity8 economy			2
the goal has been to subordinate @entity8 as a dependent , compliant and nondemocratic subject state			2
@entity36 succeeded in that goal after 2005			0
he 'll surely try again after 2014			0
whether he succeeds again or is thwarted will depend greatly on the efforts of @entity17 and @entity18 above all			0
those neighbors exemplify the transition to democracy and a normally functioning economy			2
the @entity17 foreign minister was in @entity51 during the crucial hours before the flight of president @entity53			0
@entity18 has offered aid to cover @entity8 's energy debt to @entity31 and has warned @entity31 against any tampering with @entity8 's territorial integrity			1
in @entity30 , at least eight people are dead and dozens wounded in protests			2
many of the casualties have been inflicted by semicriminal motorcycle gangs known as colectivos , loyal to the @entity66 regime , so - called because @entity67 helped change the official name of the country to @entity70 of @entity30			1
the @entity71 has been turned off in cities sympathetic to the opposition , both to stop information arriving -- and , maybe even more , to prevent photos and videos of regime brutality from exiting			0
@entity80 's cable news network has been dropped from @entity30 cable systems			1
@entity0 has been threatened with the same fate unless it alters its coverage more to the authorities ' liking			0
@entity0 has not complied , and thus far the @entity30 government has not executed its threat			2
@entity88 has sent troops to reinforce the government			0
in this dangerous situation , the presidents of @entity91 and @entity80 have urged the @entity30 government to permit peaceful protest and eschew violence			1
these statements carry impressive moral weight			0
@entity91 is @entity98 's outstanding democratic paragon			1
since the end of the dictatorship in 1989 , power has alternated from democratic right to democratic left and back again			0
outstanding economic management has led @entity91 to the highest per - capita income in @entity98 , catching up to @entity106 and @entity107 , and ahead of @entity17			2
@entity80 has made impressive progress subduing a decades - long insurgency and inviting former rebels to join the political progress under the new and more liberal constitution of 1990			2
it has suppressed drug trafficking : aerial surveys indicate @entity80 's coca acreage has been reduced by three - fourths since 2000			1
president @entity118 has hailed @entity80 president @entity119 as " bold and brave " in his work for peace and security inside @entity80 -- a task made more complex and difficult by the @entity125 's military and financial support for the drug - trafficking remnants of the @entity80 insurgency			1
because the presidents of @entity91 and @entity80 are identified with the political right , however , their condemnation is easier for the @entity30 government to shrug off than would be condemnations from democratic presidents associated with @entity136 's democratic left			1
@entity138 's @entity137 could play an especially important part here			1
herself once a left - wing guerrilla against @entity138 's former military regime , @entity137 embraced democratic politics in the 1970s and 1980s and was chief of staff to president @entity144 , a former trade unionist and @entity138 's first president of working - class origins			1
@entity144 was everything that @entity67 pretended to be , a leader who promoted social welfare policies while also respecting basic freedoms and civil rights			0
unlike @entity67 , who started his political career with a failed coup , @entity144 always followed constitutional rules			0
again , unlike @entity67 who repeatedly rewrote @entity30 's laws to extend his hold on power , he left by the constitutional timetable			1
as @entity144 's successor , @entity137 inherits much of his prestige			0
yet that moral voice keeps silent as @entity30 's goon government exerts ever more censorship , corruption and violence to extend its grip on power			1
the authoritarian governments of @entity136 -- not only @entity30 but also @entity88 , @entity169 , and @entity170 -- form almost a trade union of shared ugly interests			2
where is the unity of the continent 's democracies ? for very understandable historical reasons , @entity136 governments worry about overbearing @entity136 action			0
yet many wo n't act , even when their most important interests and most cherished values come under violent attack			0
the leaders of @entity18 and @entity17 have learned from history that embattled democrats , when left alone , may die alone			0
the lessons apply as well in the @entity188 as in the @entity189 -- the lessons and the responsibility			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity194 .			2

@entity8 and @entity30 experience deadly uprisings against authoritarian regimes
@entity194 : @entity8 's neighbors support the activists , but many of @entity30 's do n't
@entity91 and @entity80 condemn regime , he says , but they *'re* right wing and thus *suspect*
@entity207 : @entity138 could play a big role in supporting democratic change in @entity30
