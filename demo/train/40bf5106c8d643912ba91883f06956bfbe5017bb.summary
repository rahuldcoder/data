@entity0 , @entity1 -- baby showers herald the transition to motherhood			1
roses , greeting cards and invitations to lunch , celebrate mothers every may -- well at least in most parts of the world			2
in @entity14 by and large the story is n't so rosy			2
every 90 seconds , somewhere in the world , a woman dies from a pregnancy - related complication ; for them and their families there will be no @entity21 ever			1
on this glorious day , i want to put a spin on what we are all celebrating and ask each woman to take a moment to think about the thousands of women across @entity1 and millions across @entity14 who may never celebrate @entity21			1
the process of becoming a mother -- pregnancy - can be difficult and sometimes life threatening			1
we do n't like to talk about these difficulties and dangers			0
after all @entity14 is a continent of strong women			2
myths and tales are told about how we give birth in the bush and minutes later we are on our feet going to fetch firewood or water			0
i think what 's even more startling is the fact that when these women pass away , no one remembers them or eulogizes them			0
you will be hard pressed to find an obituary item that says " she lost her life , giving life			0
" for these women and their families , there is no @entity21			0
that 's why this year , i ask you to heed my call and that of @entity60 and stand up for @entity62 mothers , wherever they may be			1
according to the @entity64 's trends in @entity65 : every 90 seconds a woman dies from a pregnancy related complication , that 's 1,000 women a day 90 % of these deaths are preventable 99 % of maternal deaths that took place in 2008 ( most recent data from 2010 study ) occurred in @entity14 ( 57 % ) and @entity76 ( 30 % ) 50 % of all maternal deaths take place during the first 48 hours after delivery			1
the causes for these astounding figures are not limited to the inability of women to access a health facility due to transportation costs ; only 10 % of women deliver at a health facility where a skilled birth attendant is present			0

the typical and entrenched mentality is that " since my mom and mom 's mom delivered at home , why ca n't i ? " but the harsh truth is that poorly equipped with merely a kanga ( garment ) and razor blade , even the most experienced midwife in the village will find it impossible to handle deadly labor complications such as hemorrhage and high blood pressure			0
another reason behind the high maternal mortality in @entity14 is women 's inferior social status			1
@entity62 women 's perceived inferiority to men leads to school dropouts and forced early marriages			2
a woman without proper education would not be self - protective in terms of reproductive health and a girl barely into her teens forced into early marriage risks her unprepared body in intercourse , both of which may raise the maternal death odds			1
to reduce maternal mortality and strengthen the poorly functioning health system a holistic strategy is necessary to be implemented			1
without political will and good stewardship to revamp the health care system women will continue to die needlessly			0
it 's up to you and i to stand up for @entity62 mothers			2
no woman should die while giving life			0
every year 1.5 million @entity62 children are left without a mother			2
for them , there will be no mother 's day			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity155 .			0
