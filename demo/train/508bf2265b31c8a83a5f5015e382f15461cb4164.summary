@entity0 -- @entity2 says all 27 activists from two aid ships stopped on their way to @entity6 have been deported or are awaiting flights out , but flotilla organizers say most refuse to sign papers required to expel them			1
@entity2 sailors boarded the @entity6 - bound vessels friday as they neared the @entity13 territory , which has been under an @entity2 blockade since 2007			2
the @entity17 - registered @entity16 and the @entity18 were taken to the @entity2 port of @entity20 after refusing to heed calls to turn back , the @entity2 military said			1
organizers of the flotilla said six people , including the captains of both vessels and two journalists , had been released by sunday evening			0
the remainder refused to sign waivers allowing their deportation , the @entity17 group said in a statement on its website			2
" they are refusing to sign not because they are legally challenging deportation or are demanding to see a judge , but rather because the waiver says that they came to @entity2 voluntarily and that they entered the country illegally , " the group said			1
of course this is a lie and they wo n't agree to it			0
" the group criticized what it called a " violent and dangerous " seizure of the vessel			2
@entity49 , its coordinator , said the @entity2 pointed guns at the passengers and turned high - pressure hoses on the @entity17 and @entity18 boats , blasting out windows and causing a collision that left the @entity16 badly damaged			1
" the method used in the takeover was dangerous to human life , " organizers quoted @entity49 as reporting			2
" the @entity2 forces initially wanted to leave the boats at sea , but the abductees demanded that they not be left to float at sea , for they would have been lost and possibly sunk			2
" the @entity65 said its sailors " took every precaution necessary to ensure the safety of the activists on board the vessels as well as themselves			0
" an @entity2 foreign ministry spokesman said one @entity18 aboard the flotilla complained of rough treatment by the @entity2 military , but no details were provided			1
activists criticized the @entity2 action as " illegal " and vowed that activists " will keep coming , wave after wave " to try to deliver aid to @entity13 in @entity6			1
according to the activist organizers , this mission was the eleventh attempt to run @entity2 's blockade of @entity6 by sea			1
five missions arrived safely in @entity6 between august and december 2008 , with the rest intercepted by @entity2			0
the activists said the boats were carrying medical supplies and letters of support for people in @entity6			0
asked by the @entity2 navy for their destination , @entity18 activist @entity98 replied , " the conscience of humanity , " the activists said in a statement			1
when sailors repeated the question , asking for their final destination , @entity98 said , " the betterment of mankind			0
" passengers on the boats were from @entity112 , @entity17 , the @entity113 , @entity114 , and the @entity13 territories , the activists say			0
the flotillas have sparked international controversy			1
in 2010 , an @entity2 raid on one flotilla ship , the @entity119 , resulted in nine @entity121 activists being killed , a development that led to the deterioration of relations between @entity2 and @entity121 , once close allies			1
@entity2 was roundly criticized by many over the deaths			0
a @entity129 report criticized @entity2 for its use of excessive force in the incident but described the blockade -- which activists call illegal -- as a " legitimate security measure			1
" @entity2 says it is concerned about the smuggling of arms to @entity6 militants intent on attacking the jewish state			0
@entity6 is controlled by the anti-israel @entity141 militant group , regarded as a terrorist group by the @entity113 and @entity2			0
but activists say @entity2 embargoes of goods into @entity6 from land and sea are collective punishment of civilians in what is a tiny and densely populated strip of land along the @entity154 coast			2
@entity2 has said any organization or state that wants to give humanitarian aid to @entity6 can do so in coordination with @entity2 authorities via existing land crossings into the @entity13 territory			0
@entity1 's @entity162 , @entity163 and @entity164 contributed to this report .			0
