@entity0 @entity2 , @entity3 's best - selling newspaper , may finally be ditching its topless @entity5 models after all these years			1
last friday 's print edition of @entity2 was the last to feature a bare - breasted woman , ending one of @entity3 journalism 's most controversial traditions after 45 years , according to @entity13 , the tabloid 's sister paper			1
the @entity2 refused to confirm the report on tuesday			0
" it 's all speculation by people who do n't work on the newspaper , " a spokesman told @entity1			0
" we regularly mix it up , there 's no hard and fast rule			0
" despite @entity2 's denial , the women featured on the third page of this week 's editions have indeed covered up -- model @entity27 posing in lingerie on monday , and bikini - clad soap opera stars frolicking on the beach on tuesday			2
an overhaul of the most infamous page in the country would be seen as the end of an era and a victory for critics who have derided @entity5 as a sexist anachronism in a society that has moved on since 1970 , when @entity41 launched the feature shortly after purchasing the paper			1
@entity44 , a 20 - year - old @entity45 supermodel , was the first to strip off for the paper in november 1970			0
page 3 quickly became an institution and " page 3 girl " entered the @entity3 vernacular			2
the topless pics were credited by some for giving a boost to @entity2 's circulation figures , as well as launching the careers of a number of glamor models over the years , including @entity58 , @entity59 and @entity60			1
but @entity41 had come under increasing pressure since 2012 , when the @entity63 campaign -- whose slogan is " boobs are n't news " -- demanded that @entity2 's editors kill the page			1
the group 's online petition has attracted more than 217,000 signatures since its launch			0
@entity41 , the media tycoon who also owns @entity73 , seemed to indicate that change could be on the way when he branded @entity5 " old fashioned " in a tweet last september			1
a spokeswoman for @entity63 expressed delight about the rumors but said @entity2 needed to go even further			0
" we 're really pleased , it 's a definite step in the right direction , " @entity80 told @entity1			0
" it kind of depends a bit as well what they replace it with -- if it continues to be women in bikinis then it 's still women being objectified , and we do n't really think there 's any place for that in a national newspaper , so the campaign will continue			0
" @entity95 also had her own idea for what @entity5 could feature in the future : " i 'd love to see a celebration of women -- the @entity2 's in a really unique position here where they could turn things around after 45 years of giving us sexist images			1
they could celebrate women in sport , or some other way in which women contribute to society			0
" no more page 3 was launched by @entity111 in the summer of 2012 after the writer and actress noticed that the " largest female image in @entity2 newspaper was of a young woman showing her breasts for men , even though @entity119 had won her tremendous @entity120 in the @entity121			2
" although topless shots may no longer grace the paper 's print edition , the group 's campaign is far from over			2
the tradition lives on at @entity2 's @entity63 website , and the @entity129 , another @entity3 tabloid , was still featuring naked models on page 3 as of tuesday .			1

the @entity13 reports that @entity2 is *dropping* topless page 3 models after 45 years
@entity41 , the paper 's owner , called the controversial tradition " old fashioned " in september
critics call reports of @entity5 's demise " a step in the right direction "
