-- how would you like to be @entity2 on the day the first person is stabbed or slashed on a commercial airline flight ? usually , it would be unfair to personalize the question like that ; second - guessing a public policy decision after the fact is always easy			1
but in the case of the dimwitted decision to lift the prohibition against passengers carrying knives onto airplanes , @entity10 , the secretary of the @entity11 , will be the one to get the direct blame if something terrible happens in the air , because she has been given ample notice that people who make their living flying think the idea is inexplicable and highly dangerous			1
in early march , the @entity26 -- a part of the @entity11 bureaucracy -- announced that it would soon allow knives with blades shorter than 2.36 inches in length , and no wider than a half - inch , to be carried onto flights			1
there was immediate outcry from members of @entity36 , pilots and flight attendants			0
many people may have assumed that , because the decision was so nonsensical , it would soon be scrapped			2
but it has n't been ; april 25 has been set as the day when , for the first time since restrictions were instituted after the september 11 , 2001 , terror attacks , passengers carrying knives will be permitted to board any commercial flight			1
@entity10 and the @entity26 have shown no inclination to reconsider			1
it was passengers carrying blades , of course , who carried out the 9/11 attacks			1
but @entity10 has been adamant , even flippant , in dismissing the concerns about the wisdom of welcoming blades back onboard			1
the @entity58 reported that , at a breakfast sponsored by that publication , @entity10 rebuffed the critics by comparing them to a comedic character once played by a popular actress in the early years of " @entity64 " : " it 's kind of like @entity66 , you know , if it is not one thing , it 's another			1
" @entity10 's chief official at @entity26 , @entity72 , has said that by freeing @entity26 screeners from looking for small knives , they will be able to " better focus their efforts on finding higher threat items such as explosives			1
" he also said : " a small pocket knife is simply not going to result in the catastrophic failure of an aircraft			0
" @entity83 : @entity85 's sheer love of life @entity88 rep. @entity87 of @entity89 -- he , like @entity90 , is a former @entity91 agent -- recalled those blades ( not explosives ) that resulted in the 9/11 carnage , and characterized the refusal of @entity11 and @entity26 to rethink their position as " borderline idiocy			1
" @entity87 is wrong only about the " borderline " part			0
will every passenger with a knife present a danger ? of course not , and that is n't the issue			2
an infinitesimal percentage of passengers board a flight with deadly intentions			0
the enormously expensive and technologically sophisticated post- 9/11 security measures are in place precisely because their presence is meant to deter those few passengers bent on destruction			2
why would you possibly go to the trouble of electronically frisking everyone boarding a flight , and then wave the passengers carrying knives right onboard ? last week , members of the @entity122 handed out leaflets at large airports around the country , asking for the public 's help in trying to convince @entity11 and the @entity26 to change their minds			2
the association said : " the people on the front lines of aviation security know that allowing knives on planes is a bad idea			2
" and the @entity138 ' @entity137 released a letter from the family of @entity141 , an @entity142 flight attendant killed on 9/11			2
the family addressed the letter to @entity26 administrator @entity90 : " we are astounded by the lack of understanding and thoughtlessness that this terrible decision reflects			0
... the terrorists have to be laughing at how @entity152 ve our government continues to be			0
... for the safety of flight crews , passengers and those potentially affected on the ground , please reconsider this terrible decision			0
take a page from the doctors ' oath and ' first do no harm			0
' " the plan to allow the knives wo n't even speed up the airport screening process			1
try to imagine the scene at the front of the lines , as already overworked @entity26 agents are forced to take tape measures or rulers and gauge the length and width of knives , as travelers insist their blades are shorter than 2.36 inches or that they are n't more than a half - inch wide			1
try to envision the arguments that will ensue			0
so stubborn is @entity11 and the @entity26 about refusing to reconsider the new policy that officials -- why they would choose to say these things out loud is incomprehensible -- are rationalizing their knives - on - planes initiative by publicly declaring that other items onboard could also be used to harm passengers and crew : " if you are talking about a small knife , there are already things on a plane that somebody can convert into a small , sharp object , " @entity10 said			1
summer is coming , and with it flights that are jammed to capacity , passengers who are irritable and hot , delays that make blood pressure rise			0
it wo n't even have to be a terrorist -- just a drunken , enraged or emotionally disturbed passenger who has been given permission by the government to bring a knife along with him			1
@entity10 , at that @entity58 breakfast , was quoted as saying that it was the handling of the announcement of the new rules that was the problem : " where we could have done better , quite frankly , was a little more legislative and public outreach before we announced the decision			1
try to give it a softer landing , as it were			0
" she could n't be more wrong			0
it was n't the handling of the announcement that was the problem			0
it was n't a lack of " public outreach			0
" the problem was -- and is -- the policy itself			0
a policy that will -- unless @entity36 or the @entity228 steps in -- put knives back into the hands of air travelers before this month is out			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity83 .			2

@entity83 : @entity10 will be *responsible* if decision to allow knives on planes brings *disaster*
@entity83 : rule would allow blades under 2.36 inches . but knives were used in 9/11 attacks
he says airline workers and some *lawmakers* are *opposed* ; @entity10 so far wo n't budge
@entity83 : what if an angry or drunk passenger loses control ? the new rule is insanity
