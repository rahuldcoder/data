-- this month marks the anniversary of many historical milestones in the continuing effort to guarantee equal rights to all @entity5			1
the 19th amendment was ratified on august 18 , 1920 , granting women the right to vote			1
on august 28 , 1963 , the rev. @entity9 marched for civil rights and delivered his clarion call for a more just @entity5 on the steps of the @entity13 in @entity14			2
and , 45 years ago friday , president @entity15 signed into law the historic @entity17			1
that law has proved to be one of the most successful civil rights laws in our nation 's history , extending to millions of @entity5 the right to vote and the opportunity to participate more fully in our democracy			1
in celebrating its 45th anniversary , we must also remember that passing the @entity17 and other civil rights laws was no easy feat. after the @entity34 , ratification of the 15th amendment was supposed to extend voting rights regardless of " race , color or previous condition of servitude , " meaning former @entity41 slaves would have the right to vote			1
but that promise was left unrealized because state legislatures ( especially the southern states of the @entity46 ) expertly circumvented the @entity47 and used " @entity49 " laws to ensure the continued disenfranchisement of african - americans			2
poll taxes , " literacy tests " and blatant threats of violence depressed voter registration rates in black communities			0
blacks attempting to register to vote were often brutally beaten			0
on march 7 , 1965 , about 600 peaceful civil rights workers were marching from @entity62 to @entity63 , @entity64			1
while attempting to cross the @entity66 in @entity62 , these nonviolent activists were savagely beaten and bloodied by @entity64 state troopers			0
the images of that brutality were displayed on tv and in newspapers throughout the country and around the globe			0
those visuals are widely credited with shifting public opinion in favor of the nonviolent protesters and leading to the passage of the @entity17			1
@entity15 ( a @entity79 ) and other national leaders showed amazing strength and courage by forging ahead with legislation that many in the @entity46 would have called an overreach of federal power			0
the civil rights movement awakened the nation 's conscience			0
passage of the act signaled a new era of voting rights in the @entity5 , finally enfranchising low - income blacks			1
it introduced federal oversight of elections to eliminate intimidation of minority voters and arbitrary registration requirements			0
the law directed the @entity103 to challenge states ' use of poll taxes , and one year later , the @entity101 responded by declaring such taxes unconstitutional violations of the 14th amendment			1
amendments to the @entity17 in the 1970s introduced protections for language - minority citizens , and later amendments banned supposedly " neutral " voting regulations that had racially disparate effects			1
the protections contained within the act , a century in the making , finally gave force and effect to many of the hard - fought gains of the @entity34			1
the @entity17 is directly responsible for the election of dozens of @entity125 members and the formation of the @entity127			1
today , @entity129 voter registration rates are approaching those of whites in many areas , as are the rates of @entity135 voters			0
i wonder how the 1960s civil rights marchers would be treated by today 's new media : whether the powerful images they created through nonviolence could be edited to instead show a riotous crowd ; whether nightly opinionated " journalists " could successfully portray them as mere lawbreakers			1
and , i wonder whether today 's political leaders would have the same courage as those serving in 1965			2
recall that it was n't in @entity15 's political interest to forge ahead on civil rights policies , but it was the right thing to do for the country			0
it seems doubtful that today 's elected leaders would take such a stand , especially in light of the growing chorus of @entity157 lawmakers questioning the citizenship provision in the 14th amendment			2
states today are also fashioning new ways to restrain voting rights			1
@entity164 , for example , relies on outdated and inaccurate information to verify the citizenship status of @entity167 registering to vote			0
the @entity103 concluded that the program improperly harms minority voters			0
rather than repair its program , @entity164 elected to sue the federal government in hopes of continuing to use its flawed process			0
a heavily disputed law now on the books in @entity178 forces voters to show government - issued photo id , which is inconvenient and expensive to obtain , keeping many low - income people from casting a vote			2
other states have enacted similar laws or have simply refused to comply with federal demands , perhaps betting that they are unlikely to face reprimand from an overburdened federal government			0
this year , an election administrator in @entity79 -- a state employee -- publicly mocked the @entity17 's language minority protections , telling an audience that poll workers should simply speak in slow , broken @entity192 to @entity194 - speaking voters			2
we know that the promise of equality enshrined in our @entity47 , and brought to bear by the @entity17 , falls victim even today to ideological skirmishes and petty politics			1
but honoring the anniversary of the @entity17 means acknowledging these remaining challenges and committing ourselves to addressing them			2
just as it was 45 years ago that when @entity49 was the law of the land			0
the right of every citizen to vote is too fundamental to the health of our democracy to be wielded as a political cudgel or traded away in favor of other , fleeting interests			0
this month , as we stop to appreciate and celebrate the efforts of generations past , we know that our reach towards meaningful equality -- that goal that justice @entity221 once called only a " distant dream " -- grows stronger with each voter registered and every ballot cast			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity227 .			2

amendment passed after @entity34 was supposed to guarantee former slaves right to vote
in reality , states found ways to deny people voting rights , says @entity227
passage of the @entity17 in 1965 finally ensured the right to vote , she says
@entity227 : states today are fashioning new ways to deny voting rights
