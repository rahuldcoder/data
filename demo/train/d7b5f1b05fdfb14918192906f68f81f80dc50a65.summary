@entity1 apologized wednesday for his off the cuff remarks at an official dinner , but the @entity10 's equipment and clothing sponsor @entity8 has gone public with its displeasure over the remarks			1
" @entity1 's recent comment was offensive and in no way aligns with @entity8 's values and corporate culture , " said a statement released by the company			1
its long standing backing of former @entity21 stretches back to 2002 but appears to have been placed under strain over the controversy			0
" we have spoken with @entity1 directly and he clearly has regret for his statement and we believe he is sincere			2
" we discussed with @entity1 that his comments are clearly out of bounds and we are continuing to review the matter , " it concluded			1

@entity33 claimed that many of @entity1 's friends were " colored athletes " and has since apologized			1
he said : " i deeply regret using an inappropriate word in a live interview for @entity42 , for which i unreservedly apologize			0
" @entity1 , who finished with a level par 72 in his first round of the @entity34 's flagship @entity45 at @entity46 , was clad from head to foot in the products of his biggest sponsor			1
but he has admitted that the racist row which exploded after his comments had left him severely distracted			1
" it was tough to hit a shot ( in the pro-am ) without thinking about it , " the 33 - year - old told gathered reporters			0
@entity1 has had an uneasy relationship with @entity4 for a number of years and it deteriorated to an all - time low after the @entity34 's annual dinner tuesday night			1
answering questions from the media , he was asked if he would invite his @entity64 rival to dinner at next month 's @entity66			2
@entity1 quipped he would have him round every night and serve fried chicken , a remark associated with racial stereo typing when used in reference to @entity72			1
@entity4 responded on his twitter account , saying the comments were " hurtful and inappropriate " but later tried to diffuse the row			1
" i 'm confident that there is real regret that the remark was made			0
" @entity78 ended nearly two weeks ago and it 's long past time to move on and talk about golf			2
" woods , who won the @entity78 , was involved in a spat with @entity1 after the third round at @entity84 -- where they were paired together			2
@entity1 claimed he was disturbed by @entity4 as he hit a shot and later admitted his relationship with the 14 - time major winner was strained			1
" you ca n't like everyone , " he said			0
the saga echoes a 1997 incident after @entity4 won his first @entity93 title			2
former masters champion @entity94 was asked what choice @entity4 might make at the major 's annual dinner the following year -- as would be his right as the holder			2
" you pat him on the back and say congratulations and enjoy it and tell him not serve fried chicken next year			1
got it ? or collard greens or whatever the hell they serve			0
" @entity94 's reputation took a battering in the row that followed and despite issuing an apology , which @entity4 accepted , he also later shed a key sponsorship deal with @entity114			1
on the course , @entity116 's @entity115 ended the first day at the top of the leaderboard after carding a six - under 66			2
@entity115 , who lost his card last season , hit four birdies in his final seven holes			0
" you are not automatically invited into most of these events , so it 's tough to plan your schedule , " he told reporters after carving out a one - shot lead over @entity127 's @entity126			0
" it takes one good week and things change , so i am hoping to make the best of this week			0
@entity137 @entity136 endured a disappointing day , finishing the day on two - over par following his round of 74			0
he told reporters : " it was tricky			0
the conditions obviously were not ideal , so it is tough to shoot a low score out there			0
i felt i was doing well after the first 12 holes but i just let the round get away from me			0
" in the first 12 holes i did n't really miss a shot , but i am not getting as much out of my rounds as i should do			0
