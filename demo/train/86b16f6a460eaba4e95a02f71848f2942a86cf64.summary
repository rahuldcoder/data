editor 's note : @entity2 worked for former house speaker @entity3 and other @entity4 in @entity5			1
he is president of @entity6 , a @entity7 - based advocacy firm that has represented clients that include @entity9 , @entity10 and the @entity11			2
he formerly was a government relations executive vice president for the @entity12			2
@entity2 says he 's proud @entity13 won the @entity14 , but now the president needs to earn it			1
@entity7 ( @entity17 ) -- usually , when a president wins the @entity14 , it is uniformly seen as a positive development for @entity21 and for the world			2
both opponents and allies tend to celebrate the fact that an @entity21 president actually got recognized by a bunch of @entity28 for something he achieved			2
but with @entity13 , who surprisingly picked up his first @entity31 on friday , the reaction was not altogether positive from either the left or the right			1
you would expect that conservatives would raise questions about the president 's award			1
conservatives raise questions about everything the president does			0
but liberals also joined in			0
@entity44 of @entity45 said that the president should say thanks , but no thanks			0
" turn it down ! politely decline			0
say he 's honored but he has n't had the time yet to accomplish what he wants to accomplish			1
" liberal columnist @entity52 wrote a mocking column , comparing @entity13 's award to a fictional award given to @entity56 for promising to " read a book someday			1
" we are all glad that @entity28 loves @entity13 , but come on			1
i am reminded of when @entity62 owner @entity61 decided to retire the jersey of longtime @entity62 player @entity64			0
it was a little premature for @entity64 to get his uniform retired when he himself was playing for another team			0
( @entity64 played a couple more years , surely the only instance where a player 's uniform was retired before the player was			0
) awarding @entity13 the @entity14 is similarly premature			1
in fact , the @entity73 seemed as surprised as anybody about the gesture			0
i imagine that when @entity13 first picked up the line , he thought it was a crank call			1
" i won what ? " he must have exclaimed			0
but it is no joke			0
it seems that president @entity13 won his first @entity14 , for , well , being president @entity13			1
just the very idea of a president @entity13 is enough to make the @entity86 swoon			1
the president said he was humbled by this award			0
to paraphrase @entity89 , he has much to be humble about			0
when it comes to peace , it is hard to see what notable accomplishments have been achieved thus far in the @entity13 presidency			1
that is not a slap at him			0
it took @entity100 and @entity101 about 30 years of really hard and dangerous work in @entity103 before they got a @entity14			0
and despite all of that hard work , peace and reconciliation is still elusive in that region			1
mr. @entity13 has n't even been able to get a peace deal between @entity109 and @entity110 , who continue to snipe at each other over the health care public option and @entity113			1
peace has n't exactly broken out in @entity114 , @entity113 , @entity115 , @entity116 , or @entity117 either			2
@entity31 usually go for some fairly notable accomplishments			1
@entity119 spent much of his life protesting apartheid and serving a prison sentence			0
he is a man who deserved a peace prize			2
@entity124 allowed the @entity125 to collapse without much of a whimper			0
that was an accomplishment that deserved a peace prize			2
but what exactly has president @entity13 done to deserve such an award ? and if he actually does something in the future , does that mean he gets another one ? apparently , the voting on the peace prize started shortly after the president was sworn in			1
perhaps he is getting the peace prize because of his inaugural address			2
yep , a lot of people came to that speech , and peace mostly reigned on that day ( except for those people with tickets to the @entity145 who got stuck in the " purple tunnel " in @entity7 )			0
but i do n't think he deserves a peace prize for that			1
i guess he got the prize because he was elected president and he was n't @entity153			1
well , if that is the case , maybe all of those millions of @entity21 who voted for him should share the prize , because they actually did most of the work			2
as an @entity21 , i am proud that our president was awarded a @entity14			0
now , i , like many others on the right and the left , would like to see him do something to earn it			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			2

@entity2 : @entity13 's @entity31 win surprised the right , the left , @entity13 himself
hard to see any notable achievements for peace by @entity13 so far , @entity2 says
he says @entity13 won because he was elected president and was n't @entity153
@entity13 voters should share the prize , because they elected him , @entity2 says
