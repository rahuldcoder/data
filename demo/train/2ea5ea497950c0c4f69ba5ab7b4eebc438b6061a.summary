-- my @entity2 feed is suddenly depleted of the usual smiling selfies and is now raging with photos , videos and links to news articles about the war going on between @entity10 and the @entity12 military			1
everyone , it seems , has become their own curator of the news about this conflict			1
many of the posts in my feed are about the media bias much of my family and friends perceive in the coverage			1
a much clearer - cut bias , though , is the one your @entity2 feed might have			2
some jews and @entity30 on @entity2 may have noticed that their own feeds are replete with stories sympathetic to " one side " and possibly even hostile to the other side			2
as a journalist , it feels encouraging to see people so enthralled with the news of our times that they 're compelled to share it with everyone they know			1
but as a 28 - year - old who knows plenty of my friends get their news only through their @entity2 feed , i 'm concerned			1
i do n't fault @entity2 for creating an algorithm that feeds us the stories we 're most likely to " like " and share , based on what our friends are already liking and sharing			0
undoubtedly , the attempt by @entity2 engineers to keep us more engaged with our feed never intended to affect the balance of @entity63 news coverage			1
yet , i do worry that many of my of friends are seeing the news of this entire conflict only through a @entity2 filter inadvertently biased against @entity12 or biased against @entity68 , depending on your circle of friends and family			1
my fear is that they 're no longer seeing the variety of reports from seasoned correspondents who go to painstaking lengths to give a complete and encompassing account of the stories in both in @entity12 and @entity68			0
@entity2 , on the other hand , is programmed to feed up the news from one side : your friends ' perspectives			1
" it 's not just @entity2 , " @entity86 , author of the " @entity87 , " warned in his ted talk about the dangers of a customized @entity90			0
@entity86 points out that a simple @entity93 search of " @entity94 , " for example , will generate a completely different result and even different news articles customized for each user			1
" there 's a whole host of companies that are doing this kind of personalization			0
@entity104 , the biggest news site on the @entity90 , is now personalized			2
different people get different things , " @entity86 said			2
" this moves us very quickly toward a world in which the @entity90 is showing us what it thinks we want to see , but not necessarily what we need to see			0
" for every person posting a story sympathetic to " their " side , they should take a moment to contemplate that someone else 's @entity2 feed is likely filled with the stories with the opposite bias			0
this week , i interviewed the two university students who started the @entity2 page and hashtag " @entity126			0
" one is an @entity12 jew and the other a @entity129 - born @entity128			0
they said they were inspired to create the social media campaign , in part , because of the often vitriolic nature of what they 've seen posted about @entity12 or the @entity137 on their own feeds			1
for many people , the one - sidedness of their @entity2 feed might actually be a sign of something they 're missing far beyond their feed : a lack of friendships they have across religious and ethnic lines			2
a few of my friends have even written status updates saying that they 've defriended people on @entity2 or been defriended for posting opposing views about this war			2
muslims defriending @entity157 and vice versa -- just making the @entity2 feed even more biased and insular from an opposing perspective or a shared news story which may be hard for one side to stomach			1
i admit that there are many important and intriguing stories about the war i 've come across through my feed			0
social media offer a slice of the story , but they just ca n't provide a holistic understanding of the news , much less the @entity63			1
watching a newscast or reading a newspaper 's website seems even more essential now to ensure you 're confronting the opinions and reports that challenge your own perceptions and your friends ' convictions			0
i just hope my friends will spend the time reading and watching the nuanced stories from credible journalists as they do from the friends on their @entity2 feed			0
if not , what 's arguably the world 's most intractable conflict may only be seen by many through the world 's largest echo chamber .			0

concern that people are seeing news only via social media filter
and they may be getting only one perspective
this is playing out in current @entity63 *crisis*
