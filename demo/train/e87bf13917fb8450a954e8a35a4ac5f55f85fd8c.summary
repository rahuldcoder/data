-- it is widely agreed that wednesday night 's presidential debate is crucial for @entity3 : this is almost assuredly his last chance to turn around the election			1
what is less obvious is that the stakes are sky - high for @entity9 , too : this debate could have a powerful impact upon his ability to govern in a second term			1
@entity3 is dangerously close to blowing a campaign that many election models said he should easily win			1
yes , three national polls published monday -- including @entity0 -- showed the two candidates within three points of each other			0
but for @entity3 , the problem is that as the polls go up and down each week , there is one constant : as @entity26 demonstrates in its averaging process , @entity9 stays ahead and has been for nearly a year			1
the news for the @entity29 from battleground states is even worse , especially in the @entity31			0
unless he wants to depend on a wing and a prayer , @entity3 is thus in the unenviable position that he has to shake up the dynamics of the race on wednesday night			1
translated , that means he has to score a convincing victory in the eyes of voters			0
simply being as good as @entity9 wo n't cut it -- a tie goes to the leader			2
how to watch , clip and share the debate can @entity3 pull off a debate victory ? of course -- umm , theoretically			1
as he proved in the @entity29 debates , he is quick on his feet , can throw a punch as well as counterpunch , and he looks presidential -- all assets on television			0
but his campaign has left him with so much ground to make up that it will be very hard : in the space of 90 minutes , he has to convince voters for the first time that he has a better plan for the economy , make the case that @entity9 does n't and prove much more likable than ever before			2
and all the while , he will have to fend off jabs from @entity9 , who can draw from a rich trove of @entity3 mistakes in the past			1
so , yes , @entity3 can still win , but it will be darn hard			2
no wonder he has been practicing so much			0
it would appear , then , that @entity9 can simply go for caution , choosing a clinch in the center of the ring over hard punches , and walking away with a tie			0
but on closer examination , @entity9 ought to be pressing for a victory , too			2
opinion : debate coach -- @entity9 , @entity3 are top performers in some polls over recent weeks , especially from key states , the president has now opened up a second possible path to re-election			1
for a long time , his campaign advisers have assumed that he would win but that his margin of victory would be narrow -- less than three points			0
even now , his advisers -- even as they are quietly confident about the ultimate outcome -- are running scared , assuming the race will likely close significantly in the final weeks			0
but it is becoming apparent there is another possibility : contrary to much conventional wisdom , @entity9 may actually be able to bust open this race , sweeping almost every state he won four years ago and rolling up a victory margin of perhaps five points or more			1
opinion : ten questions for @entity9 to answer the difference between a big win and a small win for @entity9 is , to draw upon a famous @entity106 phrase , almost the difference between lightning and a lightning bug			2
looking beyond november , what really matters to @entity9 is whether he can effectively govern in a second term			2
if he wins big , he can persuasively argue that the @entity113 people have spoken loudly and clearly , choosing his path into the future over @entity3 's			1
at minimum , he will claim a mandate in favor of higher taxes on the affluent , a strong safety net for those in trouble and a cautious approach toward reducing @entity120 , @entity121 and @entity122 costs			0
republicans will have a much harder time challenging his mandate if he wins big			0
moreover , a big @entity9 victory would keep the @entity131 safely in @entity133 hands and -- less likely -- might put a few @entity135 seats in play			1
@entity9 campaign advisers have been building a powerful ground game for months ; they have far more offices in battleground states than @entity3			1
their hope is that if they turn out enough voters , a rising tide will lift lots of boats downstream			0
especially in the @entity131 , they entertain hopes that a @entity133 candidate can come within three points of @entity9			0
if he were to break beyond 53 % in key states , that could elect a lot of @entity133			0
add together the possibility of a convincing mandate with congressional results that may be far better than expected a few months ago and what do you have : bingo , a resurgent @entity9 heading toward a second term			2
to some of his advisers , that would make it far more likely he could achieve a " grand bargain " on deficits , breaking open the deadlock now paralyzing @entity165 and holding back corporate investment			0
opinion : the mistakes candidates make in debates in short , @entity9 has a great deal riding on wednesday 's debate , too			1
members of his team may talk as if they have less at stake than their opponent , but in their hearts , they know that if @entity9 can put @entity3 away in their first debate , he could well have some lightning at his command in a second term			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity185 .			0

@entity185 : debate may represent @entity3 's last big chance to turn around the race
he says the stakes are also sky - high for @entity9 , even if he wins election
@entity9 needs a big victory to claim broad support for his plans for second term , @entity185 says
