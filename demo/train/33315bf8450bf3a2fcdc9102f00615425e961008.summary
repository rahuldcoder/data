@entity0 -- thank the @entity2 for @entity3			0
before this week , few @entity4 would have known of him			1
but this week , he has catapulted himself to national sainthood , winning @entity4 's second gold medal , this one in sailing			1
@entity4 has been in distress since the @entity10 began , watching a parlous performance in the pool where it usually performs exceedingly well			1
but there has been no @entity16 haul of gold for the country 's swimmers in @entity20 ; just one gold in the women 's 4 x 100 freestyle relay event , and nothing for the individual swims			1
@entity26 : what 's your @entity2 story ? as a result , this sporting nation has been thrown into an identity crisis of sorts , played out in public as a tussle over what it means to be @entity4			1
there are those who argue a poor gold medal tally is an appalling reflection of @entity4 's sporting prowess and an even worse for its self - esteem , playing out as it has on the international stage			1
worse still , at number 19 in the gold medals table , it lags painfully behind @entity49 whose sporting achievements @entity4 likes to think it has and can always trump			1
and , for many @entity4 , the distinct possibility that @entity53 might walk away from this @entity54 with more medals would be too much to bear			1
read more : @entity56 tops golden night for @entity57 and there 's the more sober view that sees getting to the @entity10 at all -- let alone winning lots of silver -- as an achievement			2
in this camp , being gracious losers is as important as being great winners			0
and that @entity4 's great hope , @entity67 missed gold in the 100 meters freestyle by 1/100th of a second is to be worn as a badge of honor : we were that good			1
so furious has the public flogging of @entity4 's performance been , that long jumper @entity75 who walked away with a silver medal for his efforts , gave the media a blast			1
" i think people need to start understanding that it is not easy to win an @entity83 and there is absolutely nothing wrong with a silver medal , " said @entity75			1
the problem , as @entity75 sees it , is that the media views silver and bronze as disappointing results			2
" the team is happy , the coach is happy			0
i got thousands of messages [ from ] back home that they are happy			0
the only people that are not happy are you guys			0
so you need to wake up , " he admonished			0
still the critics are not silenced			0
as @entity3 won gold for the laser class single - handed dinghies sailing event and @entity4 looked guaranteed to win another gold on the water , the headlines have been kinder but carry barely disguised missives of shame			1
read more : numbers behind 2012 @entity10 " sailors come to @entity4 's @entity2 rescue " blared @entity112 online			1
" between them the sailors could spare the blushes of an @entity4 contingent that has been performing solidly without being able to convert seconds and thirds into @entity2 titles			2
" and there was this from @entity124 ! @entity125 : " @entity126 defends @entity4 's medal haul , " in which hurdler @entity128 echoed @entity75 's frustration with local disappointment			1
across the @entity132 , there was the anticipated barb : " @entity4 back to its old self with gold "			1
the near empty satchel of gold has inspired a review of @entity4 's swimming performance			1
ordered by swimming @entity4 , at its head will be former national head coach @entity141 and olympian @entity142			2
the aim will be to come up with a formula to prevent another national humiliation at the @entity146 in @entity147 in two years time			0
but more than this , the aim will be to find out what went wrong in @entity20			2
was it team disunity ? or too much pre-event tweeting ? maybe the work ethic of the current crop is n't what it should be ? are the best of @entity4 's swimming coaches being lured by big dollars to train @entity160 nationals ? and a seemingly ridiculous question : should bearded swimmers be compelled to shave ? could it have been @entity165 's beard that ended his run for gold ? it is all open to investigation , though @entity142 says there 'll be no witch - hunt			1
in a nation accustomed to winning in sport , expectations are invariably high			2
rarely is the concomitant pressure on competitors taken into account			0
as @entity183 winner @entity182 has found , the weight of great expectation on your shoulders , is a viscerally grueling pressure			0
bundled out in the first round at the @entity186 , before an audience expecting her to win after her @entity189 triumph , took its toll			2
" for sure it affects you physically , that 's probably the easiest sign for the outside people to see , " she told a media conference after her loss			0
" i think it is easy to see that you tighten up , your shoulders do get tight , you do n't hit through the ball			0
" @entity165 , head buried in hands as he digested his loss , put it this way : " you come to the realization that i would 've preferred a different colored medal but the funny thing is that all i wanted to do after the race was see my parents			0
'' you start to get a realization of what is important			0
everything 's come so easy for me early in my career and i 've taken it for granted , " he said			0
the president of the @entity218 @entity217 believes the problem is not one of high expectations			0
that comes with the turf in elite sports			0
for @entity217 , the @entity20 problem might be eradicated in the future by reintroducing compulsory school sports			2
though he warned last november that not enough money was flowing to the state - administered sports institutes to ensure the expected 45 medal haul in @entity20 , @entity217 does n't think funding is an issue in @entity4 swimming			1
" i think there is enough money in the system , they 're just not necessarily spending it wisely , " he told local media			1
the highest ranked @entity4 on the @entity240 @entity239 begs to differ			2
@entity241 , he says , is the difference between gold and silver			0
the post mortem will be painful			0
if anyone is hoping it will be long as well , it is the prime minister @entity247 , who 's parlous political position and poor polling has been off the front pages as the nation licks the wounds of a dented ego .			0

@entity4 is currently 19th on the gold medal table with just two golds
failure to win medals in @entity20 has prompted soul - searching
*athletes* have criticized local media for putting emphasis on winning gold
