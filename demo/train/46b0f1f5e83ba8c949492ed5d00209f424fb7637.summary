@entity0 -- she may be out of @entity3 and on the road for the week , but the heavy machinery of office has followed secretary of state @entity7 to @entity0 as she attends the annual @entity10 meetings			1
to be sure , the secretary always has a traveling staff with her wherever she may be in the world			2
but @entity10 , with its hundreds of diplomats , ministers and heads of state converging on @entity0 every september , is a much different animal from a trip to a world capitol			1
basically , @entity21 moves up to the @entity22 and sets up a @entity23 on the 24th floor of the @entity25			1
@entity1 was granted rare and exclusive access to this massive operation , one that involves hundreds of employees , planeloads full of equipment and a ton of coffee			0
as we exited the elevator on the 24th floor , it became clear this was indeed a secure work space , with numerous diplomatic security guards and several signs reminding staff not to discuss classified information in the hallways			0
it seemed as if @entity46 foreign policy had n't skipped a beat despite being a few hundred miles removed from home base			0
with the beds in each room removed ( though the head boards where still bolted to the wall ) , the rooms have been transformed into working offices with secure telephone lines , computers , fax machines and all of the equipment needed to do the job of executing the nation 's diplomacy			2
as we were escorted down one of the halls , @entity62 , the department 's chief of protocol , was working with her staff to prepare for what was already shaping up to be an marathon of a week			1
@entity70 's office is responsible for advising on matters of international diplomatic protocol , making sure the right atmosphere is created for conducting diplomacy			2
even though @entity70 was congratulating the staff for an earlier event that went off successfully , staff members have a long week ahead assuring there are no diplomatic glitches when president @entity80 and @entity7 meet with many of their counterparts			2
helping manage protocol for more than 190 @entity85 member states is a juggling act @entity70 's protocol team has to perfect every @entity10			1
every regional office , such as the @entity89 , the @entity90 , and the @entity91 , which oversees the @entity92 , had taken over a room or two and had staff busy working the phones trying to set up meetings for @entity7 while she is in town			0
@entity99 with international organization affairs -- the bureau responsible for managing the @entity46 relationship with @entity10 and all other international organizations -- said the pressure of managing the week 's itinerary was more like " finals week " in college , except that it would be the entire world grading his office 's performance as opposed to a lone professor			1
despite the enormity of the task at hand , some of his staff was already at work preparing for next year 's @entity10			1
@entity118 set up @entity7 's executive office at the @entity25			1
he said brought " a lot " of people up from @entity3 to make sure the secretary had everything at her disposal to operate effectively			0
special agent @entity125 of the @entity126 has an office set up to oversee the security for @entity7 as she travels around @entity0 for her meetings , as well as the security for all other non-head of state dignitaries			1
@entity125 says he has to create " a protective bubble " so the @entity133 can move into a hotel building where employees can handle and discuss sensitive information the department needs in order to function			1
@entity125 's work also extends to the 34th floor of the @entity25 , the floor where @entity80 and @entity7 will hold bilateral meetings with their counterparts this week			1
a separate staff works on the 34th floor , preparing the room where @entity7 would be meeting with the @entity149 and @entity150 foreign ministers , and the pool of reporters who would shuffle in to ask questions and take pictures of the two shaking hands			0
@entity156 works on 34th floor setting up the " bi-lat " room			0
each has what looks like an ordinary conference table dressed up with flowers , but @entity156 explains how every name card , glass of water and pencil is placed just so , according to diplomatic procedure established under former secretary of state @entity168			0
back on 24 , the @entity169 is busy preparing briefing books of information for @entity7 to cover the subject of every meeting on her daily schedule			0
@entity176 , a senior support specialist in the office , said he expected to go through 40 to 50 cases of paper this week to prepare the books			2
many of the rooms had the large brown " burn bags " -- the final destination for much of that paper -- in which the shredded remains of sensitive documents are placed before they are burned			1
down the hall in room @entity191 , members of the press are getting ready for @entity7 's " photo - op " with the @entity149 foreign minister			0
bomb dogs are sniffing cameras and @entity196 is rounding up the journalists and cameramen			0
@entity196 has been running these photo ops for decades			0
it 's not just shuffling the press into a room : @entity196 spends months advancing the site , making sure the media gets a good shot to illustrate the diplomacy secretaries of state are conducting			0
@entity208 , a veteran @entity133 reporter , says @entity10 week is always a big hassle because of the famous @entity0 traffic , but it 's a good opportunity to see lots of sources and get a better sense of the full diplomatic picture			1
@entity208 is well - known for his tough questions , but he says he would n't be doing his job if he did n't push the @entity133 to explain how all the meetings here at @entity10 translate in to @entity46 foreign policy			1
as we take the freight elevator up to the 34th floor and wait in a elevator vestibule , reporters are discussing what question to toss out to @entity7			0
along with @entity226 from @entity227 , we ask @entity7 about her hopes to avert a showdown with @entity231 president @entity230 at the @entity232 over the @entity231 statehood issue			0
usually @entity7 does n't speak at the photo - ops , but she had a message to deliver : the @entity46 does n't think action at the @entity10 will lead to a peace deal and she hopes to find a compromise before @entity230 ' speech on friday			2
it 's not breaking news , but reporters fly back down to 24m file the comments for their outlets			0
as @entity80 and @entity7 continue a whirlwind schedule of meetings and dinners , the frenetic pace of work will continue on the 24th floor of the @entity25			1
when @entity7 leaves the secure lines will be removed and the sensitive documents destroyed , and a new set of guests will take their place			2

@entity10 week brings the world to @entity0
the @entity25 hosts the huge @entity133 contingent
it 's no easy process setting up the meetings that will take place
@entity268 of paper go into producing documents , many of which are later burned
