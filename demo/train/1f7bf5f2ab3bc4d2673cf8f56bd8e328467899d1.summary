@entity0 , @entity1 -- filmmaker @entity3 has a phd in zoology and three decades of experience filming and photographing wildlife			1
yet when it came to predicting the behavior of the lions and cheetahs of @entity13 's @entity12 , all that proved of little use			1
" you 're constantly surprised , " he said			0
" when you start following wild animals , you 're initially an incredible expert			0
and the more you follow them , you realize you 're less and less of an expert			0
" for his new film " @entity22 , " @entity3 led a film crew documenting the lives of individual lions and cheetahs over the course of two and a half years			1
" the only thing we had control over was the selection of the characters -- we had no control over the plot , " says @entity3			0
the @entity36 film , which is narrated by sir @entity37 , debuted in the @entity38 wednesday , with a royal premiere attended by the @entity40 and @entity41			1
the @entity40 gave a speech calling for an end to wildlife poaching in @entity45 after the screening			0
describing their filming routine , @entity3 said each morning , the crew would wake in their camp before dawn , and set out to where they had left the cats the night before			1
if they managed to find them , the crew would then follow their adventures through the 1510 - square - kilometer reserve , one of the few remaining places where the three big @entity45 cats -- lions , cheetahs and leopards -- live in large numbers and in close proximity			1
it led them to unforgettable sights -- all captured in high definition and slow motion -- as the animals engaged in rivalries and constant struggles for sustenance and survival , earning the movie a billing as the " real - life ' @entity78 '			1
" " the most remarkable scene was two lions swimming across the flooded @entity81 and one being taken by a croc and getting away , " recalled @entity3			1
" we did n't know crocs would go for lions -- and now we know			2
you can see why lions are really unhappy to go in that river			2
" as the crew followed their subjects , the animals ' individual personalities gradually revealed themselves			1
" you do n't want to anthropomorphize , yet they do have distinct personalities that come out , " said @entity94 , the movie 's principal photographer			1
some were brave , others cowards			0
some were leaders , others followers			0
and some had developed specialist skills -- like the lioness who had mastered a unique technique for suffocating her prey -- that others lacked			0
as a species , lions also had their own particular character -- dramatic , charismatic , and occasionally unintentionally comic -- which the crew grew to appreciate			2
" there 's nothing funnier than a lion doing a pratfall , " said @entity110			2
explained specialist photographer @entity115 : " it 's their -- sometimes false -- sense of confidence , in everything			2
they do n't think they can put a foot wrong and they frequently do , and it 's amusing to watch			2
" the crew were safe observing the animals -- sometimes at extremely close quarters -- from the sanctuary of their vehicles , although lions and elephants sometimes wandered through their camps at night			2
on one occasion , a bull elephant , drawn to a fruiting tree , rolled over one of the crew 's vehicles that had been parked nearby			0
generally though , their presence did not bother the animals , who were used to vehicles entering the reserve			0
" do they care ? some of the time we 're undoubtedly an asset , because we 're shade on a hot day , " said @entity115			0
" in the past i 've had 13 lions under my car			0
they 're very flatulent , and then they try to bite the brake tubes			0
" the film 's producers hope that by engaging audiences in the real - life narratives of the great cats , they can encourage people to protect the species			1
cheetahs , the world 's fastest land animals , are endangered , while lions are classified as vulnerable			1
" it 's important not to convey a finger wagging message in every single production because that would be counterproductive , " said @entity115			0
" a movie like this is a celebration of other lives that i hope will get people thinking , so when they next hear that tigers , lions , cheetahs , elephants , rhino are under threat , they do something about it			1

" @entity22 " is a new film documenting the lives of @entity13 's lions and cheetahs
the filmmakers spent more than two years following the great cats as they struggled to survive
during the course of filming , they got to know the distinct personalities of their subjects
they hope the film , billed as a " real - life @entity78 , " will spur audiences ' *interest* in *conservation*
