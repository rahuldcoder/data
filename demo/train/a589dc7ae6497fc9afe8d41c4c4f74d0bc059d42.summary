it used to be that an event had to be truly momentous to warrant a new holiday -- be it the birth of a prophet or a hard - won battle for statehood			1
but these days all that 's needed to craft a commemorative day is good dose of ingenuity and a marketing plan			1
in case you missed it , last week we had take your houseplant for a @entity17 and next week ( august 7 ) we can all look forward to @entity18 and @entity19			2
indeed , one man alone is probably responsible for most of the world 's more ridiculous holidays			1
@entity24 @entity23 has invented -- and copyrighted -- over 90 holidays in the last 26 years , including @entity26 ( may 8 ) and married to a @entity27 ( november 18 )			1
but when he first started brainstorming silly things to celebrate , he had no idea that some of his inventions would one day make it onto calendars and diaries			1
he certainly did n't imagine that anyone would observe them			2
" i just started doing it on a lark , " admits @entity23 , who used to flip through @entity37 -- an annual reference guide to holidays around the world -- to get ideas for the morning radio show he hosted out of @entity43 , @entity44			1
one year , he noticed a form in the back of the book inviting readers to submit their own holidays			1
" i was like , ' oh no , do n't tell me this is possible , ' " he recalls			2
for fun , he crafted @entity55 -- @entity23 's answer to curing cabin fever			1
on february 20 , observers are meant to hit the streets at noon and shout , " hoodie hoo "			0
to his surprise , the holiday was printed in the next edition			1
it was n't long before various media got a hold of it and started promoting the day as a fun , off - the - wall thing to do			1
shortly afterward , the letters started coming in			2
@entity23 received invitations to @entity55 celebrations			1
occasionally , corporations pay him to use some of his creations			0
a few years ago , @entity74 used his eat what you want day in one of their ad campaigns			0
" it was kind of scary , " he says			0
" this is how politicians get into office with these nonsensical ideas , and people buy into it			0
" in 1985 , @entity89 @entity88 wanted an excuse to have a monthly party			0
she invented @entity92 , which she celebrated on any day that matched the month ( i.e , january 1 , february 2 ... )			0
though @entity95 passed away in 1995 , her sister , @entity94 , carried on the tradition , and the holiday has achieved a cult status in @entity89			2
official holidays do n't always follow logic , either			2
@entity101 has a law that states that when two holidays fall with a day between them , the middle day becomes a de facto holiday			1
according to @entity108 , a spokesperson for the @entity109 , it 's recognized that some holidays are mainly an excuse for the populace to take time off			1
" @entity101 people tend to be hesitant to use their annual leave , " she admits			0

though special interest groups often spearhead these initiatives , sometimes a day is granted importance just because a particularly enthusiastic individual thinks it should be			0
@entity125 could be one of the most dedicated lefties in the world			0
he runs an online shop -- founded as a brick - and - mortar storefront in @entity130 by his left - handed father in 1967 -- called @entity133			0
though hard to prove , he strongly suspects @entity135 creator @entity134 -- himself a leftie -- used the store as his basis for @entity140 ' shop , the @entity141			0
several years ago , @entity125 founded @entity142 , and shortly started receiving queries about starting a holiday to support left - handed people			1
he launched @entity146 on august 13 , 1992			0
the date was picked to coincide with a slow news cycle so that it would have a better shot at garnering some media attention			0
" 250,000 people visited our site on the day last year			0
unfortunately , that does n't always convert into orders , " says @entity125			0
" while there 's a lot of interest in left - handed products , there 's also a lot of apathy			2
" read more : why solstice stirs libidos still , he 's been contacted by dozens of people who have concocted their own @entity169 ' day celebrations			2
" it tends to be people converting their spaces in to ' lefty - only ' zones			0
we 've heard of people who own pubs and make a rule where everyone has to drink with their left hand that day			0
it 's fairly low - key , " he admits			2
ultimately , though , the true test of a holiday 's validity is if it gets its own greeting card			1
while @entity187 denies creating holidays , the company says it employs a team of 600 to research events worth celebrating			1
while @entity187 is n't making @entity55 cards yet , this year it started making @entity194 e-cards			1
" we 've seen the demand for that rise out of social media , " says @entity187 spokesperson @entity195 , who adds that customers were creating their own " may the @entity198 " e-cards through the @entity187 site			1
the company decided to follow suit			0
" people seem to really like that phrase , " she says .			0
