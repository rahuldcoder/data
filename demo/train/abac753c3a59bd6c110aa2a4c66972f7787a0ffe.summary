-- the long debate on same - sex marriage is coming to an end			1
a plurality of @entity5 now support same - sex marriage ; the figure is 63 % among voters under 30			1
the rest is just a matter of time			0
the end of the same - sex marriage debate does not , however , settle the problem of marriage in @entity16			1
among the 95 % to 97 % of @entity5 who are not gay , the institution of marriage continues to weaken -- with ominous consequences for the next generation			1
about 40 % of all the babies born in the @entity5 are born to unmarried women			1
just about everybody agrees that this is a worrying development			1
as candidate @entity25 told a @entity27 church in 2008 : " ( c ) hildren who grow up without a father are five times more likely to live in poverty and commit crime , nine times more likely to drop out of schools , and 20 times more likely to end up in prison			2
they are more likely to have behavioral problems , or run away from home or become teenage parents themselves			0
and the foundations of our community are weaker because of it			0
" of course there are exceptions to every rule			0
on average , however , children born to unmarried women do worse in all kinds of important ways compared to children born to married couples			1
they are less likely to complete their schooling , more likely to get in trouble with the law , more likely to have children out of marriage themselves , less likely to achieve upward mobility			1
the data behind these claims are overwhelming , and not seriously contested by any social scientist -- although every once in a while , somebody will publish an article " in defense of single motherhood " that brusquely dismisses the evidence with @entity67 style elan : " i am not a huge believer in studies			0
" same - sex couples take long road to the altar for those who do believe in social science , the question arises : what to do ? and here 's where the looming end of the debate over same - sex marriage offers real hope			1
last week , the @entity85 published a major statement in the @entity87			0
signed by 74 luminaries of widely diverse political points of view , it called for a " new conversation about marriage			2
" " the current question is , should gays marry ? the new question is , who among us , gay or straight , wants to strengthen marriage ? " the statement asked			2
the @entity85 is known as a conservative group			0
in recent years , its leader , @entity102 , has reconsidered his past opposition to same - sex marriage			1
this rethinking has cost @entity85 and @entity102 dearly			0
board members have resigned , funding sources have been cut			0
yet at breakfast two weeks ago in @entity109 , @entity102 was undaunted			0
the challenges that led him into the marriage debate two decades ago have only become more urgent			2
as the @entity85 writes : " ( m ) arriage trends in @entity16 , particularly among the nearly 60 percent of @entity5 who 've graduated from high school but do not have a four - year college degree , are more and more resembling the historic marriage trends in poor and low - income @entity16			1
" in other words , the middle - class family increasingly looks like the lower - class family -- at an economic moment when it is very easy to tumble out of the middle class and increasingly difficult to climb into it			1
" in the wake of the @entity128 and in the midst of severe and possibly long - lasting economic challenges to our society , we propose a new conversation that re-establishes the link between marriage and money , the nest and the nest - egg			1
what economic policies strengthen marriage ? what marriage policies create wealth ? in the new conversation , marriage and thrift , the two great engines of the @entity5 middle class since the nation 's founding , stand best when they stand together			1
" the @entity5 is becoming an increasingly class - stratified society			1
the few at the top enjoy unprecedented affluence			0
the many in the middle and at the bottom face narrowing opportunities and declining standards of living			0
the dwindling of marriage is both cause and consequence of @entity16 's evolution away from a society of equal chances			0
the restoration of marriage is crucial to reviving the middle class and offering hope to the poor			0
marriage means two incomes at a time when most @entity5 find two incomes essential to earning a middle - class livelihood			1
marriage secures the active presence of fathers in children 's lives			2
marriage means more asset accumulation : married families save more at every income level			0
marriage means fewer accidents and illnesses , less stress , and more happiness and personal fulfillment			0
yet even as we reach a new social consensus about marriage 's importance , marriage seems to have become increasingly elusive , difficult , and uncertain			2
it 's time for all @entity5 , left and right , gay and straight , to join @entity102 's " new conversation			2
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity202 .			2

@entity5 , particularly those under 30 , increasingly support same - sex marriage
@entity202 says the more pressing issue nationally is how to restore the role of marriage
four of every 10 children are born to unmarried women , a worrying development , he says
@entity216 : marriage *improves* economic prospects and *education* , reduces crime
