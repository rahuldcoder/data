-- a federal scuba - diving team conducting a training dive in a @entity5 canal last week made a grisly discovery -- a human skull , authorities said tuesday			1
the team was conducting routine training january 5 in the @entity10 when a diver discovered the skull in about 15 to 20 feet of water , said @entity14 , a spokeswoman for @entity15			2
an initial assessment by the @entity18 determined the skull probably belonged to a black male , 25 to 45 years old , @entity16 said			0
the time and cause of death could not immediately be determined			0
the @entity24 medical examiner 's office took custody of the skull for investigation			1
a spokesman for the medical examiner said that in addition to looking for evidence of homicide , suicide , accidental death or natural death , his examiners also will consult with a local expert on @entity39 religions			1
" periodically , human skulls found in our jurisdiction are traced to @entity45 or @entity46 source , " said spokesman @entity40			1
published accounts say adherents of those religions have disinterred remains for religious rituals , and @entity40 said customs officials at airport ports of entry sometimes discover skulls being brought in for that purpose			2
" in many of these cases identification is never made , and thus the skulls find a permanent home in our anthropology room , " he said			0
but , he said , " at this point we have not proceeded real far with our investigation , " and no possibility has been eliminated			0
the discovery was disclosed tuesday in an @entity15 news release summarizing the activities of the @entity68 , which assists in providing security on @entity71 waterways , aids in drug interdiction efforts and helps conduct underwater searches .			0
