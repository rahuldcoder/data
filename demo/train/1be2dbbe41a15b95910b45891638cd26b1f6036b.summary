-- @entity1 is offering free public @entity3 hot spots to help it deal with increasing congestion on its wireless network			1
on tuesday , the company launched a free outdoor wireless hot spot in @entity9 's @entity8			1
the pilot program will offer free @entity3 access to @entity1 wireless and broadband customers using smartphones , laptops , and other @entity3 enabled devices			1
@entity1 's @entity3 network is set up on the north side of @entity8 on @entity19 between 45th and @entity20			1
the program is designed to see how @entity3 can help relieve wireless data congestion on @entity1 's network			1
customers with @entity3 - enabled devices will connect to the @entity3 instead of @entity1 's @entity26 to access the @entity27 or web - based applications			1
if all goes well , @entity1 said it may expand the offering to other cities			1
@entity1 , the exclusive carrier in the @entity32 for the @entity33 , has been struggling to keep up with demand for data services on its network			2
the company has reported that due to new devices like the @entity33 it 's seen mobile data traffic grow on its network 5,000 percent in three years			0
the extra traffic , particularly in densely populated locales such as @entity9 and @entity43 , has caused problems for consumers in the way of dropped calls and slow net access			0
the telephone company has been investing in its network to improve capacity and network coverage			0
it 's upgraded its backhaul networks , which connect the cell sites to its internet backbone			0
it 's added new @entity58 devices that expand in - home coverage			0
and it 's bulked up coverage in sports stadiums , convention halls and other areas where people congregate			0
@entity1 has also been using its more than 20,000 @entity3 hot spots throughout the country to offload some of the traffic			1
the company has offered free @entity3 access to its smartphone subscribers in the hopes that customers will use the @entity3 network when it 's available rather than the slower 3g network			2
so far , the company has seen some success			0
in 2009 , @entity1 consumers connected to an @entity1 @entity3 hot spot four times more often than they did in 2008 , the company has said			1
and in the first quarter , @entity1 handled 53.1 million @entity3 connections on its network , which is nearly five times higher than the same quarter last year			1
one of the biggest advantages of @entity3 is that it 's already in most devices			2
laptops come with @entity3 pre-installed , and most new smartphones also come with @entity3 built in			2
it 's also faster than a 3g network , so it offers subscribers a better experience			0
advancements in the technology , especially new features found in the latest version of @entity96 , increase the range and speed of the networks			0
in urban areas , @entity3 hot spots now extend almost 2,000 feet , which is nearly as far as some cellular cell sites , according to @entity103 , ceo of fixed wireless provider @entity104			2
