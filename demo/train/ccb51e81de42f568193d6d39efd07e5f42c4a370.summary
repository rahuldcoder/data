moments before testifying at the murder trial of her son 's alleged killer wednesday , @entity1 's voice cracked when she was asked by a prosecutor to identify a photo of her son 's body			1
@entity11 judge @entity10 told @entity12 that it is " very , very important " for her to control her emotions on the witness stand once the jury returned to the @entity18 courtroom			0
the judge had to rule on what photos could be shown to the victim 's mother in the presence of the jury			1
" you are not to cry , " the judge said			0
" yes , your honor , " @entity12 replied during her brief appearance as a prosecution witness in the murder trial of former @entity29 star @entity28			1
@entity28 , 25 , pleaded not guilty in the 2013 killing of @entity33 , 27 , a former semipro football player who dated the sister of @entity28 's fiancee			1
before @entity12 took the stand , defense lawyer @entity36 objected to admitting the photo of @entity33 as evidence and showing it to the victim 's mother , saying it was " cruel and unnecessary " and aimed at eliciting emotion			1
" this woman , the mother of @entity33 , has handled herself with plenty of restraint and dignity on the stand , " prosecutor @entity43 told the judge before the jury returned			1
@entity10 allowed the photo to be shown to @entity12 but not projected on a monitor for the jury to see			0
when the jury came back , @entity12 remained composed as she testified that @entity33 was her oldest child and that he played football and basketball in high school , but did n't go to college because she could n't afford it			2
@entity12 , who had twice walked out of court sobbing when photos of her son were shown , calmly recounted that @entity33 rode his bicycle 20 miles to a landscaping job , that he played semi-pro football for the @entity65 and that she last saw him alive on @entity66 2013			1
" i just saw his beautiful pink gums smiling at me across the street , " she said			1
@entity12 then showed no emotion when she identified two photos of her son -- one of @entity33 after his death , another one of him standing in front of a neighbor 's home , wearing a cap and carrying a backpack			1
" my son , " @entity12 said after seeing the first photo			0
@entity28 looked at the second photo on the court monitor			2
that photo was shown to the jury			0
the defense did not cross-examine @entity12			0
on tuesday , a female juror was dismissed for talking about the case			0
the juror had said it would be difficult to convict the ex-player without a murder weapon and discussed inadmissible evidence , @entity10 noted			0
the judge dismissed the juror after ordering the public out of court for a hearing that included defense lawyers , prosecutors , witnesses and the juror			0
the closed - door session was " no broader than necessary to protect @entity28 's right to a fair trial , " @entity10 said			1
after the hearing , @entity10 also said there was " credible evidence " that the dismissed juror had expressed interest in being part of the @entity28 jury and had attended more @entity29 games than the juror admitted on a questionnaire			2
" the juror 's recollection of conversations is not supported by the credible evidence , " the judge said			0
the juror 's presence on the jury " posed a substantial risk " to the fairness of the trial , she said , and the dismissal was necessary in " the best interest of justice			0
" @entity126 , 23 , who was dating @entity33 at the time of his death , tuesday broke into tears when she recalled a call from a state trooper with word that " @entity33 was dead			1
" her sister , @entity133 , is @entity28 's fiancee and mother of his child			1
@entity126 testified that she later visited her sister and saw @entity28 , who placed his hand on her shoulder to console her			2
@entity28 told her " he 's been through this death thing before and it would all get better with time , " she testified			1
after @entity28 left the home , @entity126 testified , her sister @entity133 kept receiving cell phone calls and text messages			2
@entity126 said her sister seemed " secretive , " her responses " very short			0
" @entity146 would go to the basement to continue the conversations , her sister testified			0
one time , @entity126 told the jury , her sister went down to the basement with what appeared to be a new garbage bag folded in her hand			0
@entity133 later left the house , returned and asked to borrow her sister 's car , @entity126 testified			0
the case has divided the @entity126 sisters , who sit on opposite sides of the courtroom -- shaneah with @entity33 's mother and @entity133 with @entity28 's family			1
prosecutor @entity163 has told the jury that @entity28 not only orchestrated the killing , but also participated in it and covered it up			2
@entity167 summed up the prosecution 's largely circumstantial case , telling the jury that @entity28 and his associates killed @entity33 and then " took evidence with them and tried to and , in some cases , were successful in destroying evidence			1
" the three picked up @entity33 and drove to a secluded area where he was shot six times and killed , @entity163 said			2
a marijuana blunt found near @entity33 's body had traces of both his dna and that of @entity28 , @entity163 said			1
@entity28 's dna also was found on a .45 - caliber shell casing found in a car he had rented			2
a footprint at the industrial park where @entity33 's body was found matched sneakers worn by @entity28 , the prosecutor said			1
the defense said the one - time @entity192 star worth $ 40 million was targeted by police and prosecutors in the death of the semipro football player because of celebrity status			1
@entity28 " never had a chance " as authorities zeroed in , @entity36 told the jury			2
@entity10 said the jury may visit the crime scene on friday			0
two alleged accomplices , @entity203 and @entity204 , have pleaded not guilty and will be tried separately			0
@entity5 's @entity205 and @entity206 contributed to this report .			0
