-- president @entity1 delivered his @entity3 address and said -- again -- that this is the year he intends to close the detention center at @entity6			1
as president , he has promised this before , first in his inaugural address in january 2009 and then periodically reiterated over the years			0
as i write this , i am en route to the prison that @entity14 once dubbed the " @entity15			0
" one might quibble over the term , but the profile of the place is extraordinary			0
when i first went there in 2004 , i expected to find " the worst of the worst " terrorists in the world , as then - secretary of defense @entity21 had promised			0
instead , i was hard - pressed to find people who were @entity26 's enemies			2
the @entity27 has effectively conceded this -- 624 men have long since been set free , and 77 of the remaining 155 men have been cleared for release for at least four years , some for much longer			1
the majority of my clients have been cleared for release by the @entity1 administration 's 2009 @entity36 , which requires unanimous agreement by no fewer than 6 federal agencies including the @entity40 , the @entity41 , and the @entity42			1
there can be no other prison in the world where 50 percent of the inmates are told : " you are cleared to leave , but you can not go			1
" i hope to visit five of my remaining clients , although some may not come to the meeting			0
all are depressed and ( for the questionable privilege of seeing me ) had to endure for a time what the military dubbed a " scrotum search " -- an intentionally humiliating exploration of the genital area , which is intended to deter prisoners from coming to a legal visit to complain about the conditions			2
one person who will come out is @entity62 , the last @entity63 resident there			0
@entity62 does not like what he had to endure , but he told me recently that the procedure was ultimately more humiliating for the soldiers who must carry out such benighted orders			2
after all , who joined the proud @entity26 military in order to become a " @entity71 , @entity72 ? " he has been cleared since 2007 , and hopes that it will not be too long before he can return to @entity74 , finally , to meet his youngest son @entity75 , who was born on the day @entity62 arrived at @entity6 : @entity76 2002			1
the president 's broken promises have weighed heavily on all the detainees			1
as anyone can understand , it is easier to endure the certainty of abuse than to oscillate between hope and despair			0
the president is correct when he argues that @entity6 is a recruiting sergeant for extremism			1
he is right to say that @entity26 loses credibility , and inspires disdain , when we fail to adhere to our principles			0
the president is also justified when he blames the @entity93 for undermining his pledge to erase the blot of @entity6 from the reputation of this country			2
however , president @entity1 is arguably the most powerful person on the planet and his team should not promote the myth that the cleared prisoners can not be set free -- @entity62 could join his wife and four children in @entity74 tomorrow ; those of us who have worked on the issue for 12 years can help ensure the smooth repatriation of others to their own homes and families			1
equally to the point , the most powerful man on @entity111 could tell the military to stop humiliating prisoners who want to talk to their lawyers , and to end the violent and torturous practice of force - feeding those who peacefully protest their indefinite detention by hunger - striking			0
over a 30 - year career , i have visited most of the major prisons across the @entity122 , institutions that house death row or a maximum security unit , and none treats the prisoners as badly as @entity127 suffers in @entity6			1
the president could also advise me what i am meant to say next week , when my clients inevitably ask me -- as they always do -- why they are still being held despite the multiple findings that they pose no threat and can be transferred out of the hell they are living daily			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity137 .			2
