@entity0 -- it is rare for me to attend a retrospective of someone 's passion , their life 's work , while chatting to that person amid that work			1
but that 's what happened when i met the friendly and very talkative @entity14			1
he gave me 15 minutes of his time , surrounded by some 165 garments stretching throughout his 38 years as a fashion designer			1
i told his @entity22 person i needed five minutes , she told me @entity14 would chat too much to fit that window			1
" @entity24 of @entity14 ; from the @entity27 " is open now and runs through the summer at @entity0 's @entity26 center			1
i started my interview by delicately pointing out retrospectives tend to come when someone is ready to retire , to slow down			0
i was surprised he agreed			0
" of course i want you to say that			0
i feel the same , " the 61 - year - old @entity14 exclaimed with a big grin on his face			1
he stressed he still has to produce clothes for eight shows a year , but that it is time to slow down			2
from now on , @entity14 told me , he might only do one show a year			1
" it 's a lot , a lot , a lot			2
so , it 's true , i have arrived at a point where i can see the work i have done , you know			2
and i am still doing , but maybe i will restrain [ it ] a little			0
" @entity14 also surprised me by insisting he is not an artist , though he said he can be inspired by art. i would say his tartan punk , his @entity51 costumes , and his chic rabbi garment from the 1993 collection that caused outrage could very much be seen as art. exhibition curator @entity56 agreed			1
" when you see the work , some of his dresses , i think it is art , " @entity56 said			0
pointing to a leopard skin dress from the @entity64 collection of 1997 as an example , @entity56 added : " i think you can have the same emotion when you see haute couture as a sculpture or a painting			0
" @entity14 told me he did not sell any garments from his first two shows			1
then , a piece sold from his third collection in 1976			0
at that time , his focus was @entity77 and some bands would buy his clothes without his knowledge , @entity14 said			1
he 'd realize only when seeing the video			0
of course , that was not the case with the likes of @entity85 and @entity86 , who have proudly warn his creations on stage			0
and paid for them , if @entity14 is to be believed			2
he insists he never gives his clothes away to gain publicity			0
" honestly , i think i am of the generation that , you know , the people that have the money to pay should pay			0
" @entity14 says he 's no businessman , but that sounds like good business practice			1
" it was very good to have clothes that sell			2
for me the purpose was to sell , even if it looked sometime provocative , i did n't do it to show my own fantasy , some fantasy , or to show art. "			0
