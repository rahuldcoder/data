-- on average , 18 people in the @entity2 die each day waiting for an organ transplant			1
billionaire @entity5 co-founder @entity4 wants to change that			1
he announced tuesday that the social networking site wants to " help solve the crisis " by allowing users to volunteer as potential organ donors in the @entity2 and the @entity11			1
" we think that a lot of people who might just be on the fence about whether or not they want to do this , could be convinced to do that , " @entity4 told @entity12			1
he described widespread acceptance of organ donation as " a shift in society that will probably take a while to fully take hold " until more @entity5 users start sharing their experiences			1
" but i think that if people choose to share these stories with their friends , that can make a big difference over time			1
" @entity0 's @entity32 : each donor can save seven lives more than 114,000 people in the @entity2 are awaiting organ donations , 79 people on an average day receive a transplant while 18 die , according to @entity39			1
the site says more than 100 million people in the @entity2 are registered donors			1
" we could save thousands more lives a year if we had another 20 , 30 , 40 million more people registered , " said @entity42 , president and ceo of @entity44 , which is partnering with @entity5 in this effort			1
the @entity5 tool works like this : users go to their timelines , where under @entity53 they will see a health and wellness section			2
@entity4 said : " you put in , ' i decided to be an organ donor ' and your state or country you live in and you can add a story about how you decided to be an organ donor			2
" more than 10,000 people in the @entity11 need a transplant , according to the website for @entity65			2
a @entity5 user will also see a @entity68 link when a friend 's donor update hits their news feed			0
the facebook page also includes links to @entity44 for people to become official donors			0
going through an online state registry or indicating you want to be a donor when you get your driver 's license means signing a legal agreement , unlike the @entity5 pledge			0
" the @entity5 partnership is an opportunity for people to share decisions , " @entity42 said			2
" the most important part of this is actually registering to be a donor so that your wishes can be carried out			0
sharing that decision through @entity5 is an opportunity to encourage your friends and family to also register			0
" people have shared their desire to donate their organs on @entity5 before , and others have talked about their need for a transplant , but the idea is n't to match these people , @entity42 said			2
promoting social agendas has n't been a big tradition at @entity5 , although in 2011 it did pair with @entity0 's sister company , @entity105 , to rally against bullying			2
there have been several other initiatives			0
" encouraging users to share that they are organ donors is another simple and non-controversial move @entity5 can make to add value to the service beyond the traditional status updates and photo sharing , " wrote @entity109 , lead writer at the blog inside @entity5 , in an e-mail to @entity0			1
she said @entity5 has also been involved with finding places to vote in national elections , issuing @entity120 through some pages , as well as joining a group of companies to promote world peace			0
@entity125 , a spokeswoman for the @entity126 , applauded the organ donation plan			0
" it 's absolutely fabulous that so many people will learn how easy it is to sign up to be an organ , eye and tissue donor , " she said			0
@entity39 also recommends that people who want to be donors inform family members , tell their doctors and include this wish in their wills			0
@entity5 has 161 million users in the @entity2 , spokeswoman @entity140 said in an e-mail			1
she said the company did n't have solid numbers on how many people had used the organ donation tool yet			0
