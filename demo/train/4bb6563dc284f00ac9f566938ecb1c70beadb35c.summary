when @entity1 introduced a preview version of a fresh and inventive webmail service it called @entity5 last august , it was pretty clear that it was telling the world that it intended to start winding down its venerable @entity5 sooner or later			1
the company is announcing that @entity5 is coming out of preview mode and is now officially available worldwide			1
and so it 's going to start moving more than 300 million @entity5 users over			1
they 'll be able to keep their @entity5 e-mail addresses — or @entity14 or @entity15 , if that 's what they 've got — but the @entity5 service and brand will be going away			1
the transition will be gradual : at first , the @entity5 faithful will get e-mails and other alerts telling them about the switchover			0
they 'll be able to make the jump immediately , or postpone it			0
but by the end of the summer , the company intends to have moved all @entity5 users over to @entity5			1
for most of those people , that should be a good thing — or at least , as forced transitions go , not a bad thing			0
while it 's impossible to underestimate the ferocity with which some folks prefer to clutch onto whatever they 've already got , @entity5 is a far better service than @entity5 , with a radically decluttered interface and useful new organization tools			2
( i also like its interface — which is a variant of the @entity45 look formerly known as @entity46 — better than @entity47 's			0
) yet it 's also recognizable as having a family connection to @entity5 , reducing the chances that anyone will be bewildered by it or will lose a favorite feature once the switchover is complete			0
at the moment , @entity1 says , @entity5 has 60 million active members , a third of which are @entity47 users			1
( presumably some of those are true defectors from @entity47 , while others use both @entity47 and @entity5			0
) once the @entity5 transition is complete , @entity5 will have hundreds of millions of users , giving it the same sort of massive scale as @entity47 ( 425 million users as of june 2012 ) and @entity68 ( 281 million users as of december 2012 )			2
and @entity1 seems to be serious about winning over lots more users from @entity47 and other services : it 's planning to advertise @entity5 heavily in all sorts of media			1
the company has posted a couple of splashy tv spots — both of which , unlike the current @entity77 campaign , are devoted to making people feel good about @entity5 rather than bad about @entity47			0
while i 'm favorably impressed by @entity5 , i 'm not considering dumping @entity47 myself anytime soon ; @entity83 's service remains a much richer platform , with additional useful features , mobile apps and support from third - party apps and services			2
@entity1 says to expect more @entity5 features now that the service is out of preview mode , including @entity94 video calls and a calendar , both of which the company first promised when it announced the service last year			1
i 'll be keeping an eye on it — an @entity5 which retained its sleek look and competed with @entity47 in depth and breadth of capabilities could be spectacular			0
even @entity47 users who have no intention of leaving the service should be happy that @entity5 exists			2
just as @entity1 's @entity107 gives @entity83 's search engine its only serious competition , @entity5 is poised to be @entity47 's most imposing rival			2
i 'm still getting used to the notion of @entity1 , of all companies , being a plucky underdog — but i 'm glad it 's giving @entity83 at least two incentives to avoid resting on its laurels .			0
