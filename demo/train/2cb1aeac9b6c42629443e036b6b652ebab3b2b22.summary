@entity0 -- @entity3 and @entity4 agents finished searching 18 " spots of interest " in @entity10 , @entity0 on thursday without uncovering additional evidence in their investigation of a possible serial killer			1
" we did n't uncover anything that was noteworthy , " said @entity3 spokesperson @entity11			1
" most of it was debris			2
" their efforts are part of a probe into suspected serial killings that have turned up at least eight bodies -- four of them identified as prostitutes -- since december 2010			1
@entity24 troopers alongside some 30 police officers from @entity10 's @entity27 and @entity28 counties hacked their way through the area 's thick brush and bramble , using guidance from a helicopter overhead and , in some cases , using chainsaws to cut through the thick foliage			1
aviation teams that flew over parts of @entity10 had " identified a significant number of items that are n't natural for the area , " said @entity27 acting police commissioner @entity38			1
but as of thursday , authorities had not uncovered any further human remains			1
earlier this week , police discovered skeletal remains -- including a human skull -- prompting the widening search			1
police have not said whether they are from different people , or if they could have come from the eight victims found previously			1
airplanes and helicopters with high - resolution technology are being used in the search effort , @entity28 police commissioner @entity53 explained wednesday			1
" police also are using canine search units to scour the beaches and diver teams to search the waterways on the north side of the barrier island			1
but they have met obstacles			2
" canine teams have been of limited assistance , " said detective @entity67			2
" the problem with this brush is it 's so thick dogs wo n't even go in			2
" meanwhile , medical examiner investigators are trying to determine the age and sex of the victims from the remains , and how long they were at the locations before they were discovered			1
" we 're going back to some of the unidentified people in our system to try to see if we can identify them so we can notify loved ones if we have their remains , " said @entity79 , a spokeswoman for the @entity0 medical examiner 's office			1
" hopefully we 're going to get some ids and we 'll find out who these people are , and then the families will know , " she added			0
the remains found monday in a @entity27 wildlife preserve were wrapped in a " black plastic product " similar to a plastic bag , a law enforcement source said wednesday			1
the remains " appeared to be part of a lower extremity , " the source said			1
but police say the remains are not connected to the bodies of four prostitutes found near @entity103 , @entity104 , in 2006			1
" the indications we have right now is that there 's no connection between the @entity103 case and the @entity28 case , " @entity53 said			1
" there are other items connected with the two cases " that would indicate the same killer was not involved in the slayings , he said			2
@entity53 did not provide additional details , but said @entity28 police officers have been in contact with their @entity103 counterparts since the early stages of the @entity10 investigation			1
federal agents first joined police in the investigation in december after the first four bodies were found			1
that discovery on a quarter - mile stretch of @entity128 indicates that " they were dumped there by the same person or persons , " @entity53 told reporters at the time			0
" it 's too coincidental that there were four bodies in the same location			2
" they were all found stuffed in bushes along an isolated strip of waterfront property			2
the grisly find occurred as police searched for @entity144 , 24 , who was last seen alive in may 2010 in the @entity146 area			2
@entity148 's sisters said @entity144 was an escort who was visiting a client			0
they said she ran from the man 's house and called 911 , claiming that someone was trying to hurt her			0
a man who lives a few miles from where the remains were found told @entity1 that a young woman who " looked like she was partying all night " came to his door at about 5 a.m. on may 1			1
" she was screaming ' help me , help me ! ' and said somebody was chasing her , " said @entity162 , who lives in the town of @entity128			0
he described the woman as a " young , light - brown - haired person in her early 20s			0
" @entity162 said he called 911 after opening his front door to the woman , but she fled , eventually hiding under his boat , which was elevated and parked on his lawn			0
moments later , @entity162 said , an " @entity171 - looking man " man driving a dark - colored sport utility vehicle pulled up alongside his home			0
" things got out of hand at a party and i 'm just looking for her , " @entity162 quoted the man as saying			0
when @entity162 told the man that he had called police , the man said he " should n't have done that			0
" the woman then fled toward the beach and the driver pursued her , @entity162 said			0
but he told @entity1 it took police more than four months to question him about the incident , an allegation that police deny			0
@entity162 later told @entity1 that he believes the woman he saw that night was @entity148			0
@entity1 can not independently verify that claim			0
" i have no idea when the detective spoke to whomever you are talking about , " @entity53 told @entity1			0
" if you want to see somebody after this press conference we 'll certainly follow up on that			0
" police later clarified that they spoke with @entity162 on may 1 after he made the 911 call and several times since			0
pressed for the dates of the police department 's conversations with @entity162 and the length of time between them , they revealed that they obtained a statement from @entity162 in june but provided no further specifics			0
" they never got a statement from me in june , " @entity162 told @entity1			0
@entity148 's body has not been among the remains identified			2
@entity1 's @entity214 and @entity215 contributed to this report			0
