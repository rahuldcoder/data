-- when her @entity3 residency begins at the end of the month , @entity1 should probably stay away from the roulette wheel , because numbers are not her friend at the moment			2
@entity1 ' new album " @entity9 " arrived this week , moving only 107,000 copies for a fourth place finish on the @entity12			1
it 's the weakest opening week in @entity1 ' career , both by hard sales numbers and chart position ( previously , her slowest sales week was the opening frame of her debut " ... @entity21 , " which tallied 121,000 copies )			1
album review : ' @entity9 ' the numbers for " @entity9 " are also a giant drop - off from the opening week of her previous album , 2011â € ²s " @entity28 , " which sold 276,000 copies in its first week			1
it 'll be interesting to track " @entity9 " moving into 2014 , as she may get a bump from the just - released video for the single " perfume " and another once her @entity3 show gets rolling			0
@entity1 had to dive out of the way of @entity37 , whose " blame it on my roots : five @entity41 " took the no. 1 spot on the chart this week			1
in its second full week of release , the @entity43 - exclusive box set ( containing six cds , two dvds , and retailing for around $ 25 ) sold 146,000 copies			1
@entity37 is now tied for fourth place all - time for no. 1 albums with nine ( same as @entity51 and the @entity52 )			1
he trails the @entity53 ( 19 ) , @entity54 ( 13 ) , @entity55 and @entity56 ( both with 10 )			0
expect " blame it on my roots " to stay strong during the holiday season			0
@entity1 ' ' perfume ' video smells like ... feelings ! watch it here speaking of the holiday season , @entity63 releases continue to rack up big numbers			0
@entity65 's " @entity68 " had another big week , coming in at no. 3 on the chart with 112,000 copies sold			2
it 's looking more and more like @entity65 's album may end up being a perennial champ , like @entity72 's " @entity63 " ( which still does big numbers every december )			0
@entity65 is joined by four other holiday - related releases in the top 10 : " @entity75 : a @entity76 " ( no. 5 , 105,000 sold ) , @entity78 's " @entity77 " ( no. 7 , 60,000 ) , @entity79 © 's " @entity63 " ( no. 8 , 57,000 ; another perennial juggernaut ) , and @entity82 's " a @entity81 " ( no. 10 , 51,000 )			2
two non-christmas releases remain strong in the top 10			0
