numerous arrests speckle @entity10 's rap sheet , including on suspicion of theft , battery and types of deception -- fraud and impersonation -- often in connection with drug possession			2
but @entity6 spoke openly about her record to @entity1 , including her last arrest in 2008 , which led to more than three years in prison for drug trafficking and possession			2

but even then i worried about the repercussions			0

" ten years ago , the climate still was n't right , " she said			0
" we would have all been humiliated			0
now , i could see it was time , and i would be safer			0
i would n't be alone			0
it took me 38 years to feel safe			0
