president @entity0 delivered a poignant personal promise to the @entity3 people monday , vowing to continue to fight to improve racial tensions in @entity5 , given the " particular experiences " he brings to the office			1
" i 'm going to stay on this , " the president said monday in an interview with @entity10 , a network that reaches a predominately young @entity13 - @entity3 audience			1
" not only am i going to stay on it ... but hopefully the entire society says , ' let 's finally try to make some real progress on this			2
' " once criticized for shying away from the topic of race early on in his presidency , @entity0 has recently taken a more active role in sharing how his personal experiences help him to empathize with all kinds of people affected by the recent protests on racial tensions -- from protesters , to victims , to law enforcement officers , to families , and most importantly , to black youth			1
in his interview with @entity10 's " @entity36 , " the president cited a meeting he had with nonviolent protesters monday -- between ages 18 - 25			1
for him , he says , listening to young african - americans describe their own experiences of being stopped for no reason , or being unjustly labeled as suspicious , strikes a personal chord			2
" my mind went back to what it was like for me when i was 17 , 18 , 20 , " the president said			2
" as i told them , not only do i hear the pain and frustration of being subjected to that kind of constant suspicion , part of the reason i got into politics was to figure out how can i bridge some of those gaps and understandings so that the larger country understands this is not just a black problem or a brown problem , this is an @entity3 problem			0
" the president also made a point to invoke attorney general @entity62 's race and civil rights record , saying , " he 's got a similar set of stories and experiences he can share			1
" while most of the protests across the country have been relatively peaceful , many of the gatherings have caused traffic delays and street closures			0
according the president , those are small prices to pay in order to achieve the larger goal of ending racial tensions in @entity5			1
" a country 's conscience sometimes has to be triggered by some inconvenience , " the president said			0
" as long as they 're peaceful , i think they 're necessary			0
when they turn violent then they 're counter-productive			0
" as he noted in the first half of his interview , teased sunday , the clear video evidence available in the chokehold death of @entity89 , a black man , in @entity90 in july has helped the broader public come to believe there are racial inequalities in the criminal justice system in a way the shooting death of @entity97 , also black , in @entity98 , @entity99 , in august , did not			1
in both cases , grand juries failed to indict the white police officers responsible for their deaths			0
" it used to be folks would say , ' well , maybe blacks are exaggerating			0
some of these situations are n't what they describe , ' " @entity0 said			2
" what we 've now seen on television -- now for everybody to see -- gives us the opportunity to finally have the conversation , that you know , has been a long time coming			0
" the president will be interviewed by both @entity120 and @entity121 on tuesday , both of which are networks that target primarily @entity124 audiences			0
in his interview monday , @entity0 suggested that people who are n't " @entity3 " view the deaths of both @entity98 and @entity89 as " tragedies			1
