@entity0 -- @entity3 season begins thursday and @entity4 will be full of sights , sounds , smells ... and stains			1
fans love to watch the cat - and - mouse game between the pitcher and hitter or the wonderful defense dance of a 6 - 4 - 3 double play			2
still others watch the players get dirty with ground - in dirt and grass stains and wonder , " how do they get those uniforms looking so brand new for the next day ? " to answer this tough question , i went to the people who would know best : " clubbies			1
" a clubbie is the nickname for the guys who work in the clubhouses			0
they 're in charge of things like making sure the players ' gear is ready to use and that the uniforms look good for the next game			1
" the process used to be just spraying some kind of a detergent right directly onto the fabric itself and scrubbing the heck out of it and causing it to look like some kind of a fur or something , " said @entity35 , clubhouse manager for the @entity36			1
" it was very labor intensive , too			0
" i asked @entity35 whose uniform they dreaded most ? who is the dirtiest guy on the team ? " we do n't like to talk about it , but his initials are @entity58 , " laughed @entity35			1
" he 's hard to figure out			2
" " we have to put that tape that police put around dead bodies around his laundry , " he joked			0
i searched out first baseman @entity58 and found him on the way to the batting cage for a little pregame batting practice			1
i felt a little bit like a stoolie when i told him what @entity35 said about him : that he 's the dirtiest guy on the team			1
" probably , " @entity58 said proudly			1
" i got ta get dirty , you know , playing defense over there , getting on the bases			1
there are guys who give false hustle and they got false dirt , " he said			2
he explained that false hustle and false dirt happen when a player who is stretching gets a little dirt on his uniform and then acts like he got that stain from a hustle play			1
" but i 'm legit , " @entity58 said			1
so how do you get a uniform like @entity58 's clean ? first , it 's a matter of understanding baseball - specific stains			1
they are called nature stains : grass , ground - in dirt , blood and sweat			1
grass stains are probably the toughest			1
grass contains a green dye called chlorophyll			2
so , in fact , the stain from grass is actually a chlorophyll stain			2
if you combine that with ground - in dirt or red clay , which is used a lot in infields , you have one nasty stain			2
the detergents and soaps that break up the surface tension of the water are called surfactants			0
they allow the detergent to quickly penetrate the cloth			0
then the agitation of the machine helps to emulsify , or surround , the dirt so it wo n't go back into the clothes			2
much of this depends on the electrical charges in the water and the detergent			0
but if the stains do n't come completely out , you have to resort to using @entity35 's ancient pretreat , brush and flush method			1
" we did it that way for , shoot , 24 years at least , " @entity35 said			0
then , during a road trip to @entity135 about four years ago , @entity35 was talking with the clubhouse manager from the @entity137 and discovered the team used a new product , " @entity140			1
" it 's an industrial stain remover specifically made for @entity3 by @entity142 and his partner , chemist @entity143			0
the two men were in the cleaning business and heard how clubs used all different types of pretreatments and other products to get the uniforms clean			2
so they formed their own company , @entity151 , and set out to develop a better cleaning product			0
@entity35 said what they came up with , slide out , is to him a miracle product			0
" it 's a two - part process " @entity35 said			0
" slide out one -- a real dark purplish - brown liquid that goes on and it permeates into your fabric			0
and when you do it you think you 're crazy because there is no way this is going to come out because i just made a big mess , " he said			0
" then there 's @entity169 , which is a clear liquid that when it goes right onto the fabric and the chemical it turns it pretty much white			0
it takes all the dirt , all the soil , all the metals that are in there and just pulls it right out			0
" best would not say what the secret ingredient might be , if there is one , but he did say the product would be available for consumers soon			0
so , mom and dad can look forward to having their kids ' uniforms looking major - league clean every game .			0
