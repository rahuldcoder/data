@entity9 , @entity1 weighing in on last week 's terror in @entity4 and the debate over freedom of expression it stirred , @entity0 said en route to the @entity1 that killing " in the name of @entity12 " is wrong , but it is also wrong to " provoke " people by belittling their religion			1
the @entity0 stressed that there was no justification for the killing of 17 people in three separate incidents , including a massacre in and around the offices of satirical magazine @entity22			1
the assailants were reportedly @entity24 extremists , some of whom called out " @entity28 , " which is arabic for " @entity12 is great , " as they singled out the magazine , @entity4 authorities and @entity31 people			1
" one can not make war ( or ) kill in the name of one 's own religion , " @entity0 said on his way to the @entity1			1
" ... to kill in the name of @entity12 is an aberration			1
" still , even as he decried the violence and generally spoke in support of freedom of expression , the pontiff said that such freedom must have its limits			2
he did n't mention @entity22 specifically , or its cartoon depictions of @entity46 , something that many @entity48 find offensive			0
a previous cartoon was one reason the @entity52 magazine was targeted , and it did n't back down afterward , with its post-attack cover showing @entity46 again , this time crying and holding a sign with the rallying cry " @entity56 , " @entity4 for " i am @entity56			0
" still , even without talking about the magazine by name , the @entity0 prefaced his remarks by saying , " let 's go to @entity52 , let 's speak clearly			1
" he then referred to recent violence there , as well as the debate about freedom of expression			2
@entity0 said on his flight from @entity67 , @entity68 , to @entity9 that everyone had not only the liberty , but also the obligation , " to say what he thinks to help the common good			1
" but he added that this should be done without giving offense , because human dignity should be respected			0
if a friend " says a swear word against my mother , then a punch awaits him , " @entity0 said			1
@entity83 reported that he then " gestured with a pretend punch " directed at the friend , @entity85 -- an action that many journalists interpreted as a joke			2
@entity83 spokesman @entity89 later told @entity2 the remark was " spoken colloquially , " adding the @entity0 was n't advocating violence or in any way justifying the terror attacks			1
right after the punch gesture , @entity0 said , " it 's normal , it 's normal			1
" one can not provoke , one can not insult other people 's faith , one can not make fun of faith			1
" later , @entity0 arrived in the @entity1 , @entity102 's most @entity101 nation and one hungry for his arrival			1
everything from the country 's supreme court to backstreet businesses have closed down , but the streets have come alive			2
people have been pouring into the capital from all over the country to greet the head of the @entity113 as he starts his five - day visit			1
on street corners , in malls , on public transport , it 's impossible not to feel the presence of the @entity0			1
giant billboards with an official red and blue " @entity122 logo " adorn many of @entity9 's buildings , while curbside vendors sell images of his smiling face on everything from stamps and towels to fans and key chains			1
@entity1 have been granted a national holiday for the visit , the coast guard has declared a no - sail zone within a mile of @entity137 , many of the capital 's main roads will be closed , and @entity9 's airport has limited its operations			1
an estimated 40,000 security personnel will be deployed to keep the @entity0 safe during his time in @entity9 and @entity145 , where he will celebrate @entity146 in @entity147 , a city still coming to terms with the devastation caused by @entity150 a year ago			1
pope @entity0 ' visit is being billed as one of " mercy and compassion			1
" but in a country where a conservative church has fought strongly against legislation allowing government distribution of birth control , as well as the legalization of divorce , some @entity1 hope this pontiff 's more open - minded approach might lead to change			1

" he 's approachable , listens and answers questions , explains and does not ignore questions that are controversial , " he said			0
@entity176 , also 24 , agreed			0
" since he is not so black - and - white , it makes us think , ' i want to hear more of what he has to say about this , ' " she said			1
indeed , for many people in the @entity1 , having a head of church with these qualities is welcome			0
@entity185 , 25 , was asked to leave his home when he came out as gay to his " deeply religious " parents			0
he said he still prays , goes to church and receives sacraments but has been driven away by what he calls irony in the church 's teachings			0
" the church says it 's ok to be gay as long as you do n't engage in homosexual acts			0
but if you say you accept us for being gay , then why are you stopping us from acting gay ? we are not plants that photosynthesize			0
we need love and affection , too			0
" @entity185 , who went to catholic schools for most of his life , told @entity2 , " i no longer join @entity101 community groups			0
i practice what i know and believe instead of what they are telling me to believe			0
" one woman , who described herself as a " modern " @entity101 but preferred to remain anonymous , said the @entity83 hierarchy needs to be revamped			0
" the @entity0 is introducing changes that the ancient church needs to keep in step with the 21st century			2
there are too many antiquated , irrelevant rules that turn off the youth			0
this @entity0 is a breath of fresh air			2
" the church 's staunch position on artificial birth control -- that it 's a sin and will relax moral standards -- is an example			2
" a woman should have the right to decide what form to use to prevent unwanted pregnancies , " she added			0
" birth control is not abortion ! " @entity185 says he feels the church in the @entity1 is less tolerant than the @entity0 and hopes its clergy will become more moderate after his visit			1
" a priest near my home says in each homily that gay people are condemned to damnation , " he said			0
" i hope the @entity0 can shed some humility to people like him			2
the church here is too rooted in their causes , whereas the @entity0 is more accepting			2
" one of the most divisive issues in the @entity1 in recent years is a controversial bill that addresses birth control			0
the @entity248 , which allows the government to distribute and educate the public about artificial birth control , finally passed last year after a 14 - year battle , but the fight with the church and more conservative elements in the @entity1 over its implementation continues today			0

" of course we have problems , but introducing these things will not solve them			0
it 's better to educate people in virtues like chastity or fortitude -- learning to face difficulties without giving up easily			2
" although media have widely reported the @entity0 making what could be considered more liberal comments about controversial issues such as birth control , homosexuality and divorce -- which is illegal here -- he has not actually made any changes to church policy			1
father @entity285 , a prominent @entity1 theologian , says @entity0 has just started changing how he handles his people			2
" he just said that you should openly discuss these things ; let everybody have the chance to talk			0
but then , when the discussion is over , he and his advisers will make a decision , but the decisions have not been made			0
" catholics like @entity176 hope that the @entity0 's progressive approach may one day lead to the right to divorce			1
but @entity300 , bishop emeritus of @entity301 , says divorce -- which critics say will ruin the family , a cornerstone of @entity1 life and faith -- is something that will never be allowed			2

i am sure he will never agree to gay marriage either , " he said			0
@entity176 says he believes it 's about trust and being open to different interpretations			0
" do n't you trust your people enough to give them a choice ? if i was solid in my faith and did n't believe in divorce , then i would not do it , " she said			0
" you ca n't define a family from the dictionary			0
does that mean if you grew up with just a father that it 's not family ? that you were not taken care of , or protected or loved ? " cardinal @entity340 : pope @entity0 says @entity1 visit ' not about him ' @entity2 's @entity342 wrote from @entity343 , and @entity344 reported from the @entity1			1
@entity2 's @entity345 and @entity346 contributed to this report .			0
