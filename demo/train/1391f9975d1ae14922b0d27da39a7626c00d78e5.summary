@entity0 -- a @entity3 estimate that @entity4 is home to nearly a trillion dollars in sought - after minerals is good news , but it provides no assurance that the nation is on its way to peace and productivity , says analyst @entity12			1
@entity12 told @entity1 he is skeptical of the idea that you could " divide $ 1 trillion by the population of @entity4 to reach the conclusion that every @entity4 will be rich ... the history of natural resources and mineral wealth is that it produces enormous corruption and mismanagement , and very often the money does not go down to the average person			1
" @entity25 geologists reported monday that @entity4 has large supplies of iron , copper and gold , along with other valuable minerals but cautioned that quick riches were not in store			1
" turning the potential of @entity4 's mineral wealth into actual revenue will take years , " said @entity34 spokesman @entity33			1
@entity12 said , " it can be made more effective			1
@entity40 has lots of natural resources , @entity39 has lots of natural resources , but you really have to create an honest and efficient government , which gets us back to the central problem in @entity4			1
" the author and host of @entity1 's " @entity51 " spoke to @entity1 on wednesday			0
here is an edited transcript : @entity1 : the @entity54 reported this week that @entity3 geologists had discovered what amounts to a potential trillion - dollar lode of minerals in @entity4 ? what 's the significance of that finding ? @entity12 : well i think it 's great work on the part of the @entity3			1
i know the assistant secretary of defense , @entity66 , has been working on this			0
he 's done some amazing work in @entity69 in getting their economy started			0
i think that it 's very important to find some viable economic model for @entity4			1
i have to say , however , that finding the minerals is the easy part			2
creating a real economy that distributes the wealth that this produces in an effective and efficient and honest way is the much , much larger challenge			0
think about the countries around the world that have great mineral wealth -- @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86			0
these are not places where the average person is doing well			0
@entity84 is the sixth - largest oil exporter in the world and its per capita gdp [ @entity93 ] is abysmal			0
@entity1 : the government in the hands of @entity96 has been criticized for not being transparent and for not tackling corruption			1
has there been any progress on that ? @entity12 : i think there has been some progress			1
@entity96 has been willing to speak out and act in ways that he has n't before			1
his attorney general has brought charges and prosecuted people			0
clearly not enough -- the government is riddled with corruption at every level -- but there is some movement			0
but i would say the first great challenge that @entity96 faces is to make his government seem legitimate in the eyes of the people			1
and some part of that is about the government not being seen as corrupt , but some part of it is also about him creating a broad - based coalition -- and that means making sure that he 's not excluding from government , from patronage , from local councils , those people who have credibility and political support in their areas			1
the key to this government 's success or failure is if the @entity138 community -- which makes up 50 percent of @entity4 and 100 percent of the insurgency -- sees the government of @entity96 as their government as opposed to an alien force			1
that 's where the bulk of the work has to take place			0
for more on the region , read the " @entity150 " blog @entity1 : it 's been reported that @entity96 does n't believe that the war against the @entity152 can be won on the battlefield ? @entity12 : i think that 's a fair statement , and i think he 's right			1
if the @entity152 is to some extent an expression of @entity138 resistance to this government ... this is not an alien force coming from outside that you can defeat and they will go home to @entity166 or wherever it is			1
most of them , the vast majority , are @entity4 , so you 're going to have to live with them			2
and that means while of course you have to defeat militarily the most radical , the most intransigent elements of the @entity152 , you also have to make deals to include some of them , particularly in mid- and low levels in some kind of new consensual framework			1
so if what @entity96 means is you 're going to have to share power with some @entity138 who have been identified with the @entity152 , i think he 's absolutely right			1
if you look at the end of civil wars , they almost always end in some form of negotiation			0
there 's very rarely complete annihilation or outright defeat of the opponent			0
unlike wars between two states , in a civil war the people you 're fighting are people you 're going to have to live with the next day			0
the @entity25 should not be allergic to the idea of political solutions to @entity4 , because that is the only viable way we are going to get peace and stability			1
@entity1 : is it your sense that there is conflict on this issue between @entity96 and the @entity25 ? @entity12 : well the @entity25 was opposed for a long time to the idea of any kind of deal making with the @entity152			1
through most of the @entity210 administration , the was regarded as completely impermissible			0
... i think there has been a change in recent months , and it should be encouraged			0
@entity1 : so you think the @entity217 administration is not wary of making concessions to the @entity152 ? @entity12 : well , it does n't seem to have same allergy to negotiations , but they 're not moving wholeheartedly on that front			1
for example , the crucial issue for many members of the @entity152 is that they be taken off the @entity228 blacklist , where they 're described as terrorists			2
their view is that this is a national resistance movement			0
they 're not @entity234 , and they were never part of @entity234 , and we have been very reluctant to take them off the blacklist			0
we should be looking at that list very carefully , trying to figure out if there are people there we do want to try to negotiate with			0
if you do want to negotiate with them , one great prize you can offer them is to take them off the @entity228 list			0
so we 've got to remember that there are real concerns that these people have about their own physical safety and security that need to be addressed			0
if we want to see them take some significant moves , we will have to take some significant moves as well and taking them off the @entity228 blacklist is probably the most important			0
@entity1 : is that the major obstacle to political stability in @entity4 right now ? @entity12 : the ultimate obstacle to stability is that @entity262 remains a safe haven for some of the most violent and extremist groups in @entity4 , including the @entity4 @entity152 and other terrorist organizations			1
... what is worrying is the fact that there is renewed activity from these groups , and the working together of various terrorist groups			0
there are new reports that @entity275 , which is the @entity262 terrorist organization that has operated mainly against @entity276 and was implicated in the @entity278 terror attacks , is now operating against @entity4 and is responsible for some of the terrorist attacks there			2
... there 's a report out from the @entity284 this week that finds that there continue to be strong ties between the @entity262 military and these terrorist groups			0
that problem of the @entity262 connection remains at the heart of the @entity4 situation			2
it 's very difficult to see how you can have a stable @entity4 when you have safe havens in the neighboring country and the possible complicity of the military in that country			2
the @entity262 military still believes at some level that maintaining ties to these militants is what gives them leverage in @entity4			2
@entity1 : as you say , the @entity152 would argue that they should n't be on the @entity228 blacklist because they 're a national resistance movement , but are they sheltering @entity234 ? @entity12 : those elements that are sheltering @entity234 should not be taken off the blacklist			1
but all the evidence i 've seen suggests that what remains of @entity234 is entirely in @entity262 at this point and is being sheltered by groups in @entity262 , not in @entity4			2
... there 's a lot of the insurgency that 's a local @entity4 insurgency			2
those are the people we should be trying to get to switch sides , not the ones who have deep connections with the radical groups in @entity262 or certainly not with @entity234			0
the key to the victory in @entity69 was that you won over people in the middle , and you isolated the very extreme parts of the insurgency			2
we should making somewhat similar efforts in @entity4 .			2

@entity3 estimates @entity4 has nearly a trillion dollars worth of minerals
@entity12 says such wealth often does not *trickle* down to most people
he says key to success is a political *settlement* that legitimizes @entity4 government
@entity12 : @entity25 , @entity96 should *woo* away moderate elements of @entity152
