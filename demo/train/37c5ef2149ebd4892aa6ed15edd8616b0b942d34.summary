-- it 's the gaming industry 's gold standard , once named by @entity3 as the most influential video game in history			2
now , @entity6 is turning to " @entity7 " once again , hoping the beloved , 22 - year - old franchise can save sales of its faltering @entity11 console			1
" @entity13 " was released on friday			1
it comes at a time when once dominant @entity6 has already slashed its sales forecast for the @entity11 down to just 3.6 million for the current fiscal year			1
by comparison , sales of @entity20 's @entity19 console , released nearly a year after the @entity11 , have already eclipsed the @entity6 's total @entity11 sales since its 2012 launch			1
among the 5 million @entity11 titles sold this fiscal year , " @entity28 " and " @entity29 " have been among the most popular , and a new " @entity27 " title , featuring @entity13 alongside other classic video game characters , is due later this year			1
but " @entity13 " might be the @entity32 company 's best chance for the popular plumber to help the slow - selling console regain its footing			2
@entity6 reported the game sold 1.2 million units across @entity32 , @entity39 and the @entity40 during its first weekend			0
the game 's release in the @entity43 corresponded with a 666 % increase in wii u sales there , according to a @entity43 retail tracking company			2
nearly 82 % of the consoles sold in the @entity43 during that time were part of a bundle deal that included " @entity13			2
" no exact figures were available in the report , from the @entity54			0
but it was reportedly the best week of sales yet for a @entity11 title and " @entity13 " was the nation 's second - best selling title behind highly anticipated " @entity60 , " which is available for @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity19 , @entity63 and @entity64 ( a wii u version is coming later this year )			1
" the early response to @entity13 demonstrates that the best days for @entity11 are still ahead , " said @entity6 president and coo @entity67 in a press release			1
@entity13 has always been a boon for the console it was released on since " @entity7 " hit for the @entity73 ( @entity73 ) 22 years ago			2
" @entity77 " sold more than 35 million copies since its release in 2008			0
that 's more than the total number of @entity11 games sold , according to numbers released by @entity6			1
long - time fans are always looking forward to a " @entity84 " game when they get their new device and " @entity13 " is no exception			0
" @entity6 's developers are always looking for new and interesting elements to bring to a franchise , " said @entity87 , director of public relations for @entity6			1
" it 's a delicate balance to preserve the feel and integrity of a beloved franchise like ' @entity13 ' while also making it fresh for longtime players			0
" since the new title will remain a @entity11 exclusive , @entity6 hopes that well - established fan love will push gamers off the fence and get them to buy the new console			2
@entity87 did n't directly answer a question about whether " @entity13 " will boost sales over the long haul , but he sounded upbeat			0
" there 's no doubt that ' @entity13 ' is one of @entity6 's most enduring franchises , and we 're grateful it has been well - received by fans , " he said			1
" as always , it 'll be up to fans to decide whether this installment lives up to its pedigree			0
based on initial reviews and fan reactions , we 're very encouraged			0
" " @entity13 " has drawn mostly positive critical reviews from nearly all corners of the gaming press			0
gameplay features were designed to deliver a fan experience that is new , yet true to what players love about the franchise			0
they include " anti-gravity " racing , new weapons ( including a @entity128 that finally can deflect the franchise 's dreaded blue @entity129 ) , and a high - definition look			0
the game also includes new racers , karts and courses never seen in previous @entity13 games , @entity87 said			0
but it could be an uphill struggle			0
in a pre-release analysis , gaming site @entity139 predicted " @entity13 " will be the worst selling title in the franchise 's history because of the relatively small number of @entity11 consoles sold			1
if all 6.2 million or so @entity11 owners bought a copy , it would still be the second - worst selling title			0
the site projected " @entity13 " will sell fewer than 2 million units by next spring , based on past sales vs. the number of consoles that existed for each of those games			2
of course , @entity139 acknowledges , if the game does indeed spur new console purchases , that number could trend upward -- though probably not enough to match the blockbuster sales of previous " @entity84 " titles			0
at least publicly , @entity6 remains bullish on its games - first policy and thinks " @entity13 " is a big part of it			1
" @entity6 is preparing for a very strong first - party software line - up that people really want to try out , " @entity6 president @entity165 told @entity0 last june when the company let people try out six new @entity11 titles including " @entity13			1
" " by selling the software , we 'd like to expand the hardware sales of the @entity11 system			1

" @entity13 8 , " the latest in the popular series , was released friday
it comes as @entity6 's @entity11 suffers from *lackluster* sales
@entity6 is hoping the software will help sell hardware
early signs are good -- @entity11 sales are up big in the @entity43
