@entity0 -- the soldier that @entity3 claimed @entity6 militants captured friday , as a temporary cease - fire to the conflict in @entity0 rapidly unraveled , is dead , @entity3 's military said			1
" lieutenant @entity10 ... was killed in battle in the @entity12 on friday , august 1 , " the @entity9 announced early sunday			2
it 's not clear whether @entity10 , 23 , was captured as the @entity9 had previously said , or whether he died alongside two other soldiers in an armed clash in @entity0			1
military spokesman @entity16 said @entity10 was promoted to lieutenant posthumously			1
speculation about his fate was already up in the air after the armed wing of @entity6 , the @entity21 , announced it had lost contact with a group of its fighters in the @entity27 area -- the same area where @entity10 was reportedly taken			1
in a statement posted on its website , the militant group says it assumes all the fighters died in an @entity3 airstrike , including possibly an @entity3 soldier			1
the group -- which denied having info on @entity10 -- stopped short of saying the soldier was captured , using the phrasing " assuming he was captured by the fighters			1
" whatever happened , the entire ordeal has only served to heighten the hostilities -- with @entity3 claiming it must attack @entity0 in order to prevent the onslaught of rocket attacks on its territory , while @entity6 and other @entity47 assert @entity3 is the aggressor and directly responsible for hundreds of civilian deaths			1
and the bloodshed shows no signs of letting up			0
@entity3 prime minister @entity52 vowed saturday to " continue to act in full scale " against @entity6 until all militant tunnels are destroyed			1
he told reporters in @entity56 that @entity3 troops have " managed to hurt severely " the capability of @entity6 during the @entity0 operation			1
but they 're not done			0
" in the beginning of the operation we promised to bring back calm and order ( to @entity3 ) , and we will continue to operate until this goal is reached no matter how much time or force it takes , " @entity52 said			2
the prime minister said that after the tunnels are destroyed , @entity3 forces will " regroup , " depending on their security needs			2
@entity70 a senior @entity6 leader and a member of its political bureau , told @entity1 that @entity52 's statement was " an admission of failure , defeat and confusion			1
" " the @entity47 resistance will continue to stand up to this @entity81 aggression and defend our people until this aggression stops and the siege ends and the just goals of our people are achieved , " he said			0
barbs and accusations fly each side continued to blame the other for the collapse of an attempted cease - fire friday , which disintegrated before it ever really took hold			1
@entity3 has blamed @entity6 for going after its soldiers , including @entity10 , soon after the cease - fire was to begin			1
since then , the @entity9 has resumed shelling -- including hitting 200 " terror targets " in @entity0 in the past 24 hours , including " tunnels , weapon manufacturing and storage facilities , and command and control centers			0
" a huge predawn blast rocked @entity0 as the @entity104 was apparently hit by @entity3 shelling			2
according to the @entity9 , it was targeting " a @entity6 military wing facility " involved in weapons development within the building			2
in addition , @entity3 aircraft targeted a missile launcher used to fire at @entity56 early saturday , the @entity9 said			1
@entity6 leader @entity113 told @entity1 's @entity114 that @entity3 thwarted the temporary peace by staying in @entity0 and destroying tunnels there			1
" a truce is a truce , but the presence of the @entity3 forces inside @entity0 and destroying the tunnels means it 's an aggression , " he said in an exclusive interview from @entity118 , @entity119			1
" the @entity47 resistance has the right to self - defense and the right to deal with the invading @entity3 forces who are inside our @entity0 territories			1
" talking about the @entity3 , @entity113 said , " what were they doing during the truce ? they were destroying tens of houses , justifying their actions that they were looking for tunnels			2
what kind of cease - fire is this , it has no meaning this way			1
" the @entity47 death toll saturday stood at at least 1,712 , with more than 9,000 wounded , said dr. @entity143 , spokesman for the @entity144 in @entity0 , via @entity145			0
the dead included 398 children , 207 women and 74 elderly people			0
in a statement , @entity47 officials warned of a public health disaster because of the lack of water , sanitation and primary health care			0
the health ministry said 10,000 homes have been destroyed in the @entity3 operation , displacing 450,000 people			2
shelters were overcrowded and unsanitary			0
cases of viral meningitis have jumped from five to 53 per day , the ministry says			0
and shelling and aerial attacks prevented authorities from retrieving decomposing bodies , which pose a significant health threat			0
@entity170 , a father of eight in the southern @entity0 city of @entity173 , described the bombing there as relentless			0
he reported fire and smoke about 10 miles away in @entity27			2
his family has had no electricity for at least 36 hours and is relying on a generator for power , he said			0
" when it runs out ... we will have to see what happens , " he said			0
" we use gas to cook			0
when we run out of gas , we will really be in trouble			0
" what is @entity6 ' endgame in @entity0 ? what is @entity3 's endgame in @entity0 ? peace efforts out of @entity192 as the conflict continued , @entity194 president @entity193 touted an @entity194 cease - fire initiative as a " real chance " to stop the bloodshed and the best way to get help into @entity0 and launch talks			1
an @entity194 proposal put forward last month was accepted by @entity3 but rejected by @entity6			1
an official @entity47 delegation arrived in @entity192 on saturday to attend the negotiations , the official news agency @entity203 reported			0
the delegation included a representative of @entity208 and @entity47 intelligence , with @entity6 and @entity211 representatives set to arrive later , the report said			2
" we 're hoping that they will be able to negotiate not just an end to this latest tragic bloodshed and to save lives and end this carnage , but also to try to dismantle all the causes that have brought about such a horrific situation , " @entity212 , executive committee member of the @entity213 in the @entity214 , told @entity1 's " @entity223			2
but , according to @entity3 media reports , @entity3 will not send a delegation to @entity192			2
the divisions between the two were on display as far away as @entity228 , where thousands of @entity230 demonstrators rallied outside of the @entity231 , calling for an end to @entity234 aid to @entity3			1
" palestinians are humans , too			0
we bleed all the same , " said @entity236 , an @entity234 of @entity47 descent			0
" the innocent civilians , all they want is peace			0
they just want some hope			0
we need to give them something			0
" tensions flared when a small group of @entity248 protesters gathered on the margins of the @entity230 rally			1
both groups shouted slogans and , in a handful of cases , some strong words , at each other			0
inside a @entity6 tunnel opinion : @entity0 peace struggle drains me of hope what you need to know about the @entity3 - @entity6 blame game @entity1 's @entity265 , @entity266 , @entity267 , @entity268 , @entity269 , @entity270 , @entity271 , @entity272 and @entity273 contributed to this report			1
