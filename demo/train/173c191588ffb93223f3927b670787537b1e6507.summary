-- a recent commentary by @entity2 in @entity0 's opinion section grossly mischaracterized the cruise industry 's practices and record , claiming that the industry is " largely unregulated " and " largely accountable to countries like @entity9 or the @entity10			1
" nothing could be further from the truth			0
essentially every aspect of the cruise industry is heavily regulated and monitored under national and international maritime laws for many purposes , the most important of which is to protect the safety of passengers and crew			1
a @entity22 agency -- the @entity21 -- mandates global standards for the safe operation of cruise ships through its 170 - member governments , including the @entity27			1
these regulations are extensive and wide - ranging			0
they start with the design and construction of the ship and extend to the operation of the vessel , the emergency equipment on board , and scenarios for emergency situations , including the evacuation of a ship			0
regulation of the cruise industry involves many levels of enforcement -- the international ; the flag state or the flag of the country that the ship is registered in ; and the port state ( the country a ship is visiting			1
) for example , cruise ships that operate from @entity27 ports are subject to strict @entity27 oversight and enforcement of international laws and regulations as well as all applicable federal laws of the @entity27			1
this oversight enforcement is carried out primarily by the @entity61			2
opinion : what cruise lines do n't want you to know most significantly , this means that any ship entering a @entity27 port , no matter what country 's flag it sails under , is subject to @entity61 examination for compliance with international and applicable @entity27 regulatory standards , especially those related to safety			1
the coast safety regulation enforcement of the @entity61 begins at the concept or design stage for new cruise ships and continues throughout the ship 's entire time of service			1
at any time , the responsible @entity61 captain of a port can prevent any cruise ship from departing if a serious violation of any regulation is found or any dangerous condition exists			2
contrary to what the op - ed 's author says , significant fires on board ships are rare			1
the global cruise industry has robust regulatory measures to protect passengers and crew			1
fire safety regulations are continuously enhanced and have reduced the frequency and severity of fires			0
the last major overhaul of fire safety regulations entered into force in 2010 , and those regulations remain the subject of continuous review and updating			0
every oceangoing ship in the @entity107 fleet must carry firefighting teams made up of crew members			0
they receive formal firefighting training and regular drills to ensure a rapid response in the unlikely event of a fire			0
the average oceangoing cruise ship has about 4,000 smoke detectors , 500 fire extinguishers , 16 miles of sprinkler piping , 5,000 sprinkler heads and six miles of fire hose			0
opinion : my celebration trip on the @entity125 jobs in the cruise industry are highly sought after , and crew members have opportunities for career advancement			1
the industry offers opportunities not available for many crew members in their home countries , allowing them to support families , pay for college and even start their own businesses			0
beyond wages , crew members are provided free room and board in a clean , well - maintained environment			0
they receive cruise - line sponsored medical care at no cost			2
and the cruise industry maintains strict workplace standards set by the @entity21 and the @entity147 -- both @entity22 agencies			1
the cruise industry also takes steps to prevent its people from bringing norovirus , which causes gastrointestinal illness , on board			1
about 10.3 million passengers embarked on @entity156 ships from a @entity27 port in 2012			2
there were 16 cases of cruise ship norovirus outbreaks reported to the @entity161 last year , involving about 2,600 passengers out of those 10.3 million			0
to put this in perspective , the @entity161 reports norovirus causes about 20 million cases of gastroenteritis a year			0
opinion : how @entity125 can clean up the pr mess the cruise industry is subject to strict international regulation and oversight and fully promotes policies and practices that foster a safe , secure and healthy cruise ship environment			2
there 's no doubt that cruising is one of the safest , affordable and enjoyable vacation experiences available today , which explains why a record 20.6 million passengers worldwide enjoyed a cruise vacation in 2011			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity185 .			2

@entity185 objects to op - ed that *criticized* cruise industry
he says the industry is heavily regulated and monitored under maritime laws
cruise ships entering @entity27 ports must be examined by @entity61 , he says
despite *headlines* and *criticism* , fires and illnesses are rare on ships , @entity185 says
