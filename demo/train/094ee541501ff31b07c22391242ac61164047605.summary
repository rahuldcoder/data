-- the age rating for new mobile video - sharing app vine has been raised to 17 + , meaning appropriate for users 17 and older , after it was flooded with pornographic images			1
since its launch two weeks ago , the @entity6 - owned @entity5 had been rated 12 + in @entity9 's @entity8 , the only place it is currently available			1
but sexually explicit video clips almost immediately began appearing within the app , including one mistakenly showcased in its " @entity14 " section , drawing outrage from some users			1
the new rating , for such criteria as " frequent / intense sexual content or nudity , " means users wishing to download @entity5 must click on a window promising that they are over 17			2
there is no age - verification system , however , and nothing to stop younger users from downloading the app. the changes are part of an update to @entity5 , announced wednesday , that also allow users to block or report a profile they find offensive			0
does @entity6 's @entity5 have a porn problem ? @entity6 had already taken steps last week to restrict how users can share sexually explicit clips			1
hashtags for such search terms as " porn , " " nude , " " sex " and " naked " no longer delivered any results			0
the issue made headlines january 28 when @entity5 users noticed a video of what was described as hardcore pornography showcased in the prominent editor 's @entity14 section of the mobile app. @entity6 pulled the clip and apologized , saying it was a mistake			2
@entity52 , the popular blogging platform that includes some porn among its roughly 92 million blogs , soon afterwards reclassified itself with the 17 + tag			0
apps are typically submitted to @entity9 with a suggested age rating , although @entity9 can request that the rating be changed			0
in the @entity8 , 17 + is the most restrictive rating			2
app stores : gatekeepers , or censors of the mobile web ?			0
