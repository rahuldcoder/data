-- drone technology is spreading rapidly			1
as many as 50 countries are developing or purchasing these systems , including @entity4 , @entity5 , @entity6 , @entity7 , and @entity8			1
even non-state actors are involved			0
@entity10 reportedly has deployed an @entity8 - designed drone			1
@entity8 is developing a new drone aircraft with a range of more than 600 miles			1
these systems are used mostly for surveillance , but it is not difficult to equip the aircraft with missiles and bombs			0
recently in @entity21 , a man was arrested for plotting to place explosives on a drone aircraft and fly it into the @entity25 or the @entity27 building			1
private contractors are getting into the business as well			0
we now have companies offering drones - for - hire			1
what kind of a future are we creating for our children ? we face the prospect of a world in which every nation will have drone warfare capability , in which terror can rain down from the sky at any moment without warning			1
military planners are developing technologies for autonomous drones , aircraft that are supposedly " intelligent " and can make their own decisions on when to unleash lethal force			1
will we give machines the power to kill people ? the development of drone weapons raises profound moral questions about the future of war			1
@entity59 officials are fond of drone weapons because they are inexpensive and seem to make the waging of war less costly			2
they allow leaders to conduct military operations without risking the lives of @entity59 soldiers or drawing public disapproval			2
they give the false impression that war can be waged with fewer costs and risks			1
any development that makes war appear to be easier or cheaper is dangerous and morally troubling			0
it lowers the political threshold of war			0
it threatens to weaken the moral presumption against the use of armed force			0
the use of drone aircraft perpetuates the illusion that military force is an effective means of countering terrorism and resolving political differences			1
we should know better by now			0
after 10 years of combat in @entity93 the threat of terrorist attack and insurgent violence remains as great as ever			0
may 2011 was the deadliest month for @entity93 civilians since the @entity97 began keeping records in 2007 , the agency 's @entity94 in @entity93 reported			2
june 's death toll was almost as high			0
terrorism is essentially a political phenomenon			0
it can not be defeated by military means			2
the @entity105 's 2008 report " how @entity106 " shows that the most effective tools against violent extremism are political processes and police operations			0
the @entity59 government claims that drone strikes are an effective tool against @entity115 leaders , but most of those being killed are low - level militants			2
many important legal questions have been raised about drone strikes			2
the @entity59 government arguably has legal authority to conduct military operations in @entity93 , based on the original congressional authorization adopted after 9/11			2
it is questionable , however , whether this authority extends to @entity7 , a country that is supposedly an ally of the @entity59			1
nor do we have legal authority to launch military strikes in @entity130 , @entity131 and other countries where the @entity59 is not officially engaged in armed hostilities			2
@entity134 may be used by soldiers against combatants in legally authorized armed conflicts , but this right does not extend to civilians			0
the @entity59 covert counterterrorism drone campaign is managed and operated by the @entity141 , an agency notorious for its past policy failures and violations of the law			0
those who are conducting these raids operate in secret beyond the restraints of military discipline and are not subject to the @entity150			0
drone weapons are very precise , but they do not eliminate the problem of civilian casualties			1
@entity155 counterterrorism adviser @entity154 claimed in june that no civilians have been killed in @entity7 in the last year because of drone strikes			1
the @entity155 quickly backed away from that outlandish claim , but administration officials continue to insist that so - called collateral damage is very low			0
@entity162 information about civilian casualties is impossible to obtain , but a new report from the @entity165 in the @entity166 sheds important light on the subject			0
their figures show that civilian casualties occur in about one fifth of @entity59 drone attacks in @entity7			1
since the drone war began in @entity7 in 2004 , more than 2,000 people have been killed in these strikes , with as few as 386 and as many as 775 civilians among the dead , including as many as 170 children			1
drone weapons raise many troubling security , legal and moral questions			0
rather than pushing ahead to develop more of these systems , our government should pause to consider the consequences of this new revolution in military technology			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity190 .			1
