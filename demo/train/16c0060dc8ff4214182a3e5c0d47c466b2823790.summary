-- for a woman whose country is on the brink of financial collapse , @entity2 teacher @entity1 is surprisingly cheerful			2
" you only hear bad things about @entity9 and @entity10 but people there still have hope , " she said			2
" they are still falling in love , going on vacation , they are getting on with their lives			0
" @entity19 is quick to add , however , that many of her friends and family are inquiring about @entity24 , where three weeks ago she started a new job teaching @entity2 at a private school in the city of @entity28			1
@entity19 is in @entity24 as part of an initiative by the education ministry in her country to teach the @entity2 language to expats living abroad			1
however , the program has been drastically reduced as @entity10 tries to cut back on spending			2
over 2,000 teachers were sent overseas in 2009 , and last year the number was cut down to 1,430			0
the teachers pay for their own travel and relocation but continue to receive a salary from the @entity2 government			1
teachers ' salaries have recently been cut by the @entity2 government , and @entity19 says she now earns 200 euros less than she did two years ago			1
she 's expecting another cut soon as her government explores more ways of saving money			0
working in @entity24 , however , will cushion that blow			2
" the truth is i get two salaries now , " she told @entity0			0
" one from @entity10 and one from here			2
" apart from the primary school where she goes in the morning , @entity19 teaches older kids at a @entity2 community center			0
she told @entity0 : " the community here asked the ministry of education back home to take care of this part of @entity10 which is in @entity24 , and it 's a strong part			1
" up to 50,000 @entity10 live in @entity24 , according to the consulate general of @entity10 in @entity70			1
community organizations have told @entity0 that they are receiving more job applications from electricians and artists desperate to escape the tough economic conditions in @entity10			0
when asked how she feels about the fact @entity2 teachers are losing their jobs back home while she is paid to teach foreigners , @entity19 insists she 's still serving her country			1
she said of her students : " their roots are in @entity10			0
their parents and grandparents do n't want them to lose their roots			0
in their hearts and their parents ' hearts @entity10 is always there			0
so i 'm still working for @entity10 , that 's for sure			0
" the number of @entity10 living in @entity24 has dropped sharply in the past decade			1
a report by the @entity94 of @entity10 abroad estimated that 100,000 expats lived in @entity24 in 2004 -- roughly twice the number living there today			1
@entity24 has its own unemployment problems , but a deficit in specialized skills could see the once dwindling @entity2 community burgeon again .			1

@entity2 teachers are finding work teaching the @entity2 language in @entity24
teachers pay for relocation to @entity24 but still receive salary from @entity2 government
up to 50,000 @entity10 live in @entity24 , according to @entity2 consulate in @entity70
