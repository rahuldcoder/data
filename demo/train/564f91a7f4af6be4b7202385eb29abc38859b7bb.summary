-- dozens of the @entity3 diplomatic cables obtained and published by @entity4 cover a worldwide phenomenon that has been persistently troubling to the @entity3 : drug trafficking			1
and those cables come not just from @entity8 , but from many corners of the world -- including @entity11 and several embassies in @entity13			1
perhaps most revealing is the cooperation between the @entity3 and @entity11 over trafficking through @entity16			1
a cable from august 2009 talks about multiple contacts between the @entity19 and @entity11 @entity20			1
the @entity11 were complaining that @entity16 smugglers were using " both @entity11 airspace and waters to transport narcotics ultimately destined for the @entity3 , but their repeated attempts to engage @entity16 on the issue have been ignored			1
" @entity11 officials had shown one plane to a @entity3 @entity19 official			1
on their way to a rendezvous in @entity34 waters , the crew had made an emergency landing after allegedly dumping 13 bales of marijuana in a rural area of @entity11			1
in another case , information from the @entity19 helped the @entity41 intercept a vessel carrying 700 kilograms of marijuana			0
the cable says that @entity11 officials " collectively and continually ... express frustration over the @entity46 's [ @entity16 's ] consistent ignoring of @entity11 attempts to increase the flow " of drug - related information between the two island nations to increase interdictions and avoid " being surprised by drugs			1
" despite translating information on boat and aircraft movements from @entity56 to @entity57 , @entity11 officials said their @entity16 counterparts rarely took action			1
but the @entity11 were not about to give their ideological enemy a free pass			2
" @entity63 [ @entity11 ] officials ultimately blame the @entity3 for this problem due to the high demand for illicit narcotics by @entity3 consumers , " concludes the cable			1
there seems as much concern about narcotics trafficking on the other side of the @entity72 , with @entity73 becoming a focus			2
one cable from last year even reports the request of @entity73 president @entity77 that screening devices be used for senior officials leaving the country " to avoid any surprises if they are caught carrying drugs			2
" " the president told the ambassador that he knows elements of his government are already compromised and that officials at the airport tipped off drug traffickers about operations there , " according to another cable from 2009			2
but the cable notes that previous scanning devices , known as itemizers , deployed to the vip lounge at @entity87 had been sabotaged			0
it quotes one @entity98 official involved in combatting drugs in @entity13 as saying " the filters were removed			2
" " he noted that the cost of maintenance on the itemizers is less than the cost of diverting flights on which passengers suffer drug overdoses			0
within the last few months ... @entity107 has diverted to @entity109 two flights from @entity87 to @entity110 because passengers started vomiting drugs			0
in both cases , the passenger died			0
" another cable notes that the @entity73 police had " lost a large amount of drugs kept in their possession that was to be used as evidence in future trials			0
" the @entity3 was building a secure room at police headquarters in which to store evidence			2
but there had also been some successes			0
one day last year , a container that had arrived at the @entity73 port of @entity131 marked as " chewing gum " raised the suspicion of customs officers " because it originated in @entity135 rather than the @entity136 , as usual			0
" they opened the container and found 71 kilograms of cocaine			0
last year , three men were extradited from @entity73 to face trial in @entity142 for alleged links to @entity145 extremists and drug traffickers , the " unholy alliance " that concerns @entity3 , @entity148 and @entity150 officials in @entity13			1
two were from @entity151 , which also comes under scrutiny in the leaked cables			0
one , from february this year , covers the history of an ancient @entity155 variously registered in @entity156 and @entity157 that had somehow become stranded at a desert airstrip in northern @entity151 in october 2009			0
not much surprise in that , as its airworthiness certificate had long ago expired			0
but that had not prevented someone from flying it across the @entity72 between @entity165 and a dried - up lake bed in northern @entity151 , according to officials from @entity157 quoted in the cable			0
just what the plane was carrying , and who was operating it , was still a mystery months after the crash because " not even the @entity178 of the @entity179 was allowed to make inquiries " -- and the regional @entity175 on @entity176 was not informed of whatever investigation was carried out			0
another cable from july of last year demonstrates the widespread concern of diplomats in @entity13 about " the institutionalization of drug and criminality in several @entity13 countries , especially along the coast			1
" one @entity98 diplomat " indicated that the @entity98 has a good understanding about how the drugs arrive to @entity13 , but not how they go @entity191 from there and how they are related to terrorist issues			2
" at the same meeting , a @entity3 diplomat expressed concern that " @entity198 networks in @entity13 might tap into the drug trade due to its high levels of profit			1
" the @entity203 guerrilla movement has established connections in @entity13 and @entity205 , according to drug enforcement sources .			1

@entity11 complained to @entity16 about drug smuggling
@entity3 , @entity11 officials cooperated on interdiction
cables show rising concern over @entity13
@entity3 worried about drug profits *funding* terrorism
