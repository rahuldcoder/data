-- when @entity2 set out to build @entity3 in the fall of 2003 , he was still trying to figure out exactly what the website should be			0
one conclusion he arrived at pretty early on was that it should n't be branded as a dating site			0
" i do n't think people would sign up for the facebook thing if they knew it was for dating , " @entity2 wrote at the time in an @entity11 chat with his close high school friend @entity12 , who became @entity3 's @entity13 and eventually went on to co-found @entity14			1
" i think people are skeptical about joining dating things too			0
" though the look and feel of @entity3 has changed in the years since , @entity2 and employees at the company have generally refrained from referring to the social network as a dating site , and from going after the online dating industry			1
that 's why it was so striking to see @entity3 tease a feature clearly intended for dating during the company 's big press event on tuesday for @entity32 , a new search engine that lets members use natural language to pull up recommendations for people , places and businesses from their social graph			1
@entity3 reps demonstrated several uses for the product , ranging from recruiting to searching for restaurant recommendations			0
then , at one point , a @entity3 employee stood on stage and searched for " friends of my friends who are single and living in @entity50			0
" with that simple line , @entity3 asserted itself as a potentially big player in the future of online dating			1
" @entity3 just announced that they are moving in on the essence of online dating , " said @entity55 , author of @entity56 in the @entity57 , a history of online dating and its impact on our culture , which comes out next tuesday			1
the bedrock of most dating sites , according to @entity55 , has been the ability to discover people you do n't know who share similar interests , whereas @entity3 's focus was on helping you find the people you do know			1
@entity32 changes that by making it much easier to search for people outside your immediate social circle			2
" that is a radical change for a community as big as @entity3			0
" with @entity32 , @entity3 members can search for other single users and filter the results based on their interests , education , age , hometown , current city and more — all while using natural language			1
if you want to find single women under the age of 35 who are from your hometown and now live in @entity96 , you can type exactly that into the search engine and see what pops up			0
can @entity3 really be used for online dating ? at first blush , it might seem obvious that @entity3 could be used for dating purposes			1
the social network has long served as a place to flirt by letting users advertise their relationship statuses , stalk one another 's updates and @entity110 people they might be interested in			2
indeed , one study last year from @entity112 found that about 10 % of couples who met online knew each other first in some other context and re-connected through a social network like @entity3			2
that said , several startups have tried in recent years to leverage @entity3 's social graph for dating , but with only mixed success			1
@entity120 raised $ 500,000 in early 2012 to use @entity3 for dating , but its first @entity3 application , @entity122 , struggled to take off and the company itself was later acquired by @entity124			2
@entity125 was able to rely on @entity3 data to help its users find people who shared connections and interests with them , but the problem the dating app faced was providing a way for users to get in touch with those people			2
" cold friending or cold messaging someone on @entity3 is uncomfortable because you do n't know if the other person wants to be approached			0
on @entity144 it 's not uncomfortable , it 's standard , " @entity142 , co-founder of @entity120 , told @entity143			0
the assumption is that everyone on @entity144 is interested in dating , but on @entity3 , even those who label themselves as " single " may not be in the market for a new relationship			2
" there is no way for the third party to signal that ' yes , i want a date to approach me			0
' " more fundamentally , @entity142 says that his company found @entity3 's @entity159 data was often not fresh or comprehensive enough to serve as a match - making tool			1
" @entity159 data is actually pretty sparse and stale , " @entity142 says			0
" if i asked you what your favorite movies are and went to your movies section on @entity3 , i do n't think they would match up			0
on @entity144 , people curate their profiles with a scalpel			0
" these two problems will likely limit the potential of @entity32 as a dating tool for now , but @entity142 suggests this could change in the future if @entity3 adds additional relationship status options like " looking for a date , " and if the social network can accrue enough real - time interest data for users from its partnerships with other websites			1
" someone is going to crack the nut of @entity3 dating , " @entity142 says			0
" it might well be @entity3			0
" a more casual place to date online the larger question then is whether @entity3 can or will ever take on the big players in the online dating space			1
investors appear to be concerned about this possibility , as the stock for @entity193 — the parent company of @entity194 and @entity144 — dropped by more than 2 % after @entity3 announced @entity32 on tuesday			1
" i think the online dating business has to be looking at this announcement and saying this could either be the best thing ever for us , or it could be @entity200 , " @entity55 says			2
if members of existing dating sites are successful in finding matches through @entity3 , it could cut into their business			0
on the other hand , @entity55 says , @entity3 could potentially help the industry by removing whatever " cultural barrier " remains for online dating			1
about a third of the single population in the @entity211 currently uses online dating sites — a number that has been relatively flat in recent years			2
both @entity55 and @entity142 suggest that @entity3 has the potential to make it more common for people to use the @entity216 to find dates , without necessarily stealing away many customers from other online dating sites			1
even before @entity3 made its big announcement , @entity55 says he noticed that a growing number of non-dating platforms are being used for dating purposes , from match - making apps on @entity226 to social discovery tools like @entity228			2
meanwhile , he says some dating websites are starting to re-brand a bit by taking the " pink hearts " off their homepage with the goal of being a little more welcoming to those who might previously have been put off by the idea of online dating			0
@entity3 could fit nicely in this trend by serving as a more general social venue where casual users occasionally browse for dates without necessarily branding themselves as online daters			1
" it 's very similar to going to a club or a poetry reading or whatever your thing is [ to meet people ] , " @entity55 says , whereas " online dating is more like going to a speed - dating event			1
" at least in this sense , @entity3 could help online dating function a little more like offline dating			1

@entity3 's new @entity32 will let people search , say , for young single people in their city
