@entity5 's @entity4 and @entity7 's @entity6 were the latest managers to criticize the heavy @entity10 schedule during the festive period but while the duo lamented their teams playing four games in 13 days , fans in @entity1 and around the world continue to enjoy the action on offer			1
the @entity10 is , after all , the only major football league not to shut down over the holidays			2
some supporters had more reason to cheer than others , and on that note , here 's a look at the winners and losers in the @entity10 during its busiest time of the season			1
winners @entity28 : one of the standout results over the @entity31 period had to be defending champion @entity28 slumping to a 2 - 2 draw with @entity34 -- at home and after holding a 2 - 0 second - half lead			1
but that was the lone blemish for @entity39 's men , despite nearly squandering another two - goal advantage at home to @entity7 on @entity42			0
@entity28 collected 10 of 12 points , scoring 11 goals in the process without talismanic striker @entity46			1
@entity28 was also without the services of the perhaps equally influential @entity48 in the heart of the defense			2
once eight points behind @entity52 , @entity28 and the @entity53 are now level atop the table			1
@entity55 : @entity56 proved to be a hurricane that stormed past @entity52 on thursday			1
he scored twice , assisted on another and won a penalty in the stunning 5 - 3 victory over a team that had previously had @entity55 's number			2
with fellow strikers @entity64 and @entity66 continuing to misfire , his emergence has come at the right time for @entity55			2
@entity56 , @entity68 and @entity69 make for an impressive attacking trio			2
@entity55 -- like @entity28 -- earned three wins and a draw to climb to fifth , only two points behind @entity74 in the race for the final @entity77 spot in @entity1			1
@entity74 : a freefall down the table , some would have said , was inevitable for the @entity74 after they lost five straight games heading into the @entity31 rush			2
yet @entity74 turned it around in a hurry , gathering 10 points			1
it beat the struggling duo of @entity87 and @entity88 prior to drawing @entity52 and downing @entity89			1
sure the referee might have helped @entity74 against @entity52 -- not awarding a seemingly clear penalty to the visitor -- but @entity74 bossed proceedings against @entity89			1
for all the talk this season of striker @entity95 and midfielder @entity96 , do n't forget the work of fullbacks @entity99 and @entity101			0
@entity102 : winless in 10 games , @entity102 manager @entity103 was hoping for respite on @entity106 against @entity7			0
when @entity108 scored for the @entity7 in the first minute , though , it seemed like more bad luck was on the way for @entity102			0
@entity102 , however , rallied for a 3 - 1 win and better form followed			0
after somehow losing to @entity113 1 - 0 -- hitting the post twice and firing 19 shots -- the @entity116 eased past @entity87 2 - 0 to rise to 15th			0
@entity34 : how could a team that amassed a mere two points in four games be a ' winner , ' you ask ? well , @entity34 , seemingly doomed for relegation in october , showed plenty of grit even with a thin squad -- manager @entity126 named the same starting @entity127 in all four games			0
the lack of rotation cost @entity126 on thursday , since he had to make three injury enforced subs within 40 minutes , but @entity34 still rallied three times to draw @entity134 away 3 - 3			0
as if coming back against @entity28 was n't enough			0
the two losses were narrow defeats to @entity55 and @entity137			0
if @entity138 is a sentimental favorite in @entity140 , @entity141 -- now a point off safety -- is the @entity10 equivalent			0
losers @entity87 : the honeymoon period is over for @entity147			2
adored by the @entity87 fans last season -- enjoying success with a more attractive style than @entity152 ' methodical approach -- @entity147 's team lost all four games			1
it scored in only one of them			0
lingering near a @entity77 place early in the season , @entity87 now finds itself a mere four points above the relegation zone			2
@entity162 : @entity152 ' former assistant at @entity87 , @entity164 , did n't last long in his first stint as manager , getting fired after the sagging @entity162 lost 2 - 0 to @entity167			1
but here 's good news for the @entity162 faithful : @entity171 is on the way			2
@entity171 has never been relegated as a manager and is the reigning manager of the season in the @entity10 , working wonders at @entity88 before leaving the @entity88 on the eve of the current campaign			1
@entity88 : @entity164 was n't the first manager to go in the @entity10 this season			1
that ' honor ' went to @entity181 at @entity88 following a 3 - 1 home defeat to @entity74 on @entity106			1
@entity181 's second stint in charge at @entity185 started well enough but the team has won once since late september			0
@entity181 said publicly that @entity88 needed strikers and it 's not difficult to see why with a return of 20 goals			2
in the last seven , @entity88 has netted twice			0
former @entity88 midfielder @entity190 is set to take over from @entity181			0
@entity191 : when @entity191 won three of its four first league games this season , relegation troubles appeared to be an afterthought			0
and despite @entity191 still being five points above the bottom three , it 's hard to imagine its fans content			0
@entity88 's dearth in front of goal is nothing compared to @entity191 , which has scored 11 times in 20 games			1
in three draws and a loss in the past fortnight , the @entity207 - based club found the back of the net once			0
@entity52 : the festive period began perfectly for @entity52			1
playing at one of the toughest grounds in @entity1 , the @entity213 beat @entity167 2 - 0			0
then came another 2 - 0 win , against a then in - form @entity217			0
but slip - ups ensued at @entity74 and @entity55 , with @entity52 manager @entity220 not happy with the referee on both occasions			1
a @entity220 team has always won the league when it has led at the @entity225 , but @entity52 's dip has given @entity28 hope .			1

@entity52 dropped five points in its last two games during the festive period
but @entity28 *prospered* in the @entity10 , taking 10 of 12 points
other teams to *excel* *included* @entity56 's @entity55 and @entity74
@entity87 , @entity88 and @entity162 all struggled , though
