-- @entity1 wants to tap into the kinder , gentler side of gaming			1
the player takes flight in " cloud , " a video game distributed by thatgamecompany			2
the president and co-founder of thatgamecompany is finding success in the video game industry with titles like " flower , " " flow " and " cloud			1
" the mellow interactive experiences are definitely different from the more violent " spray - and - slay " video games on the market and are designed to encourage emotion , innovation and creativity			1
in " flower , " the player journeys through an imaginary landscape where they can blow breezes , collect flower petals and enjoy the colorful landscape of what @entity33 says is a " video game version of a poem			1
" such creativity seems to be in perfect harmony with the 30 - year - old video game developer , who has a background in the performing arts			0
a graduate of @entity45 's @entity44 , @entity33 worked with incorporating digital and interactive media with live performance before she discovered another passion			1
it was while completing a master 's in fine arts at the @entity53 at the @entity55 's @entity54 that @entity33 realized she could marry her love of the arts with video game creation			1
" that attraction i had to working on original theater works was very similar , " she said			0
" i had grown up with video games ; i was definitely a gamer all my life , and i had just never thought about it as a creative medium			1
" as soon as i did , it was just really exciting , because i saw this huge , untapped potential and a lot of things that had n't been done before , " she added			0
" while at @entity55 , she worked on a student project called " cloud , " a downloadable pc game , which only a few months after release online had been played by 350,000 people			1
" in comparison to every single play i probably ever worked on in combination never saw that large an audience , " said @entity33 , whose company released " cloud " as one of its games			1
" that was really exciting			0
" @entity33 is returning to her alma mater monday as a speaker for @entity55 , an independently organized @entity91 event , which has @entity0 as one of its supporters			1
@entity91 stands for technology , entertainment and design and began 25 years ago as a conference to bring together some of the world 's greatest minds			2
@entity101 is vice provost and executive director of the @entity103 as well as the curator of @entity55			2
she said @entity55 is an ideal location for the event , which has a theme of " @entity108 , " because of its diverse , entrepreneurial and innovative environment			2
" it 's a great opportunity to bring together leading minds both from on - campus and off - campus to share ideas , to hear new ideas and be inspired to come up with their own ideas to make a real impact , " she said			0
making an impact is exactly what @entity33 had in mind when she and fellow @entity55 graduate @entity122 launched thatgamecompany			1
the company , though small and independent , has received many positive reviews of its games and last year was honored as one of the " 20 @entity129 " of the year by @entity130			2
two of its games have been released on the @entity134 platform			0
although the gaming industry is mostly dominated by men , @entity33 said , she has always been treated as an equal among her peers			2
and although the main demographic for video games is young men , @entity33 said , there is another audience			1
" the average gamer now is 35 years old , " she said			0
" because the audiences are maturing and simultaneously we have a generation of people who 've grown up with games who are entering the industry , it 's sort of now our turn to create			0
" @entity153 , publisher for @entity154 and author of " get @entity156 , " said @entity33 is one of several women making a splash in the world of gaming			0
@entity153 said @entity33 , who is also an invited speaker at the @entity162 this week in @entity163 , @entity164 , has achieved a level of visibility because of the quality of her work and the fact that she is a great game designer			2
" these are games that push boundaries that appeal to folks of all ages , interests and genders , " he said			0
@entity33 's games stand out , he said , because they differ so greatly from what many think of when they think video games			1
" that 's part of what makes them so appealing is the fact that the offer something so different , " he said			0
" they are unique , something audiences have n't seen before			0
a lot of them actually border on being virtual art experiences more so than video games			1
" the nice part about it is , they can be consumed at a very leisurely pace ; they can be consumed in bite - sized sessions , " @entity153 added			0
" these are the types of titles that we need as an industry to help broaden our horizons			0
" @entity33 remembers her first experience playing video games on an arcade version of " @entity210 " that she and her brother tackled while her mother shopped at the supermarket			1
and although she says she does n't think it 's dangerous for children to play violent video games , @entity33 does see danger in doing so without having recognition of the violence			1
from her games , she says , she wants players to take away the feeling that , like with any communicative medium , there is a relationship with a game			0
" one of the questions we always get is , are we always going to make emotional games , " @entity33 said			2
" we are saying all games are emotional			0

@entity1 's company produces video games meant to inspire
@entity33 *approaches* games as art
titles like " flow " and " cloud " are *alternatives* to violent video games
