there are few certainties in @entity3 politics			2
but you can write it down : if @entity7 wants to be the next nominee of the @entity9 to be president , the job is hers			1
@entity11 , @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 and the others in the long list of commander - in - chief wannabes will go about their day jobs for the next couple years , but at the back of their minds will be only one question : will she or wo n't she ? because , as the most popular politician in @entity3 -- who also happens to be married to @entity3 's most popular ex-president and who has in place a nationwide network of donors , campaign staffers and committed supporters -- @entity33 has the power to keep potential rivals from raising money or gaining political traction simply by saying , " i have n't decided what my plans are			1
" she 's in control			1
that she should be in such a position at this moment is a remarkable achievement and an extraordinary testament to her grit , gifts and track record : she has been the most successful @entity3 secretary of state in two decades			1
that outcome was hardly a foregone conclusion when @entity52 made the bold decision to pick his former primary rival to assume the oldest and most senior post in the @entity56			2
she had , after all , lost a bruising campaign to him , there was tension between her team and his and no reason to assume the two ex-rivals would work together			2
she had never run a large organization before			2
beyond that , the @entity3 was facing massive crises at home and bewildering complexity abroad			2
many of the issues she would be facing would be new to her			2
@entity33 was so famous already that she could easily be seen to be upstaging the president , something that would have undone her within the administration and made her look bad			1
@entity75 : can @entity76 change ' the stupid party ? ' her tour de force performance this week before @entity79 and @entity80 committees looking into the @entity82 tragedy illustrated how far she has come			1
in a charged political environment , she commanded the stage and deftly repulsed effort after effort by @entity89 partisans to shift the focus away from what the lessons of the attacks were and should be , turning aside their theories of conspiracy and devious motives for the missteps surrounding the event			1
she defended the president and revealed her character by accepting responsibility			1
she had already set the stage with her swift embrace of a blue - ribbon investigation into the incident and her acceptance of its recommendations for avoiding such problems in the future			2
she was helped by the bipartisan recognition of her extraordinary tenure at @entity112 ; her work ethic , miles traveled and commitment were praised throughout both hearings			0
most importantly , @entity33 clearly knew her brief better than any of those questioning her			0
when sen. @entity120 of @entity121 attempted to score political points with a cynical line of questioning , she showed her strength and stature as a leader with a direct , unwavering response urging him to focus on the bigger issues at hand			1
when sen. @entity132 announced that had he been president he would have fired her , her response evinced an understanding of the issues and processes at play ; it was evident that only one of the two of them had any chance of occupying the @entity141 in the future			1
when describing the return of the caskets of the @entity3 victims in the @entity82 attack , she showed her humanity			0
frequently , she showed the comfort with the setting that comes from her experience not just at @entity112 but as a senator			0
opinion : @entity132 vs. @entity7 : clash of the titans @entity33 's virtuosity in such situations is no accident , nor is it a surprise to any who have watched her grow , first as a senator and then at @entity112			1
having been tested as few have been by the extraordinary stresses she faced as first lady , she famously earned her stripes in the upper chamber of our @entity165 by being " a workhorse not a show horse			0
" her close aides at @entity112 speak with some awe about her hours spent immersed in her briefing papers , her questioning of her staff and top experts to get up to speed , and her political skill in translating her conclusions into actions			1
she has worked on forging not only a good working relationship with the president but also in building key alliances in the @entity56 , notably with former secretary of defense @entity182 and top officials in the military and the intelligence community			1
when the @entity80 limited her brief and asserted control over key issues , from the appointment of ambassadors to a host of issues in the @entity193 , she found alternative paths to make a difference			0
the " pivot " to @entity203 was one concrete example of her success -- not as merely a policy concept but as an initiative made real by active , intensive diplomacy throughout the region			0
she helped restore @entity3 relations worldwide that had been damaged by the bull - in - a - china - shop policies of the @entity207 administration			0
she actively worked to reshape the @entity3 international agenda for the 21st century , focusing on emerging powers , new technologies and populations -- like the role of women worldwide -- long neglected by the @entity3 foreign policy establishment			0
she led the way for the @entity3 to be more active in @entity216 , to manage unprecedented international sanctions against @entity218 , to stand up to the @entity219 in the @entity220			0
indeed , perhaps most importantly , at a time when the @entity3 faced distractions and new constraints at home and a national desire to avoid military entanglements worldwide , she recognized that our greatest tools going forward would be active diplomacy and repaired alliances , and she restored them to centrality in @entity3 foreign policy			0
it is a stand - out record , one that makes her the equal of the likes of @entity237 , @entity238 or @entity239 among our leading modern secretaries of state			1
what is more , she achieved her success by promoting a more humanist international agenda than her peers at the first ranks of @entity3 foreign policy leaders			0
at the same time , she maintained a centrist course more comfortable with the appropriate use of force than many of her more liberal colleagues in the @entity52 administration			0
maintaining such a balance requires exceptional skill			0
to do so for four years under the conditions she faced is among the reasons she is so widely admired			0
@entity7 is likely to be the next @entity9 presidential nominee because she is the best - known active @entity9 politician , because she has repeatedly triumphed over adversity , because she has made herself well - liked at a time that politicians are typically viewed with contempt			1
but she is likely to be the next president , the first woman to be president of the @entity3 , because of the quality of her character and her work on behalf of the @entity3 people			2
with some luck she will use the next two years to restore her energy and prepare for what lies ahead			0
because regardless of what political party in which you may find yourself , it is hard to deny that she elevates our political discourse in ways that few , if any , others do on the contemporary stage .			1

@entity284 says if @entity7 runs in 2016 , she *'ll* likely be the next president
he says she 's most popular politician in country , has political traction and *funders* in place
he says she 's *excelled* as secretary of state , *overcome* adversity , shown political wits
@entity284 : whatever your party , hard to deny she lifts political discourse like few others
