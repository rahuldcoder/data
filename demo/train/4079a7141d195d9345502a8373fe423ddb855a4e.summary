attorney @entity0 challenged comedian @entity1 , hounded by allegations of sexual assault , to meet his accusers in court or set aside $ 100 million to settle their claims			1
" the public deserves to know if mr. @entity1 is a saint or a sexual predator , " @entity0 said			1
because many of the claims of sexual assault are decades old , @entity1 would have to agree to waive the statute of limitations , allowing his accusers to sue him			1
" it could be advantageous for mr. @entity1 to give up the statute of limitations because there is a huge cloud on his reputation and legacy , " @entity0 said on wednesday			1
but she also offered a second option			0
@entity1 could put $ 100 million into a fund and anyone who claims she was a victim could file and have a panel of retired judges decide the merits of the case and award compensation			1
" we challenge mr. @entity1 to end this nightmare for both him and the alleged victims by accepting either of the options , " @entity0 said			1
there was no immediate response from @entity1 's lawyer @entity34			1
@entity0 made the offer at a news conference flanked by three women who say they were sexually assaulted by the entertainer			1
two of them represent new accusers			0
two of the women allege they were drugged by @entity1 and sexually assaulted in the 1980s			1
a third woman said @entity1 followed her and her friends around at a celebrity tennis tournament in 1973			2
she said he later grabbed her right breast at a restaurant			0
@entity1 has defenders a lawsuit the latest allegations came a day after another women , @entity53 , filed a lawsuit in @entity55 , claiming sexual battery and infliction of emotional distress during an incident at the @entity60 , according to the documents first obtained by @entity62			1
the alleged sexual assault took place in 1974 when @entity53 was 15 years old			1
according to court documents , @entity53 and a 16 - year - old friend met @entity1 when he was filming a movie at @entity68 in @entity69			2
after talking with the girls , the suit alleges , @entity1 invited them to his tennis club the following saturday , " where he served them alcoholic beverages and played games of billiards			2
" they then went to the @entity60 where , the lawsuit says , @entity1 asked @entity53 to sit on a bed beside him , after she came out of a bathroom			1
" he then proceeded to sexually molest her by attempting to put his hand down her pants , and then taking her hand in his hand and performing a sex act on himself without her consent			0
" in a pleading filed thursday , @entity1 attorney @entity34 said @entity53 's claims are " absolutely false " and accused her of engaging in extortion after @entity1 rejected her " outrageous demand for money in order not to make her allegations public			1
" " through her lawyer , @entity99 made extortionate threats to mr. @entity1 ( through his counsel ) about criminal penalties , coupled with ever - increasing demands for a six - figure payday to keep quiet about her long - since expired claims , " @entity34 said			2
@entity34 added that @entity53 claimed she did n't remember the abuse until recently -- which he said in some cases could provide for an exception to the statute of limitations -- but tried to sell the story to a media outlet 10 years ago			2
he asked the court to impose monetary sanctions of $ 33,295 in court and legal fees			0
@entity118 has tried to contact @entity53 and her attorneys but has not heard back from them either			2
@entity1 facing litany of allegations ' horrible , horrendous allegations ' the suit goes on to call @entity1 's alleged actions " malicious , oppressive and fraudulent in nature			1
" " this traumatic incident , at such a tender age , has caused psychological damage and mental anguish for ( @entity132 ) that has caused her significant problems throughout her life since the incident			0
" the case describes the damage as " substantial and continuing			0
" @entity53 is asking for damages and legal fees			0
because four decades have passed since the alleged crime , it was n't immediately clear if the case falls within the statute of limitations in @entity146 for child sex abuse			2
it 's because of that lag in time that @entity118 legal analyst @entity150 says he thinks @entity1 's legal team will ask for the lawsuit to be dismissed			1
" it 's highly problematic , and it 's likely the lawsuit will not stand , " he said			0
with the allegations mounting , @entity118 political contributor @entity155 said that now is the time for @entity1 to speak up			1
" at some point , his silence becomes almost kind of an admission , " he said			0
" these are horrible , horrendous allegations			0
" @entity1 has not commented on the allegations , leaving that to his lawyer			2
in a recent statement , @entity34 said it defies common sense that " so many people would have said nothing , done nothing , and made no reports to law enforcement or asserted civil claims if they thought they had been assaulted over a span of so many years			0
" by @entity118 's count , at least 20 women have gone public with accusations			1
" he owes this country			0
he owes the women some kind of statement , " said @entity155 , who is also an attorney			2
" i think this level of silence for this long is unfair to everybody			0
" another allegation @entity53 's lawsuit was filed on the same day that @entity189 published a story in which a man named @entity192 alleges he rescued a female friend from @entity1 's @entity195 brownstone in 1984			1
the article describes @entity192 beating on the comedian 's front door after receiving a frantic phone call from the woman , who said , " @entity192 , you 've got to come get me			0
" after @entity1 answered the door , the story says , @entity192 found his friend on the second floor of the home			0
" she looked drugged and in a fog , and she could n't snap out of it , " he said			0
" she was a mess			0
" the @entity189 reports this same woman was a witness in a sex assault lawsuit against @entity1 , filed in 2005			2
that case was settled before going to trial .			0
