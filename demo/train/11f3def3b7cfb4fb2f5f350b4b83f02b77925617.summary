@entity0 , @entity1 -- going back to work after my wife had our first child was an emotional roller coaster			1
the author says that being " mr. @entity9 " is appealing , but putting the idea into practice is harder than it looks			1
i forced myself out of bed , shaved my beard and got dressed on the morning of my return			0
i performed these work week rituals while cursing the fact that i matched only one number on my last lottery ticket , so i had to show up that day			1
after being out of the office for a little more than two weeks on paternity leave , i knew the transition back to work would be tough			1
i coped with this fact , like any rational new parent would , by increasing the number of lottery tickets that i purchased			0
saying goodbye took a while			0
i made several trips up and down the stairs to get one more glimpse of my daughter before succumbing to the inevitable : my commute , fighting traffic and reintegrating to cubicle culture			1
i arrived at the office still thinking of my family at home without me			1
i found myself misty - eyed at the water cooler while i waited for @entity41 to load several hundred unread e-mails			2
at that moment , i wanted nothing more than to be at home with my daughter			1
the idea of being a stay - at - home dad , like @entity46 in " mr. @entity9 , " always appealed to me			1
for the uninitiated , the 1983 comedy is about an out - of - work father faced with domestic challenges while his wife gets a job			1
a memorable scene has the title character , @entity56 , trying to sound like he knows what he 's talking about to his wife 's new boss			2
he tells him that he plans to wire a new wing of his house in " 220 , 221 , whatever it takes			1
" i identify with the latter part of his character 's claim			2
it 's not like me to pretend to know anything about home improvement , but when it comes to caring for my family while balancing my responsibilities at work , i plan on doing whatever it takes			1
in 2007 , 37 percent of working dads admitted that they would leave their jobs if their family could afford it , according to @entity80			1
the " if " in that statistic is a big one			0
unlike the characters in " mr. @entity9 , " my wife and i both need to work			1
a good sequel to this film may have explored the hijinks that ensued from an overwhelmed parent caring for a newborn while working from home			1
nowadays , there 's support for all of the @entity94 out there			2
web sites such as @entity97 and @entity98 have established online communities dedicated to providing tips and resources for fatherhood			0
these forums represent a growing fellowship where those with experience can help new dads			2
personally , i have n't utilized them much yet because of that old @entity109 joke about not wanting to be a member of a club that would have a person like me as a member			0
available resources and social acceptance for stay - at - home dads have come a long way since " mr. @entity9 's " portrayal of them			1
in fact , @entity120 calculated that a stay - at - home dad was worth $ 125,340 a year for the dad portion of his work in 2006			1
this analysis took into account tasks that range from cooking and cleaning to teaching and serving as a child psychologist			0
since i ca n't convince anyone to pay me my estimated worth as an at - home dad -- and living on one salary is n't an option for my family -- i 've considered working from home a couple of hours a week when necessary			1
flexible work schedules make sense because they benefit a company by allowing employees to be more productive on their terms			2
nevertheless , working from home may not be for everyone			1
i work for a news web site , facilitating advertisement opportunities			2
a lot of my job 's communication occurs via e-mail , which is something i can do at home			1
i 'd worked from home before , but not with a newborn in the house			2
my first test was only for a couple of hours when the baby was about 3 weeks old			0
my wife had an early appointment , and i was going to watch the baby sleep , hopefully , and then go into the office after she got home			2
i had e-mail to check and two conference calls scheduled back - to - back during that time			1
i did n't expect this to be too difficult			0
i caught up on the e-mail much earlier than if i had gone into the office that morning			0
unfettered from the restriction of the morning rituals , my productivity was already soaring and i was ahead of schedule			0
as i called into my first meeting , the baby started to stir , squirm and make her signature sounds ( a primal series of grunts , snorts and whimpers )			0
she was telling me that her diaper needed to be changed and that she was probably hungry , too			0
so i did what any multi-tasker would do : i put the phone under my ear , stuck her bottle under the tap , muted the phone , ran up the stairs with her in a tucked football position , unmuted the phone , answered a question , muted again , changed her diaper and ran down the stairs to get the bottle			0
my wife called while i was juggling the baby , diaper , bottle and meeting to let me know that she was running late			0
i screamed to myself , " i need help now ! " allowing the nervous breakdown to run its course , i continued to pace across my living room floor -- regretting that i had n't chosen decaf that morning			0
a few minutes later , i jumped out of the first meeting to call into the second			2
i said , " hello , this is @entity203 , i 'm here on mute , ok , thanks			0
" as i listened in on mute , i shushed my baby to calm her -- to no avail			0
her cries became increasingly louder			0
my boss asked , " @entity203 , are you there ? " i unmuted my phone and right on cue , my daughter screamed at the top of her little lungs			2
the conference room on the other end of the phone erupted with laughter , and i told them that i 'd have to get back to them			2
my wife arrived home shortly after the conference - call debacle			1
i told her that i did n't think it would be a good idea for me to work from home anymore			1
i realize that the ability to work and be a nanny simultaneously is a skill requiring practice			0
one trial run as a telecommuter with a newborn has caused me to question the feasibility of being able to do it on a regular basis			0
perhaps it 's time for me to forget about that old @entity109 joke and accept some help			0
wait , the baby 's crying , sorry , got ta go .			0
