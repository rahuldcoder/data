@entity0 -- the turbulent political environment and a flood of outside spending from @entity5 backed @entity6 are throwing @entity8 @entity7 on defense twenty days before the midterm elections , and they are putting out the call for help from their allies			1
money once earmarked to try to knock off @entity15 in competitive seats is now being used to prop up @entity18 members watching millions of dollars in television attack ads air in their districts funded by @entity5 backed outside groups			2
" tough and unpredictable " and " admittedly difficult " were two phrases used by @entity24 , @entity26 - @entity25 , the chairman of the @entity27 , @entity8 @entity7 ' campaign arm used to describe the landscape to reporters on @entity30 on wednesday			1
while @entity7 were never in position to compete for control of the @entity8 they did go into the midterms with the goal to pick up some seats in districts president @entity31 won in 2012			1
now the objective is to minimize losses on their own side , and hope that the @entity8 @entity5 majority does n't grow to a number that makes their objective of taking back the @entity8 in the next national election in 2016 insurmountable			1
@entity47 admitted his candidates face headwinds this fall , but does n't see anything like the wave in the last midterm in 2010 that washed democrats out of the @entity8 majority and took many candidates by surprise			2
he pointed out that on average the president 's party loses 29 @entity8 seats in midterm elections			2
and the @entity25 @entity64 said the lesson of 2010 was to prepare his colleagues for the worst case scenario in 2014 and prioritize current @entity8 members ' races over those of @entity18 challengers			0
a senior @entity8 @entity18 aide confirms that resources are being moved away from targets in red districts to shore up democrats on defense against @entity5 attacks			0
money reserved for @entity27 television ads in @entity82 's sixth congressional district , where @entity18 challenger @entity83 is hoping to oust @entity5 rep @entity84 has been canceled			0
the @entity8 @entity7 ' campaign arm pulled resources way from a race in @entity88 to replace a retiring @entity5 , where @entity18 challenger @entity89 is competing against former @entity8 @entity5 aide @entity90			1
the campaign cash is instead being directed to help people like freshman @entity95 rep @entity93 , who just had @entity5 outside groups drop well over a million into tv spots just last week			0
but @entity47 insisted that his long term strategy to organize early and send 700 field staff to key races around the country has kept a group of more than 30 @entity8 races still in the competitive column			0
the @entity18 campaign chief repeatedly used the session with reporters to communicate a plea to outside donors and advocacy groups supportive of @entity7 that it 's not too late to stop the bleeding			1
" in a world of @entity116 hurt , the pain can be ameliorated , and in some cases reversed , when some of our outside allies decide they are not going to leave a single race on the table and they come in and help fortify some of our candidates , " @entity47 said wednesday			2
by law the @entity27 ca n't coordinate political strategy and resources with outside groups			0
so @entity47 used the press to send the message			0
" it is frustrating that the cavalry that has always been there does n't seem to be there			0
" he argued that @entity18 allies should n't just help @entity7 , who are in jeopardy of losing their majority , but they could focus on both chambers and that 20 days remaining amounted to " an eternity " in the political world			1
a spokeswoman for the @entity8 @entity5 's campaign committee said @entity47 's focus on outside factors ignored the drag that the president was having on congressional @entity7			1
" chairman @entity47 needs stop the @entity0 blame game and admit that president @entity31 and his devastating policies are casting a large shadow over the landscape for @entity158 , " @entity149 , spokeswoman for the @entity150 said in a written statement			0
in a sign of how difficult nov. 4th is likely to be for @entity158 , @entity47 acknowledged that @entity7 were having a tough time competing against @entity25 @entity161 congressman @entity161 , who faces a 20 count federal indictment for mail fraud , wire fraud , filing false tax returns , hiring unauthorized aliens and perjury			1
@entity47 declined to outline how many seats would remain in @entity18 hands after voters cast their ballots			2
but it was clear he was already ready to move onto the next election cycle , saying of @entity5 the day after the election , " they wake up to a really hostile environment going into 2016 and part of this was laying that infrastructure long term			0
