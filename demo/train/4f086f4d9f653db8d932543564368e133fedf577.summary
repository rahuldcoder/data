-- @entity1 is on the roller - coaster of transition			1
it 's a bumpy and hair - raising ride to a destination unknown			2
but the country is moving			2
and in that , there 's hope			2
in @entity11 last friday , i was struck by the carnival atmosphere : vendors sold candied apples and baked yams ; young boys hawked red , white and - black hats and flags ; a crowd gathered to watch cartoonists chalk an oversized military general dressed as @entity23			1
activists of all political shades shouted poetry and enthusiastic speeches , leading crowds in chanting : " the people want the end of the military regime ! " " the people want a civilian regime ! " " we are all one ! " but by saturday , @entity11 had become a battleground			1
crowds shrunk to die - hards throwing stones and @entity38 cocktails , while security forces volleyed tear gas and rubber bullets			2
from the 18th floor of the locked - down @entity44 ( a barrage of tear gas having abruptly aborted my attempt to speak to those at the edges of the square ) , i watched as the square cleared out , battles moved to side streets , and then the atmosphere turned quiet			0
political leaders across the spectrum aired televised condemnation of the police and support for the protesters			0
and people started streaming again through the streets , across a nearby bridge , and back into the square			0
it was a sight reminiscent of the nail - biting days of january			0
with such off - and - on violence , and rising numbers of dead and injured , some may wonder if democracy is worth it -- or even possible			1
many @entity1 are no longer as beamingly optimistic as they were last spring			1
then , they dreamed of blooming democracy and booming economies			2
today , they want stability			0
tourism has slowed to a trickle , and taxi drivers , hotel workers and souvenir vendors shake their heads at the demonstrators			0
capital is fleeing , and foreign reserves drying up			0
as people speak their minds , many others -- from liberals to conservatives â € ” feel uneasy			0
large numbers of bearded men and covered women , demanding a regime based on @entity94 law , frighten @entity95 and @entity96 alike			0
clashes between @entity98 and @entity96 create fear that religious strife will rend @entity1 's multireligious society			1
and women especially worry that their freedoms are at stake			2
liberals , far less numerous , can also be intimidating			0
many in @entity1 believe they do not understand or accept " real " @entity1 society and threaten to corrupt it			1
last month , a female blogger posted nude pictures of herself and others in a sensational appeal to expand freedom of expression			0
it led many to complain that too much freedom would corrupt @entity1 society			1
anger against @entity117 and @entity118 also worry many			2
a 20 - something @entity1 , working for a foreign corporation in @entity1 , pulled me aside in @entity11 to explain that former president @entity122 had known where to draw the line			1
these people , he exclaimed , gesturing to those around him , do n't understand the hadud , or limits			0
like others , he said he worries they would trade @entity1 's welfare for the @entity133 ' cause			1
but even amid conflict and uncertainty , there 's hope			0
@entity1 who desperately want to escape from nearly 60 years of military - backed authoritarian rule have what it takes to do so			1
airwaves are filled with nationalist songs , and @entity1 flags abound			1
friday 's calls to end the military regime mingled with expressions of nationalism			2
huge crowds chanted in unison : " @entity95 and @entity96 , we 're all @entity1 , we are all one , " and , most directly , " @entity151 ! " ( " i am @entity1 ! " ) there is also strong respect for elections			1
at @entity11 , parties and candidates took advantage of the gathering to distribute pamphlets and urge demonstrators to vote for pro-revolutionary forces			1
and even with the descent into violence , forces across the political spectrum have urged elections to begin as scheduled			2
@entity1 in the square hotly contested the nature of the @entity1 military and goals for the future			1
the @entity173 ( " @entity179 " ) called for a regime based on @entity94 law ; the @entity176 appealed to secular nationalism ; and the @entity178 demanded a civilian , democratic regime with respect and freedoms for all			2
as one in friday 's crowd argued , many @entity1 may need to develop respect for diverging opinions			1
yet this is true in many nascent democracies			0
political forces also are well - organized			0
the @entity178 not only can bring people onto the streets , but also send them home when the time is right			0
they were critical in rallying crowds last week , where they maintained a space for women to avoid being crushed and jostled by men and a pathway for demonstrators to navigate the crowd			0
and they were instrumental in returning crowds to @entity11 late saturday night			1
other forces , too , are gaining strength			0
in fact , tuesday 's crowds -- despite the @entity178 ' refusal to participate in the demonstrations -- show that others , too , can mobilize forces			0
with a strong sense of nationalism , hotly contested debates , a belief in electoral democracy and organized political forces , @entity1 has what it takes to form democracy			1
it just wo n't be easy or fast			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity223 .			1

@entity223 : @entity1 in bumpy transition ; daily @entity11 goes from *festive* to *combative*
she says some there worry democracy might not be worth it ; social conflicts so *challenging*
she says optimism has faded for many in face of worries over economy and @entity240 control
lust : still , @entity1 has essentials for democracy : strong nationalism , faith in elections
