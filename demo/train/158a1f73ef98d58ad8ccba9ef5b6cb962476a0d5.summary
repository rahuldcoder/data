-- $ 1.3 billion is enough money to buy the @entity2 or a big stake in the @entity5 government			1
that 's just about the amount candidates and special interest groups backed by global corporations , billionaires and millionaires will spend on political ads before @entity13 in an attempt to sell you @entity5 's @entity16			2
as big money floods the midterms , it drowns out the voices of " we the people			1
" @entity25 's @entity24 state sen. @entity23 gets it			1
he writes , " as money in politics increases , the role of the general public in our democracy diminishes , more and more citizens feel their vote does not matter , and fewer are compelled into public service			1
" that 's exactly what 's happening			0
with just days left to go before the november 4 election , only about 15 % of @entity5 are closely paying attention to it			0
the rest of us -- the sane ones -- have just tuned it out			0
but we should n't be joking			0
big money has diminished our most important and fundamental right as @entity5 citizens : the right to vote			1
the result is a government of , by and for fat cats and plutocrats			1
just look northeast to @entity23 's great state of @entity25			1
besides potatoes , blueberries and lobster , the @entity25 boasts clean elections			1
this system of publicly financed elections makes it easier for citizens to run for elected office , especially those who lack membership in the @entity65			2
after the @entity58 law ( first in the nation ) was enacted in 2000 , the number of female candidates increased , with 84 % of women who ran for public office citing it as very or somewhat important in their decision to run			1
@entity25 also saw a huge drop in the average number of uncontested races -- from 31 to three -- as well as a surge in voter turnout that continues to outpace the national average			2
by 2008 , more than 80 % of candidates in @entity25 were running their campaigns with public funding , without any special interest money			1
the law was praised and used by @entity85 and @entity24			0
for once , everybody seemed to agree on something			0
after a decade of success , the clean election system was hit by a rash of bad news -- damaging court decisions , severe budget cuts , legislative action and inaction , gubernatorial vetoes , etc. all of these things severely weakened the system			0
publicly funded candidates could no longer compete against opponents who were backed by big donors and special interest groups			2
this year , only 51 % of candidates in @entity25 are using public funding			1
but @entity104 are fighting like junkyard dogs to take back their elections			0
a citizen - led @entity58 initiative is underway that includes measures to strengthen @entity58 and increase transparency and accountability in campaign finance laws			2
it 's good policy , timely and important			0
hundreds of @entity25 residents have mobilized , working to restore and fully fund the @entity58 law			1
grassroots supporters have collected more than 15,000 signatures to ensure a @entity58 initiative is on the ballot in 2015			2
on @entity13 , nearly 1,000 volunteers will staff polling places across the state to collect the necessary signatures from fellow @entity104 to ensure that they have the opportunity to demand @entity58 from the voting booth next year			2
in many other states , we do n't have the opportunity to voice our frustrations about big money in politics at the ballot box , but we can still send a message to @entity135			1
that 's why i started @entity138			0
it 's a way for anybody , anywhere , anytime to turn his or her money into media by rubber stamping it with messages such as " not to be used for @entity147 " and " @entity148			0
" so long after @entity13 , we can keep ( legally ) decorating our dollars to help build a nationwide , grassroots movement to get big money out of politics			1
that 's what i 'll be doing			0
but our friends in @entity25 will do more			0
i applaud @entity156 and all of the good citizens who will be at the polls , rain or shine , to greet fellow voters on @entity13			0
they wo n't settle for a diminished clean election system -- they 're fighting hard to make it strong			0
their work on the @entity166 is grassroots democracy in action .			2

about a billion dollars will be spent by special interests on midterm elections
@entity173 : we do n't want a government of , by and for fat cats and plutocrats
he says @entity25 's @entity58 system promotes public funding , democracy
