@entity0 -- @entity2 , the only person convicted in connection with the @entity5 airline bombing that killed 259 people on board @entity5 and 11 on the ground , went to his grave protesting his innocence			1
and there are others who believe that @entity2 , who died on sunday from cancer , was not responsible for bringing down the jet over @entity16 in 1988 , including some of the victims ' families			1
why does the tragedy continue to raise questions ? @entity1 examines the issues			0
why was @entity2 convicted ? after a nine - month trial that concluded in january 2001 , a @entity16 court based in a former @entity24 base at @entity25 in the @entity26 , convicted @entity2 of the murders and he was sentenced to life in prison with the condition that he serve at least 27 years before being eligible for parole			1
@entity16 does not have the death penalty			1
the trial followed years of negotiation with @entity36 , after @entity38 and @entity24 investigators indicted two men for the crime in 1991			1
@entity5 bomber dies more than two years after release the @entity24 and @entity38 blamed both @entity2 , who was once security chief for @entity43 , and @entity44 -- accusing them both of being @entity36 intelligence agents			1
@entity36 eventually handed over both men to the @entity48 in 1999 and later paid $ 2.7 billion to victims ' families			1
sanctions against @entity53 's regime were lifted on the same day the men were taken into custody			0
at @entity2 's trial , prosecutors said he placed a bomb in a @entity60 cassette recorder and hid it in suitcase on a flight from @entity63 to @entity64 , @entity65			1
the bag was believed to have been transferred to a @entity68 flight that went first to @entity69 and then to flight 103 to @entity71			0
@entity5 victims ' families : relief , anger the prosecution maintained that @entity2 , who worked at the @entity63 airport , had been seen buying clothes , fragments of which were found in the suitcase that contained the bomb			1
@entity82 was found guilty but @entity44 was acquitted			0
many of the victim 's families believe the right man was convicted and expressed a mixture of relief on hearing of @entity2 's death and anger that he had been released from his sentence			1
@entity93 , whose daughter was among the @entity95 killed , said : " he was a mass murderer			0
" why was he released early ? in august 2009 , eight years after @entity2 's conviction , there was uproar when @entity16 justice secretary @entity101 announced that he would be released from prison on compassionate grounds because he was suffering from terminal prostate cancer			1
his release -- and the celebrations that greeted him on his return to @entity36 -- sparked condemnation from the @entity24 , and from some victims ' families			1
despite being given just a few months to live , he survived for more than two years , sparking anger against the @entity16 authorities and accusations in the @entity38 press that a deal had been struck with @entity36			1
a group of @entity24 senators then attempted to investigate rumors that the @entity5 bomber was released as part of a deal to allow @entity121 to drill for oil off the coast of @entity36			1
on sunday , @entity38 prime minister @entity124 reiterated his belief that @entity2 should never have been released from prison			1
but @entity16 's first minister @entity127 said @entity2 's death put to rest " some of the conspiracy theories which have attempted to suggest that his illness was somehow manufactured			1
" why is @entity2 's guilt questioned ? in an interview with @entity134 in 2011 al @entity2 vowed that " new facts " would come to light			2
he always maintained his innocence			0
after @entity2 lodged an appeal whilst still in prison , the evidence was reviewed by the @entity141			1
new evidence uncovered during the investigation and other evidence not submitted at @entity2 's original trial led the review commission to state that he " may have suffered a miscarriage of justice			2
" the commission said there was no reasonable basis to suspect that @entity2 purchased the clothes in @entity63 on the day alleged			2
it also said evidence that the clothes shop owner had seen @entity2 's picture in a magazine article that linked him to the bombing before picking him out in a lineup was not put to the court			1
the @entity48 observer at the trial , @entity163 , has also called into question the verdict , telling the @entity38 's independent newspaper in 2009 that he believed @entity2 to be innocent			1
" i watched a case unfold that was based on circumstantial evidence			0
the indictment against him and @entity44 went to great lengths to explain how they supposedly planted a bomb on flight 103 , and yet @entity44 was acquitted of all the charges against him			0
it made no sense that @entity2 was guilty when @entity44 was acquitted , " he said			2
@entity179 , whose daughter @entity180 died on the @entity68 flight , has also expressed doubt about @entity2 's guilt and is a member of the justice for @entity186			2
@entity1 's @entity187 , who tracked down @entity2 in @entity36 during the uprising against @entity53 , spoke to his family in august 2011			1
they told him they believed @entity82 was the victim of both international justice and the regime of the ousted @entity36 leader , who they say used him as a scapegoat			2
@entity187 : finding the @entity5 bomber are there other suspects ? @entity187 says about the case : " there are forensic inconsistencies			0
there are so many holes in the evidence			0
there are serious questions that have not been answered			0
" according to my @entity209 source , the @entity209 had an agent inside the cell that operated inside @entity65			0
the agent was the bomb maker			0
he made five bombs to go in transistor radios but informed his handlers that one was missing			0
the @entity219 said ' nonsense , all bombs are accounted for			0
' @entity16 investigators were never able to interview that cell			2
" tv producer and author @entity224 has spent many years studying the case , and worked as a researcher with @entity2 's defense team between 2006 and 2009			1
he believes @entity2 was innocent and presents his reasons in his book " @entity2 : you are my jury - the @entity5 evidence			2
' " he believes that @entity235 is the likely suspect behind the bombing , using the @entity239 group @entity238 ( @entity240 ) to carry out the attack			2
he told @entity1 he believed the group operated from @entity243 but had a cell inside @entity65 , and alleges the attack was in revenge for the accidental shooting down of an @entity235 passenger jet by the @entity95 in july 1988 with the loss of 290 lives			0
missiles from @entity252 hit the plane as it flew over the @entity254			0
in his book he presents what he says is new evidence about the @entity5 bomb 's timing device but says this has been ignored by investigating authorities			0
where is the investigation going next ? on monday , @entity16 's first minister told @entity38 media that the @entity5 case was still a live investigation			1
but new evidence may be hard to find			0
@entity269 , @entity53 's son , who is in custody in @entity36 and wanted by the @entity271 to face charges of alleged crimes against humanity , will have the facts , according to @entity187			2
@entity38 confident @entity36 will allow police probe " he was heading up the campaign to free @entity2 , " he said			1
" he will know whether or not this was a @entity36 operation , accepting the blame for the bombing as the price of admission for doing business -- a way to sell @entity36 oil again			1
" he also suggests that the former head of @entity36 intelligence , @entity289 , currently held in @entity291 , may know more			2
" @entity292 as the head of @entity36 intelligence would perhaps have had broader knowledge behind some of the issues relating to this particular case , " he said			2
but @entity224 remains pessimistic about finding the whole truth			0
" i 'm not confident that we will get evidence that will stand up in court ... leads have gone cold , " he told @entity1			0
" one hope is @entity304			0
if the @entity304 government crumbles then evidence may emerge from there , but i would be surprised			0
" before @entity2 's death , @entity163 told the @entity38 press : " we will probably never really know who caused the @entity5 bombing			1
so much key information was withheld from the trial			0
the @entity38 have yet satisfactorily to explain why			2
" i want to know when the bomb was placed on the plane and by whom			0
i find it very difficult to understand why there seems to be so little pressure from the @entity38 and @entity24 public on their governments to investigate the bombing properly			1
" reporter 's notebook : remembering the @entity5 tragedy			0
