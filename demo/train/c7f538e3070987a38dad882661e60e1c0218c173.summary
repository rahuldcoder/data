-- @entity1 is one for tradition			1
although he and his buddies did n't catch anything at all during a fishing trip last summer , he had so much fun they all decided to do it again this year			0
so last week the @entity8 , @entity9 , native and his four longtime friends set out for an entire day fishing off the coast of @entity14 what a difference a year makes			1
after dropping anchor a few miles off of @entity17 at around 8 a.m. , @entity1 baited his first hook of the day			2
" and then all of the sudden , boom ! " @entity1 told @entity0			2
that boom was a 920 - pound @entity22 tuna on the other end of his line			1
" it dragged us around the ocean for three hours " he said			0
" we had to cut the anchor ! " it took the strength of all of them -- rotating every 15 or 20 minutes -- to reel it in			0
after the 9 - foot - long tuna was taken back to the dock , it was cleaned , stripped of the bones and was sold for $ 4,000			1
it was enough tuna to fill nearly 2,000 of the 5 - ounce cans sold in the grocery store			2
will the gang do it again next summer ? " @entity42 says			0
" in the same spot , on the same day , at the same time , on same boat , with same crew , and i 'm even going to use the same hook "			0
