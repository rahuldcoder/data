stop worrying about the website and start talking about @entity2 's benefits			1
that was president @entity5 's message to the nation on tuesday as he kicked off a three - week public relations blitz intended to generate more participation in his signature health care reforms			1
a day after officials declared the previously dysfunctional @entity12 website working smoothly for most users , @entity5 held a @entity15 event to try to shift the focus of a fiercely partisan public debate to how much help the @entity19 offers @entity20 in need			1
he noted the botched website launch of october 1 set back implementation of the reforms , and encouraged supporters to help him reintroduce the law to a still skeptical nation			1
" our poor execution in the first couple months on the website clouded the fact that there are a whole bunch of people who stand to benefit , " @entity5 said			1
" now that the website 's working for the vast majority of people , we need to make sure that folks refocus on what 's at stake here			2
" the administration hopes the new ability of @entity12 to handle 800,000 users a day or more without major problems signals a major step forward in getting people to sign up for health coverage now required by law under the reforms			2
however , officials including @entity5 , warn that glitches will persist and describe the website as a work in progress			1
in another potential problem disclosed tuesday , a @entity57 inspector general audit cited possible security weaknesses against potential fraud by people getting government subsidies under @entity2 to lower their health insurance costs			1
the @entity64 , which will enforce compliance with the law 's mandate to obtain health coverage , responded that it continues to develop systems to detect and prevent fraud involving subsidies when recipients file their 2014 tax returns			2
meanwhile , insurance companies say some " back - end " aspects of the @entity12 system continued to malfunction			0
in particular , insurers cite problems with applications from people who signed up through the website , including erroneous or missing information			2
@entity15 spokesman @entity84 said tech experts were working on the processing problems , offering assurances they would be fixed in time for enrollment starting on january 1 , 2014			0
" we 're confident that they 'll be able to achieve that , " @entity84 said			0
critics , led by conservative republicans trying to dismantle the health care reforms known as @entity2 , say the website problems foreshadow deeper failings of the law that passed with no @entity93 support			1
" it 's not just a broken website ; this bill is fundamentally flawed , " house speaker @entity102 said tuesday , later adding that " when you look at @entity2 , what you see is a government - centered health care delivery system			1
" @entity20 do n't want that , the @entity114 @entity93 insisted , declaring they instead " want to be able to pick their own type of health insurance , they want to be able to pick their own doctor and they want to be able to pick their own hospital			1
" @entity5 challenged @entity102 and other @entity93 to come up with something better instead of simply opposing and trying to obstruct the implementation of @entity2			1
" we may never satisfy the law 's opponents , " he told an audience of supporters at the @entity15 , including embattled health secretary @entity122 , whose department oversees the reforms			2
the president listed specific benefits , such as an end to lifetime caps on coverage and denial of coverage due to pre-existing conditions			2
because of @entity2 , parents can keep their children on family policies up to age 26 , and people can get free mammograms and other screening			2
now , he said , the 1 million visitors to @entity12 on monday showed the robust public interest in new health insurance exchanges under the reforms			1
" some have already convinced themselves that the law has failed , regardless of the evidence , " @entity5 said , prompting applause when he rejected @entity93 efforts to delay or dismantle the reforms			1
" we 're not repealing it as long as i 'm president , " he said , adding " we 're not going to walk away from it			2
if i 've got to fight another three years to make sure this law works , then that 's what i 'll do			0
" in a blog post on tuesday , the @entity158 announced that more than 1.46 million people have been added to @entity161 and @entity162 rolls due to expanded services under the health care reforms			1
the @entity2 offered states additional federal funding to offer @entity161 and @entity162 coverage to more low - income @entity20			2
so far , 24 states and the @entity170 have accepted the expansion funding while three others are still deciding and 23 have declined			0
more events will occur daily through december 23 , the deadline for people to get coverage that will take effect on january 1			0
a new - found confidence over the weekend , officials announced they had met their self - imposed november 30 deadline for getting the site working for the " vast majority " of users , saying response times and error rates had been slashed while capacity increased			0
@entity187 , a former administration official brought in to oversee the website fixes after its launch , compared the hardware upgrades so far to widening a highway on - ramp from two lanes to four			0
that means chronic breakdowns , error messages and delays users experienced two months ago when the website went live have mostly disappeared , he said , noting the average response time was less than 1 second and the system 's " uptime " -- a measure of system stability -- was consistently surpassing 90 %			0
it all means that @entity12 can now handle its original intended volume of 50,000 concurrent users for a total of 800,000 visitors a day , according to @entity187			0
a new component that put users in a waiting queue during periods of high volume provided a better - managed delay than the site freezes and error messages of october			0
the waiting queue also asked users if they wanted to receive an e-mail notifiying them when they could try again at the front of the line			0
according to an @entity158 official , 13,000 people requested an e-mail and 60 % of them -- roughly 7,800 -- later returned after getting the email notification			0
administration : @entity2 website working smoothly not all roses in the @entity230 vocal throughout the launch of the program and the successive problems , the @entity93 stayed vigilant with its critique			1
" president @entity5 and his administration repeatedly claimed the @entity2 website would be fully functioning by the end of november , but this has proven to be just another broken promise , " @entity236 chairman @entity235 said monday			1
" the @entity5 administration had over three years to build @entity12 , and all they 've produced is a non-functioning website , wasting hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars			1
" obamacare site fix : 5 things to look for insurers : site glitches persist in october , the first month of a six - month enrollment period , just over 106,000 people signed up for @entity2			2
less than 27,000 of them did so through the @entity12 website , which was supposed to be the main enrollment portal			0
an administration official familiar with the matter told @entity255 that about 100,000 people signed up for coverage last month on the site			0
the official cautioned the number was preliminary and final numbers would be released in mid-december			0
@entity262 , a @entity158 spokeswoman , said enrollment through alternate channels and successful exchanges in 14 states would help bolster november figures			0
initial enrollment figures lower than hoped website progress garners muted reaction from @entity271 @entity272 , the official charged with implementing @entity2 as director of the @entity274 , told a congressional hearing last month that the administration initially hoped to enroll 800,000 people by the end of november			1
the overall enrollment target by the march 31 deadline for 2014 is 7 million			0
a properly functioning @entity12 is crucial to implementing the most vital provisions of the health law that require people to have health coverage			0
the coming months will show if it was successful			0
with website deadline met , @entity2 scrutiny increases			1
