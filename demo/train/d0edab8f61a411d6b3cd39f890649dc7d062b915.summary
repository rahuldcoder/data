-- the governor of @entity2 has received about 400 responses on a special website dedicated to answering a generations - old question : should outlaw @entity7 get a pardon in the killing of a sheriff ? gov. @entity12 , called a @entity7 buff , is looking at an old promise by another governor , and not the @entity17 's cold - blooded reputation , in deciding whether to issue a posthumous pardon , officials said			1
" i think he will take the responses into account , particularly the learned responses , " @entity12 's deputy chief of staff , @entity19 , said wednesday			1
so far , about 220 people are in favor of the pardon , while 180 are against , @entity19 said			2
those interested have until december 26 to belly up to the bar and weigh in			0
the governor , who is also reviewing the historical record , has said he will announce a decision after @entity32 but by december 31 , when his term ends			0
@entity7 , born @entity7 , also known as @entity7 and @entity7 , died at the hands of another sheriff , @entity35 , when he was only 21			1
some members of the @entity35 family , including grandson @entity38 ( @entity38 ) @entity35 , oppose the pardon			0
besides arguing that @entity7 was an incorrigible killer , they want to make sure @entity35 is absolved of any wrongdoing related to the killing and a @entity7 jail escape			1
but @entity19 said the governor will not do anything that casts a cloud on @entity35			0
" we consider @entity35 a true hero of the @entity48			0
" @entity50 defense attorney @entity49 , who volunteered to handle the case for free , filed the petition for the pardon			0
" a promise is a promise and should be enforced , " she wrote			0
@entity35 killed @entity7 on july 14 , 1881 , in @entity55 weeks after @entity7 escaped from a jail			1
the sheriff , legend has it , was hiding in the dark and shot the kid when he entered a room			0
@entity35 himself was gunned down in 1908 at age 57			0
@entity12 will be deciding only the matter of a promise to @entity7 made by territorial gov. @entity67 , @entity19 said			1
" we 're not offering a blanket pardon for everything he did			0
" @entity67 -- who had also been a @entity72 general in the @entity73 and wrote the novel " @entity74 " -- had promised to grant @entity7 amnesty for the fatal shooting of @entity78 sheriff @entity77 and other " misdeeds " if he agreed to testify before a grand jury investigating another murder			1
@entity7 cooperated , but the pardon did n't happen			1
according to @entity83 and other historians , @entity7 at one point wrote to @entity67 , asking him to honor the deal			2
the @entity87 argue @entity7 decided to flee house arrest , making the pardon moot			2
he eventually was convicted in @entity77 's death and was sentenced to death , the petition states			1
but he escaped from jail on april 28 , 1881 , killing two deputies			0
" still , regardless of @entity7 's crimes , the motives of @entity12 or the hollowness of posthumous justice , it all comes back to @entity67 's promise			1
a deal is a deal , and 129 years does n't change that			0
@entity7 is owed a pardon , " @entity83 wrote earlier this year in the @entity103			1
the @entity87 do n't buy that argument			0
" if @entity7 was living amongst us now , would you issue a pardon for someone who made his living as a thief and , more egregiously , who killed four law enforcement officers and numerous others ? " the @entity35 family wrote @entity12 last fall			1
@entity115 told @entity0 wednesday that there is no written proof that @entity67 made the promise and that the charges were federal , which did not give the governor the right to make the offer			1
but @entity123 said a written promise is not necessary and there is ample evidence and letters indicating it was made			2
and , she said , @entity7 was convicted of state charges after federal ones were dismissed			2
@entity123 also rebuffed @entity35 's questions about her independence because her husband was appointed state chief justice by @entity12			1
chief justice @entity137 is not involved in the matter , she said , adding , " i am not an appendage of my husband			0
" popular history has @entity7 gunning down 21 men , but many historians say the number was closer to nine			2
according to other legends , @entity7 did not die at @entity35 's hands and is not buried in @entity55 , @entity2			1
he went to @entity148 and became known as " @entity149 , they say			0
poppycock , the @entity87 argue			0
they asked @entity12 to sign a petition signed by 100 people that reads , " whereas we the undersigned accept and agree the traditional history of sheriff @entity35 and @entity7 ( @entity7 ) , and believe that @entity7 died at @entity35 's hand ; therefore we oppose a postphumous ( sic ) pardon for @entity7 as @entity155			1
" but @entity123 said @entity7 kept his bargain by testifying and should receive the pardon			2
the attorney said at least two killings attributed to @entity7 were self - defense and five others could have been done by others			2
evidence shows that " it 's ambiguous here who were the bad guys and who were the good guys			0
" " governor @entity67 did not keep his end of the deal , which was to pardon mr. @entity7 for all outstanding charges , including the pending indictment related to the death of sheriff @entity77 , " @entity123 wrote last week			1
" this injustice should be corrected			0
" " why would he [ @entity7 ] surrender himself ... unless there was something in it for him ? " @entity123 asked wednesday .			2
