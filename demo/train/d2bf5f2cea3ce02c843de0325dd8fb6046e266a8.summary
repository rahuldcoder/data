the economy has been front and center during this presidential race , followed by issues such as national security , abortion and taxes			2
but are the candidates talking enough about the @entity8 ? some big - time @entity10 players do n't think so and plan to launch a nationwide bus tour to see if they can change that			0
start - up guru @entity13 , co-founder of social sharing site @entity15 , is raising funds for the @entity17			1
" from taxes , to health care , to immigration -- democrats and @entity26 ca n't seem to agree on anything , " reads the text on the project 's @entity23 fund - raising campaign			1
" but there 's one thing no one 's really talking about that both sides should be championing : the @entity32			0
" @entity13 , who also founded travel site @entity33 and philanthropic geek - merchandise vendor @entity35 , was active in this year 's fight to derail the @entity38			1
that bill and related legislation were designed to crack down on illegal sharing of copyrighted material , but critics attacked it as an overreaching assault on web freedoms			1
@entity13 said that the success of @entity15 , which was launched in 2005 with just $ 12,000 in funding , speaks to the importance of a free and open @entity8 to the economic growth both parties promise to deliver			1
the site was bought by @entity52 in 2006 and , last month , had nearly 40 million unique visitors			0
" we got to live the @entity59 dream by having this great startup success at a company that continues to grow , " he said in an interview with @entity56			0
" there is really no other industry right now where you can say that			0
" there are companies right now , starting up all over the country , who could be the next @entity70			0
" tour leaders have drafted what they 're calling the @entity73			0
it calls for promises to never censor the @entity10 , promote international access to fast , affordable web services and defend online privacy , among other things			1
and they 're encouraging both major @entity59 political parties to add internet freedom to their official platforms			1
@entity13 said he 's heard " on pretty damn good authority " that some sort of web - freedom language will be proposed for the @entity26 platform			1
he hopes that will help spur @entity89 , many of whom also opposed sopa and similar bills , to do the same			0
" i would love to hear it brought up during the debates , " he said			0
" i would love it to be the thing that @entity97 and @entity98 try to one - up each other on			0
" the bus ( painted half - red and half - blue to give it a bipartisan vibe ) will travel from @entity103 -- site of the first presidential debate october 3 -- to @entity106 , @entity107 , where the vice-presidential debate will be held eight days later			2
it will start with a kickoff event on october 1 in @entity103			0
along the roughly 1,000 - mile journey , they plan to host meet - ups with supporters , promote local web start - ups , support candidates friendly to their cause and register people to vote			1
@entity15 is funding most of the cost of getting the tour from town to town , but the fund - raising campaign will cover expenses such as hosting local events , promotional material and documenting the journey			1
the campaign is shooting to raise $ 40,000			0
unlike fellow fund - raising site @entity129 though , @entity23 does n't require that goal to be reached for the tour to receive all the contributions			0
it wo n't be the first time that folks from @entity15 ( current general manager @entity136 is joining @entity13 ) have sparred with presidential campaign players over web freedom			1
the site targeted @entity26 vice-presidential candidate @entity140 last year for his perceived support of the @entity38			1
critics considered @entity140 , chairman of the @entity143 , to have been too vague in his stance on the legislation and objected to the $ 288,600 in campaign funds he had received from groups considered to be for it			2
@entity15 users launched " @entity154 , " publicizing the congressman 's muted stance on the issue and throwing support behind his political opponent			2
@entity140 eventually announced he would oppose the bill , calling the @entity8 " one of the most magnificent expressions of freedom and free enterprise in history " and saying " it should stay that way			1
" " a bunch of random people on the @entity8 made it an issue , " @entity13 said			2
" a bunch of citizens got him and his team to come out with a statement in opposition			0
" @entity15 also joined @entity172 and other sites that went black for a day in january to protest that legislation , which was eventually shelved without a vote .			2
