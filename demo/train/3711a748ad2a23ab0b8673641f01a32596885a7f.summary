-- more than 100 million people are expected to tune in to @entity2 this weekend , but only some of them are football fans			0
thanks to pregame hype and @entity9 - quality production values , @entity5 commercials have become the main attraction for many viewers			1
but are these blockbuster ads bad for our waistlines ? food and beverage companies are expected to account for roughly one - third of the ads that will air during sunday 's game , according to @entity19			1
( car companies will take up another one - third or so , with the remainder split among websites , film studios , and retail chains			0
) viewers and partygoers -- including millions of children -- can expect to see ads from @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 , snickers , and @entity33			2
@entity0 : 25 diet - busting foods you should never eat in other words , a high proportion of ads are pitching soda , snacks , and other junk foods loaded with calories , sugar , sodium , and fat			1
" studies show [ that ] if you see an ad for a product and try it for the first time , you like it more than if you did n't see the ad , " says @entity46 , @entity47 , the director of marketing initiatives at @entity50 's @entity49 , in @entity51			2
" it really is shaping our preferences as well as triggering us to eat more			0
" yes , advertising works humor , suspense , and sexy people digging into supersize bags of @entity29 have become a staple of @entity5 commercials			1
it 's the oldest trick in the book : make a product or brand attractive and appealing by surrounding it with attractive and appealing stuff			2
it 's tempting to believe that this strategy wo n't work on you			2
in the real world , nearly everyone recognizes that people who consume a lot of soda , junk food , and beer are often overweight and unhealthy -- not exactly what 's depicted on - screen			1
and yet we give in to the ploy			0
@entity0 : 11 healthy @entity5 snacks " we know the effects of excessive snacks are quite adverse to people 's health			1
if you drink a lot of beer , you are n't going to get all the attractive women , " says @entity92 , @entity47 , an economist and professor of health services at the @entity95			0
" that may seem obvious , but those images work on us on a subconscious level			0
" @entity92 believes the true culprit behind the obesity epidemic is n't high - fructose corn syrup , sodium , or saturated fat , per se , but rather the ubiquitous marketing that makes foods containing those ingredients appealing to @entity111			1
in his research on the health effects of television on children ( and more recently adults ) , @entity92 found that the number of commercials people see is more closely linked to the risk of being overweight or obese than the total time they spend watching tv			1
@entity0 : how junk foods are marketed to kids and the subconscious impact of @entity5 ads might be even greater than that of everyday commercials , because the ads are part of the entertainment , @entity126 says			1
" if you see a commercial trying to give you information , you know exactly what it 's doing , " she says			2
" but if you 're just being entertained , you 're not looking at it in that same way , which is probably what makes it more effective			0
" the power of advertising has largely had a negative effect on our health , but in theory that power could be harnessed for good , says @entity152 , @entity153 , who has seen the fallout from the obesity epidemic firsthand as the director of cardiac and pulmonary rehabilitation at @entity160 's @entity159			2
" we 're led to the watering hole -- or really to the burger and the beer , " @entity152 says			0
" if fruit companies and tap water companies were advertising , we 'd be going in that direction instead			0
" can commercials make you hungry ? research suggests that tv commercials can prompt you to eat			1
advertising triggers an " automatic eating response " that can make you eat more of " basically any food that 's in front of you , " @entity126 says			1
@entity0 : how the pros curb food cravings http://www.health.com/health/gallery/0,,20394811,00.html this effect was demonstrated during an experiment that @entity126 and her colleagues at the @entity49 conducted in 2009			0
the researchers randomly divided 98 young adults into three groups and showed each group an episode of the tv show @entity188 ? the participants were told that the study was about the effect of tv on mood			2
the episodes the groups watched were identical -- except for the commercial breaks			0
one version contained ads for junk foods ( such as candy , soda , and fast food ) that emphasized " fun and excitement , " another version had ads for nutritious foods ( such as oatmeal and @entity207 ) , and a third version contained no food advertising at all			1
( all three versions had some nonfood commercials as well			2
) after watching the show , the study participants were moved to another room , where they were told that they could eat as much as they wanted from an array of snack foods , ranging from healthy ( vegetables and dip ) to not so healthy ( cookies )			0
the participants who saw the unhealthy snack commercials ate the most food -- even if they reported not feeling hungry			1
the volunteers in experiments like these generally do n't think that advertising can affect their behavior in this way , @entity126 says			0
" most people believe they have more control over everything than they actually do , " she says			0
" once people know they are influenced , then they 're better able to control behaviors			0
" commercials and parties : a dangerous combo ? @entity5 partygoers probably wo n't have to go far to fulfill their cravings for the soda , chips , and other foods that they see in high definition			1
there appears to be a certain synergy between @entity5 ads and the menu at most @entity5 parties			1
@entity0 : the ultimate tv party a 2001 study in the @entity254 that analyzed the " likability " of every @entity5 ad that aired in the 1990s found that viewers consistently ranked ads from " party - food marketers " -- including @entity260 , @entity31 , and @entity261 -- high on the likability scale			1
by contrast , ads for " party - busting products " such as over-the - counter medications were far less popular with viewers			0
" consumers are sending a clear message that certain products interest them more than others during @entity5 broadcasts , " the authors concluded			1
" it is a good strategy to continue to advertise food and beverage products extensively during the @entity5 because consumption peaks during the game			1
" indeed , @entity111 are said to consume more food on @entity5 sunday than on any day of the year except @entity279			2
according to @entity152 , that 's not such a good thing			0
" a little bit of soda is okay , a hot dog is okay , " he says , but he adds that even just one day of excessive drinking or gorging on chips and soda is enough to do real harm			0
( some studies suggest that a big meal can even trigger a heart attack			0
) @entity5 may trigger heart attacks the larger problem , @entity152 says , is that the dynamic on @entity296 is n't all that unusual			2
the relationship between tv commercials and unhealthy eating may be more pronounced on the biggest football day of the year , but it 's simply an exaggerated version of what has become a part of everyday life			1
" the foods that are eaten are a reflection of what people are doing throughout the year , not an isolated event , " @entity152 says			0

a high proportion of ads are pitching soda , snacks , and other junk foods
there 's a certain synergy between @entity5 ads and the menu at most parties
the relationship between tv commercials and unhealthy eating may be more pronounced
