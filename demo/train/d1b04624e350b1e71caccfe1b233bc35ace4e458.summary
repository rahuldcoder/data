" it was my first match here in these circumstances			0

" his affable demeanor contrasted sharply with world number one @entity26 , who had made tough work of beating @entity30 qualifier @entity31 6 - 2 3 - 6 6 - 2 on tuesday			1
@entity26 had plenty to say about the blue clay after a minor scare on his first competitive outing on the new surface			1

" it 's impossible to move , " he was quoted as telling reporters by @entity48			0
" i hit maybe five balls , the rest went just trying to put the ball into the court			0
" i was relying on serve and getting free points from his unforced errors			0
that was not tennis , either i need football shoes or some advice on how to play on this court			0
" i can not find the words to describe this court			0
it 's really tough to play like this on a center court			0
we need serious discussion about the future of this blue clay			1
" we can not change anything this year , but my first impressions are not good			0
i do n't want to be the one complaining , but i say honestly what i feel			0
" world no. 3 @entity74 survived a big scare against rising star @entity77 in wednesday 's late match , finally triumphing 4 - 6 7 - 5 7 - 6 ( 7 - 4 ) after more than two hours on court			1
" i had a tough first set and one bad game that cost me the set really , " said @entity74 , who won the event on hard court in 2006 and then in its first year on clay in 2009			2
" he could swing big on my service games and i could n't do that much on his , but i was getting more balls back as the match went on			0
i played a good tie - breaker overall			0
" @entity74 , playing his first match in five weeks following a third - round exit in @entity92 , will next play @entity95 14th seed @entity93			1
" it was pretty much a big struggle for me tonight but the level is pretty good and i 'm happy where i am in the season , " the 16 - time grand slam champion said			2
it was a big disappointment for world @entity102 , who dominated for large spells of the match with his booming serve and powerful groundstrokes			2
" i felt like i was on top throughout the whole match , " @entity77 said			2
" i will probably be more happy with the whole outcome in a few days but now is not the right time			0
" in the women 's draw in @entity3 , @entity110 champion @entity109 booked her quarterfinal place by beating @entity114 of @entity115 7 - 5 6 - 4			1
@entity109 broke the the @entity115 number two on three occasions as she continued her fine form on clay after reaching the quarterfinals of the @entity121 last month			2

@entity128 champion @entity127 of @entity129 also reached the last eight with a 6 - 3 6 - 2 win over @entity133 @entity132			1
@entity136 fourth seed @entity134 ended the 16 - match clay court winning streak of @entity139 's @entity138 in spectacular fashion with a 6 - 0 6 - 1 rout in their second - round match .			1

@entity1 sweeps aside @entity5 's @entity4 6 - 2 6 - 2 at the @entity3
second - ranked @entity1 shows no *weakness* on @entity3 's new blue clay
