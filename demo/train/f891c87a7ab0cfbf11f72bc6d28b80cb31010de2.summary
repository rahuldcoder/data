-- is @entity1 trying to get @entity3 users to book higher - priced hotels ? the travel website 's ceo says that 's not exactly the case			1
but that 's how many @entity3 users are feeling after the @entity11 reported tuesday that @entity1 was steering @entity3 users toward higher - priced hotels than pc users , based on spending habits discovered by one of the site 's algorithms			1
ceo @entity18 told @entity0 that @entity1 recommendation results are part of an attempt to pair customers with the hotel they 'd probably pick			2
in this case , @entity1 will offer recommendations based on what other pc or other @entity3 users selected as their final hotel , on the assumption that spending habits are the same , he said			1
" what we have found is ... that @entity3 users are 40 % more likely to book four - or five - star hotels than pc users , " @entity18 said			1
" that lines up with ( the fact that ) @entity3 users are typically more willing to spend more money on higher - end computers			2
" in the @entity11 story , @entity1 engineers said they were experimenting with predictive analytics based on users ' computers , which resulted in @entity3 users being served up a different set of results -- often with a bigger price tag			1
and boy , did that anger some @entity3 users			2
once the @entity11 story hit , many people took to @entity51 in a fury , saying that just because they shelled out money for a macbook does n't mean they do n't want a good deal on a hotel			2
others argued that buying a pricier computer would leave them less money for a vacation and make them more inclined to seek travel deals			0
they argued that what @entity1 is doing is unfair and that it is forcing @entity3 users to take longer or dig deeper for a deal			1
meanwhile , rival travel sites @entity65 , @entity66 and @entity67 capitalized on the furor to insist that they do n't use similar algorithms based on what type of computer their customers employ			0
@entity3 vs. pc : the stereotypes may be true online marketers have long culled information about users in order to better target ads. and studies show that consumers are indeed targeted in different ways based on their devices			0
you may see different promoted products on many sites depending on whether you 're using a mobile app or a desktop			0
marketing analysts , reacting to the @entity1 story , say the thinking is that if you 're willing to shell out extra money for an @entity93 or @entity54 , you may have more disposable income			0
they believe that @entity1 may be trying to skew their results for @entity3 users based on this perception			1
@entity1 , on the other hand , says it 's trying to provide @entity3 users with the best hotel recommendations based on what other @entity3 users are choosing			1
@entity1 data show that @entity3 users are likely to spend $ 20 more a night on a hotel than pc users , on average , @entity18 said			1
@entity18 said his company is in no way charging @entity3 users more for the same hotel as pc users			2
" that would be absolute nonsense , " he told @entity0			0
@entity18 said customers can always ignore the recommended options and search specifically by price			0
" our goal though is to use technology to learn from the millions who search our website every day , every week , every month , to make the consumer experience better			0
we are really excited about the potential to use this wisdom ... to make travel better for consumers , " he said			0
" this is just one of myriad examples of how we 're making the site more customized			0
