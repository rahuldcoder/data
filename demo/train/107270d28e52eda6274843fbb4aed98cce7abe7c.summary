-- are @entity2 and country music never , ever , ever getting back together ? @entity2 released a video monday for her new single , " @entity3 , " and the song is decidedly more pop than fans are used to from the country singer			1
it 's all in keeping with her fifth studio album , " 1989 , " which @entity2 announced during a @entity15 livestream			1
the new album 's title is a nod to the year @entity2 was born and is being hyped as the star 's " first documented official pop album			1
" @entity2 sports multiple personas in the music video , including one that is reminiscent of @entity25			1
the song is an ode to the " haters " that @entity2 is shaking off -- and , of course , there is the dancing			1
" all i think about are metaphors and cats , " @entity2 said in the livestream			1
" life itself and who people actually are can be greatly reflected in how people dance			0
... i do n't mean how good you are but your willingness to dance			0
" writing for @entity44 , @entity43 said @entity2 's message seems to be " hate me all you want ... but you 're missing all the fun			2
" " lyrically , ' shake it off ' is ' mean 2.0 , ' with the 24 - year - old singer / songwriter taking all the criticisms leveled at her and dismissing them flippantly , " @entity43 writes			0
" it 's a total swerve musically , however , with horn - blast grooves grounded in early ' 60s proto - soul and girl - group pop , plus a spoken - word breakdown that would come off as awkward if it were n't so knowingly funny			0
" @entity57 immediately embraced the tune , including some high - profile fans			0
talk show host @entity60 tweeted , " do n't mess with @ @entity62 , or she will write an incredibly catchy song about you			0
" @entity66 @entity65 wrote , " okay @entity2 's new song / video " shake it off " is pretty much my favorite thing right now ! she 's hilarious ! @entity71 done # thissickbeat : ) " but not everyone loved the video			2
it inspired some accusations of racism on @entity57			2
" a number of @entity57 users , including rapper @entity82 , have accused @entity2 of perpetuating black stereotypes , " @entity79 writer @entity78 reported			2
" many have pointed out that while all of the graceful ballerinas in the video appear to be white , most of the twerking close - ups feature black dancers ( there are white women twerking as well )			0
" @entity2 's album will be released october 27			1
the single is currently available on @entity96 .			0
