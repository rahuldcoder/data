-- as an @entity4 socialite and hotel heiress , @entity1 has built up a global brand on her sexy image -- and sometimes very few clothes			1
but many believe she has gone a step too far in opening a store selling luxury items in the @entity12 of @entity13 in @entity14			1
@entity16 's rise to worldwide fame was boosted in part by a homemade sex movie that went viral online in 2003 , days before the debut of her reality tv series " @entity24			1
" this does not sit well with many in @entity13 , which attracts three million @entity28 pilgrims from around the world every year			2
all @entity28 who are able are expected to make the pilgrimage to @entity13 at least once in their lifetime , and non-muslims are not allowed to enter the city			1
most @entity14 women cover themselves fully with a black abaya			0
@entity16 introduced her store on the social media site @entity39 , when she wrote , " loving my beautiful new store that just opened at @entity43 in @entity14 ! " accompanying the post with a picture			1
she later added : " this is the 5th store in @entity14 , and store number 42 in total ! so proud to keep growing my brand ! " it is not the store itself that is out of place in @entity13 -- the presence of @entity54 luxury brands is nothing new in @entity14			1
@entity16 's store sells luxury handbags and accessories and is in the new @entity59 , which opened in 2011 with 255 shops , many of them global chains , selling everything from jewelery to electronics , women 's fashion to sportswear			1
it even has a branch of the lingerie chain @entity70			0
also on inside the @entity71 : new wealth brings luxury shopping to @entity74 @entity1 has 42 stores worldwide selling handbags , accessories , shoes , fragrances , watches and t - shirts , and already has four in @entity14			0
however , the combination of @entity16 's personal image with the holiest city in the @entity28 world has riled some in the conservative kingdom			1
sheikh @entity88 , a conservative cleric who preaches in @entity13 , said : '' it is unnecessary to have her shop here because we do not need it			2
'' if it was in our hands we would have closed all of her shops in @entity14			0
'' for others , the outrage was more about the ongoing commercialization of the heritage of @entity13 than @entity16 herself			2
@entity105 , who writes the blogs @entity107 and @entity108 , said : " some people were angry about it and others saw the humor in it			0
" in the end , it 's made a lot of people think about the bigger issue of the commercialization of @entity13 where historic sites have been demolished to make way for modern malls and international brands			1
" there 's no particular reason to be outraged about @entity1 when we already have @entity126 and @entity127			0
but for many it 's further evidence of how the character of @entity13 is being lost			2
" he added : " it 's the combination of the location of the store , who @entity1 is and what she stands for			0
" others on @entity39 expressed similar concerns			0
@entity139 , a @entity14 host on @entity140 wrote : " huge outrage on @entity1 shop in @entity43 ! with or against ? or , do n't care ? personally i am against the ( @entity144 ) of @entity13			2
'' @entity145 , a @entity146 writer based in @entity147 , tweeted : '' @entity148 ( the dominant branch of @entity150 in @entity14 ) at work ! historic religious sites in @entity153 are being destroyed , while @entity1 opens a new store in @entity13 mall			1
'' a @entity14 nursing student @entity156 wrote : '' @entity1 's new store in ( @entity13 )			1
@entity158 being torn apart whilst @entity14 makes way for atrocities like this ! '' while some , like @entity162 - based @entity14 entrepreneur and founder of switch restaurant @entity164 , are more pragmatic			0
he said : " @entity14 is a fair - trade market , where many investors from around the world come to invest and trade			0
i think it was a smart move from the local partners in expanding to ( @entity13 ) considering it ( is ) one of the prime locations and hubs in the kingdom 's retail industry			2
" the other four branches of the store in the country indicate acceptance from the people and the fifth store is simply catering to their demands			0
" @entity0 's calls to the @entity186 headquarters in the @entity4 were not returned .			0
