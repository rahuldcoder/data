-- @entity1 produced the performance of his life to win the masters on sunday and finally exorcise the demons of last year 's @entity6			1
@entity1 , the first @entity7 to ever wear the famous green jacket , defeated @entity10 's @entity9 on the second hole of the playoff after both men finished at nine - under on an enthralling day at @entity14			1
as @entity1 sank the winning putt on the 10th at @entity14 he banished the pain and heartache that had haunted him following his humiliating collapse at @entity20 in july			1
@entity1 's collapse on that occasion , the 32 - year - old looked set to win his first major until he somehow contrived to blow a four - shot lead with just four holes remaining			1
but with the eyes of the sporting world upon him , @entity1 showed nerves of steel to hole his putt and finally end @entity7 's @entity14 curse			1
" i do n't know how that happened , " @entity1 said after his historic triumph			1
" it seems a long , long way from a couple years ago , or last july when i was trying to win a major			2
" @entity1 's character and determination came to the fore at a course where his country 's most famous golfer suffered so mercilessly			1
@entity43 , the man who squandered a six shot lead on the final day at the @entity45 , was the closest @entity7 had come to a @entity46 champion			1
@entity43 lost out to @entity14 native @entity47 in a playoff in 1987 , just a year after his bogey at the 18th allowed @entity51 to win his 18th and final major			1
the tale of @entity54 : @entity14 reaction two years ago , @entity1 and @entity56 finished tied for second as @entity58 produced an astonishing final four holes to win the tournament			1
but this time , @entity1 got the job done , and the @entity63 - born player was quick to praise the man who had come so close at @entity14 in years gone by			1
" it 's incredible to be in this position , " said @entity1 , who had earlier shot a three - under 69 for the final round			1
" @entity7 's a proud sporting nation , and it 's amazing that it 's come down to me today			1
" there was one guy who inspired a nation of golfers , and that 's @entity43			2
part of this definitely belongs to him			0
" he later added : " a phone call is n't going to be enough ; i 'd like to share a beer with him			2
" taking the green jacket from last year 's winner , @entity79 , @entity1 stood proudly after an afternoon that neither he nor @entity7 will ever forget			1
his birdie on the 18th , the 72nd hole of the weekend , produced a hugely emotional celebration , with @entity1 appearing to believe had finally won a major			1
@entity9 , @entity85 lead masters but while he walked back to the clubhouse , 2009 champion @entity9 produced an exquisite shot to ensure a relatively simple putt and the opportunity of a second @entity46 title			1
the playoff provided an exhilarating climax to a round played amidst worsening conditions with the rain constantly falling and the light deteriorating			2
after both making par on the first playoff hole at the 18th , the pair moved to the 10th			2
while @entity9 failed to make a birdie , @entity1 made no such mistake as he holed from 15 feet to spark delirium			1
@entity9 would have been the second oldest man to have won the tournament at the age of 43 , with only @entity51 , who won at the age of 46 in 1986 , ahead of him			1
it would have been some achievement for the @entity10 , currently ranked 269th in the world			2
" that 's how golf is , " said @entity9 , who hit a final round 70			1
i had my chance to win it			2
@entity1 is truly a good winner			2
" he 's a great person and a great player , and i 'm happy for him			2
" @entity7 's @entity56 was one of the first to congratulate @entity1 after he missed out on qualifying for the playoff , eventually finishing two shots back on seven - under for the tournament			1
" it was really tough , " @entity56 said			0
" the pressure got to me a little bit			0
" @entity121 penalized two strokes while @entity1 celebrated , world no. 1 @entity121 refused to blame his two - shot penalty for taking an incorrect drop during his second round friday			1
woods finished with a final round of 70 to finish four shots off the lead -- but the @entity131 star refrained from blaming friday 's incident			2
" we could do that ' what if ? ' in every tournament we lose , " he said			0
" we lose more tournaments than we win out here on tour , so that 's just part of the process , and i 'll go back to it			2
" i thought 65 would win it outright today			0
i thought that was going to be the number , and it looks like it was			0
if i would have shot my number , it might have been a different story			0
" i had a tough time getting accustomed to the speed of the greens ; they were so much slower than yesterday			0
i left every putt short on the first eight holes			0
" i played well but unfortunately did not make enough putts and missed a few shots here and there			0
i had an opportunity today			0
" @entity160 blames ' stupid mistakes ' for slump world no. 2 @entity160 carded a closing 69 to finish the week at two over par , but the @entity166 was satisfied with his game despite failing to challenge the leaders			0
" i know i 've played good enough golf here to win ; it 's just a matter of stringing it all together , " @entity160 said			2
" i was in a good position and did not quite have it all yesterday , and that really cost me			0
" you have to be right on your game for 72 holes here			0
i played a five hole stretch in five over , and that was really it			0
i played nicely again today ; if i just limit the mistakes from yesterday , i am right there			0
sometimes you hit a good shot and all of a sudden it 's off the green ; it is what it is , and you have to embrace it			0
" it 's @entity14 , and you 're going to get some good bounces ; you 're going to get some bad			1
it will all even out in the end			0
" teen sensation @entity193 makes masters cut earlier sunday , @entity196 's 14 - year - old sensation @entity193 finished his momentous week with a three - over 75 to leave him 12 - over for the tournament			1
@entity193 , the youngest ever player to make the cut , received the @entity199 after finishing as the leading amateur			0
" it 's not easy to play here and make the cut and be the low amateur , and i think i did a pretty good job , " @entity193 said			0
" i 'm a little bit tired today			0
there are still a lot of things to improve			0
my short game is good , but i could still get better , and my driving has to get a little bit longer			0
yes , everything needs to improve			0
" rapping golfers return with @entity214 defending champion @entity79 endured a nightmare final round , dunking his ball into the water on three separate occasions at @entity219			0
@entity79 hit a seven - over 10 on the 12th , @entity14 's shortest hole at just 155 yards			1
" if you 're not going to win , you 've got to get in the record books somehow , " @entity79 said after carding a final round 77 , seven - over for the tournament			1
" so i 'm a guy that got a double - digit score on a par three			0
