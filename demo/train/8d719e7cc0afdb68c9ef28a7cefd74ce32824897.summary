-- for the second time in five months , a @entity2 soldier from a @entity4 military base is accused of committing atrocities against civilians in @entity7			1
the unidentified soldier , an @entity9 staff sergeant , is accused of firing on civilians , killing 16 , in a house - to - house shooting rampage in two villages on sunday , according to officials from @entity15 's @entity14			1
shooting could affect @entity2 military mission he had been stationed at @entity19 , a sprawling military installation between @entity21 and @entity22 , @entity4			1
a handful of soldiers from the base have been involved in violent incidents in the past few years , including four soldiers convicted of killing @entity7 civilians in 2010 as part of a " kill squad			1
" also in 2010 , three other soldiers " suffered dangerous public mental breakdowns " after returning from @entity7 , with two of them shot to death by police , according to the @entity37 military newspaper			1
this year , a former soldier from the base is believed to have shot a @entity4 park ranger to death on @entity42			2
twelve soldiers on the base committed suicide in 2010 , according to the base 's @entity47 newspaper			1
last month , @entity9 officials said the forensic psychiatric review process at the base 's @entity51 was itself being reviewed			2
" this was not just a rogue soldier , " said @entity53 , executive director of @entity54 , a veteran - run nonprofit organization that operates a soldiers ' resource center near the base called @entity58			1
the base is " a rogue base , with a severe leadership problem , " he said			1
" if @entity64 was a college campus , it would have been closed down years ago , " @entity53 said			0
in the wake of sunday 's shootings , he called for a congressional investigation and hearings " into the multiple crises " at the base			2
@entity72 vow revenge for shooting rampage others have expressed alarm as well			0
in december 2010 , the @entity37 military newspaper said the facility had gained a reputation as " the most troubled base in the military			1
" it also reported that year that multiple investigations were under way into the conduct of troops at the base and the adequacy of the mental health and medical care soldiers were receiving upon their return home			1
attempts to contact the base 's public affairs office were not immediately successful monday			2
in january , the body of @entity96 , 24 , was found face - down in a creek in @entity4 's @entity96 after a manhunt			0
@entity100 , who was assigned to @entity19 before his 2009 discharge , is believed to have fatally shot park ranger @entity102 on @entity42			1
police said @entity100 was also wanted in connection with a shooting during a fight at a party in a @entity109 suburb			0
that shooting took place before @entity113 's death			0
while investigators said they had little insight into @entity100 ' mindset or motive , the woman with whom he was in a custody dispute said in court documents filed last year she was frightened to be in the same state with him			0
she wrote in other documents , reported by @entity0 affiliate @entity125 , that @entity100 might have been suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder after a deployment to @entity128			0
in november , @entity9 staff sgt. @entity129 , also assigned to the base , was sentenced to life in military prison after a court - martial convicted him of murdering three @entity7 civilians , cutting off pieces of their corpses to keep as " souvenirs " and planting weapons on the bodies to make the men appear to be @entity72 fighters killed in battle			1
@entity129 , who will be eligible for parole in 10 years , was the highest - ranking of five soldiers charged with being part of a rogue " kill squad " targeting civilians in 2010			1
another seven were charged with lesser crimes , including abusing drugs , keeping " off the books " weapons and intimidating a fellow soldier against speaking out against the killings			0
murder and assault charges against one of those five soldiers were dropped last month , according to the @entity161 newspaper			2
@entity129 led the @entity162 of the @entity9 's 5th @entity163 in @entity7 's kandahar province			1
the platoon was tasked with patrolling small villages in the area to build relationships with @entity7 , who were wary of the @entity2 presence in their country			1
instead , prosecutors said , @entity129 and a small group of rogue soldiers plotted to murder civilians			1
" the plan was to kill people , " @entity9 spc. @entity175 , who was among those charged in the deaths , said in court in march 2011 after his guilty plea			0
" there was a group of soldiers in the @entity193 numbering in the single digits who did not behave with honor , " col. @entity184 of the @entity185 , @entity186 , who supervised the courts - martial , said last month in his first public remarks about the case , according to the @entity161			1
" justice was served in a timely manner			0
we should not make the mistake of assuming those soldiers represent all soldiers			2
" the @entity193 has been renamed the @entity185 , according to the @entity161			0
last month , two doctors at @entity51 were removed from clinical duties and assigned to administrative work , the @entity204 newspaper reported , citing @entity209 officials			0
@entity2 sen. @entity210 told the @entity204 that the two included dr. @entity212 , a retired @entity9 officer who leads a forensic psychiatric team responsible for assessing the post-traumatic stress disorder diagnoses of soldiers under consideration for medical retirement			2
@entity209 told the @entity204 it has " initiated a top - to - bottom review of the process associated with the forensic psychiatric reviews conducted at @entity51			0
" a diagnosis of @entity222 qualifies a soldier for medical retirement and benefits			0
the investigation was triggered in part by concerns that @entity230 doctors involved in the screening process were " unduly influenced by worries about the escalating costs of paying benefits , " the @entity204 reported last week			2
complaints from soldiers previously diagnosed with @entity222 but later accused of exaggerating their symptoms also prompted the probe , according to the newspaper			2
some 285 soldiers who were evaluated at @entity230 since 2007 will be asked to undergo a second evaluation , @entity241 , which oversees the medical center , said in a statement last week			0
@entity19 was formed in 2010 by the merger of @entity64 , an @entity9 post , and @entity248			1
at 415,000 acres , it is the largest on the @entity2 @entity250 , according to its website , with tens of thousands of military and civilian personnel and their families			0
the primary unit on @entity64 is the @entity9 's @entity257 , according to the website , and the primary unit on @entity248 is the @entity261 's @entity260			0
in addition , the joint base houses " more than 30 different units from the @entity9 , @entity261 , @entity266 , @entity267 , @entity268 and @entity269 and @entity271 agencies , " the site says			0
the suspect in sunday 's shootings acted alone and turned himself in after the incident , according to @entity14 officials			0
a @entity2 military official , who asked not to be named because of the pending investigation , said the suspect is in his mid- 30s and has served several tours in @entity128 , although this was his first deployment to @entity7			1
the incident shocked @entity2 officials and prompted outrage in @entity7 and has fueled fears of intensified anger against @entity2 troops in @entity7 that erupted in deadly riots last month over the inadvertent burning of qurans by @entity2 troops			2
the soldier accused in sunday 's deaths remained in @entity2 custody on monday as investigators try to determine his motive , including examining his mental stability and medical history .			0
