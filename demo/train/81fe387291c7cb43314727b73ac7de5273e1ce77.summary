@entity0 , @entity1 -- interior secretary @entity3 on tuesday called a six - month halt on deepwater drilling " needed , appropriate and within our authorities " in announcing he will issue a new order on a moratorium just hours after a federal judge blocked such a mandate			1
" we see clear evidence every day , as oil spills from @entity16 's well , of the need for a pause on deepwater drilling , " @entity3 said in a statement			1
" that evidence mounts as @entity16 continues to be unable to stop its blowout , notwithstanding the huge efforts and help from the federal scientific team and most major oil companies operating in the @entity24			2
" @entity3 's statement did not give an exact date for when the new order would be imposed , saying only " in the coming days			1
" he promised that the new order will include evidence that " eliminates any doubt that a moratorium is needed , appropriate , and within our authorities			1
" @entity32 district judge @entity31 in @entity0 , @entity1 issued a preliminary injunction tuesday against the ban , which halted all drilling in more than 500 feet of water and prevented new permits from being issued			1
the @entity38 said it would appeal the ruling			1
president @entity40 ordered the moratorium after the april 20 explosion of the @entity43 , an oil rig off @entity1			1
eleven people died in the blast , which triggered an underwater oil gusher			0
@entity49 , an attorney for the @entity50 , insisted monday that the suspension is necessary while officials conduct a safety review			0
but a group of companies that provides boats and equipment to the offshore drilling industry filed a lawsuit claiming the government has no evidence that existing operations pose a threat to the @entity24 and asked the court to declare the moratorium invalid and unenforceable			1
@entity31 agreed , writing in his ruling , " an invalid agency decision to suspend drilling of wells in depths of over 500 feet simply can not justify the immeasurable effect on the plaintiffs , the local economy , the @entity74 , and the critical present - day aspect of the availability of domestic energy in this country			1
" @entity38 spokesman @entity79 said the government will immediately appeal the ruling to the 5th @entity82			1
" the president strongly believes , as the @entity84 and @entity50 argued yesterday , that continuing to drill at these depths without knowing what happened does not make any sense , " @entity79 said			0
such drilling " puts the safety of those involved , potentially puts safety of those on the rigs and the safety of the environment and the @entity24 at a danger that the president does not believe we can afford right now			1
" in issuing the ruling , @entity31 said , " the court is unable to divine or fathom a relationship between the findings ( of the government ) and the immense scope of the moratorium			1
the plaintiffs assert that they have suffered and will continue to suffer irreparable harm as a result of the moratorium			0
" @entity112 president @entity111 , whose company owned the @entity43 , said tuesday that he supported ending the moratorium , and the office of @entity1 gov. @entity116 filed a brief in support of blocking the moratorium			1
@entity116 and sen. @entity120 , @entity1 , were among those asking the @entity40 administration tuesday not to appeal the ruling			1
" i 'm going to strongly urge the administration not to appeal this ruling , but to try to find a way forward that would achieve the president 's goals for safety and responsibility , but at the same time would not jeopardize and threaten a very vibrant and necessary industry for decades , " @entity120 told reporters during a conference call			1
@entity133 : in the @entity24 ? share your experience with @entity16 legendary @entity138 oil and gas executive @entity136 also said such a ban is not needed			1
" the accident that @entity16 has had could be likened to qualified pilots in an airliner and they have pilot error , " he told @entity2 's " @entity141 " program tuesday night			2
" ( an ) airliner crashes , starts a 50,000 - acre forest fire and we shut down all flying ? no more airlines until we have six months to see what happened ? " @entity151 , the president of the @entity152 , said tuesday that while the ruling is positive for his group -- which represents many of the ships that service oil rigs -- the decision is " tempered by the realization this is a big , strong government			1
and if they want to keep fighting on this , they will keep fighting			0
" @entity151 told @entity2 that many of the small business owners and workers who support the rigs felt " like innocent bystanders in all this , " adding that many of them are losing their jobs left and right			0
he said @entity31 's decision " may help our industry survive			1
" government estimates indicate as much as 60,000 barrels ( 2.5 million gallons ) of oil may be flowing into the @entity24 every day , and the gusher has already taken a serious toll on tourism and the fishing industry in @entity183 states			2
@entity16 said tuesday it had collected 25,830 barrels -- 1.08 million gallons -- of oil from the gushing undersea well over the past 24 hours			0
the amount is the most ever collected ; the previous record was set thursday when 25,290 barrels were collected			0
the company announced tuesday that it will donate net revenues it receives from the sale of oil recovered from the spill to the @entity193			0
also tuesday , protesters in @entity195 , @entity196 , briefly disrupted an oil conference that @entity16 ceo @entity198 pulled out of a day earlier			0
just before the welcoming speech by @entity16 chief of staff @entity201 , who was standing in for @entity198 at the @entity203 , a woman got on stage and started shouting			0
the woman was @entity208 campaigner @entity207 , who told the crowd that " because @entity16 is incapable of telling you the truth , i 'm going to tell you what you need to know			0
" @entity198 decided not to attend the conference because of his " commitment to the @entity24 relief effort , " a @entity16 spokesman said monday			0
@entity201 started his speech by apologizing on @entity198 's behalf for him not being at the conference			2
he said the past few weeks have been " extremely difficult for @entity16			0
" " it has been hugely shocking for us , for @entity32 , and for the rest of the world , " @entity201 said			0
" everyone at @entity16 is devastated , and we deeply regret what 's happened			2
our hearts go out to those who have lost loved ones			0
and we are profoundly aware of our responsibilities to those people whose livelihoods and neighborhoods have suffered			0
" @entity233 , who is overseeing @entity16 's $ 20 billion escrow claims fund , met with @entity236 gov. @entity235 on tuesday in what @entity235 described as a " very , very productive meeting " to discuss ways to accelerate the claims payment process			2
" i will be back quickly to spend as much time as it takes to make sure that this program is designed and implemented in an expeditious manner , " @entity233 said			0
@entity16 said in a statement monday that costs from the disaster now total about $ 2 billion , including the cost of the response , containment , relief well drilling , grants to @entity183 , claims paid and federal costs			2
to date , more than 65,000 claims have been submitted and more than 32,000 payments totaling more than $ 105 million have been made , the company said			0
elsewhere , a spokesman for @entity258 's foreign ministry said the @entity260 republic , which has chilly relations with the @entity32 , would consider helping @entity32 with the oil spill if asked , according to the @entity263			2
" the difficult solution of an oil spill , from the standpoint that it 's a humanitarian problem , persuades all countries to offer help , " @entity263 quoted @entity265 spokesman @entity264 as saying			2
@entity2 's @entity271 , @entity272 , @entity273 , @entity274 , @entity275 , @entity276 and @entity277 contributed to this report .			2
