-- a @entity2 woman -- a former inmate in @entity3 , @entity4 -- claims in a lawsuit that sheriff 's officers mistreated her during and after her pregnancy , including shackling her while she was in labor and after her caesarean section			1
the federal suit filed by @entity12 this week comes days after the @entity14 @entity13 alleged the @entity15 , under the leadership of sheriff @entity17 , engaged in a pattern of discrimination against @entity20			1
@entity12 's suit is against the sheriff 's office , @entity17 , the @entity24 and unidentified male and female officers , doctors and nurses			1
@entity12 , a @entity2 citizen , alleges in the suit she was arrested october 23 , 2009 , by @entity29 , @entity4 , police , and was booked into @entity3 's @entity31 on charges of identity theft			1
she was held without bond under @entity4 law			2
according to the police report filed at the time of her arrest , @entity12 was accused of using someone else 's name , date of birth and @entity44 number to obtain work			2
she was arrested at her place of employment , a department store , while she was vacuuming the floor			1
when arrested , she was six months ' pregnant and had developed gestational diabetes and high blood pressure , according to the suit			1
on december 10 , 2009 , @entity12 pleaded guilty to solicitation to commit forgery under a plea agreement			2
her sentencing was set for december 24			2
while incarcerated , in what her attorney , @entity57 , called " two months of hell , " @entity12 says in the suit that she was told by jail staff she would receive a " special " pregnancy diet			2
that diet , she claims , consisted of " items such as two slices ( of ) cheese or ham , two slices of bread , indistinguishable cooked vegetables and occasionally a piece of fruit			2
" she also said she was given two small cartons of milk a day and a pill that she was told was a vitamin			2
on days when she was transported to court , @entity12 said , she was given no food during the day			2
in one instance , she alleges in the suit , an officer taunted her and other inmates with his food , telling them there was no food for them			2
on december 20 , four days before her sentencing , @entity12 began to have contractions , according to the suit			2
she was shackled at her ankles and taken to the @entity89 , where medical personnel determined she was not in labor and returned her to the jail			1
by the following day , however , her pain had increased			2
" ms. @entity12 had been left in the jail visitation room , in extreme pain , " the suit says			0
guards ignored her attempts to speak to them in @entity99 , so she asked an @entity101 - speaking person in the room to tell them she needed help			1
she was again taken to the @entity89 , where she gave birth to a son via caesarean section			1
she was shackled before and after the surgery , according to the suit			1
while she was recovering , a male correctional officer " insisted that she be shackled to the hospital bed , " and the shackles on her feet were painful , according to the lawsuit			1
asked about the allegations in 2010 , @entity15 lt. @entity115 said in a statement that @entity12 " was not shackled during or directly after her medical procedure			1
after the procedure , she did have a soft restraint attached on one leg to her bed to prevent escape			0
" @entity3 sheriff 's spokesman @entity124 referred to the earlier statement when asked about the suit			1
@entity115 said @entity12 was treated the way any other inmate would be while receiving treatment " in an unsecured facility			0
although she was being held on a @entity132 felony , @entity15 would have treated other inmates in the same manner			0
" @entity12 was not initially shackled , thanks to a " guardian angel " guard , @entity137 said , but " she has her c - section , the guards change and this new guard comes in as she 's recovering from this major surgery and insists on shackling her to the bed			1
" " it 's incredibly painful , it 's incredibly dangerous because now she ca n't move around , she ca n't avoid clotting , and he refuses to take the shackle off , " @entity137 said			0
@entity12 was not allowed to hold or nurse her baby , the suit alleges			0
she was discharged on december 23 , but was not given a wheelchair to leave the hospital , the suit says			0
" wearing only a hospital gown , ms. @entity12 was forced to walk through the hospital with her hands and feet shackled , " according to the suit			1
meanwhile , she began to bleed , the suit says			0
a nurse " scolded " the corrections officer for taking her " so quickly and without ms. @entity12 receiving her pain medication or discharge paperwork , " so she was again chained and forced to walk back to the nurse 's station , according to the suit			0
" ms. @entity12 was in so much pain she could hardly walk , " the suit says			0
" shackled at her hands and ankles , with a bleeding surgery wound , ms. @entity12 was returned to the @entity167 jail			1
" she spent the nights following her discharge " in pain and crying , " the suit says			0
@entity172 spokesman @entity171 , asked about shackling inmates in labor , said hospital staff defers to law enforcement , according to the suit			1
@entity178 spokeswoman @entity177 declined comment on the matter wednesday			0
" i 'd like to think that any woman held in that jail is going to be treated with respect and dignity , " @entity137 said			0
@entity12 declined to be interviewed , saying she fears retaliation by the sheriff 's office			0
international standards say using restraints on pregnant women " is cruel , inhumane and degrading treatment , and given medical or other factors impeding pregnant or birthing women from attempting escape or becoming violent , the presumption must be that no restraints should be applied , " the suit says			0
" a woman 's privacy and dignity must be respected during labor and birth			1
" international standards also say a pregnant woman in her third trimester should not be restrained while being transported , and efforts should be made " to afford the mother reasonable access to the baby without impeding her movements by restraints , " according to the suit			0
the @entity210 and the @entity211 oppose the shackling of women in labor or after delivery , the suit says			1
the @entity215 , the @entity216 and the @entity217 have all eliminated the practice			0
the suit claims officers violated @entity12 's rights , including her right to be protected from cruel and unusual punishment			0
hospital staffers ' deferring to law enforcement officers regarding the shackling of women in labor and after delivery also " demonstrates an ongoing policy of deliberate indifference to ms. @entity12 's serious medical needs , " according to the suit			1
it also alleges that a @entity14 citizen in a similar situation would be less likely to be shackled			1
" ms. @entity12 was subject to a lower standard of medical care -- and a higher degree of danger to her and ( her ) fetus -- than similarly - situated women who are @entity14 citizens , " the suit says			1
" this disparate treatment is consistent with the findings of the @entity13 regarding the systemic bias towards @entity20 demonstrated by @entity245 and the @entity15			0
" @entity17 is known as " @entity14 's toughest sheriff " for his stance against illegal immigration			0
he and his attorneys last week condemned the @entity13 civil rights investigation as politically motivated and a " witch hunt			0
" @entity12 seeks a jury trial and damages in the suit			0
journalist @entity255 in @entity256 contributed to this report .			0
