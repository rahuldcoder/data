-- flat racing has @entity2 ; tennis has @entity4 ; football has the @entity6			1
but for fans of national hunt racing -- a grueling form of the sport which combines speed , stamina and accuracy over a course of at least two miles with an array of imposing jumps -- there is no meeting like the @entity19			1
although jumps racing carries a lower social status than flat racing in the @entity25 , its following is arguably bigger			2
what is unarguable is that its fans are as passionate , its jockeys as skilled and its horses as brave as any to be found in the @entity31 or @entity32			2
this year 's meeting had been menaced by inclement weather , which threatened to turn the @entity36 course into a mud bath			2
as if on cue , by the first day of the festival on tuesday , the flood waters which had engulfed much of the west of @entity41 for the past month receded and a distinct flavor of spring was in the air			1
but despite the blue skies overhead , the event is taking place under a cloud			2
racing is emerging from an " annus horribilis , " following a doping scandal at one of its largest training operations , @entity54			2
although the glossy version of the sport as practiced by @entity60 's flat racing empire may seem like a distant cousin to the earthier winter form , racing 's other code has not emerged unscathed			2
one of the fancied runners in friday 's @entity64 -- the highlight of the festival and the most prestigious jumps race in the @entity25 racing calendar -- is trained by a man who has been charged with possession of anabolic steroids and who is due in court next week			2
last instalment is one of three runners fielded by @entity77 , who faces eight charges of possessing banned animal remedies which were found by the @entity81 @entity80 in 2012			2
all three of his @entity19 entries have been cleared to run by the @entity87 , after blood and hair samples found they have been " clean " for at least the past 12 months			1
but should @entity89 or any of @entity77 's other runners win this week , it will be publicity the sport can scarcely afford			0
nevertheless , even these lingering storm clouds could not dampen the famous @entity19 roar , the battle cry which goes up amid a flurry of fur and tweed to mark the beginning of jumps racing 's biggest week			1
nor , even , could the injury - enforced absence of two of jumps racing 's brightest stars -- the imperious @entity102 and the plucky @entity105			0
accents from both sides of the @entity108 can be heard at @entity19			1
national hunt racing originated in @entity81 in the 18th century and the @entity81 remain devoted to this form of the sport			0
as such , the @entity19 is famed for the rivalry between @entity25 and @entity81			1
this year , that rivalry is being formally recognized with the newly - commissioned @entity113 , to be awarded to the country with the most winners and named after the first @entity19 , organized in 1902 at @entity117 racecourse			1
on this occasion it was first blood to @entity81 as @entity121 and @entity122 teamed up to give trainer @entity123 a decisive victory in the opening @entity126			1
" we knew he was a good horse but i was n't quite expecting that , " @entity123 told reporters			0
" he was a bit free over the first couple of hurdles but once he relaxed a bit and @entity122 had accepted that he wanted to get on with it , he let him gallop and use his stride			0
next thing you know , he was on a different set of rails to the other horses ! " the same combination nearly struck gold again moments later with @entity144 in the @entity145 but were pipped on the line by @entity147 's 33 - 1 shot @entity148 , ridden by @entity149			1
" i 'm surprised , relieved and very happy to have a winner , " said @entity147			0
" @entity149 gave him a canny ride			0
you could sense @entity149 felt he was more than a 33 - 1 shot and had a bit of a chance			0
it 's great to have a winner here because it is so hard			0
" in the day 's feature race , the @entity160 , 9 - 1 shot @entity162 led home a memorable one - two for leading owner @entity164 , edging out @entity165 , ridden by man of the hour @entity167			1
" it 's fantastic and a great to be in this position , " trainer @entity168 told reporters after watching @entity170 ride her horse home to victory			0
" he 's a great favorite of mine and @entity170 has a great record on him			0
" the race however was marred by a fatal injury to @entity181 , which had to be put down after falling			0
owner @entity183 told reporters : " it 's is very sad , as he was such a young horse at the beginning of his career			0
" he had already shown what enormous potential he had			0
" it is unusual for him , as jumping has been his forte and it was such a surprise to see him come down			0
" meanwhile , former @entity41 football star @entity194 has already made a successful transition to leading racehorse owner -- he has even had a winner at @entity2 -- but perhaps his latest reinvention should be as tipster			1
on the opening day of @entity19 , @entity194 tipped three winners in a row -- @entity203 in the opening handicap , @entity162 in the @entity160 and @entity205 , who won the @entity206 for a sixth successive year , making her the most successful horse in festival history			1
all eyes will surely be on @entity194 's tips when the second day of the meeting gets underway on wednesday .			1

@entity19 began in @entity41 tuesday
@entity213 earns @entity126 success
@entity215 wins @entity145 , @entity162 takes champions @entity216
