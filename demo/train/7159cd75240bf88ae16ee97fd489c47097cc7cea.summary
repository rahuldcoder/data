@entity0 -- lt. col. @entity2 is not a bionic man , but he does have a new set of powerful knees			1
@entity7 war veteran lt. col. @entity2 shows off his new knees at @entity9			1
@entity2 , an @entity7 veteran , was wounded in 2007 by a roadside bomb and lost both legs above the knees			1
this week , he became the first person to receive the latest version of battery - powered prosthetic knees			1
@entity2 demonstrated his new knees during a news conference thursday at @entity9 in @entity0			1
it 's " as if you were driving a school bus and then someone put you in a sports car -- you still know how to drive			0
there 's quite a different feeling , " he said			0
the @entity25 uses sensors ( in contact with the thigh muscle , for example ) to anticipate how the user will move , and then shifts itself into position			1
" this is the second generation @entity25 , " says @entity33 , a spokesperson for @entity34 , the manufacturer			1
" it uses the same type of technology , but it 's half the size , makes half the noise , is half the weight and is much more intelligent			0
" @entity33 says the knee is learning in real time to react to a patient so the patient does n't have to think about walking			2
" there are sensors and artificial intelligence in the prosthetic that are watching what the body is doing			1
the biggest benefit is by doing so much work on its own , the amputee does n't have to think about movement			0
" @entity2 , who had an older model of the powered knees , praised the latest ones			1
" these knees are a lot lighter			2
they 're quieter and they have significantly longer battery life , " he said , adding that the batteries can last up to 16 hours			0
@entity2 said he hopes his pioneering efforts will help others			1
" if this proves to open a door for other people , that 's a tremendous feeling , a tremendous reward			0
i 'm not doing it for that , but i hope that this is a path for people to really expand their lives , " he said			0
@entity76 , a prosthetist who has been working with @entity2 , said he thinks prosthetics of the future will be more powerful			2
the first @entity25 appeared in 2006			2
@entity76 expects the improved version to reach the general population in 2010			2
" it was n't designed for military use ; it was designed as a knee for everybody , " @entity76 said			0
" we 're fortunate enough here to be able to put this technology to its test here at @entity9 , but as a broader application			0
you know , a year would be great to see these legs on vascular amputees , because it does improve mobility			0
" the goal is to come up with technology that adapts to all situations , according to col. @entity98 , one of @entity2 's doctors			1
" we try to challenge each one of our members into real - life situations where they have to use their prostheses not to just walk in straight directions , but to move in an environment that would be simulations of his home -- going up and down stairs , up and down curbs -- so we try to challenge the technology as much as possible			2
" @entity2 is getting used to the new knees and wears them a few hours daily for now			1
but he has long - term goals for his new limbs			0
" my expectations are that i can do whatever it is i used to do , maybe a little bit different			0
i have some other considerations , and if i can do those things , then i think that 's success			0
