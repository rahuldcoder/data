-- many @entity1 were startled awake monday night and early tuesday morning by @entity2 that made screeching noises on their cell phones			1
some people even took to @entity6 to complain			2
they better get used to it			0
the alerts about a blue @entity9 -- possibly carrying @entity10 , 8 , and sister @entity11 , 16 -- were the first sent statewide in @entity1 under a new program that sends @entity14 about abducted children via text messages to millions of mobile phones			1
the texts are accompanied by a high - pitched squealing sound to get the phone owner 's attention			0
@entity22 , whose daughter @entity23 was kidnapped from her @entity1 home in 1993 and later found dead , was an unlikely critic of monday 's statewide alerts , telling @entity0 that while the messages were well intended , their rollout was " pretty abysmal			1
" he feared residents might be put off by the harsh noise and opt out of the program			2
cell phones have been receiving @entity14 since 2005 under a partnership between the wireless industry , the @entity34 and the @entity35			2
but people had to sign up to receive the alerts -- only about 700,000 did -- and then designate the areas they wanted to get alerts for			1
they would then only receive alerts for those chosen areas , regardless of where they were physically located			2
so you could be from @entity45 but vacationing in @entity46 , for example , and not get an @entity48 about an abduction a dozen miles from your @entity51 hotel			0
that system was replaced on december 31 , 2012 , by the @entity54 program , run by @entity55 , which sends free , automatic notifications to almost every phone in the surrounding area or even the state			2
cellphone owners now receive @entity14 , as well as emergency weather alerts , based on their proximity to the emergency , not the location of their phone number			2
and people must opt out if they prefer not to get the alerts			1
@entity68 : what you should know about mobile amber alerts the messages are sent over a special wireless carrier channel called @entity74 and are n't affected by congestion that might disrupt regular calls and text messages , according to the @entity35			0
about 100 @entity78 , sent simultaneously to all compatible mobile devices within range of the cellular towers in the affected area , have been sent nationwide so far under the @entity54 program			0
the program was credited with locating an abducted 8 - month - old boy in @entity86 in february			1
a @entity88 teenager saw an @entity48 on his phone and called police about a neighbor whose @entity92 matched the description in the alert			0
the neighbor was arrested , and the infant was recovered unharmed			0
carriers representing 98 % of all @entity99 wireless subscribers are on the new program , and more than 200 models of phones support the alerts , said @entity104 , an assistant vice president for regulatory affairs at @entity105 , the wireless industry trade association			1
the alerts " are absolutely saving lives , " @entity104 said			1
" we have stressed that these alerts have been used judiciously , sparingly , " he added , when asked about irritated reactions to monday 's @entity2 in @entity1			1
once phone users understand what it is , " they appreciate the information , " he said			0
some older phones , including the @entity117 , will not receive the alerts			1
people can choose not to hear @entity14 by adjusting the notification settings on their phones			1
monday 's alert was the third @entity48 in @entity1 in 2013 to use the new system , although the first two were only broadcast to phones in specific counties			1
a massive manhunt was under way tuesday and wednesday in @entity1 for @entity11 , 40 , whom law enforcement authorities describe as a friend of the children 's mother , @entity130			1
launched in @entity132 in 1996 , @entity14 were originally sent out via radio , tv and electronic highway signs as part of the national emergency - alert system that includes warnings about extreme weather such as tornadoes and hurricanes			0
some critics of monday 's alert said it was too vague , offering only a description of the wanted vehicle without further context			0
but @entity1 should appreciate that such a notification system exists in times of crisis , wrote columnist @entity150 in the @entity151			2
" the fact that the alerts were broadcast indiscriminately to @entity155 - area cellphones ( and later , to all @entity1 phones capable of receiving text messages , as the alert went statewide ) clearly annoyed a lot of wireless customers , " he wrote			1
" but the alerts ca n't really be targeted if police do n't know where the kidnapper is , and it 's impossible to predict who might be in a position to help			0
so @entity48 has to cast a wide net to have any hope of succeeding			0
" yes , it might have helped if the message had been less cryptic			0
but now that we 've all seen one , we should be able to recognize what such alerts are trying to tell us			0

@entity1 were startled awake this week by @entity2 on their phones
the alerts were the first sent statewide in @entity1 under a new program
some people were annoyed by the alerts , while others cite them for saving lives
@entity10 , 8 , and sister @entity11 , 16 , were abducted last *weekend*
