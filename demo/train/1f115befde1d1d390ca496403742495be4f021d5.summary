@entity0 -- in 2007 , i co-founded @entity3 with my business partner , @entity4 , to help address the problem of global malnutrition			1
@entity7 had designed the first feed bag , which provides school meals to children through the @entity11 , where i was working			0
we have since sold more than half a million bags around the world and donated close to $ 6 million to provide more than 55 million school meals to children and raise awareness about a crucial humanitarian issue			1
but here at home in @entity21 , it 's hard not to notice a different food - related problem : obesity			1
it 's affecting everyone , from small children to the elderly , and it 's growing			0
as an anti-hunger advocate , i found the perplexity of the obesity problem and the hunger problem existing side - by - side in our increasingly global food system begged further investigation			1
read an interview with @entity38 at @entity39 about 30 years ago , a few key things happened that changed @entity21 and global agriculture			1
first , our farms consolidated after the oil crisis of the 1970s and focused more on growing highly subsidized commodities such as corn , soy and wheat			2
concurrently , we began to cut international agriculture development aid			2
since 1980 , @entity21 development aid for @entity53 farmers has fallen by 85 percent			1
with @entity21 farmers producing lots of excess corn , soy and wheat and farmers in the poorest parts of the world receiving less support , the way we 've eaten here and around the world has changed in the past 30 years			1
today , 75 percent of food products in supermarkets and fast food outlets contain corn , soy or wheat			2
the introduction of high - fructose corn syrup , first widely used in 1980 , as a new outlet for corn has led to a dramatic increase in soda consumption and to a whole range of cheap , sugary foods			0
chicken mcnuggets , introduced in 1980 , were a harbinger of the increase in cheap meat , for which 80 percent of the @entity21 corn crop is used as animal feed			1
changes in food consumption since 1980 have directly led to changes in our global waistline , so that today 1.6 billion people on the planet are overweight			2
that 's a threefold increase since 1980 , according to @entity94 , with projections of 2.3 billion adults overweight by 2015			0
learn about @entity98 's anti-obesity project the abundance of cheap food with low nutritional value in the @entity103 diet has wreaked havoc on our health ; in @entity21 , one third of children and two thirds of adults are overweight or obese and are more likely to develop diabetes and cardiovascular disease			1
but another one billion people on the planet are still hungry			0
our systems that produce massive amounts of cheap food are not helping the regions of the world where small farmers still toil amidst more regular droughts and famines			1
the average number of food crises per year having doubled since 1980			0
furthermore , our old food aid model , based on sending excess @entity21 grain to persistently hungry populations , has not helped farmers around the world develop reliable systems to prevent hunger			1
that said , some aid organizations , such as the @entity11 and @entity134 , run programs to support poor farmers			0
and political support for agricultural development is building in @entity138			0
watch @entity140 's talk on sustainable fish farming taking the wider view , obesity and hunger look like two sides of the same core problem : malnutrition because of a lack of access to nutritious foods			2
in light of the changes in the past 30 years -- which have led to one billion people overweight , one billion hungry and an imbalanced global agricultural system -- i created the 30 project			0
it 's a long - term campaign to address global food system issues			1
as a new campaign of the @entity160 , the 30 project will raise awareness about the systemic underpinnings of hunger and obesity , align the activists on both fights toward long - term change and facilitate local and regional discussions of food system challenges			1
i have hope that if we take a 30 - year view of the future , we can create a food system that addresses the needs and health of the planet and its growing population			0
maybe we need to rethink regional food systems for every community , from @entity181 to @entity182 to the @entity183 , so we can buy more fresh food in our local economies			0
maybe we need to change the way we value the food we eat , so that a " value meal " is something we are proud to feed our children			0
maybe we need to re-engage our smart , energetic youth around the world to be farmers and find fresh , green technologies that will feed the world more fresh greens			2
maybe we should commit to a goal that every child , in every country , will have access to nutritious food in school that will nourish their bodies and their minds			0
to address our current food system problems , i propose a series of local , regional , national and global conversations -- starting around the dinner table -- to rethink the food we produce , buy and eat			1
a healthier agricultural system at home and abroad would produce healthier food options for all eaters			0
we can all vote with our food dollars every day for the health of ourselves , our families and the world			2
now that we know the outcome of our past three decades of food production and consumption , let 's start to change the system -- one bite at a time			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity38 .			2

@entity38 says world faces twin problems of hunger and obesity
farms produced large amount of *ingredients* for cheap food , with low nutritional value
@entity21 has *sharply* cut its development assistance for @entity53 farmers
@entity38 : we need to address two problems together as global food issue
