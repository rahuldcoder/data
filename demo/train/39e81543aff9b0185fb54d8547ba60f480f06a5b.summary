-- the charge against @entity2 for allegedly using low - grade explosives housed in pressure cookers to bomb the @entity7 is " using and conspiring to use a weapon of mass destruction			1
" for many , the term " weapon of mass destruction " -- or @entity10 -- means something far more apocalyptic than the @entity13 attack , tragic though that was			1
for those people it will forever be associated with the run - up to the @entity17 , when leaders of the @entity20 - led coalition warned that @entity21 was building up his stocks of @entity10 -- a claim that turned out to be incorrect			1
watch : 10 years later -- @entity17 's phantom @entity10 so , when and how did a pressure cooker -- allegedly filled with low - grade explosives , metallic bbs and nails -- become a wmd and where did the phrase come from ? many sources point to a 1937 address by the then archbishop of canterbury @entity34 , as the first time the phrase weapons of mass destruction was used			1
in a report at the time , @entity38 's @entity37 newspaper quoted @entity34 as referring to wars in @entity41 and @entity42 and saying : " who can think without horror of what another widespread war would mean , waged as it would be with all the new weapons of mass destruction			1
" it is unclear exactly which weapons @entity34 was referring to , however , in april 1937 @entity56 bombers had systematically destroyed the @entity58 town of @entity51 during the @entity59 , prompting @entity37 correspondent @entity60 to write on april 27 , 1937 : " in the form of its execution and the scale of the destruction it wrought , no less than the selection of its objective , the raid on @entity51 is unparalleled in military history			2
" he described " first , hand grenades and heavy bombs to stampede the population , then machine - gunning to drive them below , next heavy and incendiary bombs to wreck the houses and burn them on top of their victims			2
" the same year , @entity79 had invaded @entity41 , where its troops were widely accused of gross human rights abuses , including raping tens of thousands of girls and women and killing several hundred thousand others in december 1937 , in what has come to be called " the rape of @entity87			2
" read more : @entity79 fires military chief over @entity90 denial nine years later , the @entity37 referred to a report by the @entity93 mission to @entity94 after the @entity79 city became the first victim of an atom bomb			0
it quoted the report as opening : " @entity100 consider that a full understanding of the consequences of the new form of attack may assist the @entity105 in its task of securing the control of atomic energy for the common good and in abolishing the use of weapons of mass destruction			1
" indeed , the @entity105 's first resolution in 1946 established a committee whose tasks included making specific proposals " for the elimination from national armaments of atomic weapons and of all other major weapons adaptable to mass destruction			1
" in their 2012 paper for the @entity20 government 's @entity129 , " @entity125 , " authors @entity123 and w. @entity126 wrote that , in terms of disarmament policy , the definitive definition of @entity10 had emerged at the @entity105 in 1948			2
it covered " ... atomic explosive weapons , radioactive material weapons , lethal chemical and biological weapons , and any weapons developed in the future which have characteristics comparable in destructive effect to those of the atomic bomb or other weapons mentioned above , " they said			2
in may 2002 , the then @entity105 under - secretary - general for @entity148 , @entity147 , told the @entity149 that @entity10 " today consist of nuclear , biological , and chemical arms -- they all share one deadly trait : they are indiscriminately lethal			1
" @entity154 went on to say : " they are neither lightly nor inappropriately called ' weapons of mass destruction			1
' " @entity123 and @entity126 said they had identified " more than 50 wmd definitions issued by a government or international organization			0
" the definition in the @entity20 @entity164 included high explosives and was " inconsistent with most national guidance and with the usage preferred by the @entity168 and the international community , " they said			0
" almost all crimes " prosecuted under this definition could be prosecuted under other provisions of the @entity20 criminal code , they suggested			0
bombs , grenades , rockets " having a propellant charge of more than four ounces , a missile having an explosive or incendiary charge of more than one - quarter ounce " and mines , are among the explosives covered by the criminal code 's definition of @entity10			1
@entity186 -- professor of law at @entity187 -- said the statute @entity2 had been charged under -- @entity190 title 18 , section 2332a -- defined @entity10 " far more broadly than that phrase is normally understood			1
" " at the bottom , it is simply a statute that makes it a felony to set off bombs in public places , which certainly applies in this case			0
unless the government were to try to take advantage of the @entity10 language to try to convince the public that this defendant was using a wmd in the usual narrow and scary sense of that phrase , there 's really no harm in the situation in my view , " he said			1
@entity186 noted that in order for a prosecution for using @entity10 within the @entity20 to be successful , at least one of four conditions relating to interstate or foreign commerce also needed to be proved against the defendant			2
in the case of the @entity13 bombings " the easiest one to prove would be the impact - on - commerce condition -- there 's just no real doubt that the bombing had a tremendously disruptive impact on interstate commerce , " he said			0
@entity230 's @entity229 told @entity0 's @entity231 he was surprised the wmd charge had been used against @entity2			1
" everybody thought that the indictment would be under the federal terrorism statute , " he said			0
" instead they charged him under a very rarely used statute involving explosion of weapons of mass destruction that result in the death of an individual			1
" @entity229 said the charge put less emphasis on the intention behind the attack			0
" under the terrorism statute , you would have to , in effect , charge a jihadist or extreme @entity252 motivation			0
here you do n't have to show any motivation at all , " he said			0
" so the government has made a decision not to charge this as a politically motivated crime			0
" @entity20 @entity261 spokesman @entity260 said the statute had been " frequently used " by the department			0
among the recent examples cited by @entity260 was the case of @entity267 student @entity266 who was convicted and sentenced to life in 2012 for attempted use of a @entity10			2
according to a departmental release , the charge followed @entity266 's " purchase of chemicals and equipment necessary to make an improvised explosive device ( @entity275 ) and his research of potential @entity20 targets			0
" the @entity10 law also applies to " any national of the @entity20 who , without lawful authority , uses or threatens , attempts , or conspires to use a weapon of mass destruction outside of the @entity20			1
" in march 2013 , former @entity20 soldier @entity285 was charged under this part of the statute for allegedly conspiring to use a rocket propelled grenade while fighting with an @entity290 affiliated group in @entity291			1

" @entity10 had been used to refer to chemical , biological , radiological and nuclear ( @entity303 ) , but the term had more recently been used for " deliberate political reasons " and broadened out , @entity294 said			1
" it 's increasingly just something explosive or destructive that makes the term so broad as to be meaningless , " he said			0
" in 2002 , there were n't people talking about pressure cookers as @entity10			1
" in the build - up to the @entity17 , @entity294 said , the phrase was used strategically to create legitimacy for intervention			1
reports out of the @entity317 , he said , suggested that the need to combat a perceived @entity10 threat was something on which all of the " coalition of the willing " could agree			2
but he said the phrase had different connotations in the @entity20 and @entity93			0
@entity93 's then prime minister @entity325 was a strident proponent of the argument , telling @entity93 lawmakers that @entity21 could launch a range of @entity10 within 45 minutes			1
read more : @entity325 adviser denies @entity17 intelligence ' sexed up ' " @entity10 was more controversial as a term and a rationale in the @entity93 because @entity325 put more emphasis on the argument than [ president @entity335 ] @entity335 did , " @entity294 said			1
this was because @entity325 needed to appeal to the @entity93 public with a " legalistic , logical , pragmatic " argument , he said , whereas @entity335 could " employ a series of more emotive arguments " and use @entity10 as a " fallback argument to a far greater degree , because of @entity20 political culture			2
" " @entity93 needed a ' pseudo-legalistic rationale ' , " @entity294 said			0
" it was about the 45 - minute claim -- that was very much an argument that appealed peculiarly to the @entity93 , " he said			2
" @entity325 put all of his eggs in one basket with the @entity10 argument			2
" in @entity93 , the phrase was now tainted because of its political connotations that the administration had lied or had been just plain wrong			0
" now it 's seen as a false premise for an unsuccessful intervention , " @entity294 said			0
" the strategic use of language to sell interventions to the public is an extremely long - standing phenomenon			0
more recently these arguments are ever more important for making the case for war , " he said			0
" there 's a perceived need -- even if you 've won an election -- to retain the image of speaking for a population , " he said			0
" to get the population onside is essential			0
