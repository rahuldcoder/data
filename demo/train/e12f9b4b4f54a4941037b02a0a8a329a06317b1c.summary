@entity0 -- in 1994 , on the eve of his trip to @entity5 to persuade @entity6 to negotiate with the @entity8 administration over its nuclear program , @entity2 had a series of briefings at the @entity12			1
after several hours , @entity2 looked around the room at the group of diplomats assembled and said , " none of you have told me what i need to know , " according to a former @entity12 official involved in briefing the former president			0
" you have n't told me what @entity6 wants , " @entity2 told his briefers			0
" what he wants is my respect			0
and i am going to give it to him			0
" sources knowledgeable about @entity2 's trip to @entity29 this week to free @entity31 @entity30 expect the former president to take the same approach he used with @entity6 in dealing with his son , current leader @entity34			1
@entity2 , they say , will give the @entity5 leader the respect he craves , giving him a face - saving way to release @entity30			1
as with last year 's mission by former president @entity8 to free journalists @entity40 and @entity42 , the deal with @entity5 was already done before @entity2 boarded the plane			1
in fact , the @entity5 have been looking for a visit from @entity2 for some time			2
@entity47 professor @entity46 , who helped arrange @entity2 's 1994 trip and played a role in this one , said he brought up the possibility of high - level talks with the former @entity31 president during @entity55 's trip to @entity29 in july			1
@entity46 said the release of @entity30 was actually a secondary reason for @entity2 's visit , the first being restarting talks with the @entity31			1
" the release was not the @entity5 purpose , " said @entity46 , who has visited the communist nation 52 times			0
" they wanted to have a much more substantive discussion when the official line is seemingly blocked			0
" there was no shortage of envoys ready to travel to @entity5 and negotiate @entity30 release			0
@entity71 , a former @entity31 ambassador to the @entity72 , has gone on previous missions to @entity5 , including the negotiated release of a detained @entity31			2
he continues to hold occasional talks with @entity5 diplomats			2
sen. @entity77 , chairman of the @entity78 , was also closely involved in coordinating efforts with the @entity80 and @entity12 to free @entity30 , who is one of his constituents , said his spokesman , @entity83			0
it was @entity77 , @entity83 said , who informed the @entity12 about @entity30 ' arrest and has been urging the department to do " whatever it takes " to secure @entity30 ' humanitarian release , including sending an envoy if appropriate			0
although he offered to go himself if that was the best option , aides say @entity77 assisted with the search to find a suitable envoy			0
in the end , the @entity5 are exacting the highest possible price they thought they could get for the release , securing what they see as the credibility a former leader of the free world can provide			0
last year , the @entity5 rejected several lower - level envoys before settling on @entity8 , who returned with the two @entity31 women after three hours of dining and photo - ops with @entity34			2
@entity2 's 1994 trip to @entity29 was successful in defusing the first @entity5 nuclear crisis , paving the way for the @entity110 in which @entity5 pledged to give up its nuclear weapons in return for aid			1
but it was also controversial because @entity2 reached a deal with @entity6 and announced it without checking with the @entity8 administration			0
@entity118 administration officials do n't expect a repeat performance but have kept mum about @entity2 's trip , saying only if such a mission took place it would be purely a " humanitarian effort			1
" the @entity31 wants to ensure the likely success of any effort to secure @entity30 ' release and does n't want to tie the mission to @entity31 's tensions with @entity5 over its nuclear program			1
those tensions have escalated in recent months with the sinking of the @entity135 warship @entity133 , which the international community has blamed on @entity29			0
while the @entity118 administration recognizes the @entity5 regime will likely use @entity2 's trip for propaganda purposes , officials say the most important thing is for @entity30 , whose health is deteriorating , to be released			1
they caution against any expectation of a breakthrough between the two countries , insisting there is no change in @entity31 policy toward @entity5			2
that policy has included tougher sanctions against @entity29 and joint @entity31 - @entity135 military exercises off the @entity5 coast			1
but @entity46 views @entity2 's trip as significant , as it comes at a time when negotiations between the @entity31 and @entity5 are at an impasse			1
@entity2 , he said , is not likely to succeed in obtaining @entity5 concessions on defense issues , but nevertheless , his trip could help influence public perceptions of @entity5 and eventually lead to direct dialog			1
" i think president @entity2 has a keen interest in reducing tensions on the [ @entity5 ] peninsula , " @entity46 said			2
@entity1 's @entity165 contributed to this report			0

@entity2 likely to repeat his 1994 *tactic* : give the @entity5 leader respect
a @entity2 trip to @entity29 has been in the works for weeks , professor says
restarting talks with the @entity31 is @entity5 's top goal , he says
