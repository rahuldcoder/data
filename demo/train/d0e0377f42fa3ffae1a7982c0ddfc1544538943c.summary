-- president @entity1 and @entity2 are set to make appearances beginning thursday at a major gathering of @entity6 officials and activists in @entity8 , a moment that campaign - weary @entity10 have awaited for weeks			1
@entity1 's strategists relish any chance to drive a wedge between @entity2 and @entity6 voters , and at the annual conference of the @entity16 , or @entity16 , the president is all - but - certain to paint @entity2 as beholden to anti-immigrant elements of his party 's conservative base			1
it 's an article of faith inside the @entity1 campaign 's @entity23 headquarters that the country 's shifting demographics -- particularly growing @entity6 communities that lean @entity10 in several swing states -- might be enough to put the election out of reach for @entity2 , no matter how sluggish the economy is			1
few locales will test that theory in november better than the host city for the @entity16 conference : @entity36 , ground zero for @entity8 's rapidly expanding @entity6 population			1
how can @entity39 attract voters other than old white men " the combination of demographics and the issue narrative in @entity36 could be the difference between 29 electoral votes or not , " said @entity42 , who managed @entity1 's winning 2008 campaign in @entity8			1
" it 's one of the areas where president @entity1 could grow from 2008			2
" until @entity1 's victory , @entity52 , home to @entity36 and @entity53 , had developed a well - earned reputation as one of @entity8 's premier battlegrounds			1
the county was decided by fewer than 6,000 votes in every presidential election going back to 1996			0
that all changed in 2008 , when @entity1 carried the county by 85,000 votes against @entity64			2
in april , @entity42 , who maintains a blog devoted to @entity67 political math that 's closely followed by operatives in both parties , began combing through @entity71 data and voter registration numbers in an effort to gauge whether @entity1 's @entity36 blowout in 2008 was an aberration or the new normal in @entity8 campaigns			1
his findings , outlined in a post titled " @entity79 , " underscore the @entity1 campaign 's demographics - as - destiny argument			2
defining the @entity36 metro area as @entity52 , @entity85 and @entity87 counties , @entity83 mapped out several unmistakably positive trends for @entity10 : â € ¢ the @entity36 area 's population jumped by 436,000 people between 2000 and 2010 , from 1.4 million residents to 1.85 million			2
african - americans and @entity94 , who tend to vote @entity10 , accounted for more than half of that growth			2
â € ¢ between october 2006 and january 2012 , the region added about 84,000 new voters and three quarters of those were @entity101 or @entity6			2
the vast majority of new voters registered as @entity10			2
over the same period , the share of the white vote in @entity36 increased by only 7 %			0
â € ¢ in 1994 , @entity39 accounted for 50 % of registered voters in the three sprawling counties surrounding @entity36			2
that number has now dropped to 33 %			0
at the same time , 41 % of @entity36 voters are now @entity10 , with the remainder not registering in either party			0
will @entity1 's immigration initiative sway @entity113 ? similar population changes are happening across @entity8			1
" the @entity10 ' lead among @entity6 voters has grown just in the last four years , " said @entity115 , associate director of the @entity116			1
latinos now comprise 13 % of the @entity8 electorate , up from 11 % in 2008			0
more latinos are now registered as @entity10 than as @entity39 , a reversal from previous election cycles			1
at first glance , those shifts may seem modest			0
but in a huge state where the race may come down to a few thousand votes , any mathematical edge matters greatly			0
the fluid nature of the state 's electorate is driven in large part by an influx of @entity94 -- who are eligible vote the moment they arrive because of @entity94 's status as a @entity139 territory -- along with growing @entity140 , @entity142 , @entity143 and @entity144 populations			1
@entity94 are now the second largest @entity6 group in the state after @entity147 , a @entity39 - leaning bloc that has seen its share of the statewide vote decline as other @entity6 communities grow at a faster clip			1
strategists in both parties say @entity8 's decade - long @entity6 boom is most visible around @entity36 , now the second - largest hub of @entity94 in the country outside of @entity158			1
neighborhoods like @entity160 , @entity161 and @entity162 , which hugs @entity163 , have become hot spots for @entity1 campaign organizers			0
among @entity8 's largest counties , @entity52 's @entity6 population grew by 83 % between 2000 and 2010 , according to the @entity116			1
@entity168 : avoid assumptions about @entity113 immigration status that 's faster than in @entity172 , @entity173 or @entity174 --- three huge and reliably @entity10 counties in south @entity8			1
courting the @entity94 vote in @entity36 is now an essential part of any @entity8 campaign itinerary , as vital as throwing back a shot of sugar - packed coffee in front of reporters at @entity183 in @entity172 's @entity184			1
" there is not a political visit in @entity36 that does n't include a stop at a @entity94 community center or gathering place , " said @entity185 , a @entity39 fundraiser and strategist from @entity172			2
the changing face of @entity36 has profound implications for the state 's political geography			0
in the modern era , @entity10 have won statewide races with robust turnout in @entity8			1
republicans usually rely on northern part of the state --- from @entity203 in the @entity204 to @entity205 in the east -- and on places like @entity208 and @entity209 along the @entity210			0
and slicing through the central part of the state is @entity213 , the highway connecting @entity215 to @entity36			0
the " @entity213 " has become a byword for the suburban midsection of the state where swing voters and transplants from the @entity221 often decide elections			0
opinion : what latinos want from candidates ? respect @entity215 , the state 's largest media market , continues to grow but retains much of its essential political character			0
meanwhile , the ballooning @entity94 population just 80 miles up the road has @entity36 looking , politically speaking , more and more like @entity8 -- a potential @entity10 stronghold in the heart of central @entity8 's political battlefield			1
both campaigns know what 's at stake			0
the @entity1 campaign and the @entity237 have opened multiple offices in @entity36 and are engaged in @entity6 voter contact efforts			1
underscoring the metro area 's importance , the @entity36 media market currently ranks second nationally in television ad spending from the campaigns and outside groups			0
roughly $ 10 million worth of ads have aired in @entity36 , including several @entity248 - language ads from the @entity1 campaign			0
@entity1 campaign hands in @entity23 and @entity8 are confident that the @entity39 's tough talk on immigration policy -- @entity2 has embraced elements of @entity255 's tough immigration law and said he would veto the @entity256 , for instance -- will push @entity8 's various @entity6 communities into the @entity10 fold in november			1
why older @entity113 matter in election @entity261 , a spokeswoman for the @entity1 campaign , also said @entity2 's opposition to the @entity264 confirmation of @entity265 , a @entity94 , will hurt him in @entity36			1
" @entity2 is on the wrong side of every issue important to @entity94 , " @entity261 said			0
" the community can not afford his insistence on repeating the failed economic policies that brought our economy to the brink of collapse , his belief that we should let foreclosures ' hit the bottom ' or his commitment to slashing our health care and education			0
" because of their citizenship status , @entity94 are not directly affected by the president 's decision last week to halt the deportation of young people who were brought to the country illegally			0
but @entity287 , an @entity1 campaign co-chair and organizer in @entity36 , said her fellow @entity94 feel a kinship with other @entity6 affected by the law			2
" we do gravitate to each other , " @entity287 told @entity0			0
" there 's a sense a loyalty we feel to other @entity6			2
at the same time , the campaign is doing well because that they have n't taken for granted that the @entity6 community is monolithic			0
" @entity39 accuse the @entity1 campaign of playing identity politics			2
they point to the sputtering economy as the primary issue for voters , regardless of ethnicity			0
' sleeping giant ' latino vote yet to awaken issues like homelessness and foreclosures continue to be pressing matters in central @entity8			2
" like in every other state , and like every other @entity101 , @entity6 in @entity8 are laser focused on the economy , " said @entity310 , the @entity237 's director of @entity6 outreach			1
" this administration tries to do a lot of things so they do n't have to talk about @entity1 's economic record			1
" @entity39 strategists also note that @entity94 are more independent than most political observers give them credit for			0
two @entity36 - area @entity94 leaders , for instance , are running in the @entity39 primary in the state 's newly drawn 9th @entity325			2
@entity327 , the @entity172 @entity39 fundraiser , said @entity329 , the state 's former @entity39 governor , won successive statewide races with an aggressive @entity94 outreach effort in central @entity8			1
" the @entity94 in @entity36 tend to lean @entity333 , " @entity327 said			0
" but they can definitely swing @entity39 with the right candidate and the right message			0
" to this day , @entity329 consistently calls on the @entity39 to temper its harsh tone on immigration reform , often to little effect			0
one leading @entity39 strategist who has worked on several recent high - profile races in the state said @entity39 have failed to grasp the political significance of the @entity8 's growing @entity6 population			1
" if you tried to take this current @entity39 brand onward for a generation , we would suffer greatly in @entity6 communities and we would face serious problems across the state , " said the strategist , who did not want to be identified criticizing his party			1
by the numbers : @entity6 voters			0

both @entity1 and @entity2 to speak to @entity6 officials and activists in @entity8
*hispanic* vote in @entity8 could tip balance in key battleground state
@entity10 ' lead among @entity8 *hispanic*s is growing , according to *research* center
@entity39 counter that @entity113 will vote on @entity1 's economic record
