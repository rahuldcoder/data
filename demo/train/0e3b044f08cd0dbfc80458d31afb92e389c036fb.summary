-- the @entity1 and @entity2 cut diplomatic ties during the 1979 hostage crisis , and relations between the two countries today can only be described as tense			1
but that did n't stop a sharp - shooting @entity1 basketball player from winding up his professional career in the @entity11 republic			1
@entity12 -- a six - foot point guard who competed internationally for 10 years after playing college ball -- was one of 13 @entity1 recruited by the @entity14 in the fall of 2008			1
he joined @entity2 's only non-government - sponsored team , in the cultural center of @entity18 , mostly " out of curiosity " -- and immediately fell in love with the country			1
" @entity2 was beautiful , " @entity12 said			1
" i saw something i 'd never really seen on the news , heard from people or read in the newspaper			2
" what he saw was the generosity of the people -- they treated him to dinners , took him on tours of historic landmarks and welcomed him , a non-muslim from the @entity33 , into their homes			0
a native of @entity36 in the @entity37 , @entity12 starred in both basketball and soccer for @entity40 in @entity41			1
he decided to pursue a professional basketball career overseas , excelling as a shooter and playmaker on teams from @entity46 and @entity47 to @entity48 and @entity49			2
he stunned family and friends when he decided to play in @entity2 , where he averaged 26 points a game and eight assists as the team captain			1
now retired from playing , his memories extend well beyond the basketball court			2
" sometimes you have to go out there and see it for yourself , " the 32 - year - old said			0
" i thought if it 's nice then i 'm going to see one of the best things a lot of people on this side of the world will never see			0
" @entity12 was taken aback with the level of admiration and respect @entity2 showed toward @entity1			1
despite being the highest - paid player , his teammates welcomed him , introducing @entity12 to their culture and hoping to benefit from his professionalism			1
" they brought me in as a brother , " @entity12 explains			1
" and my job was to teach them how to play the game the mental way			0
they had skills , they could dunk and guys could shoot , but they lacked mental discipline			0
" @entity12 says he taught his teammates how to prepare for games , watch film and learn from scouting reports			1
he quickly emerged as the undisputed star and captain of @entity18 ; regularly swarmed by young @entity2 fans for his autograph			1
every thursday , sell - out crowds jammed the gym , with more than 3,000 fans cheering , " @entity12 ! @entity12 ! " that first year in @entity2 , @entity12 , along with another import , @entity97 @entity96 , led their team to the playoffs for the first time			1
" i brought a sense of belief to them , " @entity12 recalled			1
" when i got there , they had no playoff aspirations			0
once we started winning , they realized we can do something special			0
" by this time , @entity1 filmmaker @entity111 , intrigued with @entity12 's @entity2 adventure , had begun shooting a documentary of his success with the team and how he was adapting to life in a faraway land			1
@entity111 and his @entity2 - @entity1 wife @entity118 said they were fascinated by the notion of an @entity1 playing basketball " in a land allegedly full of nukes " and enjoying every minute of it			1
in his initial conversations with the couple , @entity111 said , " he had us on the floor laughing			0
" " @entity118 and i looked at each other and said if he 's as clever and funny as he is on @entity131 then i 'll stay in @entity2 and we 'll make this film , " @entity111 said			1
but @entity12 , who also played for @entity133 in the @entity2 league until this year , had no idea he was about to become the star of what initially struck him as a 24/7 reality show			1
" i was starting to think this was like ' @entity140 , ' or some craziness , " he said			0
" i was like , man , i ai n't gon na do this			0
" but @entity111 and @entity118 hoped to make @entity12 's story much deeper than his basketball because he was breaking cultural barriers			1
for instance , @entity12 became close friends with three @entity2 women , rare in a country where the sexes are forbidden from interacting in public			1
the bonding began with @entity154 , the team physical therapist , and two friends who became @entity12 's translator and driver			2
the relationships gave @entity12 his first sense of human rights issues in @entity2 , especially the inequality between the sexes			1
" it was really bad for women			0
once i got to know some of the ladies it was so ... it was even worse , " he says			0
" most of the women are so highly educated and ca n't use it to their potential			0
" but the filmmakers insist their documentary -- " @entity174 " -- is not meant to be a heavy - handed political documentary on a @entity177 country fighting for its freedom			2
they felt that @entity12 's witty personality attracts colorful characters that bring playfulness and humor to an unusual story			2
" through sports we wanted to get into a society that is often misrepresented and misunderstood , " @entity111 said			0
" @entity12 had the same perception about these places as many @entity1 ; he just goes there and shatters them			1
" @entity111 continued filming the discussions and cultural exchanges @entity12 encountered both on and off court , but as the 2009 presidential elections and violent street protests took hold , it became increasingly difficult to gather footage of him on the streets of @entity201			2
working as a one - man band , @entity111 found himself filming non-stop for three to four hours at a time			0
with nothing but a backpack and endless tapes , he was extra cautious not to attract attention , often trying to blend in as a tourist			0
he would mail footage to his mother in @entity210 who would send it to his wife in @entity213 -- in one case , 90 hours ' worth			0
" i mailed 80 tapes and kept the 10 i felt had the biggest nuggets with myself , " @entity111 says			0
" i hid them in my underwear and socks out of fear			0
" that was the scariest time for me because i knew that was great footage			0
i knew this was potentially a really good film if it ever gets to @entity1			1
" @entity111 , who had been denied a journalist 's visa , freely traveled in and out of the country before his last planned trip near the end of the basketball season			2
shortly before the june elections he was detained in @entity2			2
he spent 24 hours in confinement before being sent back to the @entity1 with no explanation			2
on the basketball court , @entity12 was unfazed by the street protests			1
however , off court he found himself enmeshed in the tangle of politics , current affairs and sports			0
" i could see it on my teammates ' faces , " he said			0
" their relatives were being hurt and kidnapped			0
that 's when it really hit me that this thing is real , and i just could n't escape it			0
" @entity12 is now focusing on his after - school education program mentoring children in the @entity37			2
the most talented are given the opportunity to meet basketball scouts in hopes of one day following in his footsteps			2
while still interested in visiting his friends back in @entity2 , he admits that might be difficult			2
" after this documentary is released , i do n't think i will want to go back -- they 'll lock me up ! "			0

@entity1 @entity12 played basketball in @entity2 from 2008
his experiences were documented in a film called " @entity174 "
@entity12 says he was *surprised* by the friendly welcome he received
but he also experienced the *downsides* of life in the @entity11 republic
