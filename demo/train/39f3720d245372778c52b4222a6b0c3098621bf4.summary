-- my heart goes out to @entity3 , who is dying of brain cancer and who wrote last week about her desire for what is often referred to as " death with dignity			0
" yet while i have every sympathy for her situation , it is important to remember that for every case such as this , there are hundreds -- or thousands -- more people who could be significantly harmed if assisted suicide is legal			1
the legalization of assisted suicide always appears acceptable when the focus is solely on an individual			1
but it is important to remember that doing so would have repercussions across all of society , and would put many people at risk of immense harm			0
after all , not every terminal prognosis is correct , and not everyone has a loving husband , family or support system			0
as an advocate working on behalf of disability rights for 37 years , and as someone who uses a wheelchair , i am all too familiar with the explicit and implicit pressures faced by people living with chronic or serious disability or disease			0
but the reality is that legalizing assisted suicide is a deadly mix with the broken , profit - driven health care system we have in the @entity47			1
at less than $ 300 , assisted suicide is , to put it bluntly , the cheapest treatment for a terminal illness			1
this means that in places where assisted suicide is legal , coercion is not even necessary			1
if life - sustaining expensive treatment is denied or even merely delayed , patients will be steered toward assisted suicide , where it is legal			1
this problem applies to government - funded health care as well			1
in 2008 , came the story that @entity61 , a @entity62 , @entity63 , woman diagnosed with lung cancer and prescribed a chemotherapy drug by her personal physician , had reportedly received a letter from the @entity68 stating that her chemotherapy treatment would not be covered			0
she said she was told that instead , they would pay for , among other things , her assisted suicide			2
" to say to someone : " we 'll pay for you to die , but not for you to live " -- it 's cruel , " she said			0
another @entity63 resident , 53 - year - old @entity77 , was diagnosed with prostate cancer			0
like @entity79 , @entity77 was reportedly denied approval of his prescribed chemotherapy treatment and instead offered coverage for assisted suicide			2
meanwhile , where assisted suicide is legal , an heir or abusive caregiver may steer someone towards assisted suicide , witness the request , pick up the lethal dose , and even give the drug -- no witnesses are required at the death , so who would know ? this can occur despite the fact that diagnoses of terminal illness are often wrong , leading people to give up on treatment and lose good years of their lives			1
true , " safeguards " have been put in place where assisted suicide is legal			1
but in practical terms , they provide no protection			0
for example , people with a history of depression and suicide attempts have received the lethal drugs			0
@entity111 of @entity63 reportedly had a 40 - year history of significant depression , yet he received lethal drugs in @entity63			0
these risks are simply not worth the price of assisted suicide			2
available data suggests that pain is rarely the reason why people choose assisted suicide			2
instead , most people do so because they fear burdening their families or becoming disabled or dependent			0
anyone dying in discomfort that is not otherwise relievable , may legally today , in all 50 states , receive palliative sedation , wherein the patient is sedated to the point at which the discomfort is relieved while the dying process takes place peacefully			0
this means that today there is a legal solution to painful and uncomfortable deaths , one that does not raise the very serious problems of legalizing assisted suicide			1
the debate about assisted suicide is not new , but voters and elected officials grow very wary of it when they learn the facts			2
just this year alone , assisted suicide bills were rejected in @entity143 , @entity144 , and @entity145 , and stalled in @entity146 , due to bipartisan , grassroots opposition from a broad coalition of groups spanning the political spectrum from left to right , including disability rights organizations , medical professionals and associations , palliative care specialists , hospice workers and faith - based organizations			1
assisted suicide is a unique issue that breaks down ideological boundaries and requires us to consider those potentially most vulnerable in our society			2
all this means that we should , as a society , strive for better options to address the fear and uncertainty articulated by @entity3			0
but if assisted suicide is legal , some people 's lives will be ended without their consent , through mistakes and abuse			1
no safeguards have ever been enacted or proposed that can properly prevent this outcome , one that can never be undone			0
ultimately , when looking at the bigger picture , and not just individual cases , one thing becomes clear : any benefits from assisted suicide are simply not worth the real and significant risks of this dangerous public policy .			1

legal assisted suicide can seem acceptable on individual basis , says @entity184
but in a profit - driven health care system like the @entity47 it can be dangerous , @entity186 says
diagnoses of terminal illness are often wrong , writes @entity186
