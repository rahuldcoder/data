-- an otherwise lazy sunday suddenly morphed into a manic @entity1 day			0
at 2 p.m. november 20 , the @entity3 ' public - relations staff was informed that the world 's most famous hockey player -- who had not played in 319 days on account of the world 's most famous concussion -- planned to lace up his skates 29 hours later against the @entity10			1
at 3 p.m. , the @entity3 broke the news on their website under the memorably modest headline " @entity14 returns to lineup monday			1
" file that one as the sports equivalent to " @entity16			2
" at 3:01 , the sports universe began to respond with the sort of urgency only a transcendent athlete could trigger			2
and make no mistake , the @entity22 has only one transcendent athlete , one man who could move mountains ( or at least television trucks and vacationing sports writers ) on a moment 's notice			1
@entity31 hockey writer @entity30 was relaxing at a @entity33 game with his wife when the call came			2
he immediately made plans to cover the event			0
" i 'd already told my bosses , ' if @entity14 comes back , i 'm coming off vacation , ' " @entity30 said			1
" i just thought , ' it 's such a major story for our league			2
' " he was n't the only one			0
by the next afternoon , a @entity47 - sized fleet of seven tv trucks ( there are normally two ) had found their way to the loading docks outside @entity3 's @entity52			1
no fewer than 251 media credentials had been issued			0
all three major @entity55 tv networks made the trip			0
even @entity57 -- which relinquished its @entity22 rights several years ago -- sent reporters to the scene and broke into programming with live updates all day			0
" @entity57 doing live hourly updates from an @entity22 arena in november ? it just does n't happen , " said @entity65 , the @entity3 ' senior vice president of communications			1
watch highlights of @entity14 's return yeah , @entity14 is that big a deal			1
he has n't made the @entity22 must - watch tv in the @entity71 -- even @entity72 could n't do that -- but his impact is undeniable			0
he came along at precisely the right time , as the @entity22 emerged from its year - long lockout in 2005 , and immediately established himself as the sport 's marquee name			1
" he 's the best player in the world , " said television analyst @entity79 , a longtime @entity22 player			2
" if i 'm going to turn on a hockey game , the first game i 'm going to watch is one where @entity14 is playing			1
" @entity14 , 24 , has transformed @entity3 into the @entity22 's @entity71 leader in local tv ratings and its overall leader in merchandise sales			1
he has personally led the league in jersey sales for six straight seasons , according to the @entity91 , while winning a @entity47 and scoring an @entity93 - winning goal for @entity94 in 2010			1
@entity14 's return enthralled @entity3 fans , who have sold out 223 consecutive games			1
the @entity98 -- before @entity14 -- were on the verge of being sold and relocated			1
last in the league in attendance			0
everything changed when the team won the ' 05 draft lottery , on a 6.25 % chance , and the right to draft " @entity107			0
" the hype preceding his arrival was unprecedented			0
" it 's hard for outsiders to understand how much @entity14 means to the city , " said @entity116 , who chronicled the team 's rebirth in the recently released best - selling book " @entity120			1
" " without him , the @entity3 in all likelihood would n't be here			1
they would be in @entity122 , @entity123 or some other city			0
" nobody needs to recount the story to @entity3 president @entity127 , a @entity3 native who grew up rooting for the team			1
@entity127 points out that the @entity3 ' local tv ratings have rocketed from a pitiful average of 1.5 to well into the 8 's since @entity14 arrived six years ago			1
the team 's season - ticket waiting list now exceeds 9,000			2
" what @entity1 means to the city is not just what he does on ice but the type of person he is , " @entity127 said			0
" it 's his youth and energy			2
he 's taken what @entity141 ( @entity142 , hockey legend and team owner ) built to a whole new level			1
it has allowed us to build our brand in a way that has made @entity3 a hockey town			1
" the town exploded when @entity14 scored on vintage backhander just 5 minutes , 24 seconds into his return game			1
he unintentionally punctuated his celebration with a joyous and easy - to - decipher profanity			0
" hopefully , " @entity14 said , " everyone was n't reading lips at home			1
" rest assured , they were , and they wo n't soon forget the kind of where - were - you moment rarely seen at a regular - season sporting event			0
calls came fast and furious to the local sports radio station , 93.7 @entity167 , the next day as people relived @entity14 's goal			1
a man claimed that his wife jumped on the couch and simultaneously yelled the exact phrase @entity14 was mouthing on the ice			1
@entity14 finished with two goals and two assists in a 5 - 0 victory			1
his return evoked memories of @entity142 emerging from a three - year retirement in 2000 to star in a 5 - 0 victory over the @entity184			2
si on @entity14 's return @entity14 has n't scored a goal since , but he easily leads the @entity22 in points per game ( 1.83 ) with 11 in six games			1
he has vaulted from nowhere to fourth among forwards in all - star votes			2
the @entity3 are 4 - 1 - 1 since his return and are averaging better than a half - goal more per game			2
but the larger story is @entity14 's recovery			1
concussions are a hot - button topic in the @entity22 and @entity198 these days			0
unaware that he might have been concussed , @entity14 initially returned to the lineup only five days after absorbing a head shot from then - @entity201 forward @entity202 at january 's @entity203			1
he sustained another head hit in his next game			0
after that , @entity14 was determined to heal fully			2
his advice to other athletes : " i would n't come back until you 're 100 %			2
that 's my advice , and however long it takes , it 's worth the wait , making sure you listen to your body			0
" @entity14 faced mounting criticism for not returning sooner			2
he bucked the sporting culture that says , " shake it off			0
" his respect for the recovery process could become a significant piece of his legacy , depending on how his comeback plays out			0
" i do think the way this went down , the way it was managed and the outcome we 've had so far , could change the culture of concussion management , " said dr. @entity223 , who began treating @entity14 in january			1
" it 's the most powerful case i 've ever been involved in			0
" @entity223 is director of the @entity232 , the nation 's busiest clinical practice for sports - related concussions			2
he sees thousands of patients each year , from elementary school athletes to professional stars			2
he treated @entity240 quarterback @entity239 after @entity239 sustained a concussion while at the @entity242			0
@entity14 's injury was more severe			1
" i heard from @entity198 players , @entity246 players , soccer players , they were all interested in how this went , " @entity223 said			0
" it was unlike with any athlete i 've seen			0
all eyes were on @entity1 going through this			0
i 'm talking about parents , kids , pro athletes , community members , friends			0
kids would tell me they felt a ray of hope with someone like him going though it , too			0
" i hope it sends a message that this injury does have to be managed very carefully , and that if managed effectively , you can prevent bad outcomes			0
" @entity223 , who along with @entity3 team physician @entity268 cleared @entity14 to return , wo n't soon forget the comeback game			1
" i felt an incredible sense of pride , " @entity223 said			0
" i did n't feel nervous			0
" by the end of the night , everybody felt good			0
better than good , actually			0
