@entity0 -- the defense anesthesiology expert in the trial of @entity5 's doctor was found in contempt of court wednesday for referring to his private talks with dr. @entity9 during his testimony			1
dr. @entity9 did not testify in his own defense in his involuntary manslaughter trial and the judge refused to allow dr. @entity15 to base any of his testimony on anything other than what @entity9 told police			1
@entity21 judge @entity20 gave dr. white 30 days to pay a $ 250 fine , but he also dropped a second contempt citation for derogatory comments he allegedly made about a rival witness			1
wednesday 's contempt hearing was part of the aftermath of dr. @entity9 's involuntary manslaughter that ended with a guilty verdict last week			1
another contempt hearing is set for november 29 , the day @entity9 is set to be sentenced , for one of the defense lawyers who allegedly violated the judge 's gag order by speaking to @entity38 's " @entity37 " during the trial			1
@entity9 defense lawyer @entity40 , who was in court to defend dr. white wednesday , said after the hearing that he believed @entity9 should be eligible for early release if he is given prison time			1
a @entity47 law that took effect last month provides for non-violent state inmates to be assigned to county jails to relieve state prison overcrowding			0
the @entity53 jail has a court - ordered early release program to relieve overcrowding , which allows non-violent offenders to serve much of their sentences at home with electronic monitoring			2
@entity40 said @entity9 is not a safety threat to the public and should be included in the early release program			1
dr. @entity15 told reporters after the hearing that he still believed @entity5 gave himself the overdose of the surgical anesthetic propofol and a sedative the coroner ruled killed the pop icon			2
" i was aware that @entity5 had self - administered drugs in the past , propofol specifically , and so what 's to say that he would n't do it again , " @entity15 said			0
@entity9 was withholding from him the drug that he desperately desired			0
" @entity15 , while under cross-examination by deputy district attorney @entity77 , referred several times to his private discussions with dr. @entity9 about what happened the day @entity5 died			1
judge @entity20 repeatedly warned him not to do so			0
finally , the judge cited @entity15 for contempt and set wednesday 's hearing to decide if he would be fined			2
" there was n't any intentional deception here or violation of the court order , " defense lawyer @entity40 told pastor wednesday			2
" he was explaining to mr. @entity77 ' hey , i ca n't answer that			0
' " prosecutor @entity77 , who has grown a beard since the televised trial ended , told the judge that this was one of " multiple instances " where dr. @entity15 was " trying to sabotage the trial			1
" " it was intentional and deliberate , " @entity77 said			0
" it was an attempt to deny the people a fair trial			0
" @entity15 told the judge he " did my best as i was admonished by you to answer question truthfully and as completely as i could			0
" " i apologize profusely if i disrespected you , " @entity15 said			0
" i learned a lot from this experience			0
" pastor ruled that @entity15 was guilty of violating his order by giving " a non-responsive answer " that dealt with " no - go territory			0
" while he could have fined him $ 1,000 , he only imposed a $ 250 fine			2
judge @entity20 also dropped the other contempt charge which stemmed from an online report that quoted @entity15 allegedly calling prosecution anesthesiology expert dr. @entity122 " a scumbag			1
