@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity1 @entity3 forcefully denied reports monday that their leader is dead , dismissing them as " claims and rumors " from the " @entity0 stooge regime 's intelligence directorate			1
" mullah @entity15 " is alive and well and is leading the @entity11 in all aspects while living safely with reliance on @entity14 , " spokesman @entity10 said			1
his statement came after suggestions that @entity15 might have been killed recently			0
a spokesman for @entity1 's intelligence agency , the @entity19 , said monday that @entity15 has disappeared in the past five days			1
@entity20 said he " hopes " @entity15 is dead but can not confirm it			1
" so far , we can not confirm the death or killing of @entity15 officially			1
but we can confirm that he has been disappeared from his hideout in @entity27 , @entity28 " in @entity29 , he said			2
" our sources and senior @entity3 members confirm that they ca n't contact him , " @entity20 said , adding that @entity15 had been living in @entity27 for 10 years			1
@entity3 spokesman @entity10 said they " strongly reject these false claims of the enemy " and urged " our fellow countrymen , @entity11 and the rest of the @entity39 not to believe these intelligence lies and false reports			1
" @entity29 's @entity42 also denied that @entity15 was dead , saying in a news conference that the claims were " baseless			1
" an official with the @entity47 - led @entity46 told @entity2 there was no indication the rumor was true			1
a former top @entity29 intelligence official called the reports " nonsense " and " disinformation , " but then said he had no idea whether the @entity3 leader is alive or dead			1
" how should i know ? i 'm not concerned with it , " gen. @entity56 said on @entity58 television			0
the original news report suggesting monday that @entity15 was dead , by @entity1 's @entity61 , quoted @entity19 spokesman @entity62 as saying that @entity56 was moving him when he was killed			1
" am i supposed to be transporting him from @entity27 to @entity64 ? it 's nonsense , " he said by telephone from @entity67			0
@entity29 's @entity70 intelligence agency is thought to have had strong links with the @entity1 @entity3 over the years			1
@entity15 was a rural @entity72 cleric when became a leader of a group of students -- or " taliban " -- who took over @entity1 in the early 1990s and established a hard - line islamic fundamentalist regime that gave shelter to @entity78 and his @entity80 terrorist network			1
@entity82 killed @entity78 on may 2 in @entity29 , nearly a decade after the september 11 , 2001 , attacks on the @entity84 and the @entity85			0
the @entity86 led an invasion of @entity1 soon after the attacks , toppling @entity15 's @entity3 and sending @entity78 into hiding			1
the reclusive @entity15 refused to be photographed or filmed and rarely traveled			0
he infrequently gave interviews and was thought to have met only two non-muslims in recent years			0
nonetheless what @entity15 said passed as law when the @entity3 ruled @entity1 , and to challenge him was unknown			1
the " commander of the faithful , " as he had become known , created the @entity3 in the early 1990s and was their spiritual guide			0
those who had met him said he cast an imposing figure -- bearded with a black turban and one eye stitched shut ; the result of a wound sustained during a gunfight with @entity104 troops during their occupation of @entity1			0
in the wake of the @entity104 withdrawal , @entity15 created the @entity3 to overcome what he saw as @entity1 's descent into a lawlessness landscape dominated by warlords			1
his recruits came from the @entity72 schools within @entity1 and in the @entity1 refugee camps across the border in @entity29			2
driven largely by faith , they swept across the country			0
before the final assault on @entity0 in 1996 , @entity15 entered @entity120 's grand mosque and took out a rarely seen holy cloth thought once to have been carried by the @entity122			2
waving it from a rooftop he received an ecstatic response from his @entity3 foot soldiers			0
inspired by religious fervor , they moved on to take @entity0 within a matter of days , bolstering @entity15 's belief in his spiritual destiny			1
with most of the country under @entity3 control , he set himself the goal of transforming @entity1 into the purest @entity72 state in the world , declaring himself @entity137 , or head of the @entity39			2
while many ordinary @entity1 disagreed with his hardline interpretation of @entity72 , others were willing to endure the @entity3 's excesses in exchange for the relative peace they brought to the territory they controlled			1
in building the perfect @entity72 state , though , he had little regard for the concerns of the outside world			0
public executions and amputations were common and the @entity3 's treatment of women attracted much international condemnation			2
in 2001 , he rejected pressure from around the world -- including from many @entity39 countries -- not to go ahead with plans to demolish two ancient statues of the @entity158 carved into cliffs near the town of @entity161			0
the statues , described by many as world - class cultural relics , were blown to bits			0
@entity15 dismissed the global outcry , saying the statues ' destruction was merely " breaking stones			0
" @entity15 vanished after a @entity86 - led coalition booted the @entity3 and its leaders from power in @entity1 in december 2001 for refusing to hand over @entity78 after the 9/11 terror attacks			1
his appearance remained a mystery to many , and that presented a challenge to those on his trail , according to @entity1 president @entity180			0
" if i come across him tomorrow in the streets of @entity0 or @entity120 or @entity183 or @entity184 in @entity1 , i would not recognize him , " @entity180 told @entity2 in 2003			0
" how would you arrest someone that you do n't know how he looks ? " the @entity3 , citing ultra-orthodox views of @entity72 , outlawed photographs of people , saying making any image of a human being was forbidden by the @entity193			0
but intelligence agencies argued that another key purpose of that move was this : if the leaders of the @entity3 could keep anyone from taking their pictures , it would be very hard to track them down or prove they were the men in charge during the @entity3 's most brutal and repressive days			2
the @entity86 government offered a reward of up to $ 10 million for information leading to his capture			0
many in the @entity86 intelligence community believed he was holed up in or near @entity27 , a city of 1 million people that is the capital of @entity212 in southwestern @entity29			2
@entity29 has consistently dismissed those claims			2
occasionally , the elusive leader would release a written message to reiterate that the @entity3 had not given up its fight to regain control of @entity1 from @entity86 and @entity47 troops			2
the battle " is forging ahead like a powerful flood " and " is approaching the edge of victory , " said one such online message in 2009			0
@entity2 's @entity225 , @entity226 , @entity227 and @entity228 and journalist @entity229 contributed to this report .			0

" we hope he is dead but we can not confirm it , " an @entity1 intelligence spokesman says
@entity29 's interior minister rejects the reports
an @entity46 official says there is no indication it is true
the @entity1 @entity3 reject " false claims " of @entity15 's death , saying he is alive and well
