-- @entity2 's military occupation of @entity4 territory on the @entity6 peninsula constitutes a blatant violation of the commitments that @entity9 undertook in the @entity10 for @entity4			1
the @entity11 and @entity12 , the other two signatories , now have an obligation to support @entity4 and penalize @entity2			1
when the @entity15 collapsed in 1991 , @entity4 found itself holding the world 's third largest nuclear arsenal , including some 1,900 strategic nuclear warheads that had been designed to attack the @entity11			1
working in a trilateral dialogue with @entity4 and @entity2 negotiators , @entity11 diplomats helped to broker a deal — the january 1994 @entity23 — under which @entity4 agreed to transfer all of the strategic nuclear warheads to @entity2 for elimination and to dismantle all of the strategic delivery systems on its territory			1
@entity29 did this on the condition that it receive security guarantees or assurances			0
the @entity34 , signed on december 5 , 1994 , by the leaders of @entity4 , @entity2 , the @entity11 and the @entity12 ( the latter three being the depositary states of the @entity37 , that is , the states that receive the accession documents of other countries that join the treaty ) ) laid out a set of assurances for @entity4			1
these included commitments to respect @entity4 's independence , sovereignty and existing borders ; to refrain from the threat or use of force against @entity4 's territorial integrity and independence ; and to refrain from economic coercion against @entity4			1
@entity55 , @entity56 : @entity57 must act quickly to punish @entity58 the memorandum bundled together a set of assurances that @entity4 already held from the @entity62 ( @entity62 ) @entity63 , @entity64 and @entity37			2
the @entity4 government nevertheless found it politically valuable to have these assurances in a @entity4 - specific document			2
words matter , and a big question at the time arose over whether to use the term " guarantees " or " assurances " in the memorandum			0
the @entity11 provides guarantees to allies , such as @entity76 member states ; the term implies a military commitment			2
in the early 1990s , neither the @entity79 administration nor the @entity81 administration was prepared to extend a military commitment to @entity4 — and both felt that , even if they wanted to , the @entity84 would not produce the needed two - thirds vote for consent to ratification of such a treaty			2
the @entity34 thus was negotiated as a political agreement			2
it refers to assurances , not defined , but less than a military guarantee			0
@entity11 negotiators — myself among them — discussed this point in detail with @entity4 counterparts so that there would be no misunderstanding			1
what is taking place today in @entity6 can only be described as a @entity2 military occupation			2
the @entity2 @entity103 and its associated units have had bases in @entity6 since 1991 , by agreement with @entity4			1
but the agreement does not allow for the @entity2 military , which has poured thousands of additional troops onto the peninsula over the past several days , to take control of @entity6			2
opinion : @entity58 's @entity113 endgame these @entity2 actions are in blatant violation of the @entity34 , as well as @entity2 's commitments under the @entity117 and a 1997 bilateral @entity4 - @entity2 treaty			1
as signatories , the @entity11 and @entity12 have an obligation to respond , even if they are not obligated to respond with military force			1
@entity123 and @entity124 should act in two ways			0
first , they should work with other @entity128 member states to support @entity4			1
that means political engagement , such as secretary of state @entity132 's visit today to @entity29			0
they should also assemble a financial package with the @entity135 to extend credits to @entity4			0
that can give the country some breathing room as it undertakes critical reforms to put its economic house in order			0
@entity143 , @entity123 and @entity124 should work with the @entity128 and others to impose political , diplomatic and economic sanctions on @entity9 unless and until @entity2 ceases its violation of @entity4 's sovereignty and territorial integrity			1
on sunday , the @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity150 , @entity151 , @entity152 , @entity153 and @entity154 announced they were suspending preparations to take part in the @entity158 to be hosted in june in @entity159 by @entity2 president @entity58			1
other steps have been taken , and still others are being planned			0
the @entity162 should aim to impose significant costs on @entity2 that will lead @entity58 to rethink his actions			1
that likely will prove difficult , but there can be no business as usual with @entity9			0
opinion : how @entity58 carries out power grab a strong response is important for settling @entity4 's current crisis			0
it also matters for the cause of nuclear nonproliferation			0
security assurances were key to bringing @entity29 to agree to get rid of its nuclear arms			0
if @entity123 and @entity124 do not stand by the @entity34 now , it would discredit the idea of such assurances			0
that would be unfortunate , as security assurances could play a role in defusing nuclear proliferation cases , such as @entity185			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity188 .			0

@entity188 : in @entity4 occupation , @entity2 **reneging** on 1994 deal to leave it alone
@entity34 let @entity4 shed nukes in *exchange* for its sovereignty , he says
@entity11 , @entity2 , @entity12 , @entity4 signed . @entity2 now **reneging** . @entity162 must penalize it , he says
@entity188 : *failure* to support @entity4 could *delegitimize* *future* nuke deals , like with @entity185
