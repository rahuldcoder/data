@entity0 -- more than half the public says @entity3 has helped either their families or others across the country , although less than one in five @entity8 say they have personally benefited from the health care law , according to a new national poll			1
a @entity1 / @entity12 survey also indicates that a majority of @entity8 oppose the @entity3 , but some of that opposition is from people who do n't think the law goes far enough			1
the poll , conducted this past weekend , was released on wednesday , one day after a federal appeals court upheld @entity3 tax subsidies			1
that ruling came just a couple of hours after a separate appeals court struck down such subsidies for the millions of @entity8 enrolled in the federal government 's @entity26 exchange			2
according to the poll , only 18 % of the public say they or their families are better off now that the major provisions of the health care law have been implemented			2
another 35 % report that , while their lives have not improved , the @entity3 has benefited other people in the @entity8			1
add those two numbers together and that means 53 % say that @entity3 has helped either their families or others across the country			1
forty - four percent tell us that the health care law has not helped anyone in the country			0
according to the poll , 40 % of @entity8 say they support the health care law , basically unchanged from march but up from 35 % in december , which was a record low in @entity1 polling			2
fifty - nine percent of those questioned say they oppose the measure , down five points from december			0
" not all of the opposition to the health care law comes from the right , " said @entity1 polling director @entity54			0
" thirty - eight percent say they oppose the law because it 's too liberal , but 17 % say they oppose it because it 's not liberal enough			0
that means more than half the public either favors @entity3 , or opposes it because it does n't go far enough			1
" as expected , the poll indicates a continued wide partisan divide between @entity67 and @entity68 over the law and whether it 's working			2
political battle over @entity3 the measure was passed into law in 2010 , when the @entity67 controlled both houses of @entity74			0
the law , considered president @entity77 's signature domestic achievement , was a major issue in 2010 and 2012 , and is again in 2014 , as many @entity68 continue to call for @entity3 to be repealed and replaced			1
while the @entity3 website suffered a disastrous rollout last autumn , things have improved			0
major flaws with @entity26 were addressed and major gains in enrollment were made			0
but @entity68 continue to keep their midterm campaign focus on the health care law			1
earlier this month house speaker @entity87 made @entity3 the focus of his lawsuit against the president			2
the @entity68 obsession with the health care law may be smart politics : midterm electorates are smaller than those of presidential elections , and the contests are often all about getting out base voters -- and the @entity68 base continues to hate @entity3			1
the poll was conducted for @entity1 by @entity12 from july 18 - 20 , with 1,012 adult americans questioned by telephone			0
the survey 's overall sampling error is plus or minus three percentage points			0
