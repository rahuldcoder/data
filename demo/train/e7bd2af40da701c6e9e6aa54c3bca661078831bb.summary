-- verrry scary things as we approached @entity3 : 1			1
it was a dark and bone - chilling night in @entity8 , @entity9			2
a game of baseball was to be played -- a spine - tingly , goose - bumpy game , game 6 of the @entity14 , in a park fenced in by a @entity16 -- and the visiting @entity17 had a particularly petrifying sight to face on @entity3 eve when , one by one , those wolfman - hairy @entity19 came to bat : " @entity6			1
) @entity24 , as scary as the walking dead			0
up to the plate he stepped , 6 feet 4 , 250 pounds , lugging a huge wooden club			1
a cardinal or two on the front of a @entity17 player 's shirt must have flown away in fear			1
the rest of the @entity19 were eerie enough , with those demented - farmer - from - a - horror - film faces of theirs			1
yet it was not the dark whiskers of @entity6 that were intimidating to anybody			1
that dangerous , deadly , pitcher 's - bloodsucking bat			2
sure enough , they tried to take that bat out of @entity6 's huge hands			1
they walked him ... and walked him ... and walked him ...			0
four times , three of them intentional , but all for naught because the @entity19 took @entity51 6 anyway , 6 - 1 , to claim the @entity52 as their own on the green grass of home			1
he came to wednesday night 's game hitting .733			2
not even .533 , which would have been a fairly surreal bat stat. @entity57 known in @entity58 to all as " @entity6 " already had 11 hits in 15 official times at bat in this @entity52 , a fiendishly good , sell - your - soul batting average of .733			1
which is kind of like playing 18 holes of golf and getting birdies on 14 or 15 of them			2
once when he did n't get on base , he walloped a ball to @entity72 's right - field wall that required a fence - banging , rib - bruising catch on the part of the @entity17 ' @entity76 to prevent it from being a grand slam home run			1
scary good , this guy has been			0
( a banshee 's cry			0
) on the opposite wall of @entity8 's ancient park , the intimidatingly high left - field one nicknamed the " @entity16 , " ghosts inside probably were cackling in delight whenever @entity6 lurched up to home plate			1
wednesday 's game needed to be won by the visitors from @entity91 to stay alive			2
they must have felt @entity72 's old walls closing in on them , like anxious villagers finding themselves trapped by @entity96 under a dome			0
@entity17 came armed with a strong team and a splendid pitching staff			1
yet it had to at least consider the possibility of not having a pitcher throw a single pitch to @entity6			1
at least not one he could hit			0
wait ... you mean walk @entity6 on purpose every time up , no matter what ? it might beat getting beat by his bat			1
" i remember them doing it to @entity116 , " the former big - league outfielder @entity110 said when i touched base with him before wednesday 's game			2
september 2 , 1970 : @entity117 vs. @entity118			0
the manager of the visiting team , @entity121 , had a dread of seeing 6 - foot - 7 , 255 - pound @entity116 stride toward the plate			2
" he 's the monster man in baseball , " @entity121 once said of him			0
" i never saw any man feared like this			0
" so , he intentionally walked @entity116 time after time			0
he made pitcher @entity129 walk him in the first inning			2
( @entity110 batted next and made an out			0
) walked him in the third inning , even though @entity116 was the first man up			0
) walked him in the fifth , again with none on base and none out			0
( @entity110 singled , then @entity116 scored on a wild pitch			0
sixth inning , two senators on base , @entity116 up , so the @entity117 manager decided to finally risk pitching to him			0
he told @entity129 to go from the mound to first base			0
he brought in the great @entity145 just to pitch to @entity146 , who promptly made @entity121 regret it with a base hit			0
@entity110 then knocked in a run and @entity150 won the game			2
would you walk the @entity19 's red - hot @entity6 every time at bat ? " every at - bat , i would not , " @entity110 told me			1
" but depending on the situation , it could be automatic			0
" this is the kind of fear that @entity159 struck in his foes			0
bonds was walked intentionally a whopping 120 times in the 2004 season alone			2
yet to opposing managers , it felt more logical than letting @entity161 have a chance to belt a home run			0
@entity168 refused to let @entity169 hit after being burned by him once too often			0
" anytime i 've got first base open , " @entity168 said in the ' 80s when he was managing the @entity176 , " that 's where he 's going			0
" walk him even with the bases full ? " you bet , " @entity168 said			2
" that 's the way they pitched @entity181			0
i 'll take my chances with whoever 's on deck			0
" ah , @entity181 ... the scariest @entity19 of them all			1
@entity186 of the @entity187 was once walked deliberately by @entity168 four times in a game , whereupon he yelled to @entity190 in the dugout : " who do you think i am , @entity181 ? " hmmm , maybe the specter of @entity181 was there a-haunting @entity72 as well , watching over @entity6 as the @entity19 went out hunting for the ultimate @entity3 treat			1
the way that @entity6 had been hitting in this @entity52 , you could definitely describe it as @entity199			1
@entity6 , unlike the man once nicknamed the @entity181 , is a baseball slugger in an era when many fans have become suspicious of a hitter 's success			1
is his prowess the result of hard work and legitimate talent or are more sinister methods involved : a secret formula from a @entity212 - like laboratory , perhaps ? @entity214 , but almost nobody seems to speculate that a banned steroid has ever passed through @entity6 's flesh and veins			1
he seems immune to suspicion , possibly due to his always being a man of considerable size , big arms , big trunk , big head , and not some 170 - pound beanpole who transformed into a baseball - crushing beast			2
" they pick me ( to be drug - tested ) every time , i do n't know why , " @entity6 said a few years ago with a bemused shrug			1
" all i know is all they are going to find is a lot of rice and beans			0
" he came to @entity3 eve looking to torment and haunt everyone from @entity17 to the very end			1
) the @entity17 , well , they were looking to do whatever it took , short of garlic or a stake to the heart , to fend off @entity72 's scary bat			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity246 .			1

@entity246 : @entity6 may have been the scariest thing to face @entity17 this @entity3
" @entity6 " was *awesome* at the plate : 11 hits in 15 official times at bat before @entity51
@entity246 : @entity17 had to walk @entity6 four times in the final game ; they lost anyway
@entity19 claimed the *series* as their own in large part due to @entity6 , @entity246 says
