-- a paramedic who responded to a horrific , deadly fertilizer plant explosion in @entity5 , @entity6 -- and who later spoke at a memorial for its victims -- was sentenced to 21 months in federal prison for conspiring to make a pipe bomb , a prosecutor 's office said			1
@entity12 pleaded guilty earlier this fall to conspiracy to possess an unregistered destructive device and attempted obstruction of justice			1
@entity12 , 31 , was sentenced on those charges wednesday afternoon in @entity18 , according to a news release from the @entity20 for the @entity21 of @entity6			1
he will be subject to three years of supervised release after getting out of prison and must pay a $ 2,000 fine			0
@entity12 was among the emergency workers who responded to an ammonium nitrate explosion that killed 15 people -- most of them firefighters and paramedics -- and devastated @entity5 , a town about 20 miles north of @entity18 and 75 miles south of @entity30			2
he was vocal afterward as well , speaking to reporters and at a memorial service at @entity33 for the blast 's victims			0
in a previous statement , @entity12 's lawyers stressed that neither the charges nor the resulting plea agreement " have anything to do with the tragic explosion " that damaged dozens of homes , two schools and a nursing home and was so big that seismographs registered it as a small earthquake			1
@entity48 sees no link so far between weapons possession and @entity6 blast yet the blast did play a part in his arrest , according to the federal prosecutor			1
@entity12 's home was among those affected by the april 17 explosion , prompting him to stay in a hotel in @entity5			0
before that , authorities say , he 'd bought pipe bomb components and had them shipped to his house			0
there , with the help of another person , he built a place for the pipe bomb , storing it " inside two ammunition cans			0
" on april 26 , believing authorities going through explosion - damaged @entity5 homes might find the pipe bomb , @entity12 asked two people to go to his house , " retrieve the ammunition cans and bring them to him , which they did , " reports the @entity77 attorney 's office			1
the paramedic then packed the cans and bomb - making materials in a box to give to another man , telling him to " get rid of this			0
" this man took the box and put it in a spare bedroom in his @entity92 , @entity6 , home , finally opening it on may 7 , the prosecutor 's office said			1
" he immediately notified the @entity94 , who took possession of the items , " the @entity77 attorney 's office added			2
it was then that @entity12 became a focus of investigators , who saw the materials , including galvanized metal pipe , a fuse , coils of metal ribbon and several bags of chemical powders			0
@entity12 chose to plead guilty , his lawyers said in october , " to accept full responsibility for what he believes is his role in the allegations against him " and to avoid a long trial			2
" finally , ... mr. @entity12 believes that continuing to draw out this process will be a distraction to the most important issue , the losses suffered by the heroes , friends and loved ones in the @entity5 community , " the attorneys added .			0
