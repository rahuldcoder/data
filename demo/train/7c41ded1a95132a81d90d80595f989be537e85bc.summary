-- @entity1 hope to welcome back @entity3 midfielder @entity2 to their depleted team for tuesday 's second leg of the @entity7 quarterfinal against @entity8			1
the influential @entity2 missed last week 's 2 - 2 draw in @entity10 with a hamstring injury , but has been named in the titleholders ' 19 - man squad after receiving medical clearance			1
" he has got better over the last few days			0
it will depend a lot on how he feels after training this evening and tomorrow morning " coach @entity18 told @entity1 's web site on monday			2
however , @entity21 striker @entity20 -- who scored both goals in @entity23 -- misses out after suffering a calf injury in the warm - up before saturday 's 4 - 1 win over @entity27			1
teenager @entity28 , who scored two goals after stepping up in that match , will compete for a starting place alongside @entity32 with former @entity8 forward @entity33			0
blog : is @entity32 better than @entity35 ? @entity1 coach @entity18 is missing suspended captain @entity37 and fellow defender @entity38 , while @entity39 is cup - tied , so @entity42 international @entity40 and @entity44 's @entity43 should feature in the back four			2
right - back @entity45 returns from his domestic ban and midfielder @entity48 could play despite suffering an injury against @entity27 , while reserve players @entity50 and @entity52 were included in the squad , @entity1 's web site reported on monday			1
@entity1 blew a two - goal lead in the first leg despite dominating the first hour , and @entity18 said his team had to focus on the game and not be distracted by saturday 's showdown with @entity61 title rivals @entity60			2
" making it through this round or not will decide everything , " he said			0
" so we have to stay alive in the @entity7 in order to be optimistic about the eight league matches we have left			0
" whoever maintains possession of the ball and makes the other team run will take this match			0
we played very well over there and displayed good football , but they can play too and that 's why they came back for a draw			0
" blog : @entity80 will win @entity7 @entity8 have suffered another injury blow with midfielder @entity82 ruled out with a knee problem , joining captain @entity84 , @entity86 defender @entity85 and @entity87 forward @entity88 on the sidelines			1
@entity91 international song was substituted during saturday 's @entity93 win over @entity94 due to a groin worry , but a scan on his knee has revealed cartilage damage			2
@entity82 had filled in for @entity85 in central defense against @entity1 , but was caught out for both of @entity20 's goals			1
manager @entity102 said he was unsure whether veteran @entity104 would partner @entity103 in @entity82 's place , as the former @entity23 international was struggling to recover from his weekend exertions			1
" that is a decision i have to make after speaking to him tomorrow , " he told @entity8 's web site on monday			2
" today he was still not completely available although he managed to get a warm - up			0
" to go into such a game you must be completely fit or not play at all			0
" whichever team progresses to the last four will face a semifinal against either @entity119 champions @entity117 or @entity87 's @entity120			1
@entity122 's @entity117 team hold a slender 1 - 0 lead going into the second leg on tuesday , which will be played on @entity120 's artificial pitch			1
@entity127 midfielder @entity126 may miss the match after injuring an ankle in training on monday , while goalkeeper @entity131 and center - back @entity132 also face late fitness tests after picking up knocks in saturday 's 3 - 0 win over @entity137			1
@entity120 , seeking to become the first @entity87 team to reach the semifinals of @entity141 's premier club competition since @entity142 rivals @entity143 in 1991 , will be without the services of suspended midfielders @entity146 and @entity147			1
" the most important thing is the result			0
if we qualify without playing spectacular football , i am sure everyone at the club will be happy , " coach @entity150 told reporters			0
" i do not think it will help us to play on the artificial field			0
judging from the @entity87 national team 's games on the pitch and the manner in which the @entity87 teams have played in @entity141 , i do not think there are big differences			0
