approximately 36,000 deaths are caused by suicide each year in the @entity2			1
what if a simple blood test could one day help prevent that from happening ? in a new small study , researchers were able to predict who had experienced suicidal thoughts or attempted suicide just by looking at their blood			1
the experimental test was over 80 % accurate			0
" with a test like ours , we may be able to stem suicide rates by identifying those people and intervening early enough to head off a catastrophe , " said the study 's lead author , @entity14 , an assistant professor at the @entity17 's @entity16			1
@entity14 and his colleagues ran tests on samples of blood , looking for an increase of certain chemicals on a gene called @entity30 that seems to help the brain regulate stress			1
the gene 's instructions are carried out in a region of the brain that controls negative thoughts and impulsive behaviors			1
scientists believe people with the abnormal version of the gene have more trouble shutting off the flood of hormones produced by their bodies in response to stress			1
" it 's good to be stressed if you 're crossing the street			0
you need to be ramped up			0
you need to be focused , " @entity14 said			0
" but when you 're safely across the other side , you do n't want to stay in that mode			0
" since the chemicals were also consistently higher in the brains of people who have killed themselves , the @entity16 researchers think the chemicals may be linked to suicide			1
and these chemicals could , theoretically , be identified using a simple blood test			2
" this kind of genetic screening is going to be one way forward to predict who is at high risk , " said dr. @entity62 , a psychiatrist and neurochemist at @entity63			2
he was not involved in the study			2
experts have to rely on simply asking people whether they 're feeling suicidal to assess suicide risk			1
" if someone is really committed to committing suicide , they may choose to lie , " @entity14 said			2
but a blood test to gauge a person 's suicide risk is at least five to 10 years away from being readily available , he said			2
@entity78 , the vice president of research for the @entity80 , is optimistic about the potential of identifying suicidal patients earlier			0
" just because you have a risk does n't mean you 're destined to kill yourself			0
it means the opposite , " she said			0
" if you know you have a risk , you can be having conversations with your doctor , your mental health professional , and your family and friends about how to prevent getting to the point of a suicide crisis			0

in small study , researchers accurately predict suicidal thoughts and suicide attempts
researchers looked for certain chemicals related to a gene called @entity30
an abnormal version of this gene may cause people to react *differently* to stress
