@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 wasted no time on tuesday trying to undercut republicans as they began their convention , attacking a key @entity7 message before party luminaries took the spotlight in @entity0			1
republicans aggressively pushed their convention theme , " we built it , " while @entity3 sought to turn it back on @entity13 , who was affirmed as the nominee by a roll call of delegates in the first significant moments of the event			2
republicans highlighted a remark by president @entity20 , who said in july that public investment in infrastructure helps businesses grow			2
" if you are successful , somebody along the line gave you some help			0
... if you 've got a business , you did n't build that , " @entity20 said at the time			2
@entity30 builds on @entity20 comment in @entity32 @entity7 have seized on the comment to suggest that @entity20 is out of touch with small business owners and does not understand how the private sector works			2
democrats , however , contend that their rivals are taking things out of context			0
" so as @entity7 continue to distort the president 's words and push their ' we built that ' theme in @entity0 , " @entity44 mayor @entity43 said from the " war room " @entity3 have set up in downtown @entity0 near the convention site			1
" it 's worth asking : what did [ @entity13 ] @entity13 build ? " @entity43 , chair of next week 's @entity3 convention in @entity51 , answered his own question - " a bank account in @entity58 , investments in @entity54 and the @entity55 , and an inexplicably large @entity56			1
that 's what he built			0
" democrats are trying to nail @entity13 with a one - two punch : casting him as wealthy and privileged and saying that his policies would hurt the middle class			1
" a stronger , growing middle class means a stronger , growing @entity67 economy , " @entity69 gov. @entity68 said , " and that 's really what this election is all about			1
" " on a national scale , @entity13 economics would spell disaster for @entity67 's middle class , would be wrong for @entity67 's middle class , would not grow our middle class			1
and , in fact , would harm our middle class , " @entity68 added			1
on @entity13 's tenure at the top of @entity84 private equity firm @entity83 , @entity68 said the @entity7 's goal when investing in troubled companies was not creating jobs			2
instead , @entity68 suggested that the firm under @entity13 destroyed businesses and jobs in order to generate profit for investors			0
" in this economy , there are shipbuilders and there are ship - wreckers , " @entity68 said			0
" there are those who manufacture automobiles and there are those who scrap automobiles			0
there are those who build up and create things and there are those who make a quick profit by dismantling things			0
" the @entity13 campaign quickly fired back			1
in an email , @entity13 spokesman @entity113 accused @entity3 of launching " false and baseless attacks " against the former @entity117 governor whose tenure at the firm prior to his public life made him wealthy			2
" the facts speak for themselves , " @entity113 said , " with 23 million @entity67 struggling for work , nearly one in six @entity67 living in poverty , and median incomes declining , the @entity20 campaign can not defend a record of broken promises and failed policies			1
@entity13 and @entity30 have a plan to strengthen the middle class by creating jobs and turning around our economy			1
" asked at the event about recent polling indicating the public views @entity13 stronger on handling the economy , @entity20 senior adviser @entity134 countered			1
@entity134 pointed to other recent polling data suggesting the public is more partial to @entity20 on the questions of who cares about people and who cares about the middle class			1
" i think those polls demonstrate overwhelmingly that the president is their pick , " @entity134 said			0
@entity2 poll : which candidate cares more about you ? @entity2 poll : which candidate is better on the issues ? the event was the latest salvo in an escalating pace of aggressive campaigning , rhetoric , and attacks on the part of both presidential campaigns			0
in a break from tradition , the president is out campaigning this week while @entity7 hold their nominating convention			0
speaking in @entity166 tuesday , @entity20 said he expects the event to be a " pretty entertaining show			0
" @entity20 renews push with young voters " i 'm sure they 'll , you know , have some wonderful things to say about me , " he joked			0
@entity2 @entity174 producer @entity173 contributed to this report .			0

@entity20 campaign and @entity178 are in @entity0 getting their message out
@entity44 mayor : " it 's worth asking : what did @entity13 build ? "
@entity69 governor : " @entity13 economics would spell disaster for @entity67 's middle class "
