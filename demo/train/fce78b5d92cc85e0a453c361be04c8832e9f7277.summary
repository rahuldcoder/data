-- unless @entity5 users fight back , the days of the social network 's experiment with democracy may soon come to an end			1
the company on wednesday proposed to take away its users ' right to vote on major issues concerning the governance of its 1 billion - member online network			2
the reaction online has been less than welcoming			0
" @entity5 now argues that it is too big for democracy , much like the @entity21 government might , " writes @entity15 on the site @entity16			1
" call this new regime @entity5 with @entity23			2
" since 2009 , in what @entity5 calls an experiment with digital voting rights , @entity5 has allowed users to vote on major changes to the way it manages user data and privacy , if the online community expressed enough interest			1
if 7,000 people commented on a particular proposal , that triggered a vote			1
and if 30 % of the site 's active users -- which would be 300 million people at this point -- voted against the change , @entity5 would abandon it			1
now the company says it wants to ditch that system , replacing it with new ways for users to submit questions to @entity5 's privacy team			1
the company lists two primary reasons for the shift away from digital democracy : @entity5 has become extremely large , with more than a billion users ; and it 's a publicly traded company now , which means it is " accountable to regulators around the world			1
" " democracy can be difficult , especially for a multibillion dollar public company , " writes @entity58 for the @entity59			0
some technology writers are calling for users to revolt			0
" because it has n't revoked that right yet , there is still time for you to mount a campaign to retain it , in theory , " writes @entity64 for @entity65			0
" but @entity5 knows it 's highly unlikely that you will			1
it turns out that , for all of the shrill cries that fly around the internet every time ( ceo @entity75 and company make a tweak , most people just do n't care enough to take action			0
at least , not on the types of changes that @entity5 allowed them to vote on			1
" @entity15 , the @entity16 writer , says this is a watershed moment for the @entity74			2
" by repealing @entity82 , @entity5 abandons a fundamental norm -- that its users are citizens in a community , and not simply datapoints on an advertising algorithm			1
the vote may be quixotic , but if @entity5 remains the indispensable social network , you 'll want to be able to tell your grandchildren you fought for @entity5 freedom			1
who knows how @entity5 will develop without your input			2
" in clinical language released the day before the @entity95 celebrates @entity96 , a time when people here are unlikely to take much notice , @entity5 says it wants to " end the voting component of the process			1
" " we deeply value the feedback we receive from you during our comment period , " the site says a press release			0
" in the past , your substantive feedback has led to changes to the proposals we made			0
however , we found that the voting mechanism , which is triggered by a specific number of comments , actually resulted in a system that incentivized the quantity of comments over their quality			0
therefore , we 're proposing to end the voting component of the process in favor of a system that leads to more meaningful feedback and engagement			0
" the company adds : " we will continue to post significant changes to our @entity125 and @entity126 ) and provide a seven - day period for review and comment			0
as always , we will carefully consider your feedback before adopting any changes			0
" as @entity131 notes , @entity5 is creating other ways for users to submit feedback to the site			1
" as a replacement for the vote , @entity5 is proposing to continue offering the seven - day comment period on proposed changes to its governing documents			2
it will also offer two new ways for users to voice their governance concerns , " @entity141 writes			0
" there 's ' ask the chief privacy officer , ' a new feature on the official @entity146 that will let users submit questions to @entity149 , @entity5 's chief privacy officer			1
additionally , @entity152 would hold regular live - streamed webcasts where users can ask questions			0
if the proposal is allowed , these new features will be substituted for the vote			2
" so there you have it			0
