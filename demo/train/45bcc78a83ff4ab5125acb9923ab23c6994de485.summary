-- liberals and conservatives do n't agree on much these days , but many agree on this : the @entity7 ' @entity6 rollout has been a debacle			1
that 's reason enough for president @entity11 to replace agency secretary @entity13 , and he should go with an unconventional choice : @entity16 mayor @entity15			1
in leading the department as it prepared to launch the national insurance exchange platform , @entity13 has presided over less a rollout and more a rolling calamity			0
the ongoing fiasco has not only dealt a body blow to the @entity24 , it has set back the entire progressive project of good , smart government by failing so ridiculously on one of its most visible public initiatives			2
on the left , the two most prominent reasons given for not firing @entity13 have little to do with just deserts			0
many argue that it would be nearly impossible to get a suitable replacement confirmed by the @entity36			0
others contend that the situation is so critical that a leadership change would be a detrimental distraction : why burn precious time tying a nominee up in @entity36 hearings when the clock is ticking fast on a much - needed fix ? the " keep @entity13 " crowd is n't being irrational , but they are being uncreative			0
yes , it would be complicated to bring in a new @entity7 secretary at a precarious time for the rollout -- but presidents change generals in the middle of wars , and we change presidents every four or eight years , no matter what kind of craziness is going on ( fall 2008 , as everyone remembers , was not a calm time in @entity62 life )			1
and yes , the obvious roster of @entity11 allies would face trouble in the @entity36 , where the @entity67 ' lack of a filibuster - proof majority will sorely tempt @entity69 , as @entity70 put it last week , " to use this as kind of a way to leverage more concessions from the administration			2
" ( indeed , much of the coverage across the media has focused on how safe @entity13 ' job is			0
) but what if @entity11 made @entity69 an offer they did n't see coming -- and could n't refuse ? enter @entity15 , who is not a health care guru per se but certainly has some experience in overseeing @entity16 's $ 6.3 billion health care system ( not to mention his strong feelings against large , sugary sodas )			1
moreover , what he lacks in specific health care expertise , he more than makes up for in managerial prowess and technological acumen , as well as -- relevant to the confirmation fight question -- political independence			0
@entity15 did n't , after all , inherit his billions ; he founded @entity95 in 1981 , and it 's now a company with $ 8 billion in revenue ( he 's still the majority shareholder )			1
most of that revenue comes from selling @entity103 terminals , which are sophisticated computer platforms that integrate data from a dizzying array of sources			2
that would n't be such a bad skill set to have at @entity7 right now			2
just as important , @entity103 is still at the top of his game , and he 's going to need a job in two months			1
when asked by a @entity16 reporter late this summer what he 'd do after his final term expires , he proposed two weeks of skiing and golf			1
" after that , i 'd go ballistic			0
" so he 'll be looking for a new place to hang his hat come january 15			0
although there are n't a lot of positions that compare to being @entity62 's mayor , cabinet secretary just might			0
though he 's a @entity69 - turned - independent , @entity103 is much more liberal than today 's @entity69 , and it 's inconceivable he 'd be popular with conservatives on @entity129 ( libertarian @entity131 sen. @entity130 has called him " @entity103 " )			1
that said , @entity67 would n't need that many votes to break a @entity69 filibuster : an independent fiscal conservative like @entity103 would have a strong shot at peeling off bipartisanship - tolerant senators like @entity139 's @entity138 , @entity141 ' @entity140 , @entity143 's @entity142 , @entity145 's @entity144 , @entity147 's @entity146 and @entity149 's @entity148 and @entity150			2
add five of those folks to the 55 votes in the @entity67 caucus , and @entity103 is confirmable			0
even if the president decides to keep @entity13 in place , he should still call on @entity103 's managerial and it prowess and enlist him as the new " @entity24 czar			1
" @entity159 , former acting director of the @entity160 , is currently filling this role , but he lacks @entity103 's unique stature and experience -- and is slated to join the @entity165 staff as director of the @entity167 on january 1 ( the same day @entity16 will welcome its new mayor )			1
" @entity24 czar " would lack the prestige of a @entity171 appointment , but it 's still about the kind of thorny public problem that the newly unemployed mayor might be willing to tackle			2
not all democrats will love the @entity103 option -- @entity179 's huge momentum in @entity16 is in part a liberal referendum on the current mayor 's three terms -- but the man has more to recommend him than lovability : he 's a credible , creative and confirmable nominee who would offer the president ( whose approval ratings have just dipped to 39 % in the latest @entity189 tracking poll ) one of the few chances he 'll get to turn the page on the current @entity6 mess			1
that would do a lot to safeguard health reform for the long haul -- and begin to restore some much - needed faith in good government			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity201 .			0

@entity201 : @entity7 secretary should be replaced
he says @entity16 @entity15 has the ability to fix what 's *wrong* with @entity24
@entity103 's term is ending , and he 's looking for a big new job , @entity201 says
@entity201 : *picking* @entity103 would allow @entity11 a fresh start on his *signature* program
