-- @entity1 left @entity2 yesterday			1
after more than a decade at the firm , the executive left in a bit of a huff			1
the culture of @entity2 , @entity1 complained in a @entity9 op - ed , is " toxic and destructive			1
" it was not always so , he says			0
indeed , @entity1 insists , a decent " culture was [ @entity2 's ] secret sauce			1
" but then @entity16 and @entity17 " lost hold of the firm 's culture , " with the result that this " decline in the firm 's moral fiber represents the single most serious threat to [ the firm 's ] long - run survival			1
" moral fiber is no doubt important			0
so , too , is culture			2
but it is a mistake to understand culture without also understanding incentives			1
the culture that @entity1 praises was the product of a firm with a particular legal form , in a particular financial environment			1
at just about the same time , both particularities changed			2
and given these changes , it is no wonder that the culture @entity40 celebrates soon disappeared			2
for most of its history , @entity2 was a partnership			1
that meant the principals were jointly and individually liable for the losses of the firm			2
and for most of its history , @entity2 operated in a relatively boring financial environment			1
low risk and low reward			0
no doubt there was money to be made			2
but regulations designed to keep the system safe meant that the real money in that economy got earned by people who made real stuff			1
in the 1990s , however , both conditions changed			2
@entity2 went public in 1999 , though the partners kept 48 % of the stock themselves			1
and the regulations that had kept finance boring had all but disappeared by the time @entity2 's ipo was issued			1
these changes increased the market opportunity â € ” radically			0
they also increased the market pressure on financial firms â € ” radically , as well			2
bold ( and sometimes reckless ) experiments ( " financial innovations " ) created incredible opportunities for firms like @entity2 to profit			1
persistent and relentless pressure from a publicly traded stock pushed employees to experiment more boldly still			1
ticking across every employee 's computer was the firm 's stock price , a constant market signal of how they were doing â € ” up , good ; down , bad			1
those signals in turn were driven by the behavior of competing firms			0
another view : attack on @entity2 misfires recklessness by a competitor may produce higher profit in the short term			1
but the ( nontransparent derivatives ) market could n't easily distinguish between profit driven by recklessness and profit driven by better management			2
the consequence was a kind of teaching - to - the - test			0
behavior ( however reckless ) that produced the right signals from the market got rewarded			0
when that was n't enough , more and more , as @entity1 puts it , " people push the envelope			0
" but you ca n't negate the effect of these two changes with a simple injunction to " be good ! " being good would be great			1
but we wo n't get great ( or even mere good ) until we change the incentives that drove @entity115 off the cliff			1
we must , in other words , re-examine the changes that brought about this bad climate			0
@entity121 , for example , has long argued that " professional companies should not be permitted to become publicly held corporations			0
" as he puts it , " such a step puts them into high - stakes competition for investors , pushing them to maximize profits over their responsibilities to the public			0
" ( not to mention their client			0
) take away the stock ticker , in other words , and you make it easier for the traders to do ( long - term ) right			0
if we 're going to keep these instruments as part of our financial system , then we obviously need to increase the regulatory oversight that would keep at least a rational firm in check			0
not just the rules to regulate risk , but the punishments for behaving badly			0
if rewards are greater , then penalties need to be greater , too			0
at least if we 're to avoid the kind of culture that @entity1 so powerfully criticizes			0
none of this means that strong moral fiber and the right culture are n't important			1
since at least @entity161 we have known that markets with good morals are more efficient than markets without			0
but we can not rely upon the gossamer threads of being good when having more money than @entity167 is the reward for being bad			0
good law is needed , if good culture is to have a chance of return			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity175 .			2

@entity2 executive quits , *blaming* the firm 's culture
@entity175 : @entity2 changed when it went public and finance regulations were eased
the pressure to raise the stock price was constant signal for employees to take risks
@entity175 : culture ca n't *triumph* over incentives when so much money is at stake
