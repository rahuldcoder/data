@entity2 , 74 , was not known nationally until recently			2
his protest seems to have struck a chord with @entity3 society across the spectrum because corruption is pervasive at all levels of government , observers say			2
he has been able to mobilize public support because there is so much dissatisfaction with the issue			0
citizens have even created a website -- ipaidabribe.com -- where people can denounce the corruption they encounter in their daily lives			0
the prime minister 's handling of the protest appears to have added to @entity2 's status , because it makes it look like the government is going after the messenger rather than offering solutions			1

according to a 2010 @entity69 report , @entity3 ranked 87th out of 178 countries in its corruption - perception index			0

meanwhile , @entity3 's former telecom minister @entity78 , several bureaucrats and corporate officials are facing trial in connection with a multi-billion - dollar scandal involving the suspected below - price sale of mobile - phone radio waves or spectrum in 2008			2
the draw that @entity2 's planned hunger strike has was so great that police first tried to put conditions on it			1
organizers did not accept six of 22 police conditions for allowing the protest , including limiting the crowd to the capacity of the ground , police said			1
as a result , @entity2 was detained , as were 1,300 supporters who planned to join @entity2 at a protest site			1
a magistrate sent @entity2 and seven supporters to jail after they failed to post bail , according to @entity106 , a police spokesman in @entity0			1
they were freed hours later and shifted to a prison office after the magistrate issued release orders , jail spokesman @entity108 said			0

thousands gathered in several cities , chanting @entity120 slogans and echoing his demands			0
supporters carrying @entity3 flags held sit - ins , marches and noisy demonstrations			0
many had " i am @entity2 " labels on their shirts			2
@entity2 conducted a similar five - day hunger strike in april at @entity0 's @entity132 landmark , ending it after @entity3 's prime minister agreed to introduce long - pending legislation meant to crack down on graft			1
anti-corruption campaigners have rejected legislation prepared by the federal government to create a citizen ombudsman , saying the bill , now in @entity141 , is too weak to tackle endemic graft in the system			2
critics have accused the activists of undermining lawmakers who will decide the proposed law			0
prime minister @entity148 on wednesday justified the arrests in a statement before @entity141			1
" our government acknowledges the right of citizens to hold peaceful protests , " he said			0
@entity2 and his supporters would have been allowed to hold their protest fast if they had accepted the conditions , he said			1
amid shouts by opposition lawmakers over the police response to @entity2 's protest , the @entity3 prime minister also cited supremacy of the legislature			1
" i am not aware of any constitutional philosophy or principle that allows anyone to question the sole prerogative of parliament to make a law , " he said			0
@entity148 , whose government is roiled in massive corruption scandals , acknowledged in a national address earlier in the week that no single measure could handle chronic corruption			0
" i believe that there is no single big step which we can take to eradicate corruption			0
in fact , we will have to act simultaneously on many fronts , " @entity148 said			0
campaigners ' insistence on not accepting legislation other than their own version of the anti-corruption bill was " beyond comprehension , " home minister @entity183 told reporters tuesday			2
" how can you indirectly endorse such an argument that it is his bill and no other bill ( that is acceptable ) ? " he said			0
police took @entity2 into custody after the veteran activist told officers that he would " defy " orders not to hold a demonstration , @entity183 said			1
he said @entity2 and his supporters were welcome to raise their concerns with a parliamentary committee that will scrutinize the legislation before it is presented to lawmakers for a vote			2
activists appealed to government employees to take a day off work in a show of solidarity with @entity2 , a call federal officials were quick to term " wrong			2
