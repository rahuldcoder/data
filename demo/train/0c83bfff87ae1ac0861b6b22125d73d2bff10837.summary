@entity0 , @entity1 -- pope @entity4 was a step closer to sainthood saturday after pope @entity7 signed a decree recognizing the late pontiff 's " heroic virtues " and declaring him " venerable , " the @entity3 said			1
a miracle attributed to pope @entity4 's intervention will have to be verified for him to be declared " blessed , " or beatified			1
a second miracle would have to be confirmed for him to then be officially canonized , or made a saint			1
it 's too early to say how long that process may take , said @entity3 spokesman father @entity18			1
" it is recognized that he led a @entity21 life in a heroic and extraordinary manner , " @entity18 told @entity2			0
" this is a fundamental step in the road toward sainthood			0
now comes the examination of a miracle , which is the proof of the divine interceding power of @entity4 on behalf of @entity29			2
" @entity4 died on april 2 , 2005 , at the age of 84			2
several months after his death , his successor said he had dispensed with rules that normally impose a five - year waiting period before beatification			0
the rule is intended to allow time for evidence and witnesses supporting the sainthood cause to be prepared , as well as to wait for emotions to dissipate after death			2
but @entity4 himself set a precedent in 1999 when he granted a dispensation and let @entity47 's sainthood cause begin only two years after her death			1
" it 's a joy , i think , for the @entity50 because @entity4 is very admired and loved by so many people , not only in the church but also in the world , " @entity18 told @entity2			1
" it is good news for us all			0
" pope @entity7 signed another decree saturday declaring pope @entity59 , who died in 1958 , venerable , the @entity3 said			1
" the cause for sainthood for @entity59 was introduced a long time ago , " @entity18 said			0
" today 's decree is not a historical judgment on @entity59 or on his papacy			2
it is a judgment that the church gives on @entity59 's personal sanctity , on his @entity21 life achievements			0
the congregation and the pope have no doubts that @entity59 led a @entity21 life in an extraordinary and heroic way			0
" @entity2 's @entity74 contributed to this report .			0
