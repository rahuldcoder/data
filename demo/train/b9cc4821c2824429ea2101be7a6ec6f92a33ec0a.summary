-- jury selection begins monday in the federal hate crime case against two @entity4 men who are accused of fatally beating a @entity6 immigrant while shouting racial epithets at him			1
an all - white jury last year convicted @entity9 and @entity10 of misdemeanor simple assault , but acquitted them of felony counts including aggravated assault , ethnic intimidation and hindering apprehension			1
the 2008 beating of @entity17 and its aftermath divided the small , rural mining town of @entity20 , @entity4 , along racial lines and drew national attention			1
after the verdict , @entity4 gov. @entity23 sent a letter to @entity27 attorney general @entity26 recommending the @entity28 pursue civil rights charges			2
" the evidence suggests that mr. @entity17 was targeted , beaten and killed because he was @entity6 , " @entity23 wrote			1
" such lawlessness and violence hurts not only the victim of the attack , but also our towns and communities that are torn apart by such bigotry and intolerance			0
" jurors found @entity9 not guilty of third - degree murder			0
prosecutors alleged he delivered a fatal kick to @entity17 's head after @entity17 was knocked to the ground in the alcohol - fueled brawl on a residential @entity20 street			0
after last year 's trial , the two were sentenced to up to 23 months in the county jail			0
if convicted on the hate crime charges , @entity10 and @entity9 face a maximum penalty of life in prison			1
@entity10 also faces a maximum of 20 years in prison if convicted of obstruction , and an additional five years for conspiring to obstruct justice			1
" violence motivated by bigotry and hate has no place in @entity27 , and yet it remains all too prevalent in many of our communities , " said assistant attorney general @entity60 in the @entity28 statement announcing their indictment last year			0
once jury selection is finished in the federal case , the trial in the @entity71 in @entity72 , @entity4 , is expected to take five days , according to information posted on the court 's website			2
for months , attorneys have been haggling over the details of the federal trial			2
in a motion filed in august , lawyers representing @entity9 and @entity10 criticized a proposed jury question list federal prosecutors had submitted , claiming the question list included plans to question jurors about their registration to vote , their political philosophy , their attitude toward enforcing the law , the books they read and what bumper stickers they have on their car			0
" the government has attempted to politicize this case from the beginning and its proposed questionnaire is but a further attempt to do so , " the motion said			1
they continued , " the premise for the government 's questions on political philosophy is obvious			2
the government deems white , rural conservatives as likely bigots unable to apply the law and follow the court 's instructions in this case			1
not only is this premise insulting , it fails to further the court 's obligation to ensure a fair and impartial jury			0
" the final question list approved by @entity27 district judge @entity116 has been sealed			0
last year , @entity4 prosecutors alleged a group of teens including @entity10 and @entity9 baited @entity17 , an undocumented @entity6 immigrant , into a confrontation following a night of drinking			1
@entity10 was convicted of corrupting minors for providing the alcohol to his friends before the fight			2
according to the federal indictment , @entity10 and @entity9 were walking home from a local festival when they encountered @entity17 , and attacked him on a street " by striking and kicking him while members of the group yelled racial slurs at him , " the @entity28 said			0
a medical examiner ruled @entity17 died from blunt - force trauma to the head , according to the indictment .			0
