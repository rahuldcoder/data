@entity0 -- the @entity3 on monday postponed the launch of a new manned mission to the @entity6 due to last week 's accident in which an unmanned cargo craft was lost , the state news agency @entity2 reported			1
@entity9 of the space agency , @entity3 , said the next manned mission , originally planned to launch on september 22 , now would occur in late october or early november , according to the @entity2 report			1
in the @entity14 , @entity13 's space station program manager told reporters monday that the timing of the rescheduled mission could force the temporary de-manning of the space station later this year			1
however , the @entity13 official , @entity20 , said no decisions can be made until a commission appointed by @entity23 completes its investigation of the august 24 crash involving a @entity27 rocket -- the same kind used to power the flights of crew members to the space station			1
with a planned rotation of the six crew members aboard the space station scheduled to begin next month , a delay in using the @entity27 could prevent the ability to bring replacements , @entity20 said			1
" if we do n't have @entity27 flying by the middle of november -- the 16th or so , the normal landing time for the last crew -- we would have to de-man @entity6 at that point , " @entity20 said			0
the six astronauts at the space station are three from @entity23 , two from the @entity14 and one from @entity46			1
due to the schedule change announced monday , the three @entity23 astronauts on board will return to @entity50 eight days later than originally planned , on september 16 instead of september 8 , @entity9 said			1
they will fly a @entity27 vehicle already at the space station			2
@entity20 said another @entity27 vehicle at the space station , which is set to fly back the other three crew members , will have its certification for the return mission expire by mid-november			1
if there ca n't be a new manned mission from @entity50 by then , administrators will have to decide whether to take extensive steps to extend the vehicle 's certification for the return flight , proceed on a return flight without certification , or de-man the space station by flying back the remaining crew members within the certification period , he said			1
" we 're going to do what 's safest for the crew and for the space station , " @entity20 said			2
he acknowledged that leaving the space station without any crew members increased the risk for trouble			2
" there is a greater risk of losing the iss when it 's unmanned than if it were manned , " @entity20 said , adding that the risk increase " is not insignificant			0
" the commission in @entity23 investigating last week 's accident will determine the new launch date for the next manned mission , @entity9 said , according to the @entity2 report			1
prior to that mission , @entity3 will make two unmanned @entity27 launches , " either an automated one or a freighter or both , " he said			0
on august 24 , a @entity92 space freighter carrying food and other items to the space station broke up over southern @entity96 after failing to separate from its @entity98 carrier rocket , @entity2 reported			0
it was the first loss of a @entity100 in more than 30 years of operation , according to the report , which said the cause was believed to be a rocket engine failure			0
however , it was the second failed space launch in @entity23 in less than 10 days			0
on august 18 , @entity23 lost a sophisticated @entity108 - @entity107 telecommunications satellite when the launch vehicle put it into the wrong orbit			0
the @entity92 that went down last week was to deliver more than 3.8 tons of cargo to the space station crew , including food supplies , medical equipment , personal hygiene items and scientific equipment needed for experiments , according to @entity3 and space officials			2
@entity20 said monday that space station crew is well - supplied due to the delivery of goods by the final @entity14 shuttle mission carried out by @entity123 last month			2
@entity13 is now reliant on the @entity3 to ferry @entity14 astronauts to orbit , since the grounding of the @entity14 shuttle fleet has left the @entity14 with no way to lift humans into space			0
plans are in the works for private companies to begin shipping cargo to the station , and eventually to carry astronauts as well			0
@entity1 's @entity137 contributed to this report .			0

new : a @entity13 official says the space station may have to be de-manned
the mission originally planned for september 22 will occur weeks later
the *announcement* follows last week 's loss of a @entity23 supply vessel
