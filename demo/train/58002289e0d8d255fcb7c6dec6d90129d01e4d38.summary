-- @entity1 , a member of a political party that waged guerrilla war against the government 17 years ago , claimed the presidency of @entity6 on sunday night			1
@entity7 's @entity1 shows his ballot before voting sunday in @entity9 , @entity6			1
" this is the happiest night of my life , " @entity1 told a jubilant crowd at his election headquarters			1
" it 's also the night of greatest hope for @entity6			1
" with 90.68 percent of the votes counted , the @entity7 party 's @entity1 had 51.27 percent , while the @entity22 party 's @entity20 had 48.73 percent , the country 's @entity16 said			1
the final tally will be certified within 48 hours , the electoral council 's @entity23 said in a nationally televised news conference			2
@entity28 ' victory ended a 20 - year hold on the presidency by the right - leaning @entity22			1
" now the @entity22 party passes into opposition , " @entity1 said			1
" arena ... can be assured that it will be listened to and respected			2
" although polls had indicated the race had tightened considerably in the past few weeks , most analysts had predicted that @entity1 would win			1
" it 's a sign that there 's democracy in that country , which is something the @entity45 tried to foster , " said @entity36 , who as president @entity38 's assistant secretary of state for inter-american affairs from 1989 - 93 was heavily involved in ending @entity6 's 12 - year civil war			1
the @entity7 , which is the @entity47 acronym for the @entity7 , was formed in late 1980 as an umbrella group for five leftist guerilla organizations fighting a @entity45 - backed military dictatorship			1
the guerrillas and the government signed a peace pact in 1992 and the @entity7 became a legitimate political party			1
by some estimates , 75,000 @entity6 died during the war			1
the new president will find " a country that still retains a lot of bitterness , a lot of division , " said @entity61 , president of the @entity64 - based @entity63 policy institute			2
" this country is completely divided , " @entity68 official @entity67 said on @entity0 affiliate @entity70 tv station sunday night			0
the election , @entity61 said , was " an important test of how far @entity6 has come			1
" the result also will be an important test of how far @entity6 will go			1
with an economy in deep trouble and neither party having enough seats to control the national @entity79 , much will depend on the party that lost			0
" conflict occurs when one person wants to force a conflict , " @entity61 said			0
" @entity84 requires both sides			0
" no one is certain how @entity22 will handle the loss			0
" that 's a big unknown , " said @entity88 , a @entity89 analyst with the consulting firm @entity90			2
" i still think they 'll play ball			0
they have an incentive to get along with the new administration			0
they certainly do n't want to be shut out of the process			0
" @entity99 , who served in high - level @entity89 posts for presidents @entity101 , @entity38 and @entity102 , sees the possibility of a spirited fight from @entity22			2
" if i had to guess , i 'd say arena will try to put democratic obstacles in the way of an @entity7 consolidation of power , " @entity99 said			1
although @entity22 , which are the @entity47 initials for the @entity22 , has come back from a 14 - point deficit in some polls two months ago , @entity99 said winning a fifth consecutive term was " swimming against the tide			2
" " people in @entity6 are weighing risks and opportunities , " @entity99 said			1
" they have an opportunity to replace a party with which they have gotten tired			0
" @entity61 also saw voter fatigue with @entity22 , saying , " one party has managed the country forever and ever			0
" many of the 2.4 million @entity6 who voted weighed competing doubts			1
" the uncertainty is that the @entity7 has never been in power , " @entity88 said			1
but voters also asked themselves , she said , whether they were " better off than they were five years ago , 10 years ago			0
" @entity20 , she said , could not run on a message of change			0
@entity132 ' message of change and putting new people in power was more effective			0
since the war ended , @entity6 have mostly supported @entity22 because of concerns over the @entity7 's left - wing agenda and the group 's guerrilla background			1
there also have been outside influences			0
" the country has been afraid to vote for the left because of fears from @entity64 , " @entity143 , director of the nonprofit @entity144 , said recently			2
with the election of @entity149 as president of the @entity45 , @entity6 may expect a different attitude from @entity64			1
@entity6 , @entity152 and @entity153 have been the @entity45 ' closest allies in @entity89			1
@entity143 calls the three nations " @entity64 's street - corner guys			1
" with an @entity7 victory , @entity6 joins other @entity89 countries that have elected leftist leaders in recent years -- @entity160 , @entity161 , @entity162 , @entity163 , @entity164 , @entity165 , @entity166 and @entity167			1
but @entity88 and others warn that the @entity45 must not lump everyone together			0
" people tend to look at the left in @entity89 and oversimplify it , " @entity88 said			0
" there 's the good left and the bad left			2
" or as @entity36 put it , " there 's leftists , and there 's leftists			0
" @entity36 sees two types of leftist governments in @entity89 : " institutional " governments like @entity167 's that " have made peace with the free market " while still championing social programs , and populist , more - radical governments like @entity160 's			1
analysts are not sure what to make of @entity1 , a former freelance journalist for @entity0 who is projecting a moderate image			2
" the @entity7 did something very clever , " @entity99 said			2
" they put somebody at the head of the party who is not a guerrilla , not a terrorist			0
" even the @entity7 may not know what to expect from @entity28			1
@entity88 calls it " an issue of uncertainty " between the former journalist and the former guerrilla group			0
" there 's a lot of unknowns about how the relationship between @entity1 and the @entity7 will proceed , " she said , adding that she will watch his cabinet picks and whether he brings in people from other parties			1
@entity132 ' victory was a defining moment for the @entity7			1
" it 's an important transformation , " @entity61 said			0
" the ex-guerrillas have to make a decision : are they going to try to bring about revolutionary , radical change or manage the whole country and have step - by - step reform ? " @entity36 sees it as " a test of whether they will be pragmatic or ideological			0
" the @entity7 may not have a choice but to be pragmatic			2
the party holds 35 seats in the 84 - member @entity226			2
forty - three votes are needed to pass most legislation and some measures require " supermajority " approval of 56 votes			0
that means that , if @entity22 and the @entity7 can not agree on a measure , they have to look to one of the minor parties for support			2
the @entity241 , which is the @entity241 , has 11 seats and could emerge as a power broker			0
two others parties hold six seats			0
" it is in the @entity241 's interest to play ball as well , " @entity88 said			0
" the @entity241 will act as a moderating force			0
" @entity88 also said the @entity7 will likely take a moderate approach because the nation relies too much on outside investments and remittances from @entity6 living abroad for the former guerrillas to adopt too much of a radical approach			1
but @entity61 worries about something else			0
" i think @entity22 may be prepared for this [ loss ] , " he said			0
" i 'm concerned that the @entity7 may not be prepared to govern			2

new : @entity7 's @entity1 had 51.27 percent of the vote , with 84 percent of ballots counted
a @entity28 victory would end 20 - year hold by the right - leaning arena
by some estimates , 75,000 @entity6 died during the civil war
