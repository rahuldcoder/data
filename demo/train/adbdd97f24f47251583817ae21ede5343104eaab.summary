the news from @entity1 is generally bad news			1
in the past week , which was far from atypical , suicide bombers attacked a court building in the northwestern city of @entity7 taking hostages and killing four people			0
in the southern city of @entity15 the director of a renowned social program working in the megacity 's poorest neighborhoods was shot and killed			0
and gunmen kidnapped two female @entity18 tourists in southwestern @entity1			2
but this past week also saw more than a glimmer of good news from @entity1 : saturday , march 16 marked an extraordinary moment in @entity1 history , as this is the first time a civilian government has served its entire five - year term ( from 2008 to 2013 )			1
and , for the first time in its history , the @entity1 military appears unwilling to mount a coup against the civilian government			1
the military has successfully executed three coups and attempted a number of others since @entity1 's independence in 1947			1
today the army understands that the most recent coup by @entity37 who took power in 1999 has tarnished its brand			0
@entity37 hung on to power for almost a decade and his imposition of emergency rule in 2007 triggered massive street protests and eventually his ouster			0
on saturday , @entity37 announced he is returning to @entity1 from self - imposed exile on march 24 to run in elections that are to be held two months from now			1
in a telling sign that @entity1 is moving into something of a new era , @entity1 military officials are not supportive of @entity37 's return and nor is much of the @entity1 public			1
on may 11 , @entity1 will go to the polls to elect a new civilian government for a five - year term , and there is now a good prospect for continued , uninterrupted civilian government until at least 2018			1
in terms of @entity1 's long - term health and stability , the fact that the country is in an unprecedented era of lengthy civilian rule will help erode the @entity1 military 's present position as having uncontested supremacy in all matters that relate to the country 's national security , in particular its relations with @entity74 and with @entity75			1
the military has backed insurgent and terrorist groups in @entity74 and @entity75 to maintain its perceived interests in these countries			1
a more confident civilian @entity1 government will , hopefully , over time be less likely to support these militant groups			1
another great opportunity ( and potential peril ) will present itself in @entity75 , when @entity75 go to the polls in april 2014 for the third presidential election since the fall of the @entity88			2
if that election is perceived as being relatively free and fair this would go a long way to ease tensions in the @entity75 body politic , increase @entity75 's overall security and reassure both @entity75 and outside investors that the country has a promising future			2
on the other hand , if the 2014 election is seen as unfair , corrupted and is deeply contested , this would likely precipitate a vicious circle of conflict , deteriorating security and capital flight			0
the @entity105 , therefore , should do everything it can to provide technical and security assistance to make these elections go as well as possible			0
but unlike what happened in the run - up to the 2009 @entity75 presidential election , @entity105 officials should not get involved in privately backing certain candidates			2
this private support had the unintended effect of splitting the opposition to @entity75 president @entity117 , as key leaders of the @entity120 opposition all believed they were " @entity105 's candidate			2
" it also deeply alienated @entity117 , whose occasional diatribes against the @entity105 are best understood as due to his lingering resentment over this issue			0
a key aspect of @entity105 and @entity128 planning for the @entity75 presidential elections in april 2014 is that given the fact that there are no discernible front - runners to succeed @entity117 , there may be no clear winner who attains more than 50 % of the vote , which under @entity75 electoral laws would necessitate a runoff election between the two leading candidates			1
security , technical and economic assistance for the @entity75 elections should be prepared to extend into summer 2014 , because it is not clear as yet when that runoff might be held			1
last year the @entity105 and @entity75 negotiated a @entity146 , which ensures @entity105 will continue to play a supporting role there until 2024			2
the exact details of what that agreement means in practice are still being hammered out ( according to @entity105 officials , these negotiations may take until november ) but they are likely to include not only significant @entity105 aid but also many thousands of @entity105 soldiers stationed in @entity75 for years into the future as a guarantor of the country 's stability			2
the @entity105 military has given president @entity161 a range of options under which as few as 6,000 or as many as 20,000 soldiers would remain in @entity75 after 2014			1
those forces would work as advisers to the @entity75 army and mount special operations raids against the @entity88 and @entity169			2
whatever the final decision is on troop levels , the key point is that the @entity161 administration and other @entity105 officials should emphasize very clearly that the thousands of @entity105 soldiers who will remain in @entity75 are there to support the @entity105 ' long - term partnership agreement with @entity75 -- and that its life extends well beyond 2014			1
this is important to emphasize , because @entity75 have been understandably confused by some of the different signals the @entity161 administration has made about its commitment to @entity75 in the past			2
major confusion arose after president @entity161 's december 2009 announcement of the " surge " of 30,000 troops to @entity75 , which was coupled with the announcement that those troops would begin to withdraw beginning in july 2011			2
in many @entity75 ' minds , the withdrawal date became more important than the fact that during his first term @entity161 actually tripled the number of @entity105 soldiers in @entity75 from around 30,000 to a total of 90,000			1
when the @entity161 administration announces the number of soldiers who will remain in @entity75 post- 2014 , it should emphasize that the @entity105 commitment to @entity75 is set to last until at least 2024			2
this will help in multiple ways : first , this guarantee of a long - term @entity105 commitment to @entity75 will encourage other @entity128 countries to maintain some of their own troops in @entity75 to work with the @entity75 in areas like training the army and police past the end of the @entity128 combat mission in december 2014			1
such an announcement will also help reassure @entity75 that the @entity105 wo n't be simply turning off the lights in @entity75 in december 2014			2
and it will signal to regional powers like @entity1 and @entity218 that the @entity105 plans to remain engaged in @entity75 for many years into the future			1
a key issue facing the @entity75 government as the @entity105 draws down its forces is how will the @entity75 economy fare ? should the economy collapse , the @entity75 government 's ability to deal with security issues would be substantially eroded			1
already , rents in @entity229 are tumbling and nongovernmental organizations are laying off staff			0
surprisingly , however , a rigorous and comprehensive @entity233 study last year found that @entity75 will continue to have a healthy growth rate , dropping from its present robust 9 % a year rate " to closer to 5 % on average until 2018			2
" ( the @entity105 economy 's yearly growth rates over the past four years have been around 2 %			0
) the economic contraction as the @entity105 draws down is likely to be less severe than might be supposed , partly because the hundreds of billions that the @entity105 military has spent in @entity75 over the past decade is spending that almost entirely benefits the @entity105			1
the @entity233 study points out that " military spending by the @entity105 ( and other countries ) finances the salaries of military personnel , investments in weapons equipment and systems			0
... the impact of its withdrawal is therefore likely to be muted			0
" another encouraging sign is the investigation of the troubled @entity254 , in which some $ 900 million was lost to fraud , indicating that the culture of impunity for corrupt @entity75 officials might be beginning to erode			0
earlier this month , 21 officials were found guilty of fraud and two of the former heads of the bank were sentenced to five years in prison			0
the @entity75 attorney general 's office said last week that it would appeal the sentences as being too soft given the scale of the fraud			0
a key question is the extent to which the @entity75 army and police can operate effectively against the @entity88 as the @entity105 withdraws			0
as yet the @entity75 army has n't shown the ability to conduct large - scale operations without significant @entity105 support			0
in addition , a big issue for the army is the extraordinarily high attrition rate			0
today , a little more then a quarter of the recruits to the army drop out every year			0
because of this high dropout rate , @entity128 is now considering maintaining the @entity75 army and police at its present large size of 352,000 men through 2018			0
( estimates of the size of the @entity88 typically are in the 25,000 range			0
) one indicator of the increasingly @entity75 - led nature of the fight against the @entity88 is the fact that some 300 @entity75 soldiers and policemen are now dying every month in the war , while in january three @entity105 soldiers were killed , which was the lowest number of any month during the previous four years			0
on @entity75 , @entity1 has some important common goals with the @entity105 , @entity128 and @entity75 themselves			1
@entity1 does not want to see @entity75 collapse into a renewed civil war , which would destabilize @entity1 , nor does it want to see the @entity88 in charge of the country again			1
when the @entity88 was in power in @entity75 the group resisted @entity1 efforts at control , while the @entity1 @entity88 have killed many thousands inside @entity1			1
these basic shared goals , no civil war and no @entity88 control of @entity75 , can help to create the conditions for a successful post- 2014 @entity75 @entity1 also wants a @entity316 - led government in @entity229 and for the @entity88 to have some representation in the south and the east			1
these are also goals the @entity75 can live with			0
@entity117 is , after all , a pashtun and given the fact that @entity316 are the largest ethnic group , the next president of @entity75 almost certainly will be a @entity316			0
and other ethnic minorities can live with a situation in which the @entity88 assume a number of provincial and district governorships providing they lay down their arms , join the political process and recognize the @entity75 constitution			0
according to a senior @entity75 government official , numerous discussions between representatives of the @entity88 and the @entity75 government have taken place over the past years to discuss such a political accommodation , although , so far , not much of anything has come of these talks			1
note : this story is adapted from testimony by @entity341 delivered to the @entity342 on march 19 , 2013 .			0

@entity341 : for the first time , @entity1 government served its full term
he says lack of military coup attempt shows government is more stable than many think
elections in @entity1 , @entity75 likely to be crucial for those two nations
@entity357 : he says @entity75 economy is resilient and corruption may be receding
