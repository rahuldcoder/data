-- i met dr. @entity2 while making a documentary about my own complex journey through fatherhood			0
his vasectomy missions to @entity8 countries inspired me to launch both a movement and to become his 25,000th client			0
i have made many films around the world about angry and alienated men who , lacking positive ways to express their innate power and potential , inflict brutality on women and children			1
in contrast , observing men on the day they make a conscious choice to exit the gene pool reveals the sex 's vulnerability and thoughtfulness			1
to transform this positive choice into a global movement , @entity2 and i created the first @entity31 in 2013 -- and set out to inspire 100 doctors in 25 countries to do 1,000 vasectomies			1
from a medical perspective , a vasectomy is a simple procedure that takes about 15 minutes			0
the doctor severs the vas deferens and then seals up both ends , thus preventing sperm from reaching your semen			1
it has a less than 1 % failure rate , compared with 18 % for condoms , making it an important option for men whose families are complete			1
and yet , even though modern techniques require neither needle nor scalpel , and for the vast majority of men it takes only a few days to recover , it 's still a tough sell			1
yes , there are places , like @entity59 , where 20 % of men choose vasectomies , but there are countries where the rate is less than 1 %			1
but if ease and effectiveness do n't convince a man of the benefits of vasectomy , there are many compelling sociological and health reasons as well			0
for example , 51 % of pregnancies in the @entity73 are unintended , and these pregnancies come with adverse maternal and child health outcomes , such as delayed prenatal care and an increased risk of premature birth			0
poverty and family are also correlated , with double the incidence of poverty in nine - member households than in four - member households			2
and with all the controversy surrounding abortion , there 's no better way to avoid one than a vasectomy			0
sadly , while men waffle on the sidelines , more than 300 million women have had tubal ligations -- six times the number of men having vasectomies , even though tubal ligations are more invasive , costly and risky			1
while both procedures are almost equally effective , tubal failures can result in ectopic pregnancies , a leading cause of maternal mortality			2
with all these reasons , you 'd think for men who no longer wish to have children choosing a family planning option that is permanent , safe and secure would be a no - brainer			1
but if logic , guilt or fairness did the trick , we 'd be living on a planet much further away than @entity117			0
the @entity119 language uses the same word for " vasectomy " and " castration " and that sums up what so many men believe			2
and it 's not just men			2
many women would agree with a friend of mine , who once suggested vasectomies change a man 's status from alpha male to alpha - lite			1
fear and good information might get a man to wear a condom , but @entity31 needed compelling stories and there was no shortage of them			1
there were men who traveled hundreds of miles to have the procedure for their wives , and those who did it to help their children emerge from poverty			2
these men , who rise up and shoulder responsibility for family planning -- although still the minority -- serve as our inspiration			1
in my travels , i met men in their 20s who know they do n't want children and men in their 70s who do			2
there was an @entity169 veteran who asked , " why am i considered old enough to die or kill for my country , but not old enough to decide about children ? " these are tough questions			0
@entity2 suggested he preserve some sperm			0
on @entity31 , we do n't decide who should or should not get a vasectomy , but we do insist that it be voluntary			1
we acknowledge there is a small chance that a vasectomy can cause long lasting pain , and we certainly have great sympathy for these men			2
a recent study also suggests a possible link between prostate cancer and vasectomies			0
it 's important to note that there are many other studies that suggest otherwise			0
the bottom line is that all methods of birth control come with some element of risk			0
the unfair part is that it 's women who take it on almost exclusively for one third of their lives			0
for all our efforts to inspire men , it was n't until we empowered the urologists and vasectomists who perform these procedures that our movement took off			0
providing vasectomies is not easy or always accepted , but on friday , there will be approximately 300 skilled doctors from 30 countries participating in what will be the largest male - oriented family planning event in history			1
what we learned in creating @entity31 bodes well for our future			1
men reveal the best of who we are when we work together to serve a greater purpose , one that honors ourselves , our families and our future			0
