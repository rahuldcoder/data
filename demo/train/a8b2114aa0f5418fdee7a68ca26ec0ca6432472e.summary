@entity0 -- to @entity3 , president @entity2 is a gift that keeps on giving when it comes to campaign fodder to use against @entity7			1
a line from @entity2 's economic speech on thursday is giving republicans more material to continue slamming their opponents as @entity2 surrogates			1
that tactic has been key to @entity3 ' midterm strategy this cycle , at a time when a majority of @entity18 -- 52 % according to the latest @entity1 / @entity20 poll -- disapprove of the president 's job			1
" i am not on the ballot this fall , " @entity2 said at @entity23 on thursday			2
" but make no mistake : these policies are on the ballot			0
every single one of them			0
" rep. @entity29 , the @entity3 nominee for @entity30 in @entity31 , already played up the line during an interview friday			2
" well i think the president himself yesterday stated that his policies are going to be on the ballot , " he said			0
" those failed policies are what the people of @entity31 are facing and voting on			0
" and republicans in three key states for control of the @entity30 have already jumped on those words in videos that made it online less than 24 hours after @entity2 spoke			1
@entity47 when it comes to @entity7 candidates setting up a sharp divide with @entity2 , @entity47 candidate @entity48 has been one of the most visible , even pointing out in a recent ad , by saying " i 'm not @entity2			1
" but sen. @entity54 's ad released friday looks to paint a different picture : " @entity48 says this election is not about her support for @entity2 and his failed policies , " the ad 's narrator says , before playing the clip of @entity48 stating she 's not the president			2
" but @entity2 himself says a vote for @entity48 is a vote for his policies			2
" @entity66 sen. @entity68 ' campaign also pounced on @entity2 's comments -- even giving its take on the national backdrop to the president 's policies			1
" trillions in new debt			0
nearly 10 million @entity18 unemployed , " the @entity78 ' ad 's narrator says			0
the ad cuts to @entity2 's quote from thursday , and then ties him to independent candidate @entity81 , painting him as a @entity82			1
" a vote for @entity81 is a vote for the @entity2 agenda , " flashes across the screen before the ad fades out			2
@entity87 @entity3 @entity89 's campaign follows a similar formula in attacking sen. @entity91			1
" he 's not up for reelection , i know you 're shocked to hear that , " @entity89 quipped at a campaign event that opens his latest ad			0
" but his number one foot soldier @entity98 is			0
" the final words of the ad : " send a message to @entity2			0

in @entity47 , @entity66 and @entity87 , @entity3 @entity30 candidates are playing up the president 's quote .
