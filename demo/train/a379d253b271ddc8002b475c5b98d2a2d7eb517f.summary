-- since it was revealed this week that the @entity3 is collecting the telephone and @entity6 data of millions of people , this is the question most people have asked me more than any other : " why should i care that the government has all this information ? " on thursday , as we were learning that the @entity3 has been storing the so - called metadata of millions of @entity17 customers , a woman told me that she was less concerned about the intelligence agency knowing her phone number than she was the local @entity20 , which has been calling her at inconvenient times and pressuring her to renew prescriptions she was filling at another pharmacy			1
maybe it 's because we do n't feel the surveillance state bearing down on us the way we do pushy marketers that many people are n't that concerned about the government compiling enormous databases on our digital activities			1
indeed , we already knew that intelligence agencies have been doing this for years			2
in 2006 , shortly after the revelation that the @entity3 was monitoring some @entity37 ' phone conversations without warrants , a poll showed the public was evenly divided on whether it was a good or a bad practice			2
if it helped catch terrorists or prevent attacks , roughly half of the people responding were willing to give up some measure of privacy			1
inherent to that calculation is our understanding that the definition of " privacy " has changed			1
it does n't have remotely the same context as it did in the late 1970s when the law restricting the government 's authorities to monitor @entity37 -- authorities that had been scandalously abused -- was enacted			1
back then , our expectation of privacy extended to our relationships with our family and friends			1
to things like phone calls or the mail			2
today , these personal connections , and the information we willingly share about ourselves , are the foundations of our increasingly public social networks			0
we know that complete strangers are looking at our @entity73 pages			0
should we be surprised that the government is too ? probably not			1
but you might be surprised to find out that all this information the @entity3 and other agencies are collecting is not very useful for stopping terrorists , which is why it 's being collected in the first place			1
to date , there have been practically no examples of a terrorist plot being pre-emptively thwarted by data mining these huge electronic caches			1
( rep. @entity87 , chairman of the @entity88 , has said that the metadatabase has helped thwart a terrorist attack " in the last few years , " but the details have not been disclosed			1
) when i was writing my book , " @entity94 , " about the rise of these big surveillance systems , i met analyst after analyst who said that data mining tends to produce big , unwieldy masses of potential bad actors and threats , but rarely does it produce a solid lead on a terrorist plot			1
those leads tend to come from more pedestrian investigative techniques , such as interviews and interrogations of detainees , or follow - ups on lists of phone numbers or e-mail addresses found in terrorists ' laptops			0
that shoe - leather detective work is how the @entity37 has tracked down so many terrorists			0
in fact , it 's exactly how we found @entity122			0
now , electronic data does play a crucial role in those investigations			1
but only when it is narrowly searched , with specific criteria at hand -- a name , say , or a phone number			0
officials have said that this is how that metadatabase is used			0
analysts can only look at it when they have the number of a suspected bad actor , and they want to search for his connections			0
that may offer some reassurance , however slim , that there are at least some controls on how that information is being searched			0
but we 've also learned about a separate collection program , known as @entity147 , that reportedly lets analysts tap directly into the central servers of top @entity37 internet companies , and then siphon off e-mails , photographs and audio and video files			0
we 're told that @entity37 individuals ' information is routinely swept up in these searches , and that it 's subsequently segregated from information about foreigners			0
but according to training manuals for @entity147 examined by the @entity162 , analysts are told that when @entity37 get caught in the net , they should just file a quarterly report about the incident , and that " it 's nothing to worry about			0
" this looks a lot like that big data mining that analysts have told me does n't produce solid leads			2
what it does do is implicate potentially innocent @entity37 in a vast sweep of some of the most ostensibly private information there is , particularly your e-mails			0
reasonable people can come to different conclusions about how comfortable they are with the government building all these databases			2
but we should n't accept officials ' broad claims that these searches , and the information they 're based on , are protecting the nation 's security			2
if we 're going to hand over so much information about our once - private lives , we should have some assurance that the trade is worth it			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity197 .			1

should you care that the government is collecting telephone and @entity6 data ?
@entity197 says *attitudes* to privacy have changed
massive quantity of data is unlikely to yield evidence of terrorist plots , he says
@entity197 : we need hard evidence that trading off privacy for security actually works
