-- before the light , the dark			2
@entity4 's training facilities are spartan			1
the building in @entity6 , the capital of @entity7 , where the 23 - year - old judo fighter is preparing for the @entity9 is small and gloomy			1
electricity is intermittent ; the elements rarely kept at bay by the potholed roof			2
poverty and poor training facilities are nothing new for thousands of athletes from the developing world preparing for the chance to realize their dreams of competing in an @entity19			1
but @entity4 , like many others in the @entity22 world , has had to overcome much more than just challenging training conditions			1
last year he was shot in the abdomen whilst protesting against the rule of then president @entity26 , who stepped down after hundreds of protestors were killed by his security forces			1
the bullet shattered inside him			2
he feared first that his @entity19 dream , rather than his life , was over			2
but after specialist treatment , @entity4 has returned , and has thrived in preparation for the biggest moment of his sporting life			1
he is just one of hundreds of sportsmen and women who have battled to secure their place at the @entity19 as revolution and war waged around them during the @entity41 , toppling dictators from @entity43 to @entity6 and giving them hope , for the first time , for a brighter future			1
" these @entity9 will happen while there will be a new president so it 's a better feeling that gives a push to better represent our country , " says @entity4 , who would protest every day against the rule of president @entity26 until he was shot			1
" i wish that our participation in the @entity9 be powerful and be competitive so we can represent @entity7 in an honorable image			1
" after the @entity22 spring for many athletes in the @entity22 world this will be the first time they represent their countries free from the tyranny of dictatorship			1
in the past , sporting glory produced conflicting emotions ; on the one hand immense pride at flying the flag for their people ; on the other revulsion that success would be exploited as a victory for the regime			2
@entity76 knows that better than most			0
the @entity78 gymnast will travel to @entity79 despite fearing that he would never represent his country again			1
in 2009 he was handed a lifetime ban for insulting the former president @entity82 @entity82			0
" i tore the picture of the president right here , " he says in his gym , pointing behind to the wall			0
" there 's a big photo of him and i tore [ it ]			2
i have some problems with the federation and i see the big photo of @entity82 ... i tore it			0
and then they stopped me for one year and a half			0
" @entity76 , considered one of the greatest @entity22 and @entity99 floor specialists of all time , had previously traveled to @entity101 for the @entity102			0
back then he felt the heavy hand of the regime looking for success and reflected glory			0
" every champion in all sports had a pressure , " he says			0
" if you have an interview you must thank the old president and after you can speak about your performance			0
( you ) must thank the regime before the interview			0
it 's crazy but it 's the reality			2
" the president 's men eventually @entity76 was asked back to the team , but only out of desperation when the sporting authorities realized they had no gymnasts for the 2010 @entity99 championships			2
he refused owing to them keeping the life ban on his coach , who is also his father			0
" now i think only of my flag , my country and i am happy that my father is always with me to make this performance , because i can not image another coach but him			0
" it was in @entity78 that the @entity41 began , and @entity76 was soon drawn into the chaos , patrolling outside his building after joining a neighborhood militia			1
just 28 days later @entity82 was gone , exiled to @entity139 after over two decades in power			0
@entity76 could not believe it had happened so quickly , and that he was free once again to visit the gym , his gym , and dream of the @entity9 once again			1
" when we wake up , first day , my wife says to me ... ' he 's really gone , this dictator ? ' " he recalls			2
" i say ' i do n't believe			0
' before we [ were ] even afraid to speak in your own home , to critic the regime			0
maybe there is some cameras ? some phones to hear you ? " the @entity158 @entity157 the @entity78 revolution quickly spread across the region -- to @entity161 , @entity162 , @entity163 and beyond			1
in @entity158 a few weeks later , @entity164 received a message on @entity166 telling him to get down to @entity167			1
@entity164 is the fastest man in @entity99 , a sprinter who will compete against @entity157 in the 100 meters sprint			1
he put his training to one side and left for what he thought was a small protest against the hated police			0
it was january 25 and he arrived at the biggest , and most crucial , protest of the revolution			2
it was to be the beginning of the end for president @entity180			0
" i was there from the first day , " @entity164 told @entity0			1
" i completely forgot about athletics at this time because the entire country is going crazy and there 's no way to think about training or athletics ... last year was n't the greatest training year for us just because of the revolution			1
" @entity164 's schedule was badly affected by the ensuing chaos			1
he still trained when he could on the track at @entity194 in @entity195 but according to his @entity198 based coach it was n't enough			0
what little money there was from the @entity180 regime before -- peanuts given that the president would prefer to wrap himself around the success of @entity158 's national soccer team -- fell to nothing afterward			1
somehow the @entity158 authorities managed to find the money to send @entity164 to @entity209 for an intensive training camp			1
it is money that could be well spent			0
@entity164 's quickest time is 10.13 seconds -- competitive at this level -- and at the last @entity215 he had the third fastest qualifying time up to the semifinals			1
victory for the revolution now he is aiming for a medal that would mean more than personal prestige			2
" i was almost satisfied after what i had done in my life			0
i was like : ' i 'm the @entity99 champion , the @entity22 champion , i was holding the @entity22 record for a long time , " he said when @entity0 caught up with him in the @entity198 " but after the revolution i changed my mind completely ... if i 'm going to be the reason to make my people happy , even for one day , i would be happy for the rest of my life			1
" " now i am trying to be in the @entity19 final and not only that but the top three			0
i am going for it			0
this is what i am dreaming about			0
there is no way to give up			0
" @entity19 first as @entity139 names two women in @entity9 team the three athletes are going to @entity79 full of hope , an entirely different future for both them and their country now possible			1
already they have sacrificed much for a shot at an @entity19 medal , no matter how small those odds are			2
but regardless of whether they can reach the podium or not , there is now light instead of dark			0
" it 's a special feeling , after the revolution , " @entity76 explains when asked how it feels to represent @entity78 now rather than before			1
" you feel the victory better than before			0

in a special *collaboration* between @entity0 and @entity262 , we meet the athletes of the @entity41
despite revolution sportsmen from @entity78 , @entity7 and @entity158 will be at @entity9
@entity158 sprinter @entity164 hopes to compete against @entity267 in the 100m
@entity7 's @entity4 was shot in the stomach but will be in @entity79 too
