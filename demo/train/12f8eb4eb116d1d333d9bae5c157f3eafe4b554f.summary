-- would you pay thousands of dollars to spend seven days running under the scorching sun of the @entity3 , traversing shifting sand dunes and punishing rocky plateaus for more than 220 kilometers , with all your food and kit affixed to your back ? it may sound like insanity , but it 's exactly what daring men and women of all ages have chosen to do by taking part in this year 's iconic @entity16 ( @entity16 )			1
known as the world 's toughest footrace , the @entity16 began sunday morning as the driving sounds of @entity21 's " @entity20 " blasted through loud speakers to usher a record 1,024 competitors from nearly 50 countries into the heart of the @entity28 @entity27 desert			1
over the next few days , the grueling adventure will challenge participants -- the oldest aged 76 -- to test their bodies and minds as they take on whipping sandstorms and blazing temperatures of up to @entity35 in their epic journey across the desert			2
to toughen the ordeal , competitors are required to carry all their equipment for the duration of the ultra-marathon -- from food and sleeping gear to an anti-venom pump and glow sticks			0
three runners have died in the 28 years the race has been taking place			1
" some runners come here to push back their limits and brave the extreme to write their tale , " says @entity51 @entity50 , who founded the race in the mid- 1980s			1
" for a lot of participants , the @entity16 is an opportunity to break with everyday life and feel a sense of timelessness			1
there is even a spiritual dimension , a quest for answers to what are at times very personal questions , " he adds			0
" the desert magnifies the soul			0
" ' toughest race ' the exact route for the week - long event , which costs more than $ 4,500 to enter , changes slightly every year but racers have to complete the equivalent of five and a half marathons over six stages -- including a non-stop stage of some 75 kilometers that must be completed in 34 hours			1

they 're also guaranteed spectacular views and stunning landscapes , as well as sore muscles , blisters on their feet and the inevitable moments of agonizing despair as they battle with weariness and dehydration whilst snaking their way past rolling dunes , steep - sided uplands , dried - up lakes and abandoned settlements in the baking heat			0
" it 's the toughest race i 've ever done , " says @entity102 ultra-running champion @entity101 , who 's competed at the @entity16 four times so far			1
" that 's a combination of having to carry , obviously , quite a lot of weight on your back , the temperature and the terrain -- some of the sand dunes , their stretches are really quite long			0
it 's just unlike anything you can really prepare for or train for in another country , " she adds			0
' @entity120 ' yet despite such hostile conditions , the race 's popularity is growing every year ; due to high interest , competitors have to apply to enter @entity16 several years in advance			1
currently in its 28th consecutive year , the roots of the @entity16 can be traced back to 1984 , when @entity50 decided to embark on a self - sufficient journey across the @entity130 desert on foot , covering a distance of 350 kilometers over 12 days			1
that expedition had a major influence on the adventurous @entity51 , who realized that other people would be interested in taking on similar challenges			0
so in 1986 @entity50 returned to @entity137 to organize the very first edition of the ultra marathon , completed that year by 23 pioneering runners			1
twenty - eight years and more than 12,000 participants later , the @entity16 has grown to become a major endurance event whose model has been copied by several other races			1
" it 's the @entity146 , " says @entity101			0
" there are so many multi-stage races these days , but the @entity16 is definitely the one that sets a bar for others to try to live up to , " she adds			2
" the organization that goes into it is quite remarkable			0
" indeed , putting the race together requires months of preparations and a plethora of resources : 120,000 liters of mineral water , 6.5 kilometers of @entity159 , 400 support staff , 270 berber and @entity3 tents , 100 all - terrain vehicles , 52 medical staff , 23 buses , 19,000 compresses and 6,000 painkillers			2
in addition , the organizers have two helicopters , one @entity172 plane and six commercial planes at their disposal			0
' 1,000 people , 1,000 stories ' so , what is it that 's attracting people from across the world to the vast unforgiving sands of the @entity3 , turning the @entity16 into such a big event ? organizers say it is the tantalizing cocktail of testing one 's limits and achieving the unattainable , helped by the haunting surroundings of the desert , which have shrouded the @entity16 with a veil of mystique over the years , making it appeal to all kinds of thrill seekers			1

former competitors include @entity102 rowing legend @entity204 , who completed the @entity16 in 2010			2
but the race 's extraordinary concept is also a major draw for anyone with an audacious spirit			2
over the years , a diverse caravan of novice runners , amateur athletes , enthusiastic 16 - year - olds , spry septuagenarians and even visually impaired and partially paralyzed people have all converged on the @entity16 to test their limits , mark an occasion or escape briefly from their regular lives			1
" of the 1,000 people [ in the race ] , you can be sure there are 1,000 stories , " says @entity219 , member of the @entity16 organizing team			1
he adds that more than just an endurance event , the race often becomes a breeding ground for lifelong friendships amongst runners			2
" there is something magic inside the marathon because everybody is the same level , " says sepulchre			0
" you can be a good runner , a bad runner ... you can be the most rich , or the most poor guy , [ here ] you are in the same level and that 's something unique			0
" the running is obviously amazing but a large part of it is also the camaraderie you have with your tent mates			0
" @entity101 even met her partner at the race			2
" you share a tent with the same people for a week and it 's really nice and you all help each other through			0
