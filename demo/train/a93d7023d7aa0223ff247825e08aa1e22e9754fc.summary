" 2 @entity166 cases moved to @entity180 @entity241 : the goalie of the @entity244 hockey team talked for the first time this week to the @entity246 about the death of his 2 - month - old son who died last august from respiratory complications			1

the newspaper reports that he had lost the position when he was replaced by a rookie last spring			0
sports psychologist @entity264 says that being a goalie requires " the highest level of concentration and focus			1
" @entity241 , an intensely private athlete , said , " i can remember sometimes , it could be a 2 - 2 game , and you start thinking about your son , or you start thinking about different stuff			1
" after his son died , @entity241 was named no. 1 goalie again , and he started a " saves for kids " campaign			1

the @entity246 : @entity244 goalie @entity241 copes with the pain of his infant son 's death what makes a person intriguing ? there are people who enter the news cycle every day because their actions or decisions are new , important or different			1
others are in the news because they are the ones those decisions affect			0
and there are a number of people who are so famous or controversial that anything they say or do becomes news			0
some of these people do what we expect of them : they run for office , pass legislation , start a business , get hired or fired , commit a crime , make an arrest , get in accidents , hit a home run , overthrow a government , fight wars , sue an opponent , put out fires , prepare for hurricanes and cavort with people other than their spouses			0
they do make news , but the action is usually more important than who is involved in the story			0
but every day , there are a number of people who become fascinating to us -- by virtue of their character , how they reached their decision , how they behaved under pressure or because of the remarkable circumstances surrounding the event they are involved in			0
we hear about them and want to know more			0
what they have done or said stimulates conversations across the country			0
at times , there is even a mystery about them			0
what they have done may be unique , heroic , cowardly or ghastly , but they capture our imaginations			0
we want to know what makes them tick , why they believe what they do , and why they did what they did			0
