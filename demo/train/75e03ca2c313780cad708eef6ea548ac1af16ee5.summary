@entity0 -- the question most readers will bring to @entity5 's memoirs can be put into just two words : " @entity7 ? " here 's an abridgement of the former president 's answer , from pages 228 - 229			1
" there were state sponsors of terror			2
there were sworn enemies of @entity17			1
there were hostile governments that threatened their neighbors			2
there were nations that violated international demands			2
there were dictators who repressed their people			2
and there were regimes that pursued @entity29			2
@entity7 combined all these threats			1
... before 9/11 , @entity31 was a problem @entity17 might have been able to manage			1
through the lens of the post- 9/11 world , my view changed			1
i had just witnessed the damage inflicted by nineteen fanatics armed with cutters			2
i could only imagine the destruction possible if an enemy dictator passed his wmd to terrorists			2
" that 's the key point : after 9/11 , threats that previously glanced off all of our attentions suddenly rose to dominate our minds			1
here 's @entity5 again , from pages 152 - 153 , reporting on a discussion with @entity50 that occurred in october 2001 during a presidential visit to @entity52			1
" ' mr. president ... one of the bio-detectors went off at the @entity55			1
they found traces of botulinum toxin			2
the chances are we 've all been exposed			2
' the @entity61 had briefed me on botulinum toxin			1
it was one of the world 's most poisonous substances			1
... deputy national security adviser @entity66 explained that the @entity67 was testing the suspicious substance on mice			2
the next twenty - four hours would be crucial			2
" if the mice were still scurrying around , feet down , we 'd be fine			2
but if the mice were on their back , feet up , we 're goners			0
... the next day , @entity74 got a message that @entity66 was trying to reach her			0
' i guess this is the call , ' she said			0
after a few minutes , @entity74 came back with the news			0
' feet down , not feet up , ' she said			0
it was a false alarm			0
" i was working in the @entity55 in october 2001 , and i remember vividly the mood of doom			1
had you asked me then , i would have told you : i am certain i will die in the next two years			0
if it is n't botulinum toxin breathed into the air conditioning , then it will be a car bomb on 17th street			0
if not a car bomb , then a sniper will open fire inside the @entity89 where so many @entity55 staffers picked up their morning caffe latte			1
i wrote a new will that october			0
i doubled my insurance coverage			0
my wife and i started uncorking and drinking the best bottles of wine in the cellar -- might as well enjoy them while we still could			0
president @entity5 nicely describes the way in which our post- 9/11 fears became self - reinforcing			1
" years later , incidents like the botulinum scare can seem fanciful and far - fetched			0
it 's easy to chuckle at the image of @entity17 's most senior officials praying for lab mice to stay upright			1
but at the time , the threats were urgent and real			1
six mornings a week , @entity108 and the @entity61 briefed me on what they called the @entity111 , a summary of potential attacks on the homeland			1
" on sundays , i received a written intelligence briefing			1
between 9/11 and mid- 2003 , the @entity61 reported to me on an average of 400 specific threats each month			1
the @entity61 tracked more than twenty separate alleged large - scale attack plots , ranging from possible chemical and biological operations in @entity121 to potential homeland attacks involved [ sic ] sleeper operatives			0
some reports mentioned specific targets , including major landmarks , military bases , universities , and shopping malls			0
for months after 9/11 , i would wake up in the middle of the night worried about what i had read			1
" in retrospect , these @entity61 warnings look like a classic bureaucratic response : chagrined by their failure to thwart the 9/11 attacks , @entity17 's intelligence agencies overcorrected			1
on september 9 , 2001 , a state trooper in @entity139 pulled over one of the 9/11 hijackers for speeding			1
@entity143 , one of the four men who seized the plane that crashed in @entity146 , was driving 95 mph in a 60 mph zone			0
had @entity143 been detained , who knows how his fellow plotters would have reacted ? maybe they would have assumed their security had been breached and canceled the operation			0
but @entity143 's name did not appear on any watch list , much less any list shared with local law enforcement			1
having missed @entity143 , the agencies became determined never again to miss anyone			2
they careened from providing a false negative to generating hundreds of false positives			0
@entity5 mentions that in late september 2001 , @entity67 director @entity162 told him that there were 331 potential @entity165 operatives inside the @entity17			1
the october anthrax attacks intensified the alarmist mood			0
in the days after october 2 , 2001 , anthrax - laced letters arrived at the @entity169 ; @entity170 , @entity171 and @entity172 ; and the @entity174 offices of majority leader @entity175			0
altogether , 17 people were infected			0
from the memoirs of @entity5 , pages 157 - 158			1
" one of the letters containing anthrax read : 09 - 11 - 01 you can not stop @entity17			1
are you afraid ? death to america			0
i was struck by a sickening thought : was this the second wave , a biological attack ? ... the biggest question during the anthrax attack was where it was coming from			0
one of the best intelligence services in @entity121 said it suspected @entity7			1
" and now the key line , on page 159 : " we believed more attacks were coming , but we did n't know when , where , or from whom			0
... as time passed , some critics charged that we inflated the threat or manipulated alert levels for political benefit			2
we took the intelligence seriously ... " ireporter : welcome back , president @entity5 @entity5 's account of his decision - making in his @entity7 chapter will likely seem stunted to many readers			1
he offers considerable detail on the milestones toward the decision -- and yet readers will search in vain for the actual moment at which the decision occurred			0
on page 251 , he " was n't ready to move yet			0
" on page 252 , " i was deeply disappointed that diplomacy had failed			0
" on page 253 , " military action was my last resort			0
but i believed it was necessary			0
" the how is all there			0
but a big part of the why is here : " i remembered the shattering pain of 9/11 , a surprise attack for which we received no warning			2
this time we had a warning like a blaring siren			0
" the @entity17 had been accepting risks from @entity31 for more than a decade			1
suddenly those risks were now intolerable			0
and for all the grief and cost of @entity31 's removal , that particular risk now threatens the @entity17 no longer			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity249 .			1

@entity249 : @entity5 's memoirs help explain why @entity17 attacked @entity7
he says @entity55 was being briefed on huge number of threats
intelligence agencies *overreacted* after failing to stop 9/11 , he says
@entity31 was a threat the @entity17 could anticipate , @entity249 says
