-- lawyers for former @entity3 assistant coach @entity2 , who was convicted on multiple counts of child sex abuse , argued a motion for a new trial thursday			1
judge @entity8 , who presided over @entity2 's conviction and sentencing , heard arguments thursday at @entity13 court in @entity14 , @entity15 , but did not rule immediately			1
a motion for a new trial asks the trial court to re-examine issues it already ruled on in an earlier judgment			2
in october , @entity8 sentenced @entity2 to no less than 30 years and no more than 60 years in prison for abusing 10 boys during a 15 - year period			1
@entity2 , 68 , had faced the possibility of up to a 400 - year prison term			2
@entity2 's lawyers have argued that there was insufficient evidence to convict him , and that the court did n't allow them enough time to prepare for trial after the prosecution flooded them with documentation			1
defense attorney @entity34 testified thursday that he had been unprepared for the trial			0
but he also conceded that after reviewing the documents post-trial , he did n't see anything he would have done differently in defending @entity2			0
@entity2 's legal team has also argued that certain counts against their client were too broad and should therefore have been dismissed			1
opinion : @entity15 's suit against @entity43 is absurd @entity8 could easily rule that evidence presented at the criminal trial was so overwhelming -- the victims ' testimony , for instance -- that the defense 's concerns would not have changed the end result , said @entity52 , one of @entity2 's lawyers			1
the eight victims who testified , now young men , said that they were boys when @entity2 forced them to engage in sexual acts with him			2
the acts occurred , they said , in showers in @entity3 's athletic facilities ; hotel rooms ; and the basement of @entity2 's home , among other places			1
testimony was often emotional and graphic			0
jurors convicted @entity2 on 45 out of 48 sexual abuse counts			2
this first attempt to overturn the conviction based on ineffective counsel , a common tactic , will be tough , his lawyers acknowledged before the hearing			0
they said that if the court rejects it , they may launch appeals based on other arguments			0
" if you win on one of the appeal issues , everything probably falls , " @entity34 has said			0
" all we have to do is convince an appellate court that one of the issues we will raise is worthy of a reversal			0
" @entity34 and @entity52 have also filed a motion to have @entity2 's sentence reconsidered			1
the lawyers had attempted to withdraw from the case before the trial , telling @entity8 the day before jury selection began that they did not feel adequately prepared and that it would be " unethical " for them to move forward			2
the sex abuse scandal led to the firing of head football coach @entity95 and the ouster of the university 's longtime president , @entity97			0
@entity95 died in 2012 of lung cancer			0
the @entity43 slapped @entity3 with fines and sanctions over the case , but @entity15 's governor announced a lawsuit last week against the collegiate athletic board , saying @entity2 's actions were a criminal matter and not a violation of @entity43 rules			1
@entity0 's @entity110 , @entity111 , @entity112 , @entity113 and @entity114 contributed to this report			0

new : @entity2 's attorneys filed a motion for a new trial
new : the judge has not yet ruled on the motion
@entity2 , 68 , was convicted on 45 counts of sexually abusing 10 boys over 15 years
if the motion fails , defense lawyers may appeal the case
