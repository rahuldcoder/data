-- every day , more than 3,200 kids under the age of 18 smoke a cigarette for the first time			0
about 700 of those become daily smokers			1
those are two reasons , the @entity8 says , why it has launched a national education campaign aimed at preventing those between the ages of 12 and 17 from trying cigarettes or -- for those already experimenting -- from becoming regular smokers			1
" the @entity16 " campaign seeks to educate these " at - risk " teenagers by spotlighting the health hazards of smoking in a series of television , radio , print and online ads. these ads show the costs of smoking , from skin damage to gum disease and from tooth loss to a loss of control over their lives because of from addiction			1
about nine of 10 regular smokers had their first cigarettes by the time they were 18 , said @entity8 commissioner dr. @entity40			1
because teenage brains are still developing , they are more susceptible to nicotine addiction , the @entity8 said			1
" we know from research that there is a group of of youth -- 12 to 17 -- who are more vulnerable , partly because of the nature of their lives -- you know , chaotic lives , lots of stress , lack of control , " @entity40 said			0
some live with smokers , " which dramatically increases the risk , and so we 're hoping that we can potentially interrupt a deadly cycle , " she said			1
" we can help these teens understand the real consequences of smoking , the real costs of smoking to them , so that they wo n't take up smoking if they 're on the cusp and will stop smoking if they 've already started			2
" e-cigarettes : healthy tool or gateway device ? smoking as an adolescent can stunt growth , stain teeth and cause premature wrinkles , health officials say , and smokeless tobacco can cause mouth , esophagus and pancreas cancers			2
studies have estimated that every cigarette smoked shaves 11 minutes off your life			2
in 2009 , the @entity85 became law , giving the @entity8 the authority to regulate tobacco products to protect public health , including manufacturing , distribution and marketing			1
the law looks to prevent and reduce smoking by kids under 18 , the legal age to buy tobacco products			2
these new ads are the first of several planned education campaigns , but it 's not the only effort			2
the @entity103 is continuing its " tips from @entity108 " campaign with a new set of anti-smoking ads. one of the more striking ads features @entity110 , who had her larynx ( commonly called the voice box ) removed as a result of the ravages of oral and throat cancers			1
@entity110 , who had started smoking as a teen , died in september at 53 from complications of smoking			1
doctors support raising the smoking age @entity122 , the second - largest tobacco company in the @entity124 , runs a youth tobacco prevention program called @entity126 : @entity127			2
@entity129 spokeswoman @entity128 said she could not comment on on the @entity8 's new campaign until she saw the ads. but she says @entity126 has been up and running for more than 20 years and is used by more than 20,000 middle schools and community groups like the @entity134 and @entity135			1
" @entity138 is part of our company 's long - term initiative to transform the tobacco industry , " said @entity136 , a public policy director at the company			0
" over the past 20 years , youth tobacco prevention efforts and programs have had a big impact on reducing teen smoking , now at a historic low , and we are actively working on ways to accelerate the decline in youth tobacco use			1
" but " the tobacco industry has very aggressively been advertising for years , for decades , including to youth , " @entity40 said			0
" we think we can make a difference , because we have targeted messages that will resonate			0
" the initial response from teens who participated in focus groups to evaluate the ads for effectiveness , she says , has been positive			2
the agency plans to conduct a study following 8,000 kids between the ages of 11 and 16 and will do face - to - face interviews gathering data on adolescents ' awareness , attitudes and beliefs about smoking tobacco			0
will your children buy candy , gum or little cigars ? over the next two years , the @entity8 will launch additional campaigns targeting specific groups including multicultural , rural and @entity181 ( lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender ) youths			1
its goal is to reduce the number of teenage cigarette smokers by 300,000 over the next three years			0
" we will make an important contribution to reducing the toll of preventable death , disease and disability from cigarettes and tobacco use			0
it is astounding how the burden of tobacco continues to take a toll on the @entity124 people			0
" every year , some 480,000 people die an early , premature death because of tobacco use			0
it costs the health care system over $ 289 billion and also lost productivity costs , according to a recent estimate			0
and our youth are at risk			0
... so if we can reach them and stop them , we can prevent a life - long addiction and all of the concomitant disability and disease and early death			0
