-- ahead of the biggest game of his life , @entity1 has mastered the diplomatic language , if not his nerves			0
" i am completely focused on the first match			0
we have to do it , we can not lose , " the @entity10 midfielder tells @entity0 before boarding a plane from @entity14 's @entity13 airport that will continue his remarkable journey to the @entity16			1
this showpiece event will not feature @entity18 , @entity19 , or any of the other household football names that will light up @entity21 this summer			2
instead , teams such as @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity26 @entity25 will do battle for the @entity28 in @entity29			1
this is a tournament for the stateless , the marginalized and unrecognized by @entity31 -- the @entity30			1
no team has traveled further or struggled harder to make it to @entity34 than @entity35			1
the squad is entirely made up of refugees from the conflict that claimed over 200,000 lives , now living in the neglected camps of @entity14			1
eleven years on from the conflict , foreign aid and interest has dried up , with rations cut in half and the @entity46 ( @entity46 ) reporting over 50 % prevalence of chronic malnutrition in the camps			1
" life in the camps is better than @entity10 now , " says @entity1 , recalling that in his village even the sheep were killed and every house was destroyed			1
" but they destroy youth			0
we need to improve our skills and go to university			0
but there are no good schools or hospitals , nothing to do			0
we need to get out			0
" @entity64 is providing that release			0
the camps had always played the game , with cloth balls in the scorching heat , but with the support of @entity72 - based humanitarian group @entity71 , a new team was formed in 2012			1
thousands of hopefuls from 12 camps participated in tryouts , many traveling for days at their own expense			1
this was whittled down to a squad of 16 players , who traveled to @entity82 for the @entity83 just months after forming , and played their first match in a 15 - 0 defeat to @entity86 , before @entity87 scored their first goal in a 5 - 1 loss to @entity90			1
@entity1 admits that team - building was a challenge at first			2
" we were from five different tribes , all with their own language , so nobody understood each other and everybody was fighting , " the 25 - year - old says			1
" but after 10 days of training together we changed our behavior to respect each other , and became like brothers			0
" that spirit gave rise to their name			0
while the children of the camps wear the shirts of @entity112 and @entity113 , @entity108 borrowed its badge from @entity115			1
two years on , the team has benefited from regular training under professional coach @entity118			0
participation has grown , with 900 girls and boys playing at the new @entity122 in @entity123 , and several more are planned , while a women 's team will be launched next year			1
but despite such development , the team 's attendance in @entity34 was always in the balance			1
" everything came down to the wire , " says @entity130 - @entity129 , i - @entity71 's director of operations and community involvement			1
" we had a 72 - hour fundraising drive to raise $ 1,850 per player and coach			2
we made it in time with six minutes to the deadline to pay for the team 's airline tickets			1
" the stress did not stop there , with delays for visas again threatening their participation , as well as diplomatic complications between embassies , before the team was finally allowed to travel			0
that @entity108 's players will be lining up in @entity29 is a reflection of the international goodwill and support behind them			1
from the volunteer coaches and assistants , to donations received from football fans around the world			0
@entity161 basketball star @entity160 contributed the team 's kits , and a printing house supplied the logos free of charge , while @entity167 bent its rules for travel requirements			2
the team will have a difficult assignment in sunday 's opening match against tournament favorite @entity173 , of the @entity175 in northern @entity176			1
while the area was associated with the far - right @entity179 party , the team now promotes an inclusive message , represented by star player @entity181 -- brother of @entity176 international @entity183 , who will line up at @entity21 2014			2
" it 's the first time i play for @entity173 and i said yes straight away , " says @entity181			2
" i was born here , and lived here , so i feel a connection			0
it 's a great experience to play with teams from around the world			1
" @entity181 admits he knows little about his first opponents , but is keen to learn more			0
there are two main purposes to the tournament , says @entity30 president and former referee per @entity196			1
" we work to support ethnicities and isolated regions , and also to educate the world about them , to know they exist and who they are			0
to show their culture , heritage and traditions			0
" this is the largest tournament to date for stateless peoples -- replacing the poorly organized @entity212 events -- with a record 12 teams , and @entity196 sees limitless potential			1
" there are 5,500 ethnicities and regions that can not play			0
@entity31 have 209 members and we can easily double that , " he says			2
" @entity30 is only 10 months old and members say we have accomplished more than @entity223 did in 10 years			2
sponsors realize we are opening up a whole new market			0
there are 40 million @entity24 people without a state , for example			0
" the knockout rounds are expected to sell out in the admittedly modest 6,000 - capacity stadiums , and there is evidence of growing public interest in the outposts of football , away from the traditional powerhouses of the game			2
the story of @entity240 , the world 's worst international team , has generated a hit book and film			0
" there are so many teams who fall outside the @entity31 framework and it 's very valuable to give them recognition , " says @entity245 , an @entity247 football journalist who managed @entity248 , and now @entity249			1
" the @entity30 competition will give a lot of people a chance to express their identity through football and that 's a very valuable thing			1
" for @entity1 , it is priceless			0
" football has bought joy to a group that has not had good news in a long time			0
people in our camps are so proud and happy with this team when they see us representing them in the tournament , " he says			2
" it has made a lot of difference to our lives			0
after 11 years in our small tents , something like this seemed impossible , just a dream			0
" although @entity35 's players are desperate to bring the trophy home , perhaps their most important battle has already been won .			2
