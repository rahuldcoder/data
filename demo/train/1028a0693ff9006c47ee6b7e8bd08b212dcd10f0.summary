-- every @entity3 child should learn @entity4 , @entity5 or other regional language as the nation 's future is tied to the rise of the " @entity10 , " prime minister @entity1 said in a policy speech on sunday			1
" whatever else this century brings , it will bring @entity15 's return to global leadership , @entity15 's rise			2
this is not only unstoppable , it is gathering pace , " @entity1 said in a long - awaited policy white paper entitled , " @entity3 in @entity22			1
" the policy outlines 25 objectives @entity3 must achieve by 2025 to take advantage of @entity15 's rise to boost the wealth of @entity3			1
chief among the goals are that every child learn an @entity15 language , in particular @entity4 , @entity31 , @entity32 or @entity5 , and that they leave school having studied @entity15 culture			1
opinion : the speech every woman should hear '' children in kindergarten now will graduate from high school with a sound working knowledge of @entity15 , '' @entity1 said at the @entity44 in @entity45 where she unveiled the white paper			2
the prime minister said " a hundred years ago we spoke of the working man 's paradise			0
today we speak of the high school , high - wage road			0
we have always wanted to do it our way			0
" we long saw @entity15 as a threat to all this - racially , militarily , and economically			2
indeed this was precisely the moral paradox of the working man 's paradise			0
a hundred years ago , high wages meant white man 's wages			0
no more , " she said			0
while the @entity3 economy has ridden high on the back of the mining boom and commodity sales to @entity15 , @entity1 said the next economic wave will be pushed by the burgeoning @entity15 middle classes			1
broadening technology in agriculture and raising the global rankings of @entity3 's schools and universities will help meet increased regional demand from newly wealthy @entity15 neighbors , @entity1 said			1
" more middle class people than there are anywhere else on earth will want access to clean food , high quality food , high quality wine the same way we do			0
this is a huge opportunity for regional @entity3			2
and we want people out there ready , " she told a media conference after her speech			0
the @entity1 government will create a new ministry of @entity96 to drive the reforms across education , infrastructure , tax and regulatory reform			1
@entity3 's prime minister comes out swinging in sexism row if the objectives are met , @entity1 predicts about one - third of the @entity3 economy will be tied to @entity15 , up from 25 % in 2011 , and the average national income will increase to a $ 73,000 ( us $ 75,700 ) per person , up from the current a $ 62,000			1
the white paper notes that @entity3 will seek to stay competitive by abandoning its historic fear of low @entity15 wages and by becoming a " higher skill , higher wage economy with a fair , multicultural and cohesive society and a growing population			1
" @entity115 , the executive director of @entity116 at the @entity117 , says the paper sets out a deep vision for @entity3 's future " which starts with our young people at school			1
" " it encompasses reform in the education sector , schools , universities , vocational education			0
it 's a much broader and deeper plan than we 've seen to date			0
this is not a government report			0
it 's government policy , " she told @entity135			0
@entity1 also noted the broader geopolitical ambitions for @entity3 between military ally @entity138 and economic ally @entity140			1
in tacit acknowledgment of the criticism of her government 's deference to the @entity146 in @entity15 , she said " we have an ally in @entity138 -- respect in @entity140 -- and more , an open door in @entity151 and @entity152 , @entity153 and @entity154			2
" " we in this paper are focusing on the huge economic transformations happening in our region			0
we are not focusing on the mature economy of the @entity146 , " she later told a media conference			0
the @entity146 is @entity3 's third biggest trading partner and a recent survey by the @entity44 shows a majority of those polled believe the @entity146 to be @entity3 's most important security partner			2
opposition party members are broadly supportive of the government 's ambitions for deeper economic and social engagement with @entity15 , but skeptical it can be delivered			1
" it is full of laudable goals but not very many specific initiatives and certainly no commitment of money to any of them , " said opposition leader @entity171			0
" to some extent this government is scrambling to overcome some serious failures in its relationship with @entity15 , " he said , " most notably the early ban on uranium sales to @entity184 , only just reversed , and the catastrophic ban on live cattle sales to @entity32 , which still has ramifications			2
" polls show the prime minister 's goals for greater @entity15 engagement are broadly accepted by @entity3			1
according to a @entity44 poll , a majority felt @entity3 did not fall into recession in the global financial crisis because of @entity15 demand for @entity3 resources			1
however some 56 % thought there was too much investment from @entity202 and 63 % were strongly opposed to allowing foreign companies to buy @entity3 farmland to grow crops or farm livestock .			2

@entity3 *launches* a new policy aimed at tying its economic future to a rising @entity15
would require every student to study an @entity15 language and culture by 2025
creates a new ministry of @entity96 to drive educational and investment reforms
seeks to increase agricultural and university investment to cater to newly rich @entity15 neighbors
