-- from the conversations you 've had , what is your sense about how @entity5 feel about the prospect of any greater @entity8 involvement ? @entity9 : they 're divided			1
certainly on the @entity18 side , in @entity13 province and among the tribes that are supporting the @entity15 in @entity5 and @entity16 , they would see it as the @entity8 backing the @entity20			1
that would n't put the @entity8 in a very good position to play a mediating type of role , although it would be different if , through @entity8 influence , prime minister @entity26 was replaced by someone who was more tolerant and less sectarian			1
here in @entity34 , if you go and talk to the guys who are being recruited and who are volunteering to join the @entity20 militias , they are happy to have @entity8 support for their government			1
and there was perhaps a week ago more of a fear that @entity40 might arrive in @entity34 and that they really needed to be stopped in their tracks			1
but i would also say that there 's caution , because everyone knows what @entity8 involvement looks like here			1
for example , one @entity18 politician we talked to said that if the @entity8 come in , they would have to put right what they did wrong last time			1
what they mean is they left a sectarian leader in charge of the country , so if there 's any chance of keeping @entity18 onside if there are airstrikes against @entity40 , then it will have to involve getting rid of @entity26			2
the @entity8 have got to be seen to be giving something to both sides , if you like			1
what kind of support is @entity26 seeing in @entity34 ? @entity9 : it depends who you ask			1
he has taken a tough line , and a lot of people in the @entity20 community are answering the call to stand up and join the fight against @entity40			2
but i think if you asked most moderate , middle - class people , and certainly anyone in the @entity18 community , they would say that he is n't a guy for the future			0
they say that the way @entity26 has responded thus far to the crisis -- one that many people feel he created through sectarian policies -- has further alienated the @entity18 he should be trying to build bridges with			0
have you seen many visible signs around @entity34 of a city preparing for a possible assault ? there was talk last week of @entity34 being a target for militants -- how fortified does the city appear ? @entity9 : the area has been fortified for some time			1
it 's kind of like it was when i was here in 2007 , 2008 , 2009 , back when it started to get more heavily fortified			2
i would say there are perhaps even a few more checkpoints than back then -- there are certainly a lot of checkpoints at all the main roads , all the main intersections , every few hundred yards			2
@entity114 : yes , as you 're driving along the roads , at virtually every street corner there 's a man in a uniform sitting there with a gun			0
the other thing that 's quite noticeable is how many blast walls there are -- these very high concrete walls that are outside people 's houses , or across roads			1
and you 'll see someone 's house , but it 's surrounded by barbed wire and high walls			1
@entity9 : the other thing we experienced just today was when we were driving down the street by the river , and we saw an army patrol			0
and they will just suddenly close that street you are driving on , so you have to go another way -- there 's no way to talk them out of it			0
so street closures come at random			1
what has it been like trying to report from @entity34 , on the street ? @entity9 : the hardest thing for us has even been getting permission to film on the street			1
we 've been here for a week and we 're still trying to get that permission			2
as a westerner in @entity34 you stand out very clearly when you 're on the street , and you attract a lot of attention with a camera			1
so unless you have permission to be using it , you will be shut down very quickly			2
hundreds of thousands of residents from cities like @entity158 that have come under siege from militants have been fleeing the violence			2
where are they going ? is the government offering any provision for the internally displaced ? @entity9 : the government not so much , it seems , and we do n't see this so much in @entity34			1
most of the people that fled out of @entity13 have found accommodation with families , friends and others that have taken them in			0
they are very dispersed -- it 's not like they have collected in a particular area			0
the people that have just fled out of @entity158 , for example , have mostly fled to the @entity184 region where it 's safer and where there are displacement camps being set up			0
but in @entity34 , even though the fighting is only about a 45 - minute drive northeast of the city , people fleeing @entity192 , for example , are n't arriving here in perceptible numbers			1
@entity114 : we just did an interview with someone from the ( @entity199 ) office , and what he said is that what happens for people in @entity34 who have been internally displaced from areas where there is fighting is that they get brought into their ethnic communities -- they are seeking shelter in these places because they feel safer , rather than necessarily going to @entity208			1
many are seeking sanctuary in their ethnic neighborhoods , and these are very closed neighborhoods			0
how optimistic are people here that @entity5 can be prevented from falling apart as a unified nation ? do @entity5 you speak to care whether the country ends up being divided ? @entity9 : i think people want to be safe			1
i think the @entity220 , for example , have been able to take advantage of the situation and have taken control of the last big town that is important to them , @entity226 , and they have no intention of giving it up			0
so i think whatever the @entity5 is of the future , the @entity220 are going to want the @entity184 region , which has had some autonomy , to have even more autonomy and greater separation from @entity34			1
i think as the sectarian tensions rise -- and you 've already been seeing this over the past decade -- you will have , as @entity114 just said , people fleeing to their communities			0
and this means you 're going to have even more sectarian division -- the fault lines are opening up over sectarian lines			0
and at the moment there 's no indication that this government has the ability to roll back wholesale the gains by @entity40 and the @entity18			1
@entity13 and @entity250 are a prime example of that -- they took control of these places at the beginning of the year , and the government has been incapable of taking them back			2
it has basically just built very big checkpoints on the roads , essentially cutting them off			0
the government has just walled off connections to large @entity18 areas			2
and that 's probably quite symptomatic of the way this is likely to play out			0
but what this means is that any political compromise in the future is going to be short - lived , and may never be able to bring back the country to the way it was before			2
@entity114 : from what we 've been told , people that can afford it are trying to leave the country			2
we have just done an interview with someone @entity278 has known for a very long time -- he has reported on her story , and that of her family , over the course of a decade			0
and in that time , her husband was shot dead in early sectarian violence , her daughter was kidnapped			0
she only managed to get her daughter back by kidnapping another senior militant who then allowed her daughter to be released			0
and yet despite all this , it 's only now that she says she has had enough and that she sees no future for this country			0
@entity9 : her eldest daughter is a @entity20 who is going to get married to a @entity18 , and so they need to get to the @entity184 region so it is safe			0
then they are planning to leave the country			0
she has been through hell			0
and now for her this is it -- there 's no hope for the future of the country .			0

@entity5 are divided about greater @entity8 involvement in their country
blast walls , barbed wire and random road closures are common
getting permission to film in @entity34 is tough
there is no sign the government can roll back militants ' gains
