@entity1 's skylines could look a lot more uniform in the years to come , if a statement by a @entity5 official is to believed			1
the backlash against " weird buildings " escalated earlier this week when the capital 's vice mayor , @entity8 , announced that the city would be taking a greater role in influencing its structures ' aesthetics			1
the city plans to implement " building ordinances to govern the city 's building size , style , color and materials , " @entity1 state media reported			1
@entity1 's cities , with their huge growth and increasingly bold architectural choices , have been a boon to the architecture industry over the past decade or so , with eye - catching structures popping up across the country			1
however , following @entity1 president @entity32 's remarks , which call for an end of " weird architecture , " to a symposium in october , it seems as though there might be a politically - motivated directive at hand			1
the comments were widely reported in @entity1 media			2
@entity8 's announcement is ostensibly to allow urban planning a greater hand in creating public spaces and " a better cityscape " for residents			2
when contacted by @entity48 , the municipal government declined to comment further			0
" like a pendulum " some are not concerned			0
pritzker - prize laureate @entity51 , whose landmark cctv building in the capital is often used as an illustration in media reports of so - called " weird architecture " told @entity48 that there have been previous , similar edicts			1
" there have been periods ( in @entity1 ) where ordinances existed , there were mayors who insisted ( to put ) @entity1 roofs on modern buildings but it 's like a pendulum , " he said while attending a design conference in @entity61			1
he says he 's holding off making judgment until the updated ordinances were expanded upon			0
" i 'd like to see ( the rules when they are announced )			0
there was a rule that buildings had to be grey , and the @entity53 building is grey , and i do n't think it is diminished because of that			2
" @entity51 is quick to clarify that the " weird buildings " remarks were not directly aimed at his flagship @entity1 project			1
" the media has made that connection			0
no more weird buildings , it 's understandable if you look around and i do n't feel that @entity53 is a weird building so that 's my comment			1
" stifling creativity @entity61 - based architect @entity91 , project director at the @entity92 , however , decried @entity1 attempts to rein in creativity			2
" would n't ( the ordinances ) make everything pretty much the same ? then they 're not giving the young creative industries a chance to come up with new ideas or innovation			0
" @entity91 said that the proposed rulings would stifle what has been a playground for architects			0
" that 's setting parameters on creativity and this will limit or kill a lot of great ideas			0
from creativity there should n't be boundaries			0
for new ideas and new projects to take shape , thinking out of the box is essential			0
by putting parameters you 're limiting ( architects ) to remain in the box			0
@entity123 , from the @entity124 , says that @entity1 's unorthodox skylines are the result of a " judgment imbalance , " according to the @entity128			2
" these weird buildings are too alienated from basic architectural norms and ... have become super-sized art installations that jump on the desire and vanity bandwagon , " he told the paper .			1

@entity5 authorities announce plans to place *restrictions* on new building designs , materials
*vice-mayoral* announcement comes *shortly* after president @entity32 called for no more " weird buildings "
architecture in @entity1 cities has become increasingly bold and *outlandish*
*experts* are *divided* on the *potential* impact of the planned building ordinances
