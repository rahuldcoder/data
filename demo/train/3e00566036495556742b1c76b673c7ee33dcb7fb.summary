dr. @entity31 , a neurologist at the @entity32 , says when his patients learn they have @entity30 , he tells them it 's best to stop working			1

" i would encourage them to leave their employment			0
" @entity4 , a six - term @entity42 @entity41 , announced thursday that he will not seek re-election after his current term expires in january 2009			1
it 's not clear how long the senator has known of his condition			2
" for at least two years , i have felt very little impact from this disease , " he said in announcing his decision			2
but september tests showed the condition had progressed since a checkup in april , he said			0
" while the progression was slight , i had to consider whether i could in good conscience run for re-election and serve you as well as you deserve for another six - year term , " @entity4 told an audience in @entity55 , @entity42			1
a source close to @entity4 , 75 , says his physician at @entity67 " has a comfort level with his ability to finish out the term			1
" the source added , " those of us who work with him have not seen much deterioration			0
" dr. @entity73 , a neurologist at the @entity74 , says that of the 500 patients he 's treated for @entity30 , very few have been able to keep working			1
" at times they can shift to a different style of work that does n't require making big judgments , like being a paper boy , " he said			2
dr. @entity83 , a neurologist at the @entity84 , noted the difficulties the disease presents for people who make decisions on others ' behalf			0
" a lawyer would n't be able to best defend their clients			0
a stockbroker would n't be able to make the best investments for their clients , " he said			0
another neurologist , dr. @entity96 , said if an @entity30 patient is making " world - shaking decisions they should probably stop working			1
" he added some of his patients in less stressful jobs have been able to keep working but have had to scale back , leaving behind tasks that are too complex			1
in addition to problems with judgment , @entity30 patients have behavior and language issues , because of the areas of the brain that are affected			1
" they can be inappropriate with money			0
they believe every ad they see in the paper and buy everything , " he said			0
the doctors said first signs of the disease are often very unusual behavior or a change in personality			0
an affectionate grandfather , for example , might push away a grandchild looking for a hug			0
someone who 's always been very polite might become very rude			2
" someone who 's usually very adept and in touch with people might suddenly make inappropriate or caustic comments , like they might refer to someone who 's overweight as ' fatty , ' " @entity31 says			2
he added patients often do n't want to leave work			2
" one of the problems with this disorder is they often lack insight so they themselves do n't perceive the problems , " @entity31 said			0
there 's no cure for @entity30			1
treatment consists of managing symptoms with medication and in some cases , speech therapy			0
