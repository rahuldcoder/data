@entity0 -- in a move likely to further strain relations between the @entity5 and @entity6 , the municipality of @entity0 has given final approval for a controversial @entity6 housing project in the heart of a @entity11 neighborhood in @entity0			1
approval of the project paves the way for construction of 20 apartments being developed by @entity5 millionaire @entity17 on land that he purchased in the @entity20 neighborhood			1
@entity17 , an avid supporter of @entity22 building in @entity0 , purchased the land in 1985			0
to make way for the new housing units the historic @entity26 which was built in the 1930s by a prominent @entity11 family would be torn down			0
the @entity20 neighborhood in @entity0 has become an area highly coveted by @entity22 nationalists wishing to cement @entity22 claims to the land , and it has become a fault line in the public debate about @entity6 building in @entity38 areas of @entity0			1
every week hundreds of @entity11 , @entity6 , and international activists stage protests in the neighborhood to protest @entity6 government building policies			1
@entity0 was captured from @entity43 in the 1967 war between @entity6 and its @entity38 neighbors			2
@entity6 claims sovereignty over all of @entity0 , though this it is a claim not recognized by the international community			2
@entity11 want @entity0 as the capitol of their future state			1
in a terse statement wednesday , the @entity51 argued the @entity0 construction was actually approved in july 2009 and that the owners of the land merely paid a necessary fee last week which generated an automatic approval for the project to proceed			1
" this is distorted media information in order to create a provocation during the prime minister 's visit to the @entity5 " read the statement			0
the building plan , which was given municipal approval last summer , was met with great disapproval from the @entity5 which demanded that it be stopped			2
it was a demand , then as now , that fell on deaf ears			0
at the time prime minister @entity71 told his cabinet , " our sovereignty over [ @entity0 ] can not be challenged			2
this means that residents of @entity0 may purchase apartments in all parts of the city			0
we can not accept the idea that @entity22 will not have the right to live and purchase in all parts of @entity0			0
" @entity71 echoed the same arguments in defense of the @entity6 announcement two weeks ago to build 1,600 units of housing in a different @entity0 neighborhood			1
that announcement , made while @entity5 vice president @entity89 was visiting @entity6 , set off a diplomatic rift between the @entity5 and @entity6 that both sides are still attempting to iron out			0
@entity5 president @entity92 and @entity71 met wednesday evening in @entity93 to discuss @entity6 's plans for new housing units in @entity0			1
the leaders did not appear before cameras , and there was no sign of an end to the dispute			0
@entity102 , a spokesman for the @entity103 , called the approval " an intentional insult to the @entity5 administration " and works against " any serious indirect or direct negotiations " between @entity6 and the @entity11			1
@entity102 said the @entity92 administration " should put enough pressure on @entity6 to implement what has been written and issued by the quartet in @entity111 several days ago			0
" on friday , the @entity113 , the @entity5 , @entity114 , the @entity115 , and @entity116 , called on both sides " to refrain from proactive actions " and for @entity6 to freeze all settlement activity in an effort to promote peace talks .			0
