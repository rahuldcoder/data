the story of the @entity1 has taken on the power of myth			1
today , five decades after @entity5 erupted , it seems almost inevitable , a magical confluence of talent and timing			0
a group of scruffy musicians from @entity11 , a depressed port in northern @entity13 , become the biggest band in the world , known on a first - name basis ? they put out album after groundbreaking album , their influence as great as their popularity ? they dominate the pop culture of the 1960s and break up while still at the top of their game ? you could n't make this stuff up			1
but there 's been enough mythmaking , says @entity33			1
it 's time to get down to the facts			1
" it 's a story that 's lost all its excitement , because it 's been trodden down through too many bad tellings through the years , " says @entity33 , the @entity1 historian and author of such detailed works as " @entity41 " and " @entity42			1
" " i just felt i would disregard everything that 's been done			1
" the result is " @entity45 , " a mammoth ( 800 pages , not including notes ) biography of the @entity1 that 's just the first of a projected three - volume work			1
the book ends in 1962 , with the band on the cusp of stardom			0
( for those who really ca n't get enough detail , there 's an " @entity59 " available in @entity60 that runs 1,728 pages and retails for Â£ 120 -- about $ 190			2
) the @entity1 in color : unseen photos @entity33 , 54 , has immersed himself in original documents , listened to and read contemporary accounts and interviewed those who were there , all those years ago			1
he compares the work to @entity71 's equally monumental biography of @entity72 , which is now four volumes long and has just started the story of @entity72 's presidency			1
" this is a proper work of history , " he says			0
" and it needs to be done , and it needs to be done now , while the witnesses are still with us -- most of them -- and while access to archives is still possible			0
" he 's emphatic that " @entity45 " is n't a hagiography , the literary version of a @entity1 concert 's high - pitched screams			1
" it 's not about legends , it 's not about icons , it 's not about myths , " he says			2
" the book is anti-myth			0
" a little bit raw ah , but it 's a season for myths			2
@entity98 media is currently drowning in biographies and retrospectives linked to the 50th anniversary of the @entity103 assassination , and for all the attempts at hard - nosed history , it 's still challenging to watch videos of the youthful president and not be swept away by the yearning , emotional pull of what - might - have - been			2
the @entity1 , too , have become encrusted by an aura of nostalgia and wonder , as if subjects of an ancient legend			1
@entity33 is far from the first to try to get underneath the shell			1
@entity117 wrote an authorized take in the late ' 60s ; @entity119 published the essential " @entity120 ! " in 1981			0
just seven years ago , @entity121 published " @entity1 : the biography , " which is just as massive as " @entity45			1
" as the 50th anniversary of their " @entity127 " debut nears on february 9 , the marketplace fills with more -- not just books , but also a new music release			0
the 2 - cd set , " @entity131 -- live at the @entity135 volume 2 , " may in its own way be as revelatory as the books			1
here are the @entity1 from 1963 , when they were still a little raw , driving the motorways of @entity60 in the era 's version of an @entity140 van to fulfill the latest one - nighter on their concert schedule			1
for the @entity135 , @entity60 's broadcasting monolith , the group was energetic and eager - to - please , says @entity145 , who helped put together the collection			1
it 's a sequel to the recently re-released and remastered " @entity148 , " which originally came out in 1994			2
for one recording , during a bitter , snowy winter , they did a show in @entity153 and then drove to @entity154 -- a two - hour trip on a good day -- for their @entity135 take the next morning			1
another day they recorded 18 songs in seven hours for the @entity135 's " @entity1			1
" later they did 19 songs in a single long session			0
the @entity135 did n't play many records , so it was perform live or nothing			1
" they knew they only had one shot , really , " says @entity145 , who 's also written a companion volume , " @entity1 : the @entity167			1
" " you hear how proficient they are as a live group -- not only doing the unusual repertoire ( of covers on the earlier @entity135 album ) , but doing their own songs			1
" ' the biggest nickers in town ' indeed , they were amazingly versatile			0
one song on the @entity180 , " @entity181 , " is a @entity183 classic rearranged for @entity184 in late 1962 , but did n't come out in @entity60 until january 1963			0
the @entity1 somehow obtained a copy -- it probably helped that their manager , @entity186 , managed a record store -- quickly learned it and performed it on a broadcast			1
they were also known to adapt @entity98 favorites for cover versions or to give them ideas for originals			0
those kinds of talents are what set the @entity1 apart from their competition , says @entity198 , the director of the @entity199 at the @entity200 , who 's taught courses on the group			1
@entity198 mentions a variety of early songs -- " she loves you , " " @entity204 , " " @entity205 " -- that start out with fairly conventional structures but always have a twist somewhere : a drop to a minor chord , a leap to a high note			0
" most of what 's going on is something you 'd hear routinely in even the most mediocre of pop songs , " he says			2
" but they twist it a bit and they come up with something that 's innovative without seeming like it 's totally strange			2
" the @entity1 freely admitted borrowing from others			1
they had " big ears , " in the jargon of music aficionados -- they 'd listen to anything -- and tried to write their own versions of @entity98 hits			0
after all , their @entity11 colleagues were doing the same covers the @entity1 did			1
" we were the biggest nickers in town , " @entity233 told @entity234 in 1984			0
" though the songs came in handy for their own group , even @entity233 and @entity240 were under no illusions that the @entity1 would last			1
their long - term goal was to simply be songwriters for others , after all			0
" when they came to @entity98 , the people they most wanted to meet were people like @entity247 and @entity248 -- the @entity249 , " @entity198 says			2
" this was all really about setting up a lifetime of writing songs and being involved in pop culture in a fairly old - school way			0
it kind of morphed into something else			0
" see @entity258 's photographs ' they never existed in isolation ' of course , that 's what leads to the present mythology -- the " something else			2
" it 's all become wrapped up in a ball by now : the cheeky press conferences , the madcap lads of " @entity268 , " the psychedelic savants of " @entity273 , " the @entity271 business and the fade - out -- not to mention the tragic deaths of @entity240 's friend @entity275 , manager @entity186 and @entity276 himself			2
even the parodies -- @entity285 's " @entity284 , " @entity279 's 1978 novel " paperback writer , " the @entity281 -- have somehow buffed the legend instead of undermining it			2
no wonder there are entire festivals devoted to all things @entity1 , and have been for decades			1
for @entity33 , the biographer , that just means digging deeper to get to the heart of it all			1
" in life , there are those people who are always sticking their hand up saying , ' come and see me , ' and maneuvering themselves more centrally into a story they were n't so central to in the first place , and then there are other people who do n't put their hand up at all , " he says			2
" you have to gain their trust , but then they 'll tell you fantastic things			0
and then a key element is not believing everything people tell you , because people embroider things			2
" ( for those who want to share their beatle - related stories , he has a page on his website for contributions			0
) after he returns to his writing desk , he believes he has several years ahead of him			0
volume 2 is 40 % done ; volume 3 might be 10 %			2
he expects the entire project may take to the end of the decade			0
through it all , he 's maintained great admiration for the group , of course -- they 've been his life 's work			1
but he 's careful to separate the men from the myth			0
" they never existed in isolation			0
they were always in the mix with other people , " he says			0
" they 're not legends			0
" in that , he echoes none other than @entity240 himself from his 1970 @entity343 interview			0
" we were four guys			0
i met @entity233 , said ' want to join me band			0
' then @entity346 joined , and then @entity258 joined , " he said			0
" we were just a band who made it very , very big			0

new biography tries to set @entity1 record straight
author @entity33 's " @entity45 " is *exhaustive* , and just first volume of three
@entity1 can be heard at career 's beginning on new album of @entity135 recordings
the group may have been groundbreaking , but they were still just people , says @entity33
