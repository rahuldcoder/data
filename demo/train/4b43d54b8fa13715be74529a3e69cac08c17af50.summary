-- you could likely count on one hand the number of writers who could scare the daylights out of you as effectively as they could cheer you up			0
and there are n't too many fingers on that hand representing those writers who could do both in the same story or even on the same page and convince you that they know what they 're doing			0
overheard on @entity0 : @entity13 was ' very down to @entity14 , ' or maybe @entity15 @entity13 , who died early wednesday at age 91 , knew what he was doing when he threw you into a dark place leaking menace and dread at every corner and when he lifted you into an enchanted realm bursting with magical properties			1
favorite quotes from @entity13 's ' @entity26 ' at times , these places -- light or dark , weedy or glistening -- were part of a distant past closely resembling @entity13 's @entity31 , @entity32 , childhood of blessed summer evenings and portentous autumn twilights -- evoked most memorably in his 1957 autobiographical novel , " @entity37			1
" at others , they were places conceived in a hypothetical future that often looked like a hyped - up version of the present day -- or at least whatever " present day " @entity13 happened to be writing			1
top five @entity13 films think , for instance , of " @entity52 , " a collection of short stories regarded as @entity13 's breakthrough when it was published in 1950 , even though he 'd been writing and publishing fantasy , horror and science fiction for at least a decade before			2
@entity13 imagined a red planet whose colonization by @entity55 brings upon its dry terrain both the sweetly nostalgic graces of early to mid- 20th - century @entity58 and some of the harsher aspects of human nature -- disease , war , bigotry and so on -- over time wreaking irrevocable havoc upon the native @entity65 and their civilization			2
news : sci - fi legend @entity13 dies @entity13 was hardly the first to use the medium of science fiction -- or as its more serious followers prefer , " speculative fiction " -- to engage social issues			1
but his success in bringing his futuristic @entity76 tales to such publications as @entity78 , the @entity79 and @entity80 broadened the audience for science fiction and elevated the genre 's standing in the literary mainstream			0
my last conversation with @entity13 wherever he was published , whatever he wrote about , @entity13 spoke to his readers in a style described by critic @entity91 in his introduction to the 1965 collection , " @entity90 " as " a curious mixture of poetry and colloquialism ... so brisk and economical that it never becomes cloying , so full of unexpected quirks that it is never boring			2
" interview : sci - fi legend @entity13 on @entity99 , ' monsters and angels ' some disagreed			2
even @entity91 conceded in the same paragraph that he " occasionally " found @entity13 's writing " a little too intense and breathless			0
" still others griped that they found @entity13 's blend of robust affirmation and astringent gloom too glib and calculated to please as wide an audience of soreheads and romantics as possible			0
but @entity13 's more intelligent and incisive readers found greater resonance in his writing than his deceptively simple approach evoked on the surface			1
@entity118 , others tweet tributes to @entity13 one such fan was the @entity122 fabulist and poet @entity123 , who in his introduction to his spanish - language translation of " @entity52 , asked : " what has this man from @entity32 done , i ask myself when i close the pages of his book , that episodes from the conquest of another planet fill me with horror and loneliness ? " and there was nothing calculated or contrived about @entity13 's blend of optimism and pessimism			1
the man who once wrote a guide entitled " @entity144 " ( 1994 ) embraced all his contradictions -- light and dark , elegist and gadfly , dreamer and skeptic -- as one with a universe whose perils and possibilities he greeted with the same open - hearted wonder			0
" i prefer to see myself , " he told an interviewer for the @entity156 in 2010 , " as the @entity157 , the two - faced god who is half @entity159 and half @entity161 , warning of the future and perhaps living too much in the past -- a combination of both			0
" but , " he added , " i do n't think i 'm too overoptimistic			0
" what did @entity13 mean to you ? share with us on @entity171 ! the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity174 .			1

@entity174 : @entity13 could mix menace with magical possibilities
he says @entity13 drew on his @entity32 *hometown* to *juxtapose* *familiar* things with the future
but his approach , deceptively simple on the surface , held social *message* along with dread
@entity13 died wednesday at age 91
