@entity1 authorities backed off a claim that a 22 - year - old man was connected to beheadings in a recent @entity6 video , a day after publicly identifying him			1
a spokeswoman for the @entity10 prosecutor 's office on thursday distanced the agency from a news release put forth by her office that identified @entity14 as the second @entity1 national believed to be an @entity6 terrorist			1
" we stated yesterday on precise and concurring clues about his identity			0
we never talked about formal identity			0
the investigation is still ongoing , " spokeswoman @entity21 told @entity23 's @entity22			2
@entity14 , according to the prosecutor 's office , remains wanted on a october 2013 warrant as part of an investigation into @entity1 citizens who had gone to @entity31 to fight with @entity6			1
why are so many young @entity1 turning to jihad ? the announcement leaves just @entity35 , who authorities said monday was in the video , released over the weekend , that depicts in graphic detail the beheadings of men whom @entity6 militants claim were @entity31 government pilots			1
it also shows the aftermath of another beheading in which the victim in not clearly recognizable , but that the @entity48 government says was @entity48 aid worker @entity49			0
public prosecutor @entity51 described @entity35 -- who went to @entity31 in 2013 and visited @entity52 the previous year -- as a " self - radicalized " jihadist who traveled to the region under the guise of a humanitarian mission			0
he was known to @entity1 security services as far back as 2011 , the prosecutor said			1

how foreign fighters are bolstering @entity6 intelligence estimates indicate that more than 100 of the foreign fighters in @entity68 and @entity31 have come from the @entity48			2

this influx has spurred concerns that some of these fighters could bring the fight back home , perhaps with attacks inside @entity88 nations			0
those worries have been heightened by the group 's brutal tactics against foe and civilians alike , such as raping , enslaving and selling @entity68 women belonging to the @entity97 religious minority			0
last week , a @entity99 panel stated what many consider obvious : @entity6 has committed war crimes and crimes against humanity in @entity31			2
@entity97 women ' treated like cattle ' the @entity71 is fighting back , with many countries -- including @entity1 -- allying with @entity68 to conduct airstrikes targeting @entity6 in that country			1
the @entity48 has also led airstrikes going after the group in @entity31			0
