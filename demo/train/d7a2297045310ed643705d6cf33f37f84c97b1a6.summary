-- watch a movie from acclaimed @entity4 animators @entity5 , and you might see a boy turn into a flying dragon , a deer morph into a monstrous god , or a fish transform into a young girl			1
but with the retirement last year of @entity14 , the studio 's legendary co-founder , signs suggest the venerable and inimitable company is headed for a transformation of its own			1
in a @entity4 tv interview last friday , @entity5 co-founder @entity18 said the firm needed to " think about its future , " and would be " changing the way we make ( animation )			1
" he also speculated that @entity14 might " make something again , " though it might be a no more than a short film for the @entity5 museum			1
@entity18 's comments followed his own remarks from early last week , when he said @entity5 would take a " brief break , " leading to panicked online speculation that the studio was about to close			1
a @entity5 representative told @entity0 the speculation was untrue , saying " @entity5 has decided nothing officially for the future of the studio			1
" yet after concluding nearly three decades with @entity14 at the helm , the fate of the company suddenly looks uncertain			1
the secret to @entity5 's longevity the studio has been producing hand - drawn animated films for decades , sticking to old - school , painstaking frame - by - frame methods even as other studios have long embraced computer - aided animation and @entity48			1
every one of @entity5 's hits -- from " @entity50 " ( 1988 ) to " @entity51 " ( 2013 ) features a signature artistic style -- delicately rendered characters , exquisitely crafted environments , and an effortless sensation of movement			2
anime expert @entity57 says @entity5 has been able to perfect its hand - drawn tradition because it has employed the same animators for a very long time -- unlike many other studios , which rely on per - project contracts and short - term piecework			1
" this means @entity5 can be sure of a consistent quality of artistry and craftsmanship , " she said			2
but as @entity5 's staff ages , the firm must figure out how to carry on with younger talent			1
@entity57 says the @entity4 studio has focused for decades on " the personal visions of two remarkable directors , " @entity14 and @entity75 -- both now in their 70s			2
" ( @entity5 ) is like a great violin , a stradivarius maybe , in the hands of two great musicians			2
but when those musicians retire it has to be passed on to new players or else falls silent , because its structure is expensive to maintain			0
" what 's next ? the big question : can anybody succeed @entity14 ? " @entity5 has young creators , @entity89 and @entity90 , " @entity5 's representative told @entity0			1
" they are continuing to work for the studio			0
" but the films of @entity89 , -- @entity14 's 47 - year - old son -- and @entity90 , 41 , have yet to achieve anywhere the success of the elder @entity14 's work			2
@entity14 's 2001 epic , " spirited away , " grossed a record - breaking $ 274 million worldwide and took home the @entity99			2
in 2013 , @entity14 's swansong " @entity51 , " made over $ 117 million			0
by contrast , the studio 's newest film , " when @entity103 was there , " directed by @entity90 , is only expected to make $ 36 million			0
@entity89 's 2013 " @entity106 " made about $ 61 million			0
that 's why the studio must now perform a sober self re-evaluation after enjoying years of steady success			0
" we wanted to make a dream company , " said @entity18			0
" we were able to realize ( that dream ) to some extent and we 're very happy about that			0
but now we 're at a point where we 've got to think about what we 'll do next			0
" should fans be worried ? @entity57 says @entity5 's tradition of hand - drawn animation should survive , as long as audiences " accept the high costs and the demands it places on the workers involved			0
" " art is viable as long as people are willing to make it and buy it			0
" @entity0 's @entity130 contributed to this report .			0
