-- to all the locals who have been hoarding the following beaches , please forgive us			1
but c'mon , how can you really sleep at night , knowing you 're sending all those well - meaning tourists to the same old beaches with the same old towel - to - towel crowds , the same old overflowing trash cans and the same old high - rise hotels blocking the view ? is it really fair that you keep these gifts from @entity14 all to yourself ? so , yeah , the jig is up			1
as for the rest of you , you can thank us later			1
50 states , 50 spots : natural wonders @entity20 , @entity21 this tongue - twister of a beach ( the z is silent ) has miles of dreamy sand and knock - out views of both sides of @entity28 , but because getting there is complicated , you often get the place to yourself			1
slackers usually settle for its more accessible clones ( @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38 also front @entity28 )			1
what they do n't realize is getting to @entity40 is half the fun			1
it 's about 20 miles northwest of @entity28 , and the last two miles are along a narrow two - lane road			1
not only will you be humming a particular @entity46 tune as you wind through endless strawberry fields , but you 'll make a big dent in your bird - watching aspirations			1
@entity21 brown pelicans , red - tailed hawks , @entity53 kestrels and western snowy plovers are just a few species that hang out with the playful sea otters in the adjoining @entity58 estuary			1
during 2012 budget reductions , the state of @entity21 threatened to close this stretch of gorgeous land that was donated to the state by @entity64 schoolteacher @entity40 , but finally concluded its maintenance cost was next - to - nothing anyway			1
www.parks.ca.gov 29 beach photos that 'll make you drool @entity68 , @entity69 by law , visitors to this remote , 11 - mile beach are required to stay at least 50 feet from the wild @entity75 mustangs , but nobody bothered to tell the horses , who are curious about visitors who four - wheel drive in to this spit of land straddling the @entity83 and @entity84			1
with a delicious lack of paved roads , grocery stores , restaurants and hotels , @entity86 has little but wide , sand - packed beaches and a scattering of rental homes ranging from modest bungalows to million - dollar mansions with heated pools and hot tubs			1
it 's a perfect place to collect showpiece whelks , hike through preserved maritime woods or just set up a beach chair and chill			1
@entity104 @entity105 , @entity106 @entity107 would have felt right at home at this gorgeous beach on the north shore of @entity105			1
with stark white sand and black lava cliffs , it 's not only a study in contrast , but it takes effort to find and get to			1
whatever you do , do n't rely on @entity118 , which has been known to send seekers astray			1
if you do find the unmarked , unpaved path , just know that it 's steep , requires a good 10 to 15 minutes to traverse and when it rains , it gets slippery and the red clay is likely to permanently stain your beach shoes			1
locals tend to go barefoot			1
but oh , is it worth it			1
located between @entity128 and the @entity129 , @entity105 offers stellar views of @entity131 , @entity132 , a 15 - foot waterfall and nude sunbathers who have taken up residence on the east end of the beach			1
locals nicknamed it " @entity144 " and not surprisingly , there are no lifeguards or restrooms or beach umbrellas			1
@entity145 can be found toward the back of the beach near the 100 - foot cliffs			1
turn makai ( seaward ) at @entity149 ( 1/2 mile north of the gas station ) and turn right onto the first dirt road			2
the trailhead begins in the plum trees			2
@entity154 there are five main reasons you 've never heard of this wide , idyllic beach on the @entity159 : lions , elephants , rhinos , leopards and buffalo			2
most tourists associate @entity154 with safari and the @entity167			2
but with some 330 miles of @entity159 coastline , that 's a gross oversight			2
granted , it 's a long flight just for a beach , but why not combine a week at a @entity173 safari camp with one of the most interesting spits of sand on the continent ? @entity178 offers all the normal sandcastle building opportunities , but there are also other unique local attractions including @entity183 conservation programs and the 13th century @entity185 ruins			2
excavations of the ruins of this ancient @entity189 trading village have turned up beads from @entity191 , a @entity193 vase from @entity194 , lamps from @entity195 and scissors from @entity75			2
and , if you 're still jonesing for animals , @entity185 ruins are home to a troop of friendly @entity202 monkeys , and the @entity203 boasts some of @entity205 's best coral			2
the largest spitting cobra ( @entity206 ) in the world was also discovered here in 2007			2
@entity209 , @entity210 this long stretch of sand has everything you could ever ask for in a beach : spectacular views , soft white sand , an aquamarine paint palette of @entity220 blue			2
there 's even a stream leading into the woods and a hiking trail			2
in fact , the only thing it really lacks is large populations of humans			2
@entity230 , a @entity231 guy who let the cat out of the bag , says locals " who guard their secret beach rather fiercely " guiltily prefer to send tourists to the beaches at @entity239 and @entity240			1
once a bustling port with a sawmill , a hotel , a saloon and a 500 - foot dock , @entity241 today has nothing but scenery , overlooking the @entity249 , @entity250 and @entity251 , a glacial moraine that looks exactly like it sounds			2
the marked access road to @entity209 is just off @entity254 651			2
you 'll pass through the villages of @entity257 and @entity258 on the way			0
nps.gov / slbe / index.htm @entity261 @entity260 when developers set their sights on this 1,000 - acre barrier island off @entity266 , locals put up their dukes and an impressive fight to keep their beloved weekend getaway free from cars , bridges , roads and high - rises			1
after all , this seven - mile , baby powder beach is where they go to get away from tourists			0
the result ? there are a few private houses on the north end of the island , but there are no hotels or vacation rentals			0
that 's what makes it special : you have to boat here to enjoy it			0
the homes on the scrub - covered island are solar powered , sit on stilts and use water caught in rain barrels			0
when vice-president @entity299 rang in the @entity300 at his brother 's newly purchased home on @entity261 , he and wife @entity297 , like everybody else , came by boat			0
@entity305 and populated with deer , eagles , boars , the occasional panther , sea turtle hatchlings and iguanas , @entity304 is part of the @entity313			0
on weekends , a food boat docks on the south end to dish up icy drinks and freshly caught seafood			0
@entity319 , the @entity320 unless you 're a 2009 @entity322 swimsuit model or in @entity324 ' income bracket , you 've probably never heard of exclusive @entity325			0
as the @entity328 's @entity327 recently reported , this hook - shaped island is where billionaires go to get away from millionaires			0
two - thirds of the island is owned by wealthy @entity335 financier @entity334 , who invested $ 120 million to spiff up his about - to - debut @entity337			0
the resort surrounds @entity319 , but the beaches on the other 600 acres of the island are just as beautiful and surprisingly welcoming to average joes			0
so , if you can get by without a @entity349 - designed golf course , water spa treatments that require canoes to get there and mirrors that , with the touch of a button , turn into a tv , you can enjoy the nondeveloped part of this green hilly island that exudes a laid back @entity353 vibe			0
@entity354 , @entity355 only 100 miles from @entity357 , this low - key island is a million miles away in temperament			0
there 's nary a parasail boat or @entity361 in sight at 26 - mile - long @entity354			0
for that matter , you wo n't see any cars or banks or @entity366 's			0
just mile after mile of beautiful beaches , fishermen and a few palapas			0
oh yeah , and a school of whale sharks that hang out here between june and september			0
the cool thing about these 30 - plus foot monsters is they 're harmless and , if you ask nicely , one of the island 's 1,600 locals will take you out to swim with them			1
at the very least , you 'll want to nod at the flocks of pelicans and flamingos you 'll pass on the ferry from @entity384			0
@entity385 despite the lack of crowds on this string of beaches punctuating @entity392 's rugged coastline , skinny dipping is probably out			0
even though it has been nicknamed @entity392 's " banana belt " and many a daredevil has been known to swim under the majestic @entity395 , let 's just say it 's far from balmy and anyone who does n't want to resemble a @entity400 should probably stick with @entity401			0
more than 27 miles of trails wind through 300 - year - old @entity404 spruces and seaside prairies in this park that was named for @entity385 's first park superintendent			0
should you go , it 'll likely just be you , the seals , the whales and @entity14 showing off her finest work on more than a dozen stretches of spectacular beach			1
@entity415 @entity416 on a busy day , there could be 31 other peeps on this island 's undeveloped 7 - mile beach			0
there 's so much to do on this 10,000 - acre barrier island that those interlopers , the other 31 sharing the upscale resort 's grand total of 16 rooms , are apt to be busy drooling over the food at a clam bake or stalking the more than 280 species of birds on the 20 miles of wilderness trails			0
privately owned since 1760 when @entity435 colonist @entity434 bought it from @entity437 , @entity416 has been a rice plantation and , since 1908 , the personal retreat of the @entity441 family			0
today , it 's owned by relatives of @entity441 and @entity444 ( yes , that @entity444 )			0
everything 's included in the rather steep price of @entity447 on @entity448 ( starting at $ 450 a day ) from full moon beach picnics and cocktail cruises to face time with the on - island naturalist			0

locals tend to keep secrets when it comes to the best stretches of shore
@entity464 of @entity28 , @entity20 is likely to be largely *deserted*
@entity105 in @entity466 is actually called " @entity144 " by the locals
