-- how did @entity1 manage to build a tablet computer for less than the $ 199 price tag ? according to analysts ' estimates , the company could n't			1
in order to meet the low asking price , @entity1 will sell the @entity10 at a loss when it debuts on november 15 , analysts said			1
the @entity13 's largest retailer is apparently aiming to make up the costs by selling other goods , as it and other retail giants such as @entity17 often do			1
each @entity18 costs $ 209.63 to build , which includes paying for parts and manufacturing , according to technology research firm @entity21			2
that amount does not factor in research - and - development investments or marketing , executives for the firm have said			0
the preliminary estimate is typically based on analysts ' talks with people in the supply chain and does not change significantly once @entity21 is able to tear down the hardware for a thorough report , executives say			0
shortly after @entity1 's announcement on wednesday , @entity35 analyst @entity34 sent a note to investors saying @entity1 is likely to lose $ 50 on each sale of the fire			1
when factoring in marketing and other costs , @entity42 's estimate could jibe with @entity21 's			0
another analyst group , @entity45 , says the parts cost $ 150 , not including assembly			2
even if this estimate is accurate , the margins for @entity1 would be razor thin			2
@entity1 is making a potentially expensive entrance into the tablet market with its aggressively priced tablet			1
the company could make up for the losses with digital sales or physical products bought through its online store using the tablet			1
it could also heavily market the @entity62 club subscription to @entity18 customers			0
@entity66 , over what timeframe @entity1 will recoup its costs is unclear			2
" we 're very excited about tablet computers , " @entity1 ceo @entity69 said in a television interview last year , " because they have great web browsers , and they make it easier for people to shop at @entity1			1
" factoring in projections for all of the e-books , music and video that customers will likely purchase for the device , @entity1 is expected to turn a profit of $ 10 per @entity18 , @entity21 said in a statement			1
by contrast , @entity86 's @entity85 2 , the most popular tablet , costs $ 333.25 to make , @entity21 says			1
the @entity85 costs at least $ 499 at stores			1
not including @entity86 's expensive marketing campaigns , that 's more than $ 100 in profit on each sale with better margins for the more expensive models that have larger storage capacities			2
the strategy to lowball the price of a sought - after product in order to " upsell " customers on other merchandise is common for retailers , but is less so in electronics hardware			0
@entity104 has found buyers after slashing the price of its touchpad tablet to $ 99 , which it only did because the company is discontinuing the product			2
however , the business strategy is not unheard of			0
@entity113 was able to break into the video - game market by selling the original @entity115 , then the most powerful console , at a loss			0
in the next game generation , it took @entity120 years for the @entity122 's manufacturing costs to come close to catching the price customers paid			0
in that industry , console makers reap licensing fees from game software publishers			0
@entity1 , too , can try to make up its losses on software			1
it hosts an app store , digital music retailer , streaming video service and bookstore , all of which it takes a cut from			0
not to mention the piles of nondigital stuff @entity1 sells to be delivered to customers ' doors			0
the only thing missing from the @entity18 is an app to let the delivery person in .			0

analysts say @entity1 's @entity10 will cost more to build than $ 199
selling the tablet for $ 199 is very aggressive compared to the $ 499 @entity85
@entity1 is apparently hoping to make up the losses on media sales
