@entity0 ! april 25 marks the 60th anniversary of scientists ' discovery of the double helix			1
it 's also the 10th anniversary of the completion of the @entity7 , which set out to sequence the more than 3 billion letters in our genetic code			1
biologist @entity11 and physicist @entity12 realized our dna molecules form a three - dimensional double helix in 1953			1
but dna research dates back to the late 1860s , according to @entity17			2
@entity18 was the first to identify " nucleic acid " in our white blood cells ; his 1869 finding was later named deoxyribonucleic acid , or @entity16			1
others later defined the components that make up dna molecules , identified @entity26 ( ribonucleic acid , the other type of nucleic acid found in all cells along with @entity16 ) and determined that although @entity16 differs in each species , it always maintains certain properties			1
those findings led to @entity11 and @entity12 's conclusion , which paved the way for decades of dna discoveries			1
today we use dna tests to tell us about all kinds of things -- from @entity43 's baby daddy status to the innocence of a man sitting on death row			1
but genetic scientists are doing more than trying to prove @entity49 's existence			1
here are five cool things dna testing can do : map your family tree a $ 99 dna test could give you thousands of new relatives ( although if they 're anything like ours , we 're not sure why you 'd want them )			2
sites such as @entity61 offer to compare your dna to those they already have on record in hopes of connecting you to unknown branches of your family tree			2
@entity61 's test can also tell you your genetic ethnicity			2
" the new test looks at a massive amount of your dna ... and compares it to other @entity16 samples from around the world			1
by detecting similarities , we can trace back generations to connect you to the lands your ancestors once called home , " the site states			0
solve ancient mysteries no one knew where @entity83 , one of the most famous kings of @entity85 , was buried until his remains were discovered in a parking lot in @entity89			1
the remains showed evidence of battle wounds and scoliosis , but scientists were n't sure the skeleton was @entity83 's until dna extracted from the bones was matched to @entity97 , a direct descendant of the king 's sister			1
it was n't the first time ancient remains had been identified using dna			0
if it 's stored in a cold , dry , dark place , @entity16 can last for thousands of years			1
in 2009 , a dna analysis of some bone fragments showed two of @entity108 's children were killed along with the rest of the family during the @entity111 , despite speculation they could have escaped			0
scientists have even extracted dna from @entity114 , who went extinct about 30,000 years ago , in hopes of gaining insight into the evolution of humans			2
@entity119 , thou art stored in dna distinguish your mutt " where does @entity123 get his curly tail from ? why does he love digging holes in the backyard ? could i be doing more to make him happier and healthier ? your dog may not be able to tell you the answers -- but his dna can , " claims one dog dna site , @entity135			0
you 'll probably never figure out why @entity123 loves to eat your favorite @entity138 pumps ( other than the fact he 's a dog ) but you can figure out where he comes from			0
@entity135 will test your mutt 's dna against that of more than 190 breeds to determine his genetic background			0
" but why ? " cat lovers may be asking			0
" when you understand your dog 's natural tendencies , you can tailor a training , exercise and nutrition program to his needs , " the site explains			0
predict the future using blood from the mother and saliva from the father , scientists can now determine whether a fetus has any chromosomal abnormalities that could cause a genetic disorder			2
for example , dna testing can reveal if an unborn baby will have trisomy 21 , or @entity169			0
researchers are beginning to expand the field of prenatal genetic testing even further , using it to identify potential developmental delays and intellectual disabilities such as autism			0
genetic testing can also reveal risk factors you may have inherited from your parents , such as a high risk for breast or colon cancer			1
while this genetic risk factor does not guarantee you will get the disease , it does increase your chances ; knowing about the risk may help you take preventive steps			1
help you lose weight a growing body of research suggests that our ability to lose weight -- or gain 10 pounds by simply looking at a piece of chocolate -- is shaped in large part by our genes			0
scientists have identified several gene variants that may predispose us , and our children , to obesity			2
rodent studies have also shown that up to 80 % of body fat is regulated by our genes , according to time			0
that said , we would n't search for a customized @entity205 just yet			0
while there is a genetic component to obesity , our understanding of it is limited , says @entity212 diet and fitness expert dr. @entity210			0
researchers are still trying to figure out how genetics , nutrition and exercise are related so we can help people lose weight and keep it off .			0

@entity11 and @entity12 discovered the double helix in 1953
in 2003 , scientists completed the @entity7
@entity16 today can tell us everything from *paternity* to risk factors for chronic disease
