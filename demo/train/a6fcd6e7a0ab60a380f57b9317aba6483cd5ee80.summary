-- @entity1 glanced at the skies over her @entity4 village			1
storm clouds darkened the horizon , and rain started to fall			2
" i felt as if @entity8 was crying tears of pain , " @entity1 says			1
" @entity8 was crying because he knew what was about to happen			2
" it was a chilly tuesday morning on april 20 , 1999 , and @entity1 was on the run			1
village guards had warned her family that @entity17 paramilitary units were rounding up @entity19 muslims for execution			1
she ran out of her home with her family and fled to a nearby forest to hide			2
as the 11 - year - old @entity1 headed to the forest , she could hear bombs exploding and rifle shots crackle behind her			1
what happened next would leave @entity27 with nightmares that remain to this day			2
she would lose her older brother , @entity30 , and her older sister , @entity31			0
@entity1 , now 22 , is an internationally known peace advocate who travels around the world talking about reconciliation			1
yet she admits that talking about forgiveness is far easier than practicing it			0
" i have been struggling with this forgiveness thing , '' she says			0
" i can not forgive anyone because i do n't know what happened to my brother and sister			0

@entity57 forces are escalating attacks against the @entity59			0
yet many observers say only a negotiated settlement with the @entity59 will ultimately bring peace to @entity51			1
read more about other nations ' lessons for @entity51 but the challenges would not end with a settlement			1
@entity51 who saw their loved ones brutalized or murdered by the @entity59 will face the same challenge that @entity1 faces : how do i live again with the people who caused me so much pain ? the short answer is forgive them and move on			1
@entity1 's experience , though , suggests that doing so can take years and be excruciatingly difficult			1
@entity1 says that before she could forgive , " the truth must be spoken			1
" she wanted to know what happened to her brother and sister			0

@entity1 's family was staying in a homeless shelter with other @entity124 families			1

one day , @entity118 says he gave the kids crayons and paper			0
he asked them to draw what peace meant to them			0
the kids drew pictures of burned - out homes , tanks and guns -- except for @entity1			1

hating each other was normal			0
" the meeting that transformed @entity1 what helped @entity175 change was n't a march but a meeting with another @entity17			1
when she was 16 , she attended a @entity119 summer camp that brought together @entity17 and @entity124 youths			1
one day , a @entity17 teenager asked @entity1 to share her story			1
after @entity1 did , she noticed something odd			1
the @entity17 teenager was crying			1
and so were the other @entity17 children in the room			1
" that was such a powerful thing , " she says			0
" that not only changed my life , but all the children in the room			0
i realized that not all @entity17 are bad			1
" @entity118 , the @entity119 worker who first encouraged her , says he visited @entity27 at the camp and saw her change			0

" but [ @entity8 ] has n't helped			2
" her mother remains in @entity4			2
@entity1 says her mother wants to be there in case some word comes about @entity1 's sister and brother			1
but the waiting and the not knowing is brutal , @entity1 says			2
" we wish their bodies could rest in peace , " she says			0
" it 's difficult to wait every day , every hour , every minute for some news to come			2
" on some nights , @entity1 dreams of reuniting with her brother and sister			2
but not all the dreams are reassuring			0
