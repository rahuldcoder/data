and the controversial " @entity8 " hosted by the @entity9 is still on , the club 's president said , despite " grossly misguided comments " and threats aimed at supporters of the @entity7 , student group			1

all women will get 25 cents off those prices			0
the bake sale is meant to draw attention to pending legislation that would allow @entity25 universities to consider race , gender , ethnicity and national origin during the admissions process			1
" we agree that the event is inherently racist , but that is the point , " @entity9 president @entity31 wrote in response to upheaval over the bake sale			1
" it is no more racist than giving an individual an advantage in college admissions based solely on their race ( or ) gender			1
" similar events have been held at other colleges across the country , generally organized by college @entity48 groups			1
in some cases -- such as at @entity7 -- the plan sparked controversy and protests			1

" " more than half of the voices were female , " he added			0
@entity7 's student government , the @entity86 , held an emergency @entity88 meeting late sunday to discuss the issue and passed a resolution that , in part , " condemns the use of discrimination whether it is in satire or in seriousness by any student group			1
" " i completely support the idea of @entity9 -- or any students on campus -- ( having ) political discussion , " @entity86 president @entity98 said			2
" i think student members of @entity9 have a full right to express their feelings , but i do n't necessarily think this tactic is constructive			2
i strongly encourage them to engage in this dialogue in a more constructive manner , such as a forum or a town hall meeting			2
' but the bake sale is intended to be a direct , " physical counterpoint " to an @entity86 - sponsored phone bank -- also scheduled for tuesday -- during which students will be encouraged to call gov. @entity117 's office to support the legislation , @entity31 said			1
the @entity86 has endorsed the legislation , @entity120 185			0

@entity98 , the student government president , said she is concerned about students potentially feeling ostracized due to the bake sale			1
" i have heard that from numerous students who have said this makes students feel unwelcome on campus , " she said			0

" @entity98 described the situation as a " campus climate issue			0
" " @entity7 stands for a place where everyone -- regardless of race , ethnicity , gender , sexual orientation -- should feel inclusive , " she said			1
" i think they should be able to express their opinion , but keep that value in mind			0
" as for where the bake sale proceeds will go , @entity31 said the @entity9 are considering several charities			0
but " because of all this controversy , we do n't want to advertise the organization , " he said			0
" we do n't want to cause them problems			0
