-- voters in @entity2 vote sunday for the first time since the eurozone crisis left the single currency -- and much of the continent -- teetering on the brink of chaos			1
while the campaign has n't exactly set the world on fire -- voter apathy could prove a major issue -- what happens in ballot boxes across the nation has the potential to change the future of the euro , and of @entity20			1
polls opened at 8 a.m. ( 2 a.m. et ) and will close at 6 p.m. ( 12 p.m. et )			0
early results are expected shortly afterward -- but we will have to wait for a few days for final results			0
who 's in the running ? @entity27 , the country 's current chancellor , is campaigning for a third term in office			1
were she to win , she would be on course to overtake @entity32 as @entity20 's longest - serving female political leader			1
@entity27 , a physicist - turned - politician from the @entity2 , came to power in 2005 as leader of the @entity37 ( @entity38 ) , a center - right conservative party			1
initially she served as chancellor in a " grand coalition " of politicians from both sides of the political spectrum ; in 2009 she won re-election at the head of a conservative coalition with the @entity47			2

and while she does have detractors at home , she remains @entity2 's most popular politician by a long way -- according to the latest @entity64 report by the @entity65 , two thirds of @entity58 approve of her handling of the eurozone crisis			2
who is she up against ? her major opponent is social democrat @entity70			0
@entity70 served as finance minister in @entity27 's first government , a grand coalition between the @entity38 and the left - leaning @entity74 , from 2005 to 2009 , overseeing the country 's bank rescue plan			1
gaffe - prone @entity70 caused the biggest controversy of the 2013 campaign when a photograph of him gesturing with his middle finger graced the cover of a popular magazine			2
@entity27 's current coalition partners , the conservative @entity47 ( @entity84 ) , are struggling to connect with voters -- polls suggest they may even fall below the 5 % minimum vote threshold and lose their place in @entity2 's parliament , the @entity89			1

are there any newcomers on the scene ? sunday will mark the national election debut of two new parties looking to shake up the @entity58 political scene : the @entity104 and the @entity106 ( @entity106 )			1
all eyes will be on the ballot boxes to see whether they can secure the votes they need to win seats in the @entity89			0
the @entity106 , founded in april 2013 , is made up of so - called " euroskeptics , " opposed to the single @entity20 currency and to @entity2 's role in the bailouts of several struggling eurozone nations , which they see as a waste of money the country can ill afford			2
seen by many as a " party of professors " the @entity106 currently has between 2 % and 4 % support , just short of the 5 % it would require to take up seats in parliament			0
however , political commentators have warned it could damage @entity27 's re-election hopes by splitting the conservative vote			2

with up to a third of @entity58 voters " undecided " there are plenty of ballots still up for grabs			1
what are the big issues ? there 's just one , and to misquote @entity155 's campaign strategists : it 's the economy , @entity157			0
compared to many of its neighbours , @entity2 as a whole has continued to thrive throughout the eurozone crisis : it is the biggest economy in @entity20 , with a healthy manufacturing industry and the continent 's second lowest unemployment rate			0
however , not all of @entity2 's citizens are feeling the benefit : large numbers of people are reliant on low - paid " mini-jobs " which leave them struggling to make ends meet			0
the @entity175 are calling for a national minimum wage to combat the problem of the " working poor			0
" the @entity74 has also called for tax increases -- a proposal rejected by @entity27			0
read more : @entity2 playing beggar - my - neighbor with eurozone ? how does voting work in @entity2 ? germans get two votes , one for a local candidate , and one for a party			0
the @entity89 's 622 seats are divided between the two , with 299 going to local candidates ( under a first - past - the - post system ) , and the remainder allotted to politicians from party lists , on a proportional representation basis			0
to enter parliament , each party must secure a minimum of 5 % of the vote to win seats in parliament			0
votes given to parties that do not meet this threshold are redistributed amongst those who do			0
@entity58 politics is all about forging coalitions and alliances ; no single party has governed the nation alone since reunification			0
who will win ? until recently , the election looked like a slam - dunk for the popular @entity27 and her allies			1
however , the @entity47 ' dip in the polls puts the current coalition at risk			0
should the @entity84 lose its place in the @entity89 -- a possibility if the fledgling @entity106 splinters the conservative vote -- @entity27 would have to cement fresh alliances in order to remain chancellor			1
read more : is @entity27 the most powerful female politician ? the @entity38 has ruled out linking up with the @entity106 -- despite their mutual conservatism , the @entity106 's resolutely anti-euro stance contradicts the @entity37 ' policies			1
instead @entity27 could return to the " grand coalition " days of 2005 - 2009 , working with the @entity175 -- and @entity229 -- once more			1
alternatively , should they perform well at the polls , the @entity175 could seek to oust @entity27 by forming a left - wing coalition with the @entity97 and @entity94			1
why should those outside @entity2 care ? @entity2 is @entity20 's largest economy and its government has the leading voice in governing the @entity235			2
if @entity58 voters decide to replace conservative @entity27 with left - leaning @entity229 , the whole currency union could be affected			1
@entity229 is skeptical of @entity27 's austerity - focused policies and has said he would do more to encourage growth and investment			2
although they disagree on economic policies , @entity229 has made it very clear that should he win the election , he would follow in @entity27 's footsteps by demanding all eurozone countries stick to " sound fiscal discipline			2
