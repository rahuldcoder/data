go ahead , order the sushi			0
levels of radioactivity found in pacific bluefin tuna that spawned off @entity6 around the time of the @entity9 nuclear accident are far below anything that would pose a health risk and have dropped in fish caught the following year , @entity2 researchers reported monday			1
the latest findings follow up on a 2012 study that found radioactive cesium , a nuclear reactor byproduct , in tuna caught off @entity18 in the months after the triple meltdown at @entity9			1
the attention that study received led scientists to take another look at the data , said @entity25 , a marine science professor at @entity27 's @entity26			2
" people did not know how to translate that into a dose , or into what risk do i have from eating that tuna , " @entity25 said			1
" the paper that 's coming out today addresses that			0
" they found that anyone who eats the bluefin -- highly prized for sushi and sashimi -- would get about 5 % of the radiation they 'd get from eating one typical banana , a fruit high in naturally radioactive potassium			1
the results were released monday by the journal @entity46			0
even subsistence fishermen , who eat far more fish than the typical @entity2 , would receive a dose of radiation from the cesium isotopes released in the meltdown equivalent to a single dental x-ray , @entity25 and his colleagues reported			1
that translates to a " worst - case scenario " of two additional cancer deaths for every 10 million people in that category , he said			0
the doses were calculated from fish caught off @entity62 in august 2011			1
a follow - up study with fish caught in 2012 found the amount of cesium - 134 and -137 dropped by about half in those tuna , @entity25 said			1
" even if we use the higher concentrations , the concentrations we measured in 2011 , the doses to human consumers are very low , and lower than the naturally occurring radionuclides , " he said			2
@entity75 has a radioactive half - life of about 30 years , and traces of the isotope still persist from above - ground nuclear bomb tests in the 1950s and ' 60s			0
but cesium - 134 , which has a half - life of only two years , clearly came from the meltdowns , the researchers say			2
there are other reasons to worry about the @entity86 , such as overfishing and mercury contamination			2
anyone who eats a large quantity of bluefin over a long period would be more likely to see ill effects from mercury -- which can damage the brain and nervous systems of young or unborn children -- before facing the threat of cancer from radioactive cesium , @entity25 said			2
the three operating reactors at @entity9 melted down after the earthquake and tsunami that struck @entity6 in march 2011 , creating the worst nuclear disaster since @entity105 in 1986			1
the crippled plant 's owner is still trying to manage hundreds of thousands of tons of radioactive water used to cool the reactors , and scientists believe some of that is still seeping into the @entity113			0
the waters near the plant remain closed to fishing , and @entity6 has tightened its standards to keep any contaminated catch from reaching consumers			0
while the earthquake killed more than 15,000 people , no deaths have been blamed on the nuclear disaster that followed			0
in may , the @entity124 concluded that only a small group of people will face an additional cancer risk from the meltdowns , but more than 100,000 people have had to evacuate towns surrounding the plant .			0

scientists *linked* cesium from @entity9 to bluefin tuna in 2011
eating it would give someone about 5 % of the dose given off by a banana , scientists say
cesium in @entity86 caught in 2012 dropped by about half
