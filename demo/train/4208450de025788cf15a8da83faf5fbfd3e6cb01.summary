-- @entity1 got their @entity3 campaign off to a winning start with a 3 - 0 victory over newly - promoted @entity6 at @entity7			1
@entity8 , @entity9 and @entity10 all got on the scoresheet as @entity6 were reminded of the tough task they face to prevent making an instant return to the @entity15			1
@entity17 's side rarely looked threatened as they began their quest to regain the title from @entity20 with a confident showing			0
but it was @entity6 who had the first clear chance of the game as @entity26 met @entity28 's corner only to head wide from just six yards out			1
soon after , @entity1 began to dominate the game as the visitors sank deeper and deeper into their own half			1
they broke the deadlock on the half hour mark as @entity34 midfielder @entity33 lost possession and @entity36 fed @entity8 to power a low shot past @entity6 keeper @entity38			1
just eight minutes later the home side doubled their advantage due to some sloppy defending from @entity6			2
@entity43 's cross from the left was n't dealt with before it ricocheted into the path of @entity9 and the @entity46 international had the simple task of turning the ball home from six yards out			2
@entity8 should have grabbed his second after the break when a neat flick from @entity54 put him clear but though his shot beat @entity38 it rolled the wrong side of the post			1
@entity54 was taken off after an hour so new @entity60 signing @entity58 could get his first taste of @entity3 action , as 35 - year - old @entity36 began to pull the strings			1
@entity65 winger @entity64 was next to go close as he fired a left foot shot narrowly wide of the far post before @entity43 drilled a low cross across the face of goal			0
@entity8 's neat footwork allowed him a shot on goal inside the area as the game entered the final ten minutes but @entity38 saved well with his feet			2
@entity10 replaced @entity64 and he grabbed the third on 85 minutes with an angled volley into the far corner from a pinpoint @entity36 cross			2
after the match @entity17 purred over @entity36 ' performance			0
he told @entity83 : " he showed that even at his age you do n't lose what you 've got			0
" his range of passing and vision was marvellous and he 's still got the passion to play			0
he and @entity10 are blessed with something special			0
" three points is always important in your first game and i thought we controlled most of it			0
it was a steady performance			0
