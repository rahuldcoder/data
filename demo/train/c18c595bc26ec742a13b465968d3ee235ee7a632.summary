-- @entity1 suffered widespread power outages that plunged half the nation in darkness tuesday , the second massive power failure in as many days			1
as many as 600 million people were hit by the blackout , disrupting transportation and business before power returned			1
the breakdown of the nation 's power grid points to another global concern : the slowdown of developing economies			1
after the 2008 - 2009 financial crisis , growth of developing economies like @entity1 and @entity19 that pulled the world out of recession -- the first time a return to growth from a global recession was n't led by the developed economies like the @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29			1
so in the face of the eurozone debt crisis and tepid growth in the @entity27 , the slowdown of the so - called @entity36 economies -- @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity1 and @entity19 -- is a worrisome sign , said @entity40 , chairman of @entity41			1
" what 's going on is these countries ... is actually more important for the world than what 's going on in the eurozone , " @entity40 , who coined the @entity36 term , told @entity0 's @entity43 earlier this week			1
the reason ? the developing world has been creating wealth at a faster pace that @entity29 and @entity53			0
last year , the @entity36 economies added $ 2.2 trillion in economic growth to the world economy -- the equivalent of @entity58 , the 8th largest economy in the world , @entity40 said			1
" so it is quite disturbing that @entity37 and @entity1 have slowed down so much , obviously there 's this huge debate going on about @entity19 's slowdown , " @entity40 said			1
" what happens with these guys is a lot more important for all of us -- including , by the way , companies in @entity29 that are exporting to the world			0
" the two days of disruption in the third - largest @entity72 economy has raised questions about its investment in infrastructure			2
traffic jams snarled roads as signals were out , and at least 300 trains were delayed			0
on tuesday , as blackouts spread across the northern half of @entity1 , the @entity81 cut its forecast for @entity1 by nearly 1 % , estimating 6.5 % growth this year -- a far cry from 10.1 % growth in 2010			2
@entity37 only grew 2.7 % in 2011 , compared to 7.5 % in 2010			0
and @entity19 targeted its 2012 growth at 7.5 % -- the first time @entity90 set its growth rate below 8 % in eight years			0
as the @entity1 economy has grown , so has its energy appetite -- but as the blackouts show , demand is outstripping supply			1
" @entity1 's economic growth , especially the growth of the middle class and industry , is placing on the power grid has outstripped @entity1 's ability to provide the infrastructure it needs , " said @entity97 , professor at the @entity98 at @entity99			1
" while this is certainly a significant event it 's not something that is completely unexpected at a transition time like this in the country			0
" to help build better energy infrastructure , the government needs to open up to more public - private partnerships in the power industry , as it did for its booming telecommunications industry , @entity97 said			2
" i think over the next decade the investments of the government and particularly the investments of the private sector will be a big part of the solution here , " @entity97 said			0
@entity40 says the nation needs to open up its economy to greater foreign investment			2
" in @entity1 , frankly , they need to wake up and deliver some of the talk , " he said			1
" in @entity1 's case , conceptually , it 's easy -- let foreign investors invest in important parts of their country and sectors			1
if they do that , then a lot of @entity1 's problems disappear in a heartbeat			1
" not everyone is downbeat on @entity1 and the rest of the @entity36 economies			0
" in @entity1 , the average age of workers is 24 -- that 's exactly where @entity19 was 20 years ago , " said @entity144 , the founding partner of @entity145 in @entity90 , which advises firms on foreign direct investments in @entity72 economies			2
" @entity1 right now has an existing wealthy middle class of about 250 million , the same as @entity19			2
" the interesting thing about @entity1 is that you would go there to manufacture cheaply but also make inroads to the @entity1 market , " @entity152 said			0
meanwhile , @entity157 , executive chairman of @entity158 , says institutional investors worldwide still have a heavy appetite to invest in fast - growing , emerging markets			0
" a lot of people ask me if @entity19 is going to have a hard or soft landing , " @entity157 said			0
" and i say they are not landing			0
they 're continuing to grow and they 're growing at a pretty fast pace			0
" @entity0 's @entity43 , @entity169 , @entity170 and @entity171 contributed to this report			0

the blackout that *affected* 600 million point to @entity1 's infrastructure problems
@entity40 : economic slowdown in @entity1 , other @entity179 " more important " than @entity181 crisis
@entity1 's power supply has strained to keep pace with the growth of the economy
@entity40 : " in @entity1 , frankly , they need to wake up and deliver some of the talk "
