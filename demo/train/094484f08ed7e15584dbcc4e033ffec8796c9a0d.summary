@entity0 -- telephones are ringing off the hook at this office in @entity0 's capital , where a group of well - known activists are planning the final details of a protest on the other side of the @entity0 - @entity12 border			1
in a month - long @entity14 across the @entity12 , organizers say they will denounce what they believe are the devastating consequences of the fight against drug trafficking			1
@entity19 , @entity20 , will be the first stop on sunday for poet @entity22 and 70 other members of @entity0 's @entity24 on their trek through more than 20 cities in the @entity12			1
along the way , 40 people whose family members are among the tens of thousands of dead and disappeared in @entity0 's drug war will speak out about their experiences and work to create a new network with more than 70 @entity12 nonprofit organizations			1
" we want citizens to confront the blindness of politicians and their interests as much in the @entity12 as in @entity0 , " says @entity22 , who became one of @entity0 's most prominent activists after his son 's slaying in march 2011			1
the caravan will stop in sites north of the border that the poet considers key -- including @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 and @entity54 -- before arriving in @entity55 on september 10			1
" it will not be easy to cross the cultural divide to discuss subjects like drug legalization , the illegal production and sale of weapons , trafficking of migrants and money laundering , " @entity22 says			1
and the protest 's timing is another challenge , @entity22 says , noting that his group could struggle to gain attention during a fierce election campaign between incumbent @entity12 president @entity72 and his presumptive @entity74 challenger @entity73			1
still , he says he is confident that host organizations in the @entity12 will help them create " a narrative that can sensitize the @entity12 population about these problems			2
" the tough political climate , the intense waves of heat sweeping the country this summer and the large distance to cover -- more than 5,800 miles ( 9,400 km ) -- have inspired @entity22 to describe his upcoming journey across the @entity12 as an " odyssey			1
" for the mystical poet , who has become a key player criticizing @entity91 president @entity90 's strategy to fight organized crime , the caravan through the @entity12 is the latest leg of a journey that began after his son 's slaying			1
in march 2011 , 24 - year - old @entity22 's lifeless body was found with six others , crammed inside a car outside the central @entity91 city of @entity102			1
masking tape was wrapped around their skulls , faces , wrists and ankles			0
authorities believe all seven victims suffocated to death , and they have accused local police of working with cartel members in the slayings			0
after his son 's death , @entity22 said he would no longer write poetry			1
" the world is no longer dignified enough for words			0
they are choking inside of us , " he said at the time			0
while @entity22 stopped publishing poetry , words remain his weapon			2
the movement he leads surged to national prominence after thousands joined a three - day protest march culminating in @entity0 's central square in may 2011			1
since then , the poet has led a series of high - profile protests uniting people from across @entity0 to tell the story of the country 's losses and show the faces of those who died , disappeared or were displaced because of the fight against organized crime			1
" i think that our main accomplishment was to put victims in the center of politics , to say , ' these are not collateral damages			0
they are human beings , ' " @entity22 says			2
while he brought together witness testimonials as thousands joined his caravan marches across @entity0 , he also garnered attention from the country 's top leaders			2
the movement has met with congressmen and senators , with @entity90 and with the candidates who competed to succeed him			0
" these are unprecedented things			0
they are seeds that are going to produce fruits at another moment , " @entity22 says			0
but some of @entity22 's behavior -- like demanding the resignation of @entity0 's top public security official , then changing his mind -- has raised eyebrows			2
also , leading up to @entity0 's presidential vote last month , @entity22 was criticized for saying he planned to cast a blank ballot			1
and for some , his poetic language has been difficult to interpret			0
" i think that 's because a lot of poetry is misinterpreted or simply is n't heard , " @entity22 says			2
since the movement began , in addition to protest marches across @entity0 and meetings with top officials , there have been notable losses			0
members of the movement protesting violence in @entity0 have also become victims			0
in a three - month period last year , three members of the movement were killed			0
after these cumulative experiences , @entity22 says he feels deceived			0
@entity91 officials have said that more than 47,500 people have been killed in drug - related violence since president @entity90 began a crackdown on cartels in december 2006			1
but activists like @entity22 -- who is sharply critical of @entity90 's drug war strategy and the president 's approach to dealing with victims of violence -- say the death toll is far higher than government estimates			1
" the politicians do n't keep their word			0
they are overwhelmed by reality			0
on their agendas , the 70,000 dead do not exist			0
the war does not exist , " @entity22 says			2
even though @entity22 founded the movement and is its most identifiable face -- in 2011 he appeared as one of the protesters featured in @entity216 's person of the year edition -- he says he does not consider himself its leader			2
" the best way to destroy a movement is to focus it on one figure and practically deify him			0
through my mouth , i speak of the pain of this nation , but i am not ( the nation ) , " @entity22 says			0
now , after more than a year of protests , @entity22 says this caravan could be his last			2
after the protest through the @entity12 ends , the poet says he is considering returning to a spiritual retreat in @entity233 , where he spent time while his children were young			1
" i want to go , look within myself , find my solitude ... and end the pain ( i feel ) for my son			0

@entity22 : " we want citizens to confront the blindness of politicians and their interests "
