, this was done to acknowledge @entity10 @entity2 chairman @entity9			1
@entity9 said recently , " republicans are fretting the four dancing now ca n't beat @entity15 in the fall â € ” so their national talent search continues , " adding that the pleas had come from " the adults " in the party			1
the truth of the matter is i like the phrase " the adults " much more than " the establishment " because it gives much more insight into the current state of the @entity2			1
chairman @entity9 clearly meant to differentiate the adults from the many children in the @entity2			1
this caused me to get very nostalgic in thinking back to @entity31 dinners at my grandparents ' house in the 1950s			1
in rural @entity35 , the adults sat in the big dining room with real chairs , silverware , china , crystal and wine			1
whereas the children were relegated to sitting on the front porch with folding chairs , card tables , paper plates and dixie cups			2
we had our choice between orange pop and @entity52 's ( that 's root beer			1
) what really used to tick me off -- in fact it was the most scarring event of my childhood -- my @entity57 used to bring @entity58 french bread for the adults and we kids were forced to eat cruddy @entity62 sliced white bread			1
we were a rowdy bunch but deep down inside we always wondered what it would be like to sit with the adults at the big table			1
you 've got @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 , and all the rest of ' em in the dining room			1
out on the front porch is @entity81 , @entity82 , the @entity83 ( @entity84 and @entity85 ) , @entity86 , and @entity87			1
the adults have been trying to wire this thing up for some time and the children just wo n't behave on the front porch			1
you 've got @entity84 sneaking upstairs checking the medicine cabinet to see who is taking birth control pills			1
let 's not forget , just as @entity31 dinner was over we all had to get together under the oak tree in the front yard for the family photograph			2
and this was the ' 50s , we just did as we were told			2
but when you guys organize the family photo shoot in @entity105 this coming august you are gon na have a hell of a time getting all of the children to line up for the picture			2
@entity81 is not too happy about the way that you look at her			2
in fact , she has expressed a willingness to help out in @entity105 by indicating her willingness to serve as your party 's nominee			2
and if it is possible for @entity74 to get any whiter than he is , he will certainly turn to some shade of @entity119			2
then you 've got the problem of @entity82 out at the children 's table			2
he does n't play well with others			2
and it is gon na be hard to get him in line for the family photo			2
@entity82 is the kind of guy who ca n't seem to get the proper amount of attention and he 's not the " go along to get along " type			2
i see from the news that @entity73 has sent his super pac goons to snatch up little @entity84 and take him behind the woodshed for a little " chat			1
" that ought to keep him subdued through @entity140			0
but that child has built up a lot of resentment over the years and has proven to be quite pesky			0
my guess is that you could have more trouble ahead with @entity84			1
he is what my aunt would refer to as a " difficult " child			0
now the kids on the front porch have gotten restless and they are demanding entry into the big dining room			0
for the longest time you 've been able to keep these pesky brats at bay			0
every now and then one of them serves as some kind of an irritant -- @entity161 being a notable example			0
you let him sit at the big table at the convention in @entity165 in 1992 and he used the wrong fork to say the least			0
it strikes me that a lot of these people will want to sit at the big table in @entity105			0
and like @entity161 ( he 's still giving you guys fits ) they are gon na have bad table manners			0
@entity175 will want to give a speech on the evils of contraception			0
@entity82 is going to talk about the @entity179			0
and how are you going to be able to shut up people like @entity87 , @entity86 , @entity85 and the rest of them ? it 's enough to make me feel sorry for you boys			0
in the end , you have to get this thing to work out			0
and @entity73 is your only hope because @entity84 is going to be part of a seven - state strategy			1
he can carry @entity190 , @entity191 , @entity192 , @entity193 , @entity194 , @entity195 , and @entity196			0
you know as well as i do that if @entity84 is your nominee , you wo n't have two @entity202 candidates come to @entity105			1
you will have @entity204 candidates running away from the national ticket as fast as the devil runs from holy water			1
the whole thing will break down on you			0
in other words , you got a mell of a hess going on			0
and a well - mannered adult table conversation would never lead to making another guest uncomfortable			0
it seems that @entity76 could n't help but chastise fellow adult @entity73 for his stance on immigration			1
y'all are really having some problems			0
you adults better watch @entity82 because he could bust in at any time and demand papers for the help			1
you 're having what i refer to as a @entity229 / @entity228 moment ( by that i mean your problem is obvious			0
) other than both being from @entity233 , what could @entity228 and @entity229 have in common ? i 'm sure that you recall they once asked the great mr. @entity229 what was the worst thing about being blind , he instantly replied , " well you ca n't see			0
" @entity228 once observed the problem with conditions in the @entity233 prisons was the quality of the inmates			0
obviously , the problem you adults are having is the quality of the @entity2 voting in these primaries and caucuses			1
they are making y'all as batty as they are			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity250 .			1

@entity250 says the " adults " in @entity2 are *unhappy* with the four remaining candidates
he says they fear that none of them are capable of *defeating* president @entity15
@entity250 : if @entity84 wins nomination , @entity204 , @entity202 candidates will run for cover
@entity250 : the @entity2 ' only realistic choice is to unite behind @entity73
