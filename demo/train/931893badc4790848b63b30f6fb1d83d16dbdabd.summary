-- when a set of recommendations to reduce gun violence hits president @entity6 's desk on tuesday , it will trigger a new stage in a decisive political battle consuming @entity9			1
and it will show just how much @entity11 may have changed in the wake of last month 's massacre in @entity14 , @entity15			0
the proposals from a @entity18 task force may include some with broad support on issues involving mental health			1
but one of the most intense flashpoints is already known : the group , overseen by vice president @entity25 , is expected to support reinstating an assault weapons ban			1
" i would say that the likelihood is they will not be able to get an assault weapons ban through this @entity32 , " @entity28 president @entity27 said sunday			1
but the powerful gun rights lobbying group is gearing up for a fight , which , @entity0 has learned , will include an ad campaign			0
" when a president takes all the power of his office and is willing to expend political capital , you do n't want to make predictions , " @entity27 said on " @entity37			2
" @entity27 said he also does not believe @entity32 will pass a ban on high - capacity magazines			2
the @entity28 argues that such bans wo n't help stop gun violence and that they infringe on @entity49 rights			1
but sen. @entity50 , @entity15 , said the @entity28 's prediction is wrong			1
" i think that this issue is going to continue to move , " he told " @entity37 , " speaking from @entity14			0
" the @entity28 does not represent gun owners anymore			2
this is not your father 's @entity28			1
it represents gun manufacturers , " @entity50 said			2
while the @entity28 does receive large sums of money from gun makers , @entity27 insisted that manufacturers are " not our constituency			2
" " our constituency is twofold , " he said			0
" it 's the @entity11 people who want to own guns and use them legally , and it 's the @entity49 itself			0
" @entity25 told reporters last week , amid meetings with a wide array of groups , that he had never heard so much support for " the need to do something about high - capacity magazines			0
" sen. @entity77 , who is pushing a ban similar to one that expired in 2004 , has said she believes it will make it through @entity32			2
" all of the things that society regulates , but we ca n't touch guns ? that 's wrong , " @entity77 said in december after 27 people , including 20 children at @entity88 , were killed in @entity14 by a gunman who then shot himself to death			2
numerous mass shootings have involved high - capacity weapons			2
@entity6 set up the task force and instructed the group to have proposals by the end of january			1
@entity25 said last week he will have a set of recommendations ready for the president by tuesday			0
while the @entity28 , with 4.2 million members , holds a great deal of sway , it faces a country deeply concerned about the kinds of weapons that have been used in numerous mass killings			2
it 's also facing a new foe : a political action committee created by former @entity11 rep. @entity112 and her husband , @entity113			0
@entity112 was shot in the head in a mass shooting two years ago that killed six people			0
" with @entity120 engaging millions of people about ways to reduce gun violence and funding political activity nationwide , legislators will no longer have reason to fear the gun lobby , " the two vowed in a @entity118 op - ed last week			1
@entity6 made clear saturday that he 's ready for a fight over how to respond to gun violence			1
in his weekly radio address , he gave a list of challenges ahead , including protecting " our children from the horrors of gun violence			1
" " these , too , will be difficult missions for @entity11			0
but they must be met , " he said			0
the @entity6 administration will try to pass an assault weapons ban , an administration official said friday			1
sen. @entity141 , @entity142 , told @entity0 he believes that a ban on assault weapons alone , " in the political reality that we have today , will not go anywhere			1
" a strong advocate for @entity49 rights with an " a " rating from the @entity28 , he has expressed openness to changing laws but argues that other aspects of society should change as well			0
" it has to be a comprehensive approach , " he argued sunday on " @entity37			0
" sen. @entity157 , @entity159 - @entity158 , on sunday called on the nation 's largest gun retailers to " participate in a temporary moratorium on selling assault - style rifles until @entity32 has considered legislation to reduce gun violence , " his office said in a statement			1
" since the @entity172 massacre , sales of assault - style rifles have skyrocketed and are poised to grow even further during an upcoming ' @entity173 ' organized by extreme pro-gun activists , " the statement said			1
the group behind the event , scheduled for january 19 , uses its website to encourage @entity11 to " go to your local gun store , gun range or gun show with your @entity182 , @entity11 flags and your ' hands off my guns ' sign to send a loud and clear message			0
" @entity189 , one of the largest sporting goods retailers , suspended sales of certain semi-automatic rifles nationwide after the @entity14 massacure			2
another likely point of contention between gun rights activists and those supporting stricter gun control is a call for universal background checks			0
@entity25 has said several groups that his task force met with support such checks for all gun buyers , including those who purchase through private sales			1
@entity27 has also told @entity0 that he does not support instituting background checks for purchases at gun shows			0
he said sunday the @entity28 does support the idea that people who are ruled mentally incompetent should be listed as not allowed to purchase firearms			0
in the interview sunday , @entity27 complained that @entity25 's panel did n't really listen to what the @entity28 had to say			1
despite promises that the task force had not reached conclusions before hearing from all sides , " the conclusions were reached , " he argued			1
" we suspected all they wanted to be able to do was to say he had talked to us , and now they were going to go forward to do what they wanted to do			0
" another question facing @entity25 's panel is how to tackle images of shootings in entertainment			0
his task force met with leaders of the the film , tv and video game industries			1
it 's unknown what the task force may suggest as a response to what @entity6 has described as a culture that often " glorifies guns and violence			1
" meanwhile , across the country , @entity11 of all stripes are debating the issue in person , in town hall meetings , and in social media .			0
