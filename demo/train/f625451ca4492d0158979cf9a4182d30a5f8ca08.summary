@entity0 -- it 's less of a tongue - twisting jumble than the phrase " @entity5			1
" the sleek , slang word used by some to describe the health reform law signed by president @entity9 has taken on a roller - coaster trajectory of its own , first coming into favor with republicans as a criticism of the law , and more recently , as the subject of @entity17 efforts to reclaim it			1
the @entity19 is expected to hand down a decision on the law 's constitutionality this week			2
what the court has to say could shape the next step in the word 's evolution , experts say			1
it premired before the president was elected or even became the @entity17 nominee			1
and it premired long before the heated congressional debates over the law			2
around the peak of its use in @entity37 , rep. @entity38 , a @entity39 , rose in objection to the word being used in the @entity42			1
" mr. speaker , is it a violation of the @entity42 rule wherein members are not permitted to make disparaging references to the president of the @entity51 , " she asked on february 18 , 2011			2
" in two previous gentlemen 's statements on the amendment , both of them referred to the @entity5 , which is the accurate title of the health reform law , as ' @entity6			2
' " that month , a record -- which was broken a few months later -- was set for the number of times ' @entity6 ' had been uttered in @entity37 speeches : 272 times , according to an analysis by the @entity64			1
that analysis showed the word has been used nearly 3,000 times since its debut as a phrase on @entity69 in july 2009			1
the word was first put in print in march 2007 , according to the @entity71 , when health care lobbyist @entity72 penned it in a health industry journal			1
" we will soon see a ' giuliani - care ' and ' @entity9 - care ' to go along with ' mccain - care , ' ' @entity80 - care , ' and a totally revamped and remodeled ' @entity81 ' from the 1990s , " she wrote			1
it first appeared on the campaign trail in may of that year , when @entity84 distinguished his effort on health reforms as governor of @entity88			1
" in my state , i worked on health care for some time			2
we had half a million people without insurance , and i said , ' how can we get those people insured without raising taxes and without having government take over heath care , ' " he said in @entity91 , @entity92 , advocating for states to find free market solutions			2
" and let me tell you , if we do n't do it , the @entity17 will			1
if the @entity17 do it , it will be socialized medicine ; it 'll be government - managed care			1
it 'll be what 's known as @entity81 or @entity6 , or whatever you want to call it			2
" on the campaign trail since , he has defended himself from charges of similarities between " @entity115 " and " @entity6 " -- including a critique from a rival presidential candidate that the two amount to " @entity118			2
" perhaps confronted with the pervasiveness of the word , @entity17 began an effort to redefine it -- an effort which began after it was signed in the summer of 2010			1
by august 2011 , @entity9 was using the word in some of his own speeches			1
" so part of the @entity5 health care reform , also known as ' @entity6 , ' " he said at a town hall meeting in @entity125 , @entity126			2
" i have no problem with folks saying " @entity9 cares			0
if the other side wants to be the folks who do n't care , that 's fine with me			0
" a @entity1 / @entity135 poll released this month showed 43 % of @entity51 favor the law , 37 % think it too liberal , and 13 % oppose it because it is not liberal enough			0
@entity139 , @entity9 's 2008 campaign manager , commented in a march interview on @entity1 's " @entity141 " on the messaging of the law 's opponents			0
" we 've had hundreds of millions of dollars spent in propaganda against this law , just a torrent of money distorting it , " he said			0
that month , @entity9 's campaign encouraged supporters to tweet their support of the bill marked with a social media tag , " # ilikeobamacare			0
" but @entity155 , professor of cognitive science and linguistics at the @entity158 , does not see near - term success in attempts to associate the word with a positive connotation			1
" it 's possible but it 's very difficult , " he said			0
" @entity6 activates the conservative viewpoint , that part of the brain			0
" part of the trouble for @entity9 lies in the law 's official name -- the @entity5 -- said @entity155 , who writes about the messaging of health care politics in his new book , " the @entity174 : the @entity175 for thinking and talking @entity17			1
" " he could have called it ' @entity177			0
' it would be harder to argue against ' @entity177 , ' " he continued			0
" any cognitive scientist could have told him that was a dumb name			0
" @entity181 , professor of rhetoric and communication at @entity184 , puts significant stock regarding the word 's future in the upcoming constitutional judgment			1
" it was applied with a negative connotation , but were the @entity19 to uphold the law , @entity6 might overnight become a positive context , " he said			0
" just because something is intended to be framed in one way does n't necessarily mean that it will be interpreted that way forever			0
" the law 's most steadfast opponents may not change their views based on the court 's ruling			0
it could have an impact on the way the important november constituencies think about it			0
" you only have to convince the people who were ambivalent or are in the middle , " @entity181 said			0
but for now , the actual language of the law is not as important as the way it is discussed and debated			0
" most of the language people are hearing is not the law itself because nobody has read the law , " @entity181 said .			0
