-- defiant @entity2 president @entity1 has told one of @entity5 's top political organizations not to interfere in the world football body 's affairs after it called for a probe into his 2011 re-election			1
the @entity11 , a watchdog that oversees the @entity12 , had insisted on an internal investigation to determine whether @entity1 had exploited his position during last year 's election campaign			1
his only opponent , former @entity17 president @entity16 , pulled out of the ballot before a @entity2 investigation found him guilty of bribing @entity21 officials three weeks before the june 1 vote			1
the @entity23 , who was also a top @entity2 official , was subsequently banned from football			2
" the so - called @entity31 , they should take up problems they have in @entity5 not the problems they create in @entity2 , " @entity1 told reporters on friday in @entity27 , where he is attending the @entity29 tournament			1
goal - line technology enters final testing @entity1 's offer of an extra $ 1 million in funding to the @entity40 federation in the run - up to the election was also questioned by the council			1
the federation covers @entity44 and @entity45 , plus the @entity21			0
" i do n't understand why a political organization , in @entity5 or somewhere in the world , they have the right to ask @entity2 to enter into any activity -- especially in the election , " said @entity1 , who has been @entity2 president since 1998			1
" nobody from the football family has any concerns about the election			2
we need , naturally , also the acceptance of the political authorities -- but we do n't like political authorities interfering in our internal affairs			0
" @entity2 is fiercely independent , and suspends any of its 208 member associations if governments interfere in their operations			2
@entity1 , who turns 76 on saturday , also said it was strange that the opposition to @entity2 came only from @entity5 but not from @entity17 , @entity67 or @entity68			1
the first results of @entity2 's ongoing reform process -- triggered by corruption scandals ahead of the december 2010 vote for naming hosts of the 2018 and 2022 @entity74 -- will be made public at the end of march , he said			1
meanwhile , @entity77 has accepted @entity2 's apology after secretary general @entity76 told journalists the country needed a " kick up the backside " to be ready in time for the @entity82			1
@entity77 's sports minister @entity83 said he accepted both @entity76 's apology and a letter sent by @entity1 in a sign that cooperation between the two entities was back on track			2
he added that these incidents must not be repeated , so that preparations for the four - yearly tournament continue to progress			0
@entity83 also said @entity77 's president @entity94 had agreed to meet with @entity1 , although no date has been set			2
@entity2 has repeatedly expressed concerns over the pace of work in @entity77 on both stadiums and broader infrastructure such as airports			1
but last week , @entity76 used unusually strong language			0
in his apology letter , @entity76 explained that in @entity104 , " se donner @entity105 aux fesses " means " to pick up the pace			0
" unfortunately , he wrote , the expression had been translated so that in @entity109 it used much " stronger words			0
" the translation was a literal one			0
also this week , a congressional @entity112 approved a @entity82 bill that would allow the sale of beer at games -- one of the main points of contention with @entity2			0
it still needs to be approved by both houses			0
@entity0 's @entity122 in @entity77 also contributed to this story .			0
