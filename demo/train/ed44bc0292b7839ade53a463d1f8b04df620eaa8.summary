@entity0 -- as the number of @entity5 farms closed because of possibly contaminated animal feed grew friday , authorities said they had filed criminal charges against the company at the heart of the country 's tainted egg scandal			1
the company , @entity12 and @entity13 , apparently knew for months that fatty acid it was delivering to animal - feed makers was contaminated with dioxin , said @entity17 , a spokesman for the agricultural ministry in the @entity5 state of @entity20 said			1
criminal charges have been filed against the company , @entity17 said , " because they did not immediately inform " the agricultural ministry that dioxin levels surpassed the allowed amount			2

the country 's government has quarantined more than 4,700 pig and poultry farms			1
@entity38 and @entity13 laboratory tests from march 2010 showed they exceeded the ceiling level for dioxin , he said			2

they did not do either , " @entity17 said			0
government officials learned of the higher concentrations of dioxin in december , he said			2
several attempts to reach @entity38 and @entity13 for comment were unsuccessful			0

" of course that is no excuse			0
the conduct is still wrong , " he said			0

the 4,709 farms shut down include not only chicken and other poultry , but also pig farms , said @entity71 , a spokesman for @entity5 's @entity72			1
state authorities are quarantining all farms that received animal feed from companies affected , regardless of whether there is proof that the feed was contaminated , the ministry 's website said			2

about 130,000 possibly contaminated eggs were exported from a company in @entity5 to a food company in the @entity96 , where they were to be used in industrial food production , said @entity99 , a spokesman for @entity5 's @entity72			1
the @entity100 said a pasteurized mixture including some of the contaminated eggs was distributed in the @entity103			0
" the mixing of the eggs will have diluted the levels of dioxins and they are not thought to be a risk to health , " the agency said in a statement			0
