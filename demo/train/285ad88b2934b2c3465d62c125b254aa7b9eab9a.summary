entitled " @entity19 , " @entity5 -- the @entity21 - winning director best known for hit movies " @entity23 " and " @entity24 " -- put together a star - studded on - field dramatization that drew on @entity27 and @entity28 to chart @entity15 from its pastoral roots through the @entity30 to @entity31 , @entity32 and the @entity33			1
" the most leftie opening ceremony i have ever seen -- more than @entity38 , the capital of a communist state ! welfare tribute next ?

" thank @entity49 the athletes have arrived ! now we can move on from leftie multi-cultural crap			1
bring back red arrows , @entity27 and the @entity55 ! " he added minutes later			0

" @entity68 's @entity104 opening ceremony certainly was interesting , but it ca n't be said that it was superior to @entity38 's			1
it can only be said that each had its merits , " wrote @entity110 , a professor at @entity111 with 3 million followers on @entity95			0

there 's no need for contentious feeling			0
each has its own beauty			0
