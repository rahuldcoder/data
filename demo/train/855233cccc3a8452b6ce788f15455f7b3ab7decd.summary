-- over the past month , @entity2 's 29 - year - old leader , @entity1 , has threatened to attack @entity3 with nuclear weapons , declared a state of war with neighboring @entity6 and warned diplomats to evacuate the peninsula			1
the @entity10 administration has sent conflicting responses : first deploying bombers and new missile defense assets to the region , then appearing to back off and calling for dialogue with @entity16			0
this is a pattern the @entity18 has come to expect of all @entity20 administrations			1
historically , after major provocations , the @entity20 has returned to the bargaining table with @entity2 within , on average , five months of a provocation			1
and , of course , the @entity18 has typically cheated and raised further demands based on improved nuclear explosions and more capable missiles developed while leaders were in dialogue mode			0
we will not negotiate our way out of this one			0
on the other hand , sanctions and pressure have not deterred the @entity18 from its nuclear weapons path			1
is the @entity2 problem unsolvable ? no. but @entity20 policy must be based on realistic assessments of five factors : the @entity18 's intentions , the danger involved , the efficacy of dialogue , the approach to @entity41 , and the role of our alliances			1
1 ) what does @entity2 want ? this answer should not be so hard to figure out			2
the @entity18 's highest national priority is the capability to threaten the @entity20 , our @entity56 bases and our allies with nuclear - armed ballistic missiles			1
almost nothing will knock it off this path			0
do the leaders want respect , aid , lifting of sanctions and legitimacy ? of course : but the regime has determined that these come from owning nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles			0
the @entity18 's outrageous threats are designed to elicit compromise and restraint from the other powers in the region -- to frighten us away from imposing @entity79 sanctions for the latest nuclear and missile tests			2
@entity16 wants first to establish itself undeniably as the world 's newest nuclear weapons power			2
the regime may then freeze one part of its program temporarily , or promise a moratorium to receive food , energy and money , but the pattern has been consistent in later breaking away from whatever agreement was reached			0
if nuclear weapons were just about deterring the @entity20 , then a nonaggression pact or peace treaty might have some possibility			1
@entity20 administrations , from those of @entity10 to @entity99 , have offered @entity2 security assurances more than 33 times			1
but the regime needs these weapons to deter @entity41 , to keep its army loyal and to juxtapose its weapons status against rival @entity6 's enormous successes on the international stage			1
in the regime 's view , the weapons are indispensable to its survival			0
opinion : @entity2 endgame -- 3 scenarios 2 ) what is the danger ? @entity2 can be deterred			2
the young @entity1 's use of nuclear weapons would destroy the regime			2
the @entity2 might have everything to lose , but we -- as rich and comfortable societies -- have much more to lose			2
that is the leverage the @entity18 seeks to exploit			0
@entity16 's increasingly brazen threats could reflect the exuberance and inexperience of a young untested leader , but may also reflect the belief that threats can be made with greater impunity when backed by a handful of nuclear weapons			2
if the @entity18 is beginning to produce nuclear weapons not only from plutonium harvested from its @entity137 reactor , but also from uranium , then it may soon be able to produce more than one nuclear device , if not weapon , a year			0
this could lead to even more dangerous threats and demands -- including a possible repeat of the threat to transfer nuclear know - how to other countries			2
the other danger stems from the @entity18 's brinkmanship strategy itself			0
for five decades , the @entity18 has mastered the art of manufacturing crises and then pulling back from the brink			0
a @entity154 study found that within two months of a rupture in negotiations , @entity2 ratchets up another crisis with a provocation -- only to be rewarded with regional powers ' diplomacy efforts within five to six months			2
with increasing confidence in its nuclear and missile programs , will @entity16 come closer to that line ? will @entity1 feel pressure not to back down in order to prove his credentials as a marshall of the @entity2 ? will he pick the wrong targets and invite a @entity6 retaliatory strike ? nuclear weapons : who has what ? 3 ) the efficacy of dialogue the history of this torrid cycle of crisis diplomacy suggests that sooner or later , the @entity10 administration will be back at the negotiating table to rent a temporary cessation of @entity2 belligerence , just as previous administrations have done			1
but the definition of madness is to do the same thing over and over hoping that the outcome will be different			0
that is why the main track now has to be pressure			0
not war , but serious and sustained pressure by all parties that constrains weapons development and proliferation			1
4 ) the @entity41 calculus of course , sustained pressure is impossible without @entity41 's involvement			1
for the first time in years , there is reason to hope @entity41 may be more helpful			2
@entity203 is clearly exasperated with the @entity18			0
the new @entity41 leader , @entity204 , is more decisive than his predecessor			2
his new foreign policy team views @entity16 with a jaundiced eye after years of mopping up the diplomatic messes			0
even sacrosanct assumptions , such as the @entity18 's role as a vital strategic buffer for @entity41 , are being hotly debated in @entity203			1
but we should not expect @entity41 to coerce its troublesome client			0
@entity203 remains preoccupied with maintaining stability			0
@entity204 can not push through the economic package he hopes to table in the fall without support from regime conservatives , especially in the military , who favor the status quo on the @entity223			0
party chieftains administering the @entity41 provinces bordering @entity2 are critical to meaningful enforcement of tightened sanctions , but they care more about the flourishing border trade and investment opportunities in the @entity18 than implementing the will of the @entity79			1
such constraints make it difficult for the senior leadership to -- as @entity20 secretary of state @entity234 put it last week -- " bear down " on @entity16			0
this means the @entity20 must avoid the temptation to make cooperation on @entity2 a litmus test for @entity20 - @entity41 ties			1
doing so will only stiffen @entity41 resistance and result in disappointment and increased bilateral friction			0
it also risks increasing @entity20 ownership of the problem at a time when we want @entity41 to do more			1
instead , we need to persuade @entity41 to drop its parochial approach in favor of cooperation that is strategic , farsighted and genuine , and part of the overall framework of our long - term security relationship			0
we must convince @entity41 that @entity2 's actions are creating what @entity203 most fears â € ” greater @entity20 military presence in the region and enhanced trilateral cooperation with @entity262 and @entity6			1
@entity2 's missile capabilities 5 ) @entity265 matter a failure to stop @entity2 's nuclear programs will irreparably damage our alliances in @entity269			1
not so much because it will lead to a nuclear @entity262 or @entity6 , but because it will raise doubts about @entity20 staying power and ability to provide security to the region			1
any @entity20 outreach to @entity41 about development of a long - term strategy for @entity2 must be grounded in deep trilateral planning and coordination with @entity20 's allies , @entity6 and @entity262			1
indeed , all eyes will be on the new @entity6 president @entity283 as she lays out her vision to president @entity10 when they meet next month			0
her brain trust has talked about quietly reaching out to change @entity203 's view of its strategic equities on the peninsula			0
this argument will be more persuasive only if it is grounded in unprecedented levels of @entity20 - @entity262 - @entity6 cooperation on missile defense , intelligence sharing , military exercises , and missile defense collaboration in response to the @entity2 threat			1
the allies are key to deterring the @entity18 and motivating @entity41 -- and to our longer - term position in the region beyond this @entity2 footnote in world history .			1

***writers*** : @entity2 's priority is being able to threaten @entity20 and allies with nuclear arms
it 's a circular game , they say . north *bullies* , steps back ; @entity20 threatens , then talks
***writers*** : talks wo n't change situation . we must assess dangers , intentions , @entity41 , allies
***writers*** : we need serious and sustained pressure by all parties , including @entity41
