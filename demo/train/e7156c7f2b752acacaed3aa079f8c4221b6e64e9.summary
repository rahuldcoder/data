the architects describe the end result as " a surprisingly natural , ' bark - like ' texture			0
" @entity36 , head of @entity38 's arboretum and project manager for the @entity15 , said , " as a trained arborist , i have had the privilege of being up in the tree canopy ; experiencing trees at height and birds and other wildlife from a completely different perspective			2
