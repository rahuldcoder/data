there 's never been a better time to visit @entity2			1
the specter of @entity6 - @entity5 military exercises , a potential nuclear test , assassinations of defectors in @entity5 , and general saber - rattling have n't prevented a record 4,000 tourists from arriving in @entity12 this year			2
there 's even a hopeful air among diplomats that the two @entity16 , as well as @entity17 and @entity18 , might find the right balance of words and gestures to smooth out their emotional grievances that fuel regular nationalist flare - ups			2
the scene at @entity27 airport already gives clues into how @entity2 society continues to defy economic gravity			1
pyongyong elites check in dozens of boxes of household goods ( from electronics to wine glasses ) for their own use or to resell			2
like upscale @entity39 ferrying in and out of @entity40 , the international , multilingual and urbane class may seem like precisely the ones to support regime change , but also profit the most from the status quo			2
if you 're willing to part with your mobile phone at @entity12 customs ( hint : you have no choice , but they 'll give it back to you on departure ) , you 'll clear the airport with an efficiency that puts @entity54 's @entity53 to shame			2
despite @entity56 battering the country at the start of our visit , we came during a week when student groups , worker units , and families from all parts of the country flocked to @entity12 for the @entity66 mass games , which take place in the 150,000 - capacity @entity69 stadium and feature up to 100,000 performers in the most spectacularly choreographed precision movements ever staged -- almost every single night			1
@entity2 are no longer afraid or suspicious to engage with foreigners			1
soldiers and students , bus drivers and guards , all smile and wave , snap pictures and shake hands			2
we encountered locals at the mass games , film studios , world 's deepest underground metro , art schools , and delicious restaurants			1
this is not a society voluntarily marching in lockstep			2
like @entity39 and @entity93 , they are told one story but increasingly encounter the other viewpoints through media and tourism			2
our appreciation of their beautiful cultural offerings reminds them that they are a rich civilization temporarily trapped in an anachronistic state			1
outside of @entity12 one witnesses the reality afflicting many of the country 's 20 million - plus citizens : poverty and malnutrition			2
most of those labeled defectors into @entity17 are actually economic migrants , and even in @entity12 one can tell which children come from poor villages by their ragged sandals and brownish hair , made lighter by long hours under the sun in the fields			2
one of @entity12 's crown jewels is the 150 - meter tall @entity122 tower , which celebrates the country 's ideal of self - reliance			2
plaques in the lobby commemorate the visits of dignitaries and earnest academics from @entity131 , @entity132 , @entity133 and dozens of other nations who devoted serious study to @entity2 's @entity122 ideology in the 1970s and 1980s			1
we all know what 's happened to them			0
@entity2 too feels on the cusp of a new phase			1
though it has n't accepted @entity18 apologies for @entity146 imperial atrocities , and its many monuments excoriate in stone @entity6 's @entity149 aggression in which 420,000 bombs were dropped on @entity12 alone ( greater than the number of residents in the city at the time ) , the concrete high - rises with intermittent water supply and belching buses are all reaching the end of their shelf - life			1
@entity163 support and fuel subsidies collapsed in the early 1990s , and food security has been tenuous ever since			0
most investment now comes from @entity17 , but much less so ideological support			1
nominally committed to the same @entity168 ethos , @entity17 has still become one of the world 's largest economies while @entity2 lacks a credit rating			1
it 's not likely that the young regime of @entity175 will actually collapse			0
though the @entity176 teaches us not to put much faith in the softer sons of iron - fisted rulers , @entity2 is a deeply @entity182 society and symbolically views itself as still run by @entity175 's late grandfather and national revolutionary @entity184 and father @entity185			1
@entity175 is something of a caretaker while the old clique continues with anti-japanese propaganda , nuclear brinksmanship , and threats against the @entity5			0
the country 's premier , @entity192 , has been increasingly visible as a decisive government official , but as with everything else in @entity2 , it is a carefully staged diversification of authority , not a transition towards democracy			1
as one wanders through lively street arcades full of roller - skaters and volleyball games , one has to hope that @entity182 communism can make enough space for capitalism such that the burden of isolation falls on the regime rather than society			0
more tourism , mobile phones , and industrial joint ventures all help			0
one of the most promising is the @entity17 funded special economic zone of @entity215 at the intersection of @entity217 and @entity17 , a warm water port that would serve all three countries			0
a decade from now , it could be @entity2 's @entity221			1
another is @entity223 , also on @entity17 's border			0
suddenly @entity2 is making flat - screen televisions and its own dvd players			1
while not wanting to buttress the @entity175 regime as @entity17 has , @entity5 fears being marginalized for influence in the @entity2 and is returning to the economic engagement of its 1990s " sunshine " policy , and is considering expanding investment in its own special economic zone at @entity235			1
but a rail line meant to connect @entity237 and @entity12 remains dormant			0
still , the @entity2 too fears becoming too dependent on @entity17 , and like @entity238 , is courting more foreign investment for those with a high appetite for risk			1
@entity2 does indeed have plenty to offer			1
its largely mountainous territory is rich in gold and magnesium			1
mining operations are picking up , with serious interest from @entity249 and other extractive giants			0
its mighty rivers could be key hydropower resource both to electrify the country and sell power to the @entity5			0
it also produces agricultural staples like rice , corn , soybeans and potatoes			0
and of course there could be much more tourism , including to scenic @entity263			0
@entity264 and to witness the centuries of well - preserved @entity5 traditions in @entity12			0
for example , @entity27 - based @entity269 has increased its tourist volume from 200 to 2,000 over the past decade , almost half of which are @entity6			0
the nation 's capital , the largest of its half - dozen large cities , feels like an @entity275			1
like @entity278 's capital , it has broad avenues with revolutionary monuments and fountains , but also a laid - back , leafy feel			0
@entity283 made trams still roll through the city ferrying workers and students between homes , offices , and schools			0
@entity2 are not automatons but citizens , loyal but misinformed , curious and educated			1
whether in schools , billiard halls , or karaoke bars ( some @entity12 girls have perfected @entity299 's " @entity300 " theme song ) , the people can be quite open about their concerns			0
some mothers would rather their kids practice the piano than spend hours training for the mass games ; some teachers want their kids to focus more on math. outside the capital , where information flow is more a one - way street , western powers and responsible neighbors have to provide the young @entity175 with opportunities to change the hostile rhetoric			0
after the @entity319 performed in @entity12 , the reciprocal visit was effectively killed by @entity320 , which rejected the @entity2 visas			1
but how about having the mind - blowing @entity66 youth performers take stage at halftime in the @entity326 ? surely @entity175 would n't call for @entity6 's destruction after that			0
indeed , @entity175 has an opportunity now his failed @entity331 counterparts missed : to lead the rehabilitation of his country and enjoy his remaining decades not as a pariah but a statesman , not feared by his people but admired by them			0
rather than being banned from most international travel he could enjoy basketball games in @entity339 as he did during high school in @entity341			1
whether or not the @entity343 with the @entity5 like @entity344 absorbing the @entity345 in the early 1990s , the current priority should be turning the country into a passageway between @entity17 and @entity5 rather than a buffer			0
there 's no guarantee that economic opening will lead to political reform ; indeed , @entity17 is if anything a more likely future model of governance for @entity2 than outright democratization or sudden reunification			1
all the more reason then to stop pretending that placing conditions on investment such as freezing the nuclear program will actually work			2
diplomacy with pre-requisites has a very poor track record with nuclearizing states			0
rather than wait for statues to be violently yanked down in city centers , the goal should be de facto economic integration without political humiliation			0
the heavily fortified @entity371 ( @entity371 ) , then , would quickly go from @entity373 flashpoint to nature park given its unique ecosystem and flora			0
the past 20 years of revolutions followed by slow , halting , and even reversed transitions from the @entity379 to the @entity345 teaches us to be guarded in our optimism about the pace of change in countries whose political and economic systems have been frozen in time			0
today @entity2 is like @entity387 , isolated and ideological			1
even with a surge of infrastructure investment and technology , a decade from now it could at best become like @entity391 , exporting industry and agriculture but still corrupt and destitute			2
but it would be an economic passageway with greater freedom and opportunity for its people , and have a greater stake in peace than war			0
so come to @entity2 , and come soon : the @entity402 takes place in september with documentaries and avant garde movies being screened from a dozen countries .			1

@entity2 offers a rich experience for travelers , says @entity410
visit the *reclusive* nation now as it *emerges* , tentatively , into the modern world
@entity417 civilization temporarily trapped in an anachronistic state , he observes
now nation is courting more foreign investment for those with high appetite for risk
