-- this weekend 's inaugural @entity1 is a step into the unknown for @entity4 , but @entity6 's title hopefuls @entity7 and @entity8 are looking forward to the challenge as the 2010 season heads into its final three races			1
@entity8 led the @entity13 team to a 1 - 2 in @entity14 two weeks ago , leaving him tied for second overall with @entity17 's @entity16 14 points behind @entity7			1
the @entity20 circuit in @entity21 was finally cleared by @entity4 officials last week , despite rules stating a new venue should be completed 90 days before a race is due to take place , and the drivers are keen to see a track that most have experienced only in simulators and video footage			1
" it looks like a nice layout in terms of the track , we are all optimistic to go there and have a good run and i am looking forward to it , " @entity7 told the @entity6 website			1
@entity8 added : " i am pretty excited about @entity21 : it 's a new race track , which means none of us have been there before			2
while i know the race will take place , i ca n't really say anything about the track itself until friday			2
" @entity1 gets green light from @entity49 the duo will be taking tips from @entity52 , a driver for @entity53 who carried out a test run in a @entity6 show event there in september			1
" the track 's got a good mix of corners and i think we 'll see a lot of overtaking in the first sector -- there are long straights into slow hairpins , " he told the @entity6 website			1
" the straight after turn one and two is really long , so we may see some good slipstreaming there , like in @entity71			0
from turn seven onwards , there 's a fast section of flowing corners all the way back to the start - finish line , so i think the @entity6 guys will be happy in sectors two and three			1
it 's an interesting layout and the location 's nice , overlooking the sea			0
" latest f1 championship standings the 3.5 - mile ( 5.6 - kilometer ) @entity84 was built on marshland on the @entity21 coast and is the work of @entity89 @entity88 , who has also designed @entity4 venues in @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 and @entity96 among others			1
it will be the center of a new urban development , sited in an area popular with tourists about five hours ' drive from the capital @entity104			0
@entity106 's @entity105 , who trails @entity7 by 28 points , is also looking forward to the race as he seeks to regain the world title he won in 2008			1
" i 've driven the @entity84 on the simulator , and my first impressions were extremely positive , " the @entity111 driver told the official @entity4 website			2
" on paper , the track should suit our car quite well -- the first sector is all about good end - of - straight speeds and strong performance under heavy braking , both key characteristics of our car			0
" and the middle sector is fast and flowing -- it 's the kind of place where you want a car with a good balance and good downforce			2
i think it 'll reward commitment , it actually feels like quite a nice driver 's track			0
" @entity8 wins in @entity14 as @entity7 extends lead his teammate @entity137 , who is fifth overall , has also been impressed with the circuit			1
" there appear to be a couple of very likely opportunities for overtaking , particularly at the end of the three main straights , but possibly also off - line in the twisty final sector , " the defending world champion said			0
" the track looks quite high - speed , and the walls are close , so i think it 'll be an interesting challenge			0
" seven - time world champion @entity153 believes the drivers will be able to adapt to the new track			0
" finally this year we are going to a circuit which is not only new for me but for all of the drivers			2
@entity21 will be a very interesting country to see and even if the track has only just been finished in time , i am confident that everything will be fine , " the @entity158 veteran said			0
" i am very much in favor of new races and i think it is a benefit for all of us in the sport			0
it should not be too complicated to learn the layout and we are used to adapting quickly to new circumstances			0
