-- @entity1 has a new logo , but you 're forgiven if you did n't notice			1
the video - rental service has quietly debuted new branding on recent trailers for " @entity7 " and its other original series			1
it replaces the white , shadowed letters and red backdrop of @entity1 's iconic logo with a cleaner look comprised of flat red letters against a white background			1
no big deal , right ? companies update their corporate logos all the time			0
but here 's the strange part : @entity1 acts as if the new logo does n't exist			1
the company did not respond to e-mails and phone messages from @entity0 seeking comment on the new look			0
they 've ignored requests from other media outlets , too			0
nor has @entity1 mentioned the new logo on its social media pages , its website or even its iconic red dvd envelopes , which continue to show the traditional branding			1
what gives ? corporations typically make a big fuss when they tinker with an established logo			0
witness @entity39 , which turned the rollout of its new logo in september into a monthlong event			0
" maybe @entity1 is afraid that loyal customers will be disgusted by the new design , like what happened with the @entity50 a few years back , so they 'd like to pass the baton from one logo to another slowly and quietly , " wrote @entity45 for @entity46			1
" or maybe @entity1 just is n't all that organized and has n't made a decision as to what it 's doing yet			1
" either way , early reviews of the new look were predictably mixed			0
" even blurry it 's so much better than the previous one , " said a post on @entity60 , a blog about corporate identity , under the headline , " shadowless is the @entity65			2
" " it has a cleaner look without the stroke and shadow , and the less generous letter - spacing makes it feel more like a cohesive unit			0
" but a commenter on @entity73 called the new logo a significant downgrade			0
" the previous logo is so evocative of cinema , and it still looks pretty sharp , " wrote the user , who goes by recklessfred			2
" i can see why they 'd want to move away from a logo that says ' this service is mostly for movies ' since they 're making a big push for original tv - style content , but this revision loses the cinema aspect without gaining anything to replace it			2
" @entity1 to @entity90 : @entity92 takeover would harm consumers @entity94 : can @entity1 keep competitors at bay ? @entity1 , @entity97 : what 's new in may			2
