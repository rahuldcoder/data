@entity0 , @entity1 i 've heard that the @entity5 report on @entity7 torture is 6,000 pages long			1
my story , though , takes place elsewhere : in @entity0 , away from the @entity7 program that the report covers			1
the 6,000 pages of the @entity5 report are just the start of what @entity16 have to accept happened in their @entity19 starts and ends in the silence of a tiny , freezing cold cell , alone			1
that 's when you hold yourself in a ball , and fight to ignore the confusion of what has just happened to you , and the fear of what might be coming next			1
or the fear that comes when you realize that no one is coming to help ; that the life , family and friends you knew are all far , far away			1
the next session , seemingly the 100th in a row			1
i think my first period of interrogation lasted three full months			1
two teams of interrogators running shifts , day and night			1
each session begins with shouting , to wake me up			1
then they hit me on the face and the back			1
i am so desperate for sleep , my head is swimming			1
there are photographs of faces stuck all around the walls of this room			2
they demand that i identify the individuals , but i can barely focus to see if i might know them			2
the shouting and the insults get louder , and then they nod to a man in the corner			2
he injects me twice in the arm with some unknown substance			2
it 's the last thing i know			2
this time the guards enter , making awful honking noises , like wild animals			2
i tried to refuse to eat the little food they bring me , in protest at all this			2
the interrogator laughs at me , but then turns angry ; he swears loudly , and pours an army meal pack over my head			2
they tell the man in the corner to start feeding me intravenously			2
he inserts the tube in two different places on my arm and makes it bleed			2
closing @entity0 : who 's left and what 's in the way the freezing cold cell			0
this time the guards push me on the floor and take turns trampling over my back			0
i tell the interrogators that i ca n't face not eating any more			1
they throw food on the floor of the room and tell me to eat like a pig			0
they wo n't let me go to the restroom			0
they watch as it gets more painful , and laugh as they get the translator to describe how they will rape me if i pee in my pants			0
they make me stand and salute the @entity16 flag			1
i 'm in a sort of cinema room , where i have to watch videos of other prisoners being abused			1
then they tell me that i have to dance for them , and run in circles whilst they pull on my chains			0
every time i try and refuse , they touch me in my most private areas			0
it has rained , and there are muddy puddles everywhere			0
i 'm shackled , so i ca n't really walk ; they deliberately drag me through the muddy puddles			0
now it 's the pornography room			1
there is one with a man and a donkey			0
i 'm stripped naked and have my beard shaved , in a gratuitous insult to my religion			0
i 'm shown pornographic pictures of women			0
i 'm told to make the noises of different animals , and when i refuse , they just hit me			0
it ends with them pouring cold water all over me			0
hours later in my cell , i am discovered , nearly frozen			0
the doctor tells them to bring me urgently to the clinic , where i am given a blanket and treatment			1
over the next hours , they observe me as i warm up			0
they are just waiting for the moment that they can sign off on my return to interrogation			0
four years ago , six @entity16 government security agencies sat together and reviewed my case			1
their conclusion ? that i was innocent of any crime and should be released			0
the dirty and sadistic methods i endured -- which were then taken directly to @entity162 -- achieved nothing , except to shame that @entity16 flag hanging in the prison corridor , which i was made to salute			1
one hundred and thirty - six prisoners are still being held at @entity0 , whilst the politicians squabble over how to black out the @entity5 report			0
@entity16 can not keep hiding from its past , and its present , like this			1
our stories , and our continued detention , can not be made to disappear .			0
