-- a large part of northern and central @entity2 is now at the mercy of intensified attacks by @entity5 , and the group seems to be embarking on a new phase of its campaign against the @entity2 state -- piling further pressure on the government of president @entity12			1
the last four days have seen devastating bomb attacks in @entity14 , in central @entity2 , as well as a suicide bombing in @entity16 - the largest city in the north			1
two more villages in the state of @entity20 , @entity5 's stronghold in the northeast , came under attack , with at least 30 civilians killed			1
there have also been two bomb attacks in the federal capital , @entity27 , in the last five weeks			2
what alarms analysts is the way @entity5 and its supporters are able to carry out multiple attacks on targets far apart , all within days of each other			1
@entity14 and @entity16 are more than 300 miles from @entity20			0
the double car - bomb attack against a market in @entity14 on tuesday , which killed 118 people , according to the @entity38 , is typical of its strategy beyond @entity20 : to strike soft targets in places where sectarian tensions are already high , with massive force			0
the use of two bombs some 30 minutes apart copied an @entity47 tactic			0
@entity48 , a long - time observer of @entity5 , says its aim is likely to stretch @entity2 's beleaguered security forces , possibly by combining with another @entity53 militant group : @entity54			1
" in 2012 , one of @entity5 's goals was to launch attacks in the @entity58 and southern @entity2 via the @entity54 networks - in order to spread @entity2 forces thin in @entity20 , " @entity48 told @entity0			1
" we may be seeing a similar tactic employed now			0
" @entity48 says @entity54 networks carried out more than 15 bombings in @entity14 , @entity65 and @entity27 between 2010 and 2012 , even though the attacks were attributed to @entity5			1
those networks , he believes , have now been reactivated			0
@entity48 , an analyst at the @entity67 in @entity68 , says @entity5 recruits who have trained in @entity20 - disaffected young @entity70 from across the @entity58 region - may be returning home to " carry out attacks against their enemies -- whether rival @entity75 or the government			1
" @entity77 , a former @entity79 ambassador to @entity2 and now a senior fellow at the @entity81 , agrees that @entity54 seems to be reappearing but adds that little is known about the group and its leadership			1
what is known is that @entity5 and @entity54 have plenty of money to recruit and finance operatives -- through bank robberies and kidnappings			1
@entity77 says @entity5 has become adept at bank robberies and stealing weapons from government armories			1
@entity48 believes @entity54 's connections to @entity94 ( @entity94 ) have helped fill its coffers			0
in 2012 it kidnapped a @entity98 engineer , @entity97			0
@entity94 also held four @entity98 hostages - who were freed in late 2013 - reportedly for a ransom payment of $ 27 million			0
a few weeks later @entity97 escaped , or perhaps was allowed to escape , provoking speculation that @entity54 had been in on the deal and shared the ransom money			0
last year , @entity48 says , @entity54 received part of a $ 3 million ransom paid to secure the release of a @entity98 family kidnapped by @entity5 in northern @entity108			1
the challenge for the @entity2 security forces grows by the day			2
according to locals quoted in the @entity2 media , @entity5 fighters were able to spend several hours unchallenged looting and killing in the village of @entity116 early wednesday			1
the village is only a few miles from the school where the girls were abducted in april , and supposedly in an area where there is a heightened military presence			0
one option to squeeze @entity5 would be better military coordination with neighboring states , where the group takes refuge and resupplies itself			2
on tuesday , president @entity12 announced plans to bolster a @entity130 - with a battalion each from @entity2 , @entity132 , @entity133 and @entity108			2
but @entity48 says that " thus far all initiatives of this sort have absolutely flunked			0
it 's supposed to exist already in the @entity137 but , because of language issues , mistrust and lack of funding , does n't really work			0
" there is also a larger question looming in a country that has had military rule for more than half its life as an independent state			0
@entity2 has had civilian rule since 1999 , but @entity48 says there is now a risk that " the still less than 20 - year old democracy experiment in @entity2 may be coming to an end , since there are increasing reports of military defections and mutinies			2
" " with the potential for instability ahead of the elections [ due in february next year ] , the military may step in in one way or another , " he adds			0
@entity77 says the surprise is that the military has n't moved before now , given the deteriorating situation			0
but he says it is a much smaller and weaker organization than 10 or 15 years ago ; the top brass has been thoroughly politicized and is close to the @entity167			0
the nightmare scenario , he says , is a mutiny by junior officers			0
but @entity77 cautions that the @entity2 military is little understood by outsiders , which incidentally makes foreign assistance to improve its performance more difficult to deliver			2
there is another larger danger for @entity2 stoked by the @entity5 campaign : a version of ethnic cleansing			1
thousands of @entity75 have already fled areas like @entity182 in @entity20 , and @entity77 says that sectarian divisions and violence have divided the city of @entity14 into predominantly @entity70 and @entity75 districts			1
after tuesday 's bombings , which were likely calculated to inflame religious tension , @entity75 youths began setting up roadblocks around their neighborhoods			2
the @entity16 attack was also in a @entity75 neighborhood			2
in another sign that sectarian tensions are spreading , some @entity75 groups have demanded that the next governor of @entity198 - the country 's commercial capital and the city least prone to religious conflict - be a @entity75			2
for now , @entity77 says , @entity5 has the wind in its sails , after a series of devastating attacks in recent months that have humiliated the government and military			1
the abduction of the schoolgirls has brought it international notoriety and attention			0
far from seizing the opportunity to outline demands for greater autonomy and resources for northern @entity2 , @entity5 seems set on two goals : the destruction of the @entity2 state and what it -- and it alone -- sees as creating @entity223 on @entity224 .			1

@entity5 seems intent on destroying @entity2
attacks have shown it can coordinate operations
@entity5 is also forcing thousands of @entity75 from *hotspot* areas
its *ultimate* *ambition* could now be creating its twisted version of @entity223 on @entity224 .
