editor 's note : the staff at @entity3 has recently been intrigued by the journalism of @entity5 , an independent media company and web site based in @entity7 , @entity8			1
@entity9 is @entity5 's broadband television network			1
the reports , which are produced solely by vice , reflect a very transparent approach to journalism , where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process			0
we believe this unique reporting approach is worthy of sharing with our @entity3 readers			0
@entity7 , @entity8 ( @entity9 ) -- recently , @entity9 headed to @entity20 , the capital of the @entity22 region in southern @entity23 , to shoot two documentaries about the @entity25 , the most powerful but least understood of the @entity23 crime cartels			1
one piece was about the peculiar world of the @entity25 's homegrown @entity20 pop stars , known as @entity30			2
the other , excerpted here , focused on the environmental emergency brought on by the @entity25 's manipulation of garbage disposal in the region			1
each proved to be a strange and infuriating experience			1
the daytime hours were spent visiting housing blocks where every family had reported at least one case of cancer because of illegal toxic waste dumps behind their homes			2
our evenings , however , were spent at town square celebrations sponsored by the @entity25 two blocks away and attended by the same families we had met earlier that day			0
the @entity25 , it was suddenly clear , was dumping toxic waste in people 's backyards and then hosting @entity55 pop concerts in their front yards			2
see the rest of @entity58 : @entity59 at @entity9 today , the @entity25 's @entity20 is @entity23 on steroids , and it 's the result of a marriage of convenience between two powerful @entity23 forces			1
@entity65 we met were , on the one hand , fed up with the garbage situation			0
on the other , very few had any interest in pointing fingers at the @entity25			0
the @entity72 family is a prime example			0
on one of the last days of our shoot , we spent an afternoon with sheep farmers @entity76 and @entity72 at their home in the @entity80 countryside			0
the @entity81 were forced to leave their home in the town of @entity84 ( a suburb of @entity20 ) because all of their sheep were mutating and dying due to the high levels of dioxin in the pastures where they grazed			0
despite @entity84 being the most well - documented case of the @entity25 's involvement in @entity22 's environmental crisis , after the cameras were packed away , @entity72 and @entity76 told us that the @entity25 had nothing to do with anything and that it would take someone like prime minister @entity99 to come fix the situation .			1

@entity9 finds documenting powerful @entity23 crime cartel " strange , infuriating "
@entity105 's control of garbage disposal has resulted in environmental crisis
mutated *animals* , high cancer rate among consequences of years of *pollution*
