-- hours after surviving the shelling of a mosque at his presidential palace that killed a @entity6 preacher and several guards , @entity9 president @entity8 on friday insisted he is in good health and blamed " gangsters " for the attack			1
the president sustained a slight injury to the head in the @entity19 attack and he is fine , a senior government official told @entity0			1
prime minister @entity21 , the parliament speaker , the deputy prime minister , and the @entity19 governor were among seven injured , government spokesman @entity20 said			0
it was not clear if that figure included @entity8			1
a @entity9 official who asked not to be named told @entity0 that @entity8 was in the mosque when two " projectiles " were fired during friday prayers			1
he confirmed the death of @entity31 and said four bodyguards also died			2
@entity9 's official news agency @entity35 , citing a source in @entity8 's office , said three guards and the sheikh were killed			1
in his televised speech friday night , the president said the attack occurred as talks were taking place between him and affiliates of @entity44 , the head of the @entity46 tribe whose break with @entity8 has been followed by spiraling violence			1
protesters upset over what they regard as political oppression and government corruption have poured into the impoverished country 's streets for months to demand that @entity8 step down			1
a deal to make that happen , brokered by the regional @entity57 , recently broke down			0
fears of all - out civil war in @entity9 have spiked since , as government forces and people alleged to be @entity63 tribesmen slugged it out in the capital			2
their weapons have included missiles , according to witnesses			0
eyewitnesses , residents and government officials say @entity63 tribesmen carried out friday 's attack on the presidential palace			1
but the spokesman for @entity44 denied it			0
" the @entity77 tribesmen were not behind these attacks on the presidential palace and if they were , they would not deny it , " according to @entity80			2
in his speech , the president said those behind friday 's attacks were not connected with the youth - led movement in @entity19 's @entity85			1
rather , he said that " gangsters " perpetrated the strike as part of their bid to overthrow his government and destroy @entity9 's economic achievements			1
" i salute the armed forces everywhere and the courageous security forces who are keen on combating the attacks by a criminal gang that is acting outside of the law and is not affiliated with the youth 's revolution present in @entity85 , " @entity8 said			1
@entity102 , the spokesman for the @entity103 , @entity9 's largest opposition coalition , said that " the attack on the palace was pre-planned by president @entity8 to make people forget about the attacks that he has committed over the last two weeks			1
" @entity102 said @entity8 's forces have " bombarded most of the @entity44 family properties after the palace attack " and have killed hundreds over the past two weeks			1
" he is the only one benefiting from the attack on the presidential palace , " @entity102 said			1
" he wants people to feel he is oppressed and is defending himself and not attacking others			0
" the @entity118 is monitoring what it describes as a " very fluid " situation in @entity9 , @entity117 spokesman @entity116 said friday			0
the @entity121 also released a statement condemning " in the strongest terms the senseless acts of violence today in @entity9			0
" " violence can not resolve the issues that confront @entity9 , and today 's events can not be a justification for a new round of fighting , " the @entity121 statement said			2
" we urge all sides to heed the wishes of the @entity9 people , whose aspirations include peace , reform , and prosperity			0
" @entity140 , foreign policy chief of the @entity141 , called for an " immediate cease - fire " by all sides			1
she said that she had activated a mechanism to expedite the departure of @entity147 citizens from the @entity149 nation , all while pleading for a resumption of serious talks to end the crisis			0
" i appeal to all sides to protect civilians , " @entity153 said			0
" i have urged president @entity8 repeatedly to listen to the demands of the @entity9 people and transfer power			1
the only answer to the current situation is an immediate and genuine commitment to a peaceful and orderly transition			2
" elsewhere friday , government security forces and gunmen protecting protesters fought street battles in @entity169			0
the security forces began shooting at protesters assembled in that city 's @entity172 , and gunmen supporting the demonstrators burned an armored vehicle belonging to security forces			2
@entity178 , a youth activist in @entity169 , said four anti-government protesters had been shot during friday prayers			2
fighting has rippled across @entity9 for months between supporters of @entity8 and anti-government forces who want him out of office			1
according to the independent @entity187 , tensions escalated may 23 when fighting erupted between military forces controlled by " @entity8 's son and nephews and fighters loyal to the pre-eminent sheikh of the powerful @entity77 confederation , @entity44			1
" " the personal animosity and competition between the sons of the @entity197 ( @entity44 and his nine brothers ) and the sons and nephews of @entity8 have been a consistent obstacle to negotiations over a peaceful transfer of power			1
now , this animus threatens to drag the country toward a full - scale civil war , " the group said			2
the fighting has focused on these groups but " it could easily escalate , drawing in other tribal factions " and the armed confrontation has already led to the deaths of more than 100 people , the @entity208 - based group said in a " conflict risk alert " last friday			2
while @entity8 has been unpopular among many inside his country , he has been a longtime ally of the @entity118 in the war against terror			1
the @entity118 has counted on his government to be a bulwark against militants , including @entity224 , but it believes he should transfer power in order to maintain stability in the country			2
@entity121 spokesman @entity229 said that @entity230 , the president 's homeland security adviser , just traveled to @entity232 and the @entity233 for meetings with government officials to " discuss options to address the deteriorating situation " in @entity9			1
" @entity230 said that the @entity118 would continue to coordinate closely with both governments on developments in @entity9 in an effort to help bring an end to the violence , " according to the @entity121			0
with the level of violence escalating , @entity116 -- the @entity117 spokesman -- called the situation " clearly concerning , " but did not go so far as to refer to the situation in @entity9 as a civil war			0
" we call on all sides to cease hostilities immediately and to pursue an orderly and peaceful process of transferring political power as called for in the @entity57 - brokered agreement , " the @entity121 said			1
the @entity254 on friday confirmed that @entity118 troops remain in @entity9 for now , but may leave " depending on the situation			0
" " we 're closely watching the violence in @entity9			0
we still have some @entity118 service members in country , and we 're taking the necessary precautions , " said @entity254 spokesman col. @entity258			0
@entity258 would not say specifically how many @entity118 troops are still in @entity9 , but other officials have told @entity0 there have been about 100 trainers and support personnel rotating in and out of the country , helping to train @entity9 's counterterrorism force			0
the @entity254 denies that those forces have been among troops that have fired on civilians			0
" we have no evidence the counterterrorism forces we 've trained are being used against protesters			0
we have seen reports they 've engaged with armed forces , and we are looking for more information on that aspect , " @entity258 said			0
@entity280 , research fellow with the @entity281 , told @entity0 the fighting in @entity9 could destabilize @entity232 by spurring a mass exodus to the neighboring country and emboldening @entity224 to plot attacks			0
he believes @entity232 , which has great influence in the country , is the only country that can help it avoid the specter of civil war			0
" @entity290 exerts a strong influence on both @entity8 and the tribes that have turned against him through the lavish patronage the monarchy provides @entity9 factions , " said @entity280			1
" if @entity8 is compelled to leave @entity9 , @entity232 is one of the few countries that could possibly offer him refuge			2
the @entity232 have sought to subordinate their role in the crisis under the auspices of the @entity57 , but must now take a firmer stance to prevent the complete breakdown of the @entity9 state , which would have regional repercussions , " he said			0
@entity0 's @entity305 , @entity306 and @entity307 contributed to this report			0
