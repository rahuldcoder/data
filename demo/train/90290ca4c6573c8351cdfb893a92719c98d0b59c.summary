-- the @entity1 on thursday voted to repeal the death penalty , setting the stage for @entity4 to join several states that have recently abolished capital punishment			1
in the last five years , @entity7 , @entity8 , @entity9 and @entity10 have repealed the death penalty			2
@entity13 voters will decide the issue in november			0
the bill now goes to the @entity16 , where it is also expected to pass			2
gov. @entity20 , a @entity21 , has vowed to sign the measure into law should it reach his desk , his office said			1
" for everyone , it 's a vote of conscience , " said @entity1 president @entity25 , a @entity21 who says he 's long supported a repeal			1
" we have a majority of legislators in @entity4 in favor of this so that the energies of our criminal justice system can be focused in a more appropriate manner			1
" in 2009 , state lawmakers in both houses tried to pass a similar bill , but were ultimately blocked by then - gov. @entity41 , a @entity42			1
capital punishment has existed in @entity4 since its colonial days			1
but the state was forced to review its death penalty laws beginning in 1972 when a @entity47 decision required greater consistency in its application			2
a moratorium was then imposed until a 1976 court decision upheld the constitutionality of capital punishment			1
since then , @entity4 juries have handed down 15 death sentences			1
of those , only one person has actually been executed , according to the @entity58 , a nonpartisan group that studies death penalty laws			0
@entity60 , a convicted serial killer , was put to death by lethal injection in 2005 after giving up his appeals			0
" it 's not a question of whether it 's morally wrong , it 's just that it is n't working , " said @entity64 , the group 's executive director			0
" i think when you hear of 15 to 20 years of uncertain appeals , that 's not closure and that 's not justice			2
it 's a slow , grinding process			0
" eleven people are currently on death row in @entity4 , including @entity79 and @entity79 , who both were sentenced for their roles in the 2007 murders of the @entity83 family in @entity84 , @entity4			2
the high - profile case drew national attention and sparked conversations about home security and capital punishment			1
in vetoing the measure to eliminate the death penalty in 2009 , @entity41 cited the @entity84 deaths			0
dr. @entity79 , the sole survivor in that attack , has remained a staunch critic of repeal efforts			0
" we believe in the death penalty because we believe it is really the only true , just punishment for certain heinous and depraved murders , " @entity83 told @entity0 affiliate @entity98			0
advocates of the existing law say capital punishment can act as a criminal deterrent and provides justice for victims			1
opponents say capital punishment is often applied inconsistently , can be discriminatory and has not proven to be an effective deterrent			1
they also point to instances in which wrongful convictions have been overturned with new investigative methods , including forensic testing			0
" mistakes can be made and you may not know about it until science later exposes them , " said @entity64			0
but a recent @entity123 poll found that 62 % of @entity4 residents think abolishing the death penalty is " a bad idea			2
" " no doubt the gruesome @entity84 murders still affect public opinion regarding convicts on death row , " said @entity128 poll director @entity127			0
that number jumps to 66 % among @entity4 men , and drops to 58 % among the state 's women , according to the poll			1
the @entity1 's proposed law is prospective in nature , meaning that it would not apply to those already sentenced to death			0
