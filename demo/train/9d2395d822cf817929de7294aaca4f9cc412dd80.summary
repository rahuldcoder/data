-- after being humbled by @entity2 in the @entity3 and drawing against @entity4 in the @entity5 , @entity1 could hardly afford to drop points against @entity7 on saturday			1
the @entity8 did n't -- barely			2
and it was the man who has been dubbed ' mr. @entity1 , ' the returning @entity12 , who struck deep in injury time following a free kick from another @entity1 veteran , @entity15			1
both were re-introduced to the starting lineup by manager @entity18 against a stubborn @entity7 side chasing a @entity21 spot and the 1 - 0 victory temporarily increased @entity1 's lead atop the table to four points over @entity26			1
the @entity27 , however , once again cut the deficit to one point by later easing past @entity30 4 - 1 and @entity2 stayed within three points of @entity1 -- with a game in hand -- courtesy of a 1 - 0 win over @entity36			1
@entity1 it was n't , but the result was all that mattered to @entity1 skipper @entity12			1
" we made it difficult but they are a very good side and are playing well under ( @entity7 manager @entity44 ) @entity45 , " @entity12 , sidelined the previous three games with a muscle injury , told @entity39			1
" it was a tough game today			2
we 're delighted with the win and three points			2
" @entity45 was n't delighted , though			2
he felt the free kick -- given when @entity1 midfielder @entity52 went down -- should n't have been given by referee @entity53			1
" it was one of those situations where players were trying to buy too many free kicks , " @entity45 told @entity39			2
" you need a strong referee			0
the second half is a very , very tough game for referee			0
" you can see they are trying to get a dead ball situation because they could n't get any joy from open play			0
you can see the reaction and way he loses his footing , it 's not because of contact			0
he is looking for the free kick			0
" for more than 90 minutes , @entity7 indeed kept @entity1 at bay			1
@entity7 had the better of play in the first half , with @entity77 saving from @entity78 and @entity79 scuffing his shot when in a good position at the edge of the box			1
@entity1 could only go one way -- up -- and keeper @entity85 foiled @entity15 , @entity86 and @entity87 before @entity12 's winner			1
" great ball from lamps , " said @entity12			0
" i just managed to get a touch on it and i think it came off @entity85 in the end as well			0
" @entity26 , @entity2 respond @entity26 and @entity2 , coming off demoralizing 2 - 0 home defeats to @entity96 and @entity97 in the @entity98 , respectively , earned three points in contrasting fashion			1
@entity101 , benched against @entity96 in favor of the inexperienced @entity103 , started and scored twice for @entity26			2
@entity104 , though , left record signing @entity105 out of the squad after he missed a penalty against @entity96 and was criticized on the pitch by teammate @entity110 on wednesday for not doing enough defensively			0
@entity2 toiled against @entity36 at home , getting the lone goal from midfielder @entity113 in the 70th minute			1
" teams come here to defend and try to get a draw , " city manager @entity114 told the club website			2
" we can not win by three or four goals every match			0
" next up for @entity2 is @entity30 in the @entity123 final on march 2			1
@entity125 further eased its relegation worries by beating @entity127 3 - 1 for a fourth straight victory , @entity124 added to @entity130 's woes by thrashing the @entity132 side 4 - 0 in @entity132 and @entity133 earned a point in his managerial debut for last - place @entity137 , with the @entity138 tying @entity4 1 - 1			1
@entity139 , who signed a lucrative contract extension with @entity141 on friday , celebrated with a goal in @entity141 's 2 - 0 win at @entity144			1
" he 's a really important player , " @entity141 manager @entity145 told @entity146			0
" you think about the amount of clubs who wanted to sign him			0
@entity139 is one of the top players , he shows it week in , week out			0
" we never had any intention of letting him go			0
@entity139 has been great since day one			0
" yet @entity141 still trails @entity158 by eight points in the race for the final @entity98 spot			0
@entity158 hosts @entity162 on sunday while @entity166 , in fifth and three points behind the @entity165 , visits @entity167 .			0

@entity1 *rebounds* after a loss in the @entity3 and draw in the league
