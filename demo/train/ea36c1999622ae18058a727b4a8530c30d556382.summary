@entity0 -- after years of struggling with depression , @entity2 killed herself with a prescription drug overdose when she was 27			2
she did n't leave a suicide note , but she did leave her 8 - year - old son , @entity6			2
@entity6 's grandparents , @entity8 and @entity9 , immediately took over custody , because @entity6 's father lived abroad and had never been a part of his life			1
it was n't an easy transition , though			2
" it was a very difficult time for my parents because they were n't able to grieve , " said @entity2 's sister , @entity16			1
" they were immediately responsible for raising an 8 - year - old who also was grieving in his own way			1
and it was different than the way my parents were grieving			2
it was a pretty tough time for our family			2
" it 's often the grandparents who step up when a parent dies or is unable to take care of a child for other reasons , such as incarceration , abuse or mental illness			1
in 2011 , there were at least 2.7 million grandparents raising a grandchild in the @entity40 , according to the @entity42 's @entity41			1
but the sudden shift in responsibility can be incredibly stressful			1
grandparents may be living on fixed incomes , and the additional dependents can cause costs to soar			1
there 's also an emotional adjustment when an empty nest is no longer empty			1
" when that call comes ... your whole life changes , " @entity52 said			2
" it 's turned inside out and upside down			1
" @entity58 said she watched her parents , then in their mid- 50s , struggle with their new responsibilities			0
it affected their marriage and their health			0
also , like many children who lose a parent , @entity6 had emotional issues that followed him into his teenage years			1
" @entity6 was a difficult teenager , " said @entity68 , a 58 - year - old social worker			0
" the trauma and grief and loss of a parent abandoning you , so to speak ... it 's a huge , huge loss			1
" around the same time , @entity9 started noticing more of her work clients -- children and grandparents -- dealing with similar challenges			1
" the most common thread was that they all felt alone and isolated , " she said			0
" they did n't know anyone in the same situation that they were in			0
" determined to bring some of these families together , @entity9 began holding a support group for about 10 of them			1
when attendance began to skyrocket , she started her own nonprofit , @entity92 as parents , to help more people cope with the process			0
today , more than a quarter - century later , there are 20 support groups across @entity0 , and the nonprofit works with more than 3,000 families a year , providing them with financial assistance , legal advice and emotional support			1
more than 90 % of the caregivers are grandparents , but the nonprofit also assists aunts , uncles , siblings and close friends who have stepped up to care for children when their biological parents ca n't			1
" we are a one - stop shop for relative caregivers , " @entity68 said			0
" so many times , the families are completely overwhelmed			0
the kids come to them with a dirty diaper and a t - shirt that 's way too big for them			1
" do you know a hero ? nominations are open for 2013 @entity125 when someone calls for help , @entity9 is usually the first person they talk to			1
she listens to their story and then helps them prioritize their needs so the situation is n't so overwhelming			1
" it 's sort of like a jigsaw puzzle , " she said			1
" you have to figure out how to put the pieces back together to build a whole , happy , healthy individual child			0
" @entity140 called seven years ago when her daughter dropped off three children ages 3 , 9 , and 10 months			0
@entity140 received immediate assistance -- food , toys and clothes -- and with the group 's help she later became legal guardian of the children			1
over the years , the group has also helped provide the children with psychological , educational and medical support			1
but perhaps most importantly , @entity140 said , they have become part of a larger family -- a group of caregivers and children who back each other			1
" you know you 're not the only one , " she said			0
more on @entity1 : grandparents get tech - savvy to keep in touch in addition to weekly support groups , there are monthly picnics for families and friends as well as opportunities for the families to attend events together , such as the theater , amusement parks and sporting events			2
the nonprofit gets its money through grants , private donations and corporate sponsors , but it also helps grandparents apply for government assistance			1
@entity68 said many grandparents do n't realize there are special programs that may be available to them			2
" we have seen countless families who have maxed out credit cards and used all of their savings before they even ask for help , " she said			0
even if they do know there is help out there , many do n't know how to navigate the system and may need help using online systems or filling out paperwork			0
so de @entity9 and her staff or volunteers will walk them through the process			0
@entity207 , 60 , got in touch with @entity9 to help her navigate the court system and get custody and benefits for her young granddaughter			0
six years ago , @entity207 ' daughter dropped the baby off at her house , promising to return when she got back on her feet ; she has n't come back			0
" @entity16 was able to walk me through everything that i needed , " @entity207 said			0
" i was able to get medical assistance for ( my granddaughter )			0
i was able to get clothing for her ... rent			0
they helped me get on my feet where i could help myself			0
" she credits the group with keeping her family together			2
" without me joining ( the group ) , i do n't know where we would be , " she said			2
" i 'm going to be honest with you			0
i do n't know if ( my granddaughter ) would be in a group home or a foster home or what			2
" more on @entity1 : caregiver lives rerouted , enriched by aging parents @entity58 said her group has kept thousands of children from entering the foster care system , and they 've also kept siblings from being separated			2
" we 've literally saved families , " she said			0
but the true heroes , she said , are the caregivers			0
" it 's really the grandparents and the relatives who are doing this that deserve the recognition for putting their own lives on hold , " she said			1
" i just was able to plant a seed with something that happened in my own family			0
... " from a family tragedy , something wonderful has happened			0
" want to get involved ? check out the grandparents as @entity261 website at @entity262 and see how to help .			2
