@entity0 -- the top @entity3 military officer is reassuring his @entity5 counterpart that the @entity3 military is not pressuring the @entity5 army to increase its operations against the @entity9 there , a senior @entity3 military official said			1
the message comes as the @entity3 has turned up independent evidence that ties the suspect in the attempted bombing in @entity16 's @entity15 to the insurgent group			1
it stands in sharp contrast to tough talk from @entity3 secretary of state @entity21 , who warned of " consequences " if the @entity15 plot is linked to elements in @entity5			1
adm. @entity25 , chairman of the @entity26 , called gen. @entity27 , chief of the @entity5 army , to discuss the matter sunday			1
@entity25 called to " reassure @entity27 we are not trying to pressure him as a result of this case , " a senior @entity3 military official said			1
" @entity25 did n't call to say , ' you got ta do more because this @entity34 was trained on your territory			0
' " gen. @entity36 , commander of @entity38 forces in @entity39 , met with @entity27 as well , and his spokesman denied @entity36 made any effort to pressure the @entity5 official			2
@entity43 publicly took a tougher line , saying on the @entity46 program " @entity47 " : " we 've made it very clear that if -- heaven forbid -- an attack like this that we can trace back to @entity5 were to have been successful , there would be very severe consequences			2
" the senior @entity3 military official was adamant in saying the @entity3 military is not trying to make the @entity5 accelerate their timetable to move against @entity9 strongholds in @entity57 , a border region long believed to be sheltering @entity58 and @entity9 militants			1
@entity27 has repeatedly said his troops would not expand their operations into @entity57 until they have finished operations in other areas			0
" we are very comfortable with the work they have been doing and where they are at the moment , " the senior official said			2
other senior military officials offer the same assessment			0
the military official said the current view has been reached even as intelligence increasingly indicates the @entity15 bombing plot suspect , @entity74 , had " strong links " to the @entity5 @entity9			1
" we believe right now the @entity5 are doing everything they can , " the @entity3 military official said			1
he declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the situation			0
the @entity3 now has independent intelligence to indicate @entity74 had ties to the @entity5 @entity9 , according to a @entity3 official			1
the official could not be identified because he is not authorized to speak publicly			0
the independent confirmation is important because it gives the @entity3 law enforcement and intelligence community a better understanding of @entity74 's activities without just following leads based on his interrogation			2
the official said the @entity3 is still trying to figure out " how deep " @entity74 's links are to the @entity5 @entity9 and " how high up " his connections go into the organization			1
but he emphasized that public statements by top @entity3 officials about @entity74 and the @entity5 @entity9 are " not just based on what @entity74 is saying			1
" he would not discuss additional details about the other intelligence streams of information			0
" people are looking into other streams of intelligence that point in a serious way to links to the [ @entity5 @entity9 ] , " the official said			1
president @entity107 's top counterterrorism adviser , @entity106 , said sunday , " it looks like he was working on behalf of the @entity110 , the @entity110 , that 's the @entity5 @entity9			1
this is a group that is closely allied with @entity58			0
" @entity3 attorney general @entity115 , speaking on @entity114 's " @entity113 " on sunday , went further , saying that the plot was directed by the @entity5 @entity9			1
" we know that they helped facilitate it ; we know that they helped direct it , " @entity115 said			0
" and i suspect that we are going to come up with evidence which shows that they helped to finance it			0
they were intimately involved in this plot			0
" the @entity3 official also said the @entity3 is trying to get a better understanding of the @entity110 's own source of financing			2
while acknowledging the risk posed by a single @entity9 operative , he also said there are indications the @entity110 lacks extensive financial resources and it 's not clear it could set up an extensive operation in the @entity3			2
if @entity3 intelligence can determine and isolate a target precisely tied to @entity74 , such as the training areas where he might have been sheltered , the most likely scenario is that the @entity3 government would call in drone strikes to ensure any lethal action is as precise as possible and potential civilian casualties are minimized , several officials have told @entity1			2
in other news from the region , the @entity3 ambassador to @entity39 says the relationship between the @entity3 and @entity39 is as strong as it 's ever been			0
at a @entity152 news conference monday , @entity150 acknowledged that there have been " ups and downs " in the relationship with @entity39 president @entity155			0
but @entity150 said he expected the two countries " to be able to work our way through difficulties and come back together and still find ourselves well - aligned " as a result of @entity155 's visit to @entity0 this week to meet with @entity107			0
also at the news conference , @entity36 said there will be increased violence in @entity39 " as our combined security forces expand into @entity9 - controlled areas " in the south .			0
