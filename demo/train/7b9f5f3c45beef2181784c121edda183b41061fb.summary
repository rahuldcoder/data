-- @entity1 picked up her passport , got in a taxi , and headed from her home in eastern @entity5 to the nearby island kingdom of @entity7 -- a 45 - minute drive that many @entity5 take to get away for the weekend			1
@entity1 says women face too many controls in @entity5			1
despite having a valid passport , @entity5 authorities at the border sent @entity14 home			1
that 's because in @entity5 , a woman needs permission from her male guardian before she can leave the country			2
@entity21 -- a vocal women 's rights activist in @entity5 -- knew before she left that she would be turned away at the border			1
her attempted trip was simply to make a point about the @entity5 guardianship system that she says " controls all aspects of women 's lives			1
" " either you treat us like mature citizens or let us leave the country ( permanently ) , " she told @entity0			0
she 's urging all @entity5 women who are tired of " being oppressed " to go " to any border and try to cross it without permission from their male relative			1
" she wants to end @entity5 's strict guardianship laws in which women must get permission from their husband , father , or closest male relative before doing the most mundane of tasks -- including working outside the home , going to school , maintaining a bank account , or leaving the country for a weekend getaway			1
@entity5 is conflicted when it comes to women 's rights			1
women are not allowed to vote or drive , but earlier this year @entity5 @entity56 appointed @entity57 as the kingdom 's first female deputy minister of education as part of a massive @entity62 reshuffling			1
many consider @entity56 to be a reformer and the move was hailed within @entity5 as a great step forward for women 's rights			2
but @entity14 sees it differently , claiming even a woman as powerful as @entity73 " is n't really in control of her life			0
" " if she wants to travel is not up to her , it 's up to her male guardian , " she said			0
@entity77 has criticized the @entity5 government for not living up to commitments it made to the @entity82 @entity81			0
@entity77 issued a report last year detailing the negative impact of the guardianship system on @entity5 women			1
it said @entity5 officials have asserted that such guardianship requirements do not exist			2
" the @entity5 government is saying one thing to the @entity81 in @entity92 but doing another thing inside the kingdom , " said @entity89 , @entity77 's @entity90 director			0
" it needs to stop requiring adult women to seek permission from men , not just pretend to stop it			0
" efforts to reach the @entity5 government for comment were unsuccessful			0
@entity77 issued a report last year detailing the negative impact of the guardianship system on @entity5 women			1
it said @entity5 officials have asserted that such guardianship requirements do not exist			2
last month , @entity14 tried three times to cross from @entity5 into @entity7 on her own and without permission from a male guardian			2
she was turned back each time but she said she 'll continue going to @entity5 's land borders and its airports in an attempt to gain " her rights			2
" she has even protested on the side of a major road , the @entity118 that connects @entity5 to @entity7			0
@entity21 insists this campaign is different from previous ones she 's been involved in			0
" it 's not about just sending messages and petitions anymore , " she said			0
" we 're not going to send any letters to anyone			0
@entity5 women have to find someone who will take them to an airport or a border and say that they do n't approve of the system and that they want to leave			1
" she said that her mission is more than just an act of civil disobedience			0
" most of the people think i 'm doing it just to allow women to travel without permission , " says @entity21			2
" but i keep telling women that it 's the whole system that needs to be changed			0
