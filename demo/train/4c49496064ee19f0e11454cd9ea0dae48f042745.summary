he cuts it , snorts it			0
i ease back on the couch and consider the @entity37 i 've just crossed			0
" there is a moment of regret , followed by vast sadness			0
then comes a tidal wave of euphoria that sweeps away every negative thought in my head			0
i 've never felt so alive , so hopeful -- and i 've never felt such energy , " @entity1 recounted in an excerpt of his book that has been serialized by @entity49 newspaper @entity48			1

the tennis great revealed how he lied in a bid to retain his reputation : " my name , my career , everything is now on the line			1
whatever i 've achieved , whatever i 've worked for , might soon mean nothing			0
days later i sit in a hard - backed chair , a legal pad in my lap , and write a letter to the @entity55			2
" it 's filled with lies interwoven with bits of truth			0
i say @entity28 , whom i 've since fired , is a known drug user , and that he often spikes his sodas with meth - which is true			2
then i come to the central lie of the letter			0
" i say that recently i drank accidentally from one of @entity28 's spiked sodas , unwittingly ingesting his drugs			0
