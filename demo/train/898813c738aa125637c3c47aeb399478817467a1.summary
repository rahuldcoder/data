-- from the earliest days of aviation , pilots have relied upon paper maps to help find their way			1
even in an era of gps and advanced avionics , you still see pilots lugging around 20 pounds or more of charts			2
but those days are numbered , because maps are giving way to @entity13			2
the @entity14 is allowing charter company @entity15 to use @entity17 's tablet as an approved alternative to paper charts			1
the authorization follows three months of rigorous testing and evaluation of the @entity13 and @entity23 , a map app developed by aviation chartmaker @entity25			2
the latest decision applies only to @entity15 , but it has implications for all of aviation			0
by allowing the company 's pilots to use the @entity17 @entity13 as a primary source of information , the @entity14 is acknowledging the potential for consumer tablets to become avionics instruments			1
the @entity13 has been popular with pilots of all types since its introduction last year			1
but until now , it could not be used in place of traditional paper charts or @entity14 - approved devices such as more expensive , purpose - built electronic flight bags			1
the @entity13 was ok for reference , but not as a pilot 's sole source of information			1
the new @entity14 authorization changes all that			0
to receive @entity14 authorization , @entity25 and @entity15 went through a rigorous approval process			0
it included rapid - decompression testing from a simulated altitude of 51,000 feet and ensuring the tablet will not interfere with critical navigation or electronic equipment			0
@entity57 tested the @entity13 and @entity23 in 10 aircraft flown by 55 pilots during 250 flights			2
the first thought many pilots , not to mention passengers , may have is : what happens if the @entity13 or the app crashes ? @entity66 , @entity25 's product manager for the @entity23 app , says the @entity69 operating system and the app proved " extremely stable " during testing			1
in the " unlikely " event of a software crash , he says , it takes but a moment to get them running again			0
" the recovery time for an application crashing or the @entity80 crashing is extremely rapid , " @entity66 says			0
during the evaluation period with the @entity14 , the production app did not crash			0
but even if it did , @entity66 says it 's ready to go again " in 4 - 6 seconds from re-launch to previous state			0
" the @entity14 says each individual operator -- in this case @entity15 -- must develop specific procedures for dealing with system or software crashes and other issues			0
under the authorization , @entity15 will require a second approved electronic device , which most likely will be another @entity13 , in the cockpit			2
pilots may get magic fingers to keep them alert although this authorization applies to just one company , it is a milestone for all operators , including major airlines , because it opens the door for them to embrace the @entity13			1
though any company wishing to follow @entity57 's lead will have to endure equally rigorous scrutiny by the @entity14			1
@entity109 spokesman @entity108 says the process is no different from what is required for any other electronic device used to display navigation information			0
" as far as the @entity13 is concerned , we do that on a case - by - case basis when an airline applies to be able to use it , " @entity108 says			2
the @entity14 is already seeing more requests to use the @entity13 in the cockpit			1
@entity121 began testing the @entity13 back in november and there are about 100 pilots currently evaluating the device according to spokeswoman @entity125			2
she says in addition to the convenience , there is a practical weight - saving aspect to using the @entity13 as well , " it 's replaced about 25 pounds of manuals and charts			1
" @entity25 's director of portfolio management , @entity136 , says several carriers are looking into using the @entity13 and @entity138 , and with the @entity14 granting one approval , it should become increasingly easy for others to follow @entity57 's lead			1
" we 'll be able to reuse a lot of the documentation and the lessons learned working with executive @entity15 to help our commercial customers as they now begin to pursue @entity14 authorization , " he says			0
the charts available with @entity23 include charts for visual flight rules and for instrument flight rules , which are more commonly used by commercial operators			0
the app only shows an electronic version of the paper charts @entity25 has been producing for years , but @entity136 says future versions could incorporate the @entity13 's gps capability			1
he sees a day when tablets provide " door - to - door management " of a pilot 's information , from crew scheduling to weather information to navigation charts			0

the @entity14 has approved @entity13 instead of paper charts for a charter company 's pilots
ipads are popular among pilots but were only ok for reference
this allowance applies to only @entity180 for now
