editor 's note : @entity3 contributor @entity2 is a best - selling author whose new book , " @entity5 : a @entity6 , " will be published next month			1
@entity2 recalls a radio exec who was ahead of his time by working an almost endless day			1
( @entity3 ) -- i think perhaps the oddest person i have ever known was a man by the name of @entity13			2
but the truly odd thing is that we all seem to have turned into him			2
@entity13 was the vice president and general manager of @entity18 , the 50,000 - watt powerhouse in @entity19 , @entity20			2
he came to work every day at 2:30			1
that 's right : @entity13 would show up at his office at 2:30 a.m. each day			1
he would then work straight through until 5 p.m. he did n't do this once in a while ; he did it each and every day			1
he did n't do it to set an example for his employees			2
he did it because he could n't seem to stop working			2
" i 'm not one of those people who need sleep to be refreshed , " @entity13 told me once			2
" i 'll go to bed between 9 p.m. and 10 p.m. , and i 'll wake up at 1:30 a.m. i have an alarm clock , but i never set it			1
i shower and shave , and i 'm at the office by 2:30			1
" i asked him if this schedule made any sense at all			2
" it 's a good time to get a lot of work done , " he told me			1
" the phone is n't ringing , and there are no distractions			0
i have a pile of paperwork on my desk , and i go through it			0
" at 9 a.m. , he said -- after he had been at work for 6½ hours -- the other people at the office would show up			1
and he would keep going			0
@entity13 may have seemed eccentric -- he readily understood that perception ; he said to me : " i think what you 're thinking is that you 're talking to a nut " -- but if he had lived a little longer ( he died of cancer in 1992 at the age of 71 ) , he would have witnessed something that might have astonished even him : the rest of the world joined him in his obsession			0
@entity13 died just before the era in which everyone began using cell phones and staring at home computer screens			0
society might never have been ready to do what he did -- come to the office in the middle of the night and routinely work 14½ hour days -- had the technology revolution not come along			1
but come along it did -- and with it came the erasure of all the boundaries that at one time separated the workday from leisure time			1
e-mails and text messages and @entity83 and all their digital cousins may have given us the illusion of freedom -- we tell ourselves that we are unfettered by traditional offices , that we can go anywhere we please -- yet in the end they have created a nation of @entity92			0
we 're never off the clock ; that cell phone may ring at dinnertime , that allegedly urgent e-mail may arrive at 11 p.m. , that instant message from the regional manager may pop onto the screen when we 're on vacation with our families			0
and what do we do ? if your answer is , " we ignore them , " good for you			0
but the truth is , mostly we do n't ignore them -- mostly we snap to attention			0
ask yourself this : what do you think would happen to an employee who received an e-mail at home from his boss at 8 o'clock on a tuesday night , and who responded to the e-mail by writing back : " i 'm sorry , but i 'm only available for work - related e-mails during office hours			1
if you 'd like to communicate with me about this matter , please feel free to do so tomorrow after 9 a.m. " that might be the rational answer			1
but how many people -- especially in this economy , and in this job market -- do you think would dare to do that ? and it 's not just when we 're working for our bosses -- it 's when we 're purportedly doing things for ourselves			1
try to picture your father 's or grandfather 's reaction if in , say , 1958 , he had been trying to make an airplane reservation and he had been told by the airline : " we 'd like you to purchase a computer and set it up inside your house			0
you pay for it ; you also pay for the electricity to run it			0
now , we 'd like you to buy a printing machine -- you pay for that , and you pay for the ink inside it , and you pay for the paper that feeds into it			0
now , we 'd like you to use the computer you 've paid for to do the work of reservation agents , so we do n't have to hire as many of them			2
got it ? now , use that computer , make your own reservations , and print out your own ticket			0
" had your dad or granddad been told that , half a century ago , he might have thought he was having a nightmare			0
but we 're grateful for it ; we tell ourselves this is progress			0
if we log on at the moment the seat - selection process opens up , and we manage , by playing airline - roulette on our keyboard , to get ourselves an aisle seat , we feel triumphant			0
we barely stop to consider that we 're working for the very airline company to which we 're paying our money			0
@entity13 said he would feel funny not working all those hours -- he even did it on saturdays ; on the sixth workday of his week he would come in , as usual , at 2:30 a.m. " i just do n't think that most people have the commitment to their jobs that i do , " he told me			1
if only he had lived to see 2009			0
he would have been just a face in the crowd -- just another @entity175 to whom the notion of quitting time has lost all meaning			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			1

@entity2 : i once knew radio exec who started work at 2:30 a.m.
he says @entity175 now accept that they are always on call for work
@entity2 : in tough economy , workers are *reluctant* to draw boundaries
