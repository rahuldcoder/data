-- in @entity2 , the @entity1 have a reputation			1
they are notorious for prodigious drinking at @entity7 resorts , a complete inability to master other languages and the habit of recalling @entity11 every time @entity1 plays @entity12 at football -- or when it 's time to remind the @entity15 of their spineless defeatism			1
in turn , the words " perfidious @entity23 " have for centuries been part of a deep - seated @entity15 distrust of the @entity1			1
" the @entity1 lie at mid-point between men and beasts , " wrote the @entity15 author @entity24 in 1760			1
much more recently , @entity15 politicians have railed against " @entity30 " free - market capitalism as being responsible for the global financial meltdown			1
just two weeks ago , @entity15 president @entity33 complained that globalization and free trade were at the root of the @entity38 crisis			1
for their part , @entity39 are puzzled by the endless fascination of the @entity42 with the wars of the 20th century			1
" the older generation in particular see it as the last great act of national collective effort and self - assertion , the final episode in the history of the @entity52 before its imminent dissolution , " writes the philosopher @entity44			0
he 's not making it up			0
in 2010 , an astonishing 850 books about the @entity56 were published in @entity42			1
germans are relieved that the @entity15 do n't have such visceral memories of war but wish they 'd have more financial rectitude and a little less flamboyance			1
the @entity39 have fond memories of the deutsche mark , which rose out of the ashes with @entity12 and was sacrificed for the euro			2
chancellor @entity66 is conscious of a growing resentment among @entity39 that they must constantly open their wallets to support the more profligate @entity2			2
this strange triangular relationship is often played out in the councils of @entity2			1
but frequently @entity42 is the odd man out -- the semi-detached and half - hearted member of the @entity75			1
the @entity42 has always looked across the @entity76 as much as across the @entity77 to pursue its interests -- a sentiment only reinforced by memories of wartime @entity76 convoys that resupplied @entity42 and by the allied landings in @entity83			2
by contrast , visionaries like @entity85 of @entity15 and @entity86 of @entity12 , looking out at the ruins of @entity2 in the late 1940s , sought ways to bind together former enemies			1
the @entity91 had supposedly been the " war to end all wars			0
" but this time , when they said " never again , " they meant it			0
" make men work together			0
show them that beyond their differences and geographical boundaries there lies a common interest , " @entity85 said			0
last week , both @entity66 and @entity33 have summoned the ghosts of conflict to galvanize support for the @entity2 ideal , with @entity66 warning the continent faces its gravest hour since 1945			2
the ideal they are trying to save began modestly enough , with the formation of the @entity111 in 1952 : a single market for the coal and steel of six countries			0
but that common market was soon extended to become the @entity117 ( @entity117 ) , and gradually more aspects of national sovereignty were pooled			0
it was a @entity121 - @entity39 dream			0
@entity42 was too busy divesting itself of empire			2
and when it turned from colonies to @entity2 , it bumped up against @entity126 , who dominated @entity15 politics for much of the post-war period			1
@entity126 was innately suspicious of @entity42 and its " special relationship " with the @entity131			1
he twice vetoed @entity42 applications to join the evolving common market ; and pulled @entity15 out of @entity135 's military command			1
once @entity126 was gone , @entity42 -- under the leadership of the @entity138 conservative @entity137 -- was finally accepted into the @entity117			2
but @entity137 was in a minority among @entity42 's conservatives , who would spend the next generation arguing over @entity2			1
the centrists saw @entity2 as essential to @entity42 's trading and financial future in a world of titans			1
the " @entity151 " as they were often scornfully described , thought @entity2 elitist , given to endless bureaucracy and determined to undermine a millennium of @entity1 self - rule			2
and the @entity39 and the @entity15 were usually the villains			2
when @entity154 , a @entity15 who was president of the @entity155 , advanced the cause of deeper union , @entity153 famously told the @entity158 , " no , no , no. " the tabloid @entity160 newspaper joined in with one of its most famous splash headlines : " @entity164			2
" it was no surprise , then , that @entity42 opted out of joining a single @entity2 currency under @entity153 's successor , @entity167			1
the alternative was the implosion of the conservative party			0
the euro ( whose very name was squabbled over for months ) was another @entity121 - @entity39 enterprise , but its backers had different motives			0
for president @entity178 of @entity15 , it further bound @entity12 into a closer @entity75 just when @entity39 unification -- after the collapse of the @entity180 -- threatened to make @entity12 the dominant continental power			1
for @entity188 , then @entity39 chancellor , closer integration in defense , security and foreign policy was a prize worth the sacrifice of the deutsche mark ( though few @entity39 agreed with him			0
) which brings us full circle			0
the euro came into being in 1999 , but other targets ( inflation , public debt , deficits ) were at best patchily met			0
@entity2 had monetary union , but no fiscal union or convergence among national economies			2
@entity167 recently revisited the " folly " of the scheme in an op - ed for the @entity205			0
the " convergence of the powerful northern economies with southern @entity2 was unlikely , " he wrote			2
bad politics had taken precedence over sensible economics			0
the @entity42 , of course , usually have a sporting metaphor for these @entity2 crises			1
after @entity217 won an opt - out from the single currency and a " social chapter " aimed at establishing , for example , common labor standards , he declared , " game , set and match " for @entity42			0
the prominent @entity226 politician @entity225 said prime minister @entity229 " had played a blinder " ( a uniquely @entity30 compliment ) in @entity230 -- after @entity229 had refused to countenance a @entity2 financial services tax			0
the @entity160 took aim at @entity33 friday : " who do you think @entity75 are ? " screamed its headline			0
as one @entity2 official puts it , the @entity230 summit has given the @entity75 a vague road map and a not terribly accurate compass			0
just who is coming along for the ride is not entirely clear , but @entity2 's third largest economy ( or second if you use sources preferred by the @entity42 ) is clearly not			1
the words of @entity39 chancellor @entity86 , spoken in 1954 , are about to get one of those stress tests that banks are getting used to : " the unity of @entity2 was the dream of a few			1
it became the hope of many			0
today it has become a necessity for all of us			0

@entity42 , @entity12 and @entity15 have long had a strange triangular relationship
@entity42 has often been the odd man out , not fully *buying* into @entity2 unity
just who is coming along for the latest ride is not entirely clear
