-- they have titles like " @entity3 , " " @entity4 " and " casanegra			0
" they 're directed by auteurs with names like @entity9 and @entity10			0
they 've been selected from hundreds , sometimes thousands , of entries from countries like @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17			0
and some experts say they do n't have the slightest chance of winning the @entity20 for best picture			1
no foreign language films were nominated in the best picture category			1
the foreign language film category at the @entity20 is one of the most respected worldwide , @entity20 executive director @entity26 said			1
the category was launched in the late 1940s , when it became clear that @entity29 and @entity30 nations were creating incredible films			2
every year , each of more than 60 countries around the world selects one film to send to the @entity20 for consideration -- kind of like the @entity37 for filmmakers			1
the @entity20 is then awarded , not to the filmmakers , but to the winning country			2
" a better analogy is [ soccer 's ] @entity42 , " @entity26 said			0
" you only get to submit one team to the @entity42 and filmmakers have to decide within countries what they 're going to send			0
even @entity49 , which makes thousands of films a year , can only send one			2
" see list of @entity20 nominees -- including foreign language films @entity54 , a film critic for @entity55 , thinks the nomination process is peculiar and leads to some strange films being selected by certain governments			1
for example , " we 're not likely to see the best of @entity63 cinema because it tends to be critical of @entity63 government , " he said			0
a film must have predominantly @entity67 dialogue to be included in the foreign language film category			1
yet any film submitted is also eligible for other categories , as long as it has been shown in a @entity72 , @entity73 , theater for one week			2
the @entity75 film " z " won an @entity20 for film editing in 1969 ; it was also nominated for best picture , directing and writing			1
in 1972 the @entity82 film " @entity83 " was nominated for best picture , best actress , directing and writing			2
in 2000 , the best picture nominee " @entity86 " from @entity63 won for art direction , cinematography and best score			2
yet no foreign language film has ever won best picture			1
" i do understand why the @entity20 is looking first to @entity93 films , " @entity54 said			1
" it 's an @entity20 that 's centered around @entity95			2
" @entity26 equates it with any other country 's film awards -- if you watch the @entity99 you 'll see mostly @entity101 films win ; if you watch @entity75 's @entity102 , you 'll see mostly @entity75 films win			0
the @entity20 chose 10 nominees in the best picture category , up from five in past years			1
foreign film lovers had hoped it would open up the category to their favorite picks			0
" i 'm a great fan of many foreign filmmakers , " @entity26 said			0
" there have been years that , if they only counted my ballot , ... a foreign film would have won			1
" @entity114 has a good grasp on the foreign language film nominees for this year -- he 's already seen 47 of the 65 submitted			1
with a dvd collection including films from 105 countries , he 's watched the gamut of foreign films from artsy to action - packed			1
and his pick this year was n't the nominated @entity124 film , " @entity125			1
" it 's the @entity75 film " @entity127 , " by director @entity128 -- which also was nominated			0
" the ' @entity129 ' is way better than most of the movies in the @entity93 , " @entity114 said			0
" it 's definitely better than ' @entity132			0
' even a film that was good like ' the @entity135 ' -- that was a good film , i have no problem with that film -- ' @entity138 ' is still a better film			0
" @entity54 believes a film 's @entity20 win has less to do with its superior quality than with its commercial success			2
he says last year 's winner , " @entity147 , " which grossed more than $ 141 million at @entity93 theaters , might not have done as well if it was a foreign language film			1
" @entity147 " swept the @entity148 with eight @entity20 , including best picture , director and adapted screenplay			1
but would it have won best picture if it had n't been shot in @entity67 and released in the @entity93 ? " in a word , no , " @entity153 said			1
" there are lots of people who will only see a film in @entity67			2
i know very educated , very sophisticated people who just can not handle subtitles			0
" still , with @entity93 companies increasingly embracing the global economy , more @entity95 flicks are being filmed overseas			0
the lines are blurring between @entity93 and foreign -- @entity168 anime is popular in the @entity93 , as are @entity30 action films and @entity101 comedies			0
@entity26 says he can imagine a future when the lines wo n't exist at all			0
" i think it would be great to think of a day when there is no need for a foreign language category			1
i 'd love it , but i do n't think we 're quite there yet			0

no foreign language film has ever won the @entity20 for best picture
sixty - five nations submitted foreign language films for consideration this year
best picture nominees *expanded* from five to 10 , increasing chances for foreign films
film fan : " @entity147 " would n't have won last year if it had n't been in @entity67
