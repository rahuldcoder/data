where they used to boast about rocking @entity21 instead of @entity22 , now @entity23 has different footwear issues : " i do n't wear @entity26 , and i do n't wear sandals / the pump do n't work ' cause the vandals took the handles			0
" the @entity28 : @entity1 that 's the kick of " @entity30 " -- the @entity9 sound exactly like themselves , cutting loose without straining to fit anyone else 's idea of relevance			1
@entity23 , @entity36 and @entity35 " @entity34 originally scheduled " @entity30 " for release in 2009 , until the project was derailed by @entity23 's battle with cancer			2
now cheekily retitled " @entity6 , " it 's their first album in seven years , unless you count 2007 's stoner - funk instrumental throwaway , " @entity45			1

video : @entity1 ' @entity52 ' lead single " @entity52 " sets the tone with the group 's feistiest and funniest groove since " intergalactic " soundtracked the summer of 1998			1
( have you listened to " @entity58 " lately ? even nuttier than you remember			0
) the @entity9 ride vintage synths and cowbell , with @entity23 chanting , " we gon na party for the mother ( expletive ) right to fight !

the music is full of signature touches , from the punk drum solo in " @entity86 " to the low - end electro funk of " here 's a @entity89			2
" @entity23 sounds as gruff as ever in " @entity90 , " giving it up to hip - hop pioneers like @entity93 and @entity95 's " @entity94 , " @entity96 and @entity97 ( " @entity102 who you ca n't deny " ) , while both the bass line and the distortion - filter vocals echo @entity97 's 1980 classic " @entity101			1
" @entity1 were already old - school back when they were young - school , hyping an early - @entity107 hip - hop revival on " @entity108 " before the @entity107 were even over			1

instead , we get the sound of master musicians in their comfort zone , doing everything their own way			0
nobody would want to hear the @entity9 try anything else			0
