-- " abusive " @entity4 officials , like the one who ordered the stoning of a young man and woman in northern @entity9 , should n't have positions of authority after a peace deal , a @entity1 official said thursday			1
in considering negotiations between the @entity4 and coalition and @entity9 government officials to end the conflict there , authorities have been amenable to the idea of reconciliation with low - level @entity4 , but not all of them -- especially those who 've committed violent acts			1
the question remains of how much sacrifice should be made for the sake of peace			0
" the @entity9 government has said there will be negotiations with the @entity4			1
the @entity32 government supports that ultimately because we all know that that 's the only way to end the war , " @entity28 , the @entity29 advocacy director for @entity1 , said on @entity2 's " @entity30			1
" " when all is said and done , the question is , think about the stoning case up in @entity39			1
can we live with the deal in which the man who ordered the stoning becomes the mayor of that town ? " the question is not whether there will be negotiations , but what the terms of the final deal will be			2
will we be able to live with allowing these most abusive @entity4 commanders to get positions of authority in the country , and i think that 's what needs to be ruled out -- not just because it 's wrong but because i think a deal like that wo n't last , it wo n't be sustainable			1
we wo n't get peace from a deal like that			0
" the @entity4 stoned to death a man and a woman in northern @entity9 for allegedly having an affair , officials said monday , an execution president @entity70 called " unforgivable			1
" the stoning took place sunday in @entity73 , in the @entity4 - dominated village of @entity75 in @entity39			1
the pair was accused of having an illicit sexual relationship , a spokesman for the @entity39 governor said			0
the woman was about 20 years old and the man was about 27 , said @entity82 , district governor of @entity83 , which is also in @entity39			0
the woman was engaged , and the man was married to another woman			0
the two had been held by the @entity4 for about a week , @entity82 said			2
@entity28 there 's been " a lot more brazen behavior by the @entity4 in the parts of the country that they pretty much control , such as executions of people regarded , for example , as collaborators or against women who try to go to school			2
" this is the first time they 've actually publicly executed somebody in front of a crowd of people , " @entity28 said			0
" it tells me there are a lot of parts of @entity9 where the government is just absent			0
there 's no government there			0
there 's no @entity32 military there			0
there 's no formal justice system there , and so the @entity4 can fill the vacuum -- and when they do , this is what they do			2

reconciliation should n't *include* abusive @entity4 , @entity1 official says
two were stoned to death in @entity4 town
the stoning case *raises* questions about which @entity4 can be dealt with
