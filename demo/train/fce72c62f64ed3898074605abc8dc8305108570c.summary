-- last week , powerhouse wedding gown designer @entity1 announced that she and her husband of 23 years , @entity3 , were separating			1
" @entity1 and @entity3 have mutually and amicably agreed to separate			2
they remain devoted parents to their two daughters , " @entity4 , the president of the @entity5 , said in a statement to @entity0			0
the couple married in 1989 when @entity11 was a design director at @entity13 and @entity3 was a stockbroker at @entity15 before her tenure at @entity13 , @entity11 worked at @entity17 for more than 15 years			1
@entity11 , 63 , launched her label in 1990 , a year after her own wedding , with a prestigious @entity21 address on @entity23 's @entity22			2
she opened @entity24 , as it was called at the time , because she noticed something was missing from bridal gowns during her own wedding planning : art. @entity29 , an associate professor of fashion design at @entity31 , said @entity11 revolutionized the way people looked at the wedding gown ; she upped the sophistication and made the gown an expression of a state of mind , not just a marker of a special occasion			1
" she understands women who embrace fashion			0
in her case , she markets the wedding gown as a personification of love and beauty , not herself , " she said			0
however , @entity11 's recent announcement has caused speculation as to whether her fairy - tale aesthetic will be affected by her own not - so - happily - ever - after ending			1
@entity11 's empire has grown into a multitiered , multimillion - dollar effort , a marriage of ready - to - wear and sportswear , as well as bedding , eyewear , fragrance , stationery , luggage , footwear , tableware and flower collections			1
@entity65 , @entity66 and @entity67 are just a few of the influential people who have said " i do " donning @entity1			0
nowadays , designers sell a lifestyle , and with it , their clothes and accessories			0
@entity74 is renowned for her iconic wrap dress and signature prints for the ever - sassy career woman -- embodying the @entity74 label			0
@entity79 is synonymous with over-the - top prints and unabashed sexiness , fitting for her brand 's @entity83 jet - set look			0
for @entity11 , it was romanticism			0
" @entity1 is a magnificent designer who has created a unique aspirational world that alludes to sensuality and youthful sophistication			2
exquisite details , intricate draping and a nonchalant sense of style characterize the @entity1 aesthetic , " @entity29 said			0
does the end of @entity11 's marriage mean her enchanted empire is in danger ? @entity29 says not necessarily			1
@entity11 's @entity100 bridal collection departed from the typical matrimonial hues of white and ivory and included several black wedding dresses , while her spring 2013 bridal collection was emblazoned with scarlet - hued gowns			1
both are creative decisions @entity29 says could have been foretelling of @entity11 's own marital woes			1
" i think there is something there			0
this did n't occur overnight and ( is ) , in a way , a symbolic gesture			0
creative people do take their inspiration from everywhere , including their own personal life , " @entity29 said			2
however , fashion experts like @entity29 also say @entity11 's customers are looking for their own fantasy -- not trying to mimic the designer 's			1
" without doubt , every bride has her own fantasy about her own wedding			0
does this fantasy include the personal life of her dress designer ? i do n't think so , " @entity29 said			1
" it is about a dream and an image and not a projection of someone that is instrumental in setting the stage , " she said			0
@entity136 , who owns the retail marketing firm @entity137 , agrees @entity11 's personal life wo n't drive away sales because she never made it a part of the story			1
" the @entity1 brand does not sell her personal love story nor her marriage , but the soul of a @entity23 dedicated to offering women a luxury lifestyle brand , " said @entity136 , who is also a former director of marketing for @entity143 @entity23			2
" @entity1 sells a lifestyle beyond the wedding			2
the dream she sells is that of an ambitious , driven , determined woman destined for success			0
she is often photographed and interviewed alone without mention or sight of her husband , " she said			0
reports have indicated that @entity3 , a successful businessman , played a significant role in expanding the @entity1 brand , and neither party has commented on how their marital split might affect the company 's operations			1
but for customers devoted to @entity11 's designs , it does n't change the bottom line			1
@entity170 of @entity171 , will walk down the aisle on june 8 , 2013 , in a @entity11 gown			2
the 27 - year - old says she did n't , and still does n't , consider the designer 's personal life in her decision			1
" i saw myself comfortable in my own skin , in a well - fitted elegant dress on a very important day in my life , " @entity170 said			2
" the design spoke to me , not the artist 's marital status , but what she stands for			1
if anything , her dresses are probably going to get better since she will be back on the market and falling in love again			0
" and if there 's anything popular culture loves more than a fairy tale , it 's a second chance at love			2
