despite a shared passion for food , we come from very different backgrounds			2
to look at us , you might not think we have much in common ; one of us is a veteran @entity7 from @entity8 , the other a tattooed @entity9 with @entity11 roots			0
but together these different perspectives strengthen our shared work both as chefs and as advocates			0
that 's why last summer , when we were offered a chance to join the international relief and development organization @entity20 on a trip to @entity22 as part of its grow campaign , we jumped at the opportunity			1
@entity26 is @entity20 's global campaign to shift how our food is grown , sold and distributed by promoting smarter investment in sustainable agriculture models that will ensure everyone has enough to eat now and in the future			1
@entity20 invited us to @entity22 to meet some of the @entity22 farmers and chefs who are planting seeds of hope in a country that has faced more obstacles than any community should rightly be expected to overcome			1
@entity20 hoped we could learn about the inspiring work being done in @entity22 and share our own experience with sustainable food systems			1
you do n't often hear stories of hope from @entity22			1
in the rare moments when news from the country makes its way to the @entity50 , it 's almost always about crisis			0
the challenges @entity22 faces were obvious when we visited one of the largest remaining camps for people who are still -- five years later -- displaced as a result of earthquakes that devastated the country in 2010			2
extreme levels of poverty and hunger and a lack of economic opportunity are all ongoing and serious issues			0
but during our short visit , we saw a different @entity22			2
almost everywhere we went , we met problem - solvers who were innovative , creative and full of hope			0
they are working to build a stronger @entity22 that can prosper and thrive			1
@entity20 is working in @entity22 to empower farmers with tools and sustainable models of production that will help them build thriving farms and businesses that feed their communities			1
it also advocates for changes to policies that make it more difficult for @entity22 farmers to thrive			2
we saw the inspiration in the eyes of women farmers who were beginning to chart their own course for the first time , reaping the benefits from the @entity89 , a groundbreaking way to grow rice that improves the quality of harvests and yields more rice while using less water , fertilizer , and other expensive inputs			2
we felt the ingenuity of the lush urban gardens that seemed to have sprouted up from nowhere in places previously destroyed by the earthquake			0
we cooked jambalaya with produce bought from those gritty urban farmers , most of whom had lost spouses , siblings or parents in the earthquake			0
the gardens offer the prospect of a new way to earn a living -- growing fresh , healthy food for their community			0
we tasted the hope in the delicious meals we shared with young chefs who had just graduated from @entity22 's @entity120 -- their ambition and optimism the same as any chef you 'd meet in @entity9 or @entity8 or @entity126			1
we cooked for them and ate the local dishes they prepared			0
their food showcased a rich culinary tradition comparable to any food capital in the world			1
we danced and sang late into the night at the @entity135 until our ears rang and our throats were hoarse			0
the innovation , ingenuity and hope we saw can create the foundations of a @entity22 known for its food , culture and beauty rather than its poverty			1
this was the constant theme we heard throughout our trip			0
together , @entity22 people can lift themselves up and build a better future for their country			1
