@entity6 , a rising star for the @entity10 , was snatched from his family home in central @entity4 by gunmen wednesday night , a team spokeswoman said			1
the 24 - year - old emerged as the @entity10 ' top catcher this past season			1
he had a .267 batting average with 15 home runs and 52 runs batted in			0
this past year was his rookie season , and he was back in his home country playing for the @entity21 in @entity4 's winter league			1
the @entity10 could not confirm the kidnapping , but they published a statement citing @entity26 's spokeswoman @entity25			2
@entity6 was kidnapped by four armed men from his home in @entity29 , in @entity30 , @entity25 said on @entity31			1

the vehicle believed to have been used in the kidnapping was found in the town of @entity36 , about 60 miles from where @entity6 was kidnapped , the country 's justice and interior minister , @entity40			1
" the best investigators we have " are on the case , he said			0
the federal agency in charge of the case said they had assembled the police sketches of two of the alleged kidnappers			1
" @entity52 and an even head are important in this difficult moment that the @entity6 family is going through , " @entity21 president and general manager @entity50 said in a statement			2
" with @entity58 's help we will end up well in this complicated situation			0
" unlike most @entity62 countries , it is not soccer that rules in @entity4 , but baseball			2
a number of @entity4 players make it to the major leagues in the @entity69			0
but along with the success and paydays in the @entity69 , @entity4 natives and their families have faced threats at home			2
the targeting of baseball players by criminal groups is not unheard of in @entity4 , but @entity6 ' case could be the first time that a player himself was kidnapped			1

the @entity101 on thursday informed the government of @entity4 that it is prepared to assist in @entity6 ' case if asked to , an @entity101 spokesman said			1
so far the government of president @entity106 has not requested @entity69 assistance			0
currently the @entity101 is not involved because @entity6 is not a @entity69 citizen and the crime did not occur in the @entity69 , so @entity111 authorities have no jurisdiction to investigate the case unless asked			0
the @entity114 has warned of the increasing cases of kidnappings in @entity4			0
in 2009 , the number of reported kidnappings in the country doubled from the previous year , and police admit that many cases do n't get reported			0
