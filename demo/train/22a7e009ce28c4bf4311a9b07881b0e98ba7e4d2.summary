equally interesting is the rise of local currencies , such as the @entity71 and @entity72 pounds in the @entity73 , created to encourage trade and strengthen both local community and economy -- both operate largely via mobile			2
financial evolution and social mobility trading methods for goods and services are constantly evolving -- from gold to coins to paper to credit cards and now mobile - enabled transactions			1
