-- @entity1 and @entity2 are n't the only ones conferencing with lawyers			0
@entity5 , the network that introduced the bickering couple and their eight kids to the nation , has not only put the kibosh on " @entity1 " but also filed a breach of contract lawsuit friday against @entity12			1
@entity2 's life as a single mom was supposed to be the focus of @entity5 's new series " @entity1			1
" it 's doubtful anyone is surprised that @entity5 is cutting " @entity1 " from its programming			2
after 10 years of marriage , the couple announced their separation and divorce filing on a special one - hour episode of their reality show in june			0
a show insider told @entity0 on thursday there 's enough " @entity1 " footage to last until mid- to late november , but the program will be off the air after then			1
@entity5 would like to be able to replace " @entity1 " with the renamed series " @entity1 , " but the network will have to get past @entity12 first			1
the network announced in september that " given the recent changes in the family dynamics , it only makes sense for us to refresh and recalibrate the program to keep pace with the family , " said @entity5 president @entity42			0
in other words : less @entity1 and more @entity1			0
@entity5 's " deeper focus on @entity1 's role in the family and her journey as a single mother " apparently did n't go over well with @entity1			1
days after learning about the network 's new show , the father of eight barred @entity5 from continuing production on his @entity55 , @entity54 , property , citing concern for his children and effectively pulling the plug on his wife 's solo spotlight			0
" @entity1 " was expected to debut november 2 , but according to a complaint @entity5 filed friday in @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 , " @entity1 " is " suspended indefinitely			1
" in its lawsuit , @entity5 alleges @entity12 has violated his contract with paid and unpaid tv appearances he recently has made			1
the network claims it has lost more than $ 30,000 as a result of @entity12 's alleged disregard of his contractual obligations			2
in a statement provided to @entity0 , @entity73 , @entity12 's attorney , said that neither he nor his client have been served any documents ; @entity73 said he read the complaint on the @entity78			1
" apparently , @entity5 has elected to initially litigate this case in the court of public opinion ...			0
because neither @entity1 nor i have been served with legal pleadings or informed by @entity5 of the instant litigation , " @entity73 wrote in the statement , calling @entity5 's claims " weak , feeble and baseless			1
" " @entity86 and @entity5 has treated @entity12 like a dog by attempting to keep him on a leash and muzzle him and deny the father of eight the opportunity to earn a livelihood to support his family , " @entity73 wrote in the statement			0
@entity5 's complaint said both @entity94 agreed to a contract before the fourth season of " @entity1 " in april 2008 in which their per - episode compensation " substantially increased			1
" in addition , @entity12 agreed to provide " his and his family 's services in taping and promoting the program in and around the family home and to provide those services exclusively " to @entity5 , behave in an " appropriate " manner and not " promote or endorse any products or services , " according to the complaint			2
@entity1 has also " entered a lucrative agreement with ' @entity111 ' and its companion show , ' @entity113 ' to discuss his family and the problems he was having with mrs. @entity2 , " according to @entity5 's complaint			1
@entity5 also alleges that @entity1 has " sold photographic rights to numerous media outlets " and " has accepted payments to endorse products and services , " such as a pool party hosting gig in august at the @entity122 in @entity123 , @entity124			2
in his statement , attorney @entity73 said the contract will be " unenforceable " because the @entity94 entered into the agreement without legal representation			0
" in any event , " the statement added , " when @entity5 and @entity86 ended the program ' @entity1 ' they also effectively terminated the purported contract			2
" @entity73 said that @entity1 will " vigorously defend against the baseless action			0
" it 's unclear when either of the @entity94 will return to television after " @entity1 " becomes part of reality tv history			0
@entity1 , however , appears optimistic			0
the 32 - year - old told " @entity111 " this week that " he 's not worried about future employment " and plans to continue his television career .			0
