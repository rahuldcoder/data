-- she refuses to dwell on the past and accepts that she ca n't control the future			1
@entity4 juggles her career , family and love life , yet still is able find time for herself for @entity4 , it 's all about living in the moment			1
and with a thriving career , two children , and a handsome boyfriend -- @entity14 -- who can blame her ? on her divorce from @entity17 ... you have to keep it together for your kids and for yourself too			1
i 'm trying to learn from the things that have happened in my life , live more in the moment , and have more fun			1
someone told me recently to live in the present but make plans and take pictures			1
i 'm writing more , i 'm reading more			1
@entity14 and i went to @entity31 this year			1
on being confident ... as you get older , you know what you like and what you do n't like , and you 're not apologetic about it ... i used to judge myself so harshly			1
i think women in their 20s do			1
you 're hard on your body , you 're hard on yourself			1
but you start to realize that none of it is really all that important			2
as long as you 're comfortable , the best parts of yourself come through no matter what			2
your mother can tell you that a million times , but you do n't understand it until you live it ! on if she likes to cook ... i do			1
and @entity14 is a great cook , he does a lot			1
we spend the weekends outside @entity51 , in @entity52 , where i have a farmhouse			2
we have chickens and we grow cucumbers and tomatoes			1
it reminds me of where i grew up in @entity59			2
on working out ... i try to exercise every day			1
i like to run for about an hour , and i 'm big into working out with girlfriends			1
it 's an acquired skill , being able to discuss your love life , children and friends , all while you 're running ! but we have mastered it			2
on her new perfume ... i have a lot of favorite smells from growing up in the @entity72 that i wanted to capture in this scent			2
as a kid , i was always outside			2
there was a magnolia tree in the front yard that i think i spent most of first , second and third grade in			2
and there was the smell of honeysuckle from the creek that ran down by our house			2
@entity85 were important too , because every @entity87 or on my birthday my father would buy small bouquets or corsages for my mother and me			2
while we were working on the perfume , @entity92 asked me if i could explore other notes , but i kept going back to white flowers ! the packaging reminds me of my grandma 's bureau , where she 'd have little perfume bottles out			0
on her girlfriends ... there are three of us who wear pretty much the same size , so we 'll get together on a friday night and i 'll bring clothes i want to trade and they 'll bring theirs			0
we swap shoes and purses a lot			0
i wore my girlfriend 's dress to a wedding recently			0
on raising her kids , @entity118 and @entity119 , far from home ... sometimes it 's really difficult for me , being far away from home			1
@entity51 is where my job is and i have to be close , but i never imagined that my children would n't grow up next door to my brother 's children			1
or my mom and dad would n't constantly be around			0
you know , i had dinner every night with my grandparents as a kid , so i think missing out on that is a hard compromise			0
at least i have a lot of @entity72 friends in @entity51 i gravitate toward them			0
i think of those people as a part of my family : they take care of me and i take care of them			0
on being a mom and a career woman ... i love my life without work and i love my life with work			0
my mom , who 's a nurse , called me the other day when i was really stressed out from working a 15 - hour day			1
and she was like , " yeah , but think of it as a part - time job			0
" and i thought , that 's actually right , it puts it in perspective			0
i work incredibly hard for three months , but then i get a break			0
it 's about really enjoying my time off			0
where do i relax the most ? where are my children happiest ? my ideal scenario is to do one movie a year			0
but as an actor , i do n't think you can do an awful lot of planning			0
in fact , my new philosophy in life is i 'll cross that bridge when i come to it			0
i used to spend a lot of time thinking about the future , as if i could magically predict it if i planned it enough			0
and then i realized , i ca n't			0
