-- a marine expedition of environmentalists has confirmed the bad news it feared -- the " @entity4 " extends even further than previously known			1
organized by two non-profit groups -- the @entity5 and the @entity6 -- the expedition is sailing from the @entity8 to @entity9 through a " synthetic soup " of plastic in the @entity12 on a 72 - feet yacht called the @entity14 , provided by @entity15			1
the area is part of one of the ocean 's five tropical gyres -- regions where bodies of water converge , with currents delivering high concentrations of plastic debris			1
the @entity14 is visiting the previously unexplored western half of the @entity27 -- situated below the 35th parallel , and home to a massive expanse of plastic particles known as the " @entity4 " -- to look for plastic pollution and study its effect on marine life			1
leading the expedition is @entity36 , a former @entity38 marine and @entity40 student from @entity41			1
" we 've been finding lots of micro plastics , all the size of a grain of rice or a small marble , " @entity36 said via satellite phone			0
" we drag our nets and come up with a small handful , like confetti -- 10 , 20 , 30 fragments at a time			0
that 's how it 's been , every trawl we 've done for the last thousand miles			0
" @entity36 , who has sailed through all five gyres , said this confirmed for him " that the world 's oceans are ' plasticized			0
' everywhere you go in the ocean , you 're going to find this plastic waste			1
" growing glaciers smother climate debate besides documenting the existence of plastic pollution , the expedition intends to study how long it takes for communities of barnacles , crabs and molluscs to establish , whether the plastic can serve as a raft for species to cross continents , and the prevalence of chemical pollutants			1
on a second leg from @entity83 to @entity84 departing may 30 , the team expect to encounter material dislodged by the @entity9 tsunami			1
" we 'll be looking for debris that 's sub-surface : overturned boats , refrigerators , things that wind is not affecting , " @entity36 said			1
" we 'll get an idea of how much is out there , what 's going on and what it 's carrying with it , in terms of toxins			0
" @entity101 graduate @entity100 was chief scientist on a similar expedition to the @entity4 in 2009			2
according to her research , there has been a 100-fold increase in plastic garbage in the last 40 years , most of it broken down into tiny crumbs to form a concentrated soup			1
the particles are so small and profuse that they ca n't be dredged out			0
" you need a net with very fine mesh and then you 're catching baby fish , baby squid -- everything , " @entity100 says			0
" for every gram of plastic you 're taking out , you probably take out more or less the equivalent of sea life			1
" scientists are worried that the marine organisms that adapt to the plastic could displace existing species			1
@entity100 said this was a major concern , as organisms that grow on hard surfaces tend to monopolize already scarce food , to the detriment of other species			0
" things that can grow on the plastic are kind of weedy and low diversity -- a parallel of the things that grow on the sides of docks , " she says			2
" we do n't necessarily want an ocean stuffed with barnacles			2
" sea - level rise : impacts and mitigation measures around the world @entity36 says the mood on the @entity14 has been upbeat , with crew members playing a ukulele and doing yoga , " but the sobering reality is that we 're trawling through a synthetic soup			2
" also on board is @entity152 , founder of a company that makes eco-friendly baby and children 's products , including biodegradable beach toys made from corn , and @entity160 from packaging 2.0 , a packaging consultancy			2
@entity36 says they have been discussing the concept of " extended producer responsibility "			0
" as the manufacturer of any good in the world today , you really ca n't make your product without a plan for its entire use , because you could eventually have 7 billion customers buy your product , " he said			0
" if one little button has no plan , the world now has a mountain of buttons to deal with			0
there is no room for waste , as a concept or a place -- there 's just no place to put it anymore			0
that 's the reality we need to face			0
we 've got this plastic everywhere			2

a research expedition has found plastic in the last unexplored part of the ocean
the crew , which includes packaging experts , is studying the effects on marine life of plastic pollution
it will next *attempt* to measure the density and toxicity of @entity9 tsunami debris
plastic in the ocean has increased 100-fold in the last 40 years , scientists estimate
