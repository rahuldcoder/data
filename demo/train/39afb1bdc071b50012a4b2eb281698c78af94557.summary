today , april 20 , is " 420 : @entity0			1
" festivals and marches are planned around the world			0
the number 420 reflects the date , but it also represents the term 's clandestine origin in the 1970s , brought about by laws that still plague cannabis consumers today			1
in 1971 , a group of high school friends , the " @entity13 , " invented 420 as a code word for smoking pot. referring to 4:20 p.m. after school , the friends from @entity11 , @entity12 , would meet to smoke marijuana in their secret spot next to a wall -- the origin of their nickname			1
in the 40 years since , 420 has spread to become an international symbol for using marijuana , and it 's a part of the cannabis consumer 's vocabulary			1
threatened with jail and unemployment , people who use marijuana in most states must hide their activities			1
in 2011 , more than 750,000 people were arrested for marijuana possession and sales in the @entity35			1
in 2010 , 86 % of those charged for possession in @entity38 were black or @entity39			0
that , even though these groups represent about half the city 's population and use marijuana less than whites			2
but , slowly , support for cannabis regulation is growing			0
a recent @entity49 research poll found that 52 % of @entity35 support taxing and regulating marijuana , a historic high			1
it is n't that more people are using marijuana -- those rates have remained stable -- it 's that more people feel they can come out of the closet about their support for marijuana policy reform			1
websites like the @entity60 feature statements from celebrities and politicians in favor of marijuana policy reform , across the political spectrum , from @entity67 to @entity68			0
no longer a part of a fringe , those who see a better way to regulate marijuana are casting aside the secret codes and openly declaring support			2
the marijuana flag was waving proudly on @entity76 , when @entity77 and @entity78 became the first states where voters approved taxing and regulating marijuana for adult use			0
two recently introduced pieces of federal legislation would protect medical marijuana states from federal interference and end federal marijuana prohibition			0
as can be imagined , the april 20 celebrations across @entity77 and @entity78 , as well as other " marijuana friendly " states like @entity12 and @entity89 , will be joyful , well attended and burgeoning with cannabis products			1
it might even feel as if marijuana is already legal -- but it is n't , and , in some states , the need for secret codes is still very much alive			2
in @entity98 , manufacturing hash carries a mandatory two - year prison term but can also mean life in prison			0
under @entity104 law , a second pot possession conviction is classified as a felony offense , punishable by up to five years in prison			0
three - time offenders face up to 20 years in prison			2
and in @entity111 , possession of more than 20 grams of marijuana , as well as the cultivation of even a single plant , is a felony offense and punishable by up to five years in prison and a $ 5,000 fine			2
what this means , despite @entity77 and @entity78 , is that april 20 brings a chance to stop and reflect on the draconian marijuana laws still threatening so many @entity35			1
in addition to the lives harmed by arrests and incarceration , the economic costs of prohibition are enormous			0
the war on drugs has cost at least $ 1 trillion since it was announced in 1971 by president @entity126			0
the term 420 began as a secret code			1
but 40 years later , in some states the need for a code has given way to " cannabis pride " and open celebration			0
in other places , people will smoke or otherwise consume pot in private parties			2
and for those in prison and jails and for their loved ones , it will be just another sad day			0
make this april 20 , as the numbers of pro-legalization supporters swell , the day to join the @entity145 in promoting the legalization of marijuana for all adults and an end to the war on drugs .			1

this *saturday* , april 20 , is " 420 : @entity154 , " with festivals worldwide
@entity157 : in 1971 , high school friends invented 420 as code for smoking pot in secret
@entity157 : it 's disgraceful so many people are serving time on marijuana charges
she says 52 % of @entity35 want new policies ; 4/20 a good day to join legalization effort
