@entity0 and @entity2 artillery batteries exchanged hundreds of shells across their western sea border monday , a day after @entity5 warned it was preparing to test another nuclear device			1
about 100 of the 500 shells @entity5 fired into the @entity9 strayed across the line separating the two rivals ' territorial waters , the semiofficial @entity2 news agency @entity7 reported			1
@entity7 quoted the @entity13 as saying the @entity2 responded by firing about 300 shells into @entity5 waters and dispatching fighter jets to the boundary , known as the @entity18			1
@entity5 offshore firing appeared to have resumed after a lull , @entity7 reported , citing a resident of @entity22 , which is close to the @entity18			2
" some ( @entity5 ) artillery fire landed in ( the ) southern part of @entity18 but in the water , " a @entity2 @entity24 spokesman said			1
" we counter-fired over the @entity18			0
" when asked what @entity2 fired back at , the defense spokesman said , " we are not shooting at @entity5 , just shooting into the sea			1
" the @entity32 , @entity2 's leading ally , condemned the @entity5 shelling from the @entity35 and the @entity36			1
@entity38 is working " in close coordination " with @entity2 and @entity39 , @entity35 spokesman @entity37 said , calling on @entity5 " to refrain from actions that threaten regional peace and security			1
" and defense secretary @entity44 told reporters at the @entity36 , " the provocation that the @entity5 have , once again , engaged in is dangerous , and it needs to stop			1
" @entity47 , the @entity0 's main patron , also expressed concern			2
" the temperature is rising at present on the @entity55 , and this worries us , " @entity51 spokesman @entity50 told reporters in @entity53			0
" we hope that all sides can remain calm and exercise restraint			0
" warning fax the normally reclusive @entity0 took the unusual step of informing its neighbor of live - fire drills close in the heavily militarized western sea			1
@entity65 sent a fax early monday demanding that the @entity2 " control " its vessels in seven areas of the waterway near the @entity18			2
according to @entity72 , a vice spokesman for the @entity73 , the scheduled tests mark the first time -- in recent history , at least -- that the @entity76 has announced live - firing exercises above the maritime border			1
" we consider such announcement as a hostile threat and so have activated crisis management operation in case of ( military ) provocation , " he said			0
" we stress that we are fully prepared for all situations			0
" @entity88 , a leading @entity5 analyst , told @entity89 that the @entity0 may be " posturing " for attention in hopes bringing @entity38 back to talks over its nuclear program -- or moving while the @entity32 distracted by other global events			1
" they could be learning from @entity98 that while the @entity32 is distracted , the @entity5 can try to change the playing field and maybe slant it in their direction by pushing it back to talks while the @entity32 is focused on other issues , " @entity88 said			0
the two @entity5 never signed a peace agreement after the 1950 - 53 war that also pitted the @entity32 and @entity47 against each other			0
@entity88 called it a " clearly a good thing " that @entity65 notified the @entity2 of its military exercise			1
but if @entity18 gunners ended up killing someone across the border , " then we 're in a pretty bad situation			0
" " they are on a hair trigger , and because of the array of forces on the peninsula , you can get an action - reaction dynamic that escalates fairly quickly , " he said			0
" that 's something we want to avoid , of course			0
" nuclear tests @entity5 said sunday that it " would not rule out " a new nuclear test as it defended its recent mid-range missile launch that triggered international condemnation			0
" ( we ) would not rule out a new form of a nuclear test aimed at strengthening our nuclear deterrence , " @entity65 's @entity51 said in a statement carried by the state - run @entity130 news agency			0
" the @entity32 had better ponder over this and stop acting rashly			0
" the statement did not specify what @entity5 meant by a " new form " of test , and @entity72 said there are no immediate signs of nuclear tests being carried out by the @entity0			2
last week , @entity65 launched two medium - range ballistic missiles into the sea off its east coast , violating @entity148 resolutions that prohibit @entity65 from conducting such tests			0
the @entity150 condemned the move and is considering an " appropriate response , " said @entity154 ambassador @entity153 , the council 's current president			0
the military exercises are the latest provocation by the @entity0 and come after a maritime dispute last week was seemingly swiftly resolved			1
on thursday , a @entity5 fishing boat was seized after an alleged incursion into @entity2 waters and returned with its three crew members the following day			2
and while @entity5 often upsets its neighbors by firing various rockets and missiles into the waters surrounding the @entity55 , the country has at times engaged in more deadly military actions			2
a multinational 2010 report indicated that the sinking of the @entity2 navy warship @entity173 , which killed 46 sailors in the @entity9 , was the result of a a @entity5 torpedo			2
later that year , @entity5 artillery attacks on @entity178 in the @entity9 killed two @entity2 marines in what @entity7 called " the first direct artillery attack on @entity2 territory since the @entity183 ended in an armistice " in 1953			2
