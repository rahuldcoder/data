-- is it just harmless fun , or is something seriously wrong developing in sporting relations between @entity5 and @entity6 ? @entity7 , the last @entity6 tennis player to win the @entity8 back in 1983 , started it last year when he claimed that @entity5 's recent sporting success could only be due to doping			1
his remarks were quickly shot down by @entity13 , the @entity14 who has won the @entity16 grand slam six times -- a record he shares with @entity19 , and may hold alone this year			2
now @entity13 is at the center of another row , sparked by a comedy program on @entity6 channel @entity23 that spoofed the 25 - year - old and cycling champion @entity24 , who was this week stripped of his 2010 @entity28 title and banned after a long - running doping saga			1
the @entity5 government is so upset it has told its ambassador to @entity6 to send a written protest to @entity6 media , including the offending channel			1
and the @entity35 has responded by threatening a lawsuit			0
" the @entity37 will sue @entity38 for broadcasting a video which , besides inadmissible and slanderous insinuations , uses the federation 's logo			0
the @entity37 will also get support from other @entity5 sports federation mentioned in that video , so that there is a common judicial action , " it said in a statement			0
the @entity6 show , called " @entity51 " ( the @entity52 ) , features lifelike representations of @entity13 , @entity24 and @entity5 's @entity55 - winning football captain @entity54 among others			1
they are shown writing in books with syringes , and in one scene the muscular @entity13 puppet fills up its car 's petrol tank from its own bladder			1
" on this occasion , intolerable limits were crossed and the @entity37 can not tolerate the lack of respect and slander toward our athletes , " @entity5 @entity35 president @entity65 said			1
@entity13 , who has never failed a drug test , also expressed his displeasure in interviews with @entity5 media , calling it " a globalized campaign from the neighboring country			1
" " at the end of the day it is humor , " @entity13 said in quotes reported by national newspaper @entity80			0
" one day is okay but when , from what i understand , it is done repeatedly then that is not so good because it crosses the line a bit			0
and it is always with the same focus			0
" the institutions in general have to defend us because i do n't think it is a campaign against me or a campaign against anyone			0
it is a campaign against @entity5 in general , and against @entity5 sports			1
" i do n't think it is only @entity23 that does it			0
i think there are other media pushing it along and i think that is something punishable because in @entity5 sportspeople who are not clean are punished , they do n't compete			2
" @entity7 's comments were made in the wake of @entity5 's incredible sporting achievements in recent years			2
@entity13 was world no. 1 until last year , when he won his 10th grand slam title , having ended @entity115 's dominance before he too was usurped by @entity116			2
@entity24 has won the @entity28 three times , though he lost one of those titles after testing positive for a small amount of the banned steroid clenbuterol			0
he overturned his initial ban , but the @entity123 and the @entity124 successfully appealed to the @entity125			0
@entity54 has led @entity5 's all - conquering football team to the 2008 @entity128 title and the 2010 @entity55 crown , while his club @entity131 's big rivals @entity130 have been similarly dominant .			1
