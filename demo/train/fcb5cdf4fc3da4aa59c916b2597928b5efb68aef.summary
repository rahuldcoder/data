-- the human heart beats 60 to 100 times a minute , more than 86,000 times a day , 35 million times a year			1
a single beat pushes about 6 tablespoons of blood through the body			1
an organ that works that hard is bound to fail , says dr. @entity8 , a heart surgeon at the @entity10			1
heart failure is the leading cause of death in men and women , killing more than 600,000 @entity16 every year			1
for a lucky few , a heart transplant will add an average of 10 years to their lives			1
for others , technology that assists a failing heart -- called " bridge - to - transplant " devices -- will keep them alive as they wait for a donor heart			1
unfortunately , more often than not , the new heart does n't arrive in time			2
that 's why @entity8 and his mentor -- veteran heart surgeon @entity31 -- are working to develop a long - term , artificial replacement for the failing human heart			1
unlike existing short - term devices that emulate the beating organ , the new machine would propel blood through the body at a steady pace so that its recipients will have no heartbeat at all			1
the concept of a pulseless heart is difficult to fathom			2
@entity8 often compares it to the development of the airplane propeller			0
when people started to develop flying machines , he says , they first tried to emulate the way birds fly -- by flapping the wings aggressively			0
" it was n't until they decided , ' we ca n't do this the way @entity60 did , ' and came up with the rapidly spinning propeller that the @entity62 were able to fly , " @entity8 says			0
the idea of an artificial heart goes back decades			1
@entity31 began medical school in what he describes as " the @entity67			0
" " we were going to the moon ; we were going to achieve world peace , " and @entity31 wanted to develop the first artificial heart			1
in 1968 , he left for @entity72 as a flight surgeon			0
thirteen months later , his helicopter was shot down , and he nearly died			0
" that experience convinced me i should stick to something more meaningful for the rest of my life			0
the veteran surgeon , inventor and researcher has devoted the last half century to developing technologies to fix or replace the human heart , the most notable of which is the newest generation of continuous flow @entity87 , known as @entity89			2
modeled after an @entity90 , a machine that raises water to fill irrigation ditches , the continuous flow @entity87 is a pump that helps failing hearts push additional blood through the body with a rapidly spinning impeller			1
today , the continuous flow @entity87 has been implanted in 20,000 people worldwide , including former vice president @entity100 before he received a heart transplant nearly two years later			2
in some cases , the @entity87 's turbine has essentially taken over the pumping process entirely from the biological heart			2
in these instances , the implant recipient barely has any pulse at all			0
observing what happened in these patients led @entity31 to one compelling question : if the @entity87 can take over for a weakened heart , could it replace the organ entirely ? in 2004 , @entity31 asked @entity8 to collaborate on a new research project			2
@entity8 's interest in heart surgery dates back to when he was a young boy reading articles about world - renowned heart surgeons dr. @entity121 and dr. @entity122 , who developed and played a role in the transplant of the first artificial heart in a human in 1969			1
now the holder of some 70 - odd @entity16 patents , @entity8 says his work with @entity31 to build an artificial heart is the most ambitious project of his career			1
the surgeons set out to combine two @entity134 to replicate the functions of the heart 's right and left ventricles			2
using two commercially available @entity87 turbines , @entity31 and @entity8 combined the devices with plastics and other material used for implants : hernia mesh , @entity146 cardiovascular patches and medical silicone			0
everything met @entity150 standards , but @entity8 describes the final product as " rather kludged together			0
" the surgeons tested their invention by installing it in around 70 calves			0
all of the cows produced a flat line on an ekg , which measures heart electrical activity , yet they stood , ate and walked around , paying seemingly no notice to a small technicality : they had no heartbeat			2
in order for the @entity150 to approve the device for clinical trials , the calves needed to live for at least one month			2
@entity8 and @entity31 's device trumped these standards , with many calves living healthily for full 90 - day studies			2
@entity8 and @entity31 were encouraged , and in march 2011 , put their artificial heart into a human patient			1
@entity175 , 55 , was admitted to the @entity10 with amyloidosis , a rare autoimmune disease that fills internal organs with a viscous protein that causes rapid heart , kidney and liver failure			1
without some intervention , @entity175 would have been dead in days			0
@entity31 and @entity8 decided it was the right moment to test their device and the surgeons undertook the lengthy procedure			2
less than 48 hours later , @entity175 was sitting up , talking and using his laptop			0
when doctors put the stethoscope to @entity175 's heart , all they heard was a steady whir of what sounded like a boat propeller			2
@entity175 survived for six weeks until his failing kidneys and liver got the best of him and his family asked doctors to unplug the device			2
@entity175 's case proved what @entity31 and @entity8 had dreamed of for nearly half a century : humans can indeed survive without a pulse			0
but there are some potential downsides to having a heart that does n't beat			0
@entity210 , ceo of the first - ever @entity150 approved mechanical artificial heart , the @entity212 , says beating " up the blood in a blender " can activate internal bleeding in other organs			1
gastrointestinal bleeding and strokes are a high risk for patients on other heart assist devices , he says			0
@entity8 describes the @entity212 , which has been transplanted in nearly 1,300 people to date as a " brilliant and elegant device , " but the device is for short - term use only and is cumbersome			0
patients " have to carry around a compressor and have two air hoses going in and out of your chest			0
" @entity31 and @entity8 see a pulseless device as the only compromise to develop an artificial heart that is both efficient and long - term			1
two years ago , @entity234 , a 35 - year - old @entity235 biomedical engineer , made an @entity235 government funded trip to @entity238 , stumbling through the door of @entity8 's office at the @entity10			1
@entity234 was wearing blue jeans and a t - shirt and carrying a heart device he had been working on for the past 10 years in his backpack			1
@entity8 was skeptical at first : " a lot of people come to our door with devices and prototypes , and they range from moderately interesting to laughably stupid			0
... my expectations were very low			0
he pulls this thing out and starts telling me about it , and i quickly realized this is the most sophisticated and elegant device i 've ever seen			0
" made up of one moving part that rotates within a can - like exterior no bigger than a fist , the device has a large and small blade on opposing sides of the rotor			0
the small blade pushes blood through the heart 's right chamber , to the lungs , and the larger blade pumps out blood through the left chamber to the rest of the body			1
what fascinated the two surgeons most was that the device operates by being suspended in a powerful magnetic field , which prevents the wear and tear common in technology designed for pumping blood			1
two magnetic fields also control the blades ' oscillations , which each rotate an average of 2,000 times a minute depending on whether a person is standing , sitting up , exercising or coughing			1
stats show cpr often falls flat the excitement over the technology drew a $ 2.4 million donation from @entity238 furniture store owner , @entity290 , allowing @entity234 and a team of seven researchers from @entity235 , @entity293 , @entity294 and @entity295 to relocate to @entity238 in january to collaborate with the @entity10			1
@entity234 ' group also brought a 3 - d printer , which enables the medical staff to quickly make its own parts for the artificial heart			1
within days , the doctors can print a new part that pumps the blood and then can evaluate its performance , a process that once took months			1
in july , the doctors even tried a plastic @entity308 printed version on a calf			0
the calf survived for a number of days and was able to move around			0
they 're now working on a titanium version of the device as a prototype for a more durable technology			1
once that device is developed , they will begin animal testing , measuring the results to determine whether the technology is ready to propose implanting into terminally ill human patients			0
if all goes well , @entity8 , @entity31 and @entity234 would be able to submit the device for @entity150 approval within the next few years			0
@entity31 believes this artificial heart will save a lot of patients he loses today , particularly those who suffer from premature heart failure			1
" this is not something ready for prime - time yet , " he says , but for those suffering now " we hope to give them hope			0
" pacemaker pioneer now lives with device			0

scientists at the @entity10 are working to create a *permanent* artificial heart
the new heart device propels blood through the body , rather than pumps it
two magnetic fields control the blades ' oscillations , which rotate about 2,000 times a minute
