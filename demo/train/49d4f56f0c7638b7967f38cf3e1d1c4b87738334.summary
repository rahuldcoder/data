@entity3 , who only made the last eight at the expense of @entity21 after lots were drawn , fell further behind when defender @entity23 made a horrible hash of a clearance			2
to the dismay of his teammates and @entity3 supporters , he sliced it into the path of @entity31 , who added the second just before halftime			2
@entity11 , on loan at @entity36 @entity35 from @entity37 , sealed the victory with a stunning long range effort into the top corner on the hour mark			0
there was still time for @entity16 to complete a miserable evening for his team after recklessly hacking down @entity44 in stoppage time and earning a deserved red card			0
