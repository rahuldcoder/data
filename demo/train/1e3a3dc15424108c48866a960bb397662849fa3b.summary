-- a @entity2 circuit judge tuesday struck down a 31 - year - old state law that prevents gays and lesbians from adopting children , allowing a @entity8 man to adopt two half - brothers he and his partner have raised as foster children since 2004			1
@entity12 looks on as a judge overturns a ban preventing gays and lesbians from adopting children			1
" there is no question , the blanket exclusion of gay applicants defeats @entity2 's goal of providing dependent children a permanent family through adoption , " judge @entity18 wrote in her 53 - page ruling			1
" the best interests of children are not preserved by prohibiting homosexual adoption			2
" the state attorney general 's office has appealed the decision			1
@entity18 said there is no moral or scientific reason for banning gays and lesbians from adopting , despite the state 's arguments otherwise			1
the state argued that gays and lesbians have higher odds of suffering from depression , affective and anxiety disorders and substance abuse , and that their households are more unstable			2
@entity18 said the ban violated children 's right to permanency provided under the @entity2 statute and under the federal @entity52 of 1997			1
whether the ban violated the state 's equal protection clause by singling out gays and lesbians should be considered , she said			2
@entity18 's ruling paves the way for @entity12 to legally adopt the two half - brothers , ages 4 and 8 , whom he has cared for since december 2004 , the @entity57 said			1
the two boys , who are referred to as @entity64 and @entity65 in court documents , were removed from their homes on allegations of abandonment and neglect			0
" on that december evening , @entity64 and @entity65 left a world of chronic neglect , emotional impoverishment and deprivation to enter a new world , foreign to them , that was nurturing , safe , structured and stimulating , " @entity18 wrote			0
in 2006 , the children 's respective fathers ' rights were terminated , court documents said , and they remained in the care of @entity82 and his partner			0
" our family just got a lot more to be thankful for this @entity88 , " @entity82 said tuesday , according to the @entity57 , which represented him			0
@entity2 is the only state that specifically bans all " homosexual " people from adopting children , although it does allow them to be foster parents			1
this month , @entity92 voters approved a ballot measure to prohibit unmarried partners -- same - sex or opposite - sex couples -- from adopting children or from serving as foster parents			1
the measure is similar to one in @entity99 , which excludes same - sex couples indirectly through a statute barring all unmarried couples from adopting or taking in foster children			2
@entity104 allows single gays and lesbians to adopt , but prohibits same - sex couples from adopting			1
@entity108 , spokesman for the @entity109 , said the appeal was filed so a statewide resolution on the law could be determined by an appellate court			0
he noted that another @entity2 circuit judge declared the law unconstitutional this year but that ruling had not been appealed			1
" we need a statewide determination by the appellate courts , " he said			0
@entity82 's adoption petition can not be approved until the appeal process is finished , @entity108 said , but the children will remain in @entity82 's home			2
" these are wonderful foster parents , " @entity108 said			0
" it 's just that we have a statute , [ and ] the statute is very clear on the issue of adoption			0
" several organizations -- including the @entity130 , the @entity131 , the @entity132 and the @entity133 -- have said that having gay and lesbian parents does not negatively affect children			0
the @entity137 , a nonprofit organization that studies adoption and foster care , hailed the decision			0
" this ban , which was the only one of its kind in the country , has done nothing but undermine the prospects of boys and girls in the foster care system to get permanent , loving homes , " said @entity141 , the @entity137 's executive director , in a written statement			0
" so this decision by @entity154 is a very important , hopeful ruling for children who need families			0

new : ruling clears way for @entity8 man to adopt two half - brothers
new : @entity2 attorney general 's office said it intends to appeal
judge says @entity2 law banning gays from adopting children is unconstitutional
@entity2 is only state specifically banning all " homosexual " people from adopting
