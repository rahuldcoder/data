to investigate alleged comments from the front runner to become its next president that referred to @entity8 players as " banana eaters			1
" reports in @entity2 claim @entity11 , who is currently the organization 's vice-president , made the remarks at a conference of @entity2 's amateur leagues at the weekend			1
he touched on the debate that has followed @entity2 's group stage exit at the recent @entity18 in @entity19 , with some suggesting there are too many foreign players operating in the country 's top league -- @entity24 @entity11 made reference to the system in @entity27 , which has strict rules on players from outside the @entity30			1
" in @entity27 , they identify the players coming in and , if they are professional , they are allowed to play , " the 71 - year - old was reported to have said by @entity32			0
" here instead we get ' @entity35 ' ( a fictional player ) who previously ate bananas and then suddenly becomes a first team player with @entity40			0
" that 's how it is here			0
in @entity27 , you need to demonstrate what you have on your cv and your pedigree			0
" @entity11 's remarks prompted one of @entity2 's leading clubs @entity49 to say his bid to be @entity2 president was no longer " sustainable " while an online campaign set up by an @entity54 politician asked people to protest at his candidacy			1
world soccer 's governing body said on tuesday it wanted the @entity2 to investigate and stressed that tackling racism was one of its top priorities			2
@entity63 , executive director of the @entity64 ( @entity64 ) , said it was little wonder some of @entity2 's top clubs , and the country 's prime minister @entity68 , have come out against @entity11 's presidency bid			1
" it 's quite clear there is a strong public opinion focus on this guy and this idea he should not become president at any cost , " he told @entity0			0
" unfortunately , the people that will vote him in later in august do n't necessarily share that view			0
" to have someone who has said the sort of things that he 's said , said them in the way he 's said them , to become a president of one of the top five footballing countries in @entity90 really is going to be quite a big shock			0
" @entity11 has been president of the @entity54 amateur football federation for more than a decade and has apologized twice since he made the remarks			1
but he retains support from big clubs like @entity96 and is thought to be winning the battle with his rival for the presidency , former @entity2 midfielder @entity100			2
although his comments are not enough for @entity1 or its @entity90 counterpart @entity102 to block his bid , @entity63 thinks they may act if he is elected			0
" i imagine if he gets elected in two weeks ' time that @entity1 and @entity102 will start to lobby against him , " @entity63 added			0
" because how can he look people from @entity8 nations in eye , for example , within @entity1 who he has already insulted through these words ? " how can he possibly manage the national team when it has two or three black players but younger , emerging black players			1
" the former @entity2 president @entity114 had done a great deal to tackle racism , he was very strong and put in place some very innovative measures			2
" i think the question is , where does this leave this very strong struggle , this real big problem that @entity54 football has had historically ? " the @entity2 said they would not be commenting when contacted by @entity0 but @entity1 made its position clear with a statement on tuesday morning			1
it read : " media reports concerning alleged racist comments by one of the presidential candidates for the @entity54 @entity131 have alerted @entity1 's @entity132 against racism and discrimination and its chairman @entity135			1
" as such , @entity1 has written a letter to the @entity54 fa asking it to take the appropriate steps to investigate and decide on this matter and report to @entity1			1
" in the letter , @entity1 reminded the @entity54 @entity131 that the fight against racism is a top priority for @entity1			2
" in 2013 , the @entity143 unanimously passed a strong resolution on the fight against racism and discrimination , which , among other measures , reminded the member associations about their obligation to put every effort into eliminating racism and discrimination in football			0
" in its correspondence , @entity1 also stressed that officials of the football community are expected to act as role models in the fight against racism			2
