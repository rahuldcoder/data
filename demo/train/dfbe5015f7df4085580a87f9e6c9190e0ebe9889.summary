@entity1 , @entity0 -- what a difference a few city blocks can make			1
crowds of thousands upon thousands of @entity0 demonstrated peacefully friday , filling most of @entity1 's sprawling and once besieged @entity7			1
they played music on loud speakers , danced and chanted " down with the dictator " in a rally dubbed " day of departure			2
" but down the side streets leading east from @entity7 , just a few hundred meters away , fierce clashes raged between gangs of pro- and anti-regime youths			1
after hours of skirmishes , the rebels had advanced east , erecting barricades and checkpoints around the imposing 19th century stone buildings that line the roundabout in @entity24			2
by 7 p.m. , the opposition activists had also seized streets running several blocks deeper into the city from @entity29			1
several ambulances stood parked in @entity29 , their blue lights flashing as medics treated wounded men inside			0
a 20 - minute walk down the streets of newly captured opposition territory showed streets littered with rocks and paving stones , which have been the primary weapons used during three days of urban fighting			1
young men raced back from the clash points , carrying wounded comrades who howled in pain			2
they carried one young man dressed in a preppy button - down shirt and sweater into a makeshift first aid station in a storefront at one of the entrances to @entity7			0
" a group of 50 of them surrounded me and beat me , " the man yelled			0
he bit down furiously on a notebook and sweated profusely as medics took off his shoe , revealing what appeared to be a badly broken foot			0
moments later , bystanders applauded when the man waved a victory sign as he was carried away			0
an @entity0 army soldier stood in the corner of the room , keeping a close eye on a bruised and bloodied shoeless man who sat in a corner			1
he was a prisoner who appeared to have been severely beaten after being captured by demonstrators			2
when the soldier motioned for the man to follow him out of the first aid station , the captive cried and begged not to be led out into @entity7			0
throughout the day , several captives have been similarly escorted by @entity0 troops deployed in @entity7 to a military - controlled alley behind @entity1 's @entity76			1
the soldiers protected these prisoners from angry protesters , who cursed and tried to beat them as they were led through the square			1
at one point , activists sounded the alarm , calling for 10 volunteers to rush to the front lines past @entity24			0
young men began beating metal poles against metal barricades and whistling as teenagers wearing helmets made from cardboard boxes and carrying stones raced toward the latest street battle .			0
