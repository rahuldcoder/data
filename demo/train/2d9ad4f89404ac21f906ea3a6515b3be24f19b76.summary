@entity0 , @entity1 -- spc. @entity3 arrived at @entity4 , @entity1 , a week ago wednesday to prepare for an upcoming tour of @entity6			1
the following day , he , like all deploying soldiers , reported to the " ready room " on post to fill out final paperwork			1
however , what was to be another day of the mundane erupted into hell on @entity14			2
@entity3 heard shots , though that 's a sound to which soldiers grow accustomed			1
he had been hearing blanks for many months of training			2
but on november 5 at @entity4 , he quickly understood that something was terribly wrong when he saw the blood -- crimson everywhere			1
" seeing bullet wounds in the back of a friend 's head , seeing friends grabbing their arms , and blood just everywhere			2
it 's a pretty hard thing to see , " @entity3 recalled			1
" and not having any way to defend yourself			2
" the gunman had been in the room for a while and had perfectly blended in with his @entity37 combat uniform , his gold major rank emblazoned on his chest			2
no one had reason to pay him heed , @entity3 said			1
when the madness began , the gunman popped up like a target at a shooting range			2
he just stood up and started firing methodically and with precision			0
" he was very swift , very tactical , " said @entity3 , sitting in a wheelchair at the @entity48 near @entity4 , his left arm and hand bandaged			1
the mass shooting last week was the deadliest ever on a @entity54 military base			0
twelve soldiers and one civilian were killed ; more than 40 others were wounded			0
fifteen soldiers remained hospitalized on wednesday , four in intensive care , according to @entity4 spokesman col. @entity60			1
they were victims of a soldier who turned on his own , authorities say			2
@entity3 saw the laser sights on the gunman 's weapon			1
the shooter looked serious , intent			2
he screamed at the top of his lungs , " @entity70 , " which means ' @entity71 is great ' in @entity72			0
@entity3 dropped to the floor , hugging the ground for dear life			1
what insanity was this ? " once i saw the blood , i realized i had to move , " he said			0
" i had to get out of there			0
" @entity3 began to stand up and noticed the gunman was pointing in his direction			1
he picked up a folding table next to him -- it was the heaviest object he could see -- and hurled it toward the shooter			1
he knew it would draw the gunman 's attention and divert his line of sight from others			2
@entity3 said he was n't trying to play a hero			1
" there are guys overseas doing more than what i did , " he said			0
" i just happened to be at a certain place at a certain time in the world and hopefully i made a difference			0
" but that 's when he got hit			2
he took a round that pierced his hip on the left side and tore through his abdomen			0
" after the hit , i fell down , not even realizing i had been hit , " he said			0
" as i tried to get back up , i was shot in the elbow on the left arm and ... the knuckle on the left pinky finger			0
" he was like a wounded animal desperate to escape the hunter 's aim			2
" he wanted to kill all of us , " @entity3 said			1
" we were all unarmed			0
" @entity3 's gut felt like a knife slicing through it			1
he could n't feel his leg			0
his left arm was numb , too			0
he stared at it and thought of those dummy arms that people buy at @entity120			0
" @entity121 , " he thought			0
" this guy shot me			0
" @entity3 began moving with every ounce of strength he could muster and hid in a nearby cubicle			1
the gunman had started moving to the other side of the building , reloading and shooting			0
@entity3 knew he had to get out of that building			1
" as i started to run , i fell again , not realizing i could n't use my left leg			0
" after falling , @entity3 said , he " threw all of my body weight ... towards that door as hard and as fast as possible			1
" " once i hit that front door , i began to low crawl , about five meters up a hill just , you know , pushing my body forward with everything i had , " he said			0
a staff sergeant grabbed him by his uniform collar and dragged him into an office and locked the door			0
" everything is going to be all right , " the sergeant told him , as he began administering first aid			0
@entity3 said he does n't know the sergeant 's name , but he will recognize him instantly if their paths ever cross again			1
" our father who art in heaven ... hallowed be thy name			0
" @entity3 , a practicing @entity156 , lie on the ground , repeating the prayer over and over again			1
he did n't know whether he would see his wife again			0
a week later , @entity3 has undergone two operations and still has a bullet lodged in his right hip			1
on wednesday , he was making his way to the @entity37 's @entity164 in @entity165 , @entity1 , for further treatment			2
he knows that 's where maj. @entity168 , the accused shooter , is also being treated			1
" i ca n't really think about it , " @entity3 said			1
" i have a lot of faith in our military , our judicial system -- and @entity71			0
" soldiers are taught from day one that you help the wounded , even when they are enemies in combat , even the guy who shot you			2
" do n't get me wrong , " he said , " everything in your heart wants to [ unleash ] anger at this person , but we have to trust that our system works somehow			0
" by no means am i happy that he is in better shape than a lot of my comrades , " @entity3 said about the suspect			1
" but i 'm not here to play @entity71 , either			0
" ultimately , @entity3 said , he is sorry for a man who feels the need to execute unarmed personnel , his comrades , in the name of @entity71			1
does he pity the @entity4 shooter ? " yeah , " he said , pausing			1
" @entity2 's @entity200 and @entity201 contributed to this report .			2
