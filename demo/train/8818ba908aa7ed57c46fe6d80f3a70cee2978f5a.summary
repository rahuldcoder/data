president @entity0 has signed into law a bill to avert the fiscal cliff , a day after the @entity4 and @entity5 approved the much - debated legislation			1
@entity0 , who returned to his family vacation in @entity8 after tuesday 's @entity4 vote , signed the bill via autopen on wednesday			1
but new battles over taxes and spending await @entity15 in the next few weeks			0
@entity16 averted that self - built precipice late tuesday when the @entity4 voted to stave off widespread tax increases and deep spending cuts by accepting a brokered @entity5 compromise			1
it makes permanent the @entity24 administration 's tax cuts for individuals earning less than $ 400,000 per year and couples earning less than $ 450,000			1
it raises rates on those who make more than that from 35 % to 39.6 % , bringing back a top tax bracket from the @entity33 administration , and will raise roughly $ 600 billion in new revenues over 10 years , according to various estimates			1
the bill also extends unemployment insurance and delays for two months the threat of sequestration -- a series of automatic , across - the - board cuts in federal spending			1
economists had predicted the combination of those tax increases and spending cuts could have thrown the @entity49 economy back into recession and driven unemployment back into the 9 % range			1
meanwhile , a new @entity16 takes office on thursday , and lawmakers will soon be confronted by the need to raise the federal debt ceiling and what to do about the still - hanging sequester -- a legacy of the last battle over the debt ceiling , in 2011			0
read more : five things about the fiscal cliff " the sum total of all the budget agreements we 've reached so far proves that there is a path forward that is possible , if we focus not on our politics but on what 's right for the country , " @entity0 told reporters late tuesday , after the @entity4 approved the fiscal cliff deal			1
" and the one thing that i think , hopefully , in the new year , we 'll focus on is seeing if we can put a package like this together with a little bit less drama , a little less brinksmanship , not scare the heck out of folks quite as much			0
" the @entity24 tax cuts expired at midnight monday , while sequestration had been scheduled to start when federal offices reopened wednesday			2
world markets rose after the late - night vote			2
@entity49 stocks jumped , too , with the @entity89 rising nearly 2 % by mid-afternoon			1
rum , electric vehicles and motor sports : nuggets in bill tuesday night 's 257 - 167 vote saw @entity96 , @entity97 , and about a third of the @entity100 majority lining up with @entity101 against most of their own caucus , including majority leader @entity104 and party whip @entity105			1
rep. @entity106 , an outgoing @entity100 representative from @entity107 , said she was a " reluctant yes			2
" " this is the best we can do , given the @entity5 and the @entity4 sentiment at this point in time , and it is at least a partial victory for the @entity49 people , " @entity106 said			1
" i 'll take that at this point			0
" the @entity5 plan was brokered by vice president @entity117 and @entity5 minority leader @entity118 , @entity119 , and it passed that @entity101 - led chamber 89 - 8			0
but many @entity121 complained the bill did too little to cut spending while raising taxes for them to support it			0
@entity96 's @entity4 f - bomb conservative lobbyist @entity127 , whose @entity128 pushes candidates to sign a pledge never to raise taxes , said the plan preserves most of the @entity24 tax cuts and wo n't violate his group 's beliefs			1
" the @entity24 tax cuts lapsed at midnight last night , " @entity127 tweeted tuesday			1
" every ( @entity100 ) voting for @entity5 bill is cutting taxes and keeping his / her pledge			2
" but rep. @entity141 , @entity142 , told @entity148 's " @entity147 " that @entity0 convinced @entity96 " to undo everything he promised he would do " after the 2010 elections that gave the @entity100 control of the @entity4			1
" they did a debt ceiling deal , gave the president $ 2.1 trillion , " @entity141 said			0
" they turned that deal off for two months			0
that 's going to be another fight on top of the sequestration , a debt ceiling fight			0
" @entity159 : what 's your message for @entity15 ? other republicans warned that as they did in 2011 , they 'll be demanding additional cuts before they agree to raise the federal cap on borrowing			2
" the president has maxed out his credit card , and he is not going to get an unlimited credit card , " sen. @entity166 , @entity167 , told @entity148			0
" we 're going to talk specifically about cuts and specifically focused on tax reform as well as helping to save and strengthen @entity174 and @entity175			2
and that 's the next discussion we 're going to have in @entity15			0
" the federal government bumped up against its $ 16.4 trillion debt ceiling on monday and has about two months before it runs out of ways to shuffle money around to keep @entity15 within its legal borrowing limit			0
@entity0 had sought to resolve the issue as part of the fiscal cliff negotiations , but the issue never made it to a final bill			2
tuesday night , the president warned @entity16 that he will not tolerate another round of brinksmanship that could have " catastrophic " effects on the global economy			1
" while i will negotiate over many things , i will not have another debate with this @entity16 over whether or not they should pay the bills that they 've already racked up through the laws that they 've passed , " he said			0
how they voted : @entity4 @entity5 the last debt - ceiling battle led to the sequester , a kind of fiscal doomsday device that @entity16 was supposed to disarm by agreeing to more than $ 1 trillion in other cuts over the next decade			2
they did n't , leaving federal agencies preparing to slash spending by $ 110 billion by the end of the 2013 budget year			1
before tuesday night , the @entity211 had been preparing to issue furlough notices for its entire civilian work force of 800,000			1
those notices were stayed on wednesday -- but @entity211 officials say they 're worried that unpaid leave may be harder to implement later in the fiscal year			0
" we hope @entity16 can find a way to end sequester once and for all , " @entity211 spokesman @entity218 said			0
while the deal gives @entity0 bragging rights for raising income taxes on the wealthiest @entity49 -- the first rate increase for any @entity49 since 1993 -- it also leaves him breaking a promise			1
@entity0 had vowed to raise tax rates for the top - earning 2 % of @entity49 , including those with household income above $ 250,000 and individuals earning more than $ 200,000			1
raising the threshold for higher tax rates shrinks the number of @entity49 affected			1
while nearly 2 % of filers have adjusted gross incomes over $ 250,000 , only 0.6 % have incomes above $ 500,000 , according to the @entity237			0
by comparison , @entity239 figures put the median @entity49 household income at just over $ 50,000			1
and despite the last - minute fiscal cliff agreements , @entity49 are still likely to see their paychecks shrink somewhat because of a separate battle over payroll taxes			0
the government temporarily lowered the payroll tax rate in 2011 from 6.2 % to 4.2 % to put more money in the pockets of @entity49			1
that adjustment , which has cost about $ 120 billion each year , expired monday			0
now , @entity49 earning $ 30,000 a year will take home $ 50 less per month			2
those earning $ 113,700 will lose $ 189.50 a month			0
opinion : @entity254 hollow victory for @entity49 people the legislation also caps itemized deductions for individuals making $ 250,000 and for married couples making $ 300,000			2
taxes on inherited estates over $ 5 million will go up to 40 % from 35 % , and that threshold will be indexed for inflation			0
the alternative minimum tax , a perennial issue , will be permanently adjusted for inflation			0
child care , tuition and research and development tax credits will be renewed			0
the " @entity274 " -- reimbursements for doctors who take @entity174 patients -- will continue , but it wo n't be paid for out of the @entity0 administration 's signature health care law .			2

@entity96 undid " everything he promised he would do " in 2010 , @entity100 lawmaker says
@entity0 calls for " a little less brinksmanship " next time
tuesday night 's vote prevents tax increases for more than *98* % of @entity49
