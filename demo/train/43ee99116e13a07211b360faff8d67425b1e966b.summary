-- home - brewers who may have dreamt about harnessing the power of @entity5 to automate their process may find something to envy in the @entity8 , a project posted to @entity9 monday			1
the machine 's makers purport to automate the process of home - brewing from beginning to end ; owners simply add their ingredients and come back in a while to processed beer and an easy clean - up solution			1
@entity20 and @entity21 , the latter a former @entity24 executive , constructed the first prototype in 2010 using , among other things , an @entity5 controller and a custom heating loop			0
the two teamed up with @entity24 software architect @entity30 in the fall of 2011			0
more recent versions of the @entity34 machine moved to custom @entity36 controller boards and a number of custom parts , some rendered by @entity30 himself			1
with the level of specificity provided by the @entity34 , the founders state that users should be able to turn out recipes " precisely on spec. " the machine can also import @entity46 - formatted recipes and translate and scale them to the @entity34 's setup			1
the machine is sort of an odd meeting ground between the act of homesteading and using science and commercial techniques on a consumer level			0
the founders cite the amount of work and hands - on time home - brewing requires , although that 's part of the charm for some enthusiasts			2
at $ 1,300 , it 's not really for the casual home - brewer			0
the @entity34 has more potential clients in commercial craft breweries			0
one source in the @entity9 video , @entity64 of @entity67 brewery , notes that the machine could be used for quickly testing the quality of ingredients before committing to their use in a full batch			2

a @entity9 *campaign* seeks to automate the *small* - scale beer *creation* process
the @entity78 automates some steps of *beermaking* , but it 's not cheap
the machine can import recipes and scale them to the @entity34 's setup
