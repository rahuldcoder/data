its main role is to advise the current @entity2 and pick his successor			1
" this is the most exclusive club in the @entity37 , " said @entity36 , @entity1 's @entity4 analyst			0
" in many cases , you also become , at least informally , a candidate to be the next pope , because the next pope will almost certainly come from the roughly 120 cardinals under the age of 80			0
" once a cardinal reaches 80 , he is no longer able to participate in the election of the pope or enter the secret conclave where cardinals gather when the time comes to select the next pope , typically upon the prior pope 's death			0

" emphasizing the importance of service over self - interest , the pontiff said the red of the cardinals ' hats was symbolic of the ultimate sacrifice they would make if required			0
" the new cardinals are entrusted with the service of love : love for @entity87 , love for his church , an absolute and unconditional love for his brothers and sisters , even unto shedding their blood , if necessary , as expressed in the words of placing the biretta and as indicated by the color of their robes , " he said			0
