-- @entity1 was @entity0 's senior correspondent in @entity2 throughout 1989 , witnessing and reporting on the momentous events of that year from the first protests in the communist @entity5 to the fall of the @entity7 and revolution in @entity9			1
@entity0 's @entity1 reports from the former @entity10 in 1990			1
the following year @entity1 traveled the length of the former @entity10 to report on the new @entity2 emerging from its shadow			1
here he recalls how the the divided continent had simply become the only reality that most people knew			1
like the stop sign on the street or the wastebasket in the corner of the living room			1
like a long , long overcast day			1
growing up in @entity24 the @entity25 , the @entity26 confrontation and the prospect of @entity28 were so prosaic you never really thought much about them			1
you could n't remember anything different			1
the situation seemed as immutable as the profile of the mountain tops or the patterns of stars in the night sky			1
and then , when i was 53 , in the length of a football season , it was gone			1
if you 're reading this online , chances are you do n't remember and ca n't ever know what it was like in the days before the collapse of communism			1
there was " @entity49 , " a jingly film that showed little @entity24 children what to do in the event of nuclear attack			2
in later years , the black humor			2
@entity57 's line about " someone will set the spark off and we will all be blown away			2
" nothing to get excited about			2
if you were male , the @entity24 draft loomed ahead , promising to take anything from six months to four years from your civilian life			2
maybe more than that if you were in the @entity68 or @entity69 age group			2
during the cuban missile crisis of 1962 , i was flying back and forth over the @entity72 in a @entity74 patrol plane for 15 hours a day , not knowing what the hell was going on , trying not to dwell on the orders that could send us on a one - way mining trip to @entity80 if the balloon went up			1
for @entity85 and others along the line that divided @entity2 , the symbols of the threat of war were still harder to ignore			1
in @entity91 in 1956 and in @entity88 in 1968 @entity90 troops had helped crush efforts to loosen @entity94 's grip			1
but ignore them they did			2
" we could n't think about the wall , so we did n't , " said the mayor of a @entity101 village standing right on the border , when we talked to him in 1990			2
" the bushes had eyes , " @entity101 border guard @entity104 told us , describing the creepy job of patrolling a few yards from the binoculars and guns of their @entity110 counterparts			2
very few of the people we taxpayers paid to know about such things had any idea how close the collapse was			2
a couple of years before , the former @entity101 chancellor @entity119 had advised me tartly to quit asking whether @entity85 would ever be reunited			0
not in his lifetime or mine , he said			0
when it came , we were all surprised we had n't seen it coming			0
the @entity126 and @entity91 had been levering into chinks in the wall for years			0
the rulers of the @entity5 were largely aged , ossified , inflexible and corrupt , and those who served them were all that plus scared			0
their system was beyond repair			1
along came @entity134 , the first @entity90 leader born after the @entity136 revolution , who saw things as they were and was tired of pouring money into a clapped - out old car			1
he became a hero to young people in the @entity110			0
near the end of august , activists from @entity110 and @entity144 had celebrated a " @entity148 " on the now - neutered border between @entity91 and @entity147			1
a few weeks later , the rush was on			0
@entity0 poured resources into the story			0
i was there , and will always be glad that i was			0
@entity126 , @entity85 , @entity88 , @entity154			0
and finally , at the end of the year , poor tortured , abused @entity9 threw off the system in what i found the most emotionally charged days of the whole upheaval			1
but i was never satisfied with the way the @entity144 received it all			0
we had become used to instant gratification , and this was an example			0
the drama was over , the commercials came on , and world was supposed to live happily ever after			0
the whole experience made me realize that liberty is not a thing			0
it is a way of life			0
if you do n't practice it , you do n't have it			0
a couple of months later , three of us made a journey along the line to check on what was happening			0
we called it the @entity183			0
but that 's another story ...			0

@entity1 : @entity26 divide was " like a long , long overcast day "
