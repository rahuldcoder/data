four people have been arrested in connection with last week 's coal mine fire in @entity6 , @entity7 , that killed 301 miners , the country 's semiofficial @entity1 news agency reported			1
@entity10 operating manager @entity9 , engineers @entity11 and @entity13 , and security chief @entity14 were taken into custody sunday , the agency said , citing @entity7 prosecutor @entity17			1
twenty - five people were detained and questioned , @entity1 reported			2
the search for victims of tuesday 's fire ended saturday			1
authorities believe they have now recovered the bodies of all the workers who perished			0
the investigation into what caused the deadliest disaster in @entity7 mining history continues , the @entity25 said			2
the last bodies were pulled out saturday afternoon , @entity7 energy minister @entity30 said			1
however , as the recovery effort comes to an end , controversy over prime minister @entity34 's response to the tragedy refuses to blow over			1
on friday , police in @entity6 used tear gas , plastic pellets and a water cannon on protesters angered by the government 's response			1
the protesters , dressed mostly in black , chanted " do n't sleep , @entity6 , remember your dead ! " as they passed through city streets a few miles from the disaster site trying to reach a statue honoring miners			1
amid a rising tide of discontent , local authorities have banned protests in @entity6 and apparently clamped down on those taking part			2
lawyers ' representatives told @entity7 broadcaster @entity60 that eight lawyers and 25 other citizens were detained saturday			2
the lawyers were in town to try to help represent families of the dead miners			0
@entity68 , the governor of @entity70 province , where @entity6 is located , declined to say how many people had been detained over the protests			1
but he told reporters that the authorities decided friday to ban rallies and demonstrations in @entity6 to maintain peace and security			2
" this is not to prevent freedom of expression , " he said			0
distrust of the government is running high in certain sectors of society , with some voicing doubts about the official count of those missing , while others question the fact no one has yet taken responsibility for the tragedy			0
some are also critical of the authorities ' use of tear gas and the water cannon against demonstrators			0
@entity11 's missteps public anger has been fueled in part by @entity11 's own missteps while visiting the scene of the disaster wednesday			0
first , @entity11 's comments to relatives of dead and injured miners , in which he described the disaster as par for the course in a dangerous business , were seen as highly insensitive and drew scathing criticism			0
then video taken on the same day in @entity6 showed @entity11 telling a man " do n't be nasty , " according to the footage aired friday by @entity60			1
the remarks initially reported and translated by @entity60 were confirmed by a @entity120 native @entity7 speaker			1
... if you boo the country 's prime minister , you get slapped , " @entity11 is heard saying			1
that was after another video clip emerged showing a crowd outside a grocery store angrily booing @entity11			0
as the prime minister entered the crowded store , he appeared to put his arm around the neck of a man who was later identified as a miner			1
after the confrontation , the video captured what appeared to be @entity11 's security guards beating the same man to the floor			2
the miner said later that @entity11 slapped him , possibly by mistake			0
he wants an apology for the way he was treated by the prime minister 's staff			1
in addition , a photograph of an aide to @entity11 kicking a protester surfaced wednesday , an image that quickly became a symbol of the anger felt by many against the government , and amid mounting questions over safety practices at the mine			2
@entity162 , a spokesman for the ruling @entity163 , dismissed the grocery store incident and said the image of the aide , @entity166 , kicking the protester was misleading			0
@entity166 was quoted by the @entity1 news agency thursday as saying that he had been deeply saddened by the previous day 's events			0
" i am sad that i could not keep my calm in the face of all the provocation , insults and attacks that i was subjected to that day , " he reportedly said			0
questions over safety chambers the mine complex exploded in flames for unknown reasons tuesday , trapping many miners deep underground			0
among other issues , mine officials indicated friday that workers may not have had access to an emergency refuge where they could have taken shelter from the flames and choking fumes			2
the owner of the company , @entity190 , said the mine met the highest standards laid out by the law in @entity7			1
the company , he said , had no legal obligation to build safety chambers			0
asked about that issue , minister of labor and social security @entity198 defended @entity7 's workplace safety act and said it was set up within the framework of @entity204 regulations , according to @entity205			1
" this is a dynamic area , " he said , adding that it is the duty of each company to ensure workers ' safety needs are met			0
" could people be sent to death because a certain sentence is not in the regulations ? " he asked			2
@entity214 said it had dropped @entity190 and a fellow @entity216 manager , @entity215 , from an advisory panel in its mining faculty , following protests and an occupation by students at the university , @entity205 reported			0
political bonfire hundreds also took to the streets last week in anti-government protests in @entity227 and @entity228 , with police answering , in some cases , with water cannons and tear gas			0
as @entity11 took a stroll through @entity6 , onlookers showered him with deafening jeers as well as chants of " resign , prime minister ! " foreign minister @entity238 defended @entity11 in an interview with @entity120 's @entity240 on thursday			1
" he was feeling all these pains in his heart , " he said			0
" everybody knows that our prime minister is always with the people , and always feels the pain of the people			1
otherwise , he would n't get such a high support in eight elections in ( the ) last 10 years			0
" but the disaster opened up an old political wound			0
opposition politician @entity253 , who is from the @entity70 region , which includes @entity6 , filed a proposal in late april to investigate @entity7 mines after repeated deadly accidents			1
@entity11 's government rejected the proposal			2
it claimed that the mine , owned by @entity262 , had passed recent inspections			0
a @entity7 engineers ' association criticized mine ventilation and safety equipment last week as being " insufficient and old			1
" a lack of safety inspections has caused 100 coal mines to be closed in the last three years , according to @entity7 's @entity271			1
president @entity273 , speaking as he visited @entity6 on thursday , said he was sure the investigation already begun would " shed light " on what regulations are needed			2
" whatever is necessary will be done , " he said			0
despair , anger , dwindling hope after @entity7 coal mine fire			1

four people , including engineers and a manager , are arrested , says prosecutor
search efforts are now over with a confirmed death toll of 301 , government officials say
" if you boo the country 's prime minister , you get slapped , " @entity7 's @entity292 says in video
