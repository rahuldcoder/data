-- only moments after @entity4 began reading his apology friday , writers , pundits and tweeters largely split into two camps : those who felt that his words were a heartfelt effort to acknowledge wrongs and set them right , and those who did n't believe a word of it			1
@entity15 , in the @entity14 , was unconvinced : " prisoners of war reading prepared denunciations of @entity19 imperialism look more comfortable than @entity4 did friday , apologizing for his ' selfish and irresponsible ' behavior			1
never relaxed and easygoing in front of a tv camera in the best of times , @entity4 was a man saying the right things out loud while everything about his demeanor was silently screaming , ' i do n't want to be here			1
' his eyes occasionally moving around the room as he worked to enunciate his scripted remarks clearly , @entity4 looked like a man who had caught his leg in a bear trap			1
" by contrast , @entity37 's @entity36 took @entity4 at his word : " this was a real person with real flaws and real failures that he really acknowledged			1
@entity4 has always preferred to sell an image instead of being himself ; this was obvious even before he crashed his car last @entity47			1
ironically , at the moment when @entity4 's image is most at risk , he finally showed us who he is			1
... a lot of us have trouble apologizing to our spouse or our boss when we make a mistake			2
think about what it must be like to apologize to the world			2
i do n't know what else people can ask of the guy			2
" at beliefnet.com , rabbi @entity65 was convinced that the apology was heartfelt : " @entity4 ' statement was a model of repentance and contrition			1
he admitted he had a problem			2
he said that words alone would not solve it , that he requires , and is receiving counseling			2
he admitted that celebrity and money had given him a sense of entitlement and had corrupted him			2
he said he had behaved selfishly and irresponsibly			0
he accepted that being a public figure meant private responsibility and that he had to model good behavior for the youth			0
and he looked the entire time like he meant it			0
it was that rarest of things , a sincere and unconditional statement of contrition and responsibility from a public figure for cheating on his wife			0
" @entity94 's @entity93 called the apology " a borderline train wreck " and said : " it amazes me that @entity4 learned little to nothing from the past two months			1
the control freak whose life slipped out of control dipped right back into control - freak mode , reading a prepared speech in front of a hand - selected audience of people , taking no questions , talking in clich√©s and only occasionally seeming human			0
everything about it seemed staged			0
when the main camera broke down at the nine - minute mark and @entity4 had to be shown from the side , i half - expected to see that he was plugged in to the wall			1
" @entity0 legal analyst @entity119 had a different take , saying that while @entity4 hit a " home run " in acknowledging that he had a mistaken view of what his fame entitled him to , the most significant thing about the apology was the absence of his wife , @entity128 : " @entity129 joins the more recent and growing list -- @entity131 , @entity132 -- who stand out for not standing by their husbands ' public confessionals			1
famous wives are public figures themselves , however reluctantly , and serve as role models for girls and women who watch their moves carefully			0
@entity128 's absence says this : i am not a doormat			0
she may forgive , or not ; she may stay , or not			0
that 's her private business			0
but she refused to be part of the public spectacle ... and that is as it should be			0
" @entity153 , at the @entity152 , wondered why @entity4 bothered to make the statement , saying it just " reignited " the news cycle : " ... it would have been nice if @entity4 had seemed more genuine -- the only real emotion he seemed to be experiencing was anger at the media , and a general air of irritated resignation at having to make this statement in the first place			1
which , of course , he did not			0
the world would have gone on turning without a prepared statement from @entity4			1
but unless @entity4 is planning to retire , to embrace a truly private life , then going out there with a ' i 'm saying this and then i 'm not saying anything more ' is just ridiculous and disingenuous			1
" taking more of the middle ground , @entity175 media columnist @entity174 , who hosts " @entity176 " on @entity0 , said on the @entity175 's site : " it 's not too much to say that this is a man in pain -- self - inflicted , to be sure , but pain nonetheless			0
but putting the tawdriness of the multiple mistresses behind him will probably take more than one carefully controlled television appearance			0
" @entity186 : share your views on @entity4 ' apology even before the apology , there was a bounty of opinion arguing that it was n't a good idea			1
the pseudonymous " @entity196 " at @entity197 begged @entity4 not to apologize in this blog post : " this nation is an apology factory			1
people are held up to impossible standards , or even possible ones , and fail to live up to them , as people will , and then the apology machine goes into action and will not shut down again until it runs its course , or is denied of fuel			2
you are simply giving it more fuel			0
... i hope i 'm not too late			0
you 're scheduled to apologize again this morning			0
perhaps you wo n't get this advice until it 's too late			2
if so , you know what ? it 's still good			0
you ca n't unapologize now			2
but let that be it , forever			0
say you 're sorry , if necessary , to the one person to whom you genuinely owe an apology			2
no , it 's not @entity225			0
" and @entity226 , at @entity37 , faulted @entity4 for stealing the spotlight from @entity229 athletes at the @entity230 who were getting well - earned recognition : " the @entity229 have earned their enthusiasm , and all the coverage and headlines that go with it			1
now @entity4 wants to eclipse their sunshine by crashing their bash with his own pity party			1
... the days of seeing the @entity229 through the prism of olympians @entity241 have seemed a scene of the past at these games			0
then @entity4 , the nation 's gold - medal bad boy , surfaces , demanding equal time			1
once again , @entity4 could n't help himself			1
" @entity0 contributor @entity249 said he was n't looking for an apology : " i 'm sick of these sanctimonious folks who are blabbering about @entity4 needing to be grilled about his private behavior			1
look , @entity4 did n't cheat on me			1
he 's not my daddy , brother , cousin , church member , neighbor or friend			0
he did n't let me down or crush my view of him			2
he is not and never was my role model			0

@entity4 apologized friday and said he was working on *repairing* damage he caused
immediate opinion divided , with one group saying he showed *vulnerability* and sincerity
another group said apology was scripted and did n't seem heartfelt
