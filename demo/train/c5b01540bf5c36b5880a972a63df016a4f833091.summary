@entity0 -- removing @entity3 from power was the right move , but the @entity6 made mistakes in the aftermath , former secretary of state @entity2 told @entity1 on friday			1
in an interview to be broadcast monday on @entity12 's " @entity13 " program , @entity9 acknowledged a failure to focus rebuilding efforts throughout the country and attributed the problem to a lack of understanding			2
" i do believe i would take @entity3 out of power again , but of course in the rebuilding of @entity23 ... i would do things differently , " @entity9 said			1
" i think we put too much emphasis on @entity27 and not enough emphasis on the provinces			0
perhaps we did n't fully understand the degree to which the society would start to come apart as a result of being held in tyranny for all those years			2
" at the same time , @entity9 said it is still too early to fully judge the success or failure of that war or other foreign policy issues in the administration of @entity40			2
" sometimes things that look terrific at the time look pretty bad in retrospect , and vice versa , so ultimately this is a story that will be written in history , " said @entity9 , who served as secretary of state for the second of @entity40 's two four - year terms as president			1
@entity9 had a full day in @entity0 planned , including several interviews , two speeches and a @entity55 meeting with president @entity56			1
a memoir on her childhood , as well as a version for young readers , came out this week			0
the invitation from a sitting president to a former @entity65 member is " not that unusual , " @entity9 said , adding that she believes they 'll discuss " a range of foreign policy issues			2
" " it 's whatever the president wants to talk about , " she said			0
@entity56 has criticized the @entity40 administration for shifting focus from @entity75 to @entity23 , which he says stalled the effort to vanquish the @entity78 insurgency and prevent @entity75 from again becoming a haven for @entity80 and other terrorists to launch attacks against the @entity6			1
@entity55 spokesman @entity83 told reporters friday that with @entity9 scheduled to be in @entity0 , @entity56 wanted to " chat " with her			1
@entity83 said a wide range of foreign policy issues would be discussed			0
@entity9 spoke further about @entity23 when answering questions after a luncheon speech at the @entity91 , saying the purpose of the @entity6 invasion was to get rid of the threat posed by @entity3			1
" we did n't go to war in @entity23 to democratize @entity23 , " she said , adding that the @entity6 did n't fight @entity96 in @entity97 to democratize @entity98			1
" you go to war when there is a security threat , and @entity3 was seen as a threat to our interests and our security , " @entity9 said			1
while acknowledging that " we could have done many , many things much , much better , " she noted that removing @entity3 from power changed @entity23 for the better			2
" what is the conversation we 're having about @entity23 today ? " she asked , noting it did n't involve weapons of mass destruction and other issues from the @entity3 era			2
instead , it 's about whether @entity118 and @entity119 factions can form a coalition government , she said			0
@entity9 , the second @entity121 in history to serve as secretary of state , also said that while race relations in @entity6 have improved enormously in her lifetime , " there is no more sensitive or more difficult issue in the @entity6 than race			1
" " this is not a color - blind society , " she said			1
" when somebody walks in the door , you do see color			0
" asked about her possible political future , @entity9 made clear she has no plans to run for office any time soon			2
she said she keeps responding to the question by saying the time 's not right , and added : " maybe the time is n't ever going to be right			0
" " i got to be secretary of state , " @entity9 said			1
" that 's quite enough			0
" in her interview with @entity12 , @entity9 also commented on domestic issues			0
asked about the conservative @entity148 movement in the @entity6 that has roiled @entity150 politics , @entity9 said there is no reason to fear such grass - roots democratic expression , even if she differs with @entity148 supporters on some issues			1
" the @entity148 is , of course , a vast collection of people and there are lots of views which i would not associate with -- i am a free trader and i believe in defending immigration -- but the best way to understand the @entity148 is that it really is a grass - roots movement , and in that sense it 's healthy , " she said			0
@entity9 attributed the rise of the @entity148 movement to " a sense that @entity0 , with big government and deficit spending , has lost touch			1
" on her successor at the helm of the @entity177 , @entity9 said @entity178 is doing a " fine job			0
" " it 's a tough job , " she said			0
" you 're always on an airplane			0
sometimes you never quite know what country you 're in , and you 're always hoping you 're not going to make the mistake and say you 're in a country that you 're not in			0
i did it on one occasion , but i hope no one noticed			0
