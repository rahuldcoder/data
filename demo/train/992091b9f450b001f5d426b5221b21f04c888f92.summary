-- @entity3 whistle - blower @entity2 did not just review numbers on a spreadsheet , she emphasized to @entity0 , but worked with the " overwhelming majority " of the athletes she analyzed in a study about literacy -- one that was summarily dismissed by university officials the same day			1
her findings , that 8 % of a sample of @entity3 students playing the money - making college sports of football and basketball were reading below a 3rd grade level , were met with scathing criticism by the university during a faculty council meeting friday afternoon			2
in the meeting , provost @entity23 said the university 's initial analysis of @entity2 's research determined that she made a " range of serious mistakes " in how she arrived at the reading levels of the athletes she assessed			1
@entity23 said @entity2 used the wrong measurement , and relied on data that is n't supposed to be used to determine the grade level of reading comprehension			1
a second independent analysis of her research will be sought , @entity23 said			0
" our judgment at this point is that claims made based on this data set are nearly meaningless and grossly unfair to our students			1
" the university has not explained why it did not do this analysis , or take the time to review her claims , prior to a @entity0 report on the literacy of college athletes			2
@entity0 had asked for comment on @entity2 's study as early as september			2
@entity2 said after the meeting : " my data is 100 % correct			1
in addition , i worked with the overwhelming majority of the students in the data set on reading and writing skills between 2004 and 2010			0
" @entity2 's study was part of a report by @entity0 on @entity3 -- and dozens of other public universities -- and whether student - athletes in revenue sports are able to keep up with their peers academically			1
after meeting with university officials in the wake of the @entity0 story , @entity2 got a letter informing her that her approval to research using university records was being pulled because she broke a rule related to having the identities of the athletes she was studying			1
she immediately said she would reapply to continue her research			0
" it 's interesting that my ( permission to do research ) was pulled and i was told that i could not talk about it until it was resolved			0
meanwhile the provost is allowed to discuss the findings , " @entity2 said , talking about the rescinding of her permission to continue research			2
" that is what is truly erroneous about all of this -- and at a research university -- wow			0
at @entity3 , we protect our brand at all costs			2
" " the gap in academic preparedness between profit - sport athletes and students at @entity103 ( @entity104 ) institutions perpetuates educational inequality , " @entity2 said			1
" until we acknowledge the problem , and fix it , many of our athletes , specifically men 's basketball and football players , are getting nothing in exchange for their special talents			0
" @entity2 is one of just two people in the country @entity0 found who have researched the reading levels of student - athletes in the revenue - generating sports of football and basketball			1
in talking to @entity0 , she also shared several compelling stories about working with unnamed student - athletes who could not write , could not sound out multisyllabic words and who could not have read a paragraph when they started school at @entity3			1
@entity0 also sought data from 37 other public universities			0
it asked for entrance exam scores of athletes on the sat and @entity134 , because the kind of research that @entity2 did is simply not available from other institutions			1
since september , @entity3 has been aware of @entity0 's reporting and was asked to comment several times including on @entity2 's research			1
the university said it could not comment on her findings or methodology			0
not until after the story aired did the university release any data			0
on thursday , it released an analysis of entrance exam scores that included all student - athletes --- not just the profit sport players			0
based on that analysis , @entity3 said @entity2 was wrong about the percentage of athletes who were not academically prepared for the rigors of college classes			1
included in the @entity3 analysis was a disclosure that 34 football or basketball players since 2004 scored below a 400 on the @entity133 verbal test , or below a 16 on the @entity134 reading and @entity162 test			2
at those levels , experts have told @entity0 a student would not be able to read a college text book			0
@entity3 , again , disputes that expert opinion , and says all but four of those athletes are in , left in or graduated in good academic standing			1
it 's not the first time @entity3 has faced questions about the quality of its academics for athletes			2
two years ago , a scandal was unearthed where students , many of them athletes , were given grades for classes they did n't attend , and where they did nothing more than turn in a single paper			0
the local newspaper , @entity185 , did extensive reporting on that no - show class scandal and , based on public records and interviews , uncovered how counselors with the athletes ' tutoring program used the fake classes to help keep academically challenged athletes eligible to play sports			0
@entity2 , who has been vocal in her criticism since that scandal was uncovered , informed the university of her latest research as far back as august .			0

@entity3 claims @entity2 made " serious mistakes "
@entity2 was *shocked* by the number of @entity3 athletes who *struggled* to read
she stands by her data
@entity3 releases own data
