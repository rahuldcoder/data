when i was growing up , i had everything i needed			0
my wonderful parents , @entity3 and @entity4 , made sure we had nutritious food and they taught us where food came from			0
i have been blessed in many ways , and my wife , @entity10 , and i have been fortunate enough to pass that on to our own four daughters			0
we 've never had to worry about how we 'd feed our family			0
other families in @entity15 are not as fortunate as i have been			1
few @entity15 realize that the majority of low - income children in this country get most of their nutrition at school			1
whether it 's the free breakfast , reduced - priced lunch or after - school snacks , these federally funded meal programs provide a critical safety net for families struggling to put food on the table			1
however , there is a huge gap in the number of children who could be getting these meals and the number actually accessing them			1
for instance , many children are not getting the food they need in the summer			1
when school is out , many children lose their primary source of nutrition			0
of the 20 million children who get lunch at school during the regular school year , only 1 in 7 are getting free meals in the summertime			1
the breakfast statistics are sobering as well			0
of the same 20 million children who get lunch at school , only 10.5 million kids are eating school breakfast			2
that kind of gap is unacceptable			0
kids who come to school hungry get sick more frequently			2
they have more trouble concentrating on their schoolwork and struggle with their studies			0
this has a huge effect on their potential for success later in life , and that 's not good for our country			0
as my good friend ( and founder of @entity71 ) @entity70 always says , we ca n't have a strong @entity15 with weak kids			1
that 's where the @entity75 campaign works so beautifully			1
it connects kids to the healthy food they need every day , where they live , learn and play			2
this happens through partnerships with schools , mayors , state governors , political leaders , nonprofit organizations , corporations , chefs , celebrities such as me and with people like you			0
the campaign works to come up with innovative ways to bridge this gap			2
for example , moving school breakfast out of the cafeteria and into the classroom -- where everyone eats together -- means more kids start the day with a healthy meal			2
breakfast after the bell programs have already been championed in cities such as @entity105 and @entity106 , and they 're working really well			0
there is good news for kids who need meals this summer , too			1
the @entity111 -- a federally funded program -- provides free meals for people 18 and younger in cities all across @entity15			1
this year , a national texting program has been put in place to help connect even more kids to meals			1
and no @entity75 's @entity120 ensures kids are getting healthy meals at home by empowering low - income families with the skills to shop smarter , use nutrition information and cook delicious , affordable meals			1
our children are our future , and it 's up to me -- and to all of us -- to make sure we prepare them to be productive citizens and thrive in our communities			0
ensuring our kids have the nutritious food they need is the very first step to getting them there			2
join me in making no kid hungry a reality .			0
