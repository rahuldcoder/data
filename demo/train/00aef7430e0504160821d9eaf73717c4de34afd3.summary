-- there are few philosophers whose very name provokes more violent responses than @entity5			1
his stern face , framed by a mass of gray hair , symbolizes for many @entity10 the costly battles of the 20th century : battles against communism , socialism , and authoritarianism fought in defense of democracy and free - market capitalism			1
as successive generations of @entity10 waged those fights , the philosophical disputes at the core of the conflicts embedded themselves into the @entity10 soul			1
so much so that when the " evil empire , " whose seeds sprouted from @entity5 's doctrine , died as a result of the revolutions of 1989 , the ideological battle did not			1
though the @entity31 is but a memory , and that other communist behemoth -- @entity36 -- has mutated into a capitalist autocracy , the specter of @entity5 himself remains as potent as ever in 21st century @entity10 political discourse			1
since 2008 especially , with the fall of financial markets and the rise of @entity42 , the charge " @entity44 " has been hurled like toxic sludge against politicians seen as ready to redistribute wealth ( to the advantage of most @entity10 ) , expand social safety nets , or ensure that all children receive a good education			1
critics say these steps are merely the first along a slippery slope that inevitably ends in outright state control			0
amid these warnings , the communist horrors of the 20th century float like dark apparitions , reminding us of the bad old days			0
but i wonder how many of those who invoke the name of @entity5 in order to stifle political debate actually believe their own propaganda			1
or are they conjuring up a convenient bogeyman at a time of great uncertainty			0
do they raise @entity5 's image in order to deflect attention from slightly warmer bodies ( @entity5 has been dead for 128 years ) in positions of political or economic power who are actually more pernicious ? i also wonder whether those who use @entity5 's name , and those who tremble at the thought of him , actually know much about the man			1
are they reacting to @entity5 or those things done in his name ? i believe it is the latter			1
i also believe it is time to understand @entity5 so that we are no longer made to fear him			1
when i began working on a biography of @entity5 's family in 2003 , i was well acquainted with his theories			1
i knew , as most do , the history of the governments formed to reflect the state he had supposedly envisioned			0
i knew of the atrocities committed by those said to be his followers			0
i had not , however , been properly introduced to the man himself			0
what i discovered was not what i expected			0
@entity5 was a middle - class philosopher , economist , and journalist ( whose main employer was a @entity108 newspaper )			1
he was also flawed in the extreme			0
he drank excessively , behaved shamefully in his home life , and worked obsessionally , though he produced little that earned him money or recognition during his lifetime			0
these flaws , however , made him more interesting because , despite being in a state of near constant personal crisis , he was able to accomplish what he set out to do -- he changed the world			0
@entity5 began his opposition activities as a youth in @entity122 against an absolute monarch who could not see , or perhaps chose not to see , that society was changing			1
the industrial revolution was spreading eastward and @entity127 businessmen were eager to expand with it			1
but the old system of government would not allow for such progress			0
the king would not allow the democratic reforms that were the handmaidens of the new industrial order			1
this was @entity5 's first battle , to expose the contradictions between the centuries - old monarchical system and the world as it existed in the first half of the 19th century			1
according to @entity5 , it was only natural that as the means of production changed -- in this case a move from an agricultural base to an industrial one -- society would be altered			1
and if , as he believed , a government 's sole function was to serve the people , then government must also change			0
@entity5 saw this social evolution as inevitable			1
it only became revolution when the kings and their minions refused to reform			0
by the 1850s , the industrialists had gained political power after revolts across @entity162 in 1848 caused kings to view proto - capitalists as allies against radicalized lower classes			1
the wheels of industry were humming , as were the halls of finance , where a new breed of speculator was born , addicted to risk in his quest for ever greater profit			0
@entity5 quickly recognized that capitalism would institutionalize social and economic instability			1
the system 's inherent hunger for new markets , new consumers , new and cheaper methods of production in order to increase the flow of capital would result in a destructive system of boom and bust			0
after each cataclysm , he predicted , the number of capitalists at the top of the pyramid would be smaller , while the base of disaffected workers grew			0
gradually even the middle class would be included			2
@entity5 believed that industrial capitalism had also created a new system of repression and exploitation			2
politically and socially men were no more equal under this new order than they had been under a monarchy			0
rights belonged to those with money and property ; those with only a strong back or skilled hands could not even vote			0
financially , those filling the ranks of the industrial workforce were arguably worse off			0
there was evidence aplenty to support @entity5 's assessment			2
he lived in @entity217 , the richest city in the world			0
and yet as great as was its wealth , much greater was its poverty			0
in @entity5 's neighborhood , some people rented a space in a bed and called it comfort			1
others paid for a few inches on a stairwell and called it home			0
@entity5 summed up the situation saying , " there must be something rotten in the very core of a social system which increases its wealth without diminishing its misery			2
" this is the field where @entity5 's ideas grew			1
he famously spent year after year in the @entity239 , trying to understand this new system , predict its course , and , finally , offer an alternative			0
throughout the 16 years before he produced his greatest literary work @entity244 , @entity5 's family lived in near continual destitution			2
their sole consolation was that they believed @entity5 's work was noble and important , and that their suffering was small compared with the majority of people who sacrificed their lives so someone else could live in luxury			1
@entity244 and @entity5 's other political - economic writings were only one aspect of his work			1
he was also an organizer and educator			0
through various small groups , he tried to teach workers , who had neither formal education nor viewed themselves as a political force			2
the courses included language , literature and history , but mostly politics and economics			0
@entity5 was convinced that the only way to successfully change society was to educate the population so that it could eventually lead itself			1
in 1864 , the most important of his many organizational endeavors was born , the @entity274			0
its goal was to connect workers and trade unions throughout @entity162 and @entity10 to protect their rights in the face of an increasingly powerful capitalist system , whose tentacles had spread beyond individual nations and were encircling the globe			2
@entity5 recognized the working man 's greatest power was his number			2
@entity5 died in 1883 , before his books gained a wide readership and before the workers he had been fighting for took their places in government as representatives of labor and socialist political parties			1
it had taken decades of struggle -- largely nonviolent -- for this to occur			0
but @entity5 knew the path to progress would be slow , and that ultimately the best way to re-balance society was through the ballot box			2
he also believed , however , that the working man had the right to revolt if those in power tried to deny him such political expression -- free speech , free assembly , freedom of the press -- and the vote			2
@entity5 's actual vision for a government of the future was vague , which no doubt is why it has produced so many variants			2
but he believed ultimately mankind would naturally evolve out of capitalism and socialism , and embrace a communist society in which government was no longer necessary at all			0
it is a utopian dream that has occurred nowhere -- least of all in the countries most associated with his name			0
today , many people know @entity5 only through the crimes of the former communist countries			1
but @entity5 's ideas also helped give birth to mainstream political parties in @entity162 -- @entity333 's @entity332 , @entity335 's @entity334 , @entity336 's @entity334 , and @entity338 's @entity337			1
and yet , for some reason in @entity10 , these parties are generally not considered part of @entity5 's legacy			1
in the @entity10 , we have been taught to fear @entity5 for so long that we have forgotten those parts of his philosophy that have become integral to our own lives -- from free education to the right to bear arms			1
in fact , the era in modern @entity10 history that was most " marxist " was the 1950s , when union membership was high , personal wealth spread more equitably , and the gap between the rich and poor relatively slim			2
i came away from my @entity5 project believing that rather than demonizing @entity5 , it is better to understand him			2
if his name is used in political discourse , it should be done in the manner of other great thinkers : as a source of ideas			2
whether or not we agree with him , there are lessons to be learned from @entity5			2
to believe otherwise is to ignore a man and a period of history that are crucial to understanding our own			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity374 .			0

@entity374 : @entity5 is potent symbol for @entity10 , is used as political epithet
she wonders whether people who fling @entity44 tag know anything about @entity5
she says @entity5 a middle - class activist trying to lead @entity127 king to democratic reforms
@entity388 : @entity10 taught to fear him , but have adopted some of his ideas , like free education
