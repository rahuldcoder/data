a new survey about preferences and trends in @entity3 concludes that one out of every three @entity3 would migrate to the @entity5 if given the opportunity			1
the survey published tuesday by the @entity9 - based @entity8 also says that of the 34 % of @entity3 who indicated they would like to move to the @entity5 , 17 % " would do so without authorization , " meaning without legal documents			1
@entity14 , senior researcher at the @entity8 , says that attitude has changed little in the past five years			1
" it 's been relatively constant , " @entity14 said			0
" we first asked people about this in 2009 , and the percentage was 33 % , compared to 34 % this year			2
" on the other hand , the survey found that fewer @entity3 have friends or family in the @entity5			1

the number of @entity3 who report having a friend or family member living in the @entity5 has fallen to 32 % , compared with 42 % in 2007			1
