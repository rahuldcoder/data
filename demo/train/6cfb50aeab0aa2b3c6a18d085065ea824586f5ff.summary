but it rejected 38 recommendations that touched on judicial independence , freedom of the press and protection of nongovernmental organizations			1
@entity1 's vice minister of foreign affairs , @entity21 , said that the country rejected these recommendations because they were not legitimate			1
the recommendation process " saw people who came here to disguise as recommendations what are in fact groundless statements , " he said , labeling the rejected suggestions " disrespectful and interfering comments			2
" among the recommendations offered by other countries and rejected by @entity1 were : -- " respect the independence of the judiciary " ( @entity37 ) -- " ensure independent , open and transparent selection procedures based on merit for judges and prosecutors " ( @entity38 ) -- " step up its efforts to guarantee freedom of expression as well as the safety of journalists in the country " ( @entity50 ) @entity21 called these " marginal " recommendations made by " old empires			1
" the @entity11 is a @entity5 body made up of 47 countries and its goal is to address human rights in all @entity5 countries			1
among the council 's duties are a review of every @entity5 member 's progress on the issue of human rights			1
the process , known as the @entity10 , happens every four years			0

for @entity1 , its trio was @entity72 , @entity73 and the @entity74			0

opposition politician @entity83 had argued that he had been unjustly banned from running for office			0
the court agreed , and @entity83 has surged as a top contender to challenge @entity82 in next year 's election , but it remains to be seen if @entity1 will abide by the ruling			2
@entity1 also rejected a call to support the independent work of @entity91 and to defend human rights activists in the country			1
the majority of rejected recommendations were related to accusations that have been lobbed at @entity1 , but rejected by its leaders			2
international groups have accused @entity82 of using a friendly judiciary to silence critics and the press			0
but @entity82 maintains that there is robust freedom of expression in his country			0

during an earlier appearance before the council , @entity1 argued that it had five separate branches of government and noted that women headed three of those			0
the @entity1 @entity131 protects freedom of expression , but those who exercise it will be responsible for that content , the country argued			2
