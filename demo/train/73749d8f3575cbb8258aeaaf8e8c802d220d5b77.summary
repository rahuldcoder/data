but after 200 friends and relatives attended his funeral there two days later , he had to leave -- his body was moved about five miles south to @entity17			0
his father , @entity55 , wanted to bury @entity7 at @entity32 , but needed time for the state of @entity57 to grant permission to bury a person on private grounds , according to the @entity9 website			2
until then , the late singer was put in the crypt at the @entity18 cemetery , soon joined by his mother -- @entity55 's widow , @entity7 -- who also was disinterred and put in the same mausoleum vault			1
the bodies of both son and mother were moved within two months to @entity32 , where visitors pay their respects to them to this day			0
