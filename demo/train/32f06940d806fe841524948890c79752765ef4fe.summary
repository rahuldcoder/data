-- " you drive for show , but putt for dough			2
" that 's the often - repeated mantra of the late @entity6 golfer @entity5 , who put his own words to good use in winning four @entity10 titles			2
good advice for any golfer , but the skills needed to knock a small ball into a slightly bigger hole can be applied in many walks of life outside of the proverbial pleasant amble spoiled			1
" the discipline in setting an immediate , action - orientated target , or job that one is completely in control of , boosts one 's concentration , which is vital for success in every area of life , " @entity20 professor @entity19 told @entity0			1
so , just as top golfers need to do more than just drive a ball 300 - plus yards , success in any sphere depends on combining physical capability with mental focus			0
and the good news is , all it takes is practice			1
the bad news is , it takes a lot of practice			1
@entity19 , who has worked with three - time major champion and fellow @entity20 @entity43 , has utilized his expertise in cognitive psychology to produce the cd " learn to win at @entity49 " and a series of other media releases			1
they aim to improve people 's concentration and performance in academic and sporting situations , and the results are sometimes remarkable -- if not so easy to achieve			0
according to @entity19 , who lectures at @entity57 in @entity58 , research has shown that it takes about 10 years -- or 10,000 hours of practice -- to truly master a skill like putting or playing a musical instrument			1
former @entity64 table tennis star and now @entity66 newspaper columnist @entity65 has written a book called " bounce " on the same theme			0
his theory is that anyone can master the skills to become a top - level performer in sports			1
champions are made not born , is @entity65 's central argument ; the myth of talent and the power of practice is his sub-text			1
" i think everyone who has good hand - eye co-ordination has the capacity to be very good , certainly at an activity like putting , " he says			2
" in my own sport of table tennis , i do n't think there 's anyone who 's reached a high level who actually has faster reaction times than the ordinary person			0
" top golfers such as @entity96 , @entity97 and @entity43 have suffered from poor putting in between bouts of success , so why is it so difficult ? " my feeling is that it is really upstairs , that putting issues have to do with what 's going on between the golfer 's ears , " says dr. @entity101 , a leading @entity102 sports psychologist who has worked with many players on the men 's and women 's @entity102 circuits			1
even the professionals can sometimes seem as fallible as ordinary hackers , but @entity101 believes that what separates the superstars of sport from the average person is an almost superhuman ability to " mono focus " on tasks			0
" i do n't think you can coach self - motivation , " he says			0
putting clearly requires no unusual physical ability , but does rely on the utmost concentration and the ability to shut out all distractions , which is why silence is always demanded when the top players prepare to take their shots			2
" the biggest challenge in putting is keeping yourself focused away from the outcome , " @entity101 says			1
" really good putters just concentrate on the feel and just focus on their body , get a right feel for the distance			0
" @entity19 believes the key is " partly physical , partly psychological			1
" " people tend to breathe in , so their center of gravity changes			0
you should breathe out gently when you putt -- it works , " he says			0
so plenty of good advice : keep focused , and do n't get ahead of yourself -- it 's a pity sometimes that the professionals do n't take it			2
@entity102 @entity147 missed a putt of less than two feet to win the 1970 @entity10 at @entity149 , losing in a playoff to @entity151			0
" do i ever think about the putt ? " he said 35 years later			0
" only every four or five minutes ! " to escape such nightmares , the long putter seems the obvious refuge as it adds stability to the stroke , with the club anchored under a golfer 's belly			0
it worked to brilliant effect for @entity163 , who became the first professional to win a major with it earlier this year , but @entity101 believes that golfers who switch will make only temporary gains			2
better , perhaps , to adopt the attitude of the great @entity6 golfer @entity170 , who often performed miracles around the greens			0
" the more i practice , the luckier i get , " the nine - time major champion was once famously quoted as saying			2
so for the high - handicapper , the message is that hours of practice makes perfect			1
non-golfers can take this tip from @entity19 and apply it to a host of everyday tasks : " seeing and feeling and performing a skill in your mind 's eye , using your imagination to rehearse and practice it to perfection			1
" the question is : do you have the dedication to achieve your goals whether on or off the course ?			0

putting is a skill that can be mastered by anyone , experts tell @entity0
practice really does make perfect , says @entity198 professor @entity19
research shows there can be *transferable* skills to other walks of life
biggest challenge is keeping focused away from an outcome , psychologist says
