-- the devastating wall of water that struck @entity5 in march was the result of at least two waves that combined to create a more powerful tsunami , @entity2 scientists said monday			1
ocean ridges and mountain ranges below the surface of the water channeled the waves created by the 9.0 magnitude earthquake off the coast of @entity5 , bringing them together far out at sea to form a " merging tsunami , " according to researchers from @entity19 and @entity20			1
the earthquake and tsunami together killed 15,840 people , according to the most recent death toll , and set off a nuclear crisis at the @entity27 plant			0
satellite data have enabled the researchers to come up with an account of the formation of the tsunami and its destructive force			2
" nobody had definitively observed a merging tsunami until now , " @entity33 , a research scientist at @entity19 's @entity34 in @entity35 , @entity36 , said in a statement			2
the results of the research could help predict the risks from tsunamis in the future			0
" we can use what we learned to make better forecasts of tsunami danger in specific coastal regions anywhere in the world , " said professor @entity45 of @entity20 .			0
