mention of @entity1 usually prompts images of tall buildings , pristine beaches and luxurious hotels			1
not graffiti , that 's for sure			2
so it seems an anomaly , perhaps , that the city should be host to the first gallery in the @entity12 , and possibly the @entity13 , dedicated to the art of the spray can			1
not so says @entity16 , partner in the groundbreaking venture , @entity18 , in one of @entity1 's more salubrious suburbs			1
the @entity21 -- smart , handsome , well educated -- is , in some ways , an unlikely champion of such a polarizing genre			0
he 's the kind of upstanding citizen you might expect to revile youths armed with spray cans			1
he says the art form goes way beyond graffiti , however			0
his gallery in @entity1 's @entity33 neighborhood appears to support his theory , offering spray - painted works an unlikely home in a country largely devoid of graffiti -- and attracting healthy prices			1
work at recent exhibitions has been fetching up to and upward of $ 10,000			0
shared passion at any one time there are about 100 pieces on show with exhibitions changing at least once a month			0
@entity47 , 43 , and fellow founder and curator @entity46 , 45 , knew there would be demand after their shared passion for street art led them to a surprising discovery in the @entity56			2
" we realized when we were going to gallery openings here in @entity1 that we could n't really see what we enjoyed and when we found it , it was quite overpriced , " says @entity16			1
" then we were talking to galleries in @entity64 and @entity65 and @entity21 and those guys were telling us that people from @entity1 came over there to buy artworks			2
" this made us think : ' why not open a gallery ... people who are interested in this cross the @entity73 so it proves there is demand			2
' " it was still a gamble because it is hard to do a market study , but the feedback as soon as we opened was absolutely amazing			0
" first show , " @entity1 , " celebrated a @entity64 district where street artists are free to spray - paint without hassle from police			1
" it 's a very creative place			2
there 's a big street artist community there and during our last trip we met lots of artists and signed 10 , male and female , from @entity64 , some from @entity65 and @entity96			1
that exhibition was a sneak preview of their work			0
" the gallery 's third exhibition , " be the change , " was certainly a departure from what @entity1 's healthy , but largely commercial art scene was used to			1
it celebrated some of the more brash examples of street art and graffiti , with some work examining public protest			2
again , not something the @entity12 experiences too often			2
incendiary inspiration before long , big international names in the genre were getting involved			0
@entity120 veteran nasty brought signs and wall tiles from the @entity21 capital 's metro , decorated in his inimitable style			0
" nasty is very experienced and well known and began in the ' 80s by tagging trains , " says @entity16			0
" he has just had an exhibition in @entity130			0
" fellow @entity21 street star @entity131 -- who does everything from portraits to comic - style work -- flew in , as did @entity136 - based mural specialist @entity135 , who also comes from @entity21 but has created futuristic work inspired by @entity1			1
@entity139 - born , and now @entity1 - based , @entity138 brought possibly the most controversial work , inspired by incendiary street protest , in addition to a decorated chunk of wall that he has on permanent display in the gallery			1
by contrast , the gallery recently curated a special exhibition to compliment the holy month of @entity151			0
" @entity157 " matched street art with @entity154 writing , given a modern twist by local talent			0
" we took the opportunity of @entity151 to do something about the art of writing , " adds @entity16			0
" here in the region , @entity163 calligraphy is very important and is a real art form in itself			0
there is an evolution in this particular art. " on the other side the graffiti started with lettering , guys signing or tagging streets or trains			0
so it was interesting to mix those arts of writing , the classical but modern calligraphy with the writing in graffiti , a mix of ancient and modern			0
" and we managed to find some calligraphers that do much more modern pieces than we 're used to seeing in galleries around the region			0
some were very close to street art. " it proved an exciting glimpse into where @entity1 could go with the genre and flushed out some indigenous potential			1
" we would be very keen to display more local street artists , " adds @entity47 , when asked whether he plans to showcase and nurture some of that native talent			1
breaking down barriers a few of those artists mingle and exchange ideas during the gallery 's frequent and vibrant opening nights			1
" for the moment we are focusing on established artists , but a bit of what we do is to help the local scene and raise the level , " says @entity16			0
" it 's good to visit a gallery to meet experienced artists , to improve your style and work , and that 's what i believe is needed here			1
" street art is not allowed anywhere ( in the @entity12 ) , but it can be tolerated in western countries			1
here it is not really the case and we do n't want graffiti all over the place			0
" but one of our missions is to help the local guys and to make local culture and people from the region understand that street art is not about degradation and that there are many different styles in street art. " for now , @entity18 is opening its walls to the likes of @entity236 , @entity237 , @entity238 and @entity239 and is plotting a busy 2015 as its own exterior white walls are gradually replaced by visiting artists spraying what they think of @entity1 's new art hotspot			1
@entity18 is currently hosting one of the first and most infamous graffiti writers of the @entity247 movement			2
@entity64 's @entity248 is showcasing more than 100 of his works in @entity1 under the banner " @entity252 " until december 10			2
the artist is known for his massive walls and post-graffitism abstracts and the @entity1 show represents his biggest publicly displayed collection yet			2
