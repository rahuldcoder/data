-- at 81 , @entity1 is probably the world 's oldest signed model			0
just last month , the grandmother of two inked a contract with @entity7 models , the agency that represents @entity9 such as @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12			1
already this year , @entity14 - born @entity13 has bagged the front cover of @entity16			1
" can you imagine ? " she laughs over the phone from @entity20			0
" you know , i never dreamt this in my whole life ! " she also features in luxury store @entity27 ad campaign , styled by former @entity29 editor - in - chief @entity28 , alongside the likes of @entity31 and @entity32			1
in the past few weeks , she shot a fashion spread for @entity29 -- " @entity34 ... or @entity35 vogue , i ca n't remember " -- with photographer @entity37 , which will feature in the coming months			1
" ( it 's ) of me -- with all these 20 - year - olds he always photographs , " she says			1
not that she 's phased -- breaking the mould is nothing new for @entity13			1
@entity13 had started modelling in @entity45 in 1954 for @entity46 and @entity47 and claims to have been the highest paid catwalk model of her time			1
her big break came in 1958			0
@entity53 , who would later become known for designing first lady @entity55 's state wardrobe in the 1960s , spotted @entity13 in @entity45 and offered her a contract to come to @entity20 to model one of his collections			2
" the day i arrived i met @entity63 ( legendary fashion editor at @entity64 and @entity29 ) and she introduced me to ( @entity66 ) @entity65 , " remembers @entity13			1
she became @entity65 's muse , working with him exclusively for three years -- and in 1959 , @entity13 was the first @entity69 model to feature on the cover of a fashion magazine , gracing the front of @entity64 in an image shot by legendary photographer @entity65			1
it was the cover that almost was n't , although @entity13 did n't know that at the time			1
race and fashion : still an issue ? years later , @entity65 told her that the magazine 's publisher at the time , @entity80 said to him , " listen , we ca n't publish these pictures			1
the girl is not white			0
" @entity65 was due to renew his contract with the magazine , and said he would n't sign unless they published his photographs of @entity13			1
she says : " ( @entity65 ) had sort of blackmailed them into putting these pictures into the magazine			2
" @entity13 says she probably reached the height of her fame as a model in 1960			2
" i had , you know , tons of write - ups on me as being the most famous model ever , on the runway			0
" every advert that came out ( featuring @entity13 ) , it would say stupidly ' @entity102 ' on it			2
i felt like ... a circus ! " @entity13 says that her childhood in @entity102 -- when she was 16 , she and members of her family fled @entity14 during @entity110 -- had made her " such a practical person " and she found modelling " frivolous			2
" so @entity13 moved behind the camera			2
she took over as fashion editor at @entity64 in the early 60s when @entity63 left			2
" they took me as an offbeat character , " she recalls , but she stayed for 11 years , mainly working with @entity65			1
in the late 1980s , she was instrumental in the launch of @entity118 -- " a magazine for women over 45 , " she says -- at a time when magazines did n't talk to that readership			0
" we were way ahead of our time , " says @entity13			2
" we were 21 years ago			0
" the magazine won awards and built a readership , but folded after six years , the victim of an unclear vision , according to the @entity130			0
@entity13 's current new beginning started a couple of years ago when her daughter brought the then creative director of @entity137 fashion magazine , @entity135 over for dinner			1
" after dinner he said to me , ' i 'm going to do 20 pages on you			0
' and i thought , ' this guy is nuts ! i have n't been photographed in 20 years			1
" and since then , every month , i 'm in some magazine			0
it 's crazy , " she said			0
how a small - town girl became @entity102 's first supermodel @entity149 , head of @entity7 , who has overseen @entity13 joining the agency , says that despite her age her appeal is obvious			1
" @entity160 , she 's legendary , " he says , adding that she 's " this amazing woman who has given so much to the fashion industry ... and also , oh , by the way , she happens to be in her 80s			0
" how inspirational is that for any woman of any age ? " among other things , he 'd love to put her on the runway -- where she started over half a century ago			0
" @entity166 , how funny , how funny , how funny ! " she chuckles			0
" well , i 'm a great dancer so i 'm sure i 'm not so worried about going on a runway			0
" but , always practical , @entity13 says she 'd like , perhaps to be a spokesperson of some kind			2
she is , she claims , one of the few people who know the history of fashion , perhaps because she 's lived it			0
" we 're signing up for something that might be a little unusual , " she says , " for someone who might be interested in seeing that a woman can be active until this age and , you know , not look so bad without plastic surgery			0
