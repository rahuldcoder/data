march 14 is my favorite day to be a nerd			1
across the country , math geeks in museums , schools , private groups and elsewhere gather to celebrate the number pi , approximately 3.14			1
that 's why march 14 -- 3 - 14 -- is @entity9			1
what 's more , @entity10 was born on this day			1
a quick refresher : @entity13 is defined as the distance around a perfect circle , or the circumference , divided by the distance across it , or the diameter			1
it is also involved in calculating the area of a circle , the volume of a sphere , and many other mathematical formulas you might need in the sciences			2
throughout history , people have been captivated by this number because there is no way to calculate it exactly by a simple division on your calculator			0
what 's more , its digits go on infinitely , without any pattern in the numbers			0
3.1415926535897932 ... etc. even that many digits are more than most people would need for everyday use , but some folks have been inspired to memorize thousands of digits of pi , or even use the digits to create poetry or music			0
on @entity9 , one number ' reeks of mystery ' math may be scary , but pi is not -- as evidenced by the widespread revelry on @entity9			1
one might even say -- gasp ! -- it 's cool to like pi these days			0
even the @entity57 supported the designation of march 14 as @entity9 in 2009			1
in countries where the day is written before the month , friday is 14 - 3 , which looks less like pi			2
" and so @entity9 is an acquired taste , " mathematician @entity62 , at the @entity63 in @entity64 , said in an e-mail			1
conveniently , " pi " sounds like " pie , " and pies are round			0
you could celebrate @entity9 in a casual way by grabbing a slice of pastry , or pizza			1
if you 're in enrolled in school , your math class or math department might be doing something special already			2
but if you happen to live in a particularly pi - happy place , you might be able to take part in some larger - scale , pi - inspired activities			0
where @entity9 began if you want to go where the day is said to be " invented , " look no further than @entity84 's @entity83			1
@entity85 , who worked in the electronics group at the museum , began the tradition in 1988			0
last year was @entity9 's 25th anniversary there			1
@entity9 began as a small gathering with mostly museum staff			1
now it 's a public pi extravaganza featuring a " @entity95 , " whose attendees get a number -- 0 to 9 -- and line up in the order of pi 's digits : 3.14159265 ... you get the idea			0
the parade ends at the " pi shrine " -- a pi symbol with digits spiraling around it embedded in the sidewalk , which was unveiled last year			0
for those who ca n't attend in person , the @entity83 has a @entity111 event that includes " irrational exhibits , fireworks , cheerleaders , music , and dancing			1
" the museum also lists a bunch of educational activities to teach about the concept of pi			0
on @entity9 , is ' pi ' under attack ? where @entity10 lived on the opposite coast , the leafy university town where @entity10 spent the last 22 years of his life is showing community - wide exuberance for pi			1
@entity131 , @entity132 , kicks off @entity9 weekend on thursday night with a reading by physicist @entity134 , then heads into a full day of activities on friday , including a walking tour of @entity10 's neighborhood and a pizza pie - making contest			1
the pie - eating contest takes place at @entity142 's supermarket , while an @entity10 look - alike competition will match mustaches and wild gray hair at the @entity146			2
@entity13 fans who have been spending the last year memorizing digits can show off and compete at the library , where the winner among 7 - to 13 - year - olds can take home a cool pi - hundred ( that is , $ 314.15 )			2
the @entity154 of @entity131 will have an @entity10 birthday party			2
@entity156 , inventor of the @entity158 puzzle , will speak at the library as well			0
here are 10,000 digits of pi for you to memorize the " brainiac town " residents " love this event because it 's a way for them to celebrate how quirky they are , " said @entity163 , owner of the @entity164 , who started @entity166 in 2009			2
" a lot of them get super into it			0
" last year about 9,000 people participated , she said			0
along with her fascination with @entity10 , @entity163 was inspired to launch a town - wide @entity9 after she heard that the @entity179 mathematics department celebrates march 14 with pie - eating and pi - reciting ( as a @entity131 student , i got second place for most digits in 2005 and 2006 )			1
even more pi @entity186 is getting into the pi business too			0
lots of restaurants and bakeries are offering @entity9 specials			2
the @entity192 and @entity193 are hosting a 3.14 - mile walk / run friday night , with discounts for anyone named @entity10 , @entity197 or @entity198			1
@entity199 highlights two options for satisfying your pie cravings in the @entity203			0
@entity204 can head to @entity205 at @entity206 ( 3:14 p.m. ) for pi - themed activities such as " @entity208 at @entity209 on @entity210			0
" the @entity211 in @entity212 has educational @entity9 events , and the @entity214 will celebrate too			1
even the @entity215 in @entity216 , @entity217 , will celebrate the day , as " @entity218 loved the irrational numbers @entity13 and @entity220 , often using them and other mathematical principles in his art , " according to the museum			1
if you live in the area , check out their schedule of math - inspired films and tours throughout the day			0
there are plenty of online resources too , such as piday.org			0
outside of the physical classroom , @entity9 will be celebrated online through @entity235 's virtual classroom project			2
@entity236 , author of the comprehensive book " the @entity238 , " is hosting a @entity9 competition in which students from three classrooms will square off to see who can recite the most digits of pi from memory			2
how did @entity9 become such a big thing ? @entity236 says that @entity9 has become a hit for the same reason the new " @entity250 " tv show is getting so much attention			2
" people all around the world are hungry to make science and math fun and interesting , " he said in an e-mail			0
" we know math and science is important , we know that it 's fascinating , but we often do n't know how to make it fun and interesting			0
@entity9 gives us a great excuse to throw away our fear of math and say ' hey , it is kind of neat ! ' " if you agree , just wait until 3/14/15 -- or as one popular @entity264 group calls it , " the only @entity9 of our lives			1
" that 's because pi to four digits after the decimal is 3.1415 , and we 're unlikely to survive until 2115 to see that second instance of pi perfection			0
so get ready next year to take a picture of your digital clock on 3/14/15 at 9:26:53 a.m. that 'll be worth more than a thousand digits			0
follow @entity276 on @entity277 at @ lizlandau how do you celebrate @entity9 ? tell us in the comments .			1

math geeks and others celebrate @entity9 every march 14
@entity13 , or roughly 3.14 , is the ratio of circumference to diameter of a circle
the @entity9 *holiday* idea started at the @entity83 museum in @entity84
@entity10 was also born on march 14
