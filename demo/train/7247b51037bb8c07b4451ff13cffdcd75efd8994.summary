-- as @entity1 face an uncertain future without @entity3 , the world 's attention now turns to his youngest son , @entity6 , whom the ruling @entity7 has dubbed the " great successor			1
" " @entity6 's leadership provides a sure guarantee for creditably carrying to completion the revolutionary cause ... through generations , " the party said			1
but the younger @entity6 remains a mystery			1
even his age is uncertain to most of the outside world ; @entity6 is believed to be in his late 20s			2
the first formal mention of his name in official state communications came just over a year ago , in october 2010 , when he was promoted to the rank of four - star general just before a rare meeting of the country 's ruling party			1
@entity6 is said to have a fondness for @entity28 and basketball star @entity29			1
he is believed to have studied in @entity30 and is thought to have @entity32 , @entity33 and possibly @entity34 language skills			0
@entity35 , who went to school in @entity30 , believes @entity6 was one of his classmates between 1998 and 2001			2
" he was a normal guy like me , " interested in sports , movies and computers , @entity35 said last year			0
" he was competitive at sports			0
he did n't like to lose , like any of us			0
" @entity35 said his classmate played basketball and had basketball games on his playstation			0
" the whole world for him was just basketball all the time , " @entity35 said			0
@entity35 said he shared a desk with the @entity1			2
one day , @entity35 said , the young man , who went by the name @entity51 told his friend , " i am the son of the leader of @entity1			1
" @entity35 said he does n't know what to expect from @entity6 as a leader			2
" i can just say what i know : @entity6 , when he was 16 , he was a good guy , " @entity35 said			2
" so , i do n't think he would do something bad			0
but i do n't know what he 's been like in the last nine years			0
" at one point , @entity3 's eldest son , @entity59 , was considered the top candidate to succeed his father before he fell out of favor after he got caught trying to sneak a trip to @entity65 using a forged passport			1
in an interview with @entity70 's @entity69 last year , the oldest son said he opposed the " hereditary succession for three generations			2
" however , he added , " i would like my younger brother to do his best for the people of @entity1 and their true wealth			2
" a @entity0 analysis of more than 50 @entity79 diplomatic cables published by @entity80 suggest that @entity3 was always closest to his youngest son			1
one from 2009 cites the memoirs of the elder @entity6 's former @entity70 chef , @entity83 , who said the leader " adored @entity6 for resembling himself , both in image and in personality			1
" another analyst described @entity6 as " a bold and big - hearted person			1
" according to another cable from june 2009 , @entity6 emerged as the front - runner to succeed his father that year when he began working as acting chairman of the @entity92 " to support his ailing father " according to a cable from june that year			1
@entity96 observers noted at the time that " ' young master ' is a nickname that the great general has begun using for his third son			2
" but @entity6 is simply " not ready " to rule , said @entity101 , senior adviser at the @entity102 and an expert on @entity1			1
" this is the most opaque regime that is a nuclear weapons state , and now they have a leadership vacuum in which a kid is basically trying to run the country , " @entity101 said			0
" so it 's not a good situation at all			0
" his father began grooming him for the job only three years ago after suffering a stroke			0
in contrast , @entity3 himself was groomed over a period of 14 years before taking the reins from his father , @entity119 , in 1994			2
though @entity6 can boast an array of titles , it 's unclear whether he actually has any decision - making authority			1
" i think it 's premature to conclude that @entity6 will make all the shots , " said @entity124 , director of the @entity125 at the @entity126			1
" @entity6 is not going to be expected , nor is he qualified , to make tough decisions			1
but the party system is there , and the decision - making mechanism that has been established by @entity3 will continue			1
and therefore the succession process -- even in intermediate terms -- should be smooth , " @entity124 said			0
it is likely that @entity6 's uncle , @entity137 , will rule behind the scenes as @entity6 trains on the job , the global intelligence firm @entity135 said			1
@entity3 delayed choosing a successor from among his sons to avoid allowing anyone to build up their own support base independent of their father , @entity135 said in its analysis			0
in recent months , @entity6 was tied to the disastrous effort to revalue the @entity1 currency , @entity152 's @entity151 , an @entity153 analyst who has worked with the @entity79 @entity154 , as well as @entity96 and @entity70 militaries			1
that effort led to protests -- unusual for the closed country -- and food shortages as people took to bartering in absence of available currency			0
so now , the world waits to see where the young man may steer his country -- and how @entity1 will interact on the global stage in years to come			0
" no one has any idea of what comes next , " @entity101 said			0
" we are in unknown territory			0
" @entity0 's @entity171 , @entity172 , @entity173 , @entity174 and @entity175 contributed to this report .			0

new : @entity3 always favored his youngest son , according to 2009 @entity80 cables
new : he was acting @entity92 chair , according to another cable
he started his military career as a four - star general
@entity1 expert : it 's premature to conclude @entity6 will " make all the shots "
