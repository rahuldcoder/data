-- in a shaky videotape released tuesday , the couple who kidnapped @entity3 can be heard discussing how to operate their new camera as they zoom in to capture images of children in a playground			1
in another , taken some years later , @entity3 accompanies a parole agent who is searching their home as his wife , @entity3 , films the search , mere yards from the outbuildings where @entity19 is hidden			1
the videotapes were released tuesday by the @entity21 , @entity22 , district attorney 's office in response to media inquiries under open - records laws , and " to highlight the gravity and severity of the mistakes made " by law enforcement in the 18 years the @entity32 held @entity19 captive , during which time she gave birth to two children by @entity3			1
@entity19 and her children do not appear in the videos released tuesday			1
@entity19 was just 11 years old when she was abducted in 1991 from the street in front of her @entity39 , @entity22 , home by @entity3 , a convicted sex offender who had served 11 years for rape			1
despite the fact that as a parolee he was regularly visited by police , he and his wife held @entity19 and her daughters in a hidden compound of sheds and tarpaulins until 2009			2
last month , a judge sentenced @entity3 , 60 , to 431 years in prison after he pleaded guilty to one count of kidnapping and 12 counts of sexual assault			1
@entity3 , 55 , got 36 years to life in prison for her role in the crimes , including kidnapping and one count of rape by force			2
the couple had pleaded guilty in late april in @entity67			0
a statement from @entity19 , read by her mother at the sentencing hearing , called the @entity32 " evil " and described her kidnapping by them as a " sexual perversion			2
" in a statement accompanying the release of the videos , the @entity75 's office said it had decided to reveal " certain details of this horrific case " at the request of @entity19 's family " in hopes of improving the supervision and detection of sexual predators			1
" in one of the three videotapes , taken sometime between 1989 and 1993 , the @entity32 can be heard talking in low tones about how the autofocus and other features of the camera work			0
meanwhile , the jostled camera catches fleeting images of children playing in a playground some yards away -- then settles on a small girl playing in the sand as older girls gambol on a tire swing			0
then , @entity3 stands against a tree , and begins playing the guitar and singing while the camera pans to either side , pushing his face to the margins and centering on the children in the background			1
" you got me real good ? " he asks at one point while barely on camera			0
" yeah , " she responds , " i can see you really good			0
" another brief and inept video , apparently taken from a car in which the @entity32 are sitting , shows a girl getting onto a bicycle and people in a parking lot			0
the camera zooms in on the legs			0
@entity3 appears onscreen briefly , affecting a grin			0
the third clip , taken between 2000 and 2007 , was taken by @entity3 during a parole agent 's search of their home in @entity131 , @entity22			1
as the agent goes from room to room , @entity3 has little to say to his queries			2
but @entity3 does , and raises some non sequiturs of her own			0
" what does a parole agent do for his parolees ? " she asks at one point			1
" @entity145 , you can come to the office and we 'll discuss that at an appropriate time , " the parole agent responds			1
" right now i 'm doing a search , and i 'd really -- uh , if you 'll stay in this front room , then i do n't have to place you in restraints			0
" the agent 's face is blurred in the video clip , and a portion where his name is mentioned is edited out			2
the images of children 's faces also are blurred			0
@entity0 's @entity162 contributed to this report .			0

@entity75 's office : release is part of an effort to improve " detection of sexual predators "
