@entity0 -- the @entity2 has a message to @entity4 as it starts work wednesday : open more areas for drilling and we will create more jobs for the @entity11 people			1
" with the right policies in place at all levels of government , our industry stands ready to be the engine of economic growth and recovery this country needs in 2011 and well beyond , " said the industry group 's chief , @entity12 , in a speech tuesday			0
the institute commissioned a study that says if the government will sign off on a plan to open the @entity37 , portions of the @entity26 , the @entity27 and the @entity28 and @entity29 to oil and natural gas exploration and production , the industry can create 530,000 jobs by 2025			1
but critics of previous plans to open vast areas to drilling have disputed industry reports about job creation , citing increasing production of drilling equipment outside the @entity11 and a shortage of refineries in the @entity11 that could limit the amount of oil sold in the country			1
additionally , according to the @entity52 , oil companies are sitting on nearly 70 million acres of leases they are not drilling , and @entity55 's oil refineries are not operating at their capacity because demand is lower			1
" it 's hard to say they create jobs when you look at the oil spill in the @entity37 and see how they destroyed jobs , " said @entity58 , director of @entity59 at the @entity60			2
" we 've certainly seen in the @entity37 that when drilling offshore and things go wrong , they have a domino effect on the economy and the regions that depend on the other natural resources , " said @entity58			0
but @entity12 said he is concerned that if oil and gas companies can not drill in @entity11 territory or if that ability to drill is restricted , companies will take their infrastructure and jobs elsewhere			1
" we 've already seen some companies send their idled @entity37 rigs to waters off the coast of @entity87 and @entity55 -- and other companies are discussing plans to relocate their @entity37 rigs , " he said			0
@entity58 agreed that job creation is important but said the renewable energy industry will create jobs that have less potential for an environmental disaster			2
" the renewable energy industry is one of the fastest growing industry sectors and it can create jobs that keep us competitive in the world and that are much healthier for our country , " he said			2
@entity103 , a former oil and gas executive and current proponent of alternative energy , said that while he disagrees with much of the institute 's study , it did get one thing right			0
" @entity55 has an ever - increasing supply of natural gas and those reserves and development of untapped shale resources should be utilized to meet expanding energy needs , especially in power generation , " he said			0
@entity12 said the @entity117 is delaying the process of granting offshore leases for exploration and drilling , has placed large areas off limits and is slow to issue permits in areas where exploration and drilling are currently allowed			1
the @entity117 and the @entity130 dispute @entity12 's statement that they are slow to issue permits or that they are opposed to offshore drilling			1
in fact , according to the @entity117 , there are more than 42 million acres in the @entity29 that are leased and available for permitting			1
" we remain focused on raising the bar for safety and environmental protection in offshore drilling , while also continuing to take aggressive steps to strengthen the agency responsible for overseeing offshore energy production , " @entity117 spokeswoman @entity138 said			1
" @entity29 decisions will continue to be based on science , public input and an open and transparent process			0
" @entity152 spokeswoman @entity151 said there have been a significant number of shallow water permits approved and that they are accepting applications for deepwater permits			0
however , she said oil companies have not requested many deepwater permits since the moratorium was lifted in october			1
" there have only been two permits submitted for new deepwater wells since october 12 , one of those is for activity that had been allowed under the moratorium			0
that means that there is only one application for a new deepwater well , " said @entity151			0
at one time , the @entity175 administration was actively trying to increase the area available to oil and gas companies for exploration and drilling as part of a strategy to become less reliant on foreign energy			1
in march 2010 , president @entity175 and @entity11 @entity117 secretary @entity185 announced a plan to expand oil and gas development along the @entity29 and the @entity37			2
" by responsibly expanding conventional energy development and exploration here at home we can strengthen our energy security , create jobs and help rebuild our economy , " said @entity185			0
but the april 2010 explosion and subsequent spill at @entity198 's @entity197 in the @entity37 stopped those expansion plans			0
the @entity117 later issued a moratorium on deepwater drilling that lasted until october 12			1
there was no moratorium on shallow water drilling as it was deemed less risky			0
@entity12 said that incidents like the @entity198 spill are rare and the oil and gas industry is committed to improving safety , but said the oil and gas industry can work on improving safety , explore new resources and create jobs all at the same time			2
" more domestic production of oil and natural gas both onshore and offshore is critical to jobs for all @entity11 , a stronger economy ( and ) an enhanced energy security , " he said .			2

oil industry *promises* *hundreds* of *thousands* of jobs if @entity4 opens more areas to drilling
@entity52 says millions of acres are leased now and not being drilled
@entity117 says oil companies are *n't* applying for deepwater drilling now
