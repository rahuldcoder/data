-- the drama surrounding @entity2 and cover - up of $ 1.7 billion in losses resulted in the first arrests thursday			1
three former executives -- ex-chairman @entity7 , former executive vice president @entity8 , and @entity9 , a former auditor -- were arrested for filing fraudulent information on the company accounts in 2007 and 2008			1
four other outside financial advisers were also arrested for assisting with the fraud			2
the furor that followed the firing of former @entity2 ceo @entity16 in october and his subsequent turn as whistleblower on the decades - long cover - up , saw the stock value of the @entity23 camera and medical instruments maker drop more than 75 % at the height of the crisis			1
besides the charges in @entity23 , officials in the @entity27 and the @entity28 are investigating possible criminal wrongdoing			0
the company appointed an independent commission , led by a former @entity23 supreme court judge , who released a report in december saying , " the management was rotten to the core , and infected those around it			0
" who is @entity16 ? a foreign " salariman " for @entity2 , the @entity40 worked for 30 years at the company , starting as a sales assistant in its medical sales division and rising up the ranks to become executive managing director of its @entity48 operations in 2008			1
in april , he was tapped by outgoing president and ceo @entity7 to become the @entity23 company 's first foreign president , a rarity among @entity23 listed companies			1
only @entity56 , chairman of @entity58 , @entity59 , the head of @entity60 , and @entity61 of @entity62 currently lead @entity23 listed companies			0
according to @entity16 , things began to go awry internally when a @entity23 magazine , @entity64 , published an expose in july questioning exorbitant fees @entity2 paid consultants for a 2008 acquisition deal , and extravagant purchase prices of three small companies			1
@entity16 said that when he began asking @entity7 and @entity8 about the deal , he was stonewalled			1
tensions escalated until october 14 when at a board meeting @entity16 was fired by a unanimous vote			1
what was the cover - up ? according to a december 6 report issued by the third party set up by the company to investigate @entity16 's claims , the company had inflated fees for the 2008 purchase of @entity83 , a @entity28 medical instruments firm			2
the fees paid to advisers totaled $ 687 million , nearly one - third of the company 's purchase price			0
the panel also found the $ 773 million paid for three small @entity23 companies -- a face cream maker , a plastic container maker and a recycling business , each with fewer than 50 employees -- were exorbitantly priced to cover - up the company 's loses			0
the problems at @entity2 date back to @entity23 's booming 1980s , according to the report			0
after the 1985 @entity99 on currency , @entity23 's yen steeply appreciate in value			0
to offset the losses @entity23 corporations saw on the back of a rising yen , companies like @entity2 began dealing highly speculative securities , such as derivatives trading , the report said			2
by 1990 , the losses had mounted and a series of chief executives , ending with @entity7 , kept the losses secret			1
the losses were hidden through an intricate scheme that diverted cash through a @entity114 account			0
police in several countries are still investigating the transaction -- so far , no one has been arrested in the scheme			0
was the @entity23 mafia involved ? there have been some published reports that the @entity23 mafia may have been involved in helping to hide the assets			0
while criminal investigators may still examine that possibility , the independent committee report said it did not find any involvement of " antisocial forces " in its investigations			0
what 's next ? after his ouster , @entity16 talked to investigators in three continents , @entity23 legislators about improving corporate governance in the company , and campaigned to retake the helm of the company			2
@entity16 sought the resignation of the entire @entity2 board and new management for the company			1
the @entity2 board said it plans to step down , but not until after a special shareholder meeting expected in april to chart the new management direction of the company			2
in january , citing lack of support from @entity23 institutional investors , @entity16 abandoned his drive to return to the company , but said he plans to file suit for wrongful termination .			2
