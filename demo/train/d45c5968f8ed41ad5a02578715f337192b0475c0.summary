@entity0 -- if anything were to go seriously wrong at tuesday 's inauguration of @entity5 , homeland security secretary @entity2 is the man who would manage the crisis response			1
he is trying to make sure everything goes right			0
@entity5 's visit to @entity9 , @entity10 , on saturday offered a taste of tuesday 's tight security			1
" i do n't anticipate anything disruptive			0
part of my job is to hope for the best and plan for the worst , " @entity2 said during a final tour of key sites across @entity0			1
@entity1 exclusively accompanied @entity2 on the tour			1
@entity2 said authorities are not aware of any credible threat to the inauguration			1
" we are constantly scrubbing and rescrubbing intelligence to see if there is a threat that we should be concerned about			0
and that is going to continue , frankly , through the inauguration itself , " he said			2
" we are literally going to be watching this every minute between now and the conclusion of events on the 20th			1
" it is difficult to detect individuals or small groups intent on causing trouble , and @entity2 is most worried about them			1
" i am still focused on the kind of event we had at @entity40 : one disturbed person kills a bunch of people			0
so whether the motivation is racism or some psychological disorder ... in an open society , it is impossible to keep a single individual from doing some damage , " he said			0
@entity2 's first stop was the multi-agency command center from which he will monitor inaugural events			1
this is the security nerve center for the inauguration , with representatives of federal , state and local agencies that will help secure the swearing - in , the parade , the balls and other special events			1
" everyone has a common picture of what is going on , " @entity2 said			1
" if something arises , we know who has the ball			0
we know who plays a supporting role			0
if an issue that is not anticipated comes up , we are in the room ; we can figure out what do ; we can make a decision			0
" @entity2 also took a swing by the @entity77 , where @entity5 will be sworn in			1
the west side of the @entity77 gives a panoramic view of the @entity80 , where crowds will assemble to watch tuesday 's events			2
@entity2 said it was useful to see the setting firsthand			2
" you get a sense of the physical layout			0
you may get an idea of where the potential congestion areas or challenges are in terms of managing that large crowd , " he said			0
the presidential reviewing stand was still under construction in front of the @entity98			0
this is where @entity5 will view the parade in his honor			0
in the biting cold , @entity2 got a quick tour and received a briefing from the @entity105			1
turning up his , @entity2 expressed concern that the public will not plan and prepare for the weather , which is forecast to remain frigid			2
" the worst thing in the world would be for someone to come dressed like he is going to go to @entity112 , with no food or water or place to stay			0
" critics have accused inauguration organizers of engaging in security overkill , but @entity2 said he has tried to strike a balance			1
" you do n't want to make this like an armed camp , because it spoils the event itself			0
at the same time , you want to have enough capacity so you can deal with any foreseeable issue , " he said			0
unlike other @entity129 administration officials , @entity2 will not leave his job when @entity5 is sworn in			1
he will stay on until the morning of january 21 , to ensure continuity through this major security event and to allow his designated successor , @entity133 , to enjoy the festivities			2
@entity2 believes that this is the largest and most complex security event in history			1
an estimated 8,000 police officers will be on duty , along with almost a thousand @entity140 personnel , @entity142 screeners and others , including 10,000 @entity145 troops			0
@entity2 said that another 20,000 members of the @entity145 are being held in reserve			2
" i think we are ready , " @entity2 said .			2
