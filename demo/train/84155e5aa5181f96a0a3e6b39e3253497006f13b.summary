-- it may feel to us , in @entity3 , as if @entity4 has constantly been in the news since that fateful afternoon of may 14 , 2011 , when @entity7 officers arrested him on board an @entity11 flight bound to @entity12			1
the then - head of the @entity14 was due to meet @entity16 chancellor @entity15 to try to solve the euro crisis			0
the man the @entity3 like to call @entity4 has only spoken twice about the day he fell from grace , the day he risked a brilliant international career , like many others to play @entity24 roulette			1
the first time he talked publicly was in september 2011 on @entity3 television			2
now , almost two years later , he has given his first @entity29 language interview , on @entity0			1
the @entity3 were n't very tender with him the first time he spoke out ; they will undoubtedly be as severe the second time			1
@entity4 says how he still feels " very angry " at the @entity35 justice system for having paraded him , handcuffed , for the whole world to see , " at the precise time when a man should be considered innocent			1
" two years later , @entity4 still smarting over ' perp walk ' those images were , and indeed remain , shocking			2
it is illegal in @entity3 to show the face of people arrested by the police until they are proved guilty			2
it is , however , difficult to feel sorry for him now , especially after all that we have learnt since : his admission that he attended orgies in @entity3 with prostitutes paid for by friends , although he assures us he could not have possibly realized they were prostitutes because he only ever saw them naked			1
this man was going to be @entity3 's next president after five years of @entity55 rule			2
i would have voted for him , as no doubt millions of my compatriots would have done too , convinced as we were of his dazzling intelligence and that he was the man to resolve the euro crisis			0
we vaguely knew of his womanizing , certainly not a crime in @entity3 books , except we were n't aware it was pathological			1
@entity4 does n't however dwell too long on his @entity68 demise and swiftly moves on to explain how @entity69 is suffering a crisis of leadership			1
quoting an @entity73 proverb , he says that an army of lions led by a sheep will always be defeated by an army of sheep lead by a lion			0
does he unconsciously imply that he was the lion @entity69 could have had and badly needed to dig itself out of its financial quagmire , if only fate had n't decided otherwise ? possibly			0
meanwhile , the former head of the @entity14 blames the @entity69 institutions for failing to implement hard decisions and for dithering			0
he says that some @entity69 leaders are " perfectly up - to - date " and capable but that they are victims of deficient decision - making mechanisms at a supra - national level			0
would he give , as @entity3 has tried to convince a reluctant @entity16 since 2008 , more power to the @entity92 and its director @entity93 ? probably			2
as @entity97 , president of the @entity98 tweeted this week : " the @entity35 have one currency , one central bank and one government			0
@entity69 has one currency , one central bank and ... 17 governments ! it can not go on like this , " before adding : " we can not live with 17 individual policies on the euro			0
we need one single euro governance			0
" according to @entity4 , cohesion in decision making in @entity69 is not the only stumbling block			0
the @entity69 banking system is also at fault , " sick , " and needs reforming before growth can settle back in			0
reforming traders ' pay and bonuses is just but a small part of the problem , @entity4 says , what is even more important is to purge the whole system			2
when @entity4 first spoke to the @entity3 in september 2011 , he also dived into @entity69 economics to give a mini-lecture on how to go about the financial crisis			1
the @entity3 public reacted angrily : what was he doing , distilling his knowledge , when he was in no position to actually help the country any longer ? the @entity3 perfectly knew of his skills , so lamentably wasted ; they just did n't want to hear him anymore			1
the world will probably feel the same watching his interview with @entity0			1
@entity4 's voice does n't resonate anymore ; it was lost , once and for all , in a hotel suite in @entity134			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity137 .			0

@entity4 gives first @entity29 - language interview since arrest , on @entity0
@entity4 says he still feels " very angry " at @entity35 justice system for having paraded him
hard to feel sorry for him , @entity137 says , after his admission he attended orgies
@entity3 know of his skills , @entity148 *argues* ; they just did n't want to hear him anymore
