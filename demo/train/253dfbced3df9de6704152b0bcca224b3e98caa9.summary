-- @entity1 describes her first child , @entity2 , as a wedding gift			2
she also says it was her daughter who saved her life			2
@entity1 found a lump in her breast while she was breastfeeding			2
had she not been weaning @entity2 , she probably would n't have noticed that something was unusual with her breast , let alone have had it checked out			2
" when you 're in your 20s , you think you 're invincible , " she said			2
at first she thought she might have a clogged milk duct , but she went to the doctor anyway			2
what followed were mammograms , ultrasounds , biopsies and then the diagnosis : she had breast cancer			1
doctors told her other bad news : she had an 80 % to 90 % chance of being sterile after her treatment			1
she and her husband , @entity24 , really wanted another child			0
they were hoping for a son to carry on the family name			0
... it was a very hard pill to swallow , " @entity1 said			0
luckily , she found another option : an ongoing clinical trial designed to help preserve a woman 's fertility during chemotherapy			1
the study 's results were published friday at the @entity38 annual meeting in @entity40			1
hope in a trial since there would be about a month between surgery and chemotherapy , her doctor initially suggested that the couple seek fertility treatment			1
that way they could set aside embryos to be used later			0
the @entity52 thought about it , but the treatment 's $ 30,000 price tag was too much			1
they also struggled with what they felt was a moral dilemma of what they 'd do with the embryos they did n't use			0
ultimately , they decided that fertility treatments were n't for them			1
it 's a good thing , too : @entity1 later learned that she had hormone - negative cancer			1
the fertility drugs she would have needed for egg harvesting could have made her cancer worse			1
when @entity1 went in for her treatment at @entity71 in @entity72 , she learned about the clinical trial , which is funded largely by the @entity74			1
" honestly , i do n't know if my poor husband even had a vote in this			0
i saw it as my only hope , " she said			0
trial researchers wanted to know whether the drug goserelin ( brand name @entity83 ) could preserve the fertility of hormone - negative cancer patients			1
" it 's a drug that suppresses ovarian function or puts the ovaries at rest , " said the lead study author , dr. @entity86			1
@entity83 is normally prescribed to women with advanced hormone - positive breast cancer to put them into menopause and stop estrogen production , which can fuel cancer growth			1
studies have shown high rates of return of menstrual function , @entity86 says , but there have been no conclusive trials looking at ovarian function over the long term			0
a new approach the goal of the trial was to temporarily halt ovarian function and then assess it two years after treatment			1
" basically , if the ovaries are inactive , then they would hopefully be less sensitive to the chemotherapy effects , " said @entity86 , a breast cancer specialist at the @entity110			1
more than 200 women between the ages of 18 and 49 were recruited for the trial			1
all were given standard chemotherapy , but half added goserelin to their treatments			1
@entity1 was in the latter group			0
" i put my ovaries into menopause , without the chemotherapy doing it first , with the hope that ( the ovaries ) would wake up afterwards , " she said			0
she had to get an injection one week before starting chemotherapy and then once every four weeks as long as she was on chemo			0
" the drug is actually quite painful			1
it 's like a shooting a rice grain into your abdomen , " @entity1 said			0
@entity1 's chemotherapy lasted six months , finishing in september 2006			0
her menstrual cycle returned about four months later			0
" obviously , at that point , it does n't mean that you 're ovulating , and at that point , we were trying to figure out what to do next for our family , " @entity1 said			0
a life change two months later , she was laid off from her job			0
believing @entity2 would probably be their only child , the couple decided to open a preschool in @entity152 , " because if we ca n't have more children , then we 'll spend time with other parents ' children , " @entity1 sasaid			0
in late 2008 , they decided to see if they could get pregnant again			1
when @entity1 informed her doctors at @entity71 , they asked her to come in for more tests , particularly because triple - negative breast cancer has the highest recurrence rate five years after diagnosis			2
only 135 women ( including @entity1 ) met the criteria for ovarian function testing at the two - year mark , and among those patients , researchers found that 22 % of the women in the chemo - only group had premature ovarian failure , compared with 8 % in the group that also got goserelin			2
" that 's a two - thirds reduction , " @entity86 said			0
researchers also found that the women in the goserelin group were nearly twice as likely to have a successful pregnancy			2
@entity1 was one of them			0
she found out she was pregnant in february 2009 and believes she delivered the first baby in the goserelin group			2
@entity186 was born eight months later			0
11 myths fertility doctors hear then came @entity189 and finally baby @entity190			0
all told , among the 218 women enrolled in the trial , 22 patients in the goserelin group became pregnant , compared with 12 in the chemotherapy - only group			1
an important post-cancer issue " finding a simple and accessible way to protect fertility in young breast cancer patients while not harming cancer outcomes is an important issue , " said dr. @entity198 , deputy director of the @entity200 's @entity199 and one of the study 's co-authors			1
" i think this is convincing enough that we can use this standard practice " ( for women with hormone - negative breast cancer ) , @entity86 said			1
@entity71 breast cancer expert dr. @entity214 , who was not involved in the study , cautions that the study size was small			1
she says the research does show that it 's not harmful to take goserelin to preserve fertility			0
but she suggests " for patients who are sure they want to have children after chemotherapy , it is still imperative to meet with a reproductive endocrinologist to understand all their options and not just rely on goserelin			0
" more research needed although the study results are narrowly applicable to hormone - negative breast cancer , the concept may have broader applications in other cancers , said dr. @entity235 , president of the @entity38 and a breast cancer expert at @entity237 in @entity238			1
@entity86 agrees , saying that goserelin may also be applicable with cancers that are treated with similar chemotherapy drugs , like lymphoma , but that more research is needed			2
@entity1 is now almost nine years cancer - free			2
her message to other young women in a similar situation : be strong			2
it 's a hard road fighting cancer , she says , but do your research and consider participating in clinical trials that could help you and other women in the future			1
" to have the life you always hoped to have -- it 's a really huge thing , " she said			0
" it was definitely a painful experience , but the upside was my three sons , and i would do it again in a heartbeat			0
" @entity262 helps @entity263 overcome infertility stigma			0

treatments for cancer increase chances for a woman to become sterile
women who added one drug in trial were nearly twice as likely to get pregnant
@entity83 may be useful after treatment for other cancers , study author says
