native americans have been news in mainstream media recently , which is a rare occurrence			1
on wednesday , the @entity5 patent office canceled trademark registrations of the @entity8 team name , calling the word " disparaging to @entity0			1
" @entity10 , a @entity11 , was one of five plaintiffs to contest the federal trademark protection of the team name			2
this is a great victory for @entity0 and it 's indicative of the growing chorus of people who oppose the use of such racial slurs			1
last week , the @entity20 of @entity21 purchased airtime during the @entity23 to run the @entity25 video , " proud to be			2
" the ad , produced by the @entity27 , ran in seven major cities and aimed to visually illustrate who @entity0 are and who we are not			1
days after the ad aired during prime time , president @entity32 became only the fourth sitting president to visit an @entity35			2
meeting in @entity36 , @entity37 , the president and first lady addressed a diverse group of native americans : those dressed in traditional regalia ( not costumes ) and those in suits and ties and dresses and modern attire			1
they met with decorated veterans of wars past and present , and children with iphones and @entity55			2
these events are significant because @entity58 voices are often marginalized , ignored or simply left out of the @entity5 conversation			2
but the 21st century is a time when we are getting mainstream attention			1
we are reclaiming our voice and images			1
now , we are using platforms like social media to speak out against consistent appropriation of @entity69 culture or to collectively oppose offensive @entity58 imagery			1
recently , when " @entity72 " singer @entity71 wore a @entity58 headdress on the cover of @entity76 @entity75 , a # nothappy twitter campaign was launched			1
@entity71 quickly issued an apology			2
it was not the first time the use of a misappropriated headdress prompted a public mea culpa			2
in 2012 , @entity84 also issued an apology and removed a model wearing a headdress from its broadcast			2
now , more than ever , @entity0 are visible in ways they have not been in the past , erasing the antiquated image of a mythical , loin - cloth - clad @entity92 figure and giving voice to real @entity0			1
native americans : we 're not your mascots native americans are typically lumped into one large group due to the social construct of race and for ease			1
but @entity58 nations are diverse , and recent visibility in the news offers a chance to see a wider range of who we are			1
we are not " savages			0
" we are not " injuns , " and we are not " redskins			0
" we are the first people of this nation -- our old country -- and we have endured			0
we have always been here , and there is better chance you will see us and hear us			0
not all @entity58 nations operate casinos			0
we do not all get free tuition			0
we do n't get free gasoline , as @entity122 has suggested , and we do not all get monthly checks from @entity124			0
due to a complex history and interconnected issues , many tribes face poverty unlike other @entity5 ethnic groups and have the highest dropout rates			0
and sadly , there are additional reprehensible social statistics			0
but efforts like those the president outlined in his recent visit -- additional investment in tribal communities , improved communication between agencies and empowerment -- highlight some of the ways that the government is aiding these deeply rooted issues			0
and as @entity0 are seen beyond the stereotypes , and as we use our voices to speak out , we give visibility to who we are , as well as the issues we are working to solve			1
this visibility allows for a rehumanization			1
that is important , and not just for the sake of a brand name of a professional football team			0
it is also not about an overly sensitive , politically correct @entity58 adult who feels the sting of racial epithets			0
it 's about a future where our kids wo n't have to face the racism we have			0
our voices were once silenced , but we never stopped speaking			0
our land was taken , but we never stopped living			0
our children were stolen , and yet generations endure			0
the 21st century is incontrovertibly a time where we have reclaimed our voice from those who would speak on behalf of us , and it is a time where we work diligently to reclaim our appropriated image .			1
