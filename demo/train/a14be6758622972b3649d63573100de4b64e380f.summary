abductions have long been a source of conflict between the @entity49 , who have maintained tense relations since their 1950 - 53 conflict			2
the @entity2 war ended in an armistice , not a peace treaty , meaning the two sides are still technically at war			2

though most have been freed , the government says that the whereabouts of about 500 are unknown , he said			0

a report from the commission is due in march			0
one of those who testified was @entity108 , a @entity9 defector once worked for a @entity9 trading company that he said dealt with @entity110 and @entity2			1
that ended abruptly in 1999 , when he was arrested by government security agents , he said			0
" these people were beating me with clubs , and they said i should confess that i am a spy			0
' i 'm not a spy			0
' but they kept beating me -- for two weeks			0
" after undergoing " pigeon torture , " in which he was hung upside down with his hands cuffed behind his back , he confessed to what he told the commission he had never done			2
" i could not endure this any more so i confessed that i was given a spy 's job from @entity2 , " he said			0
" i had given up			0
" @entity108 said he was then taken to a political camp , where he spent three years before he was released to discover that his home was no longer where it had been , and he could not find his family			1

" i decided that i was done in @entity9			1
" after a year - long escape route that took him through @entity110 , @entity131 , @entity132 and @entity133 , @entity108 arrived in @entity2 in 2004 , where he has started a new life , but not forgotten the old one			0
