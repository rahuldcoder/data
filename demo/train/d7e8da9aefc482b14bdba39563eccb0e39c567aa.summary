-- when i heard that @entity2 and @entity3 are divorcing i was surprised at my own reaction , which was , honestly , sadness			1
i always thought they were an exciting couple -- both are passionate people who conquered a risky business , and each had a past that was just a little messy			2
@entity14 had three marriages before meeting @entity3 , two of which were to @entity16			1
@entity3 had one previous marriage , but was certainly the epitome of the " latin lover " in looks if not swagger			1
and yet they seemed deeply in love and stalwartly committed to each other over the years			1
i know -- they are a @entity27 marriage , which can be a minefield for marital stability			1
but for better or worse , these are also real people marrying with hopes of being together forever			2
because they are famous , we follow their lives through the tabloid or lifestyle magazines			2
they become part of our daily landscape and in a strange way as we become invested in their welfare			2
i realized as a read the story of their breakup that i wanted them to stay together -- forever			0
i wanted their private lives to have the " happily ever after " of their movies			0
i thought this pair had deeper roots and a deep enough connection to last for the long run			0
so , i think my sadness came from the recognition about how unrealistic i was			0
@entity27 marriages face special pressures that hurt their odds of lasting forever			1
but even if they were an average couple , the truth is that having made it to 18 or 20 years as they did , does not , in the slightest , guarantee you a sealed forever deal			1
marriages these days can fall apart at any stage of the relationship			1
the famously enduring marriage of @entity72 and @entity73 turns out to be more of an anomaly than a model			1
really , when you think of it , @entity72 and @entity76 were cast from a mold that was formed by a different generation and that mold appears to be broken			0
now , long marriages have no guarantees of continuance , even if they have lasted decades			2
just ask @entity85 and @entity86 ( 27 years ) or @entity87 and @entity88 ( 36 years )			2
in fact , the statistics tell us that the biggest percentage increase in divorces is among people over 50			0
so if you thought that getting older formed a protective bubble over your relationship , think again			0
@entity99 marriage is turning into a crapshoot for many people , especially @entity102			1
maybe holding on till " death do them part " is least likely for @entity27 stars whose work takes a hard toll on their relationships and whose exit from marriages is not generally impeded by financial concerns			1
but really , no marriage is immune against what seems to be an epidemic of marital unraveling			2
well , so be it			0
but we can do things that give us better odds of staying with our spouse			2
to me , that means we have to be intentional about our relationship every day , year , and decade we are together			0
we have to aim high , have a lot of fun , work hard at being each other 's lover and friend and always do everything we can to repair problems along the way			1
if it ends , it ends -- but it should n't die without having been given every chance to live			0
so , lets be realistic			0
you ca n't predict the future			0
i thought about this as i was looking at a photo of @entity2 and saw a huge tattoo on her arm that said " @entity144			1
" uh-oh -- i thought			0
if you yearn to have a name tattooed on your body , choose your mom 's or the name of your first pet			0
otherwise , take it from @entity2 , @entity144 and countless others : even long marriages have an uncertain future			1
i am not saying to plan for an exit while you are trying to make a solid entrance , i am just saying -- take care and have a @entity159			0
