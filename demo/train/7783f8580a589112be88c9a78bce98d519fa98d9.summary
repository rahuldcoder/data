-- the @entity1 is back ! retired from politics , @entity2 is taking a leaf out of his " @entity7 " buddy @entity5 's book and setting out to prove that he can still kick butt at 65			1
" @entity13 " represents his first starring role in eight years , and it seems there 's plenty more gas in his tank			1
the timing for a primed , pumped , itchy - trigger - finger shoot - em - up leaves something to be desired , no doubt , but with @entity18 unaccountably awol this january , @entity2 has the knucklehead r - rated action field pretty much to himself			2
what 's more , " @entity13 " brings it			2
if you park your brain outside , and double - park any misgivings about vicarious gun mayhem right alongside , it 's passable fun			0
it 's a modern - day @entity30 -- a souped - up and dumbed - down " @entity31 , " if you will -- with @entity2 making like @entity33 as border town sheriff @entity34 , the last man standing between a runaway bad guy ( @entity36 drug baron @entity35 ) and his freedom			1
charting a spectacularly erratic 24 - hour course , the movie juggles self - consciously hokey small - town comedy with slick ( or at least semi-slick ) high - tech chase scenes as the road - racing desperado leads @entity43 and the feds on a merry chase through the @entity46 in his prototype @entity48 01			2
the auto action seems a transparent pitch to sell high - end sports cars and inject a little momentum in a movie that 's equally content to dawdle over its morning coffee , shooting the breeze with amusing ( or at least semi-amusing ) supporting players like @entity34 's deputies , ornery @entity59 in the @entity61 role ) , bumbling @entity63 ( @entity62 ) , and sexy @entity65 ( @entity64 )			1
@entity66 gets unaccountably prominent billing for little more than an extended cameo as a guy named @entity70 , a screwy gun nut with a penchant for cavalier headgear			0
he 's excruciating , but almost puppy - like he 's so eager to please			0
the same might go for director @entity74 , a talented @entity75 known for macabre ghost stories like " @entity77 , " whacky adventures ( " @entity79 " ) , and grisly cop thrillers ( " @entity81 " )			1
his first @entity83 effort is full of bold , broad comic book strokes -- some of them pleasingly original , like a car chase through a cornfield , the husks of corn thudding against the windscreens like oversized bugs			1
listen to how he picks out the sound of a helmet rolling across the pavement			0
that 's a filmmaker alert to his environment and the tools at this command			0
but there 's just as much that 's ham - fisted or tin - eared			0
at best these are stereotypes we might recognize from other b flicks			0
there 's never a whiff of authenticity , except maybe when @entity112 appears for a cruelly brief bit part as a cranky local farmer			0
the uninspired score by @entity74 's countryman @entity116 does n't lift the so - so climactic shoot - out any , but the movie 's tongue in cheek humor will buy off most of the target audience			1
and @entity2 ? he 's indestructible .			2

movie is @entity2 's first starring role in eight years
he plays border town sheriff @entity34
it 's the first @entity83 effort for director @entity74
