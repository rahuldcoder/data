-- @entity2 's unsuccessful spell at @entity3 came to an end last summer when he was sold to @entity5			0
the winger is now flourishing in @entity7 and carried over his form to the international stage saturday as he led the @entity10 to a 3 - 1 win over @entity12 in the first leg of their playoff tie			1
he played a role in all three goals in @entity18 , earning a penalty that @entity20 converted in the fifth minute			0
his good ball led to an own goal in the 14th minute and he assisted on @entity24 's effort that made it 3 - 0 in the 50th			1
but @entity27 's goal deep into injury time left @entity12 with slight hope of appearing at the @entity30 for the first time since bursting onto the scene in 2002			1
@entity12 , however , wo n't have full home - field advantage in the return leg , playing next month 's match in @entity36 because of a stadium ban in @entity38			1
the ban was imposed after an @entity41 qualifier between @entity12 and the @entity10 last year was cut short due to crowd trouble			1
the winner of the tie earns a place at next year 's @entity30 in @entity46 and the @entity10 -- which lined up in @entity47 in 2006 and @entity48 in 2010 -- will be expected to complete the job			2
there was controversy in the other @entity53 playoff contested saturday			2
@entity54 , which has never featured at the @entity30 , converted a late penalty to edge visitor @entity57 3 - 2			1
to the disbelief of the @entity61 , @entity59 referee @entity58 awarded the spot kick for @entity64 's handball , which did n't appear to be deliberate			0
@entity61 players protested but the call stood and @entity67 © -- who missed a penalty in the first half -- broke the deadlock in the 86th minute			0
@entity57 had twice come back in @entity72			2
on sunday , @entity73 hosts @entity74 and @entity75 entertains @entity76			0
@entity77 visits @entity78 on tuesday .			0

@entity10 beats @entity12 3 - 1 in the first leg of their *football* playoff in @entity48
@entity27 's goal well into injury time gives @entity12 some hope in the return leg
the second leg will be played in @entity36 because of a stadium ban in @entity12
@entity54 edged @entity57 3 - 2 in the other playoff first leg contested saturday
