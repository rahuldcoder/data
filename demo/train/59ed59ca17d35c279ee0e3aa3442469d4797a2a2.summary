-- @entity2 's team principal @entity1 has insisted there is no " political intention " in the @entity7 marque 's decision to bear the country 's naval flag on their cars at the @entity12 @entity11			1
both @entity13 and @entity14 will carry the symbol on their livery , a move that has been interpreted as a message of support for two @entity7 navy officers arrested after an incident that resulted in the death of two @entity12 fishermen in february			1
the officers are understood to have mistaken the fisherman for pirates who they thought were trying to attack an oil tanker they had been protecting			2
they were jailed in march and later bailed ahead of their trial			0
@entity2 posted a statement on their website on wednesday that read : " @entity2 will carry the flag of the @entity35 on the cars driven by @entity13 and @entity14 in this weekend 's @entity37			1
" in doing so , @entity2 pays tribute to one of the outstanding entities of our country , also in the hope that the @entity12 and @entity7 authorities will soon find a solution to the situation currently involving two sailors from the @entity35			1
" @entity2 's decision to bear the flag on their cars was applauded by @entity7 's minister for foreign affairs , @entity51 , who took it as a show of support for the sailors -- @entity55 and @entity56			1
he wrote on his official @entity58 page : " congratulations to @entity2 for displaying the the @entity35 's symbol at the @entity12 gp			1
it will show the sailors the whole country is behind them			0
" @entity65 's governing body , the @entity64 , states clearly that it " shall refrain from manifesting racial , political or religious discrimination in the course of its activities and from taking any action in this respect			0
" but when questioned about the flag at a press conference ahead of sunday 's race in @entity75 , @entity1 was coy about the reasons behind it			1
" i think that you have to refer to that ( @entity2 's statement ) to be honest , and look what is written exactly , and the reason why we put that on , " he said in quotes carried on the sport 's official website			1
" there 's not any political intention or discussion in that			0
if you look at that , that 's really what is written			0
" if you look behind in the past we 've done a lot of initiatives but there 's nothing that i want to go into very specifically because it 's not really the place where i should do it			0
" @entity102 reported that @entity65 supremo @entity103 had said the matter should be dealt with by @entity12 's national motorsport association , the @entity105 ( @entity105 )			2
" what we 'd do , we 'd look at the national sporting authority ( @entity105 ) here to have a look at that ... we are not political , " @entity103 was reported to have said in @entity75			1
as for matters on the track , both @entity2 drivers trail behind reigning world champion @entity113 , who was quickest in both the morning and afternoon sessions			1
@entity117 's @entity116 driver sits six points ahead of @entity13 at the top of the drivers ' championship standings , as he goes in search of a third straight title			0
@entity113 and teammate @entity124 were over half a second quicker than @entity13 in the second practice session with @entity127 fourth fastest for @entity128			2
qualifying is on saturday before the race on sunday			0
" the track improvement was quite big today , it was dusty to start and improved lap by lap , so i would n't be surprised if tomorrow the order is different , but we 've had worse fridays , so i am happy , " @entity113 told @entity65 's official website			2
@entity13 , who has seen his championship lead eroded by @entity113 in recent weeks , added : " this is an interesting circuit : after the longest straight , there 's a combination of high - speed corners which are very nice to drive			2
" today the track was still very dirty , which is usually the case at new tracks that are n't used very often			0
tomorrow , when it will deliver more grip , it will be even more fun			0
