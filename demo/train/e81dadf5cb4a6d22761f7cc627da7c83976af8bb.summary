@entity0 has accused the @entity1 of " hypocrisy " and " double standards " following its decision to charge five @entity0 army officers with cybertheft against major @entity1 businesses			1
the @entity8 in @entity9 even took the step of summoning @entity1 ambassador @entity11 late monday , the state - run @entity13 news agency reported , as tensions between the two countries threatened to escalate into a full - scale diplomatic incident			1
earlier monday , @entity1 attorney general @entity18 announced that the men , all members of the @entity27 ( @entity27 ) , " maintained unauthorized access to victim computers to steal information from these entities that would be useful " to the victims ' competitors in @entity0			1
@entity18 said some of the " victims " included @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 , the @entity34 and @entity35			1
in an unusual move , the men were named in the indictment document as @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 and @entity43			0
these are the first charges against @entity0 state officials for what the @entity1 says is a widespread problem , @entity1 officials told @entity49 before @entity18 's remarks			1
but in a written statement tuesday , @entity0 's @entity8 said " it is widely known that the @entity1 has for a long time been using its advanced technology and infrastructure to perpetrate large scale theft of secrets and eavesdropping against foreign political leaders , enterprises and individuals			1
" from @entity63 to the ( @entity66 ) @entity65 incident , the @entity1 hypocrisy and double standards have been abundantly clear			2
the @entity0 @entity27 has been a serious victim of this kind of behavior from the @entity1 statistics show that in recent years the @entity27 's international internet terminals have suffered a large number of attacks			1
ip addresses show that a large number of those attacks come from the @entity1 " @entity0 demands that the @entity1 give a clear explanation of its internet theft of secrets and eavesdropping on @entity0 and immediately cease such activities			1
" on monday , @entity83 spokesperson , @entity82 , said the charges against its army officers were based on " intentionally - fabricated facts " that " grossly violate the basic norms governing international relations , " and urged @entity90 to " immediately correct its mistakes and withdraw the indictments			1
" @entity82 also revealed @entity0 would be suspending its involvement in the joint @entity0 - @entity94 , set up in april last year to work on measures to address cybersecurity -- an issue that has driven a wedge between the two governments in the past			1
what we know about the @entity0 army 's alleged cyber spying unit president 's concern at a regular news briefing at the @entity109 , press secretary @entity107 was asked about monday 's developments			2
" this is an issue that has been brought up by president @entity113 with ( @entity0 ) president @entity114 ( @entity115 ) in their meetings as recently as in march as a general problem that we have seen and reflects the president 's overall concern about cybersecurity , " @entity107 said			2
" we have consistently and candidly raised these concerns with the @entity0 government , and today 's announcement reflects our growing concern that this @entity0 behavior has continued			2
" he was adamant that the @entity1 " intelligence programs serve a specific national security mission , and that does not include providing a competitive advantage to @entity1 companies or @entity1 economic interests , " @entity107 said			2
" in other words , we do not do what those @entity0 nationals were indicted for earlier today			0
" a spokeswoman for the @entity138 told reporters that @entity90 wants to have more dialogue with @entity9 about the issue			0
" we remain deeply concerned about @entity0 government - sponsored , cyber-enabled theft of trade secrets and other sensitive business information for commercial gain , " @entity142 said			2
" and , again , this was specific to the actions of ... of just a few individuals			0
and we hope that the @entity0 government can understand that			0
" impacts real people this was a law enforcement case , she added , not a diplomatic one			0
" we continue to believe -- and this is relevant to us , our role here at the @entity138 -- that we can have a constructive and productive relationship with @entity0 , " she said			0
" we 're ready to work with @entity0 to prevent these types of activities from continuing			0
" joining @entity18 , @entity163 , @entity1 attorney for the @entity164 , said the alleged hacking has caused the victimized @entity1 companies to lose capital investments in research and technology			1
he added that the " important message " is that cyberespionage " impacts real people in real and painful ways , " he said			0
" the lifeblood of any organization is the people who work , strive and sweat for it			0
when these cyberintrusions occur , production slows , plants close , workers get laid off and lose their homes , " @entity163 said			0
" @entity181 , spying and cybertheft for commercial advantage can and will be prosecuted criminally even when the defendants are state actors , " he said .			0
