@entity0 call it a brief intermission : there 's a three - week break in the action after a slew of primaries in may and june and a couple big headlines			2
the major story line so far this election cycle is the ongoing battle that pits mainstream @entity12 against tea party groups and anti-establishment organizations			1
after a few high - profile @entity13 victories in late may and early june put to bed premature stories of the death of the 5 - year - old grass - roots conservative movement , incumbents and establishment candidates ran the table in last week 's contests			1
complete coverage : 2014 midterm elections the calendar ahead does n't look as promising for outsiders looking to knock off another incumbent in the remaining primaries in the 18 states yet to vote			1
" the primaries produced only a few fights between the tea party and the establishment wing of the @entity12 because many congressional republicans took their primaries seriously and kept their votes consistently conservative , " @entity12 consultant @entity32 told @entity1			1
" the few primary battles we saw produced victories based on combinations of intensity , fund - raising and motivating voters one way or another , " said @entity32 , who has been a top strategist and adviser to @entity42 and @entity43 @entity12 leaders			1
the resounding defeat of @entity42 majority leader @entity54 in his congressional primary in @entity56 to a little - known and underfunded anti-establishment candidate rocked the @entity12			1
but two weeks later , the tea party lost out on a golden opportunity to oust a sitting @entity12 lawmaker when sen. @entity61 of @entity62 edged out state sen. @entity63 in a primary runoff			1
@entity63 , who enjoyed strong support from tea party and anti-establishment groups , narrowly edged out @entity61 in the june 3 primary , but with neither man cracking 50 % ( there was a third @entity12 candidate on the ballot who grabbed 1.5 % of the vote ) , the contest moved to last week 's runoff , which @entity61 won by fewer than 7,000 votes			1
would @entity61 's strategy work elsewhere ? the senator 's victory was aided by votes from @entity82 , who were courted during the runoff campaign by @entity86 forces			0
but @entity63 alleges his team has found voting irregularities and is not conceding			0
" interpreting the @entity61 win as some kind of ' @entity92 ' moment is an overreach , " @entity12 communications strategist @entity89 told @entity1			1
" @entity12 leaders and their establishment backers dodged a bullet in @entity62 , but there is still a deep and active discontent among the grass roots , and it will only continue to manifest until the leadership reconnects with its base			1
anyone who seriously thinks otherwise is delusional , " said @entity89 , a senior vice president at @entity102 , a @entity0 public relations firm that has had many conservative clients			0
some victories but a lot of defeats anti-establishment forces have scored some victories this season			0
they knocked off another @entity12 incumbent , 91 - year - old rep. @entity112 of @entity113 , who lost his congressional primary runoff last month to a tea party - backed candidate			1
and in may , tea party - backed @entity117 came out on top in @entity121 's @entity43 primary			1
the same night conservative @entity123 , who was supported by anti-establishment groups , won the @entity12 contest in @entity56 's 2nd @entity127			1
but those were the major highlights for the tea party in a year when mainstream republicans have enjoyed most of the victories			2
primary challenges from the right shook up the @entity12 in the last two election cycles			1
but they have also hurt the party 's chances of winning back control of the @entity43 from @entity82 , effectively costing the @entity12 five potentially winnable elections since 2010			1
so what 's happening this cycle ? " @entity145 and incumbents have learned to run against tea party - backed candidates , " said @entity142 , senior editor for the nonpartisan @entity143 , a top campaign handicapper			1
and outside help is making a difference			0
" i think the @entity12 establishment is fighting back more than in previous cycles			1
there is more organization and involvement from outside groups in some of these primaries , " said @entity154 , deputy editor of the nonpartisan @entity155			2
" i think in the past it was too often an incumbent running against an anti-establishment challenger and a host of outside groups , " inside politics : the @entity168 's next target the battles ahead anti-establishment forces still have an outside chance to score an upset in @entity173 and @entity174 in early august			0
" for those folks who are looking to knock off a @entity12 senator in a primary this cycle , the opportunities are down to @entity173 and @entity174 , " @entity154 said			1
" there is still some time for those races to develop , but they will both take work to get the challenger campaigns to the same level as @entity63 in @entity62			2
" two - term sen. @entity186 of @entity173 is an inviting target			0
he 's known as a lawmaker willing to work with @entity82 to broker bipartisan deals			0
he 's facing off against a bunch of primary challengers			2
the one with the best shot of toppling @entity186 appears to be state lawmaker @entity194			0
" make no mistake about it -- the fight that @entity63 started in @entity62 will continue here in @entity173 , " @entity194 said after the @entity62 runoff			2
but unlike @entity63 , polls indicate @entity194 's the distinct underdog to @entity186			2
in @entity174 , sen. @entity202 is seeking a fourth term in office			0
@entity205 -- a second cousin ( once removed ) of president @entity206 -- touts himself as a conservative activist with the guts to stand up to the @entity12 establishment			1
@entity205 's campaign has tried to portray @entity202 as more about @entity0 than @entity174 , pointing to reports this year that the senator listed his voting address at the home of two longtime political supporters who rent out a room to him			0
@entity202 owns a rental property in his hometown of @entity220 and a home in the @entity0 suburbs , where he spends much of his time			0
but @entity205 , a radiologist , came under attack over old @entity226 postings in which he exposed private patient x-rays and other personal information -- poking fun at the dead or wounded			0
@entity205 was forced to admit he made " insensitive " comments			0
like @entity194 , polls indicate @entity205 trails far behind @entity202			2
but @entity232 , chief strategist for the @entity232 , a national tea party group that backs @entity205 , told @entity1 that the challenger is " able to bring a lot of excitement and enthusiasm among the grass roots			2
and that 's the problem @entity202 has			0
he 's pretty much out of touch with the people of @entity174			0
so i think that that frustration with @entity0 has manifested itself in growing support for @entity205			0
" winning by losing ? the next high - profile primary is @entity248 's @entity43 runoff on july 22 , but the tea party does n't appear to be much of a factor there			1
businessman @entity252 and rep. @entity253 advanced to a runoff , but the three more conservative candidates did n't			0
but regardless of the outcome of the primary contests , tea party leaders said they 've changed the conversation in @entity0			2
" the tea party is winning by losing in the sense that you do n't see any republicans saying , ' let 's pass immigration reform that gives a path to citizenship			0
let 's make it easier for the president to raise the debt ceiling			0
' almost all @entity12 have shifted right , " said @entity272 , @entity1 's chief national correspondent			2
another strategist said this year 's contests are n't the final chapter in the struggle between the grass roots and the establishment			0
" the party remains deeply divided , and both sides have the resources and commitment needed to take the fight into 2015 and 2016 , " wrote @entity155 , editor and publisher of the @entity155			0
" the war is likely to get messier and the division more consequential before the two sides look for ways to bridge their differences			0
" what does that mean for november ? the candidates who emerge from this year 's primaries could have an immediate impact come november			2
@entity82 have a 55 - 45 majority in the @entity43 ( 53 @entity82 and two independents who caucus with the party )			1
but in the midterm elections , the party is defending 21 of the 36 seats up for grabs , with half of those @entity306 - held seats in red or purple states			0
in the @entity42 , the @entity82 need to pick up a challenging 17 @entity12 - held seats to win back the majority from the @entity12			1
" we learned that @entity12 across the board have picked highly electable candidates and have improved their chances of taking over the @entity43 , " said @entity32 , the @entity12 consultant			1
but @entity82 disagree , and say that even though mainstream @entity12 are winning in the primaries , those candidates are moving further to the right to secure victories , which will likely hurt them when they face a more moderate general election electorate in november .			1

outsiders *vs.* insiders is the *dominant* story line in @entity12 primaries so far
after knocking off @entity54 , insurgents thought they had a sure win in @entity62
two more @entity12 @entity43 incumbents face challengers but hold lead in polls
establishment @entity12 fear a tilt too far right may hurt party in november
