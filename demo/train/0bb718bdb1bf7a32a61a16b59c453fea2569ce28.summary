-- coming out of the closets of our culture seems to be the thing to do these days , but it is not a new phenomenon			2
in the inaugural issue of @entity11 magazine in 1972 , dozens of @entity8 women signed a statement declaring " we have had abortions , " even though abortion was still mostly illegal in the @entity8			1
celebrity names dotted the listâ € ” @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20 among them			2
this consciousness - raising maneuver played a key role in changing public attitudes toward abortion			2
it contributed to what legal scholars @entity26 and @entity28 call the " successive waves of arguments " that " prompted growing public support for liberalizing access to abortion			0
" a year later , the @entity36 @entity35 decision decriminalized most abortions			0
in 1978 , former first lady @entity38 entered the @entity40 's @entity39 , and publicly admitted her own alcohol and drug dependency			1
in 1982 , she became founding director of the @entity44 for the treatment of drug and alcohol abuse			0
while many remained silent , celebrities @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity51 all chose to openly share their experience at the center			1
at a 1991 press conference , @entity56 megastar @entity55 announced that he had tested positive for @entity58			0
he retired from basketball and subsequently served as a public voice for hiv - aids education , prevention and anti-discrimination efforts			0
opinion : @entity66 's choice carries risks along with benefits last month , @entity56 player @entity69 announced that he is gay			1
while he justly deserves praise for an action that puts him among the first active @entity8 athletes in any of the four major professional team sports to publicly so identify , it has also been widely noted that he is far from early or alone in the coming out ranks of major athletes			1
celebrity names already dot that list too -- @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 and former @entity83 player @entity82 among them			0
tuesday , @entity66 made public the fact that she elected to undergo a double mastectomy , at the age of 37			1
this was her attempt to lower her risk of breast cancer , given the fact that she carries " the breast cancer gene			1
" she hopes to encourage other women to consider the potentially life - saving procedure for themselves			2
no doubt , other women will now come forward			0
a new list of celebrity names will coalesce			0
what is particularly remarkable about the public statement made by @entity66 is that she is a young , beautiful , sex symbol			1
she risks her career by changing her image in this way			0
to medicalize her breasts in the public 's perception is potentially to de-sexualize them			2
the bodily care of cancer prevention is far from the glamorous dream world that @entity115 sells			2
clearly , @entity66 has chosen the high moral ground of trying to save lives by publicizing the procedure and stating that she feels as beautiful as ever			1
we should be grateful for her straightforward and courageous statement			0
indeed , we should be grateful for all -- celebrities or not -- who have driven social change by publicly outing themselves			1
it is arguable that we might not have had as much support for abortion reform , or addiction treatment , or @entity129 , or marriage equality , without them			0
destigmatizing cancer prevention surgery will happen more quickly if celebrities and others get publicly vocal about their personal health choices			1
@entity136 : i feel empowered , supported in cancer fight importantly , abortion and addiction and @entity129 and love are different issues from preventative mastectomy			1
abortion is a difficult but fundamentally ordinary choice in an untenable situation			0
addiction is a disease that is relatively well understood , even if it is still difficult to treat			0
@entity129 is a global pandemic that is by now well known			0
marriage equality is a function of health and happiness in the first place			0
but the phenomenon of breast cancer still eludes scientists			1
we still do not know how to prevent it or reliably cure it , save perhaps by surgically removing a vulnerable organ			0
furthermore , it seems that a lot of our current ideas about it are not even correct			0
while the public receives the message that getting regular mammograms is an effective preventive strategy , it has recently been reported that such screenings turn out to be only minimally effective in lowering the morbidity of the disease			2
as @entity175 wrote in the @entity176 , our war against cancer has been a " feel - good war			2
" in fact , given the incidence of false positives , and of cancers that do not actually need to be treated , such screenings can cause harm			0
according to a survey of 30 years of screening published in the @entity196 in november 2012 , as cited by @entity197 , " mammography 's impact is decidedly mixed : it does reduce , by a small percentage , the number of women who are told they have late - stage cancer , but it is far more likely to result in over diagnosis and unnecessary treatment , including surgery , weeks of radiation and potentially toxic drugs			1
" when a celebrity such as @entity66 makes such a generous and powerful intervention , it is right for the world to pay attention			1
but the list needs to grow longer , as well , of those demanding greatly increased support for primary cancer research and stricter environmental controls on the toxic substances we eat and breathe			2
cancer needs a social movement demanding change			1
otherwise , no matter how many celebrities and others come courageously forward , and how well the world adapts to preventive mastectomy , it will not be enough			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity220 .			1

@entity220 : @entity66 deserves credit for *disclosing* her preventive mastectomy
she says @entity66 joins *tradition* of celebrities whose openness has *improved* life in @entity8
@entity220 : there 's much we do *n't* know about breast cancer ; a movement for change is needed
