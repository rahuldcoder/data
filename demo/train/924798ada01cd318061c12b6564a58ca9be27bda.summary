@entity0 -- a @entity3 employee who resigned last month in protest over @entity6 's war in @entity7 said friday he has received an outpouring of support from @entity7 - @entity6 and @entity6 active - duty military			1
" i 've had a lot of @entity7 - @entity6 contact me and say , ' @entity14 , you get it , ' " @entity11 told @entity1			1
" you understand -- yes , there is a civil war going on			1
you understand how @entity7 society works			2
you understand this split within the @entity20			0
you understand valley - ism , or whatever you want to call it			2
" the 36 - year - old former @entity24 captain resigned on september 10 over what he termed a " cavalier , politically expedient and pollyannaish misadventure			2
" since then , even active - duty military have supported his decision , he said on @entity1 's " @entity29 , " scheduled to air at 1 p.m. et sunday on @entity1			1
" i have received many many e-mails from active - duty military and some guys who just separated from the service , " @entity11 said			1
" some guys are here in the @entity37			0
i 've gotten many e-mails from guys in @entity7			2
some are people i know			0
but a lot are people i do not know			0
men and women who are saying , ' thanks for doing this			0
we do n't know why we 're here			0
we 're not sure why we 're taking these casualties			0
we do n't know what it 's accomplishing			0
' " in his letter , the senior civilian representative in @entity53 , @entity7 , said he was resigning because " i fail to see the value or worth in continued @entity6 casualties or expenditures of resources in support of the @entity7 government in what is , truly , a 35 - year - old civil war			1
" he concluded the letter by saying that he had " lost confidence " that the " dead have sacrificed for a purpose worthy of futures lost , love vanished and promised dreams unkept			0
" " i believe that the people we are fighting there are fighting us because we are occupying them , " @entity11 told @entity1 earlier this week			1
" not for any ideological reasons , not because of any links to @entity74 , not because of any fundamental hatred towards the @entity76			0
the only reason they 're fighting us is because we 're occupying them			2
" after @entity11 submitted his resignation , @entity81 , the @entity84 administration 's special representative in @entity7 and neighboring @entity85 , made a plea for @entity11 to change his mind			1
" the offer was to join his staff and be put in a position where i could continue to write and try to influence policymakers from within the administration , " @entity11 said friday			2
" two things : one , if i believed in the mission , if i believed it was worth our guys dying for , if i believed that 60,000 troops in @entity7 would defeat @entity74 somehow -- which it wo n't -- i would have stayed in @entity53 , " he said			1
" however , the other part of it , too , was that i realized that the administration was going to make its decision shortly and then i would be stuck			0
and if i do n't believe in it , if i do n't believe this cause is right , if i do n't believe it 's justified , then there 's no reason to take that position			0
" @entity1 terrorism analyst @entity111 disagreed with @entity11 's assessment of @entity7			1
" it 's not that our presence there is causing the problem , " he said			0
" quite the reverse : it is that we are not doing what we said were going to do , which is bringing a measure of security and a measure of prosperity			0
" but @entity7 's lack of infrastructure and " human capital " make it an especially difficult mission , said @entity11 , who served two tours in @entity131 as a @entity24			1
" in @entity131 , even though it was stuck in the ' 80s , it had infrastructure , it had human capital , " he said			0
" it had doctors and lawyers and educators			0
and they had an established system of government , they had an infrastructure we could build on			0
@entity7 has none of that			2
" in his letter , @entity11 -- who signed on in march for a yearlong , noncareer position with the @entity3 -- said the cost of a war with no end in sight and no clear mission was too much to bear			1
" i do not believe any military force has ever been tasked with such a complex , opaque and sisyphean mission as the @entity6 military has received in @entity7 , " @entity11 wrote			1
news of @entity11 's resignation came as the administration continues to deliberate whether to change course in an eight - year conflict once dubbed a " war of necessity " by president @entity84			1
gen. @entity165 , the top @entity6 commander in @entity7 , reportedly has submitted a request for as many as 40,000 additional troops			1
@entity165 's request is being weighed against a backdrop of spiraling @entity6 military fatalities			1
there have been 58 @entity6 military fatalities in october , making it the deadliest month for @entity6 armed forces in @entity7 since the war began in october 2001			1
more troops is not the way to go , @entity11 said friday			1
" increasing troops is only going to fuel insurgency			1
we need to stop our combat operations in areas where we are fighting people only because they are fighting us			0
otherwise , it 's going to be 2013 , we 're going to look back four years and we 're going to say , " what did we accomplish ? what did we get ? what was this worth ? what did we get out of this ? " @entity3 spokesman @entity191 said the administration respects @entity11 's decision			2
" we take his opinions very seriously , " @entity191 said			0
" senior officials on the ground in @entity7 and here in @entity0 have talked to him , have heard him out			2
we respect ... his right to dissent			0

@entity11 believes increasing troops is only going to fuel insurgency , not help the problems
