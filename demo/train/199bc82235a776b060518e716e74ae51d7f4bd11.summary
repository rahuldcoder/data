@entity0 raised an eye - popping $ 4.6 million over the past three months for his bid in the @entity4 special election for the @entity5			1
the @entity8 mayor 's cash haul that was announced thursday is the latest example of the skyrocketing costs of winning election or re-election to @entity13			0
last year , winning @entity5 candidates spent an average of $ 10.3 million , according to the latest edition of @entity17 on @entity13 , which was released this week			1
that 's a 62 % increase , adjusted for inflation , since 1986			1
the report indicates that it took , on average , $ 1.6 million to win a @entity24 seat in 2012 , a 344 % increase since 1986			1
that increase is dwarfed by spending of outside independent groups , especially following the @entity31 's @entity30 decision in 2010			0
that ruling removed legal barriers preventing corporations and unions from spending unlimited sums on federal elections			0
@entity5 insiders look outside as they run for re-election outside groups spent $ 457 million on @entity5 and @entity24 races in 2012 , according to the report , compared to $ 9 million in 1986			1
in 1978 , such groups spent only $ 303,000 to influence @entity5 and @entity24 elections			1
" the most striking to me is the explosion in outside spending , " said @entity45 , a resident scholar at @entity46 , which contributed to the report			0
" the numbers for ( political action committees ) become a surrogate for the huge amounts outside what candidates and parties spend themselves			0
so for @entity58 , the nightmare is the @entity59 ( an independent fiscal conservative group ) spending big money to challenge incumbents like @entity62 from the right , meaning the party is pulled even further to the right , " @entity45 said			0
" and for all incumbents , the fear of an alien predator individual or group parachuting in behind the lines in the final two weeks of the campaign with a multimillion dollar ad blitz means they spend even more precious hours doing call time to raise money , " he added			0
but the report , which uses @entity76 data compiled by the non-partisan @entity77 , indicated that incumbents in both the @entity24 and @entity5 , not surprisingly , tended to outspend their challengers			2
but the fund - raising disparity was far more pronounced in @entity24 races			2
on average , @entity24 incumbents outspent their rivals $ 1.7 million to $ 587,000 , a ratio of almost a 3 - 1			2
incumbent senators spent on average $ 10.7 million compared to $ 7.2 million for challengers			0
challengers narrowed the spending gap with incumbents in competitive @entity24 races but not by much			2
incumbents who were re-elected with less than 60 % of the vote raised on average $ 2.3 million in the 2012 cycle , slightly more than double the $ 929,000 spent on average by their challengers			2
incumbents re-elected in competitive @entity5 races still outspent their rivals but by a much narrower gap of $ 12.8 million to $ 10.1 million			1
the report also shows that outspending opponents did not necessarily guarantee victory			0
@entity24 incumbents who lost their re-election bids in 2012 on average spent more than their challengers -- $ 3.1 million to $ 2.5 million .			1

spending on winning @entity5 races has increased 62 % in 2012 dollars since 1986
the increase is more pronounced in the @entity24 , where winning a race there increased by *334* %
biggest increase is in outside groups , which went from $ 9 *miilion* in 1986 to $ 457 million in 2012
