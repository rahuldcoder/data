@entity0 -- it might not really matter if president @entity3 made his case on @entity5 to the @entity7 people			1
he did n't really ask them for anything in his televised address but to sit tight and watch the graphic videos of chemical weapons on @entity13 as the surprise diplomatic track he 's now chosen plays out			1
the question now for @entity7 on @entity5 -- rather than whether the @entity7 should launch military strikes after the regime of @entity19 used chemical weapons on his own people -- is who they think is a better negotiating partner for @entity3 : @entity23 or @entity24 ? " all eyes are on the @entity27 president -- president @entity24 , " senate majority leader @entity28 said on wednesday			1
" we all know that he was former head of the @entity30			0
we all know about the @entity30			0
he is president of that very big country and we are all so grateful that even though relations are n't perfect with @entity27 they are ok			0
" all eyes turn to @entity7 - @entity27 talks there probably are n't many people in @entity0 who would use " ok " to describe @entity3 's relationship with @entity23			1
whether getting on this diplomatic track was a good idea or not probably has a lot to do with how you view the president and his leadership style already			0
it 's a bit more complicated than a simple choice of who he 'd rather negotiate with , but @entity3 essentially chose @entity24			1
a brief flirtation with @entity23 suggested lawmakers were more than willing to reject a president 's request for the use of force for the first time in recent memory			1
on the one hand , after going from an imminent strike to seeking congressional authorization to taking a diplomatic route , critics have described him as being about as indecisive as an @entity7 president can be			0
on the other , the @entity27 and @entity5 are at the negotiating table and @entity5 has promised to join the @entity67			1
that 's something he tangibly achieved without dropping bombs			0
5 questions : did @entity3 answer them ? how he got there was messy			1
that 's the word his own staffer used			0
@entity81 means progress , " an administration official told @entity1 's @entity79 as the diplomatic solution was presenting itself			2
whether the solution actually pans out remains anyone 's guess			0
but that 's ok with most lawmakers , many of whom did n't really want to vote on @entity5 anyway			1
even an unsure diplomatic solution is better than a military one for war - weary members of @entity23			2
" we do have to keep in mind an imperfect application of the @entity27 proposal is better than anything we can accomplish through the ( president 's military plan ) , " said rep. @entity94 , @entity95 , in a speech on the @entity98 floor on wednesday			2
sen. @entity106 , the @entity107 who favored giving the president authority to launch military strikes , told @entity1 's @entity112 that the president is making it hard for @entity23 to work with him on just about anything			1
" the president just seems to be very uncomfortable with being commander in chief of this nation , " @entity106 said , although he added that he hopes the new diplomatic track pans out			2
" he just ca n't follow through , " said @entity106 , who was clearly frustrated that the president had n't made a stronger argument to the nation that when an @entity7 president draws a red line , no country should be able to cross it without repercussions			0
@entity3 will need senators like @entity106 to work with him now that @entity5 has been paused on @entity129			1
given @entity7 ' continued focus on the economy , this president may be judged more for how he handles the looming two - headed fiscal dragon of government funding and debt ceiling authority			0
those issues will fester over the next two weeks until government funding runs out october 1 and the debt limit is reached as soon as october 18			0
on those matters , he 's not going to get any help from @entity24			2
he must figure out how to work with @entity23 .			0

who is a better negotiating partner for @entity3 -- @entity23 or @entity24 ?
the promise of a deal to remove @entity5 's chemical weapons was an accomplishment
even a source in @entity3 administration described the *situation* as ' messy '
