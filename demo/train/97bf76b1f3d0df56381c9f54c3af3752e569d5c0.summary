-- fifty - two superheroes are getting a makeover , and comic book fans ca n't stop talking about it -- even though they 've seen this sort of thing before			1
@entity7 announced tuesday on its blog , and in exclusive interviews with @entity10 , that come september , not only will many of its titles get a more modern look under respected artist @entity14 's direction , but they 'll also get renumbered , starting issue counts back at no. 1			1
( @entity7 , like @entity0 , is owned by parent company @entity18			1
) for readers emotionally invested in the stories of superheroes like @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24 , this kind of announcement can be threatening			2
based on fans ' @entity29 reaction , it 's obvious that anxiety , or at the very least skepticism , has set in			1
" i 've seen their attempts to revamp before , " said @entity33 , a 39 - year - old client performance strategist who has been collecting comic books for 20 years			2
" so , i guess i 'm going in with some guarded skepticism , " he said			2
he wonders what kind of stories @entity7 has up its sleeve , and how interesting they could be			1
he hopes the iconic publisher can pull it off , he said			0
" i was the biggest @entity14 fan in the ' 90s , and then after seeing what he did to the @entity24 costume , i 'm a little hesitant to see what he 's done with the rest of the @entity49 and the rest of the @entity51 , " @entity33 said			0
fans also know that any kind of reboot is , in part , a business decision for the comic book publisher			2
" what they 're shooting for is the opportunity for readers to jump on at an issue no. 1 , " said @entity58 , manager of @entity59 in @entity60 , @entity61			0
" new readers feel like , ' oh , it 's a no. 1 , i could start reading it now , ' " she said			0
comic book sales often jump up with a no. 1 issue , she said , " but i think it gets tiresome , from a collector 's point of view , to constantly have to renumber your collection			0
" with comic books , she explained , many titles order story lines by volumes			2
at the beginning of a new volume , the issue number of a comic book may or may not roll back to no. 1			0
so for hard - core , superorganized collectors who have been following one comic book for a long time , she said , the chronological order of their copies is n't always so logical			0
and renumbering has n't always been appreciated in the past			2
" one book that comes to mind is @entity24 , " said @entity92 , a @entity7 fan and blogger for girls - gone - geek.com			1
the @entity24 comic book was relaunched by @entity7 in 2006 , and by last year the new volume had reached issue no. 44			1
after a fan write - in campaign , @entity7 revised the issue numbers to reflect the original starting date of the title , resulting in the next issue being numbered 600			1
" fans were like , ' yes ! ( @entity24 ) deserves that high number because she 's been around since the 1940s , this puts her right up there with @entity23 and @entity22 , ' " said @entity92			2
despite all the apprehension , fans say they want @entity7 to be successful in this latest endeavor			1
they know that more people reading comic books means they get to keep collecting			0
so even if @entity7 's across - the - board revamp is n't engineered to please loyal fans , it 's a move that they understand -- because it 's designed to bring new readers into the fold			1
for the most part , said @entity92 , comic book collectors are in their mid- 30s , which may surprise outsiders who think comic books are juvenile			0
younger people are not collecting comic books the way they were 20 years ago , she said			0
@entity33 points out that comic books are n't generally available at the corner store anymore , so the impulse buys he made at the drug store in his youth are less likely to happen			0
these days , comic books are sold almost exclusively in comic book stores			2
that 's where the second part of @entity7 's announcement comes in : with the renumbering , they 'll be offering day - and - date digital			1
that means that the same day new issues of comic books are in stores , they 'll be available for download as well			1
@entity33 said he thinks younger readers are more likely to read comics electronically			2
" we 're having a party , " said @entity149 editor @entity149			0
" we want as many people coming to that party as possible			0
if day - and - date digital is a way to get more people involved in comics and see what we 're doing , i think that 's great			1
" " it seems to be the way the whole world is going , " he said			0
in addition to the announcement tuesday that the comic book " @entity49 " would be starting again at issue no. 1 in september , @entity7 officials told @entity0 the publisher would also be renumbering and modernizing such titles as @entity24 , @entity171 , @entity172 , @entity173 , @entity174 , @entity175 , @entity176 , @entity177 , captain atom and @entity179			1
the characters brought to the fore with the reboot will be interacting in ways they never have before in the @entity51 , said @entity7 editor - in - chief @entity184			1
" for me , i wanted to get into the @entity187 character , who will be part of the @entity49 , " @entity149 said			0
" he 's always been one of my favorites from the @entity191 and now to see him step up , really take his place among the bigger pantheon of heroes is excellent			0
he 's such a cool character			0
" " we 're doing a book called ' @entity201 ' and to see the excitement between the artist ( @entity204 ) and the writer ( @entity205 ) , taking a classic @entity7 character , and to see what they 're doing with it is so amazing , " said @entity184 of the energy he sees in the pages of the rebooted title			1
" it 's an epic that we 're putting together , and we 're incredibly excited about it , " he said			0
even so , fans still have unanswered questions about the upcoming reboot			2
as @entity7 continues to announce its 52 superhero titles getting the treatment , fans ca n't help but wonder what will change			1
for example , after giving @entity24 pants , what will @entity14 do to modernize @entity7 's other heavy hitters , @entity22 and @entity23 ? @entity7 would n't tell @entity0			1
guess we 'll have to wait and see .			0

@entity7 will be renumbering 52 of its superhero titles in september
new comics will be available for download same day they appear in stores
