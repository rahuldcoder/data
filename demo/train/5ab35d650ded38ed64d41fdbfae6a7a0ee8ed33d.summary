a group of female students are outraged that their @entity3 high school digitally edited their photographs in the 2014 yearbook for apparently violating a dress code and failed to apply that policy to other apparent violators			1
intensifying the controversy are comments from the leader of the @entity12 in @entity13 , who called for a school district investigation thursday into the clothing policy , which she says is an example of a culture that shames girls and women			1
school leaders stood by the dress code thursday but admitted inconsistency in the digital editing , for which the superintendent apologized			1
at issue is a dress policy that @entity28 in @entity28 says it posted on yearbook picture day last fall : no tank tops			1
no low - cut tops			1
no inappropriate slogan on shirts			0
violations would result in the students ' portraits being edited , the school said			1
now that the yearbook has been distributed , several female students are complaining that their pictures were altered to show less skin without their knowledge , according to @entity45 affiliate @entity44			0
no boys ' photos were digitally edited , the girls argued			1
" they did n't tell you before they edited it , and they did n't give you an option to fix it , so you look funny in your yearbook picture , " sophomore @entity49 told the news outlet			2
but the high school asserts that a large sign -- 4 feet by 5 feet -- warned all students of the policy at picture day last fall , the school said on its @entity64 page			2
in response , the female students say that the pictures of some girls who apparently violated the dress policy were n't edited at all -- an accusation that prompted the superintendent 's apology and a school promise to review its editing practices			1
" i feel like they put names in a hat and pick and choose who , " sophomore @entity75 told the affiliate			0
" there were plenty of girls that were wearing thicker tank tops , and half of them got edited and half of them did n't			1
" indeed , @entity75 's photo was clearly edited , according to images she showed the news station			0
her original photo shows her wearing a low - cut top , but in the yearbook , her neckline is raised and covers a tattoo near her clavicle , the station reported			1
superintendent @entity98 of the @entity99 defended the policy , but he apologized " in the sense that we wanted to be more consistent with what it is we 're trying to do , " he told the affiliate			2
on its @entity64 page , the school acknowledged that errors were made			0
" in the application of these graphic corrections , the high school yearbook staff did make some errors and were not consistent in how they were applied to student photos and the school apologizes for that inconsistency , " the school said			1
" @entity28 and @entity99 are evaluating the practice of photo editing of pictures as it now stands and will make a determination on further use of the practice			2
" but the @entity12 in @entity13 raised broader issues , noting how female survivors of sexual violence " almost always blame themselves for wearing the wrong clothing or somehow encouraging men to rape them through their reckless behavior , " the center said on its @entity64 page			2
@entity132 , the center 's executive director , says the school district should investigate the policy and the school 's digital editing of yearbook photos			1
the center is @entity3 's only independent , non-profit agency providing full - time services to survivors of sexual violence ages 14 and older			1
" this action , a decision made by a few school officials with no apparent consultation with students or parents , is just unacceptable , " @entity132 said in a statement			0
" it is a keen example of how our culture , and especially those in power to make such random decisions , shame young women into thinking they must dress and act in one narrow , acceptable way			2
" this is the start of a continuum that nurtures and even encourages control over girls and women			0
what is more personal than their clothing choices ? this is not about setting school dress codes , which schools certainly have the right to do			0
these were photos the girls paid for , yearbooks they bought with their own money			0
this is a public school , supported with tax dollars , " @entity132 said			0
@entity98 was n't immediately available for comment on @entity132 's accusations			0
for now , students will have to live forever with what they describe as unflattering photos in their yearbook			0
" i was upset because my shirt was a cream color and the color of the cover - up was completely white			0
it looks like white - out on my skin , " sophomore @entity187 told @entity44 .			0
