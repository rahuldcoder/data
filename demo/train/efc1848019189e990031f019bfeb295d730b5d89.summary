@entity0 , @entity1 -- the commercial heart of @entity1 's capital is still at risk of flooding , with the next 10 days likely to be crucial in the battle to keep dry			1
so far the @entity8 , or @entity8 , has been shielded by a series of flood defenses backed up by huge pumps which suck the floodwater seeping down from the north of the city into the canals			1
from here the water is funneled into the main @entity18 , where officials say it then fans out toward the sea			0
floods in @entity1 have killed more than 500 people since july , affecting about a third of the nation 's 77 provinces			1
the country of 67 million is also home to electronics manufacturing and automotive companies that have had to stop production because of the flooding , causing a ripple effect through the industry			2
according to @entity36 , a water engineer who has acted as consultant for the government during the crisis , @entity0 's central business district will survive the watery onslaught as long as the pumps keep working			1
" if we can maintain the system for the next 10 days , then we can keep the @entity8 free from floods , " he said			1
" but if the pumps break down , we could see more major flooding			2
we do n't know the condition of the pumps			0
" @entity51 added that @entity52 and @entity53 have now provided pumps as well as valuable expertise			0
the pumping stations are the front line in this war against the filthy torrent			0
the giant pumps sit at the side of canals on the fringes of central @entity0 , acting as the boundaries between the dry land on one side and the flood - hit city on the other			1
the business aside from the huge volume of water , those manning the pumps 24 hours a day have their hands full clearing out huge amounts of debris floating into the system and threatening to clog it up			2
it 's back - breaking work as city workers carry baskets full of foul - smelling rubbish to the convoy of trucks pulling up nearby			2
" the system has n't broken yet , " said one of the workers optimistically when asked how the pumps were holding up			0
according to @entity0 's @entity92 , this year 's devastating floods in northern @entity1 created an estimated 14 billion cubic meters of run - off			1
the @entity94 quoted spokesman @entity95 as saying about three billion cubic meters of this water is in the @entity18 , with 3.5 billion cubic meters in the fields in the central provinces north of @entity0			1
the rest , he said , has penetrated flood walls and inundated many parts of the capital -- with depths of up to three meters ( 9.8 feet ) reported in northern districts , such as @entity105 and @entity106			1
but with about 400 million cubic meters of water being drained into the sea every day , the floodwater could be drained out of the capital in 11 days , he said			1
despite this optimism , the @entity110 is throwing up more flood barriers to protect the center of the city			2
a system of half - ton sandbags known as " @entity118 " dikes stretching 6 kilometers ( 3.72 miles ) is almost complete along the main @entity120 road , which snakes out to the north of @entity0			1
but @entity51 warned that some angry residents in the worst - hit areas of northern @entity0 have been destroying flood barriers because they feel their districts have been sacrificed to protect the cbd			1
" upstream the flood level is three meters , while further downstream it is less than 0.5 meters ( 1.6 feet ) , " he explained			2
" so the people upstream say this is unfair for them			0
" he said these people needed better information from the government			0
earlier this week , prime minister @entity132 appealed for people to consider their actions			0
" please do n't destroy the big - bag dike and other barriers , " @entity135 wrote on her official @entity137 page			0
" please think about the overall benefit so we can get through this problem together			0
" " but what should we do ? " asked @entity143 , a factory owner from @entity105			0
" we are just left to deal with water that is going nowhere			0
" many @entity0 residents opted to to defy government advice to evacuate and remained behind to protect their homes			1
as a result they are worried about tainted water , disease and sanitation , as massive piles of garbage stack up around them			0
tide marks on the walls of many of their houses in this part of the city show that the water level has dropped only slightly in almost a month , which suggests the 11 - day prediction for the floodwaters to drain out of @entity0 may be ambitious			2
" it will take at least a month , " said @entity51 of @entity1 's worst floods in 50 years			1
but that of course depends on those mighty pumps .			0

a series of flood defenses are preventing flooding in @entity0 's central business district
@entity1 's worst flooding in 50 years has devastated outlying parts of the capital
angry residents in north @entity0 say *neighborhoods* sacrificed for " @entity8 "
residents : predictions that floodwater will be drained from @entity0 in 11 days too optimistic
