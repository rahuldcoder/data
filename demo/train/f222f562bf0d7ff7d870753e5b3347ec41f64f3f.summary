-- before you 're outraged at yet another story on @entity3 , the mom who sparked outrage with her scantily clad " what 's your excuse ? " photo , or @entity10 , the fitness blogger who created a firestorm after posting a shot that she claimed was just four days after giving birth , hear me out			1
this is not a story about them , why they did what they did , whether they are " fat - shaming " by posting the photos or how on @entity23 they have time to look like that as moms			1
no , this is not about them : it 's about us			1
why do those post-pregnancy fitness selfies and photos get under our skin so much ? and if they make us so upset , why do we keep looking at them ? @entity39 's @entity38 photo , where she shows off her washboard stomach alongside her three toddlers , has been seen more than 16 million times			1
" i think it makes us crazy because you are either one of two people : you either have the resources and ability and time to work your booty off all through pregnancy and immediately afterward in order to have that body , or you 're genetically blessed , and not many of us fall into those two camps , " said @entity47 , a @entity48 mom of two young boys and founder of the blog @entity51			1
@entity47 , who battled an eating disorder when she was younger , said part of the frustration comes from having to no longer just compete with the models and actresses who seem to bounce back immediately after giving birth			0
now there 's also pressure from other moms on social media			1
" it taps into a really seventh - grade place in us where we feel bad about ourselves , " @entity47 said with a chuckle , remembering what she described as the " you 're pretty , so i 'm ugly , " mentality of middle school			1
" it can just be hard to take , but i think it says more about me when i get upset about it than it does the person who posted the picture			0
" @entity84 , spokeswoman for the @entity85 , says the vitriolic online response to these post-pregnancy photos stems from women who " have had it up to here with this post-baby body reveal business			1
" " i do n't think it 's helpful to shame individuals who post pictures of themselves ... but i understand the frustration , and i think it 's coming from this post-baby body fatigue , " said @entity84 , co-author of the book " does this @entity100 ? " " we 're just really hit over the head with this message constantly that ( losing weight ) should be our priority as new mothers , and it 's a really , really skewed way of looking at things			1
" ' @entity109 ' : extreme dieting while pregnant @entity111 suffered from an extreme obsession with weight during her second pregnancy , battling what 's become known as " pregorexia			2
" she worries about the messages these photos might be sending to women and girls			2
" it 's not just moms looking at these pictures , " said @entity111 , of @entity121 , @entity122 , who is now an eating disorder specialist and trauma therapist			1
" there are teens looking at these pictures thinking , ' ok , this is how i 'm supposed to look after i have a baby			0
' ... it can start eating disorders			0
" @entity111 says " 99.99 % " of women who give birth wo n't look like @entity10 four days later , but a good chunk of those same women ca n't stop themselves from comparing their body with hers			2
" we automatically compare , " @entity111 said			0
" when you see pictures like this , it 's kind of like , ' so what 's wrong with me ? why ca n't i do that ? ' " the @entity148 radio host and television personality @entity149 , co-host of @entity153 's " dr. @entity152 , " said the driving force for the upset is our own insecurities			2
" it is the same insecurity that makes us look at other people 's @entity38 pages and wonder if our lives are n't measuring up , " @entity149 said			2
" we compare because the people who look thinner , more gorgeous , happier , better engaged in their relationships ... highlight our own feelings of less - than			0
" why ca n't we turn away ? if these post-pregnancy photos ultimately make us feel worse about ourselves , why do n't we try to avoid them in the first place ? instead of turning away from them , we seem to click on them , share them and comment on them			1
" it 's culturally ingrained in us that our worth is graded by our beauty , " @entity47 said			2
" the first thing that 's said to us is ' are n't you cute ? are n't you pretty ? ' " when we get older , logically we realize that we are about more than our looks , @entity47 said , although she concedes it 's so easy to fall back into bad habits			2
@entity183 : the girl in the mirror is my enemy " it still can tap a chord in you			0
... it floods the system , almost , and you ca n't think logically			0
you react emotionally , and i 'm guilty of that as well			0
" @entity84 said it 's especially hard for women to shut out the images because they 're " in our faces all of the time			1
" when or if the images start to make women ask themselves the question , " what 's wrong with me ? because i do n't look like that , " @entity84 recommends some mental refocusing			2
" it 's just constantly repeating to yourself , ' no , it 's not me			0
it 's this message , and i need to not absorb this , ' " she said			1
why can we be so mean ? the backlash against @entity39 and @entity10 was immediate and overwhelmingly negative from the start and is another example , in my humble opinion , of how nasty we women can be to each other			0
" the biggest issue to me is the lack of honesty , " said @entity149 , the radio and television host and mom of two			0
" if we own our own insecurities and doubts ... then maybe we will congratulate each other when there 's an authentic win -- like a job promotion or a great ( picture ) in a bathing suit after giving birth , or even the win of the best body gene pool , " she said			1
she added this nugget , which i love : if we focus on what makes us unique , maybe the " instinct to be bitter about someone who has something ( we ) do n't will dissipate			0
" @entity84 says we can also do something else			0
the next time we 're about to comment on someone 's post-baby weight , we can shift the conversation			1
" when you find yourself tempted to compliment somebody on how ( they got ) the baby weight off , just take a moment and stop yourself and think about what else you could ask about and something that might ... take it to a deeper level			0
