@entity4 foreign minister @entity10 said monday that @entity3 secretary of state @entity11 postponed a face - to - face meeting with @entity4 president @entity13 to discuss @entity3 proposals , which @entity15 has effectively rejected , on solving the crisis			1
the meeting , which @entity4 said was supposed to happen monday , would have marked the highest - level contact between the two countries since @entity4 troops took up positions in @entity6 , and would have come ahead of sunday 's potentially explosive vote on whether @entity6 should split from @entity22 and join @entity4			1
but @entity11 told @entity10 he needed to know @entity15 would engage seriously on a diplomatic solution before meeting with the @entity4 leader			1
he also wanted to see and end to @entity4 's " provocative steps " before traveling to @entity4			0
relations between @entity4 and the @entity27 have grown increasingly tense since @entity4 soldiers seized effective control of the @entity31 region			0
the @entity3 and other @entity33 powers have threatened possible sanctions in response to @entity4 's moves , but @entity15 has shown little sign of backing down			2
a senior @entity3 official said a proposal , which @entity11 presented to @entity10 in @entity40 on wednesday , summarized several rounds of talks @entity11 and his counterparts from @entity44 , @entity45 and @entity46 held separately with @entity10 and @entity22 's foreign minister			1
because @entity10 was not authorized to negotiate in @entity40 , @entity11 gave him the list of ideas to take back to @entity13			1
according to the senior @entity3 official , the @entity11 proposal calls for @entity4 troops to return to their barracks and for the disarming of so - called " self - defense " militias in @entity6 who , although they do n't wear insignia , are believed to be @entity4			1
international monitors would be dispatched to @entity6 and other parts of @entity22 as part of the proposed plan			0
@entity0 also insisted @entity15 drop plans in the @entity62 to annex @entity6 and end its support for next sunday 's referendum by @entity65 to join @entity4			2
the @entity3 also wants @entity4 to support a deal between the new @entity22 government and the @entity68 on a program to shore up the country 's fragile economy			0
the plan hinges on talks between @entity4 and @entity22 on ending the crisis			0
@entity11 and the @entity44 , @entity45 and @entity46 foreign ministers spent the better part of wednesday trying unsuccessfully to get @entity10 to meet with @entity22 's foreign minister , who flew on @entity11 's plane from @entity40 to @entity79			1
@entity4 lawmakers to debate bill on @entity6 joining nation because @entity4 does not recognize the new @entity22 government , @entity10 was reluctant to sit down with the foreign minister for direct talks			1
@entity3 and its @entity33 allies have proposed the two sides could talk as part of a " contact group " which also includes the @entity3 , @entity44 , @entity45 and @entity46 the @entity11 plan also integrated some elements of the february 21 deal to end the standoff between protestors in @entity79 and former president @entity94			2
even though @entity15 never joined @entity46 , @entity96 , and the @entity44 in signing the pact , it had some concessions to @entity4 , including a national unity government , a return to the constitution and early elections			0
on friday , @entity3 president @entity103 and president @entity13 spoke by phone and agreed that @entity11 and @entity10 will continue talking to try and find a diplomatic solution to the crisis			1
later that day , @entity10 called @entity11 and invited him to @entity108 for a meeting with @entity13 on monday			1
@entity11 said he would think about it , but that disturbing developments on the ground in @entity22 and @entity6 were closing the space for diplomacy			0
when they spoke again on saturday , @entity11 told @entity10 he was n't ready to meet with @entity13			2
the two of them needed to make more progress on their own talks , @entity11 said			0
furthermore , @entity11 said @entity4 military moves on the ground and discussions about the referendum in @entity6 and the @entity62 's plans to annex the region would make negotiations difficult			2

@entity10 traveled to @entity108 on sunday to discuss the one - and - a - half page document with @entity13			0
the official said that the @entity3 government has yet to receive an official answer from @entity15 about the ideas			1
but @entity4 seems uninterested in the @entity3 concept of sitting down with the @entity22 government			0
in a televised meeting with @entity13 monday , @entity10 said even @entity11 's revised proposal still fell short and " raises many questions on our side " because the starting point is acceptance of the " coup @entity148 © tat " that overthrew @entity94			1
" the document contains an approach which does n't quite suit us , as the entire wording suggests there is a conflict between @entity4 and @entity22 , " @entity10 said , adding that @entity4 would be submitting counterproposals to the @entity3 plan			2
" we prepared , together with members of the @entity158 , our counterproposals			0
they aim to resolve the situation on the basis of international law and take into account the interests of all @entity22 without exception , " he said			0
the @entity103 administration seems reluctant for @entity11 to travel to @entity4 for a meeting with @entity13 that could deliver very little			1
@entity11 is prepared to take part in talks " if and when we see concrete evidence that @entity4 is prepared to engage " with @entity0 's proposals , @entity170 spokeswoman @entity169 said , adding that @entity4 must engage in talks with the @entity22			0
" the point is we 're not just going to walk into something , where they 're just going to say ` no , no , no ' to everything and we 've traveled all the way there			0
we 're not going to do that , " another senior @entity3 official added			0
the @entity185 said president @entity103 would meet @entity22 's new prime minister in @entity0 on wednesday , warning @entity15 would face even more outside pressure if it took any further steps toward annexing @entity6			2
