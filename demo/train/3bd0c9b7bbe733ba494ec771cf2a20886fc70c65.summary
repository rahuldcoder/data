@entity0 -- @entity2 has unveiled a new automated advertising technology that promises to unlock the moneymaking potential of the microblogging site			1
the development of a @entity7 , or " application - programming interface " , satisfies a long - awaited desire of advertisers to increase and improve the reach of their marketing messages to @entity2 's 200m active users			1
a similar technology launched by @entity16 in 2010 helped that social network reach more than $ 3bn in revenues the following year , with analysts estimating the system currently generates roughly 60 per cent of the company 's revenues			2
@entity2 currently sprinkles paid tweets in a user 's timeline , amid posts from people and companies they have chosen to " follow "			2
@entity2 said users would not see more ads as a result of the new system , at least in the short term , but that pricing might increase for advertisers as its auctions to buy ads become more competitive			1
" as interest in @entity2 has grown , our focus has been on delivering better ads for users , not more ads , " said @entity39 , @entity2 's product manager for revenue , in a blog post			1
" our system rewards marketers for being good , not for being loud			0
" ms @entity39 told the ft that there was " no direct impact on the user experience in the short term " , although @entity2 users should see " more relevant and better ads " as a result of the new system , because it would be simpler for advertisers to use the targeting capabilities which it introduced last year			1
although she did not rule out a future increase in the inventory given over to ads , ms @entity39 said the company took users ' experience " really seriously "			1
" we take a slow and thoughtful approach , " she said			0
" our motto is to get it right rather than right now			0
" the new system will certainly increase ad revenue for the social media company , which is believed to be planning an initial public offering for early next year			0
research firm @entity71 estimates @entity2 revenues will grow nearly 90 per cent this year to $ 545.2m , and reach more than $ 800m in ad revenues worldwide by 2014			1
before the new platform , advertisers had to manage their @entity2 campaigns manually			2
the new system automates the process , streamlining the management process for advertisers and giving them more tools to " deliver the right message , to the right audience , " on both desktop computers and on mobile devices			0
it also allows ad buyers to integrate @entity2 campaigns with those on @entity16 and @entity89 , as well as search and display			2
@entity2 said it began testing the new @entity93 last month			1
it launched it on wednesday with five partners that oversee social media advertising purchases for large multinational companies , including @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity101 , @entity102 and @entity103			0
@entity2 noted earlier this month that it took four minutes after the @entity106 's unexpected power outage for the first " @entity107 " to appear referencing the blackout			0
using the @entity93 , @entity109 , chief executive of @entity103 , said that could be reduced to as little as four seconds , through greater automation			0
" this is an obvious and necessary piece of infrastructure that all companies with proprietary ads systems need , " said @entity112 , chief executive of @entity113 , an ad - targeting company that uses @entity116 and @entity16 's apis			0
but mr @entity112 , who as a product manager at @entity116 led the development of its @entity93 in 2003 - 05 , said that such platforms can be " tricky " because they " cede some control to third parties " , in return for helping @entity2 " significantly scale its active advertisers and campaigns "			1
" @entity2 's willingness to build an ads api signals that they 've reached a size where they feel that the accretive value of third parties -- to monetisation at least -- outweighs the risks , " he said			1
@entity99 did an early test of the platform with a few of its customers , including @entity141 , the clothing company , and its own @entity99 account , in an effort to increase the number of people who " follow " the brands on @entity2			2
by using granular targeting , segmenting the campaign by regions and testing different bid levels on pricing , the company increased its number of @entity2 followers by 63 per cent			0
" our customers have been asking us to include @entity2 " in @entity99 's media products , said @entity156 , senior vice-president of media and advertising solutions at @entity99			2
" promoted tweets and promoted accounts are important assets in creating a holistic digital marketing campaign			0
