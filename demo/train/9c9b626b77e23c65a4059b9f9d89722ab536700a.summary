despite the ray of good news in thursday 's @entity4 agreement on steps to de-escalate the crisis in @entity7 , president @entity0 was right to sound a note of caution , observing that " i do n't think we can be sure of anything at this point			1
" the deal , reached by @entity14 , @entity7 and the @entity15 , called for , among other things , disarming illegally armed @entity18 demonstrators in eastern @entity7 , and the surrender of the government buildings they have seized			1
these are good and essential first steps , but unless they can now be implemented as a basis on which the parties can move to further , bolder steps to reverse underlying trends , @entity7 could still slide into civil war			1
if this happened , how would it affect @entity31 national interests ? could @entity7 become a 21st century echo of the @entity33 in the 1990s , when the collapse of @entity35 saw a decade of war between @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 and @entity40 ? ( no one should forget that just a century ago @entity7 was sucked into a tragic , bloody civil war shortly after gaining independence in the aftermath of the @entity45			1
) there is a saying that history never repeats itself , but it does sometimes rhyme			0
fortunately , full - blown civil war in @entity7 still seems unlikely — mainly because one side , the @entity7 government , appears both unable and unwilling to fight			1
nonetheless , it 's not hard to sketch a scenario in which war is the outcome -- and from that to envision a further scenario in which the @entity31 finds itself drawn into a direct confrontation			0
( more on that in a moment			0
) as we have seen in the past two weeks in eastern @entity7 , @entity14 speakers — acting either spontaneously , or at the behest of @entity14 security services , or both — have taken control of government buildings in 10 cities in @entity7 's eastern provinces of @entity69 , @entity70 and @entity71			2
@entity7 military , security and police forces are so impotent , demoralized and compromised by @entity14 infiltration that their response has so far been pathetic			2
this week , the @entity77 reported on the @entity7 government 's " glaring humiliation , " when a military operation to confront pro-russian militants instead saw @entity7 's 21 armored vehicles separating into two columns , surrendering or retreating			0
in several instances , when confronted by @entity18 crowds , soldiers and policemen have even switched sides			0
if thursday 's deal unravels and @entity7 authorities remain unable to restore basic law and order , the @entity18 demonstrators occupying buildings will be emboldened to expand their reach			0
further steps may include the demonstrators setting up an independent " republic " in the three eastern regions and seeking to drive out forces loyal to @entity7 's interim government , provoking the @entity101 government to respond with greater force , and then calling in @entity14 troops to defend them against what they will claim to be " fascists " from western @entity7			0
responding to a crackdown , @entity14 security forces would likely provide arms and other assistance to the @entity14 speakers , claiming that such a call for assistance from " compatriots " is impossible to ignore			0
as conflict intensifies , western @entity7 , perhaps even @entity115 or other @entity116 , could come to the aid of @entity7			0
in this spiral , one thing could lead to the next , ending in significant bloodshed in eastern @entity7 , and perhaps even spreading beyond			0
widespread violence or civil war would certainly be a calamity for @entity7			1
but would its consequences for @entity31 national interests require an @entity31 military response ? fortunately for @entity31 , the answer is no. in 2008 , when @entity14 crushed @entity130 in a short war that ended in @entity14 's recognition of independence for the former @entity130 territories of @entity135 and @entity136 , that was president @entity138 's answer			2
as the ongoing civil war in @entity140 has claimed more than 150,000 lives , neither president @entity0 nor his most ardent critics , like @entity144 sen. @entity143 , have judged this such an extreme threat to @entity31 interests that @entity31 must kill and to die to stop it			1
that the @entity31 does not have vital national interests in @entity7 will not mean that the @entity31 has no national interest in holding @entity150 accountable for violating territorial integrity assurances that @entity14 and the @entity31 gave to @entity7 in 1994 in persuading it to give up nuclear weapons			1
indeed , if left to take its course , this crisis has the potential to fuel further developments that engage core @entity31 national interests			0
for example , if @entity158 becomes @entity160 's precedent for creeping annexation in which @entity14 - instigated @entity14 speakers occupy government buildings , liberate a territory and establish a relationship with @entity14 , where will this stop ? could the 25 % of the population in @entity168 who are @entity14 speakers be tempted ( or coaxed ) to follow suit ? ( both @entity168 and @entity14 vividly recall that in 1940 @entity171 annexed @entity168 , @entity172 and @entity173 , nations that regained their independence only in 1991 when the @entity176 collapsed			1
) @entity14 military intervention in @entity168 , even under the guise of special forces in green garb without insignia , would almost certainly be engaged by @entity168 military and police			0
if @entity14 security forces came to the assistance of their brethren in @entity168 , as they would be likely to do , this would mean a direct confrontation between @entity14 and the @entity31 - led @entity189			1
many @entity31 are not aware that @entity168 and its @entity191 neighbors are members of the @entity189 alliance , of which the @entity31 is the leader			2
how many @entity31 know that members of that alliance , including the @entity31 , commit themselves in @entity196 of the @entity197 to regard an attack against one @entity189 signatory as " an attack against them all " ? pursuant to that commitment , successive @entity31 presidents have approved war plans in which @entity31 would fight to defend the territory of all members of the alliance			2
preventing @entity7 's collapse into civil war must therefore be a high priority for the leaders of both the @entity31 and @entity14			1
the @entity4 agreement on " initial concrete steps to de-escalate tensions and restore security , " which @entity31 and @entity14 diplomats signed , along with their @entity215 and @entity7 counterparts , represents the first real step in the international community 's collective effort to reverse @entity7 's slide into chaos			1
leaders in both @entity224 and @entity150 will have to follow up with further , bolder steps to prevent @entity7 's spiraling into a civil war that could draw them into a direct confrontation			2
these additional steps will require all parties to accept arrangements that would be unacceptable — except for the fact that all feasible alternatives are even worse .			0

@entity235 : @entity4 deal on de-escalation in @entity7 a ray of hope
he says unless terms are implemented and conflict reversed , civil war still a threat
he says @entity15 does have an interest in *stalling* @entity14 - coaxed *incursions*
@entity249 : if @entity168 , part of @entity189 , were next , @entity31 could be *compelled* to enter conflict
