-- the federal government 's oil spill response director says testing has revealed that there is a " detected seep a distance from the well " and has ordered @entity7 to quickly notify the government if other leaks are found			1
" when seeps are detected , you are directed to marshal resources , quickly investigate , and report findings to the government in no more than four hours , " retired adm. @entity10 said in a letter to @entity7 chief managing director @entity17			1
" i direct you to provide me a written procedure for opening the choke valve as quickly as possible without damaging the well should hydrocarbon seepage near the well head be confirmed			2
" @entity7 spokesman @entity23 said sunday night that he had no information about the leak mentioned in @entity10 's letter			1
the letter does not provide further details about where the leak was spotted or how big it is			1
it was unclear from @entity10 's letter , released sunday evening , whether testing on the well had been extended			1
it was scheduled to last at least until 4 p.m. sunday			0
earlier in the day @entity10 said officials could decide to extend it in 24 - hour increments			1
" we 've not been told it 's stopping , " @entity23 said			0
in his letter sunday , @entity10 asked @entity7 to provide its " latest containment plan and schedule in the event that the @entity41 is suspended " within 24 hours and said the company should be prepared to discuss its efforts to detect leaks during a regular conference call between @entity7 and government scientists that was scheduled for 9 p.m. et. earlier sunday @entity7 chief operating officer @entity47 said a variety of tests showed oil and gas were not escaping from the well , noting that the recently recapped oil well in the @entity54 could remain closed until the relief well is drilled if tests remained favorable			1
" no one associated with this whole activity wants to see any more oil flow into the @entity54 , " @entity47 told reporters sunday morning			0
" we will continue integrity tests all the way until we get the well killed			1
there is no target to return the well to flow			0
" @entity10 said earlier sunday that testing would determine whether keeping the well capped was the right solution			2
pressure testing results in the well have been lower than expected , he said , which means oil could be leaking out from below			0
" while we are pleased that no oil is currently being released into the @entity54 and want to take all appropriate action to keep it that way , it is important that all decisions are driven by the science , " he said			0
" ultimately , we must insure no irreversible damage is done which could cause uncontrolled leakage from numerous points on the sea floor			0
" rep. @entity81 , who has been a vocal critic of @entity7 's response to the gusher , said sunday that the company could have another motivation for wanting to keep the well capped			2
" if the well remains fully shut in until the relief well is completed , we may never have a fully accurate determination of the flow rate from this well			2
if so , @entity7 -- which has consistently underestimated the flow rate -- might evade billions of dollars of fines , " @entity81 said in a letter to @entity10 released sunday			1
using ships on the surface to collect 100 percent of the gushing oil would allow scientists to calculate the flow rate -- a figure that the government would use to determine how much to fine @entity7 , @entity81 said			2
on saturday , @entity10 said that once testing is eventually stopped " we will immediately return to containment , using the new , tighter sealing cap with both the [ vessels ] @entity102 and the @entity103			1
" @entity7 is conducting regular seismic runs , monitoring sonar , visual and acoustic activity and the data has been " encouraging , " showing no problems			2
however if tests show problems , @entity7 officials said they are prepared to remove the tightly fitting containment cap and reassess			1
" we 're just taking this day by day , " @entity47 said sunday			0
" nobody wants to see any more oil go into the gulf , but clearly we have to make sure we do n't make the situation worse			0
" no oil has gushed out since thursday when @entity7 closed all the valves in a new custom - made cap that was lowered into place earlier in the week			1
the undersea video images of a quiet ocean inspired cautious optimism in the hearts of @entity54 coast residents devastated by three months of disaster			0
meanwhile , @entity7 has restarted work on drilling two relief wells			1
@entity130 said that the first relief well is now about five feet away from the ruptured @entity132 well and an intersection could occur by the end of july			0
@entity7 then plans to pump mud and cement down to kill the ruptured well			1
leaving the well capped sunday past the 24 hours of testing is a new development			0
on saturday , it was expected the testing would extend only into sunday afternoon			0
engineers and scientists have intensified monitoring of the well , pouring over images and data collected by robots , sonar scans and seismic and acoustic examinations			0
a government ship is in the area , fitted with equipment for detecting methane gas , which would be an indication of a leak			0
the well integrity test began thursday after two days of delays , first as government scientists scrutinized testing procedures and then as @entity7 replaced a leaking piece of equipment known as a choke line			2
since there 's less oil on the surface , @entity7 officials said sunday that the nearly 50 skimmers deployed at the well site collected nearly half the amount they had the day before			2
they only conducted one controlled burn , and @entity47 said there have been numerous days in a row with no new shoreline impacts			0
in the coming weeks , @entity7 also plans to bring in two more oil collection ships in addition to the two already in the @entity54 , bringing containment capacity to 80,000 barrels ( about 3.4 million gallons ) of oil a day , more than high - end estimates of how much oil had been leaking .			1

new : @entity10 says a leak was detected " a distance from the well "
new : letter orders @entity7 to provide *update* on plans
@entity7 says the recapped well is holding steady
if tests continue to be favorable , @entity7 says the cap could stay on until relief well is drilled
