-- to the litany of challenges that confront @entity5 's path to a better life , we can now add subdued economic growth as a result of the global financial crisis			1
a banana vendor stands on a flooded street as he waits for customers in @entity14 , @entity5 , on august 13			2
after three spectacular years of 9 percent - plus annual growth , @entity5 will reach just 6.3 percent next year , according to the latest forecast by the @entity17 in early november			2
the @entity18 is forecasting a more optimistic 7.5 to 8 percent			0
while 7.5 percent may still sound a good result , it is barely enough for the economy to keep pace with the 10 million - plus young people who will join the @entity5 job market in 2009			1
@entity5 's major shortcomings in infrastructure , education , health care and environmental protection are well known , as are the constant problems of corruption , poor governance , rural poverty , communalism , domestic terrorism , child labor , discrimination against women and natural disasters such as floods and earthquakes			1
but at least in recent years @entity5 could point to a strong economy as the platform on which it was making its push for higher living standards , social modernization and economic reform			2
since may 2004 , when prime minister @entity49 and finance minister @entity50 took on the reins of government , @entity5 's economy has had a charmed run			1
strong growth in business sectors such asinformation technology , pharmaceuticals , automotive , financial services and retail have coincided with a better performing agricultural sector , and a housing and consumption boom driven by easier credit			0
@entity5 's young working men and women -- more than half the country 's 1.15 billion people are aged 25 or less -- have shown a much greater propensity to spend , compared to their thrifty , risk - averse parents and grandparents			1
this willingness to go into debt rather than save has seen a massive rise in sales of consumer goods such as mobile phones , flat screen tvs , refrigerators , household utensils , motorcycles and cars			2
the same goes for spending on services , from tourism to healthcare to self - improvement			0
now the halcyon days appear to be over , as the international credit crunch flattens demand everywhere			0
already the downturn is seeing job losses in sectors such as aviation , financial services , retailing and export industries , as companies tighten their belts and put expansion plans on hold			0
the government admits things will get tougher , with @entity49 telling the nation on october 20 that " we must be prepared for a temporary slowdown in the @entity5 economy			0
" earlier that day , the @entity18 cut its key repurchase ( short - term lending ) rate by 100 basis points to 8 percent , saying it needed to ease the pressure on @entity5 's credit markets and maintain financial stability			1
it followed that with another cut to 7.5 percent on november 1			0
rbi governor dr. @entity116 noted the global downturn could be deeper and the recovery might take longer than earlier expected			0
" consequently , the adverse implications through trade and financial channels for emerging economies , including @entity5 , have amplified , " he said			0
economists and analysts have welcomed the central bank 's moves , which have included a 350 - basis point reduction in the cash reserve ratio -- the amount of money @entity5 banks must keep on hand -- between july and november			1
@entity133 , head of @entity135 economic research at investment bank @entity136 , said the rbi 's october 20 action was " well ahead of market expectations " and showed a bias towards growth and financial stability , against inflation			2
@entity136 had earlier cut its growth outlook for the 2009 - @entity145 to 7 percent and has warned the figure could go lower if the international financial turmoil continues over the next few months			2
but @entity133 believes that @entity5 's export drive -- which has seen exports triple since 2003 to about $ 163 billion in 2007 - @entity150 -- may not suffer too greatly			1
in a recent study , he found that about two - thirds of @entity5 's exports go outside the @entity154 and the @entity155 ( the two trade areas most affected by the downturn ) to @entity158 , @entity159 , @entity160 and @entity161			1
while @entity5 exports would slow , " the downside is limited , " he said			2
a lower @entity5 rupee would also help			0
foreign investment is slowing in line with the downturn			0
@entity169 's @entity5 economist @entity168 noted recently that " adverse global circumstances " are weighing on @entity5 's ability to attract overseas money			1
unless there is a dramatic turnaround in the global credit markets , @entity168 believes capital inflows could slow to $ 40 - 50 billion in the year ahead , compared with $ 110 billion in 2008			0
on the broader political front , @entity5 has to deal with a range of internal and external risks that include domestic communalism - cum - terrorism and the constant threat of conflict with @entity183 over the disputed @entity185 territory			2
@entity186 , @entity187 , @entity188 , @entity189 and @entity190 all add to a difficult neighborhood , while @entity5 's relations with @entity158 are cool at best , even as trade ties grow			1
territorial disputes linger from the 1962 border war between the two			0
that helps explain why @entity5 was named recently by @entity198 - based @entity197 ( @entity197 ) as the @entity200 country with the highest political and social risk for 2009			1
a report by @entity197 in late october assessed 16 countries in the @entity200 , and assigned @entity5 the highest risk rating of 6.87 , ahead of @entity205 with 6.28			2
@entity158 was seventh with 5.33 , behind @entity206 , @entity207 , the @entity208 and @entity209			0
@entity197 cited uncertainties surrounding @entity5 's coming general election -- due to be held by may 2009 -- along with rising communal violence and incidents of terrorism			1
" the biggest risk is that a deterioration in political and economic conditions in neighboring @entity183 could aggravate social unrest in @entity5 further , and hurt national security , " it noted			1
but it said @entity5 's underlying attractions to foreign investors should remain , " no matter who wins the next election			1
prime minister @entity49 , with six months of his government to run , is putting on a brave face			0
" it is when @entity5 is challenged that the @entity5 people rise to the occasion and convert the challenge into an opportunity			0
there is no place for fear , " he told the nation late last month			0
@entity237 writes on @entity5 business and is the author of " @entity5 's @entity240 " ( 2007 ) and " @entity5 's @entity241 " ( 2008 ) , both published by @entity243 .			1

@entity5 's economic growth will slow in 2009 , most economists project
@entity249 's young *population* has shown willingness to go into accrue debt to spend
infrastructure , corruption , health and education worries remain economic *hurdles*
@entity5 faces political , social risk in 2009 , according to @entity198 - based group
