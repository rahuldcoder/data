-- do you really turn off your smartphone , tablet or computer before takeoff and landing ? despite flight attendants telling passengers to power off , some people admit they do n't always shut down their devices			2
nearly one - third of passengers say they have accidentally forgotten to turn off their smartphones and other electronic devices in flight , according to this week 's joint study by the @entity16 and @entity17			1
while more than 90 % agree those flight attendant directions to turn off devices are clear , 59 % say they always turn their devices completely off and 21 % say they switch their devices to " airplane mode			1
" some 5 % say they sometimes completely shut down their devices			2
many travelers also admit they do n't actually understand when they can use those devices			0
more than 40 % wrongly believe they can use devices while taxiing to the runway , more than 30 % in the air before reaching 10,000 feet and 26 % on a flight 's final descent			0
almost every adult passenger who travels with portable electronic devices carried at least one such device on board , and nearly two - thirds used them in flight , the study found			1
debate continues over electronic gadgets on planes " airline passengers have come to rely on their smartphones , tablets and e-readers as essential travel companions , " said @entity41 , vice president of technology policy at the @entity17 , in a statement			0
" understanding the attitudes and behaviors of passengers that are using electronic devices while traveling will help the @entity53 make informed decisions			1
" the study results were shared with the @entity53 , according to an @entity16 website posting			2
an @entity53 representative declined to comment on the study results			2
hints of how the @entity53 might change the current rules regarding electronics in the air may come as soon as this summer			1
the @entity53 set up a working group in august to study the issue of portable electronics on flights and make suggestions for changes			1
" the @entity71 continues to have regular meetings and teleconferences , " said an @entity53 representative via e-mail			0
" we expect their report and recommendations shortly after the group finishes its work at the end of july			0
" both the @entity53 and @entity81 regulate electronics in the air			0
the @entity81 forbids the use of mobile phones using the 800 mhz frequency and other wireless devices on aircraft in flight because of " potential interference to wireless networks on the ground			0
" the @entity53 supports that in - flight restriction but does allow the use of cell phones while the plane is on the ground , at the gate or waiting for a gate -- but not when the aircraft is taxiing for takeoff			0
the @entity53 bans the use of wireless devices during flight because of " potential interference to the aircraft 's navigation and communication systems			0
" the @entity53 allows use of some non-transmitting electronic devices outside of critical phases of flight such as takeoff and landing			1
during those noncritical phases of flight , the airlines set their own policies regarding passenger use of non-transmitting electronic devices			1
