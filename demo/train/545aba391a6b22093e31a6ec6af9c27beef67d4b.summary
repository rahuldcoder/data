after years of causing angst for @entity3 political aides by delving into issues of race , attorney general @entity0 is heading to @entity6 , @entity7 , as president @entity9 's top emissary			1
the trip on wednesday to the @entity12 suburb now in the spotlight represents the latest effort by the @entity9 administration to find a way to calm racial tensions following the police shooting of @entity20 , 18			1
under @entity0 , the first black attorney general , the @entity21 has intensified its scrutiny of police departments , launching 20 investigations of police practices and alleged discriminatory enforcement patterns in the past five years			1
that 's more than twice the number of such probes in the previous five years			0
that record is part of @entity0 's pitch to reassure the local community in @entity6 that the @entity21 will properly investigate the shooting of @entity20 , who was unarmed , by a white officer , @entity38			1
@entity6 has been at the center of daily standoffs between protesters and police since the august 9 shooting			1
some of the protests have turned violent			0
@entity0 's visit will focus on the @entity21 's civil rights investigation , which is examining whether @entity38 acted properly in using deadly force			1
the federal probe is separate from a criminal one being conducted by local authorities			0
" at a time when so much may seem uncertain , the people of @entity6 can have confidence that the @entity21 intends to learn — in a fair and thorough manner — exactly what happened , " @entity0 wrote in an opinion piece for the @entity52 ahead of his trip			1
" we understand the need for an independent investigation , and we hope that the independence and thoroughness of our investigation will bring some measure of calm to the tensions in @entity6 , " he added			2
@entity0 has been outspoken on issues related to disparity in the judicial system and has led efforts to reduce disparities in sentences that statistically have greater effect on racial minorities			0
@entity9 cautious on @entity6 while those efforts have the backing of @entity9 , @entity0 's public views on the issue of race have n't always been welcome for the @entity3			2
in his first major speech after taking office in 2009 , @entity0 told a @entity84 gathering at the @entity21 : " though this nation has proudly thought of itself as an ethnic melting pot , in things racial we have always been and continue to be , in too many ways , essentially a nation of cowards			1
" @entity9 criticized the " nation of cowards " characterization , saying " if i had been advising my attorney general , we would have used different language			2
" privately , @entity0 believed he was right			0
but he stayed away from the issue for a while			0
at the same time , he vowed to reinvigorate the @entity21 's civil rights division , which was the center of controversy over partisan meddling during the administration of president @entity104			1
concerns about prosecutor that unit enforces a 1994 law approved after the @entity110 beating by police in @entity112 that makes it unlawful for police to engage in a pattern or practice that deprives people of their constitutional rights			0
of the 20 investigations the civil rights division has launched in the past five years , seven are ongoing , including those against police departments in @entity125 , @entity126 , and @entity127			1
as a result of increased scrutiny , there are now 13 law enforcement agencies subject to agreements with the @entity21			0
seven of those are under court - ordered consent decrees , the largest number in the department 's history			0
@entity0 has criticized some of the police response to the street protests in @entity6 , while at the same time advocating enforcement against people rioting and looting			1
he has sent @entity21 officials to provide technical assistance to police , suggesting less aggressive tactics and avoiding the use of military - style vehicles to deal with protesters			2
5 things to know about the shooting among those sent to @entity6 is @entity155 , who heads the @entity156			2
a former police chief in @entity158 , @entity159 , @entity155 is @entity160 and has spoken out about racial profiling by police			0
" i am a black man who is subject to increased scrutiny from my community , my profession , and my country because of the color of my skin , " @entity155 said at a 2012 hearing			0
he added that he is proud to be a police officer , but noted that " as a black man with a 14 - year - old son , @entity173 , i know that when i teach him how to drive a car i must also teach him what to do when stopped by the police -- a mandatory course for young men of color			2
" i must also prepare him for the bias he is likely to face and the reality that , despite the strength of his character or his contributions to society , there will be those who will attach criminality to him simply because of the color of his skin , " @entity155 said			0
