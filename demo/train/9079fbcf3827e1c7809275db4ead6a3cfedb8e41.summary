@entity0 -- @entity3 demonstrators spent sunday afternoon discussing how to respond to a call by the @entity5 to stop camping overnight at sites a few blocks from the @entity8			1
the park service notified protesters on friday that they " may be subject to arrest and their property subject to seizure as evidence " if there are evident " camping violations " by around noon monday			1
the notice for those in @entity18 and nearby @entity19 said that to comply with the federal agency 's camping regulations , demonstrators must remove all camping material from the sites and leave one side of all temporary structures open at all times			1
authorities describe the purpose of the order as necessary to ensure public health and safety			0
@entity31 cleans up after " occupy " clash @entity33 posted online from early sunday showed a man appearing to walk away from @entity36 members as he yelled out , " i have done nothing wrong			2
" two officers tried to grab him before a third officer used a stun gun on the man , who was then handcuffed			1
a @entity1 crew witnessed the arrest , which protesters said came after the man went from tent to tent removing notices posted by the @entity5			1
there was no immediate comment from park police on the incident , including whether the man was charged			2
later in the day , a small group of protesters met for about three hours under the statue of @entity57 hero maj. gen. @entity56 , which is in the middle of the park			2
a protester named @entity62 -- who would only give his first name , and who was n't participating in the meeting -- said one of the ideas being mulled if monday 's deadline were imposed would be to hold a " sleep strike , " in which demonstrators would play board games and do other things throughout the nights to avoid the " sleeping activities " banned by the @entity5			1
" i plan on not leaving and not sleeping as long as possible , " @entity62 said			0
pastor @entity75 of @entity0 's @entity76 said area churches have discussed helping house some of the protesters overnight so that they could continue a 24 - hour vigil if park police began enforcing the rules against overnight encampments			1
@entity84 , a @entity86 , @entity85 , resident who has been camping in the @entity87 for three weeks , said demonstrators from @entity89 and @entity90 , @entity91 , and @entity92 are expected to come monday to show solidarity with the capital demonstrators			2
whatever happens with the camps and police , @entity95 said it would not alter her and fellow demonstrators ' commitment to their cause or their activism			0
" the park and the occupation of the park is a tactic , it 's not the movement , " she said , calling the camps " a really important symbolic statement			2
" " if we ca n't sleep here , that does not end the movement			1
" @entity3 is part of a larger activist surge that began last year in @entity92 and quickly spread			0
while the protesters have highlighted a number of causes , the overarching theme has remained largely the same : populist anger over what activists portray as an out - of - touch corporate , financial and political elite			1
demonstrators in @entity0 have been camping out in @entity18 since the beginning of october			0
there was a daylong confrontation december 4 when protesters erected a wood structure overnight			1
it was eventually removed , after being deemed unsafe			0

as guests arrived , they were forced to pass through occupy protesters			0
while police assisted attendees , demonstrators began throwing glitter			0
