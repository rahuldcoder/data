@entity0 -- @entity2 on a @entity4 committee rejected strenuous @entity6 objections in voting friday that @entity9 official @entity8 waived her constitutional right against self - incrimination at a prior hearing			1
the resolution was the first step in an effort by rep. @entity16 of @entity17 , the @entity2 chairman of the @entity18 , to force @entity8 to return to answer questions about targeting of conservative groups by the unit she headed			1
it passed on a 22 - 17 vote , with every @entity2 in favor and every @entity26 opposed , following an unusually vitriolic hearing			1
@entity6 accused @entity16 of a partisan witch hunt that threatened @entity8 's @entity30 rights , while @entity2 seethed at how @entity8 had first declared her innocence before refusing to answer questions on constitutional grounds at the earlier hearing			1
@entity16 's resolution is likely to set off a lengthy legal back - and - forth with @entity8 and her attorneys that could include her eventual appearance at another hearing , where committee members agreed she would again assert her 5th amendment rights			1
that could then lead to efforts to cite her for contempt of @entity47			2
@entity8 headed the @entity9 unit that targeted some conservative groups seeking tax - exempt status for extra scrutiny			1
disclosure of the targeting in an inspector general 's report in early may set off a political firestorm , leading to investigations by the @entity58 , congressional committees , the inspector general and the @entity9 itself			1
@entity2 grill acting @entity9 chief over targeting probe under subpoena to testify before @entity16 's panel on may 22 , @entity8 instead made a statement that declared she did nothing wrong , and then invoked her 5th amendment right			1
@entity16 dismissed her , but warned the committee might call her back			0
friday 's hearing was the first step toward forcing @entity8 to appear again			1
if approved , @entity16 's resolution would set the stage for requesting her to come back and testify because she had waived her 5th amendment right in the view of the committee			1
" i believe @entity8 waived her 5th amendment privileges , " @entity16 said			1
" she did so when she voluntarily chose to deliver an opening statement " that included what he described as " four specific denials ...			0
at the core of the committee 's investigation into this matter			0
" other republicans called @entity8 's actions an arrogant rejection of congressional authority			1
" @entity8 is in fact the poster child for thumbing her nose , a federal bureaucrat thumbing her nose at @entity47 , " declared @entity2 rep. @entity87 of @entity88 , later calling the matter " a showdown , really , in who 's in control of the government and whether we honor the @entity95			1
" @entity6 strenuously objected to the resolution , calling it a political gesture and asking for the committee to first hold a hearing on the legal basis for the finding that @entity8 had waived her constitutional right			1
rep. @entity107 of @entity108 said @entity16 's resolution would hinder efforts to compel @entity8 to testify if the matter ends up in court over an eventual contempt of @entity47 citation			1
" i think what we 're doing today will doom our effort to hold ms. @entity8 accountable , " @entity107 said , adding some democrats would have supported @entity16 " if you did it properly			2
" instead , " we have not had the meaningful , deliberate process that would give weight to our decision , " he added , calling friday 's hearing " a political process			2
" another @entity26 , rep. @entity124 of @entity125 , called the " back - and - forth political bickering " at friday 's hearing " an embarrassment			2
" he accused @entity16 of conducting " witch hunts " instead of seeking solutions to the problems at the @entity9 cited by the inspector general 's report			2
" these are the issues that the @entity138 people want us to focus on , not more partisan arguing and gridlock , " @entity124 said , adding that @entity16 's resolution does nothing to fix the improper targeting			2
@entity142 , the elected @entity4 delegate from the @entity0 , said she and other @entity6 agreed with @entity2 that @entity8 's testimony would be vital to the panel 's investigation of the targeting scandal			1
" i hope we can find a way to get to the real point , perhaps by offering her some kind of immunity , " @entity147 said			0
@entity16 responded that the committee first had to take the procedural step of concluding @entity8 's testimony from the may 22 hearing , which remained open			1
only then could the panel try to strike an immunity deal , he said			0
when @entity147 persisted in questioning @entity16 about the matter , he abruptly declared her allotted five minutes to speak had expired and moved on			0
in another sharp exchange , @entity16 argued with @entity6 rep. @entity162 of @entity108 over a @entity2 memo that included a request that it not be distributed to all of the committee 's @entity6 to reduce the risk of it becoming public			1
@entity168 asked @entity16 which members he did n't want to see the memo , but @entity16 avoided the question and cut him off , saying , " the gentleman 's time has expired			0
" @entity9 targeting scandal reshaped by new details " well , the gentleman 's excuse is lame , " @entity168 shot back			2
@entity2 have tried to maintain public focus on the evolving @entity9 targeting scandal , inferring it could reach to the top levels of the @entity184 administration			1
no evidence so far shows political motivation or any involvement from outside the @entity9 , according to the inspector general 's report that revealed the targeting and the acting @entity9 director appointed last month by president @entity184 to clean up the mess			2
both liberal and conservative groups were flagged by the @entity9 when assessing their eligibility for a tax break available to social welfare organizations			0
however , only conservative groups faced delayed processing and inappropriate questioning about political activity that would make them ineligible , according to @entity9 principal deputy commissioner @entity202 and a letter by @entity204 , the treasury inspector general for tax administration			0
@entity9 screeners used conservative - themed criteria such as a group using the words " tea party " on " @entity210 , " or @entity211 , lists to determine if groups underwent further review for political activity that would make them ineligible			2
another category of the bolo lists also had liberal - themed criteria , including the word " progressives , " but that category did n't set off the automatic extra scrutiny for political activity , @entity204 's letter said			0
under tough questioning thursday at a @entity226 hearing , @entity202 acknowledged that the different bolo categories meant liberal groups avoided the extra scrutiny cited by the inspector general that included processing delays and extensive questions perceived by conservatives as political intimidation			0
@entity202 repeatedly cautioned that his internal review was incomplete , and that additional information from continuing investigations will be needed to reach definitive conclusions			0
he noted that 80 groups that have waited more than 120 days for a final decision on their applications for a tax break represent a diverse range of political leanings			0
all involved in thursday 's meeting agreed @entity202 needs more time to figure out exactly what happened , who was responsible and why			0
that did n't stop republicans from criticizing his efforts so far			0
rep. @entity254 of @entity255 , the @entity226 panel 's @entity2 chairman , said @entity202 's report lacked accountability and reached unsubstantiated conclusions of no political motivation			2
" if there is anything this report shows , it 's just how much more work must be done , " @entity254 said , noting that @entity202 had yet to interview principal figures or get other information necessary to determine the origins or scope of the targeting			0
another @entity2 legislator , rep. @entity271 of @entity272 , called @entity202 's report " a sham			1
" @entity202 said the @entity58 and inspector general are handling interviews of @entity9 officials involved in the targeting , adding that the investigations could involve criminal behavior			0
he repeated the assertion in his report that no evidence so far suggests intentional wrongdoing by agency personnel or influence from outside the @entity9 in the targeting			0
his report , released monday , said five managers had been replaced and other steps were taken in response to @entity204 's audit last month that set off a political firestorm in @entity0			0
@entity2 leaders contend the targeting uncovered by the inspector general 's audit indicates political villainy by the @entity184 administration to try to stifle opponents , such as groups with " tea party " in their names that were flagged for additional @entity9 scrutiny			1
@entity6 said thursday that such allegations are politically motivated instead of based on any evidence			0
rep. @entity305 of @entity255 , the top @entity26 on the panel , asked @entity202 if there is any evidence of @entity4 involvement in the targeting , and @entity202 answered there is not			0
@entity1 's @entity312 and @entity313 contributed to this report .			0
