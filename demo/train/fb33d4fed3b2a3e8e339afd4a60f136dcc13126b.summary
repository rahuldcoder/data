-- it happened again sunday			2
a woman leaped from the third level of the @entity4 at a @entity6 football game			2
she survived the 40 - to 50 - foot drop when a @entity9 vet who happened to be leaving the stadium used his body as a shield as she landed			2
but others have not been so fortunate			0
every few months this year have brought reports of a fan falling -- sometimes fatally -- at arenas across the country			1
there have been several incidents this year alone			1
on november 24 , the day of the woman 's fall , a 48 - year - old man suffered severe head injuries after falling down steps at the @entity25 in @entity26 at the @entity28 game against the @entity29			1
on november 17 , a @entity31 fan fell as he tried to slide down the rail of the upper deck of @entity34 , dropping about 30 feet			1
he injured himself and a fan he landed on			1
on october 24 , a woman fell about 20 feet from the stands at @entity38 at a game at @entity40			0
on august 12 , a man fell about 85 feet from the upper level of @entity44 's @entity43			0
the death was ruled a suicide			0
the reasons so , why are these incidents happening ? there 's not a one - size - fits - all answer			1
in may 2011 , a man trying to slide down a railing at @entity53 at a @entity55 game fell and died			0
an autopsy later found marijuana in his system , as well as a blood - alcohol level more than twice the legal limit for driving			0
some are just tragic accidents			0
in july of the same year , a father fell to his death trying to catch a ball thrown toward him by @entity67 outfielder @entity66			1
the man lost his footing and fell over the rail at the @entity71 in @entity72 , as his young son looked on			0
the death prompted the @entity67 to say the team would raise the railings			0
it followed an incident a year earlier at the same stadium			1
in july 2010 , a fan fell 30 feet while trying to catch a foul ball			1
he fractured his skull but survived			0
' we 're just more aware of it ' is there an uptick in falls in stadiums ? " it 's hard to say , " said @entity89 , director of the @entity90 at the @entity91 at the @entity92 in @entity93			1
" from what we 've found , it appears it has gone up , " she said , citing her work going back a decade that is based largely on news accounts			0
she found three such incidents in 2003 and five or six per year since 2010			1
but , she added , the previous lower numbers could simply reflect underreporting			0
" they 're not going up , " said @entity104 , co-author of " @entity106 " ( @entity107 , 2009 ) and head of public services at the library at @entity111 in @entity112 , @entity113			1
" they 've been pretty common since the early ' 70 's , back when the super stadiums started being built			0
" fan falls to his death at @entity120 's @entity119 since 1969 , he said , 23 people have died in incidents at @entity124 games , with " only a couple " of suicides			1
in the " vast majority " of the incidents , alcohol was involved , he said in a telephone interview			2
@entity132 's @entity131 and @entity134 's @entity133 each had three such deaths , he said			2
a lot of the fatalities were n't falls from upper - level stands to lower - level stands , but were instead falls from stairwell railings , escalator railings and failed attempts to jump from one stairwell to another , he said			2
for a sport whose preoccupation with numbers can seem obsessive , numbers about deaths and injuries at stadiums are surprisingly tough to come by			2
a @entity124 spokesman said much of the league 's information is anecdotal			0
" we do n't have tallies or numbers going back historically , but we always follow up with clubs after such incidents , " @entity124 spokesman @entity156 said in a telephone interview			1
" we keep records on things that have happened in recent years , but no totals			0
" but he predicted that could change , now that the league 's security department has new leadership			0
weeks said he and his co-author , @entity172 , based their work on accounts in newspapers , which often ignored fan deaths caused by heart attack or stroke			1
and some of the newspaper accounts glossed over the details			0
" a lot of times , they do n't identify the person who was killed , " said @entity172 , who is head of reference at the @entity182			1
" but nowadays , with the @entity188 and @entity189 and that sort of stuff , this stuff gets spread around like crazy			0
i think we 're just more aware of it			1
" @entity195 falls from mammoth stadiums the size of the newer stadiums appears to have played a role in many of the deaths			2
" they build those mammoth ones , and there 's a lot more distance to fall , " @entity172 said in a telephone interview			1
the authors ' research , which extended to other venues as well , tallied more than 800 game - related fatalities of players , other personnel and spectators from 1862 through 2007			2
a second edition of their book will list hundreds more , @entity172 said in a telephone interview			1
some deaths at sporting events had nothing to do with falls , but were the result of colossally bad luck			2
accounts posted on the authors ' website detail such incidents , one of which occurred on july 31 , 1949 , at a game in @entity232 , @entity233			2
as play was beginning before a crowd of about 300 , lightning struck the chicken - wire backstop and raced around the infield			0
" there was a loud crack like a big whip , and a brilliant line of fire ran down the third - base line , " left fielder @entity239 testified , according to @entity172			1
" then came this awful thunder , and when i could see again , i noticed all our infielders lying on the ground , and people started running all over the field , shouting and screaming			0
" the third baseman , second baseman and the shortstop died ; about 50 others in the stands were shocked and / or burned			0
at least 30 players , including one minor leaguer , have died from lightning strikes , according to the authors			2
do n't sharpen your pencil fans know that baseball is all about timing , which could n't have been worse for one fan at an amateur game on october 25 , 1902 , in @entity267 , @entity268 : " @entity269 , 20 , was seated between @entity270 , who was scoring the game , and @entity272 , another fan			1
during the course of the game , @entity270 asked @entity276 for a knife so he could sharpen his pencil			0
@entity276 opened the blade of his penknife and handed it to @entity269 to pass along to @entity270			0
just as @entity269 took the knife , a foul ball struck him on the hand and drove the blade into his chest over his heart			0
@entity269 bled to death within moments			0
" @entity172 said he initially thought the account was apocryphal but was convinced that it was real when he found it described in the local newspaper			1
teams have been protected from legal liability for more than a century by the doctrine known as the assumption - of - risk rule , which holds that the dangers to spectators are widely known and that fans assume any risk , according to @entity172			1
he said that without the digitization of local newspapers in recent years , he and @entity104 would not have been able to complete their project			1
@entity172 said he is a big fan of the game but wo n't sit on field level along the third or first base sides when he takes his grandchildren with him			1
" it 's called the danger zone , " he said , citing those who sell netting			0
all deaths are not equal , he said			2
" when a player is killed , they call it a day ; when it 's a fan , they do n't stop the game			1
" @entity0 librarian @entity320 contributed to this report .			0

" i think we 're just more aware of it , " says @entity104 , author of " @entity106 "
players ' deaths stop games ; fans ' deaths do n't , co-author @entity172 says
is there an uptick in such incidents ? or are we just *paying* more attention ?
