-- the saga of @entity2 continued to energize thousands around the country monday , spurring demonstrations across the @entity5 and even turning what had been a regularly scheduled city commission meeting into a hot - ticket event			1
exactly one month ago , the 17 - year - old was shot dead in @entity10 , @entity11 , while heading back from a convenience store , where he 'd picked up a bag of @entity15 and an iced tea			1
the teen 's admitted shooter , neighborhood watch volunteer @entity17 , has n't been charged in the case , and his lawyer has said his client shot @entity2 in self - defense			1
yet the young victim 's parents , as well as their supporters , have suggested that the shooter thought their son was " suspicious " because he was black , adding that they feel local police bungled the case in numerous ways -- chief among them , by not arresting @entity17			1
newspaper report fills in some blanks about incident " do the right thing , arrest @entity17 now , " said the rev. @entity37 , in presenting @entity10 's city commission with a petition he claimed had been signed by 2 million people who urged that the shooter be detained			1
@entity37 joined @entity2 's parents at a trio of well - attended events monday in the central @entity11 city			1
the first was a noontime " town hall " forum hosted by @entity48 , a @entity0 contributor			0
after that , the parents spoke out forcefully in response to recently reported news that february 26 -- the day of the shooting -- their son was n't in school because he 'd been suspended for 10 days after an empty plastic bag found in his book bag had marijuana residue			2
family spokesman @entity60 confirmed the suspension			0
" the only comment that i have right now is that they 've killed my son and now they 're trying to kill his reputation , " @entity2 's mother , @entity62 , said at a news conference following that forum			1
the day 's most anticipated event was initially expected to be a standard city commission meeting			2
but in response to the public outcry -- and criticisms over the @entity77 's handling of the case -- city officials decided to focus the meeting on the incident			2
some waited in line for several hours for the chance to get one of 500 available seats in the @entity86			0
the meeting had been moved to there to accommodate a large crowd , but even then many hundreds were n't able to get into the packed hall			0
" i just want to reaffirm that we truly are in pursuit of truth and justice , and we 've looked outside our walls ( for help ) , " @entity10 mayor @entity92 said , referring to the city 's outreach to the @entity95 , the @entity96 and others to review how the case was and should be handled			1
" and we will take swift and decisive action , " @entity92 added			0
over the next several hours , several speakers allied with the @entity2 family took to the lectern demanding @entity17 's arrest , calling for city officials to take a stand , and criticizing how the police investigation was handled			1
" we 're not asking for @entity115 , we 're asking for justice , justice , justice , " said @entity114 , @entity2 's father			1
the parents eventually left and headed to a nearby park -- where the city commission meeting had been broadcast on large video screens -- for a rally scheduled for later in the day			0
the family had plenty of support monday , and not just in @entity10			2
in communities big and small , people wore hooded sweatshirts -- hoodies -- and carried skittles and iced tea -- just as @entity2 had done on the night of his death -- as they called for @entity17 's arrest , legislative changes and an end to racial profiling			2
share your pictures or video from one of these events they included throngs of people who marched on streets in front of the @entity147 in @entity148 , decrying a " stand your ground " law in that state -- as in @entity11 -- that allows people to use force in self - defense			1
more than 2,100 miles away in @entity157 , others held up signs reading , " we demand justice			2
" similar scenes played out in @entity161 , @entity162 ; @entity163 ; @entity164 ; @entity165 ; and places in between			0
majority in poll say shooter should be arrested in @entity171 , speakers organized by the @entity170 lined up , one by one , to grab a bullhorn and demand a " conviction " of @entity17			0
when protesters agreed with a speaker , they shook their bags of @entity15			0
demonstrators there said they believed race was a factor in @entity2 's death at the hands of @entity17 , who is a white @entity183			1
" if this had been a brother , he 'd be on death row ! " one protester shouted , referring to @entity17			0
@entity188 , an @entity189 mother of a 7 - year - old boy , delivered to the @entity95 a printout copy of an online petition with over 500,000 digital signatures to demand that agency take action			0
" we want a conviction , we want an arrest , and we want it now , " @entity188 said			0
@entity0 's @entity199 and @entity200 contributed to this report .			0
