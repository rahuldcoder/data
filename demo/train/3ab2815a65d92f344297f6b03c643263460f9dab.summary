" the @entity6 may have silenced some of them on thursday			2
the venerable news outlet announced that 100,000 people had signed up for digital subscriptions in the first month since they were offered			2
the @entity6 erected a pay wall on its site march 28 , forcing readers to subscribe if they wanted to click on more than 20 articles per month			2
the digital plans range from $ 15 to $ 35 for four weeks of access , depending on which device you want to read the articles on			1
an early promotion let subscribers pay 99 cents per week			0
so , 100,000 new digital subscriptions in four weeks for the nation 's third - largest newspaper -- is that an impressive figure ? " if you 're the @entity6 , no , " said @entity26 , an analyst for @entity27			1
" the @entity6 is the @entity29 of the journalism world , " he added			1
@entity26 believes that @entity32 - only subscription rate could be hard for the @entity6 to sustain and grow			1
" there 's no virtuous cycle in a subscription business like this , " he said			0
" over time , the sales are actually going to get harder than easier			0
" by june 30 , the @entity6 will start giving @entity29 30 % of revenue from users who sign up for a subscription via its app on the @entity42 or @entity43 , said @entity44 , a spokeswoman for the news organization			1
as of last month , the @entity6 ' app for @entity29 devices had been downloaded 7.8 million times , she said			1

" you have a business still whose core revenue model is changing dramatically , " @entity26 said			0
" you 're talking about a company that is half advertising - based , half subscription - based			0
" the newspaper 's circulation and its subscription revenue have fallen while newsprint costs have risen			1
that 's despite online postings from a few outspoken cost crunchers who discovered that it 's cheaper in some cases to subscribe to the paper 's sunday print edition , which comes with free digital access , than to buy a digital - only plan .			2
