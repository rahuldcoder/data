-- feet stumbling in the pitch darkness over the uneven ground we make our way with a group of women to one of the bathrooms in the @entity11 camp			1
" there is no light , if we come in here there could be a guy hiding or something			2
none of them want to be identified			2
they carry fear of the regime with them , even as they seek refuge across the border in @entity28			1
but " safety " is a relative term			2
for @entity33 's female refugee population , it has meant trading fear of death in their homeland for fear of something many consider to be worse : rape			1
there have been various stories of sexual harassment and rape in @entity45 -- teeming with masses who continue to stream across the border			1
this dark underbelly of crisis has led to a disturbing growing phenomenon : " sutra " marriages , or marriages for protection			1
families who feel like they are unable to safeguard their female family members , their daughters , are marrying them off to protect them			1
in a culture where conserving honor is central , everyone says they had no other choice			2
in one trailer we meet 13 - year - old @entity65			2
she curls back in the corner next to her husband , 19 - year - old @entity68 , and her mother , hardly saying a word			2
@entity65 is the youngest of three , her two older sisters in their late teens are also recently married			2
" i swear i was n't able to sleep , i was afraid for the girls			1
" her mother tells us			2
" i swear to @entity75 , i would not have let her get married this young if we were still in @entity33			1
" " there were rapes , " @entity68 adds			2
we approach the culturally delicate subject of sex with a vaguely worded question about the age difference and plans for children			2
" it 's okay , i do not want children now , " @entity68 says			1
" i will make it up to her , i will make up for not having a ( wedding ) party			2
" @entity89 dresses brides inside @entity11 -- a business she had back home in @entity33			1
she says that marriage at 13 was rare in @entity33 , but here she sees it more and more frequently			1
across the board , even for what should be a joyous occasion there is always sorrow			0
when the brides are children themselves , it 's even worse			1
" i feel like i have a child between my hands and she is having to take on a responsibility bigger than she is			0
" i feel like her life is over , her life is ending early			0
" the same fears exist for those families living outside the camp			1
on a tour with the @entity114 ( @entity114 ) we meet 14 - year - old @entity115			0
she has such a sweet young face , flushed with exhaustion as she cradles her baby			0
" i would n't have gotten married , it 's because of the situation			1
" she speaks softly , her eyes filled with regret and pain well beyond her years			0
" i told my son not to consummate the marriage , but he did n't listen , " her mother - in - law whispers			1
she too was wed for protection			1
more : forced to marry at age 14 @entity130 , herself a @entity33 refugee and @entity114 volunteer , estimates there has been an increase of 60 % in young teen marriages			1
the added worry not just because of the young age of the girls , but medical as well			0
many are having children before their own bodies are fully developed			0
the @entity114 team goes house to house in @entity147 and other areas of @entity28 trying to determine what aid refugees need , but also to pinpoint vulnerable cases			1
one woman we meet has 13 children			0
two of her daughters are teenagers and she 's so afraid of leaving them at home alone that she has n't been able to leave the house to vaccinate her baby			1
despite their best efforts , @entity33 's neighbours like @entity28 ca n't handle the influx of refugees			1
aid organizations are running out of funding			0
more : saying no to child marriage predators also lurk in areas where refugees are known to gather looking for humanitarian aid			0
their desperation is palpable , with aid agencies both local and international unable to meet the needs , and they will latch on to anyone who promises help			2
@entity176 and her 10 - year - old daughter were at a hospital providing free care for refugees when she overheard a man on the phone talking about free housing for refugees			0
she and the other women there clamored around him , thinking their prayers had been answered			0
the man loaded three cars with women , including @entity176 and her daughter			0
she quickly felt that something was wrong			0
at their destination , a house in the city of @entity195 , a 45 - minute drive from the capital , she refused to enter			0
another man came out , and pointing to her , told the driver , she recalls him saying : " why did you bring me this one ? you brought me an old lady			0
then he pointed to the other ladies and asked , ' are you married ? ' " @entity176 began to feel increasingly terrified as she began to piece together exactly what this house was and asked the man for a glass of water , leaving her alone on the patio			0
she peered through the window			0
" all the girls were scantily dressed			0
" she remembers , her hands twisting nervously			0
" and i saw two men come in and pick two girls and walk out			0
" horrified , she managed to flee with her daughter and the other women with her			0
the international community may be unwilling or unable to end the conflict in @entity33			1
but there is a solution to preventing the exploitation of the @entity33 female refugee population : more aid			1
" we left @entity33 to escape death and we found something worse than death " @entity176 says , hugging her daughter close			1
" if we had stayed in @entity33 to die it would have been more honorable			1
there death is fast , here it is slow			0
" more : child bride : ' i was sold for $ 1,000 how to help : combat child marriage and barriers to education			0
