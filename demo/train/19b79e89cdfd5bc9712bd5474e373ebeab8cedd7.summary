the court issued warrants for their arrests			0
@entity6 and @entity30 are signatories to the @entity55 , meaning they recognize the court 's authority			1
in august , @entity30 's foreign minister @entity59 announced that his country was recognizing the rebels ' @entity61 as @entity1 's government			2
when asked what would happen if @entity9 came to the country , @entity59 responded that @entity9 could come , but that the government would respect its @entity38 obligations , @entity34 said			1
the @entity68 has called on its member states -- which include @entity30 -- to refuse the @entity38 arrest warrants			1

" an @entity68 representative could not be reached immediately on tuesday			0

@entity88 , chief negotiator for the @entity61 , said tuesday a convoy left the @entity91 stronghold of @entity92 three days ago			1
" we believe that @entity40 was part of that convoy , " @entity88 said			0
@entity95 said tuesday that while it " continuously receives reports " about weapons , vehicles and even convoys of vehicles moving throughout @entity1 , " we do not discuss the intelligence and surveillance information we collect			0
" " to be clear , our mission is to protect the civilian population in @entity1 , not to track and target thousands of fleeing former regime leaders , mercenaries , military commanders and internally displaced people , " a @entity95 official said in an e-mailed statement			0
on monday , @entity9 spokesman @entity110 told @entity111 by phone that @entity9 was " in excellent health " and that " no one will be able to know where he physically is			0
" meanwhile , representatives of @entity1 's transitional leadership met with tribal leaders in @entity92 tuesday to reiterate that @entity91 forces will not be harmed if they surrender peacefully			0

for more than six months , @entity1 have demanded democratic reforms and an end to @entity9 's 42 - year rule			2
the unrest exploded into a civil war , and @entity9 's regime crumbled after @entity149 fighters stormed the capital of @entity0 in late august			2
@entity9 's wife , two of his sons and other relatives fled to @entity154 recently , deepening mistrust between the new @entity1 leadership and its neighbor			2
