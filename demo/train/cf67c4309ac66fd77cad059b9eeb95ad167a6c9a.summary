-- @entity2 's star soccer clubs have booked a summer holiday to the @entity4 -- but this is strictly business not pleasure			1
@entity7 , @entity8 , @entity9 , @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 are among the footballing giants crossing the @entity14			1
these pre-season tours of @entity16 are nothing new but the timing could not be better			2
@entity2 's big clubs are coming to tap into a zeitgeist that has seen a new ardor for soccer sweep the country			1
since @entity24 's heroics at the @entity25			1
" it 's the perfect time to go , " @entity11 manager @entity26 -- whose team are making the trip for a one - off game against the @entity30 saturday -- told the club 's @entity32 channel			0
" it is the first time since i ( started to ) go to @entity37 that i 've been stopped by so many @entity39 people			0
" i can tell you something i 'm completely convinced of -- before people did n't know who you were , but now every @entity39 guy i met knows @entity11 , knows @entity45 and knows the @entity46			0
" this summer 's football fiesta in @entity48 certainly fanned the flames of soccer in the @entity4			1
@entity24 's draw against @entity52 in the group stages became the most - watched soccer game in @entity4 history when it attracted 25 million television viewers , according to @entity59 figures			1
those statistics put soccer ahead of baseball 's @entity63 average of 15 million viewers on @entity66 while the @entity67 delivered a similar figure for @entity69			2
even after the @entity4 team 's dramatic extra-time defeat to @entity72 in the last 16 , which attracted 23 million viewers , the tv audience stayed tuned			2
a new record of an estimated 26.5m fans watched the final between @entity78 and @entity79			0
" a lot of people still ask ' when is soccer going to make it in the @entity4 ? ' i think it has , " @entity80 , a fan from @entity81 who traveled to watch the @entity4 team at the @entity25 , told @entity0			1
" compared to 2010 , we saw significant interest the very moment the tournament kicked off and then a swelling interest as the @entity4 progressed through the group and elimination stages			2
" at the @entity25 in @entity48 the @entity4 had a home field advantage because there were so many @entity39 fans at the games			1
" on social media the followers and likes for @entity99 ( @entity99 ) has grown hugely and @entity101 held viewing parties in @entity103 that were so big they had to move them to @entity105 ( home of the @entity107 team @entity106 )			0
" with memories of the @entity25 final still fresh , @entity109 clubs are landing on @entity4 shores this week to stoke the glowing embers			1
@entity118 winners @entity8 , of @entity119 , @entity115 clubs @entity7 , @entity116 and @entity12 join @entity121 giants @entity10 , @entity122 and @entity123 as well as @entity125 side @entity124 in making a transatlantic trek			1
they are across the pond to vie for the @entity128 with matches played on the road from the @entity131 in @entity132 to @entity134 's @entity133 @entity136 champions @entity9 and @entity46 side @entity137 are among other clubs hitching their wagons to road trips across the @entity4 " there have been three ages of overseas football tours , " professor @entity141 , founder and director of the @entity143 and a professor at @entity145 , explained to @entity0			1
" firstly , tours were about easing players back into the football season after the summer break ; then , they became @entity154 vehicles for clubs seeking to build profile and presence around the world			0
" but we are now in the third age , where strategic development of key target markets and long - term fan engagement are important			0
" the short - term financial gains are likely to be less important than the long - term value of playing such matches			0
" if an @entity39 becomes a lifetime @entity12 fan following a tour game , the lifetime flow of income from them is potentially very significant for a club			0
" the incentives for the touring clubs might be obvious but these habitual pre-season tours interrupt the regular @entity99 season , which unlike the domestic leagues in @entity2 , runs from march through october			1
with @entity2 's finest flaunting some of the world 's biggest names , is there any danger that these high - profile tours are in danger of inhibiting the domestic game ? " you could say on one hand it 's a distraction because it 's in season and that these teams need to focus on their domestic season , " adds @entity80 , who is also the founder of the @entity187 which aims to build @entity39 soccer through social events			1
" you would n't see @entity12 or @entity196 taking time off in the middle of the @entity46 campaign to cash a check			0
" but it 's the unique position of @entity4 soccer that we have a different season and a unique position that we need the profile of the global leagues to increase the local one			1
it 's a double edged sword			0
" @entity210 from @entity211 , who organize high performance training camps and manage players ' affairs , thinks @entity99 simply ca n't compete with @entity109 football			0
but , as she told @entity0 , there is a silver lining : " i believe most of the @entity99 franchises are doing all of the right things to maximize attendance and brand recognition because no one does that better in sport than @entity39 clubs			0
" i believe this @entity25 has been somewhat of a game changer -- at least in the short term -- for football as i can not remember such a high level of patriotism and overall interest from @entity4			1
" @entity210 believes the loosening of @entity99 's designated player rule , which allows franchises to sign stars that would ordinarily be outside their salary cap , is vital in helping it attract valuable expertise			0
" so long as the @entity99 can expand the @entity239 rule and get more players out here , and coaches and trainers , who will make the @entity39 's better players in the long run , there 's no reason we ca n't produce a @entity248			0
" many of the @entity25 stars may well be on show on @entity4 shores in the coming weeks			1
the @entity254 game against @entity9 in @entity255 on 6 august will pit @entity39 @entity25 heroes @entity257 , @entity258 , @entity259 , @entity260 and @entity261 against some of @entity78 's @entity25 winners including goalkeeper @entity264 and midfielder @entity265			2
@entity9 , winners of the @entity136 @entity267 , also boast @entity4 attacker @entity268 in their ranks			0
he became the @entity24 's youngest @entity25 scorer after his goal in the defeat to @entity72			2
attracting players of this quality to the @entity99 regular domestic league is arguably the key to driving the @entity4 domestic league to a level closer to its global counterparts			2
" @entity99 is on its way with big names like @entity4 internationals @entity260 and @entity261 coming over , " @entity280 , who traveled to watch @entity24 at the @entity25 in @entity48 on her honeymoon with new husband @entity282 , told @entity0			1
" it 's tough because there are some good names playing here but it 's often players at the end of their careers			0
" if we got some @entity109 or @entity39 players who were in their prime they could help to bring the @entity99 to global standards			0
" @entity80 agrees : " it 's easy to be cynical about these tours in the short - term and say the @entity109 teams are just here for a pay day but from an @entity39 perspective i see it as inspirational			2
" seeing clubs with such a rich history allows us as @entity4 to dream big			2
" someday i want my local @entity39 soccer team to have the same international respect as a @entity12			0
" it 's a worthy goal to think that @entity99 can one day be on a par with the @entity46 , @entity312 , the @entity267 and @entity313 " the @entity109 visitors may well cash in on its imports this summer but , over time , it could be the @entity4 who is exporting soccer back to the world .			1
