-- few things distract from the discomfort of flying better than a decent roster of films on the seatback in front of you			0
as technology progresses , however , those imbedded screens may soon go the way of the dinosaurs			0
the question is , will passengers be better off for it ? at the annual @entity16 in @entity17 next week , exhibitors will showcase the latest innovations in the aviation industry			0
front and center is @entity22 , an in - fight internet provider that has recently added live tv and video - on - demand to the list of services it offers airlines			1
rather than tune in to a seatback consol , passengers stream the content directly to their personal devices			1
" you 're going to see a lot more cases where airlines will opt not to invest in an imbedded in - fight entertainment system , and will say , ' let @entity42 or @entity43 do the investment , ' in terms of letting people bring in their own devices , " says @entity35 , ceo of @entity36 ( of which @entity22 is a subsidiary )			1
row 44 has been nominated for a @entity49 for its work with @entity51 , which last year became the first in the world to stream live television directly to passengers ' @entity56 - enabled devices			1
previously , @entity51 did n't have any form of in - flight entertainment			1
says @entity60 , a spokeswoman for @entity51 : " not only did we save on the expense of installation and maintenance of seatbacks , but we 're saving fuel by avoiding the added weight of the tv hardware			1
" understandably , letting passengers bring their own devices on board is an attractive notion to low - cost carriers			2
in 2011 , @entity73 became the first @entity75 airline to offer customers @entity76 for in - fight entertainment			1
like @entity51 , they previously had no system in place			2
" if you want to design something in your front seat , you have to go through a rigorous certification process , " explains @entity82 , @entity73 's vice president of corporate communications			0
" you have to design it , produce it , install it ; it takes years and it takes millions			0
by the time it 's certified and installed , it 's already old			0
" by comparison , he notes , portable devices " can be put up fairy quickly , and can be changed quickly without a big investment			0
" read more : airlines cash in as @entity56 takes off unlike the many airlines that have since followed suit ( @entity103 , @entity104 , @entity105 and @entity106 , to name a few ) , @entity73 ultimately dropped the program			0
originally , they handed out the devices for free to business class customers , and rented them out for â ‚ ¬ 9 ( $ 11.55 ) to those in economy			2
" we believe our airline is like a travel megastore , and as a result , we 're not into amenities ; we 're into products and services that we can make money out of , " admits @entity82 , adding , " we found that there was a very small , but negative gain from stocking the product			0
" @entity73 seems to be atypical ; @entity51 , which charges passengers $ 5 to enjoy live tv , has witnessed an uptick in their revenue ( though they declined to disclose how much )			1
any increase is impressive considering the service was only rolled out on a handful of planes , and had received no marketing			0
furthermore , live tv has proved particularly popular with sports junkies , many of whom would have to otherwise make a tough choice between catching a game and booking a flight			1
anticipating this , @entity22 has worked out a deal with @entity140 's @entity139 , allowing passengers to never miss a game			0
" there was a popular game between the @entity145 and @entity146 at the start of the season , " recalls @entity35			0
" live tv was only available on 25 planes , and not many passengers knew about it , and we still had 600 viewers			1
football games last about three hours -- longer than the actual flight -- and still passengers were willing to pay to watch a game they knew they would n't catch the end of			2
" some carriers , however , are happy to throw out @entity76 and live tv as an added perk			1
@entity164 , which has long prided itself on amenities , last month started offering live tv to all passengers on its @entity168 , partly to promote @entity169 1 , of which the airline is a prominent sponsor			1
similarly , @entity171 , another @entity22 customer , uses its free @entity56 offerings as a means to win customers ( though they recently started charging for video - on - demand , which streams directly to passenger 's devices )			1

despite its many advantages , though , the content available to passengers on their own devices can be more limited than what 's available on traditional seatbacks			1
in the last few years , it 's become commonplace for airlines to offer what 's known as " early window " content , or movies that are still showing in cinemas			2
at the moment , airlines that rely on passenger - owned devices are forced to eschew this service			2
" at the end of the day , studios are always very wary of content protection , and making sure what content they do provide ca n't be abused or copied illegally " notes @entity205 , the director of innovation at @entity207 , a subsidiary of @entity208			0
" early window is high - value content , and they want to keep it in a very controlled environment , " he notes			0
@entity205 acknowledges that this could change in the future , but says it 's another example of why portable devices will never completely replace imbedded screens			0
" imagine a family of five turns up on a flight			0
what are the chances all of them will have an @entity76 ? you still need to entertain people who do n't have such devices on board			2

more airlines are using passengers ' own tech to deliver in - flight entertainment
@entity51 , which streams live tv directly to customers ' devices , says they save on fuel and hardware installation
live tv , @entity76 rental and video - on - demand are a few *tactics* airlines are using to *bolster* *ancillary* revenue
in some cases , the content available to passengers is more limited when streamed to their devices
