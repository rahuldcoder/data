he said the strike had killed many members of the same family			0
" even if there was a situation 100 % that these people were smugglers , these people should not have been subjected to this , they should not have been bombed			0
it is out of question , " he said			0
@entity131 promised a full investigation into the incident			0
the general staff statement released thursday said the military had received intelligence that militants were planning to attack border outposts following recent action against @entity8 separatists			2
