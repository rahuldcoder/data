-- it 's an all too familiar feeling for the high handicap golfer			2
the total mishit which instead of launching the ball to the heart of the green instead sees it barely leave the ground and end in deep rough			0
so when the same fate befell world number one @entity10 at least most of the large gallery following him friday at the @entity13 in @entity14 could empathize			1
@entity10 had been in a perfect position in the middle of the seventh fairway with a five - wood in his hand as he attempted to hit the green at the par - five hole with his second shot			1
but hitting the lush turf before the ball , his lame effort squirted left and into an awkward position			0
" he 's human after all " was the verdict of the tv commentary team and @entity10 's followers on social media as the @entity35 official website was quick to post the evidence			1
@entity10 could even afford a wry smile -- " a fat , low , duck - hook runner that was not intentional , " was his verdict after the round -- before normal impeccable service was resumed			2
from the tricky position in deep rough he conjured up a superb recovery shot to within a few feet of the flag			0
but the @entity48 , who has already wrapped up the race to @entity14 , failed with the putt to encapsulate a day of missed opportunities			2
he was just one - under - par on the four par - five holes on the @entity54 where his incredible power gives him such an advantage			0
@entity10 also found the water off the tee at the last , but like on the seventh hole , recovered to make his par for a two - under round of 70			2
it left him in a tie for second with @entity66 's @entity65 and @entity67 of @entity68 at eight - under , two shots adrift of defending champion @entity70 of @entity71 , who followed a first round 68 with a fine 66			1
" i just did n't quite have it , " he admitted			0
" i started to hit some better shots on the back nine and i 'm happy where i am two behind with 36 holes to play , " he added			0
@entity77 , playing his first tournament in six weeks , is bidding to end a triumphant season on a high note , having won two majors in 2014 and climbed back to the top of the rankings			0
a first round 66 had left him in the joint lead with playing partner @entity85 of @entity86			1
@entity85 also had an eventful round , acing the par - three 13th but also missing several other birdie opportunities to finish in a five - strong group at seven under			1
this also included @entity66 's @entity91 , who carded a six - under 66 , but like @entity10 could only make par on the final hole after finding the water with his opening drive			1
the tournament , which brings together the top 60 on the money list , is the final event of the @entity35 season with an $ 8 million prize purse on offer .			0

@entity70 leads at halfway of the @entity13 in @entity14
defending champion @entity70 two shots clear of the field
world number one @entity10 in three - strong group tied for second
