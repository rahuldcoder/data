-- alaskans and air travelers remained on alert thursday due to the rumblings of a more than 8,000 - foot volcano emitting a " continuous ash , steam and gas cloud " that already extends up to 60 miles away			1
the @entity8 noted thursday that the @entity10 volcano " continues to erupt , " with " fire fountaining " at its summit 8,261 feet above sea level			1
a resulting cloud that extends downwind 30 to 60 miles ( 50 to 100 kilometers ) moved southeast on thursday morning over the @entity15			1
it reaches an altitude of about 20,000 feet above sea level			0
" satellite images show persistent elevated surface temperatures at the summit and on the northwest flank , commensurate with the summit fire fountaining and resulting lava flow , " the observatory said in its thursday update			1
a lava fountain , the @entity27 explains , is " a jet of lava sprayed into the air by the rapid formation and expansion of gas bubbles in molten rock			0
" it typically spews lava 10 to 100 meters up , though it sometimes goes as high as 500 meters			0
remote but still connected to the @entity39 mainland , @entity10 is one of two volcanoes -- the other is named @entity42 -- that are on " watch " status due to heightened activity			1
they 're also both under an orange code that relates to how their rumblings might affect planes flying over their summits			0
both these alert levels are the second most serious out of four options , according to the @entity8			0
@entity53 was known thursday about @entity42 , which is on an island and not monitored with ground instruments like @entity10			1
two days ago , the observatory reported a 100 - meter - wide swath of lava reaching about 1 mile down its southeastern flank			0
" cloudy conditions " have made it difficult for satellites , and thus scientists , to assess its status over the last 24 hours			0
even so , the observatory continues to warn that " sudden explosions of blocks and ash are possible with little or no warning			1
" five climbers killed in @entity72 after deadly volcanic ash blast a @entity74 , short for significant meteorological information , advisory from the @entity77 remained in effect thursday around the volcanoes			2
after " eruptive activity " last year at the @entity42 volcano , @entity81 scientist @entity80 said 90 % of air freight from @entity85 to @entity86 and @entity87 flies over @entity8 's airspace , and hundreds of flights fly through @entity91 's air space daily			1
" we think of the @entity94 as being remote and desolate , " @entity27 scientist @entity92 told @entity0 earlier this week , " but when you come up to 30,000 feet , we are talking about 20 to 30,000 people there every single day			2
" @entity92 described @entity10 as " one of the most historically active volcanoes in the @entity100			2
" @entity42 is also " very active , " with its last large eruption in 2001			2
imposing central @entity103 volcano spews ash skyward			0

observatory : @entity10 volcano " continues to erupt , " with " fire fountaining " at its summit
a " continuous " cloud of ash , steam and gas extends 30 to 60 miles downwind
alerts are in effect for that volcano and another on the @entity94 range named @entity42
