an uncle of a @entity3 pilot captured by @entity4 in @entity5 and threatened with beheading has appealed to the terrorist group to release its prisoner			1
" it is in their benefit as well and the benefit of all us , " @entity12 , a former diplomat , told @entity0 on friday			0
@entity4 should set @entity16 free in order to gain more sympathy in the region , @entity15 said			1
" otherwise , they will get the anger of the whole people of @entity3 and the anger of the whole world , " he said			1
@entity4 had pushed @entity3 to bring a convicted terrorist , @entity26 , to the @entity28 border by thursday evening			1
the @entity3 did n't , so governments and relatives were still waiting friday to see whether @entity4 followed through on its threat to kill @entity32 , followed by the beheading of a @entity35 journalist , @entity34			1
another of the pilot 's uncles , @entity39 , said the family has n't received any information from official sources			1
and there has been no proof of life from @entity4			1
" but we hope he is still alive , " @entity12 said			1
@entity49 's father , @entity48 , made a similar appeal for his son 's release thursday , after the sunset deadline			0
@entity3 officials have said they are willing to swap @entity55 for the pilot			1
but @entity3 's key condition is proof that @entity16 is still alive			1
" at this point , we want to emphasize that we have asked for proof of life , and we have not received anything as of yet , " government spokesman @entity58 said thursday afternoon , about an hour before the purported deadline			2
the lack of proof of the pilot 's health is concerning , but @entity39 said the family had received some information from " unofficial sources " that was comforting			1
kidnappers are in a commodities exchange business , said @entity75 , a former @entity76 hostage negotiator			2
and " proof of life is part of this type of negotiation			2
" " the @entity3 have no business going forward until they get it			2
" @entity49 was captured after he ejected from his f - 16 jet last month near @entity83 , the extremist group 's de facto capital in @entity5			2
coalition warplanes and drones continue flying over @entity4 strongholds in northern @entity5 , looking for any signs of unusual activity -- perhaps a convoy moving toward the border with @entity28			2
" given the fact that @entity4 has executed every hostage that they have publicly produced on a videotape except one @entity99 hostage , it does suggest that @entity4 is not that interested in serious negotiations and is principally interested in the ability to get a lot of attention for its cause , " said @entity93 , @entity0 's national security analyst			1
the 47 - year - old @entity34 left @entity35 last fall , when his youngest daughter was 3 weeks old			0
his wife , @entity106 , who heard from his captors first on december 2 and most recently in a wednesday email with their " final demand " -- pleaded for his return			0
" i hope our oldest daughter , who is just 2 , will get to see her father again , " his wife , @entity106 , said			0
thursday 's deadline was the third that @entity4 set in less than a week			2
the wait began with a video showing two @entity35 hostages , @entity34 and aspiring security contractor @entity118			0
and an outrageous demand from @entity4 : a $ 200 million ransom from @entity35 within 72 hours , or else both captives die			2
the first deadline passed a week ago friday			0
@entity125 proof soon followed : an image of @entity127 holding what appeared to be a photo of @entity131 's headless body			0
" what it shows is that they are reacting tactically , " said @entity0 military analyst @entity132			0
" they no longer have a strategic plan			0
... they are just trying to get the best thing going			0
" days later , came a change in demands : @entity4 now sought the release of @entity55 , a female jihadist imprisoned in @entity3 for her role in a 2005 suicide bombing at a wedding reception that killed dozens			1
and if the swap was n't made , the group threatened to kill both the pilot and the journalist			0
wednesday night brought yet another deadline : deliver @entity55 to the @entity28 border by sunset thursday , or @entity32 and @entity34 would die			0
the relentless back - and - forth has raised hard questions about whether @entity4 is truly negotiating , and whether @entity3 made a mistake to try			1
" they are attempting to elevate themselves into some sort of status as a political movement and a state , " @entity136 said			0
" @entity0 's @entity167 , @entity168 , @entity169 and @entity170 contributed to this report .			0
