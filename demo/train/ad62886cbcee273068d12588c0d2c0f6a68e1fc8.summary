-- less than a week after @entity3 became the nation 's sixth state to legalize same - sex marriage , @entity2 state lawmakers on wednesday voted in favor of a bill that permits civil unions between gay and lesbian couples			1
the measure , which passed the @entity13 by a count of 21 - 16 , is widely seen as a compromise intended to provide same - sex couples with added rights and benefits , while also preventing an expanded legal definition of marriage			2
gov. @entity21 , an independent , is expected to sign the bill into law , according to his spokesman , @entity24			1
if signed , the law would take effect on july 1 , making @entity2 the fifth state in the union to allow civil unions between same - sex couples			1
such unions are currently permitted in @entity32 and @entity33 , and will be allowed in @entity34 and @entity35 beginning january 1 , 2012			1
three @entity36 states -- @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity39 -- plus @entity40 , also allow for " comprehensive domestic partnerships , " largely considered an equivalent to their civil union counterparts			0
despite robust opposition to the measure , @entity2 's @entity45 approved the bill by a vote of 7 - 4 , sending it to the @entity51 - controlled @entity13 floor where lawmakers voted in its favor , according to @entity13 spokesman , @entity54			2
the legislation , which passed overwhelmingly in the state 's lower house on may 19 , affords same - sex couples a host of new state tax breaks , health - care benefits and greater ease of inheritance			0
but it also drew sharp criticism from religious leaders and opposition groups who say it will lead to court - ordered action that would eventually legalize same - sex marriage			0
similar legal action in @entity72 and @entity73 resulted in those states adopting same - sex marriage laws , noted @entity76 , executive director of the @entity78 's @entity2 chapter			0
@entity21 -- who is supportive of potential legislation that legalizes same - sex marriage -- says civil unions are " a step in the right direction , " according to @entity24			1
meanwhile , gay rights activists -- like @entity85 -- say that while they support the civil union bill , they would prefer legislation that permits same - sex couples to wed. the group urged @entity21 not to sign the measure if it includes a @entity91 amendment that permits groups with religious affiliations to refuse certain legal rights provided to civil unions			1
for instance , a hospital with a religious affiliation could refuse a civil union partner from being involved in the emergency medical care decisions of their spouse if it chose to do so , said @entity103 , a spokesman for the activist group			0
@entity21 is " very aware of the concerns that have been expressed , " @entity24 said , but will likely sign the bill into law , which passed the @entity13 with the controversial amendment included			1
@entity91 spokesman @entity109 called the issue a " red herring , " pursued by the state 's more radical activists			0
the exemption , he said , is meant to provide religious protections against potential litigation			0
" it 's a small exception , " @entity117 said , when compared to the slew of new rights and benefits same - sex couples would enjoy should the measure be signed into law			2
currently , @entity2 and @entity125 are the only states in @entity127 that do not permit same - sex marriage			0
last week , @entity3 gov. @entity129 a signed a bill that legalizes same - sex marriage , more than doubling the number of @entity133 living in states that permit such unions			2
the measure will take effect on july 24 , providing gay and lesbian couples with new rights that include employer health benefits , easier inheritance and a host of state tax breaks			1
federal recognition , however , was not a part of friday 's vote , leaving benefits like @entity148 and ease of immigration largely out of reach for same - sex couples			0
the controversial bill passed @entity3 's @entity154 - controlled @entity13 before reaching @entity129 's desk , in an extended legislative session that left many skeptical over whether lawmakers would bring the measure to a vote			0
@entity160 and the @entity39 also allow gay and lesbian couples to wed.			1

new : if signed by gov. @entity21 , the law would take effect on july 1
