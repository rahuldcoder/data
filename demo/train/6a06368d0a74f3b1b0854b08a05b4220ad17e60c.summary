@entity0 -- whatever the literary merits of @entity6 's new novel , the @entity3 author is unlikely to earn many plaudits for the originality of her subject matter			1
have you read it yet ? share your review ? with a plot examining social tensions and class divisions between the rich and poor residents of an @entity18 village , " @entity26 " is a modern take on themes that have provided fertile inspiration for dramatists , novelists and satirists of @entity18 manners since at least the 17th century			1
muggle moms await first adult @entity6 book " we 're a phenomenally snobby society and it 's such a rich seam , " @entity6 said in an interview with @entity31 newspaper by way of explanation , in words that might as well have been attributed to @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 or any number of other female @entity40 writers			1
" the middle class is so funny , it 's the class i know best , and it 's the class where you find the most pretension			0
" still , @entity6 clearly has an authorial eye for the preoccupations of her middle - brow audience			2
@entity40 can sometimes feel like a country in the midst of a permanent , low - intensity class war in which all targets are fair game and all are left feeling routinely persecuted			1
while the wealthy and privileged are derided as snobs and " toffs , " members of the working class are grotesquely parodied and vilified as illiterate " chavs " and the middle class is roundly mocked , often from within its own fragmented ranks , for its petit bourgeois obsessions with house prices , farmers ' markets and amateur dramatics			0
@entity70 , the script writer behind lavish @entity72 - nominated period saga " @entity71 " complained last year that " poshism " was the " last acceptable form of prejudice " , while @entity77 , the well - heeled star of " @entity78 " said last month he had contemplated relocating his career to the @entity80 because " posh - bashing " in the @entity40 had gone too far			2
at the opposite extreme , @entity82 , the author of " chavs : the @entity91 of the @entity92 , " argued that the widespread blaming of last year 's riots in @entity0 and other cities on a supposed feral underclass was " classic demonization , reducing complex social problems to supposed individual failings and behavioral faults			0
" class , swearing and sex fill @entity6 's first adult book if @entity6 needed any further evidence of the enduring power of issues of class and status to raise @entity40 heckles , it came last week in the blundering form of @entity105 , a senior member of prime minister @entity107 's cabinet , whose job as chief whip is still in the balance over whether or not , during an altercation with a policeman , he called the officer a " pleb " and suggested that he ought to " learn his f * * * * * * place			1
" for critics of @entity107 's government , @entity105 's alleged insult and the fact that , like the @entity123 - educated prime minister and many of his colleagues , he attended one of the @entity40 's elite fee - paying public schools appeared to offer further proof of a blue - blooded conspiracy to keep the proles firmly in their place			2
as @entity136 wrote in the @entity138 newspaper : " in @entity105 's angry flash of social superiority ... we glimpsed the naked prejudice of the posh boys sitting at the cabinet table			0
the mask slipped to reveal how voters , the great @entity40 public , are viewed as inferior creatures , drones expected to know their place and tug a forelock at @entity146 rulers in their government castle			0
" yet there are good reasons , aside from unvarnished prejudice , why class remains such a potent political issue			0
for those worst affected by the present government 's austerity program , portrayed by opponents as an ideologically motivated assault on the founding principles of @entity40 's welfare state , the " we 're all in it together " mantra coined by @entity40 finance minister @entity161 -- the heir to a baronetcy and a multimillion dollar wallpaper fortune -- understandably rings hollow			0
class remains the single most important factor in shaping the life prospects of every single person born in @entity40 ; a fact most glaringly illustrated in terms of life expectancy itself , with men in the most deprived areas of the @entity178 city of @entity179 typically dying at 71 , while those in @entity0 's wealthy enclave of @entity181 and @entity182 can expect to live beyond 85			2
time : we read ' the @entity26 , ' here 's what we think at the heart of the @entity40 class structure still sits the @entity18 public school , the best known archetype of which is now probably @entity6 's own @entity191 -- a place of arcane rituals and @entity195 lessons , bunk - bedded boarding houses and @entity198 grandeur			1
real - life public schools may not offer lessons in magic and wizardry , but they do equip the offspring of those willing to cough up annual fees of tens of thousands of dollars with access to a world of privileged connections and a fast track via a well - oiled " old boys ' network " into lucrative and successful careers in the upper echelons of politics , government , the military , the judiciary , banking and business			0
about 7 % of @entity18 pupils attend fee - paying schools yet alumni of the top 100 public schools make up almost one third of annual admissions to @entity226 and @entity227 -- universities whose own peculiar traditions owe more to their archaic ties to those institutions than to the rigors of a modern , egalitarian education system			0
opinion : @entity6 's daring leap former public schoolboys even punch above their weight on our screens , with two of @entity40 's leading actors -- @entity242 , an @entity72 winner this week for his starring role in " homeland " , and @entity246 , celebrated for his portrayal of a rough - edged @entity249 - @entity80 detective in " @entity250 " -- both also alumni of @entity123			1
it remains to be seen whether @entity6 has anything novel to add to the class debate , but one thing of which she is undoubtedly aware is that it is a subject that will shift copies from the shelves in droves			1
as " @entity71 " and the entire careers of @entity260 and @entity261 have demonstrated there remains an insatiable appetite beyond @entity40 shores for the sort of cut - glass accents , excruciating social awkwardness and polite self - effacement that the country has turned into a thriving export industry			2
@entity6 , famously canny businesswoman that she is , will surely already have negotiated movie rights to a story that will be lapped up as eagerly across the @entity275			0
social class , swearing and sex permeate @entity6 's first adult book the opinions in this piece are solely those of @entity282 .			1

@entity6 's new novel , " the @entity26 , " is author 's first book aimed at adults
plot examines social tensions and class divisions in @entity18 village
@entity282 : @entity40 feels like country in midst of low - intensity class war
@entity6 is aware class is subject that will shift copies in droves , he adds
