@entity0 , @entity1 -- pope @entity4 has canceled a planned visit to a prestigious @entity1 university after a protest by academics and students attacked his views on @entity11 , the @entity3 confirmed tuesday			1
the pope had been due to give a speech at @entity6 in @entity0 thursday to open its academic year			1
however , the visit drew criticism from academics at the university who signed a letter demanding that the trip be called off			2
separately , students protested outside the university , carrying banners insisting the university is a lay institution and the pope is not welcome			0
" given the events of the past days regarding the visit of the @entity29 to @entity6 upon the rector 's invitation , which was scheduled to take place thursday , january 17 , it was decided to postpone the event , " the @entity3 said in a short written statement			1
father @entity34 , a spokesman for the @entity3 , confirmed to @entity2 the academic protests had prompted the cancellation			0
in the letter , academics -- pointing to a speech the pope gave at the same university as a cardinal in 1990 -- claimed he condones the 1633 trial and conviction of the scientist @entity11 for heresy			1
the astronomer had argued that the @entity48 revolved around the @entity49 , in contradiction to church teachings at the time , and he was forced to renounce his findings publicly			0
in comments made 15 years ago when he was still a cardinal , pope @entity4 is reported to have called the trial " reasonable and just			1
" during his speech , the pope -- then @entity4 -- quoted an @entity59 philosopher @entity58 , saying , " at the time of @entity11 , the church remained more loyal ( or faithful ) to reason than @entity11 himself			1
@entity65 , a physics professor at the university , said it would have been inappropriate for the pope to appear for the inauguration			0
@entity65 , who signed the protest letter and is the author of a book detailing the 1633 trial , said he is " very satisfied " that the @entity3 decided to cancel the trip			1
" we have no objections to the pope visiting at any other time when there can be exchanges of opinion , but not at the inauguration , " he said			0
" it was a mistake to ask him to come at this time			0
" @entity2 's @entity0 bureau chief @entity84 said it was quite extraordinary for the pope to cancel the visit just because of the objections of the students and professors			2
it is especially surprising , he said , given that this is the same pope that made a controversial visit to @entity94 last year			0
pope @entity4 went to the predominantly @entity96 country despite strained relations between the @entity3 and the @entity99 world following a lecture the pope gave at a @entity103 university in which he made unflattering comments about the @entity99 faith			2
