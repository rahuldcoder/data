-- shark attacks on humans were at the lowest levels in half a decade last year , and a @entity5 researcher says hard economic times may be to blame			1
fewer people in the water means less chance for sharks to attack , ichthyologist @entity7 says			1
sharks attacked 59 people in 2008 , the lowest number of attacks since 57 in 2003 , according to @entity7 , director of the @entity16 , part of the @entity18 on the @entity20 campus in @entity21			1
there were 71 attacks in 2007			0
" one ca n't help but think that the downturn in the economy played a part in it , " @entity7 said			0
fewer people , especially outside of the @entity29 , have the resources to go to the beach , he said			1
" to have a shark attack , you have to have humans and sharks in the water at the same time , " @entity7 said			2
" if you have a reduction in the number of people in the water , you 're going to have a reduction in the opportunities for people and sharks to get together			2
" " we noticed similar declines during the recession that followed the events of 2001 , despite the fact that human populations continued to rise , " the ichthyologist said			0
sharks killed four people in 2008 , @entity7 said : one in @entity54 , one in @entity55 and two in @entity57			1
forty - one of the 59 attacks worldwide came in the @entity29 , and 32 of those occurred in @entity5			1
@entity60 accounted for 57 percent of shark attacks , swimmers and waders were the targets in 36 percent of the attacks , and divers the rest , he said			1
@entity7 said the @entity29 tends to see more attacks because of a large number of surfers , who are a favorite target of sharks			2
and neither the economy nor the attacks tend to keep @entity29 surfers from practicing their sport			0
" all they have to do is drive to the beach with the board and get into the water , and the rest is free , " he said			0
and while an attack may make them a bit more wary , he said , " i 've yet to find a surfer who says he or she wo n't go back into the water after a bite or a nip			0
" when the economy improves , shark attack numbers are likely to go up again , according to @entity7 , predicting the number of attacks in the next decade will surpass those of the past 10 years			0
" we 're putting so many people in the water that humans are dictating the shark attack situation , " he said .			0
