-- on monday , a federal court struck down @entity3 's medically unnecessary law that singles out doctors who provide abortions and requires them to secure admitting privileges at a local hospital			1
the court called the justification for the law " exceedingly weak			2
" as an obstetrician - gynecologist , i could n't agree more			0
this decision is an important win for @entity16 women and for the practice of medicine			0
let me be clear : we all want women to receive safe medical care			1
but these laws ( a number of states have adopted them ) do not make women safer			2
in fact , they have quite the opposite effect , as they will make it harder for women to access medical care , potentially forcing them to seek abortion services later in their pregnancy			1
these laws also jeopardize women 's safety by forcing qualified physicians to stop providing abortions for reasons having nothing whatsoever to do with medical safety			1
that is why leading medical groups like the @entity44 and the @entity45 oppose them			0
whether a physician who provides abortions has hospital admitting privileges is not a reflection on the physician 's ability to provide quality abortion care			1
while hospital privileges in theory should be awarded based on physician competency , they in fact are often denied for reasons unrelated to the physician 's medical qualifications			1
for example , to obtain privileges , hospitals often require physicians to admit a certain number of patients each year			0
but doctors who provide abortions will likely never admit the minimum number of patients because complications are very , very rare			0
here 's what is important to remember : abortion is already extremely safe , and for the vast majority of abortions , hospitals do not need to play a role in the patient 's care			1
abortion has a more than 99 % safety record , with a less than 0.3 % risk of complications that could merit hospital treatment			2
more than 90 % of abortions in the @entity16 are performed in outpatient settings and almost all the complications that do arise can be treated on an outpatient basis			0
it 's one of the safest medical procedures performed in the @entity16 today , period			0
in the exceedingly rare event of a complication , women 's health centers have procedures in place to ensure that a woman gets the care she needs			1
admitting privileges -- or lack thereof -- do n't have any effect on a woman 's ability to receive emergency care if she needs it			2
in our modern care delivery model , emergency room physicians , hospitalists and hospital staff are trained to identify and treat all these types of patient situations			0
even procedures with much higher rates of complication and mortality , such as colonoscopy , are not subject to these burdensome requirements because it 's clear that they are not needed to keep patients safe			0
these baseless restrictions serve solely to prevent qualified , competent physicians from providing safe abortion care to women who need it			1
to put it simply , there is no medical reason to treat abortion providers any differently than other medical professionals			0
as the @entity3 court found , the law would have forced all but two health centers in the entire state to stop providing abortions			1
a similar law in @entity137 would force the last remaining clinic in the state to shut its doors , leaving women in the state with no place to safely end a pregnancy			0
similar requirements have devastated women and families in @entity146 and threaten to close clinics in @entity148 , @entity149 and @entity150			0
these laws are clearly not motivated by women 's safety , but by making access to safe , legal abortion difficult -- even impossible			1
monday 's court opinion recognizes that a woman is safest when she can make the decision about abortion with her family in consultation with her doctor , free from political interference			2
it clears one obstacle in the path of women -- and their doctors -- in @entity3			2
in states across the nation , legislators who truly care about women 's safety would do well to work to eliminate unfounded restrictions to abortion , instead of continuing to introduce them .			1
