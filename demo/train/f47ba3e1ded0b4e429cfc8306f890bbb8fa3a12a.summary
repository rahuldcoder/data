-- twenty - one @entity2 peacekeepers detained by @entity4 rebels this week could soon be released , representatives for the @entity2 and a @entity4 opposition group said friday			1
" all the parties " have agreed to a release of the 21 held since wednesday , and the @entity2 peacekeeping agency has dispatched a team to help collect them , @entity2 spokeswoman @entity7 said			1
but the effort was called off friday due to darkness , and the team will try again on saturday , @entity12 said			1
rebels had detained the peacekeepers , identified by the @entity19 government as @entity19 , in a @entity4 village near the @entity21			1
@entity4 opposition coalition president @entity22 said thursday that the rebels took the peacekeepers for their own safety due to fighting there			1
the peacekeepers reportedly are unharmed			2
the @entity29 , a @entity30 - based @entity4 opposition group , said friday that the peacekeepers are expected to be released between 10 a.m. and noon saturday in @entity4 , citing one of its rebel contacts			1
the release is contingent on a cease - fire between government forces and rebels around the village of @entity41 , where the peacekeepers are said to be held , the group said			1
government forces shelled the area friday , according to the @entity44 , the principal @entity4 opposition group			1
the rebels will hold @entity4 president @entity49 's regime responsible " for any harm that would happen to the @entity2 employees , " a statement from the coalition said			1
@entity52 , a man who said he was one of the peacekeepers told the @entity55 news network @entity54 via @entity56 that he expects to be released saturday			1
" the reason for the delay is the shelling , " he told @entity54			0
" we were about to be released this evening , but the shelling resumed			0
all 21 peacekeepers are safe and treated well			2
" @entity0 could not independently verify the authenticity of the interview			0
earlier this week , a video posted on the @entity29 ' @entity67 website showed six of the peacekeepers sitting in a room			0
@entity0 could n't immediately verify the authenticity of the video			0
in it , one peacekeeper gives a statement to the camera : " we are here safe in this place			0
we are here because while we are passing through position ( unintelligible ) to @entity81 , there were bombing and artillery fires			0
this is why we stopped and , civilian people tell us , for our safety , and distributed us in different places to keep us safe			0
and they give us good accommodation and give us food to eat and water to drink			0
" the rebels have said the peacekeepers entered the village near the @entity95 - occupied @entity21 , an area where peacekeepers should not be and where intense fighting has been raging for days between rebels and government forces			1
the rebels initially said they suspected the peacekeepers were trying to aid their enemy -- the regime of president @entity49			0
the @entity2 said the peacekeepers were on a " regular supply mission			1
" two other videos that rebels posted on @entity67 present the rebels ' point of view			0
in one , a rebel insists that the peacekeepers will be held until @entity49 's forces withdraw from the village of @entity81			0
the other video shows rebels walking near several @entity2 trucks			2
" this @entity2 force entered @entity41 village to assist the regime ... and ( the @entity2 is ) claiming that they are here just to stop the clashing , " a rebel says			2
members of the @entity124 condemned the detention of the peacekeepers			0
the unrest in @entity4 began in march 2011 , when @entity49 's government began a brutal crackdown on demonstrators calling for greater political freedoms			2
the protest movement eventually devolved into an armed conflict , one that has devastated cities and towns around the country and spurred more than 720,000 @entity4 to flee to neighboring nations , according to the @entity2 refugee agency			1
this story was reported by @entity0 's @entity140 from the @entity2 and @entity141 from @entity142 , and written by @entity143 in @entity142			2
@entity0 's @entity144 contributed from @entity142 .			0
