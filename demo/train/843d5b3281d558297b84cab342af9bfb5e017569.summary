-- the @entity1 gained sweet revenge for defeat in the 2010 @entity5 final by trouncing @entity6 5 - 1 in the opening fixture of @entity8 in @entity9 friday			1
@entity10 had given @entity6 the lead from the penalty spot after @entity13 was brought down by @entity14 before @entity15 equalized with a brilliant diving header			1
@entity17 then fired the @entity18 in front at the beginning of the second half before @entity14 atoned for his earlier foul on @entity23 - born @entity13 to make it 3 - 1 just after the hour mark			1
a horrible error from @entity6 goalkeeper @entity26 enabled @entity15 to make it four after 72 minutes and @entity17 burst clear of the @entity28 defense eight minutes later to round off the scoring			1
the result is @entity6 's worst at a @entity5 finals in 64 years and leaves little room for error in the 2008 and 2012 @entity36 champion 's remaining group games against @entity37 and @entity38			1
the @entity18 , meanwhile , will take great confidence having overcome the team that denied them in @entity42 four years ago			0
the @entity1 employed a physical approach when the sides met that night in @entity45 and there was much of the same during the opening stages at the @entity48 as the @entity18 pressed early , creating the first clear chance for @entity50 -- whose shot was blocked by @entity26			2
@entity50 was made to regret his profligacy midway through the first half after @entity13 was felled in the area			0
the striker , who was born a few hundred miles north of @entity9 and twice capped by @entity23 in friendlies , was roundly booed by many of the local fans in attendance for switching his allegiance to @entity6 earlier this year			2
@entity10 ignored the animosity directed towards his teammate from the stands , however , as he drilled his penalty low to the right of @entity66			0
@entity67 should have doubled @entity6 's lead shortly after being played through by 2010 match - winner @entity69 but the @entity73 midfielder 's delicate chip was slapped away by @entity66			1
moments later the @entity1 were level			2
@entity75 's floated long pass was met on the run by @entity15 and the striker launched a flying header that looped the ball brilliantly beyond @entity26			1
if that was a shock to the @entity28 system , worse was to follow six minutes in to the second half as the @entity18 took the lead			0
another blind crossfield pass found @entity17 galloping into the @entity28 penalty area			2
the @entity87 star displayed a deft touch to control the ball before stepping inside @entity90 and clipping it beyond @entity26			0
@entity92 then rattled the @entity28 crossbar with a ferocious strike from just outside the area , and five minutes later it was 3 - 1			1
@entity96 rose at the back post to bundle the ball over the line after @entity26 could not claim @entity50 's free - kick			2
things would soon get worse for the @entity28 captain			0
his terribly heavy touch following a simple backpass from @entity104 enabled @entity15 to steal the ball and slide it into an empty net to make it four			2
at this stage @entity18 fans could have been excused for believing they were dreaming			0
but more was to follow as a now ragged @entity6 was picked off on the break			2
@entity17 displayed his searing pace to streak clear of @entity111 after 80 minutes before rounding a despairing @entity26 and blasting the ball high into the unguarded net			2
@entity6 , well beaten , looked lost -- a shadow of the side which has dominated international football for the last six years			0
the famous tiki - taka style that has been the team 's hallmark throughout this golden period was rendered useless against a disciplined , well - organized and ruthless @entity18 side			0
substitute @entity121 had a late penalty claim turned down and then took too long to convert what appeared a simple chance from three yards out that would have reduced the deficit			0
the @entity129 striker 's ineptitude in front of goal summed up @entity6 's performance perfectly			1
" i did not expect that it would go this way , it could have been 6 - 1 or even more , and we had a very happy feeling , " @entity18 coach @entity133 told reporters after the match			1
" this is a nice start , but we have nothing			0
if we do not win our next game against @entity38 we have made no progress , but now we are obviously in a good position			1
" cutting a more chastened figure was @entity6 coach @entity147 who lamented his side 's performance but refused to apportion any blame ahead of wednesday 's next match against @entity37			1
" we must recognize our mistakes , but everyone fought for a better result , " @entity147 told @entity28 tv station @entity152 after the match			0
" i am aware that it is a very delicate time for us			0
together we have to try to solve it for the next match against @entity37 and look for the win			0
" @entity37 3 - 1 @entity38 a win against the in - form @entity162 is no certainty for @entity147 's charges			1
@entity167 's side looked impressive in spells against @entity38 , winning @entity8 's second fixture of the day at the @entity170 in @entity171			1
@entity173 star @entity172 opened the scoring after 11 minutes for @entity6 , pouncing on a loose ball to place it beyond @entity38 goalkeeper @entity177 from nine yards			1
@entity178 then made it two just over a minute later as he curled the ball delightfully beyond @entity177 with the outside of his boot from the edge of the area , having been teed up by @entity172			0
veteran midfielder @entity184 pulled a goal back for the @entity38 with a trademark header after 35 minutes , and the @entity188 player was denied by a smart save by @entity189 shortly after			0
@entity184 , who has now scored at three @entity190 , had another header rightly chalked off for offside in the second half , but @entity37 always looked the more likely to score again			1
@entity194 cleared off the line from @entity196 after the @entity198 striker had clipped the ball beyond the onrushing @entity177 after 72 minutes			0
substitute @entity201 then ensured victory in stoppage time with a low strike from 25 yards that flew past @entity177			0
while no doubt frustrated by the loss , the @entity38 can take some solace from the fact that @entity6 's earlier collapse against the @entity1 ensures it is the reigning world champions who prop up @entity8 after the first round of fixtures			1
@entity215 1 - 0 @entity214 in the day 's first fixture , @entity215 overcame @entity214 , the weather and some more questionable @entity5 officiating to win its opening @entity23 2014 fixture			1
@entity220 scored the only goal of the game just after the hour mark , rifling home after @entity214 goalkeeper @entity225 could n't hold @entity227 ' low shot			2
two wrongly disallowed @entity227 goals had earlier denied the @entity229 a halftime lead their enterprising performance deserved			0
thursday 's tournament opening fixture between @entity23 and @entity233 was marked by a controversial decision to award the host nation a penalty in the second half by @entity239 referee @entity238			0
but @entity220 's strike ensured any controversy would be avoided and @entity215 would triumph on a sodden afternoon in @entity242			1
the win put @entity215 second in @entity245 behind leaders @entity23 which triumphed 3 - 1 on thursday in @entity247			1
@entity214 , unimpressive and soundly beaten , is third above @entity233 on goal difference in the four - team group .			2

@entity1 wins 5 - 1 against world champion @entity6
@entity15 and @entity17 both score twice
@entity37 beats @entity38 in friday 's other @entity8 game
@entity215 defeats @entity214 1 - 0 in @entity242 in @entity245
