@entity0 -- it 's finally here ! no , not the post-christmas store sales or the impending @entity5 festivities			0
i 'm talking about the annual avalanche of " @entity8 " articles re-telling us about the " top " stories of 2011 : the @entity12 , @entity14 's death , the @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity18 's meltdown , blah , blah , blah			2
why does the media feel compelled to explain to us yet again the events that we all collectively experienced and were already covered ad nauseum just a few months ago ? i prefer that we focus not on the past , but on the events we wish had happened in the past year			2
or at least the ones i wish had occurred			0
of course , i 'm a comedian , so the events i hoped for may not actually be good for our country , but potentially they would have been great for comedy			1
so here are the top political headlines that i would have loved to see in 2011 : 1			2
" @entity30 gov. @entity29 forgets his first name			1
" who can forget ( except for maybe @entity29 ) the november 9 presidential debate when @entity29 famously blanked when trying to remember the name of the third government agency he wanted to eliminate ? i wish @entity29 had done this more often -- forgetting dates , statistics , maybe even one of the names of the other presidential candidates during a debate , forcing him to cover with lines like : " i have to disagree with the guy who has been married a bunch of times and has a really weird first name			1
" ( can you guess who i mean ? ) 2			0
" @entity50 goes on a national speaking tour			1
" vice president @entity50 is president @entity52 's " fat friend " who makes @entity52 look more attractive every time @entity50 opens his mouth			1
his penchant for putting his foot in his mouth is a bad trait for a politician , but as a comedian , i view @entity50 's speaking gaffes as @entity61 year round			1
@entity50 is the guy who thoughtfully remarked : " @entity65 rest her soul , " when speaking of the prime minister of @entity64 's mother			1
only problem was that the prime minister 's mother was still very much alive			0
and who can forget when @entity50 exclaimed at a campaign event : " @entity75 , @entity76 , let ' em see ya , " to @entity78 state sen. @entity77 , a man who uses a wheelchair			1
and earlier this year , @entity50 gave us even more comedy when he announced at an event in @entity84 : " senator @entity85 is here , wan na recognize him , i was told he was here			1
" which would 've been fine if senator @entity85 's first name was not @entity88 and if " he " was not actually a " she			0
" in 2012 , we need to get @entity50 out of the @entity90 and in front of a microphone as often as possible			1
" @entity93 agrees to trial by combat to resolve disagreements			0
" finally , something that is both potentially hilarious and could end the gridlock in @entity99			0
this battle could have taken place at the @entity103 theme restaurant conveniently located in nearby @entity104 , @entity105			0
there , @entity106 and @entity107 from both the @entity90 and @entity108 would have squared off in epic battle of steed and steel as they waged attacks on each other armed with lances and armor piercing maces to determine which political party 's agenda would be adopted			0
" @entity119 challenges every @entity120 to a $ 10,000 bet			0
" @entity119 -- fresh off challenging @entity30 gov. @entity29 to a $ 10,000 bet about his stand ( s ) on health care -- doubles down by offering to bet any @entity120 citizen $ 10,000 about any issue of their choosing			1
this could have been a mini-stimulus plan for many @entity120 families who might have prevailed on the bet			0
" @entity106 congressmen @entity133 and @entity134 remain in @entity93 and keep tweeting and emailing people			0
" these guys were both comedy gold but only while they were still in @entity93			2
@entity133 , of course , tweeted photos of himself partially nude to different people -- which on one level was the most original ( and comedic ) constituent outreach program in the history of @entity93			0
@entity134 's troubles were not as well documented by the media			0
this @entity147 congressman resigned because of a sex scandal but not before he had emailed to congressional staffers a photo of himself dressed like a tiger			0
if @entity134 had stayed in @entity93 , we could have been treated to him wearing even more costumes -- maybe @entity134 would have attended congressional committee hearings dressed like the donkey from " @entity156 " or even as " @entity157			0
" but alas we will never know the full comedy potential of these two because of their abrupt resignations from @entity93			2
" @entity29 makes even more horrible campaign commercials			1
" @entity29 's campaign ad opposing gays serving openly in the military may have statistically been one of the most " disliked " videos ever on @entity167 but it was loved by comedians			1
no ad ever featured such a bizarre mixed message : @entity29 bragging about his opposition to gay marriage while paradoxically wearing a jacket made famous by one of the gay cowboy characters in " @entity177			1
" i wish @entity29 would have done a new campaign ad talking about protecting the environment while dressed in a suit made of baby seal pups covered in oil			2
" @entity184 announces her candidacy for president of the @entity120 " this is the headline i most wished for in 2011			1
@entity184 has the potential to eclipse the golden age of political comedy provided to comedians by @entity191			1
her gaffes and missteps have secured her a place in the @entity196 political comedy museum -- which i hope to build one day			0
who can forget @entity184 referring to the fighting in @entity199 as a " squirmish " -- a word which sends my spell check into an endless loop			2
or @entity184 sharing her foreign policy prowess with the comment : " but obviously , we 've got to stand with our @entity209 allies			2
" and just a few months ago , she gave us this comedy classic : @entity211 warned the @entity212 during the revolutionary war			0
ahh ... i get a bit misty thinking about what could have been if @entity184 ran for president			1
do n't get me wrong , from a comedic point of view , 2011 was a pretty good year , but i think we all can agree that it could have been funnier			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity224 .			2

@entity224 says 2011 was a good year for comedy , but it could have been better
he says more forgetfulness by @entity29 and more *speeches* by @entity50 would have *helped*
his biggest *disappointment* : @entity184 is n't running for president
