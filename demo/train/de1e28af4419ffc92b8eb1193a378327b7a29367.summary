-- on @entity2 , even the best intentions can lead to disastrous results			0
that 's what happened to the @entity7 's @entity6 this week , when the football team 's attempt to reward their followers on @entity2 turned into a social media manager 's worst nightmare			1
it all began thursday morning , when the @entity6 tweeted they were celebrating reaching 1 million followers by thanking fans with " custom digital @entity6 jerseys			2
" the " custom digital jersey " was actually a photo of the back of a @entity6 jersey displaying a fan 's @entity2 handle where the player 's name appears			2
so if your @entity2 handle is , say , @ @entity25 , you got a tweet from the @entity6 account that included a photo of the jersey with @ @entity30 on the back , along with a thank - you note			1
but what if the @entity2 handle contains a racial slur ? the @entity6 did n't think that through			1
when a @entity2 user with the name @entity37 * * * * * ss asked for a jersey of their own , the @entity6 cheerfully responded			0
" @entity45 * * * * * @entity44 for helping with 1 million followers ! " the tweet said , along with the promised photo of a @entity6 jersey bearing @ ihaten * * * * * ss on the back			2
the tweet stayed up for about an hour , to the incredulity of those online who spotted it			0
soon after , the tweet was removed and the @entity6 issued an apology			0
the @entity6 ' fiasco is the second major social media fail we 've seen this week			1
comedian @entity54 , who is facing allegations of rape , learned that encouraging @entity2 to use his photo for a meme did not go the way he expected			0
although @entity54 has denied the allegations , people still mocked him by creating their own meme images that included rape jokes			0
