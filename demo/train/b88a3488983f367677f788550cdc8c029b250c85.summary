-- the undersea earthquake off the @entity4 island of @entity5 on wednesday was the largest earthquake of its type ever recorded and has increased the risk of more powerful quakes in the region , a leading expert has said			1
director of the @entity12 of @entity13 , @entity11 , told @entity0 that the 8.6 @entity15 undersea earthquake was the largest " strike - slip " quake - steep structures where the two sides of the fault slip horizontally past each other - ever recorded			1
" before that we thought that 8.1 was as big as they get , but this 8.6 quake was phenomenal , " @entity11 said			2
" it has been absolutely jaw - dropping and has caused a lot of foment among seismologists			2
" he said the quake had provided two new insights for seismologists			1
firstly , that strike - slip earthquakes , which are normally not as powerful as mega-thrust quakes where one plate runs underneath another , could be this powerful			1
secondly , that big earthquakes of this type could run as deep as the @entity41 's mantle , the viscous layer beneath the @entity41 's crust			1
" we are learning details about the nature of the ruptures , " he said			0
" what are the fits and starts of the fault ? how does the fault break ? " likening the tectonic plates to a group of 10 men holding onto an elephant with a rope , he said that pressure on the plates becomes greater as the struggle becomes unequal			0
" finally , when one of the guys slips and ca n't hold the rope what happens is that the nine other guys are holding his 10 % , so they have to add 10 % more effort to hold on , " he said , adding that when a further man falls the remaining eight have an extra 20 % of the force to contend with			0
" eventually what you have is a cascade of failures and the last guy has to let go and the tectonics win and the fault moves , " @entity11 said			0
" what we had in @entity5 between 2004 and 2007 was pop ! pop ! pop ! three great earthquakes ; 9.2 , 8.7 , 8.4			2
" he said that wednesday 's earthquake was likely to have increased the stress on the plate boundaries near @entity86 , increasing the risks of another major earthquake in the same area as the 2004 disaster			1
" there 's still one or two patches left to go , " @entity11 said			0
he said the past 10 years had been particularly seismically active , providing invaluable information to seismologists			0
" we 've really seen a revolution in our understanding of earthquakes in the last 10 years because of these earthquakes , " he said , adding that new technology and the speed with which information was shared had changed the landscape in understanding earthquakes .			0

@entity5 quake the largest of its type ever recorded
the 8.6 scale strike - slip earthquake has given new insights for seismologists
the quake was so large it extended beyond the @entity41 's crust to the mantle
he said the quake has increased the stress on the plates in the area
