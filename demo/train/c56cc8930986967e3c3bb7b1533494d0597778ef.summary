-- arriving for our interview in @entity4 this week , @entity1 seemed eager to be back on the campaign trail			1
fresh from his summer break on the @entity11 island of @entity12 , the @entity7 finance minister effortlessly slipped back into what has now become a familiar routine : fielding questions about the eurozone when asked if he foresaw any more bailouts , @entity1 said " no , no i do n't see , the problems are not solved but we are in a much better shape than we used to be some years ago			1
" he pointed to the falling costs of sovereign debt and lower budget deficits across the common currency bloc and ruled out any more haircuts on outstanding government debt			0
with @entity7 heading towards elections on september 22 , chancellor @entity27 is enjoying unprecedented popularity			2
her approval rating is 63 % -- more than double that of her nearest rival , former finance minister and now @entity34 leader @entity33			1
the chances of a @entity37 win may be slim			0

" i hope we will win , " @entity1 told me , then adding : " we have to fight [ but ] i think the general mood is in favor of us			2
" @entity7 's government is in a curious position of having to serve two constituencies : one it 's elected for and another over which it has no formal mandate but a lot of financial sway			1
as the dominant economy in @entity60 , @entity7 has been pivotal in helping to fund and direct troubled member states but its leader has to balance that with her nation 's reluctance to be viewed as the rich relative			1

" we do n't want a @entity7 @entity60 but we want a strong @entity60 and that means every member state including @entity7 has to increase its competitiveness			1
" that , he said was about each country doing its duty and ensuring it did " not to ask for more money by others -- that 's the wrong way to get a strong @entity60 , that 's the wrong incentive			0
" since @entity83 was granted its first bailout in 2010 troubled eurozone countries have been granted around 440 billion euros in financial assistance			0
the cash has been funnelled through the @entity88 , the @entity89 and the @entity90 in exchange for promises to rein in spending and debt			0
@entity7 , which has the deepest pockets , is on the hook for the lion 's share of the support -- and as election fever sets in , so has bailout fatigue			1
watch more : @entity101 : why we need strong leadership @entity1 reopened old wounds this month by saying @entity83 would need a third aid program , though when asked by @entity0 he would n't be drawn on the size of the offer , saying it was too early to speculate			1
however , @entity83 's finance minister @entity109 said the country could be looking for an extra 10 billion euros in aid			1
it 's a figure close to the 11 billion euro shortfall already identified by the @entity88 , whose 3 - year program is set to end next year			0
as part of a multi-pronged approach to contain the eurozone 's existential crisis , leaders have tried to shore up its financial sector by creating a banking union as well as a contingency fund for countries in distress			0
read more : @entity83 may need another 10 billion euros when combined with the @entity89 's commitment to " do what it takes " to protect confidence in the single currency , such actions may have averted the worst for now			0
but @entity1 is under no illusions that without coordinated budgets for the country 's using the single currency , the euro will always be vulnerable			1
i asked him if the move toward closer fiscal cooperation has left the eurozone more politically divided than it has been in its recent history			0
@entity1 told me problems arose if there not a solid fiscal framework , saying the bloc has " made a lot of progress			2
. to get better conditions , better rules for common fiscal policy			0
" one thing @entity1 can not deny is the benefits to the country 's legendary export machine from the weaker currency			2
thanks to its flailing adherents , the euro has been less strong than a deutsche mark would have been			0
however , @entity1 also pointed to the lower interest rates enjoyed by the countries in @entity60			0

yet up until now it 's a language that has n't dominated @entity7 's campaign literature , which has instead been focused on issues like creating jobs , wages and the housing market			1
of course the great irony is that while @entity7 may be looking inwards this election , the world is keeping its eyes peeled for its next move			0
just ask @entity7 's neighbors			2
they have relied on her in times of crisis , and they will also look to her for the path to recovery .			0
