-- a cold case detective working to identify eight bodies found in @entity4 's home in 1978 developed a new way to find other possible victims of @entity8 's most notorious serial killer			1
@entity4 , who worked as a contractor and part - time party clown , lured his male victims with promises of construction jobs , drugs , alcohol or money for sex , or by posing as a police officer			2
he was convicted in 1980 of killing 33 men and boys in the @entity8 area between 1972 and 1978 , but investigators always suspected he had more victims than the 28 found in the space beneath his house and in a nearby river			1
his dna was never added to the @entity30 's national dna database -- officially called the @entity31 or @entity31 -- because it did n't exist when he was put to death in 1994			1
@entity34 law did not provide for the dna of convicted killers not in prison after it was enacted in 2002 to be added			1
but @entity38 , @entity34 , sheriff 's detective @entity39 , who discovered vials of @entity4 's blood in the cold case file a year ago , also found a legal loophole that allowed @entity4 's dna and that of others to be entered into the database			1
man believed to be @entity4 victim found alive sheriff @entity51 hopes the new approach will give investigators around the @entity54 another tool to solve their cold cases			2
" this has the potential to help bring closure to victims ' families who have gone so long without knowing what happened to their loved ones , " @entity57 said			0
@entity39 learned that when the state executes an inmate , the coroner lists the manner of death as homicide			0
the law allows for the dna of homicide victims to be added to the database , the sheriff said			2
" after review , the @entity76 deemed this interpretation acceptable and @entity4 's dna profile was to be obtained and entered in @entity31 , " a news release from the sheriff said			2
the dna of two other executed @entity34 killers -- @entity81 and @entity82 -- have also been added , according to @entity84 coroner @entity83			1
the dna may not have qualified if these men had died of natural causes while waiting on death row , he said			0
computers have reported no matches yet for @entity91 , @entity83 said			0
but @entity39 's cold case work did lead to one of the eight unidentified bodies being identified a year ago			0
dna comparisons on the exhumed body of " victim no. 19 " positively identified him as @entity98 , who was reported missing in october 1976			0
@entity91 victim after 3 decades			0

a legal loophole allows dna of executed killers to be added to the @entity30 database
an @entity34 detective hopes @entity85 will reveal *additional* @entity4 victims
@entity4 was convicted in 1980 of killing 33 men and boys in the @entity8 area
he was executed in 1994 , before the national dna database was *created*
