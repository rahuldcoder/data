@entity0 -- @entity4 police arrested two veiled women protesting the country 's law banning face - hiding @entity9 burqas and niqabs monday , just hours after the legislation took effect			1
the arrests outside @entity13 in @entity0 were not for wearing the prohibited garments			0
police say the women were instead arrested for participating in an unauthorized protest			1
but the incident reflected the high passions the ban has incited among some @entity9			2
one woman who disapproves of the ban said no one forces her to wear the niqab , a full - face veil with an opening for her eyes , and she should be left alone			1
" i 've not committed a crime , " said @entity26 , who was not among those arrested			1
" i 'm walking peacefully in the street			0
i 've not attacked anyone			2
" the ban pertains to the burqa , a full - body covering that includes a mesh over the face , as well as the niqab			2
the hijab , which covers the hair and neck but not the face , and the chador , which covers the body but not the face , apparently are not banned by the law that has sparked a vigorous debate around freedom of religion in @entity4			1
" the ban does not target the wearing of a headscarf , head gear , scarf or glasses , as long as the accessories do not prevent the person from being identified , " the @entity48 said in a statement			2
@entity4 prime minister @entity56 last month defended the ban as being in keeping with national values			1
" the @entity4 lives in a bare - headed fashion , " he said in an official government newspaper explaining the law			1
the legislation was largely the product of internal @entity4 politics , with president @entity65 's center - right party seeking to defend its flank against a more hard - line right wing , said @entity68 , an associate professor of political science at @entity70 and the author of an upcoming book , " the emancipation of @entity74 's @entity9			1
" " it 's an unnecessary confrontation , " he said			2
" this is not an epidemic			0
" fewer than 2,000 people in all of @entity4 and its possessions wear the garments , he said -- a quarter of them overseas			1
the now forbidden garments are not popular among the @entity82 who make up much of @entity4 's @entity9 population			1
but the law should not be interpreted as @entity4 turning unfriendly toward the largest @entity87 population in @entity74 , he said			1
as its @entity87 population has risen over the past decade @entity4 has gone to great lengths to ensure accommodations for @entity9			1
a council on @entity9 faith helped guide changes such as increasing the number of clergy in prisons and the military and streamlining the approval of slaughterhouses to provide meat that adheres to @entity9 law , according to @entity68			2
and unrest among @entity4 @entity87 immigrants has had more to do with economics than cultural issues , @entity68 said			1
" @entity4 is not a bad place for @entity9 to live , " he said , predicting that controversy over the law would pass if @entity4 continued its commitment to supporting the needs of @entity9 to worship freely in the country			1
but such policies could frustrate @entity4 muslims , said @entity114 , a professor at the @entity115 who studies @entity9 in @entity4			1
" the @entity4 community has , of course , been upset at this new development even if many may personally be against the burqa , " she said			1
" they feel under attack one more time and resentful of the fact that they are not allowed to be both @entity87 and @entity4			1
" @entity127 , a blogger , is against the ban and says it is a woman 's choice whether or not to cover up			1
" i am free to do whatever i want and this is a choice that i want to make			0
and just because somebody does n't accept my interpretation of @entity9 or personally like it does n't mean that we can use laws to violate people 's freedom of expression and freedom of religion , " she said on @entity1 's " in the @entity133			0
" " people have to deal with my brain and who i really am and not judge me by my body , " she added			0
the law imposes a fine of 150 euros ( currently about $ 215 )			2
the person breaking the law can be asked to carry out public service duty as part of the punishment or as an alternative to the fine			2
it was passed in october but included a six - month period to inform people of the penalty before it went into effect			0
penalties for forcing a person to wear a burqa are part of the law , and they became effective immediately in october			0
forcing a woman to wear a niqab or a burqa is punishable by a year in prison and a 30,000 - euro fine ( about $ 43,300 )			0
forcing a minor to do the same thing is punishable by two years in prison and a fine of 60,000 euros			0
the government has called such coercion " a new form of enslavement that the republic can not accept on its soil			0
" activist @entity180 of the group hands off my constitution headed out monday wearing a mask and carrying a check for the 150 - euro fine			0
@entity180 's group auctioned one of his homes to provide money to pay the fines of any woman arrested for wearing the forbidden garments			1
" i would like to send a clear message to president @entity65 that we can do what we want			0
we have a constitution and everyone has to respect it , " he said			0
the @entity201 said the law does not impose disproportionate punishments or prevent the free exercise of religion in a place of worship , finding therefore that " the law conforms to the @entity182			0
" " given the damage it ( wearing the forbidden clothing ) produces on those rules which allow the life in community , ensure the dignity of the person and equality between sexes , this practice , even if it is voluntary , can not be tolerated in any public place , " the @entity4 government said when it sent the measure to parliament in may of last year			2
lawmakers have also cited security reasons for forbidding people from covering their faces in public			1
some @entity87 women support the ban , including @entity230			1
" when you wear the full veil , you do n't have the right to work , you do n't have the right to choose your husband , you do n't have the right to love , " said @entity230 , a @entity87 feminist			2
" you are totally in prison			0
what is the aim of our democracy ? what is the aim of our republic ? it is to protect			0
that is a new challenge for our republic today			0
" @entity249 , a columnist on @entity251 and @entity87 issues , similarly supports the ban and says she would like to see it adopted elsewhere			1
" i believe that the niqab dangerously equates piety with the disappearance of women so i support banning it anywhere , " she said on @entity1 's " in the @entity133			0
" " we 're talking about the disappearance of women , justified in the name of them becoming closer to @entity263			0
" despite the controversy , @entity4 people backed the ban by a ratio of more than 4 - to - 1 , the @entity268 found in a survey last year			1
some 82 percent of people polled approved of a ban , while 17 percent disapproved			0
that was the widest support the @entity274 - based think tank found in any of the five countries it surveyed			0
clear majorities also backed a burqa ban in @entity280 , @entity281 and @entity282 , while two out of three @entity283 opposed it , the survey found			0
@entity284 had repeatedly urged @entity4 not to impose the ban , saying it violates @entity287 human rights law			1
the @entity268 estimates that @entity4 has about 3.5 million muslims , or about 6 % of the population			2
@entity4 does not keep its own statistics on religious affiliation of the population , in keeping with its laws requiring the state to be strictly secular			2
@entity1 's @entity295 contributed to this report			0
