-- if the local grand jury brings no charges against police officer @entity3 in the case of @entity6 's killing , street protests in @entity8 , @entity9 , are inevitable			1
demonstrators angry about @entity3 's shooting of the unarmed black teenager in august already decry the grand jury 's secrecy and " lack of transparency			1
" but for those who believe that the grand jury procedure is some sort of cop and prosecutor conspiracy to trample the rights of minority citizens , a little background on this hallowed institution might be in order			1
although prosecutors are often accused of controlling grand jury proceedings , the institution was actually created by the @entity29 to provide a wall of citizen protection against overzealous prosecutors			1
it is a section of the 5th amendment of the @entity35			0
the colonists were tired of their @entity39 overlords ' abuse of law enforcement and were intent on making sure that ordinary citizens would have to approve indictments in any federal criminal case in the newly minted @entity46 democracy			2
the @entity29 agreed so thoroughly about the need for the buffer of the grand jury against law enforcement abuse that it was one of the least debated provisions of the @entity46 @entity53			1
@entity54 , @entity55 and @entity56 would surely be mystified that requiring a citizen review and approval of a criminal indictment would be considered a violation of civil liberties , as some protesters in @entity8 might believe			2
in @entity9 , bringing a case before a grand jury in a felony case is optional -- prosecutors could have chosen to conduct a probable cause hearing before a judge			1
although this would be an open proceeding , a single judge would be making the decision about whether to permit an indictment against @entity3			1
the prosecutor here believed that a decision of this importance should be left to the collective judgment of the citizens of the @entity81 grand jury , rather than a randomly selected judge whose motives could easily be attacked and questioned			1
members of the public often find the workings of a grand jury mysterious			1
in most states , the grand jury sits for a month or more , hearing snippets of many cases each day			1
the cases are presented more as snapshots than feature - length presentations			0
the prosecutor generally streamlines the case to obtain an indictment , if that 's what he or she wants , without revealing too much evidence , which would go in the transcript of the proceeding			2
this transcript will be turned over to defense attorneys and the prosecution has no desire to help the defense			0
grand jurors have the right to ask for additional evidence and even to ask their own questions , but most rely on the prosecutor to present the evidence			0
it is for this reason that a former judge once said " a prosecutor could get a grand jury to indict a ham sandwich			1
" this is quite true , because the prosecutor often becomes a trusted friend to the members of the grand jury			1
a lot of cordial off - the - record remarks unrelated to the case are exchanged , as is normal in any place where people work together daily			0
i , as a prosecutor , can remember the click of knitting needles as a grandmotherly grand juror worked on a sweater while awaiting the presentation of the next murder case			2
" is this a good one , mr. @entity138 ? " she would ask			2
my reply would be , " you 'll have to wait for the evidence			0
" make no mistake though , grand jurors often rebel and proceed on their own independent course			0
this happens particularly in high - profile cases like this one			0
in such cases , a wise prosecutor will present as much evidence as possible , revealing both sides of the case			0
knowing that the grand jury transcript may someday be released and scrutinized , he will seek to create a record that demonstrates fairness and objectivity in the presentation of the case			1
let us hope that this has been done in @entity161			0
but as in " @entity163 , " the cops are perceived by most grand jurors as the sentries on the @entity166 , protecting law - abiding citizens from the forces of violence and disorder			0
the perception of minority groups from aggressively policed neighborhoods outside " the @entity166 " may be entirely different			0
but unlike " @entity163 , " the @entity175 can be removed by democratic vote and the sentries replaced			0
street protests will not accomplish this , but voting will			2
in this country , the path to power proceeds through the ballot box rather than street demonstrations			2
instead of attempting to dispense with the law of the grand jury and to seek unlawful conviction by mob sentiment , the most extreme demonstrators in @entity8 might be wise to remember the words of my favorite lawyer , sir @entity194 , as recreated in the movie " @entity196			1
" more was the chancellor of the exchequer under @entity199 who chose death rather than dishonor			0
in the scene where his daughter 's suitor , @entity203 , suggests that it is proper to do anything , including tearing down all laws , to defeat the " devil , " @entity56 replies : " oh ? and when the last law was down , and the @entity210 turned ' round on you , where would you hide , @entity203 , the laws all being flat ? this country is planted thick with laws , from coast to coast , man 's laws , not @entity218 's ! " and if you cut them down , and you 're just the man to do it , do you really think you could stand upright in the winds that would blow then ? yes , i 'd give the @entity210 benefit of law , for my own safety 's sake ! "			0

@entity138 : @entity8 protests certain if grand jury fails to indict officer @entity3
@entity138 : protesters might want to skip grand jury process , but it 's essential
@entity138 : it 's better that a citizens ' panel handle this *explosive* case than a single judge
he says change comes through voting rather than in street demonstrations
