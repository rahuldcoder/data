check your @entity1 mail lately ? did n't think so			2
apparently not many others did , either			0
so after three - plus years , the world 's largest social media outlet is pulling the plug on its little - used e-mail service , the company confirmed tuesday			1
" we 're making this change because most people have n't been using their @entity1 e-mail address , and we can focus on improving our mobile messaging experience for everyone , " @entity1 said in a statement			2
for those who do have a @entity1 mail account , messages will be forwarded to the primary e-mail address listed in a user 's account , the company said			1
the changes are planned to roll out in march , and users can turn off that forwarding option if they prefer not to have their personal inboxes flooded with these messages			2
" it 's a little bit of bowing to the inevitable , " said @entity28 , editor of the trade site inside @entity1			1
the e-mail addresses , which showed up as messages for @entity1 users , never took off , and when @entity1 tried to make them the default e-mail accounts for all users in mid- 2012 , " a lot of people were unhappy with that , " he said			1
" it was kind of rolled out to everyone regardless of what they wanted , " @entity28 said			0
with last week 's $ 19 billion acquisition of @entity44 , the fast - growing messaging service , @entity1 is focusing more on mobile messaging than e-mail these days			1
@entity1 ventured into the e-mail field in november 2010 , adding the service to the messaging system already used heavily by its 1.2 billion users			1
ceo @entity52 said at the time that the system would complement , not compete , with entrenched e-mail giants such as @entity56 , @entity57 and @entity58			0
" we do n't expect anyone to wake up tomorrow and say , ' i 'm going to shut down my @entity57 account or my @entity64 account and switch exclusively to @entity1			0
' but we do expect a shift to more real - time communication , " he said			0
@entity28 said the reversal is unlikely to be remembered in the company 's annals -- much like the service itself			0
" many people probably were n't even aware of the change , " he said .			0

" it 's a little bit of bowing to the inevitable , " *analyst* says
@entity1 plans to pulls the plug on its e-mail service in march
few of its 1.2 billion users used the service , the social media giant says
messages from those accounts will be forwarded to a user 's primary e-mail
