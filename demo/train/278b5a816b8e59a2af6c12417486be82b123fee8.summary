-- this journey began with such a simple idea : a day of peace			1
we all want a world without war , without conflict , without human suffering			2
a single day is a window of opportunity			1
on september 21 last year , @entity14 2011 , my organization , @entity11 launched the 365 - day countdown toward a global truce -- what we hope will be the largest reduction in global violence in recorded history , both domestically and internationally , and the biggest ever gathering of individuals in the name of peace			1
it would be the global community 's legacy , not mine			2
what we want to tell individuals is that the power to change the world lies in their hands			2
i do n't believe in cynicism , in apathy ; it does n't get you anywhere			0
cynicism kills potential and possibility			0
and if we 're not working towards a better world , what 's the point ? when i was younger , i read a book by @entity44 , this wonderful nuclear physicist			0
he said that media had a responsibility , that all sectors of society had a responsibility to try and move things forward			0
i was concerned about what was going on in the world			0
i could n't understand the starvation , the destruction , the killing of innocent people			2
i 'd been messing around with a camera most of my life ; i thought , well maybe i could do something			0
maybe i could become a filmmaker			0
maybe i can use the form of film constructively			0
@entity66 : in defense of dialogue i thought i could go and film older and wiser people who would tell me how they made sense of what was going on around the world			2
but i realized that a series of sound bites in itself was n't enough , that there needed to be a mountain to climb , there needed to be a journey that i had to take			0
and if i took that journey , it would be completely irrelevant whether it failed or succeeded			0
the point is that there would be a hook : is the destruction of the world inevitable ? is humankind fundamentally evil ? as we become a global community , are we becoming indifferent to one another ? when it comes to the fundamental issues that humanity faces , solutions involve shifting consciousness towards cooperation			0
a single day is an achievable starting point			1
making that starting point a self - sustaining , institutionalized celebration is what we work towards at @entity11			1
@entity66 : poems of war , peace , women and power each year , september 21 marks @entity14 -- a day for wide - scale community action , and a day for @entity108 agencies and aid organizations to safely carry out life - saving work			1
by 2007 , 100 million people were active on @entity14 and since then , @entity14 agreements by all parties to conflict in @entity114 have resulted in the immunization against polio of 4.5 million children in areas hitherto unreachable or hard to reach due to conflict			1
on @entity14 2008 , the @entity108 @entity120 recorded a 70 % reduction in violent incidents in @entity114			1
for @entity14 2012 , we are inviting all sectors of society to observe a day of @entity126 -- individuals in every country , at home , in schools , in the workplace , in our local communities , and those engaged in armed conflict on the international stage			1
everyone has a role to play			0
the @entity11 campaign will only work if the people get behind it -- if you get behind it			1
please join the campaign via www.peaceoneday.org and ask as many people as you can to do the same , via social media or via the new free @entity147 individuals can make a difference			1
by working together there will be @entity11			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity153 .			2

@entity153 had a simple idea : a single day of peace every september 21
his organization , @entity11 , calls for a day of cease - fire internationally
in past @entity14 has allowed , for example , immunizations in @entity114 , he says
@entity153 : @entity11 campaign will only work if people everywhere get behind it
