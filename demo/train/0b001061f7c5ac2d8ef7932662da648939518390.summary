at the time , he suspected @entity3 security agents had kidnapped the defecting officer			2
" i talked to him on the morning of august 29th , " @entity28 said			0
" he said ' i have a meeting with a @entity5 security man			2
when i finish i will call you			0
' i waited for three days and did n't hear from him			0
then after that we discovered that the security man took him and did n't send him back to the camp			0
they sent him to @entity3 directly			2
the @entity5 made a trick with @entity11			1
they caught him in @entity5 and sent him to @entity3			1

@entity1 has previously asked the @entity79 about @entity11 , but @entity5 diplomats said they were not familiar with his case			1
@entity5 @entity83 officials were accompanying @entity5 prime minister @entity84 on a tour of @entity86 , @entity87 and @entity88			2
one official who requested anonymity told @entity1 the government " on principle " never hands over people who came to @entity5 on humanitarian grounds			2
there are more than 7,600 @entity3 refugees in six @entity5 refugee camps and there is daily traffic back and forth across the borders			1
in @entity86 , the first stop on the @entity5 delegation 's trip , @entity3 activists tried to confront @entity105 about @entity11			1
when @entity84 emerged from the headquarters of the @entity109 in @entity110 on tuesday , a crowd of angry @entity3 activists stood outside the gates chanting " @entity84 coward " and " @entity84 , where is @entity11 ? " @entity84 waved to the crowd , apparently not understanding the question			1
but one @entity3 activist cornered a senior @entity5 official next to the government motorcade and demanded to know @entity11 's whereabouts			1
the @entity5 official had no idea what he was talking about			0
@entity5 is critical to the @entity3 opposition movement			1
dissidents have fled to @entity5 to escape the ongoing government crackdown in @entity3 and have been holding opposition meetings in @entity5 cities			1
on thursday , a @entity3 opposition council is announcing its creation in @entity0 , the latest in a number of groups claiming to represent the opposition in @entity3 and abroad			0
but now , with @entity3 announcing it has @entity11 in custody , opposition activists said they feel betrayed by the @entity5 government			1
" i ca n't trust the @entity5 any more			0
they are hypocrites , " said @entity28			0
" there are a lot of questions that the @entity3 government and the @entity5 government should answer , " said @entity75 , who is based in @entity136 , @entity137			1
the importance of @entity11 to the @entity3 regime became evident september 8 , when opposition activists and residents inside @entity3 called @entity1 to report @entity3 security forces had attacked the village of @entity148 , where @entity11 's brother @entity149 lived			1
according to the @entity151 - based @entity150 , a number of @entity3 army defectors had taken shelter in @entity148 while awaiting the chance to smuggle themselves across the nearby border to @entity5			1
