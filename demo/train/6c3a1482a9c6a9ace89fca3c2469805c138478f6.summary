the @entity11 played 85 minutes of @entity3 's 2 - 0 victory over @entity13 before being substituted to a standing ovation following a promising debut			1
" it was a very special day for me			0
my first game -- my debut -- with a victory			0
i enjoyed it a lot , " @entity1 told @entity3 's in - house media company mutv			1
" what i love most is to play			0
so these minutes [ on the pitch ] are very important			0
now i 'm going to train and i 'm looking forward to playing at the weekend and trying to do my best for the team			0
" signed for a club record $ 61 million , @entity1 -- who trained with his new team - mates for the first time on monday following his move from @entity35 -- had a hand in @entity3 's opening goal			1
it came as he swept a diagonal ball out to @entity40 , whose cross was eventually turned in by @entity42 after @entity44 's header hit the crossbar			0
the @entity46 had needed just six minutes to score after making his first start since december 10 following a thigh problem			0
@entity40 doubled the lead in the second half as @entity3 ensured that the return of 1999 @entity52 winning legend @entity51 , now in charge of @entity13 , to @entity6 was not a happy one			2
@entity3 's victory enabled them to close the gap on sixth - placed @entity59 , who were thumped 4 - 0 by city rivals @entity61 as @entity62 ( 2 ) , @entity63 and @entity64 gave the home fans a night to remember			1
the misery for @entity68 boss @entity67 was compounded when @entity69 was forced off the field on a stretcher after a worrying injury to his ankle			0
dropped points another manager who may be feeling a little unease is @entity77 , whose @entity9 side lost two potentially crucial points at @entity80 in a 2 - 2 draw			1
the @entity83 ' coach was held up in traffic ahead of the game and the team also struggled to go through the gears , trailing 1 - 0 at halftime following a lackluster 45 minutes			2
goals from @entity90 and @entity91 turned the game on its head , but @entity93 replied for the hosts to ensure that the match finished 2 - 2			2
@entity9 still lead the @entity8 but the draw means second - placed @entity97 can climb above them should @entity100 's free - scoring side win at @entity101 on wednesday			1
@entity35 can also climb above @entity9 on wednesday , should @entity103 's side beat @entity104 at home by more than two goals			2
in tuesday 's other games , @entity107 and @entity108 recorded much - needed wins -- at home to @entity112 ( 2 - 0 ) and @entity113 ( 1 - 0 ) respectively -- while @entity114 hosted @entity115 in a goalless encounter that featured a red card apiece for both sides .			1
