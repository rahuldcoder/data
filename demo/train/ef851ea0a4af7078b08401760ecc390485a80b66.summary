@entity1 , @entity0 -- what does yours sound like ? new tunes : one of the inventors behind popular game ' @entity7 ' , @entity8 , is now working with robots			1
it 's a question that could one day be as common as asking what your @entity12 profile picture is -- at least if @entity8 has anything to do with it			1
the self - described composer / inventor / educator from the @entity17 's ( @entity17 ) @entity18 is working at the leading edge of interactive music -- designing a range of new concepts , including personal operas			1
personal operas could one day allow humans to record the details of our lives -- our feelings , relationships , and beliefs -- in our own personalized opera show			1
@entity8 told @entity2 the personal opera is something he would like to see available for everyone in future			1
" it 's about what you can pass on for others			2
if you could make that system available for everybody you can leave your stories , your images behind			2
@entity46 has always attracted me as you can tell a whole story with it , " he said			0
with this concept , instruments can adapt to the way people behave or express themselves , so a person 's personality can be shown through the music and performance of an opera - which would also allow images and other memories to form part of the show			1
the technology would allow users to leave behind their legacy , he said			1
@entity8 's @entity18 has developed software which drives the project , called " @entity67			1
" @entity67 allows the user to make real music using just lines and colors			2
the user draws in the lines and colors and the notes are automatically made from that , he said			0
in a new leap incorporating these ideas , @entity8 has been working on an operatic performance called " @entity79 and the @entity80 " which details the life of @entity82 -- a man he describes as " a mixture of @entity85 , @entity86 and @entity87			1
" the show debuts at @entity89 in september 2009 , and @entity8 said it should revolutionize the world of opera -- by introducing the personal opera combined with robotic instruments and ' hyperinstruments '			1
it also includes the world 's first robotic stage			2
" he [ @entity82 ] wants to leave his memories and relationships behind but he himself wants to be gone			2
once he does go , the main character after that is the stage itself , " @entity8 said			1
but how does this work ? @entity8 said there are several aspects , including 16 robotic boxes that can move around on stage by themselves			1
" they play the role of a @entity115 chorus			0
they will be themselves and they come alive			0
some of them come in and out			0
it 's a visual and musical language which is n't anthropomorphic			1
" " the chandelier is also a robotic instrument			0
it has strings and these are played by little mechanical fingers that pluck the strings			0
you can send acoustic signals to it as well , " @entity8 said			2
amazing as it is , this is only one strand of @entity8 's remarkable work			1
" @entity136 " are about making instruments that respond in new ways to those playing them			0
@entity8 has also been able to alter how each instrument can be controlled			2
" i started imagining sounds that i just could n't make from traditional instruments , " he said			0
" with a computer we can build any instrument you can imagine			0
for example with a ' hypercello ' we can make it so that if you flick your wrist the whole tonality changes about it			0
" and the relationship between what instructions you give the instrument and what result you get at the other end does n't have to be the same			0
you can make the instrument very much like an existing instrument or you can make it very different			0
if you are making a hyperinstrument for a five - year - old then you want to make it very easy to tap and play , " he said			0
@entity8 is undoubtedly passionate about making the musical experience accessible to everyone , and it was work from his @entity18 which brought about the blockbuster video game " @entity7			1
" he believes that type of interfacing can soon be developed further			0
" what would happen if you had such experiences where you could actually learn how to play the guitar ? i think that 's something we are going to see fairly soon , " @entity8 said			1
@entity8 is also interested in a new type of collaboration between the people making music and the people listening which he says appears to be already beginning			1
he cites the example of the band @entity180 , which offered for sale all of the individual tracks for one of its songs to encourage listeners to create their own version			0
" it would be excellent if somebody got interested in this side of music and then got some feedback , or if @entity180 now and then got ideas back that blew them away			2
i think that kind of thing is possible			0
" just when you think @entity8 has exhausted every musical concept you could think of , he admits he 's plotting another			1
given that he lives on a farm , it 's no surprise @entity8 would like to use some of his concepts to explore the musical abilities of animals			1
" we have believed for a long time that humans are the only musicians			0
it 's beginning to look more and more likely that this is n't true			2
we have only scratched the surface as to what musical creatures are around , " @entity8 told @entity2			1
he firmly believes that animals will have a lot to offer the musical world			2
" before i die i would like to do an animal piece			0
it will be a way of seeing what animals are really doing			0
" @entity216 also contributed to this report			0

@entity8 's team at the @entity18 were behind popular game " @entity7 "
