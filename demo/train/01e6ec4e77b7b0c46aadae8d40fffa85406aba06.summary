@entity1 columnist @entity0 recently traveled to @entity2 to try to find out why that state has the highest rate of reported rape in the nation -- three times the national average -- and what could be done to change that			1
he 's asking readers to be part of the solution			2
you voted for him to cover this topic as part of @entity1 's @entity17 project			1
the truth is even one rape is too many -- in @entity2 or anywhere			1
women and men who are victims of rape or sexual assault need support from their communities and from you			1
here are some @entity1 - vetted organizations working to reduce the rate of violence against women in @entity32 's 49th state : @entity33 the @entity33 , or @entity33 , is the organization that runs the @entity34 ( 4673 )			1
a caller can be connected a local organization within their communities that can help them find the nearest hospital capable of collecting forensic evidence of a rape			2
they can also provide an advocate to go to the hospital with a rape victim			0
@entity33 can also assist with counseling and legal guidance			0
the organization has affiliates all over the country , including several in @entity2			1
standing together against rape one of @entity33 's @entity2 affiliates is called @entity50 , or standing together against @entity51			1
@entity50 is based in @entity52 and has several of its own hotlines as well			0
the local crisis number is 907 - 276 - 7273 , and statewide , it 's 800 - 478 - 8999			0
@entity50 has served survivors of sexual assault in @entity2 for more than 30 years , providing a confidential and safe place to talk through their experience as well as a connection to medical and social services			1
@entity50 also works with @entity61 in @entity62 or @entity63 to provide a 24 - hour shelter where victims of domestic abuse or sexual assault may live for up to a month			1
@entity68 on @entity69 and @entity70 another group helping sexual assault survivors in @entity2 is @entity73 , or the @entity68 on @entity69 and sexual assault			2
this network of programs has served @entity2 since 1980 , providing survivors with emergency shelter , 24 - hour crisis hotlines , food , clothing , confidential advocacy , counseling , support groups and community outreach as well as rural outreach			1
this group has a presence in much of the state , including more rural and remote areas			0
the @entity91 the @entity68 on @entity69 and @entity70 's community outreach is extensive			0
it even has a special program for schools called @entity95 , which is designed to develop skills of students in grades seven through nine on how to handle bullying , personal relationships , peer and dating violence , substance use and other high - risk behaviors			0
more than 50 schools in @entity2 participate in the @entity91 program			2
aiding women in @entity108 and rape emergencies finally , there 's @entity112 - based @entity111 , or @entity113			0
the group has two crisis hotlines -- one for @entity112 ( 907 - 586 - 1090 ) and one for the rest of @entity2 ( 800 - 478 - 1090 )			2
@entity111 provides an advocate to listen to survivor 's stories and discuss legal options			0
it also operates a shelter in @entity112 , one of the first in the state			0
while the advocates are not attorneys , they can provide the proper paperwork and support to get a protective order			0
rape and sexual assault are problems anywhere they occur , and there are many programs nationwide worthy of support			0
but as @entity0 found in his study , the rate is alarmingly high in @entity2			1
even if you live far away from @entity32 's " @entity2 , " you can help make the state safer by supporting these organizations .			2
