top officials at the campaign committee for @entity2 said tuesday they were n't aware of anonymous @entity4 accounts that were used ahead of the midterms to share internal polling data with outside groups , potentially violating campaign finance laws			1
" i do n't know anything about it , " @entity10 rep. @entity9 , the chairman of the @entity11 , told @entity12 tuesday			1
@entity12 reported monday that @entity11 and at least two outside groups -- @entity16 and @entity17 -- masked their identities through anonymous @entity4 accounts to share information about @entity2 races			1
campaign finance experts said that pushed the limits of election laws that bar coordination between campaigns and outside groups , such as super pacs and nonprofits			1
@entity9 said he had heard about his group 's involvement only after the @entity12 report so he could n't comment in detail			2
when asked if he planned to investigate the behavior within the @entity11 , @entity9 said he would " look into it " internally			0
he suggested , however , that it was n't a priority			0
" we 've got a few other things going on officially around here that i 've got to deal with , " he said			0
according to a source with knowledge of the activity , the groups posted internal polling data in shorthand on @entity4 , a public forum , to avoid the appearance of coordination			2
the accounts , however , were not publicly affiliated with any of the groups who viewed or posted to them			0
while @entity9 denied knowledge of his group 's activities , he defended the practice briefly when pressed about whether he thought using the accounts was appropriate			0

" it 's the first i 've ever heard of it , " he told @entity12			0
