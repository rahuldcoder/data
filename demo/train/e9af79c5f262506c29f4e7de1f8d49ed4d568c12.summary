-- one of the @entity2 's most critically endangered butterflies is making a comeback thanks to a profit making partnership between private landowners and conservation organizations			1
the heath fritillary -- a rare species exclusive to the south of @entity10 that thrives in cleared woodland environments -- has declined sharply over the past 25 years as forest clearing has become less common			1
but population numbers are on the rise again after the introduction of a forestry management scheme that enables rural landowners to cash in by creating butterfly habitats on their property			1
" we were down to 12 colonies ( of heath fritillary ) in 1995 and most of those were very small , " says dr. @entity20 , chief executive of @entity21 , the organization behind the projects implementation			1
" since then we 've been able to work with landowners to get the management back up again and we are now looking at 25 colonies in the same area			2
" see also : butterfly farmers help protect threatened forests the conservation scheme works by first sourcing locations where there are remnants of heath fritillary colonies			1
those who own the land identified during this process -- be they individuals , businesses or wildlife trusts -- are then approached for permission to carry out the conservation work			2
this primarily consists of clearing the areas pinpointed of their indigenous plant life and repopulating them with the lighter foliage the heath fritillary requires to prosper			1
if landowners agree to take part in the project , they are then able to sell on the discarded lumber that accumulates during the clearing and ensuing maintenance process at a profit			2
see also : @entity59 tries to balance farming and forests " a lot of this is about persuasion , " says @entity20			0
" you have to deal with loads of different people who all have their own agenda and financial constraints			0
" " when you go in there and say ' there is a rare butterfly on your land ' you can sometimes get a very bad response , " he adds			0
although @entity20 admits the profit margins remain relatively small at this stage and that the scheme itself relies on grants from the @entity80 to break even , he sees potential for much larger projects in the future			2
he says that there are currently numerous sites throughout the @entity2 -- where nearly three quarters of butterfly species have seen their numbers decline in the last 10 years -- being scouted for their suitability by @entity21			1
there are also scores of endangered butterfly species across @entity91 that could benefit from the implementation of similar cleared woodland schemes , he adds			0
see also : can wooden skyscrapers transform concrete jungle ? " there are a whole suite of them ( countries ) where woodlands are not being managed to the detriment of butterflies , " says @entity20			0
yet despite his enthusiasm for the project , @entity20 cautions that there must be a balance struck between maintaining natural forest environments and manipulating their makeup through woodland clearing			0
" we would n't advocate every woodland area be managed as there are many other species that depend on mature woodland to thrive , " he says			0
if an equilibrium between profit , species conservation and respecting natural forest ecosystems can be achieved however , all kinds of diverse forest wildlife could benefit , he adds .			0

one of @entity2 's most critically endangered butterflies is making a comeback
the heath fritillary conservation scheme partners conservationists with private landowners
the project generates cash and could be *replicated* to save other endangered butterflies , say @entity21
