-- each day , they live in fear			1
sometimes it 's the fear of rockets dropping from the sky			1
sometimes it 's violent fundamentalists taking over their cities			1
sometimes it 's the barrel bombs stuffed with @entity11 and nails			1
exactly what horror they face depends on which border they live within			1
@entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21			1
each with its unique crisis , but all now unified in a heightened sense of anxiety as years of conflict come to a head			1
" i would argue , " @entity30 sen. @entity29 said this week , " that given conditions in the @entity33 , this might be more dangerous than any time in the past			1
" here 's where the crises stand : @entity17 @entity37 wins ... again with carnage mounting every day across the country , it 's hard to find reason to celebrate in @entity17			1
and yet president @entity42 and his supporters find a way			1
on wednesday , @entity42 was sworn in for his third term			1
it 's an outcome pretty much everyone expected -- not because he is popularly adored , but because his family has ruled @entity17 since 1971			1
and no real contender ran against him			1
three years of civil war have left much of the country in shambles			1
while regime helicopters drop barrel bombs on opposition neighborhoods , dissidents say , the government maintains its stance that it 's only fighting terrorists			1
as if the civil war was n't enough , the radical @entity61 group @entity62 in @entity18 in @entity17 is using this opportunity to carve its own swath of territory from the @entity18 border to deep inside @entity17			1
the @entity68 says more than 150,000 people have been killed in the past three years			1
but at this point , many have stopped counting			1
" no one is winning ; no one can win , " @entity68 @entity73 ban ki - moon said			2
" even if one side were to prevail in the short term , the devastating toll will have sown the seeds of future conflict			1
" why we should care : for @entity30 thinking the @entity17 crisis does n't hit home , think again			1
@entity30 intelligence and law enforcement have dozens of investigations under way , tracking @entity30 who traveled to @entity17 to join the fight			1
" the @entity89 and other members of the intelligence community have made this a top priority and are taking whatever steps they can under the law to monitor and prevent those coming back from doing us harm , " assistant attorney general @entity88 said			2
@entity18 threat of fundamentalism looms this month was supposed mark @entity18 's first steps toward a new government			2
but it 's hard to tout political gains when @entity107 militants keep barreling across the country , snatching entire cities and threatening to take over @entity110			2
@entity107 now controls land on both sides of the @entity18 - @entity17 border -- opening the floodgates for weapons and fighters between the two countries			1
on wednesday , @entity18 security forces had to withdraw from central @entity119 after fierce fighting with militants believed to be @entity107 members			1
at least 52 @entity18 security forces were killed			2
now , an unlikely pair of countries are coming to assist the embattled government -- the @entity30 and @entity127			2
while @entity30 advisers are on the ground assisting security forces , @entity18 is increasingly relying on @entity127 - backed @entity132 militias to stave off radical @entity61 @entity107 militants -- especially around the capital			2
why we should care : former @entity30 vice president @entity136 said the crisis in @entity18 now involves throngs of foreigners -- possibly including @entity30			1
" one of the problems you 've got now is a caliphate that includes part of @entity17 , part of @entity18 , and you 've got literally thousands of jihadist wannabes flooding into that part of the world from @entity150 -- some of them probably from the @entity30 -- who want to participate in that conflict , " @entity136 told @entity0 's @entity140			1
" it 's a threat to us , to the @entity30 , not just to that part of the world			2
" @entity21 a free - for - all nearly three years after @entity21 rebels overthrew a longtime dictator , the country is no closer to lasting stability			2
the civil war that culminated in @entity161 's 2011 death has given way to warring militias fighting over @entity165 's international airport			2
at least 90 % of the planes there have been damaged , and it would cost hundreds of millions of dollars to repair them , the government said			2
so are fuel tanks and trucks			2
even the control tower has been hit			2
the chaos in the capital is so dire now that officials are considering asking for international troops -- even though the government is virtually powerless and has very little influence on what 's happening on the ground			2
not only is government is weak , but militias actually outnumber and outgun its security forces			0
why we should care : the @entity186 said the fighting could lead to widespread conflict			0
" we affirm our support for @entity21 's democratic transition and urge the seating of the new @entity192 as soon as possible , " the @entity186 said			0
" we stress the vital role @entity21 's @entity194 plays in building the new country for which @entity21 sacrificed so much during the revolution			0
" and of course the @entity30 is still trying to figure out more details on the 2012 attack that killed four @entity30 at a @entity30 diplomatic compound in @entity200 , including @entity30 ambassador @entity201			0
@entity19 and @entity20 retaliation and recrimination what was supposed to be a cease - fire between @entity20 forces and @entity207 militant group @entity206 this week now seems like a joke			0
@entity209 fired by @entity206 on tuesday were quickly matched by airstrikes from @entity20			0
and so the exchanges continue			0
now , a leading member of @entity206 says he 's not opposed to peace -- but says there needs to be more compromise			0
" we hope we can achieve a cease - fire -- but a cease - fire which can protect the @entity207 and guarantee that there will be no violations , " @entity206 spokesman @entity216 said			0
@entity20 , which accepted a cease - fire proposal by @entity223 , defended its decision to strike back against @entity206			0
" instead of having this door open to a diplomatic solution , they closed the door , " said @entity225 , spokesman for the @entity20 prime minister			0
" we now have to , unfortunately , protect our people through military means			0
" while both rockets and rhetoric fly , @entity233 said @entity20 air attacks have been " killing civilians in violation of the laws of war			0
" an @entity20 military spokesman said civilian casualties in @entity19 are " a human tragedy " -- but that it 's @entity206 ' fault			0
the military accuses @entity206 of taking civilians hostage by using places like houses , hospitals and schools to hide weapons			0
more than 200 people have been killed in @entity19 since the offensive started a week ago , @entity207 officials said			0
one @entity20 has also died			0
why we should care : many credit @entity20 's @entity257 for saving untold lives on the @entity20 side			0
in 2014 , the @entity30 provided $ 235 million for @entity257 research , development and production , according to the @entity263			0
@entity20 is also the biggest recipient of @entity30 foreign aid , much of which has gone toward @entity20 's military spending			0
@entity30 secretary of state @entity268 say 's he 'll return to the region if a cease - fire does n't materialize			0
" i am prepared to fly back to the region tomorrow , if i have to , or the next day , or the next , in order to pursue the prospects if this does n't work , " @entity268 said			0
" but they deserve , the @entity223 deserve the time and the space to be able to try to make this initiative work			1
" chief @entity207 negotiator @entity279 put it bluntly : " we need the @entity30			0
" " now the region is really boiling , " he said			0
" failure is not an option here			0
" @entity0 's @entity286 , @entity287 , @entity288 , @entity289 , @entity290 and @entity291 contributed to this report .			0

a series of *unrelated* crises are blending into a regional *nightmare*
