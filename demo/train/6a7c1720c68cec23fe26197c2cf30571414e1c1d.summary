-- savvy internet users know that all the great stuff they get from the internet us for " free " — the searches , the social networks , the games , even the news — is n't really free			0
it 's an exchange , where companies are able to take user data , sell it to advertisers , and make money that allows them to give themselves a paycheck while keeping you afloat in free digital services			1
so that data you 're giving away online is worth something , but have you ever taken a stab at figuring out how much ? a just - released privacy add - on for @entity25 and @entity26 , @entity27 , gives it the old college try			1
both @entity30 and the executive branch have been talking more about online privacy in the past couple years			0
the estimates for @entity34 and @entity35 are imprecise , as the program 's creator , @entity37 founder @entity36 , readily admits			1
" we wanted people to understand , it is a value exchange " when they use these sites , said @entity36			0
@entity27 measures your last 60 days of activity on @entity34 , extrapolates that to a year , and uses a value - per - search estimate			2
analysts believed @entity34 was making $ 14.70 per 1,000 searches in 2010 , and possibly less in 2011			2
of course , if you spend all your time searching for luxury hotels or mesothelioma lawyers — and then clicking through the advertised links — you 're much more valuable than the average user			0
@entity36 says his estimated annual @entity35 value was a mere $ 1.68			1
his daughter , perhaps unsurprisingly , is at $ 12			0
his @entity34 value checks in at more than $ 700 per year , though			1
the add - on also tells you how many of the websites you visit feed data back to @entity35 and @entity34			1
i was surprised to see that @entity35 is tracking me across 87 percent of the @entity62 , despite the fact that i 'm a minimal user of @entity35			2
@entity27 has a checklist for @entity35 privacy settings , with orange warning signs near settings that users might want to take a look at			2
unless you 're a complete privacy hawk already — or you do n't care at all — you 'll probably find something new on that list that you were n't aware of			0
did you know @entity35 automatically shares your profile info when you visit certain sites ? did you know your profile details are sometimes shared not just with your friends , but often with the makers of your friends ' apps ? @entity27 also gives you a heads - up on things you should be doing anyhow , like deleting @entity35 apps you no longer use so that they stop gathering data			1
the add - on links you directly to those @entity35 settings so you can fix them immediately , navigating you through a maze of privacy options some find arcane ; it has a similar function for @entity34			1
" i have n't had anyone go through this process who was not surprised by something [ they saw ] , " said @entity36			0
while it is n't @entity36 's intention that all users should tightly clamp down their privacy controls , that 's what most of the users of @entity27 have chosen to do so far , he said			0
future plans include similar privacy controls for @entity105 and @entity106 , as well as a mobile app. copyright 2011 @entity108			0

new add - on attempts to measure the value of your data to websites
@entity35 , @entity34 and other sites make their money using data for advertising
@entity27 works with @entity25 and @entity26 web *browsers*
creator says his yearly value is $ 1.68 to @entity35 , but $ 700 to @entity34
