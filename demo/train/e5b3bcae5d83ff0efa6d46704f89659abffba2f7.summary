-- nearly one - fifth of @entity2 4 - year - olds are obese , and children of color are at higher risk , according to new research			1
obese children are at risk for early onset of diabetes , fatty liver and musculoskeletal problems			1
researchers calculated the body mass index from a sample of 8,550 @entity18 , black , white , @entity17 and native american 4 - year - olds			1
the children were born in 2001 , and in 2005 , their height and weight were measured -- 18.4 percent of them were obese			1
" significant differences in the prevalence of obesity between racial / ethnic groups were evident at 4 years of age , " the researchers wrote in the april issue of the @entity24			1
using body mass index , they found that 31.2 percent of @entity34 / @entity33 , 22 percent of @entity35 , 20.8 percent of blacks , 15.9 percent of whites and 12.8 percent of @entity32 were obese			1
" it 's surprising that there are large differences by racial / ethnic group by that age , " said @entity37 , an assistant professor of epidemiology at the @entity39 and lead study author			2
@entity46 and co-author @entity47 's analysis showed that children were becoming obese even before encountering soda and candy vending machines in schools			1
" these results really do point to the need for us to focus attention on early childhood and the need for research to understand how these differences can emerge so early , " @entity46 said			1
" to do that , we may need to understand the different family and cultural factors that are at play in these children 's lives			1
" the cause for the early health disparities is hard to pinpoint , childhood obesity experts said			1
" it 's always possible there are biological factors within ethnic groups , " said dr. @entity69 , director of the @entity70 at the @entity71			1
" we know most of the changes that have occurred in body fat tend to occur from being in an environment that promotes very easy access to high - caloric foods and limited opportunities for physical activities			1
" @entity83 , an associate professor of pediatrics at @entity85 , called the disparities between ethnic groups disturbing			2
" the expectations , lifestyle , behaviors are different on a cultural and socioeconomic basis , " he said			1
" kids who live in the inner city , whose neighborhoods are perceived as dangerous , stay at home more , sit more , eat more snacks , because that 's all they can get at the local bodega			0
there are no supermarkets to get produce			0
that 's what mom is eating , so that 's what kid is eating			0
what we 're dealing with here is whole life issues			0
" previous research has shown that older children are becoming less active and spending more time in front of a computer or tv			1
" that is displacing physical activity , " said dr. @entity116 , director of the @entity117 at @entity118 in @entity119			0
" you can imagine strollers , less outdoor play -- all those kinds of things that have shifted how much activity younger kids are getting			2
at the same time , portion sizes are increasing for everybody			0
" according to data from the @entity133 , adults fare no better			0
approximately 45 percent of blacks , 36.8 percent of @entity134 and 30 percent of whites are obese			1
" it 's a very bad sign if we see obesity at a young age , " @entity69 said			2
" when we see children obese at age 4 , we 're likely to see complications -- high blood pressure , abnormal lipids -- which can lead to heart disease and stroke , diabetes in children			1
" diseases commonly seen in 40 - or 50 - year - olds are presenting in 6 - and 7 - year - olds			1
obese children are developing type 2 diabetes , fatty liver disease and musculoskeletal problems , which occur because their bodies ca n't carry that much weight , doctors said			2
calculate your child 's body mass index			0
" the heavier you are as a child , the likelier that extra weight will follow you through life , " @entity69 said			0
" that 's why we see adolescents who need weight - loss surgery , because they have life - threatening complications from obesity			1
" if you have an obese child ... the first step is for the parents to acknowledge that the child is overweight , instead of making excuses or comparing him or her to heavier children			2
many of the parents of obese children are overweight themselves , which makes that acknowledgment difficult , said @entity83 , who is also director of the @entity182 at @entity118 in @entity183			2
" while it 's important to focus on it and take it seriously , it 's also important not to give up or feel hopeless , " he said			0
" then you wo n't try			0
you want to look at it for what it is and not be defeated by it			0
" when you 're trying to help your child achieve a healthy weight , remove the stigma attached to obesity			2
" it should always be about health , not about losing weight , " @entity83 said			0
" you 're trying to build the positive			0
" he recommended the 5 - 2 - 1 - 0 plan			2
eat at least five servings of fruits and vegetables , cut screen time down to two hours or less , exercise at least one hour , and have zero soda and sugary drinks			0
such changes , which are not seismic shifts to lifestyles , can help the child get into a health weight			0
" it 's easier to start that way , rather than try to change habits when they 're 8 or 12 or 16 , " said @entity116 , an associate professor of pediatrics at the @entity214 in @entity119 , @entity215			0
while it 's possible for some kids to outgrow the excess weight , she warned parents not to count on that			0
" we 've seen over time that the environment does n't promote that , " she said .			0
