@entity0 -- wrapped in heavy coats against the november chill , thousands of visitors crowd onto the paths circling the @entity6 to catch a glimpse of the extraordinary " sea " of crimson filling the castle 's moat below			1
the blood - red tide which flows from one of the palace 's windows and laps at its ancient stone walls is made of hundreds of thousands of individually handcrafted ceramic poppies			2
each of the 888,246 blooms in the artwork , " @entity28 and @entity29 , " represents a life lost in @entity22 -- one for each of the @entity25 and @entity26 soldiers killed in the conflict that began 100 years ago			1
and as @entity25 commemorates @entity30 in the war 's centenary year , the final poppy will be " planted " shortly before 11am on november 11 , the time at which the armistice was signed , ending the war in 1918			1
once the evolving artwork , which began with the planting of the first poppy by @entity6 @entity40 on july 17 , is " complete " a lone bugler will play the @entity41 , signaling the start of two minutes ' silence in memory of the war dead			2
less than 24 hours later , the army of thousands of volunteers who helped put it together will sweep in and begin dismantling it , " picking " each flower			0
the poppies will then be checked , cleaned and packed before being shipped to their new owners -- each has been sold , for Â £ 25 ( about $ 40 ) , to benefit six armed forces charities			0
but following widespread calls for the hugely popular installation to remain in place longer , even until 2018 , leaving them at the @entity6 for the duration of the @entity22 anniversary , organizers said two parts of the display would be kept in place until the end of november			1
the " weeping window " and the " wave " of poppies across the path leading into the @entity6 will then be taken on a tour of the @entity25 , before becoming part of the permanent exhibitions at the @entity70 in @entity0 and @entity71			1
@entity76 ( @entity76 ) , the organization which runs the @entity6 , tweeted : " we 're pleased to confirm that these two major features of the # @entity78 will be going on national tour until 2018			2
" @entity76 says in excess of 4 million people -- between 60,000 and 70,000 a day -- are expected to have visited the installation by the time it ends			1
in a statement , @entity25 prime minister @entity85 said : " the poppy display at the @entity6 has in a very short space of time become a much loved and respected monument			1
" we want to ensure that as many people as possible have the opportunity to witness it ... by displaying parts of the installation around the country and then permanently in the @entity70 , we have ensured that this poignant memorial will be saved for the nation			2
" the @entity76 spokeswoman told @entity1 that the display 's creators , ceramic artist @entity101 and theater designer @entity102 , had always intended it to be an evolving memorial			0
" that was very much part of the artists ' intentions , the transient nature of it , as is the idea that it will then be dispersed , that the poppies will find new homes , " she said			0
@entity76 and @entity113 have warned those heading to the @entity6 to see the poppies in their last days and weeks that there are likely to be large crowds in the area , and that public transport and tube stations nearby will be far busier than usual			0
in order to allow more people to experience it , the artwork has been illuminated until midnight each evening			0
there are reports that some of those who have bought the blooms are trying to cash in on the enormous popularity of the installation by selling their flowers on internet auction site @entity134 for more than double their original price			0
an @entity134 spokesman told @entity25 's @entity138 newspaper that such inappropriate listings would be canceled			0
@entity85 praised all of those involved in the " extraordinary project , " which he said had " brought forward from the @entity25 public a huge amount of reverence for those who have given their lives and served our country			0
" " the numbers going to see this display have been truly extraordinary , " he said at the weekly prime minister 's questions session in parliament , adding that money raised from the sale of the poppies was likely to fund valuable work by veterans ' charities			0
poppies have been used as a way of commemorating @entity22 for decades -- in @entity25 , thousands of paper flowers are sold for charity each year to be worn in people 's lapels			1
the flowers grew over the battlefields of northern @entity170 and @entity171 , inspiring one of the most famous poems written about the conflict , by @entity175 : " in @entity176 fields the poppies blow , between the crosses , row on row ...
