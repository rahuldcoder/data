-- today is the 46th anniversary of loving v. @entity7 , the landmark @entity2 decision that declared unconstitutional any ban on interracial marriage			1
more than four decades after the historic and aptly named @entity10 decision , the @entity8 @entity2 is once again poised to rule in a case that could put an end to discriminatory bans prohibiting marriage , this time for gay and lesbian couples			1
this month , the @entity8 @entity2 is expected to rule in a decision in @entity18 , a case brought by two @entity21 couples challenging the constitutionality of the state 's ban on same sex marriages , commonly called @entity26			1
attorneys @entity31 and @entity32 -- a @entity27 and @entity28 best known for battling each other before the @entity2 in @entity30 -- have teamed up and taken the @entity34 case beyond @entity21			0
@entity35 and @entity32 argued before the justices that the @entity2 has the obligation under the @entity38 to strike down not just @entity26 8 , but all state laws banning marriage equality for gay and lesbian @entity8			1
after all , they say , this is precisely how the court ruled in @entity10 -- and 13 other cases dating back to 1888 in which a majority of the justices stood up to protect the fundamental right of every @entity8 to marry the person he or she loves			0
a broad ruling in the @entity34 case this month would be a historic step forward in affirming that gay @entity8 are entitled to the same rights and freedoms as everyone else			0
although i firmly believe public opinion is irrelevant to the court 's responsibility to ensure equality under the law , our nation is clearly ready to embrace marriage equality			0
when the @entity2 struck down interracial marriage bans in 1967 , a @entity68 poll found that only 20 % of @entity8 approved of such marriages			1
but the court fulfilled its duty to protect individual rights without regard to what was popular			0
today , we have already have evolved much further on marriage equality			0
a growing bipartisan majority of voters -- 58 % -- support marriage rights for same - sex couples			2
when @entity10 told his lawyer to " tell the court i love my wife , " he could not have known that his words would still be applicable 46 years later in the very same courtroom			1
there is never a wrong time to stand up for justice and equality , but the time has never been more right to stand up for gay rights than in the @entity34 case			2
as the @entity2 weighs equality for gay and lesbian couples , the anniversary of @entity10 provides a timely reminder of a new legacy they could write for the history books			2
