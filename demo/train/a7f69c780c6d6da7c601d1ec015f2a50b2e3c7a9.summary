from futuristic @entity2 headsets to smart watches like @entity5 's @entity4 , wearable gadgets are billed as the next big thing in technology			1
but @entity9 's tech counterfeiters -- notorious for having a nose for what 's hot and what 's not -- appear for now at least to be giving wearable technology the cold shoulder in what one expert calls a " serious warning signal " for market players			1
@entity20 reporters approached wholesale companies and retailers at one of @entity9 's biggest electronics trading districts to learn how the " knock - off " business works			1
" there are no copies for sale			0
only originals , " said the managing director of wholesale company that specializes in mobile electronic devices in @entity33 , a factory town in @entity9 's southern @entity35 region			1
" maybe we 'll have them ( fakes ) in a few months			0
i do n't know , interest is low			0
" @entity9 's thriving market for counterfeit electronic goods has been a headache for global hi - tech firms including @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity5 , as illegal cut - price copies of much sought after products eat into their profits			1
but , one might argue , if there is one thing worse than being copied , that is to be ignored			2
and that seems to be the case with @entity5 's new @entity4 smart watch -- one of the first wearable devices to be made commercially available and as such an indicator for the emerging category			1
a visit to the shops of @entity33 's @entity62 commercial district -- a tightly packed group of malls surrounded by high rises that form the epicenter of @entity9 's trade in electronic knock - offs -- suggests demand for @entity5 's smart watch is ice - cold			1
" you wo n't find any copies of the smart watch here			2
i 've never seen or heard of any , " said a young man who was busy shipping off boxes , that he said were filled with counterfeit mobile phones , at a local logistics center			0
" thinking about it , i 've never even seen anyone wear one , " he added			0
the launch of @entity5 's @entity83 seemed like something of a victory against its big rival @entity45 , which is rumored to be launching its @entity86 sometime this year , but the device was conspicuous by its absence in @entity90 's market halls , logistic companies and workshops			1
" i 've never seen a knock - off gear in this whole town , " said a young woman working in a shop full of @entity5 products			0
her shop is one of the few outlets that sell the real gear but she said " they do n't sell well			0
" " [ @entity109 ] do n't care about the gear as consumer demand is too weak , " said another shop assistant in his early twenties , who was selling a number of what he said were real @entity5 products , but not the smart watch			0
" we do n't sell it anymore			0
" priced at around $ 300 , @entity9 consumers find @entity5 's new gadget too expensive , he added			2
out of 20 shops visited by @entity20 , not one sold fake @entity83 smart watches and none could offer leads on where to find copies			1
all these 20 shops sold the smart watch , out of hundreds perhaps thousands , of market booths that did n't sell @entity5 's @entity83			2
however , many of the same shops openly promoted copies of @entity45 's latest iphone and the @entity128 -- models also launched in september -- suggesting the counterfeiters are quick to copy if they see market potential			2
warning signal the lack of copy versions of the gear is a " serious warning signal , " according to @entity140 , a management professor at the @entity141 in @entity142 , who has spent years studying the global piracy phenomena			1
" piracy is all about benefiting from buzz -- create something good enough that looks like the real deal , and make money off those who are not willing or able to pay for the authentic item but who still want to be ' with it			0
' " without the buzz , there 's no need for the counterfeit , and it seems like @entity5 's smart watch has n't quite gotten the buzz going			2
" this does n't mean that the @entity162 smart watch is a complete bust , rather that it primarily speaks to a small group of gadget enthusiasts who will pay to get the real deal , rather than to the mass market			2
" so this is n't necessarily a disaster for @entity5 , but definitively a serious warning signal as the @entity33 crowd is the bellwether for electronics consumption			1
" it 's not uncommon for top - selling products to be on the market before launch of the original ; there were pirated iphone - lookalikes on the market months before the first @entity130 launched , @entity140 added			1
likewise , unpopular products are unceremoniously dropped by pirates who simply can not afford to get stuck with the inventory ; there are stories about how new @entity187 models basically were discontinued by counterfeiters before the genuine article even made it to market , according to @entity140			1
" this is a warp - speed market economy , where every product faces an ' up or out ' decision on a daily basis			0
competition is brutal , " he added			0
in an email to @entity20 , @entity5 said that @entity4 received " positive consumer feedback globally " and that 800,000 units were sold in the first two months after its release			0
however , @entity5 's head of @entity203 , @entity202 , told a conference in november that the gear is still a " small green tomato " that has not yet matured into something special			0
@entity9 's pirate community seems to agree .			1

wearable gadgets like smart watches are billed as the next big thing in technology
however , @entity9 's tech counterfeiters appear to shun the category
business expert @entity140 says this is a warning signal for market players
" knock offs " act as bellwether for electronics consumption , he says
