-- beloved photo app @entity2 turned 3 years old on monday			1
in tech startup years , that 's the equivalent of becoming a teenager			0
like most teens , it seems it 's time for @entity2 to start pulling some of its own weight and earning money			1
last week , the company announced it will begin dropping ads into photo streams in the @entity14			1
the advertisements will roll out gradually sometime in the next two months			1
some people are upset about the commercialization of their favorite free internet service			1
but either because it 's difficult to complain in the form of desaturated photos , or because the announcement has been expected for quite some time , the outrage is muted			0
people have become used to free online services adding ads. the shock of @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity31 's " selling - out " by adding advertising have trained people to expect some sort of business plan to pop up eventually			0
if successful , ads could be quite a lucrative plan			0
@entity2 could be pulling in more than $ 400 million annually from ads three to four years from now , according to @entity39 , an analyst at @entity40			1
@entity28 purchased @entity2 a year ago for around $ 700 million in stock			1
at the time , some critics said the cost was too high for a company not yet making money			0
" in hindsight , the @entity2 acquisition was brilliant , " said @entity39			1
" in today 's market , if @entity2 was still independent , they would have to pay much more for it			2
" @entity2 will have to tread lightly with its ads. the mobile - based photo - sharing service has seen explosive growth in recent years and now has 150 million people checking in at least monthly			1
still , there are plenty of eager new social apps ready to pick up any dissatisfied customers			0
" these companies have to really worry about the user experience			0
once you lose the user base you wo n't get any revenue from advertisers , " said @entity39			0
@entity2 has experienced push - back from its audience before			2
nine months ago , it updated its privacy policy and terms of service to include some new language that mentioned advertising			2
there was outrage and confusion over whether users ' photos could appear in ads without permission			2
the company had to dial back the language and issue a clarifying follow - up post			0
quality and volume of ads will be key to avoiding another uprising			2
@entity2 is easing its audience into the new reality with some very lovely descriptions of what it will feel like to experience an ad on @entity2			2
people will see a handful of " beautiful , high - quality photos and videos from a handful of brands that are already great members of the @entity2 community , " the company said in a blog post announcing the ads. though they have n't been able to buy ads on @entity2 , many brands , including @entity88 , @entity89 and @entity90 , already use it extensively as a marketing tool			1
the quality of @entity2 ads will likely be higher than what fills @entity28			1
the clip - art awfulness of many @entity28 ads makes them easy to spot and dismiss			0
ideally , @entity2 ads will require advertisers to submit high - quality photos and videos that blend into the regular flow of sunset , baby , food and vacation photos in a stream			1
one out - of - place " one weird trick " weight - loss ad with cartoon art would be jarring			0
" our aim is to make any advertisements you see feel as natural to @entity2 as the photos and videos many of you already enjoy from your favorite brands , " said the post			0
you can already feel the warm glow of a gently served advertisement washing over you .			0

@entity2 is turning 3 years old and *introducing* ads to its free service
the company plans to roll out ads slowly in the @entity14 over the next two months
to avoid alienating users , the service will have to control the quality and amount of ads
