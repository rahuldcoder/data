-- your city is @entity4 's blank canvas , and it 's no longer spray cans he is painting with			1
as a graffiti - obsessed tearaway teenager in the @entity9 city of @entity10 , @entity4 used to paint the town red , as well as blue , yellow , white and any other color he could get his hands on			1
hauled in front of the @entity9 courts after one particular spree , the then 15 - year - old was slapped with a $ 33,000 fine , one his distraught parents were unable to cover			1
it was a brush with the law that would thrust @entity4 towards his destiny as a bmx freestyle trailblazer			1
" my parents did n't have a lot of money -- i killed them with that , " the man who describes himself on @entity28 as a " clown @entity30 rider from the cheesiest country in the universe " told @entity0 's @entity35 series			2
" my dad was really scared , he had no money			2
he was not really angry against me but he said ' dude , we are done , all the family is done ' and i was like ' @entity42			2
' i thought ' i just need money and i need to do something to get out of this situation			0
' " i started riding really seriously because there was a bmx tour contest in @entity9 with a car to win , so my aim was to win this car , then to sell it , pay my fine			1
" i did it , so then i thought i 'm going to keep riding bmx and live like that			0
" so in the best traditions of guerrilla art forms , @entity4 continues to carve his own arcs through the environment around him , grinding rails and finding flow and meaning in functional structures			1
a legacy of broken bones is a small price to pay for the exhilaration it brings him and the people lucky enough to watch him at work			0
@entity4 has a string of titles to his name , and a cherished fourth place at the @entity74 in @entity75 this year			1
his desire to push the parameters of what is possible on a bike serve as a unique blend between @entity53 and the principles of @entity82 -- where free - runners vault , jump and glide over and around the urban landscape			1
" maybe i 'm a little bit better than the others at @entity53 because i 'm less scared and i 'm determined , " he said			1
" it 's about pushing the limits and finding new things to do all the time			0
if you 've got a new spot you will find new things to do			0
" in bmx freestyle there are different types of riding , there is the street -- you ride on the street -- there is dirt -- you ride on jumps -- you can ride in a skate park , you find everything you want in a small place , and then there is the flat land			2
" it 's like a dance with the bike on the floor			0
for me i ride street , skate park and dirt			0
and i just want to do my best on all of them			0
" polished videos of @entity4 's skills are stuffed full of tricks ; one moment he might be sliding backwards down the handrail of a flight of stairs , the next leaping into the air after whizzing round the curve of a defenseless @entity10 building			1
but some also showcase the often unseen trial and error stage , when @entity4 's bike and body end in a crumpled heap on the floor			1
it is a painful necessity in the process of trying to perfect a new trick			0
" sometimes it takes a long time for your brain to make your body do it , " @entity4 said			1
" sometimes i just think about one trick for two months , and one day , when i feel good , i try the trick and it works like that ! just pull it			2
maybe i will crash one time , two times , then i will pull it			0
" i think the hardest part of @entity53 is to be injured all the time			1
as soon as you ride , as soon as you try something , you can be sure to have a small cut on your leg or to be hurt somewhere			0
" i had a lot of injuries : a popped out shoulder , a twisted knee , a broken foot , surgery on my ankle			0
i have been knocked out maybe 10 times , i broke my nose when i was young , broke my arm when i was young			0
" with bmx you need to crash , you need to fall to learn new tricks			2
as soon as you ride you will be hurt a little bit so you will be all the time injured			0
" it was at the age of nine that @entity4 's interest in @entity53 was piqued by a magazine article			1
after a year spent pinching his sister 's bike , he got his own and after nailing down the basics , learnt his trade on the deserted streets of @entity10 under the cloak of darkness			1
" when i started riding a lot at 15 , i loved to hang out in the city alone during the night and ride street all the time , " he explained			2
" it was chilled , it was calm , during the night there is no - one on the street , everyone is in front of the tv with their families			1
" it was weird -- it seems like you have the entire city for you , if you ride @entity10 at 3am , there is no one on the street and you can do whatever you want -- i love that			1
" it inspired me because there is a real atmosphere on the street			0
i am scared about nature , i would hate to be in the forest alone and ride but i love being on the street because of the atmosphere of the buildings			0
" i think it 's comfy ; it 's like i feel like home , it 's hot , i can stay on the street , it 's like my office			2
" as a pioneer of his chosen discipline , he is constantly protective of its integrity , and claims many of the current crop of freestylers in @entity9 are in it only for fame			1
" it 's about taking your bike and riding for pleasure , not to be famous , or make a video , it 's just about riding @entity53 , " he said			2
" i think with the internet -- @entity228 , @entity229 , @entity28 -- i think the kids ( have ) lost it , now when they go to the skate park they all have camera stuff to make videos			0
" i do the same and i think it 's normal , but in one way i think it 's sad because they 're in the skate park and they 're not even riding , they 're doing it to put their videos online and be famous			0
