@entity1 , @entity2 it was an unbecoming way for the @entity2 prime minister to begin the week			1
but when he emerged from a 30 - minute meeting with his @entity9 colleagues , called to discuss his possible removal as leader , @entity6 was still the @entity2 premier , if irretrievably damaged			1
when last week a member of @entity6 's party signaled his intention to move a motion to debate the leadership of the ruling party , shocks waves rippled through the body politic			1
elected just 17 months ago promising " adult government " after three years of backbiting , infighting and two leadership coups in the previous @entity25 government , unity was n't expected to be a problem @entity6 would face			1
but disunity set in quickly after a series of bad decisions , policy flip flops , poor polling and as they say in @entity2 , a " zinger " -- the knighting of prince @entity34 , the @entity35 's husband , on @entity2 's national day			0
@entity6 won monday 's ballot , with 61 out of 102 of his colleagues voting down the motion to remove him , while 39 voted to vacate his position , along with that of his deputy , the foreign minister @entity43			1
the principle of cabinet solidarity meant the prime minister went in to the meeting with nearly 40 votes secured			1
despite a significant block of lawmakers opposing their leader , the @entity9 's whip , @entity51 , a former immigration minister , said there was no debate and that " the result is clear			2
" the meeting originally scheduled for tuesday was brought forward a day , to prevent the prime minister 's detractors caucusing in @entity58 ahead of the first week of parliament this year			1
the move was a " captain 's call " quipped his nemesis , the immensely popular communications minister @entity61 who was being urged to show his hand and pledge to stand for the top job in the event the motion to vacate the position was successful			2
in the end , @entity61 skated close to declaring his candidacy but stopped short			0
he would now have been obliged to resign from the @entity71 had he done so			0
he may well have won the vote , but the fact 39 out of 102 members of the party have declared a lack of confidence in their prime minister leaves @entity6 very exposed			1
in recent @entity2 political history , no leader who has faced such a challenge , itself a vote of no confidence , has gone on to survive the wrath of colleagues			2
all have eventually been overthrown			0
but for now @entity6 has at least spared himself the indignity of becoming the shortest serving first term prime minister ousted by his own party			1
while lawmakers remain angry by his failure to sell the government 's first budget , which has stalled in the country 's upper house , @entity6 has been accused of not consulting his colleagues on big decisions , among them a botched paid maternity leave scheme , widely seen as favoring the wealthy , and the bizarre knighting of prince @entity34			1
he seemed to consolidate this view of him as a non-collegiate player by calling monday 's vote a day earlier than anticipated and without apparent consultation , even with his deputy whose job would also have been vacated had the no - confidence vote succeeded			1
@entity2 have looked on at the shenanigans in their capital with a mixture of delight and dismay			0
those who dislike the government were divided by a desire to see the end of @entity6 's government and the fear that replacing him with @entity61 would spell disaster for the @entity25 's chances at the next election			2
others raised concerns about tossing out leaders when unpopular decisions are taken			0
@entity125 political commentator @entity124 noted that the apparently new political culture of tossing out leaders who make unpopular decisions was damaging the ability of government to govern			0
" the politicians will try to deny it -- but our system is moving inexorably into a ' death of reform ' straitjacket , " he wrote			0
the 2016 election is likely to be dominated by political advice to @entity9 and @entity25 not to provoke the voters			0
this will put @entity2 on a long - run trajectory of decline and growing unhappiness			0
there is broad agreement that frequent leadership changes are not good for @entity2			0
but that is no guarantee that @entity6 can and will survive to battle the next election			2
indeed , monday 's vote suggests strongly he wo n't .			0

prime minister @entity6 survives a vote of no confidence in his own party by 61 - 39
he has *accumulated* *critics* over a stalled budget among other things
@entity6 was elected as prime minister of *australia* in *september* 2013
