-- the media verdict is in : @entity2 is cursed			1
less than four months after taking the oath of office for the second time , he is seen as falling prey to some mysterious witchcraft that casts a fatal spell on re-elected presidents			0
" @entity11 suffer the ' second - term curse ' ? " asks the @entity10			1
" president @entity2 stares down the second - term curse , " says @entity13			1
and such stories ricocheted onto @entity17 's " today " show , on which , we learned , " some observers " are questioning whether " mr. @entity2 is falling victim to the second - term curse			1
" one can almost conjure up a bubbling cauldron of black smoke with a wand - wielding wizard laughing diabolically			0
now , there 's no question that second - term presidents often stumble or run out of gas			1
but the punditry suggests a one - size - fits - all scenario that is n't borne out by history			0
what 's more , there 's a rush - to - judgment air to some of these pronouncements that implies his second term is on the verge of failure , with more than 3 1/2 years to go			1
it is n't hard to build the case that the president finds himself in a ditch			0
the almost offhanded disclosure that the @entity45 was targeting conservative and tea party groups for reviews of their tax - exempt status , and the revelation that a top agency official knew about this two years ago , is an outrage that carries disturbing echoes of @entity53			0
( now there 's a guy whose second term did n't turn out too well			2
) the @entity58 debacle ( which of course happened in @entity2 's first term ) finally gained traction after @entity62 reported that the administration 's misleading talking points after the fatal attack had been scrubbed to remove references to a group affiliated with @entity69 and @entity70 warnings about terrorism			1
republicans , meanwhile , have been making @entity2 's life miserable , defeating a modest measure on background checks for guns , slow - walking immigration legislation and refusing to vote for some @entity79 nominees			1
oh , and the economy is n't doing that well either			0
but does that amount to a jinxed second term , or the same kind of partisan standoff that has marked @entity2 's years in office ? a look back at recent second - termers makes clear that every set of problems is inherently different			1
@entity90 vowed to spend his political capital after winning in 2004 , but a move to privatize @entity93 quickly collapsed			2
the sluggish federal response to @entity95 sealed an image of the administration as incompetent , against the backdrop of a bloody @entity100 war			0
and he left office amid the financial crisis of 2008			0
@entity105 's second term blew up when the monica lewinsky scandal erupted and he got himself impeached			1
but less remembered is the pre-scandal year of 1997 , when the president and @entity108 's @entity72 hammered out an agreement to balance the budget for the first time in three decades			0
it was sex and lies that proved @entity105 's undoing , although his popularity remained high when he left office			2
in similar fashion , @entity119 's second term ran aground when the @entity121 exploded in late 1986			1
what has been overshadowed is the sweeping legislation on tax reform and overhauling immigration that he passed earlier in the year			0
and @entity119 's personal approval rating was sufficiently intact that he was able to hand over the office to his vice president			2
as for @entity2 , smart journalists are careful not to be definitive when writing their trend pieces			2
@entity13 says the recent setbacks " have left the president feeling deeply frustrated , even angry â € ” and eager to find a way to recapture the offensive			0
" the @entity10 piece describes his mounting woes as " diversions working against a president who is keenly aware of how little time he has left to achieve big things			0
" this brings us to the thing that every second - term president since @entity147 has indeed faced : a ticking clock			2
a re-elected commander - in - chief is a lame duck whose ability to reward and punish inevitably diminishes as his departure date approaches			0
and that , rather than any sinister voodoo , may be @entity2 's biggest problem as he tries to dig his way out of this ditch			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity160 .			2

@entity160 : media saying @entity2 is running into the " second - term curse "
he says it 's true @entity2 's running into trouble , but pundits ' rush to judgment *premature*
second - termers ( see @entity119 , @entity90 , @entity105 ) have *successes* along with stumbles , he says
@entity160 : @entity2 does face wind down of sway ; this could affect his impact more than errors
