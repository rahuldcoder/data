@entity3 @entity1 @entity0 says he was " happy " to lend his trademark synthesized voice to actor @entity6 , who portrays the @entity8 scientist in the drama about his life , " to give him a bit of a boost in his efforts to win an @entity16			1
" although , joked the 73 - year - old physicist , " unfortunately , @entity6 did not inherit my good looks			1
" @entity0 suffers from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( @entity20 ) , a degenerative disease that affects nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord			1
he irreversibly lost the ability to speak in 1985 after having a tube inserted into his windpipe during a bout of severe pneumonia and now communicates in instantly recognizable tones using an electronic speech synthesizer			0
" before i lost my voice , it was slurred , so only those close to me could understand [ it ]			2
but with the computer voice , i found i could give popular lectures , " @entity0 said			1
" although it gave me an @entity41 accent , i have kept that voice , because it 's now my trademark			1
" @entity0 's comments came as he gave a personal guided tour of @entity3 's @entity47 to 24 - year - old @entity49 - resident @entity48 , who beat more than 10,000 entrants in a competition to be named @entity3 's @entity52			1
@entity6 , 32 , has been nominated for an @entity53 for best actor for his uncanny transformation into @entity0			1
the actor has already picked up an armful of awards for the role , including both the @entity60 and @entity62 prizes for best actor , and is in the running to take home an @entity16 when the winners are announced on february 22			1
" @entity74 " follows @entity0 from the 1960s during his early days as a bright postgraduate student at @entity69 to the 1980s when he publishes the seminal " @entity73 , " and focuses on his relationship with his first wife @entity71 and his battle with @entity20			1
it is based on the memoir " travelling to @entity76 : my life with @entity0 , " written by @entity71 , who is played in the film by @entity79			2
initially , the filmmakers used a voice - box programmed to sound like the one @entity0 uses , but after watching an early screening , the physicist was so pleased that he allowed filmmakers to use his voice , according to @entity87			1
" he offered us his voice , " @entity6 told @entity87			1
" for me , that was the most wonderful thing			0
" the @entity8 actor has confessed to nerves about playing a living legend and told @entity93 that he always knew that his toughest critic would be @entity0			2
but when the lights came up @entity0 's nurse wiped a tear way from his face -- and he called the film " broadly true , " @entity93 reported			1
during the tour , @entity0 said the museum is one of his favorite places and " helped fuel " his fascination with physics			2
the physicist showed @entity109 items from the museum of particular significance to him , including a rare copy of @entity114 's @entity113 from 1687 and a reconstruction of a 1953 model of the famous double helix structure of @entity118 discovered by @entity119 and @entity120			2
" we are now entering a new phase of what might be called self - designed evolution in which we will be able to change and improve our dna , " he told her			0
" now that we have read the book of life , we can start writing in corrections , to make us more intelligent and better natured			0
" as well as meeting the science legend , @entity130 's @entity132 initiative , part of the " @entity144 " campaign , treated @entity48 to a private tour of @entity137 theater , a walk down the red carpet at the premiere of " @entity141 " and tea with @entity3 mayor @entity143			0
@entity48 did n't leave her meeting with @entity0 -- which she described as something she 'll " never forget " -- without taking the opportunity to ask him what he would change about the human race -- and what virtues he would magnify			2
" the human failing i would most like to correct is aggression			0
it may have had [ a ] survival advantage in cave man days ... but now it threatens to destroy us all			0
a major nuclear war would be the end of civilization , and maybe the end of the human race			0
" the quality i would most like to magnify is empathy			0
it brings us together in a peaceful loving state			0
" the eminent thinker finished the tour by telling her that he hoped the objects he 'd shown her would remind her to " hold on to that childlike wonder about what makes the universe exist			0
" " look up at the stars , and not down at your feet , " he said .			0
