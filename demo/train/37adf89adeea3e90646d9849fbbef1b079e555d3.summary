-- after " will - they - or - wo n't - they " comes , " what now ? " over five seasons , viewers of @entity6 's " @entity5 " have gotten to know @entity7 , a mystery writer paired up with detective @entity8 , and they 've solved one murder after another , all the while fans were hoping these two would finally get together			1
at the end of last season , they got their answer			0
after tv guide readers voted them the favorite tv couple ( not to mention the show placing in the top five favorites for @entity0 readers ) , it 's clear that audiences are invested in just where the writers plan to take @entity7 and @entity8			1
@entity0 spoke with " @entity7 's " creator @entity27 to find out why this couple and this lighthearted show have struck such a chord in a dark tv landscape			1
plus , we found out what 's to come leading into this spring 's 100th episode			1
@entity0 : how has this show evolved over five seasons ? @entity27 : any show evolves			1
hopefully we 've retained our core values			0
we 've had two characters who were forced together and there was friction , and sparks flew			0
of course , over time they got to know each other and a different story emerged -- this love story that 's tentative and goes in fits and starts			1
it 's been fun to mine that , but we 've maintained the basic core of the show - delivering a great relationship story through the device of the procedural with fun , interesting cases at the heart of it			1
but over five years , your characters do have to grow and evolve , otherwise it does n't stay fresh and it 's not honest , it 's not true			1
since this was always supposed to be a " will - they - wo n't - they " romantic arc , the characters have to grow together , and go through the natural process of a courtship that everybody does			0
@entity0 : to what extent did you map out the course of the show 's romance ? @entity27 : initially , you 're always hopeful just to stay on the air , and once you 're confident you 'll stay on the air , you start to chart it out			1
it was always our intention to get these characters together eventually , but part of the fun is how can you keep them apart naturally ? i did n't have a firm date [ for the relationship to start ] when we launched into it			0
you kind of feel your way through and see what the rhythm is and how the show is evolving			2
at a certain point i believe you start testing your viewers ' patience when they have a vested interest in it			0
i 've never believed in the " curse of ' moonlighting ' " or all those concerns people had about getting them together			0
@entity0 : why do you think audiences love this couple and this show ? @entity27 : anybody who 's been in a relationship understands the give and take			1
there 's always some fun friction there			2
you 're also attracted to the things you are n't , so the things that you love are sometimes the things that drive you crazy			0
in a universe of procedurals that are pretty dark , the fact that you can deal with this form in a more lighthearted way is a relief for people			1
after a hard day 's work , you turn on " @entity124 , " you 're in the darkest place possible with people trying to solve this crime			2
i was getting to the point when i was conceiving this , thinking i do n't want to bring that into the universe			0
i wanted to bring in something joyous even though we 're dealing with murder			0
i go back to a show like " @entity137 " where it 's life or death stakes in the operating room , but there 's also that gallows humor and that humanity			1
hopefully we 're finding that tonal balance in " @entity5			1
" @entity0 : has @entity146 and @entity148 's chemistry surprised you over the years ? @entity27 : @entity146 was generous enough to sit with us as we read 125 or 130 actresses			2
there was something special in the connection that he and @entity148 had			0
there was a tension that was fun and interesting -- it was that lightning in a bottle chemistry that you look for , and we were fortunate to get it			0
we were thrilled with what we had			0
@entity0 : what made @entity146 right for the role ? @entity27 : the reason i thought he would be good here is this would be a character that would allow him to play everything he 's good at			2
this would allow him to be dramatic ; this would allow him to be funny ; this would allow him to be charming			0
the role is written to show the different aspects of what it means to be a man : to be a lover , a long suffering son , a tremendous father , a man 's man , to hang out with the boys			1
the role is written to see all those facets			0
if we only saw him annoying @entity8 , or the narcissism he has , he would come across as very unattractive			1
the nice thing about the show is we get to see all the facets of the diamond			2
@entity0 : what do you have coming up ? @entity27 : we 're currently working on the 100th episode , but we have some big storytelling before then			1
traditionally we have a two - parter this time of year			0
@entity7 's daughter ends up being kidnapped and put into a very difficult situation			1
we play a lot of it from @entity7 's point of view , trying to get her back			1
it 's a tremendous performance by @entity146			2
after the two - parter , we 're doing a little nod to the horror genre , centered around a haunted videotape			0
@entity7 sees it and is convinced he 's going to be dead in 48 hours			1
it 's a ride ; it 's a lot of fun			2
we find out @entity215 has a past going undercover in narcotics , and he ends up having to go undercover again			0
it turns out he 's a very different person undercover			2
later on this season , we have a murder where it looks like the only credible suspect is @entity222 , which sends us on a @entity222 hunt			0
we like to lean into the genre and end up with a real world explanation			0
for the 100th we wanted the quintessential ' @entity7 ' show -- something that was fun , something with great @entity230 stuff in it			1
we 're really excited with the direction it 's going in .			2
