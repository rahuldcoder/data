@entity0 , @entity1 -- no one disputes @entity4 carried his newborn @entity5 through the maternity ward of a suburban @entity7 and tried to take the baby outside			1
nor is there any question an altercation ensued , involving nurses attempting to keep the baby on the floor			0
but beyond that , there are only open questions -- especially about why it all happened and who is to blame			2
answers finally started to trickle in on monday , as the trial of the late @entity23 's youngest son began with opening statements and four witnesses taking the stand			1
judge @entity27 -- not a jury -- is hearing the case involving misdemeanor charges of harassment and child endangerment			1
kicking off the trial , the two sides outlined significantly divergent scenarios of what happened last january at @entity37			0
according to assistant district attorney @entity39 , the nurses were simply following protocol set up in newborns ' interests when they tried to keep baby @entity5 from leaving the hospital			0
the infant 's father not only did n't back down , but he fought back -- even twisting one nurse 's arm and kicking another -- the prosecutor said			1
one of the nurses , @entity50 , testified monday that she 'd initially reached in to hold open an elevator door to prevent @entity4 from leaving that way			1
when he headed toward a stairway door , she ran to it and put her hand on the doorknob			0
" i had my hand behind my back and he grabbed my left hand -- which was on the doorknob -- and twisted my arm , " said @entity58			1
@entity4 raised his foot and kicked another nurse , @entity66 , who 'd come to help before entering the stairway , @entity58 added			1
but he only got down as far as the next landing , where he was met by security			0
the defense team was tough on the nurse			2
suggesting she had an ulterior motive given @entity4 's high profile , lawyer @entity75 questioned a tearful @entity58 why -- if recounting her story was so emotionally difficult -- she had recounted her version of what happened so soon after the incident on @entity83 's " @entity82			1
" fellow defense lawyer @entity85 , in her opening statement , suggested @entity4 was calm and that the situation only deteriorated because of @entity58			1
any contact with the nurses was due to a father 's instinctual reflex to " keep someone from ripping his baby from his arms , " the attorney added			0
" ( @entity58 ) was abrasive , confrontational and changed the entire tone of the discussion ... and wanted to let him know who was in charge of his baby , " @entity95 said			2
the incident occurred at the hospital in @entity0 , located about 40 miles north of @entity102 and where this week 's trial is taking place			0
after @entity4 was arraigned in february , his attorney released a statement stating that nurses initially agreed to let him take the baby outside and demanding " appropriate disciplinary action " be taken against @entity58 and @entity110			2
@entity111 , a doctor at the hospital and longtime family friend who was with @entity4 at the time , asserted in the statement that " nurses were the only aggressors			2
" but neither nurse recognized @entity4 as the child 's father and intended to protect the baby , who apparently had not been discharged , according to @entity121 , the attorney for both nurses			1
they were trying to enforce hospital rules , he said			0
the hospital , in @entity1 's @entity125 , issued its own statement in february supporting its nurses			0
" at @entity37 , patient safety is our priority and we completely support the actions of our nursing staff in this case as they were clearly acting out of concern for the safety of a newborn baby			0
" the late @entity23 was the younger brother of slain president @entity138 and had served as @entity140 attorney general and @entity140 senator			1
he was assassinated in 1968 while campaigning for the @entity143 presidential nomination			0
@entity2 's @entity144 reported from @entity0 and @entity145 from @entity146 .			0
