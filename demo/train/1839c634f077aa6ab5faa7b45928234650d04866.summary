@entity0 -- the @entity2 , the most prestigious yachting race in the world and its oldest at 162 years , will seemingly join the aviation age this weekend when a new design of boat sails as fast as 52 mph			1
the sight of these modern catamarans -- whose mainsail is even called a " wing " -- has been described as " flying " sailboats because the hulls will rise out of the water and ride on hydrofoils , moving faster than the wind itself			2
as one race skipper said in the race 's promotions , " once the boat foils , it 's like hitting a turbo button in a car			1
" if this spectacle seems mind - boggling , it 's intended : the @entity2 is better known for its old - fashioned sailboats -- the sloop , which has one hull with a fabric mainsail -- that in 2007 reached a top average speed of 14 mph , or 12 knots			1
now the organizers of @entity2 -- led by @entity36 executive @entity35 , whose @entity38 team won the last championship in 2010 -- have transformed the sport into " a new - age speedster " event , designed to draw new audiences to international sport 's oldest trophy , which predates the modern @entity46 by 45 years			1
to lure spectators , the @entity2 is being held for the first time inshore , not offshore , in @entity49 , where gusty winds and a scenic shoreline are part of a strategy to make the regatta a sensational made - for - tv sport			1
as to be expected with such grand plans , however , the new @entity2 is roiling in controversy and concerns that its thrill - seeking is just too deadly			2
one sailor was killed in may while practicing for the race in the bay aboard the @entity66 @entity65 team 's boat when it capsized in winds only a little above normal at 25 to 35 mph			1
@entity68 , 36 , was a double @entity46 medalist			0
the race has a high financial price , too -- scaring off some racers			2
" we 've had our issues , we 've had our accidents , we 've had a tragic loss of life , " acknowledged @entity72 , regatta director of the 2013 @entity2			2
the cost to field a team -- around $ 100 million -- is being blamed for a smaller - than - expected field of challengers			0
the regatta begins saturday and could end september 14 at the earliest			0
entry requires a specially designed sailboat , called the @entity85 , the shorthand for the 72 - foot - long @entity2 catamarans			1
as such , it has become a billionaire 's pastime to build a boat and assemble a crew			2
the four boats vying for the @entity2 -- the smallest fleet in history -- mirror such wealth			2
@entity35 , the world 's fifth richest man , has again funded @entity38 in this year 's finals			2
@entity65 of @entity66 belongs to @entity99 , an oil entrepreneur in that country			0
@entity102 's @entity101 is backed by the head of the fashion house @entity104 , @entity106 , who is worth $ 6.7 billion			0
and the @entity109 team is financed by its government and @entity111 as well as other sponsors			0
critics say the 21st century marketing strategy of the race tarnishes the grand ol ' @entity2 , founded in 1851			1
" it was big money before			0
this time it 's mega-money , and that 's one of the failings of this edition of the @entity2			1
this one has just been too expensive for the times and too complicated in terms of the technology needed , " said @entity124 , an expert on sail racing who 's regarded as a historian of the @entity2			1
enthusiasts such as @entity124 were expecting as many as 15 teams , including from @entity134 , @entity135 and @entity136 , to seek the @entity2			1
that number did n't materialize			0
" i think people just said this is too hard for me			0
i ca n't win , " @entity124 said			0
race officials acknowledge how an expensive sport is getting more expensive , but that 's true for other sport teams , whether it 's baseball or football			1
" well , i think you can look at many sports -- you can look at a @entity151 team , a @entity153 team , you can look at a polo team -- you can spend that amount of money on a lot of different teams , " said regatta director @entity72			0
even so , he said he wished more boats sought this year 's @entity2			1
but the payoff could be legions of newcomers fascinated by speed and technology -- as well as the coastal vistas			0
@entity2 sailboats can reach 35 knots , or 40 mph , in winds of almost half that amount , at 18 knots or 21 mph			1
@entity171 reduce drag and boost speed			0
" there 's no denying that the hundreds of millions being spent are bringing a new excitement to the sport and perhaps some new fans as the final series of the @entity2 is about to get underway , " @entity72 added			1
a new era is unfurling in sailing , @entity72 said			0
though it 's strongly criticized , @entity72 defended the modernization of a world classic			0
" we have boats sailing around 50 mph -- which is unheard of in the history of sailing , " @entity72 said			2
" the way these guys are pushing these boats , it 's quite remarkable and a huge test of the competency of putting a crew together to race in the @entity2			1
so i look back and say it was the right decision			0

the @entity2 will feature a new design of boat , a catamaran with hydrofoils
the boat can sail 52 mph , " an unheard of " speed in sailboat racing
but fewer teams are entering the race because it 's now so expensive
race organizers defend their strategy to seek new audiences for the race
