-- as @entity2 prepares to return from its august recess , @entity1 is gearing up for a national conversation on the balance between security and liberty , between necessary surveillance and necessary privacy			1
that 's a good thing			1
it would be an even better thing if the discussion were based on fact rather than contaminated by inaccuracies and posturing			0
a quick review of recent commentary suggests that may not be likely			2
for example , @entity20 seems incapable of commenting on this story without the header " @entity26 , " a lead that brings with it its own conclusion			0
a prominent @entity28 senator recently opined that , " they ( the @entity30 ) basically i believe probably are looking at all the cell phone calls in @entity28 every day			1
" another lawmaker has already concluded that the @entity30 is " an agency out of control			1
" and a former congressman on a sunday talk show added to the sum total of human knowledge with this : " @entity39 ! hello ! i mean we have a @entity39			0
what 's the @entity30 really about ? " i fear that the coming debate will have all the characteristics of a mob -- thoughtless action driven by artificial urgency , unreasoning fear , emotion and misinformation			1
and that 's a pity since the heart of this issue has been around for years and deserves serious discussion			2
as far back as at least 2000 , the @entity30 tried to hit the real question head - on			2
the agency knew that past targets of its surveillance largely communicated on their own dedicated networks			0
there was hardly a civil libertarian alive who would be concerned about trying to intercept communications between the @entity64 high command in @entity65 and intercontinental ballistic missile silos beyond the @entity67			0
but the threats of the 21st century do not communicate on their own networks			0
terrorists , drug traffickers , arms proliferators and the like live on a unitary global information grid where their communications co-exist with the communications of the very people the @entity30 is committed to protecting			1
it was clear even pre- 9/11 that the @entity30 could not do its mission without working aggressively on this common grid			2
it was also clear that the agency would not have the power to do so -- legally , financially or technologically -- unless the @entity28 people were convinced that this power would be limited to its intended purpose , that even as constitutionally protected communications mingled with and were sorted from targeted communications , they would still be protected			1
and that basically is the issue of the moment , whether the headline is @entity93 , @entity94 , metadata , " upstream " communications , @entity97 or an alleged @entity30 secret room at an @entity100 facility in @entity101 -- all of which have been featured in recent coverage			1
@entity28 will have to decide what constitutes a " reasonable " expectation of privacy and what running room they will give their government to search for the signals almost everyone agrees should be captured even as those signals co-exist with their own			2
although @entity2 , the courts and two administrations have authorized what the @entity30 is doing today , these are not easy issues			2
resolution will hinge on how much trust people have in their government , or at least this part of it			0
it will also hinge on how much danger with which people are willing to live			0
and if this is to be a fact - based discussion , resolution will also hinge on how well citizens understand a few basics of what exactly is being done			0
unfortunately , much of the public discourse is confused to the point of incoherence			0
take the question of authorities			0
how does the @entity30 get the power to do any of this ? in most instances , since this is about foreign intelligence , authority comes from the president and is codified in @entity140			1
only when a @entity28 person is involved or for certain kinds of collection in the @entity28 does the agency have to rely on the @entity145 and the court it established			1
most intelligence collection -- by the @entity30 , @entity39 or any intelligence agency -- is not overseen by a court			1
oversight comes from the president and the @entity2			0
but it is still oversight			0
breathless claims that some things are done without court review could well be true -- and not very relevant			0
then there is collection involving @entity28			2
most casual commentators simply assert that anytime the @entity30 is listening to an @entity28 , the agency must have a warrant			1
indeed , trying to calm current concerns , president @entity163 told @entity165 that , absent a warrant , " what i can say unequivocally is that if you are a @entity28 person , the @entity30 can not listen to your telephone calls			1
... " actually , that 's not quite correct -- and never has been			0
as the president suggested later in the interview , the @entity30 can not target the communications of a @entity28 person			1
if it is tracking the communications of a legitimate foreign intelligence target and that target talks to an @entity28 , the @entity30 indeed covers it -- and always has			1
picture a known terrorist who makes a series of operational calls to confederates in say @entity185 , @entity186 and the @entity187			0
to suggest that the @entity30 has to stop coverage of the last call is ludicrous			2
this is what the @entity30 calls incidental collection of information to , from or about a @entity28 person			1
when this occurs -- and it is not rare -- the agency is required to keep its focus on the foreign intelligence in the communication and minimize or mask the @entity28 identity unless the identity is essential to the intelligence ( as it would be in the example above )			1
keep this in mind when commentators claim that the @entity30 has collected the content of @entity28 e-mails or phone calls			1
that may be , but the @entity30 is not targeting them without a warrant			2
and then there are the numbers			0
like the @entity218 's august 15 headline screaming , " @entity30 broke privacy rules thousands of times per year , audit finds			1
" you have to dig deeper to learn ( as i pointed out in another piece ) that all of the incidents were inadvertent ; no one is claiming that any rules were intentionally violated ; and all of the incidents were discovered , reported and corrected by the @entity30 itself			1
in one example , the @entity218 referred to " large numbers of data base query incidents			0
" the @entity30 later confirmed that in one quarter there indeed were 115 incidents of @entity30 queries being incorrectly entered , mistakes such as mistyping or using overly broad search criteria			2
that 's 115 out of more than 61 million inquiries made in that quarter , a compliance rate of .999998			0
in this , as in most issues , facts ( and context ) matter			0
understanding beyond the accusatory headline or the facile quip is needed , or we will be just tossing slogans at one another , slinging volleys of hyperbole , stoking fears and anger and distrust , all of which will make it even more difficult to resolve an already very difficult question			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity263 .			2

@entity263 : it 's good for @entity28 to discuss balance between liberty and security
former @entity30 *director* says much has been *misunderstood* in recent debate on agency
he says @entity28 are only surveilled when in contact with foreign agents
@entity263 : violations of rules were discovered by @entity30 , represent tiny *fraction* of communications
