-- little more than a year after he resigned in disgrace as prime minister , @entity1 is campaigning to win his old job back -- for the fourth time			1
@entity1 , the septuagenarian playboy billionaire nicknamed " @entity1 , " has been trailing in polls behind his center - left rival , @entity6			1
but the controversial media tycoon 's rise in the polls in recent weeks , combined with widespread public disillusionment and the quirks of @entity13 's complex electoral system , means that nothing about the race is a foregone conclusion			1
why have the elections been called now ? @entity13 parliamentarians are elected for five - year terms , with the current one due to end in april			1
however in december , @entity1 's @entity20 ( @entity21 ) withdrew its support from the reformist government led by @entity24 , saying it was pursuing policies that " were too @entity26 - centric			1
" @entity24 subsequently resigned and the parliament was dissolved			0
@entity1 -- the country 's longest serving post-war leader -- had resigned the prime ministerial office himself amidst a parliamentary revolt in november 2011			1
he left at a time of personal and national crisis , as @entity13 grappled with sovereign debt problems and @entity1 faced criminal charges of tax fraud , for which he was subsequently convicted			1
he remains free pending an appeal			0
he was also embroiled in a scandal involving a young nightclub dancer - which led him to be charged with paying for sex with an underage prostitute			0
he was replaced by @entity24 , a respected economist and former @entity43 commissioner , who was invited by @entity13 's president @entity44 to lead a cabinet of unelected technocrats			1
@entity24 's government implemented a program of tax rises and austerity measures in an attempt to resolve @entity13 's economic crisis			1
who are the candidates ? the election is a four - horse race between political coalitions led by @entity6 , @entity1 , @entity24 , and the anti-establishment movement led by ex-comedian @entity59			1
polls are banned within two weeks of election day , but the most recent ones had @entity6 holding onto a slender lead over @entity1 , followed by @entity59 in distant third			1

he is a former minister of economic development in @entity72 's government from 2006 - 8 -- and has held a comfortable lead in polls , but that appears to be gradually being eroded by @entity1			1
@entity13 's political system encourages the forming of alliances , and the @entity69 has teamed with the more left - wing @entity78			1
the 61 - year - old @entity6 comes across as " bluff and homespun , and that 's part of his appeal -- or not , depending on your point of view , " said political analyst @entity87 , department chair of international relations at the @entity90			1
he described @entity6 , a former communist , as a " revised apparatchik , " saying the reform - minded socialist was paradoxically " far more of a free marketeer than even people on the right			2
" @entity6 has vowed to continue with @entity24 's austerity measures and reforms , albeit with some adjustments , if he wins			2
at second place in the polls is the center - right alliance led by @entity1 's @entity21 , in coalition with the right - wing , anti-immigration @entity104			1
@entity1 has given conflicting signals as to whether he is running for the premiership , indicating that he would seek the job if his coalition won , but contradicting that on other occasions			2
in a recent speech , he proposed himself as @entity112 , and the @entity21 secretary @entity113 as prime minister			0
@entity115 , leader of the @entity104 , has said the possibility of @entity1 becoming prime minister is explicitly ruled out by the electoral pact between the parties , but the former premier has repeatedly said he plays to win , and observers believe he is unlikely to pass up the chance to lead the country again if the opportunity presents itself			2
@entity1 has been campaigning as a @entity126 court weighs his appeal against a tax fraud conviction , for which he was sentenced to four years in jail last year			2
the verdict will be delivered after the elections ; however , under the @entity13 legal system , he is entitled to a further appeal in a higher court			2
because the case dates to july 2006 , the statute of limitations will expire this year , meaning there is a good chance none of the defendants will serve any prison time			0
he is also facing charges in the prostitution case ( and that he tried to pull strings to get her out of jail when she was accused of theft ) -- and in a third case stands accused of revealing confidential court information relating to an investigation into a bank scandal in 2005			0
despite all this , he retains strong political support from his base			0
" @entity13 is a very forgiving society , it 's partly to do with @entity156 , " said @entity87			2
" there 's sort of a ' live and let live ' idea			0
" @entity24 , the country 's 69 - year - old technocrat prime minister , who had never been a politician before he was appointed to lead the government , has entered the fray to lead a centrist coalition committed to continuing his reforms			0
the alliance includes @entity24 's @entity165 for @entity24 , the @entity166 and a smaller centre - right party , @entity168			0
as a " senator for life , " @entity24 is guaranteed a seat in the senate and does not need to run for election himself , but he is hitting the hustings on behalf of his party			0
in a climate of widespread public disillusionment with politics , comedian and blogger @entity59 is also making gains by capturing the protest vote with his @entity182			0
@entity59 has railed against big business and the corruption of @entity13 's political establishment , and holds broadly euro - skeptical and pro-environmental positions			1
how will the election be conducted ? @entity13 has a bicameral legislature and a voting system which even many @entity13 say they find confusing			2
voters will be electing 315 members of the @entity192 , and 630 members of the @entity194			0
both houses hold the same powers , although the @entity192 is referred to as the upper house			0
under the country 's closed - list proportional representation system , each party submits ranked lists of its candidates , and is awarded seats according to the proportion of votes won -- provided it passes a minimum threshold of support			2
seats in the @entity194 are on a national basis , while seats in the senate are allocated on a regional one			0
the party with the most votes are awarded a premium of bonus seats to give them a working majority			0
the prime minister needs the support of both houses to govern			0
who is likely to be the next prime minister ? on current polling , @entity6 's bloc looks the likely victor in the @entity194			2
but even if he maintains his lead in polls , he could fall short of winning the @entity192 , because of the rules distributing seats in that house on a regional basis			0
crucial to victory in the @entity192 is winning the region of @entity235 , the industrial powerhouse of the north of @entity13 which generates a fifth of the country 's wealth and is a traditional support base for @entity1			1
often compared to the @entity243 state of @entity244 for the " kingmaker " role it plays in elections , @entity235 has more @entity192 seats than any other region			0
if no bloc succeeds in controlling both houses , the horse - trading begins in search of a broader coalition			0
@entity87 said that a coalition government between the blocs led by @entity6 and @entity24 seemed " almost inevitable , " barring something " peculiar " happening in the final stages of the election campaign			0
@entity1 , he predicted , would " get enough votes to cause trouble			0
" what are the main issues ? there 's only really one issue on the agenda at this election			0
the eurozone 's third largest economy is hurting , with unemployment surpassing 11 % -- and hitting 37 % for young people			1
voters are weighing the question of whether to continue taking @entity24 's bitter medicine of higher taxation and austerity measures , while a contentious property tax is also proving a subject of vexed debate			0
@entity87 said the dilemma facing @entity13 was deciding between " who 's going to look after the country better , or who 's going to look after my pocket better			2
" he said it appeared voters held far greater confidence in the ability of @entity24 and @entity6 to fix the economy , while those swayed by appeals to their own finances may be more likely to support @entity1			1
but he said it appeared that few undecided voters had any faith in @entity1 's ability to follow through on his pledges , including a recent promise to reverse the property tax			2
what are the ramifications of the election for @entity43 and the wider world ? improving the fortunes of the world 's eighth largest economy is in the interests of @entity43 , and in turn the global economy			1
@entity13 's woes have alarmed foreign investors			1
however , financial commentator @entity313 , managing director of consultancy @entity314 , says the @entity316 's bond - buying program has gone a long way to mitigating investors ' concerns about the instability of @entity13 politics			1
why is political instability so endemic to @entity13 ? @entity13 has had more than 60 governments since @entity324 -- in large part as a by - product of a system designed to prevent the rise of another dictator			1
parties can be formed and make their way on to the political main stage with relative ease -- as witnessed by the rise of @entity59 's @entity182 , the protest party which was formed in 2009 but in local and regional elections has even outshone @entity338 's party at times			0
others point to enduringly strong regional identities as part of the recipe for the country 's political fluidity			1
