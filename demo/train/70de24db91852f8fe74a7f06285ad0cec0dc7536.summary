@entity0 has come out with a new image that could become one of its most iconic ever			1
the @entity4 revisited the so - called " @entity5 , " which the space agency describes as " three giant columns of cold gas bathed in the scorching ultraviolet light from a cluster of young , massive stars in a small region of the @entity13 , or @entity13			1
" the previous photo of these pillars , taken in 1995 , went on to stand out from all the rest of @entity0 's space images , the agency said			1
" the @entity4 image is so popular that it has appeared in movies and television shows , on t - shirts and pillows , and even on a postage stamp			1
" in celebration of the telescope 's upcoming 25th anniversary in april , @entity4 returned to the pillars -- and this time with the latest high - definition tools			1
the new sharper and wider image was taken " in near - infrared light , as well as visible light , " @entity0 said			2
" the infrared view transforms the pillars into eerie , wispy silhouettes seen against a background of myriad stars			2
that 's because the infrared light penetrates much of the gas and dust , except for the densest regions of the pillars			0
newborn stars can be seen hidden away inside the pillars			0
" in 1995 , the captured image gave insight into star formation			1
" nebulous star - forming regions like @entity13 are the interstellar neon signs that say , ' we just made a bunch of massive stars here , ' " said @entity45 of @entity46 , who helped lead the original observations , in a post on @entity0 's website			0
the new image " hints " that these columns " are also pillars of destruction , " @entity0 said			2
" the ghostly bluish haze around the dense edges of the pillars is material getting heated up and evaporating away into space , " said @entity45			0
" we have caught these pillars at a very unique and short - lived moment in their evolution			0
" 8 new planets found in ' @entity70 '			0

a 1995 image of the " @entity5 " became iconic
the new images give an even more *spectacular* view -- and new insight
