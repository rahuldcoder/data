-- in the @entity2 , camels made for a very useful literary device			0
primarily , they represent great wealth ; when @entity7 journeys to @entity8 , the @entity6 offers him a huge bounty , including sheep , servants and -- the @entity12 -- camels , in exchange for @entity7 's wife , @entity14 ( though in fairness , the @entity6 thought they were siblings )			1
camels are used later to demonstrate @entity7 's own riches ( acquired later in life ) , and ultimately , the good heart of his future daughter - in - law , @entity19 , who is chosen after she kindly offers the beasts of burden some water			1
though these animals play a central role in @entity27 , new evidence has called into question their existence in @entity30 during the lifespans of @entity7 and his immediate descendents ( believed to be between 2000 - 1500 @entity33 ) , and with it , the authorship of the bible			2
professors @entity39 and @entity41 , archaeologists from @entity38 in @entity30 , recently published a study after radiocarbon dating camel bones uncovered during excavations in the @entity45 -- an area on the border of @entity30 and the @entity48 , and one of the most logical spots where camels would have first been introduced into the country			1
excavations uncovered the oldest camel bones yet found in @entity30 , and these dated no earlier than 940 @entity33 -- at least 500 years later than when they are described in the bible			1

the editor of these stories knew the camel was a draft animal used in his time for traveling across the desert , so of course @entity7 , @entity67 and @entity68 used camels			1
we call it an anachronism ; he projected the reality that he knew at his own time , " says @entity39			0
he is also quick to point out that though the stories may have been written later , his findings do not necessarily cast doubt on the tales themselves			0
" it does n't necessarily mean the stories are fiction or that there is no grain of truth in them			2
it does n't mean @entity7 was n't a real figure ; he can still be a real figure			0
it just means that the guy who put them into written form gave the background according to his realities			0
there were no archaeologists back then to tell the author that camels were not around			0

naturally , not all are in agreement with the study 's conclusions			2
@entity115 , a professor of @entity118 and ancient @entity117 languages at the @entity119 says that while he does n't doubt the radiocarbon dating , he does n't believe it disproves that camels existed in the @entity123			1
" the archaeologists were working in a valley south of the @entity126 , but the stories place @entity7 in @entity128 in @entity129 and in @entity130 in the area of @entity132 before coming to @entity133			0
the fact that there were no camel bones from before 1000 bc in the south of the land does n't mean there were no camels anywhere else , " he says			1

@entity115 says that though rare , there is evidence that camels were used domestically during that period , including a @entity154 seal from between 1800 and 1700 @entity33 carved in the style of @entity156 that depicts two deities sitting on a camel			2
despite the biblical debate the study has kicked off , @entity39 and @entity41 say the primary focus of the research was not to question @entity27 , but shed some light on the economic workings of the time			1
" the introduction of domestic camels enabled long journeys in the @entity169 , and all the way to @entity171			1
it represented profound socio - economic change , " says @entity172			0
" before then , they used donkeys , and they ca n't travel those long distances without water			2
it really opened up trade to the rest of the world			0

a new study dating the remains of camel bones has *spurred* a debate on the bible 's authorship
several stories in the bible depict camels being used for long journeys
archeologists from @entity38 say camels were n't domesticated until centuries after the biblical *references*
