@entity0 , @entity1 -- in terms of underground @entity1 art , @entity3 may be grabbing the headlines but he is just one artist in an expanding galaxy of edgy and sometimes provocative work that has been coming out of @entity1 's contemporary art scene for more than a decade			1
there 's @entity11 , better known as " naked push - up brother , " a performance artist who disrobes at the scenes of newsworthy scandals and catastrophes and pumps out a series of press - ups			2
there are the @entity20 , whose sculpture of a firing squad of @entity25 clones taking aim at a figure of @entity28 put them on the wrong side of @entity1 's increasingly skittish and jumpy authorities			1
and in southern @entity1 's @entity0 -- an unprepossessing industrial city famous for producing one in 10 of the knives and scissors found in @entity38 homes -- there 's the @entity40 ; a trio of seasoned drinkers whose work , while not overtly political , attacks one of the @entity1 culture 's sacred traditions -- calligraphy			1
" when i was at school , my teacher used to tell me how bad my handwriting was , " says @entity47 , an artist in his own right outside the group , but who has worked with the other two -- @entity54 and @entity55 -- for 10 years			2
" but then i thought , who is he to tell me that my calligraphy is bad ? " @entity1 works hard to project soft power in @entity1 , writing is considered an artform and is so important to the meaning of the words that the lyrical power of a poem , for instance , is carried through the style of the handwriting			1
the @entity40 likes to throw thousands of years of culture out of the window			1
" when we first started working together we used to drink and then by accident we found things that we 'd written that we could n't remember doing at the time , " says @entity47			0
he said the power and clarity of these calligraphic works impressed them so much that drinking became a pre-requisite for their @entity81 - like art jams , sometimes binge drinking for up to three days at a time			2
" when you 're in this mental situation you do n't remember what you 've done , " says @entity47			0
" it 's exactly this distance and unfamiliarity between your state of mind and what you are doing that draws you to a higher state of art. " the results are as hilarious as they are disturbing			2
@entity3 places himself under home surveillance often taking news events or the media as their inspiration , one piece entitled " @entity102 : masterpieces @entity108 , no. 1 : ' i need a new kidney to kill @entity106 ' " references @entity38 would - be assassin and dialysis patient @entity104 who launched a private mission to kill @entity106			1
another " @entity115 with the @entity116 " uses calligraphy to retell the shocking news story of a 16 - year - old girl who , in 1996 , was imprisoned for a week with two dozen male suspects who sexually abused her			2
@entity47 writes the text over an unrelated photograph of what appear to be binge - drinking revelers			0
as writing , the characters are often so sloppy that a viewer is forced to read the label to find out what the work is referring to			2
the group says the authorities take no interest in what they are doing and that the works amount to little more than a personal diary			1
nevertheless , their art not only challenges @entity1 's cultural heritage , it looks at the structures of power and how they work ; not least within calligraphy itself which is governed by what is known as " the 10 rules			1
" " i ca n't even remember what they are , " says @entity47 , laughing			0
" all i remember is that they were in our books at school			0
" @entity54 says writing in @entity1 is still a source of conflict , with simplified characters -- a system introduced under @entity25 which drastically reduced the number of strokes and characters in a bid to lift literacy -- still unable to take complete hold in the country even after more than 50 years			1
" before the revolution people used traditional characters and for those people that left , they do n't even know @entity1 characters , " @entity54 , who studied calligraphy at university , says			1
" these days you are forced to fill in official forms in simplified characters			0
" he says there 's a gravitational pull towards traditional script because the characters have a deeper cultural sense which he says comes shimmering out of the characters " like a mirage			2
" " most calligraphers habitually tend to write in traditional script , " says @entity54			0
" i think in 20 years or more @entity1 will return to traditional script			1
" not content with doing works merely on paper , the group has extended its anarchic world to architecture , constructing a sprawling studio in urban @entity0 that resembles an iceberg			1
the building , a work in progress , is constructed without plans -- rooms , stairwells and garden spaces are figured out day by day , depending on discussions with the builders			2
in the countryside , their architectural projects are even more ambitious			0
in a complex that draws its inspiration from the video game " @entity199 , " the group is working on a sprawling interconnected series of exhibition spaces , rooms and garden areas which requires a team of 10 full - time builders			2
the group has little in the way of official permission , instead dealing with planning problems as they arise			0
@entity47 says he even once made an exhibit of the receipts of the bribes he had to pay to various authorities to get his architectural projects through			0
kick backs in @entity1 are often demanded through semi-official means , for instance overly rigorous fire safety standards and the like			1
the group has a growing following in @entity38 and @entity220 galleries and says it now entirely funds its projects through its exhibitions			1
it is currently displaying its works in @entity224 in the @entity225			0
@entity227 - @entity226 , assistant professor of sociology at the @entity229 , whose work specializes in the @entity1 response to contemporary art , says the international market for provocative works from @entity1 is now so large it 's a growth industry the authorities are loathe to interrupt			1
" at the end of the day , they are not stopping this growth and they do n't want to stop it , " @entity226 says			0
" there are a lot of weird loopholes that artists are very good at exploiting			0
it 's still a bit of a cat and mouse game , but it 's much more complicated than it appears from the outside			0
" @entity3 is probably more the exception than the rule , although he 's an important exception , " she adds			1
in the meantime , the @entity40 face more danger from themselves than from @entity1 's @entity256 censors			1
@entity47 says only the other two members of the group continue to drink			0
he gave up alcohol almost 18 months ago following a drunken car crash in which he escaped almost miraculously unscathed			0
" i felt that @entity261 was sitting in the passenger seat on my right , " he recalls			0
" i just thought if i kept on drinking like this , he may not help me a second time			0

while @entity3 struggles with the censors , @entity1 's avant garde artists remain a force in the country
the @entity40 , *unlike* many @entity1 contemporary artists , live and work in their *hometown*
the group , who specialise in @entity1 calligraphy , say they do their best work when they are drunk
the group has a growing international *reputation* and their provocative works go under the radar in @entity1
