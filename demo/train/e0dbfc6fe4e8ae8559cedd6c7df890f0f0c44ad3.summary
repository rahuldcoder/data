-- @entity1 is expanding its gift feature to include plastic gift cards that carry balances for multiple stores and restaurants			1
the cards only work at four stores for now : @entity9 , @entity10 , @entity11 and the @entity12			1
so if you 've been wondering how to give your little sister a birthday gift that combines fruit smoothies , lip gloss and unlimited breadsticks , this product is for you			0
when you buy a card on the social network for a friend , they get a message informing them of the gift right away ( great for scrambling at the last minute )			1
the cash amount is loaded on to a plastic card that is delivered in the mail , likely in some sort of paper envelope			0
the recipient can then take that physical card into a physical store and buy physical goods			2
for an internet company , it 's all delightfully old fashioned			0
the cards will be rolling out gradually for @entity1 users in the @entity41			1
@entity1 is entering a crowded field and offers a couple of features to differentiate itself from other gift cards			1
the gift giver can choose which of the available stores to give money to -- say $ 5 to cover a drink at @entity10 and $ 20 for home goods at @entity9			1
the recipient can monitor the balances on their card from the @entity1 app ( but they ca n't move the money between vendors , no matter how much they would rather have mascara than pasta )			2
any gift amounts they get in the future are automatically added to the same card			0
@entity1 launched its gifts feature in september for physical goods like chocolate , shirts , flowers and wine , as well as virtual items like donations to charity , @entity73 credit and @entity75 subscriptions			0
it also offered gift cards for specific vendors such as @entity78 and @entity79			1
this new card is different because it will work at multiple retailers , is refillable and integrates with the @entity1 app. even though you can see your card 's balance on a smartphone , there are n't mobile payment options at the moment			2
@entity1 cards are n't compatible with existing mobile payment technology like @entity91 , qr codes or barcodes that allow people to pay for goods with their mobile phone			2
for now the company is sticking with the traditional plastic rectangle and magnetic - strip technology that is most widely accepted across the @entity41			0
the new product falls somewhere between store - specific cards and bank - issued open gift cards that can be used almost anywhere credit cards are accepted			1
it also may create some privacy issues			0
in order to receive the card , the recipient will have to share their mailing address with @entity1 , which might make some people uncomfortable			2
gift cards are an easy workaround for people who do n't have enough time or personal knowledge to pick out a specific gift			1
like cash , you know it will be useful and there 's no danger of getting people something they will hate			0
choosing cards from specific vendors like a favorite coffee spot or clothing store can be slightly more personal than a @entity131 card to be used anywhere			0
with this card you can mix and match stores			0
@entity1 has been experimenting with all kinds of money - making schemes in the past year , like paying to send messages to strangers			0
most of the company 's revenue comes from advertising -- 84 % , according to the latest earnings report -- but it also makes some money off games and programs like @entity148			0
the social network says it has more than a billion active users , and that 's a largely untapped resource			1
a @entity1 spokesperson said the company had nothing to share about how it will make money off the card service			1
there are no fees for the gift giver or gift receiver , so @entity1 is likely earning a percentage from the participating companies .			2

@entity1 is adding gift cards to its @entity165 service for users in the @entity41
*initial* offerings include @entity9 , @entity10 , @entity11 and the @entity12
when you buy a card on the social network for a friend , a message tells them of the gift
