-- @entity3 election officials will have access to a federal law enforcement database to challenge the eligibility of a person to vote as part of its effort to purge non-citizens from its voting rolls , state officials said			1
the @entity14 @entity13 will allow state officials access to the save -- systematic alien verification for entitlements -- database in an agreement that was announced saturday by @entity3 secretary of state @entity20 and the @entity21			1
the announcement follows weeks of legal wrangling between the federal and state officials , a fight being closely watched in @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity30 -- states that could ultimately swing november 's presidential election -- where officials are advocating for similar access			1
" @entity3 voters are counting on their state and federal governments to cooperate in a way that ensures elections are fair , beginning with ensuring the voter rolls are current and accurate , " @entity20 said in a statement			1
" now , we have a commitment to cooperate from @entity13 and we look forward to a partnership that improves our election process			0
" details of the agreement were not immediately available , and it was not clear when @entity3 would begin checking its voter rolls against the database , which lists those who are legally in the @entity14 on either visas or " green cards " but not eligible to vote			1
the @entity13 did not respond late saturday to a @entity0 request for comment			0
the @entity15 database , which contains alien registration numbers , is a web - based service that was created to help " federal , state and local benefit - issuing agencies , institutions , and licensing bureaus determine the immigration status of benefit applicants so only those entitled to benefits receive them , " according to @entity66			1
@entity3 officials sued last month to gain access to the database after an effort this year to purge the state voting rolls -- using driver licenses and birth dates -- went awry because of faulty state records			1
a @entity3 @entity76 spokesman , @entity75 , told @entity0 in june that the state identified roughly 100 people who are not citizens but registered to vote			2
@entity0 found , though , that some of the names on the potential purge list were , in fact , legitimate voters -- newly minted @entity14 recently granted citizenship			0
@entity13 and @entity3 struck a deal over the database just weeks after a federal judge rejected a @entity14 @entity89 lawsuit aimed at preventing @entity3 from moving forward with a voter registration purge			1
proponents of the plan say purging the rolls protects the integrity of the voting process , while critics say it targets the poor and minority voters who may be disenfranchised by the process			0
the poor , voting and civil rights groups say , can not afford to pay for documentation that may be required , while minorities would likely be among the groups whose voter registration records are examined			2
a number of states are moving to institute and tighten voter identification laws , and many are finding themselves in direct conflict with the federal government			2
a key provision of the landmark @entity113 grants the federal government open - ended oversight of states and localities -- many in the @entity119 -- with a history of voter discrimination			2
any changes in voting laws and procedures in those pre-determined areas must be " pre-cleared " by @entity126			0
today , 32 states have in place varying degrees of voter identification laws , according to the @entity131			0
some of the states with the most stringent requirements are also regions that have seen large increases in their minority population			0
@entity3 has the nation 's third largest @entity138 population , behind @entity140 and @entity141			0
@entity0 's @entity142 contributed to this report .			0
