-- i 'm a lover of books , great ones and not - so - great ones			1
and i also love lists			0
so it did n't surprise me when @entity7 recently came out with its 100 books to read in a @entity9			1
i was , however , more than a little shocked by the list , which crudely mixes categories , putting in a few classics , such as @entity15 's " 1984 " and @entity14 ' " @entity13 , " alongside " @entity16 " by @entity17 , " @entity18 " by @entity19 , and " @entity20 " by @entity21			1
really ? and do you think " @entity24 " by @entity25 should sit on the shelf of must - reads - before - dying with " @entity26 , " the great masterpiece by @entity28 ? in the novel category , should one read @entity31 's truly terrible " @entity30 " instead of , say , @entity33 's " @entity32 " or -- the greatest of all novels -- " @entity35 " by @entity36 ? for poetry , @entity7 recommends @entity38 's " @entity39 " instead of the poems of @entity41 or @entity42 or @entity43			1
for a great biography , we get @entity47 's admirable life of @entity48			0
but what about @entity52 's " @entity51 , " arguably the finest biography ever published ? certain books here are familiar to high school students , including " @entity56 , " " @entity57 , " and " @entity58			2
" i do n't myself like any of these much , if truth be told			0
one of my sons recently graduated from high school , and he complained that in the past six years he had been asked every single year to read " to kill a mockingbird			2
" surely there are other books about race relations in the @entity68 ? i also wonder about including so many recent popular novels , such as @entity71 's " @entity70 " or " @entity72 " by @entity73 or , even more puzzling , " @entity74 " by @entity75			2
these books made a splash , and continue to find readers , but any one of a dozen or more books could have been substituted for these , and the books in this category would certainly change with the decades			2
in the ' 20s , everyone thought you should read " @entity86 " by @entity85			0
in the ' 30s , you would have been asked to read " seven who fled " by @entity88			0
i liked certain choices here , however : @entity103 's " @entity102 " is certainly the best book about @entity91 ; more than that , it 's a dazzling work of art. @entity95 's " @entity94 " will always deserve readers , as will " @entity98 " by @entity99 and " @entity100 " by @entity101			0
but are these the 100 books you must read before you die or the 100 books @entity7 will probably sell you before you die ? the latter , i think			1
if you 're going to die soon , i suggest reading " @entity107 " by @entity108 , which did n't make @entity7 's list			1
it 's a sublime work of literature , a better memoir than any of the memoirs included here			0
and read " @entity119 " before you read " @entity115 " by @entity116 or " @entity117 " by @entity118			0
the latter are fine books , but they should not crowd out @entity108 or @entity122			1
it 's sad to see that @entity124 and @entity125 do n't make the @entity7 list			1
nor do @entity127 or @entity129 or @entity33			0
i 'd say that only about a third of the books on @entity7 's list are in any way essential reading			1
buy these books , if you must			0
and die , if you must			0
but if you want to know what books you should really read before you die , look elsewhere			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity141 .			2

@entity7 recently came out with its " 100 books to read in a @entity9 "
@entity141 : i was more than a little shocked by the list , which crudely mixes categories
if you 're going to die soon , he suggests reading " @entity107 " by @entity108
@entity141 : only about a third of the books on the @entity7 list are in any way must - reads
