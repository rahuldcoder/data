speaking to the influential @entity15 afterward , @entity1 said @entity5 research " continues to march forward " despite painful economic sanctions imposed on the @entity18 republic			2
" my friends , @entity2 has waited patiently waited for the international community to resolve this issue			0
we 've waited for diplomacy to work , " @entity1 said			0
" we 've waited for sanctions to work , " he said			0
" none of us can afford to wait much longer			0
as prime minister of @entity2 , i will never let my people live in the shadow of annihilation			1
" @entity33 : what is at stake as leaders meet ? before the two leaders met at the @entity9 , @entity0 told reporters that both he and @entity1 would prefer a diplomatic solution to the @entity5 issue			1
but @entity0 also repeated the warning that he delivered at @entity15 's annual conference in @entity42 on sunday -- that military force remains an option to prevent @entity5 from becoming a nuclear power			1
" the @entity49 will always have @entity2 's back when it comes to @entity2 's security , " @entity0 said , repeating a line from the sunday speech as @entity1 nodded in agreement			1
" i reserve all options and my policy here is not going to be one of containment ; my policy is prevention of @entity5 obtaining nuclear weapons and , as i indicated yesterday in my speech , when i say all options are on the table , i mean it , " @entity0 added			2
@entity1 said he welcomed @entity0 's " strong speech " on sunday and noted that @entity5 considers the @entity49 and @entity2 to be similar foes			1
" for them , you 're the great @entity69 , we 're the little @entity69 , " @entity1 said			0
" for them , we are you , and you are us			0
and you know something , mr. president ? at least on this last point , i think they 're right			0
we are you , and you are us			0
... @entity2 and @entity49 stand together			2
" @entity1 insisted that @entity2 will remain " the master of its fate " in ensuring that @entity5 not obtain a nuclear weapon			1
" @entity2 must reserve the right to defend itself , and after all , that 's the very purpose of the jewish state : to restore to the @entity81 people control over our destiny , " @entity1 said			1
@entity86 's blog : what does @entity2 really want ? @entity88 has insisted that its nuclear program is solely for peaceful purposes			0
@entity49 and @entity2 officials have said they suspect that @entity5 is trying to develop a nuclear weapon			1
both have said they will act to prevent that from occurring			0
earlier monday , the head of the @entity96 , director general @entity97 , reiterated agency statements that it can not say whether @entity5 's nuclear program is peaceful			0
@entity97 said the @entity96 " continues to have serious concerns regarding possible military dimensions			0
" monday 's @entity9 meeting lasted for two hours , with the leaders then taking part in a working lunch with their delegations , according to senior @entity49 administration officials who spoke on condition of not being identified			0
late monday , the @entity9 released a statement on the meeting , echoing many of the same themes touched on earlier in the day			0
@entity0 " reiterated the @entity49 ' commitment to pursuing a strategy of principled diplomacy , backed by unprecedented pressure , including the additional sanctions that are taking hold on the @entity5 regime , " the statement read			1
during the meeting , @entity1 was expected to press @entity0 for clarity on what would constitute the " red line " on nuclear arms that would cause the @entity49 to strike @entity5			1
however , the senior administration officials said @entity2 did not expect the @entity0 administration to shift from its stance that opposes @entity5 obtaining a nuclear weapon , compared with @entity2 's opposition to @entity5 gaining even the capability of developing a nuclear weapon			1
@entity0 , meanwhile , was considered likely to push @entity2 to refrain from any military action on its own in order to give diplomacy and expanded sanctions against @entity5 a full chance to resolve the issue			1
he will hold a news conference on tuesday			0
@entity0 is under criticism over his @entity5 policy from @entity143 opponents , including the leading @entity143 contenders to run against him in november 's @entity49 elections			1
@entity143 call for a stronger public stance against the possibility of @entity5 developing a nuclear weapon			0
accusing the @entity9 of embracing a policy of " appeasement " toward @entity5 , @entity143 presidential candidate @entity149 said the president has " turned his back on the state of @entity2			2
" he said @entity0 is " all talk and no action " on the matter of @entity5 and its putative nuclear aspirations			2
@entity149 made the comments in @entity160 , a suburb of @entity161 , during his final push through the state before tuesday 's @entity165 primary			0
speaking sunday to @entity15 , @entity0 warned that " all elements of @entity49 power " remain an option to prevent @entity5 from developing nuclear weapons , though the president also made clear that he prefers diplomacy over war			1
" too much loose talk of war with @entity5 " only benefits the @entity5 government by driving up the price of oil , @entity0 said to the @entity179 lobby group			2
@entity0 said his policy is not containment of a nuclear @entity5 but preventing @entity5 from obtaining a nuclear weapon			2
at the same time , he emphasized that @entity5 " should not doubt @entity2 's sovereign right to make its own decisions about what is required to meet its security needs			2
" while @entity0 's statements are consistent with his past pronouncements , his specific reference to preventing @entity5 from developing a nuclear weapon -- rather than the capability of building a nuclear weapon -- maintained what some consider to be a difference between his and @entity1 's position			1
@entity2 officials say that if @entity5 were to become able to enrich weapons - grade uranium , it would potentially cross the " red line " of nuclear weapons capability that @entity2 fears			0
in a statement issued sunday after @entity0 's speech , @entity1 expressed appreciation for the president 's position that all options are on the table to prevent @entity5 from developing a nuclear weapon			1
" i also appreciated the fact that he made clear that , when it comes to a nuclear - armed @entity5 , containment is simply not an option , " @entity1 said , " and equally , in my judgment , perhaps most important of all , i appreciated the fact that he said that @entity2 must be able to defend itself , by itself , against any threat			1

" none of us can afford to wait much longer , " @entity1 warns
@entity0 supports " principled diplomacy , backed by unprecedented pressure "
" i mean it , " the @entity49 president says of a possible military option
the prime minister says @entity2 has the right to defend itself against @entity5 threats
