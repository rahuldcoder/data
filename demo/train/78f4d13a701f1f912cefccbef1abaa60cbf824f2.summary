@entity0 -- the 500 - year - old panel is not much bigger than an average flatscreen tv and the wood has split , but what it shows is truly extraordinary			1
a painting of @entity7 that , after centuries of neglect , has been identified as @entity11 's " @entity10			1
" it 's a discovery so rare , so unlikely , that when @entity15 art dealer and @entity11 expert @entity14 of @entity17 first saw the painting , he did n't even consider the possibility			1
" the whole idea that it might be by him was almost an impossibility ; it 's kind of a dream , " said @entity14			2
the painting joins a small collection of surviving paintings by the @entity27 master who lived and worked in @entity28 in the 15th century , and is the star attraction in a major @entity11 exhibition opening in @entity0 in november , following careful conservation treatment to remedy the damage it suffered over the years			1
" @entity10 " ( @entity40 ) is known to have been owned by @entity35 king , @entity36 before moving around various private collections until 2005 , when the current owner brought it to @entity14 to study			1
" it was a very interesting painting but it 's not something i looked at and thought , ' @entity43 , it must be a @entity11 , ' " said @entity14			1
the true identity of the 66 x 45 centimeter oil - painted walnut panel had lain dormant for years , its distinguishing features hidden under layers of crude over-paint			0
it was known to have existed from preparatory drawings made by @entity11 and copies by his followers but experts assumed it had been destroyed			2
that 's why initially , @entity14 and @entity58 ( @entity57 and @entity59 for the @entity60 at the @entity61 of the @entity62 , @entity63 ) , thought the painting was by one of @entity11 's associates or pupils -- a fact which , in itself , would have made the work extremely precious and very valuable			1
besides , there are only some fifteen surviving @entity11 paintings in the world and the last one to be discovered was the " @entity74 " more than 100 years ago			2
so , what first alerted @entity14 and @entity58 to the possibility that the painting they were looking at could be the real thing ? " @entity36 and @entity58 did n't really allow ourselves to think in terms of attribution , " he said			2
" it 's one of the mistakes in any connoisseurship problem ( because ) it can pervert the intellectual process			0
" the truth revealed itself little - by - little as @entity58 painstakingly removed the layers of varnish and over-paint in her studio and @entity14 carefully studied the painting 's provenance , comparing it with @entity11 's other paintings and preparatory drawings			1
but there were two important clues			0
one was a so - called " pentimento , " an alteration in the painting showing traces of previous work that @entity14 discovered by scrutinizing a photo of the painting taken using night vision , and using other techniques			0
the other was the painting of @entity7 's curls			1
" i was looking at the curls and @entity112 at the @entity113 , who has this huge head of massive ringlets and they are exactly the same , " said @entity58			0
as to the " pentimento , " she said , " @entity14 always suspected that it was there			0
" she describes him using infrared reflectograms to see under the layers of paint , and discovering the thumb in the blessing hand and the stole @entity7 is wearing painted in different positions			0
the way the artist had worked out how to position the various elements in the painting suggested @entity11 's way of working			1
" when we started adding many things into the equation it started to seem ( more likely ) , we were sort of saying to each other , ' it has to be ( a @entity11 ) , ' " she said			2
but , says @entity58 , she continued to have doubts : " i just could n't believe it -- this is the rarest thing imaginable			0
how could this be ? " she remembers thinking : " have i lost my mind completely , have we both lost our minds ? " but as their scholarship deepened , they were able to narrow down their suspicions until they were sure they were dealing with a real @entity11			1
it was at this point that the safety of the painting became a priority			0
" i had to finish what i was doing very quickly because once it was ( revealed to be ) a @entity11 , it could n't stay here ( in the studio ) , it was n't insured to stay here , " @entity58 said			2
so , they sent it to @entity15 's @entity162 for safekeeping			0
@entity14 and @entity58 then called in @entity11 experts from all over the world to further verify the painting			1
for @entity14 , the nearly seven - year process has been the pinnacle of an already distinguished career			0
" this is not a little ripple in a pond , this is like a boulder , " he said			0
" i 'll be pushing on but i have no expectations of making ( another ) discovery of this level			0
this is the art history equivalent of a gold medal , " he continued			0
" @entity10 " is going on public display in @entity0 in november , as part of the exhibition @entity11 : @entity182 of @entity183 at the @entity184 .			1

neglected for centuries , a @entity11 painting is *rediscovered*
@entity190 so unlikely art historian and conservator thought they had " lost their minds "
main clues were original alterations in *composition* and painting of the curls
" @entity10 " now being exhibited for first time in @entity0 's @entity184
