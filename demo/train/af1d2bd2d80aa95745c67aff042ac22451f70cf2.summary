have identified a new disease among people in @entity5 that causes @entity8 - like symptoms but is not associated with @entity9			1
the study , released in the @entity11 thursday , found patients with the disease were making antibodies that attacked their immune systems			1
" we all make molecules and proteins in the body that tell our immune system how to function properly , " said dr. @entity16 , a clinical investigator at the @entity17 at @entity2 and the lead author on the study			1
" they tell different immune cells when to turn on and when to start fighting infection , " she said			2
" we found a large number of the patients that we studied with serious opportunistic infections make an antibody that blocks the function of one of these molecules , which is interferon - gamma			2
" without functioning interferon - gamma , people become more susceptible to certain types of infections -- infections people with working immune systems normally do n't get , she said			1
the disease is being called an adult - onset immunodeficiency syndrome because it strikes adults			2
cases date back to 2004 , with most of them occurring in @entity46 and @entity47			1
the @entity2 has been studying the disease since 2005			1
" it 's rare -- more prevalent over in @entity5 , " @entity16 told @entity0			0
" but we have been diagnosing it here in the @entity53 in individuals of @entity56 descent			1
" so far @entity2 has seen about 12 cases , all of them in people of @entity56 descent			1
according to @entity16 , most patients survive			2
there have been deaths in other countries , she said , but did not know how many			0
no one has died in the @entity53			0
dr. @entity65 , director of @entity17 , says it 's important to note the disease is not contagious			1
" it is not a virus , that 's the first thing			0
it 's not a new @entity8 - like virus , " @entity65 said			0
" it 's a syndrome that was noticed and discovered in @entity5 where people get opportunistic infections similar to hiv / aids , but the cause of the syndrome is not an infection like @entity9			0
" @entity65 said researchers " found the people have an autoimmunity , where their bodies are making antibodies against a protein that 's important in fighting infection			1
" the reason the body is making that antibody is unclear but it is n't a virus like @entity9 that 's causing it , " he said			0
" it 's autoimmune disease , and people get secondary infections similar to @entity8			2
" the study was already in the early stages in 2009 , when @entity98 , a 62 - year - old @entity99 woman from @entity100 , came to @entity2 suffering from symptoms that would be linked to the mystery disease			1
a little more than 200 people -- almost exclusively from @entity46 and @entity47 between the ages of 18 and 78 -- were studied			1
all were @entity9 - negative			0
" we want to understand what triggers people to make these antibodies in the first place , " @entity16 said			2
" and we want to use that information to guide treatment -- because really , when you treat the infection you 're treating the symptom			0
you 're not treating the underlying cause			0
" right now , doctors are simply treating the infections			0
for many of the patients , that 's sufficient , @entity16 said , but for those cases where it 's not , they are trying to find ways to target the antibodies themselves by lowering the antibody levels and trying to reverse the immunodeficiency			1
both @entity65 and @entity16 believe a combination of both genetic and environmental factors are most likely at play , but do n't yet know what those factors are			0
" overall it appears to be a chronic disease , but we have not yet studied it for a long enough period of time to know the long - term prognosis , " @entity16 said			0
" we do n't yet know what factors may distinguish those with mild versus those with severe disease			0

patients with disease are making antibodies that attack their immune system
cases date back to 2004 , with most of them occurring in @entity46 and @entity47
*scientists* do not believe the disease is contagious
the @entity2 has seen about 12 cases , all in people of @entity56 descent
