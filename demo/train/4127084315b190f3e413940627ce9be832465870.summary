after 208 episodes , countless " legendarys ! " and any number of pineapple incidents , slaps and slutty pumpkins , " @entity7 " came to an end monday night			1
throughout the final season , the show hinted at who the mother is			1
still , the nine - year - long story that future @entity13 had been telling his kids ended with plenty of surprises			1
now that we 've said goodbye to @entity13 and his friends and the hit sitcom that often challenged the conventions ( like , say , telling stories in chronological order ) , let 's turn to the cast and the creators as they look back			1
kids , here 's how they 'll remember " @entity7			1
" how they knew the show would last @entity30 ( co-creator ) : when we first started making the show , we had this weird , na√Øve idea that it would run a long time			1
it was our first show and we did n't really know about how often shows get canceled , but there was always this special feeling about the show , that it would really last a while			1
@entity40 ( co-creator ) : the cast were like , " this is too fun , this is doomed to fail , we ca n't be allowed to do this for nine years			1
" and we were just stupidly optimistic			1
it could have failed a few times , but thank @entity45 it did n't			1
@entity47 ( director ) : the pilot was so special , getting to discover who these characters were to become			1
whether it 's a two - minute date or a song - and - dance number , everything has made me better			1
if you asked me before if i could do any of those things , i 'd probably say no. @entity57 ( @entity13 ) : i remember feeling that first episode with @entity59 , i remember @entity60 called us into watch that			1
i remember thinking , " this is a really special show			1
" it does things differently than other shows			2
it uses so many different styles			2
we half - intentionally created something new and we hope it will stick around			2
how much impact guest stars had bays : having @entity74 here was pretty memorable			2
we were such a garage band show , we were doing ok in the ratings but were n't really on anyone 's radar , then suddenly this international superstar parachutes into the set and it was a very bizarre week			1
@entity82 ( @entity83 ) : @entity84 was adorable			2
she called my little girl a coconut			2
how they made their favorite episodes @entity90 ( @entity91 ) : @entity91 had a big musical number about suits on the @entity95 lot , like an old @entity97 musical , i even swung around a lamppost			2
i loved that episode , plus i got to sing and dance			2
@entity101 ( @entity102 ) : i loved our " @entity103 " with @entity57 and @entity105			2
i love anything that involves music			2
@entity108 and @entity40 are so musical			2
they were in a band together and i was really happy that they brought their musical talent to our show			1
@entity82 : there was one scene where i was pregnant with my first baby			0
@entity118 was meeting me at the airport and had this marching band play for me and greet me at the airport			0
@entity57 : i love when you get to see what 's in @entity13 's heart			0
when he 's just really present with someone			0
i did some great stuff with @entity101 this year			0
i 've had a nice parade of co-stars , co-girlfriends for @entity13			0
everyone brings out something different from me			0
how they feel about the show 's catchphrases @entity82 : i really like " you son of a bitch " ... " youuuu son of a beetch			1
" @entity90 : i like the way @entity91 uses " legendary , " because it 's a very loaded word			0
no one should ever use the word " legendary , " because if you 're talking in the present tense , you sound kind of pompous			0
unless you 're @entity91 , because he thinks every single thing he does is massive			0
" this interview right now is legendary			0
this will be in the @entity148 ! " how they spent nine years @entity150 ( @entity151 ) : watching my co-stars have their children was special			0
i did n't literally watch the act of giving birth , but it 's been special watching them grow up			0
@entity158 : a lot of these people have been here for the whole nine years			0
we have a family dynamic on our set and i will miss that			1
@entity82 : i went through both of my pregnancies on the show			1
@entity90 : i 'm gon na miss " it 's wednesday , we 've got ta go to work			1
" now it 's wednesday , i 've got ta get a job			0
@entity40 : we 've worked so hard for nine years , we do n't have any friends			0
these nine characters are our friends			0
thank @entity45 we have each other			0
how they said goodbye @entity158 : we had our last table read and i cried puddles of tears			0
it 's such a good group of people , such a great show			1
i get to play such a wonderful character			0
i 'm so blessed and i 'm sad to say goodbye , but we 've been blessed to be on the air for nine years which does n't happen anymore			0
@entity40 : we 're five seconds from crying at any given moment			0
@entity150 : i do n't want to go out on a limb , but i will			0
this is potentially the best finale of any show ever ... with the possible exception of the second " @entity193 " series .			1
