@entity1 troops surround the @entity11 embassy in the capital , @entity0 , on tuesday			1
@entity8 , a centrist whose politics took a strong turn to the left once in office , was ousted in a coup on june 28			2
despite increasing political , diplomatic and economic isolation , the government of interim president @entity19 has steadfastly resisted pressure to allow @entity8 to return to power			2
@entity19 maintains that @entity8 's removal was not a coup but a constitutional transfer of power , and @entity19 thwarted two very public attempts by @entity8 to return to his homeland			1
when @entity8 suddenly appeared inside the @entity11 embassy in the capital of @entity0 on monday , it caught everyone by surprise , even the @entity11 , @entity11 foreign minister @entity28 told @entity2 en @entity34			1
in response , @entity19 's government ordered a curfew beginning monday evening			0
many @entity39 supporters ignored the call and demonstrated outside of the @entity11 embassy			2
police dispersed about 2,500 demonstrators without causing any deaths , @entity19 said in a televised statement tuesday			0
but a doctor said that at least 80 people were admitted to an area hospital with injuries , @entity46 , a @entity1 journalist for the newspaper @entity47 , told @entity2			0
most were released from the hospital tuesday afternoon , @entity46 said			0
after the curfew was announced monday , the government extended it once until tuesday evening and then again to 6 a.m. wednesday			0
the result was a nearly - deserted city blanketed by what @entity46 called a " tense calm			0
" uncertainty was fueling the tension in @entity1 , @entity46 said -- uncertainty about what @entity8 , who said he returned for " homeland , restitution or death , " has planned , and how @entity19 , who has held his ground against international pressure , will respond			1
" the country is paralyzed , " @entity46 said			0
supermarkets , banks , gas stations and public transpiration were all closed because of the curfew			0
schools and universities also closed			0
police and soldiers maintained a security cordon around the @entity11 embassy , dispersing supporters of @entity8 -- who remained holed up inside the embassy			1
all flights in and out of the country were canceled tuesday , after all four of @entity1 ' international airports were also closed			1
@entity19 's government isolated the @entity11 embassy by cutting water , power and phone lines to the building , @entity88 @entity87 spokesman @entity86 confirmed to reporters in @entity96			1
@entity28 , the @entity11 foreign minister , said the action was a " very serious " move by @entity19 that violated international law			0
but police claimed utilities were turned off in the area surrounding the embassy to discourage looting			0
about 100 people remained inside the embassy tuesday night , many of them supporters and friends of @entity8 , @entity28 said			2
the @entity11 foreign minister said he spoke with @entity8 and asked him not to use inflammatory language			1
likewise , @entity86 said , " the @entity88 calls on all parties to remain calm and avoid actions that might provoke violence in @entity1 and place individuals at risk or harm			2
we urge that all parties refrain from actions that would lead to further unrest			0
" @entity86 said the @entity88 embassy in @entity0 had closed because of the situation , but that @entity88 diplomats remained in contact with both sides in the conflict			1
@entity129 delivered to the @entity11 embassy tuesday was believed to have been brought by the @entity88 , @entity46 said			1
the @entity88 and @entity11 said they support dialogue between the two sides , centered on the @entity134 , an agreement negotiated by @entity137 president @entity136			2
but in an interview with local network @entity139 , @entity19 said that @entity8 's sudden appearance would not revive negotiations			1
@entity19 's government sent a letter to the @entity11 authorities on tuesday asking them either to give @entity8 asylum in their country or to turn him over to @entity1 authorities			1
@entity8 faces charges of violating the constitution relating to a proposed referendum that was at the center of his ouster			0
" unless the government of @entity11 proposes another solution , its obligation is to turn him over to the relevant @entity1 authorities with urgency , " the letter said			2
earlier in the day , local television footage showed video of water cannons being used to scatter @entity8 supporters and the ousted president 's backers throwing rocks and other objects at police			1
the demonstrators flipped over and burned a police vehicle , said @entity172 newspaper , which showed a photograph of an overturned truck on its web page			0
@entity8 was removed by soldiers in a coup june 28 after he tried to hold an election that day on a measure to allow a president to run for a second consecutive term			0
the measure would have asked @entity1 whether they wanted to place a referendum on the november presidential ballot , which would convene a constitutional assembly to consider changing presidential term limits			0
@entity8 's term ends in january and he would not have been subject to any measures adopted by the constitutional assembly			1
the nation 's supreme court ruled the june ballot initiative was illegal and congress had decreed @entity8 could n't hold it			2
@entity19 has denied that a coup took place , saying that @entity8 was removed legally through constitutional means			0
he vowed monday night to stay in power despite @entity8 's return			1
it was not publicly known tuesday how @entity8 got into the country and he declined to provide details , only telling @entity2 that it was a 15 - to 16 - hour trip he took " with the help of @entity1			1
