@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 cabin crew members went on strike saturday , leaving thousands of would - be passengers ' travel plans during the next two weeks in disarray			1
the strike came after @entity4 chief executive @entity10 and the joint general secretary of the @entity13 union , @entity14 , emerged friday from a meeting and announced the effort to avert the walkout had failed			1
" this company does not want to negotiate , " @entity14 said of @entity4			2
" this company wants ultimately to go to war with my members and the union			0
" @entity22 said he " deeply regrets " the inconvenience the strikes will cause to passengers but said the company will still try to operate as many flights as possible			2
" i am disappointed the union has not been able to see the sense of the proposal we tabled today , " @entity22 said			0
advice for passengers @entity4 posted lists on its web site of flights that it plans to operate during the walkout			1
a spokesperson for prime minister @entity38 said he " believes that this strike is in no one 's interest and will cause unacceptable inconvenience to passengers			0
he urges the strike be called off immediately " and the two sides return to bargaining			0
in addition to the three - day strike beginning saturday , @entity13 has decided to strike for four more days beginning march 27			1
@entity13 represents 95 percent of @entity4 's 15,000 cabin crew members , but not all of them plan to strike			1
the airline has unveiled an ambitious contingency plan to get as many passengers as possible to their destinations			1
@entity22 said he hopes that by leasing aircraft and using replacement workers , @entity4 will be able to deliver about two - thirds of its customers to their planned destinations during the strikes			1
in a full - page ad in @entity64 newspapers friday , @entity22 said a " significant number " of cabin crews do n't support the strike and will continue to work , supported by volunteers from across the airline			0
the airline said it has also made agreements with more than 60 other carriers to rebook customers free of charge if their @entity4 flights are canceled during the strike period			1
will a strike by @entity4 affect you ? but in a posting on its web site , @entity13 called the schedule " an accomplished work of fantasy			1
" the industrial action is over planned changes to the way cabin crews operate , which @entity4 says will save the carrier more than 60 million pounds ( $ 90 million ) a year			2
@entity13 has said the plans call for working hours to be extended and crew staffing levels to be cut , changes that it has said will damage customer service and the @entity4 brand			1
" @entity13 believes the new contractual changes are an attempt to force staff to pay the price for management failings with the company wringing more and more out of fewer and fewer staff who will be paid less , " the union said in a posting on its web site			1
a cabin crew member 's starting salary is 11,000 pounds ( $ 16,500 ) , @entity13 said			0
@entity13 said that @entity4 management submitted a formal offer to the union last week , but the offer failed to address union concerns about crew numbers and service delivery			1
that prompted @entity13 officials to announce the strike dates			2
@entity4 then rescinded its offer			0
@entity4 submitted a new offer friday , but @entity14 said it reduced the amount of pay that had been in last week 's offer			0
@entity119 : are you caught up in the strike ? a sticking point in negotiations was reportedly how @entity4 could be compensated for the 27 million pound ( $ 40.5 million ) loss it had already incurred through canceled tickets before the talks broke down			2
@entity22 said he told @entity13 that the expense must be recovered , so the financial value of friday 's offer was " not as attractive " as last week 's			0
the new offer , however , would have secured long - term pay protection for all existing crew , " new opportunities " for @entity4 crew at @entity0 's @entity137 , and modernization of its industrial relations , he said			2
any @entity4 workers who go on strike now risk losing permanently their travel perks , such as free and heavily discounted travel			2
" we said to them that we will not continue to provide valuable perks and benefits to people who seek to inflict serious and ongoing damage to our business , " @entity22 said			0
" it was n't a threat			0
when we said that those traveling concessions will be withdrawn , that 's exactly what we meant , and that 's exactly what will happen			0
" should @entity4 staff lose travel perks ? @entity13 said @entity4 cabin crews offered changes to pay and work practices that would have saved the company more than 100 million pounds ( $ 150 million ) , but that their offer was rejected			1
the airline 's management said the proposed changes would have saved the airline less money than management 's planned changes			0
