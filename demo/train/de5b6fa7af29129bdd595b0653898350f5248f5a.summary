-- if the excessive lifestyles of the rich have been partly to blame for destroying the environment , then it seems equitable that they use their money to preserve it			1
but the degree to which they are actually helping does largely depend on what they do with their money			2
and some ' beneficiaries ' of that aid are yet to be convinced			2
@entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14 at the @entity15 last september			2
according to last year 's @entity18 survey of the world 's wealth , there are 9.5 million @entity22 dollar millionaires in the world today , who have pocketed a cool $ 37.2 trillion between them			1
by 2011 , @entity18 says , this tiny ( but growing ) group of people will have more than $ 50 trillion in their bank accounts			1
that money could go a long way to aid the fight against climate change and the different ills it brings			2
fortunately , a modest proportion of this exclusive group of people have realized this			2
around 11 percent of the world 's richest gave 7 percent of their wealth to philanthropic causes in 2006 ; and 17 percent of the world 's " ultra rich " ( those with more than $ 30 million to their names ) gave 10 percent , says @entity18			1
in total those donations totaled $ 285 billion			1
some of the more notable donors are household names : @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity12 all dug deep into their pockets in the name of doing good , the latter specifically promising $ 3 billion to fight global warming over the next 10 years			1
@entity56 , @entity57 and @entity58 have also contributed , notably buying land in @entity60 in the name of conservation			2
@entity56 , the founder of @entity0 , owns more than 100,000 acres of land there ; @entity64 owns 2 million acres ; @entity57 1 million			2
if you accept the fact that much of the world 's environmental ills have landed on the shoulders of the world 's poorest nations , then this looks like a match made in heaven			1
" it is pretty hard for a country to turn down a gift of 300,000 hectares , " @entity75 , founder of clothing chain @entity76 , told one reporter recently			2
@entity75 and his wife , @entity81 , former ceo of @entity83 clothing company , specialize in investing in national parks in @entity60 and own around 900,000 hectares of @entity86 and @entity87 land between them			2
with the amount of money and influence these individuals possess , one key advantage they have is that they can get things done -- and quickly			0
@entity97 philanthropist @entity96 , for example , brought @entity99 's @entity98 to life in " barely two years " by investing millions of dollars of his own money in it , completing a job " that would likely have taken more than a decade without his backing " reports the age			1
@entity108 can spur backlash but not everyone welcomes the foreign assistance			1
the implication that foreigners can do a better job than those in the host country receiving the aid has been taken as an insult by some			1
and it has aroused suspicion elsewhere			0
in the 1990s @entity75 drew ire in @entity86 , including the @entity121 and former president @entity122			0
the accusations against him ranged from from kicking workers off his land , promoting abortion , and creating a " @entity129 enclave , " according to the @entity130			0
when it comes to rain forests there is also a degree of concern among some environmental groups that any system that allows individuals to take ownership of vast swathes of environmentally crucial land is bound to be flawed			0
in the case of the @entity145 rain forest , @entity142 has expressed concerns over the future of the rain forest inhabitants , the indigenous people			0
the organization points out that if the world really wanted to protect the rain forests , it would just leave them alone and let the people who have been protecting them for centuries carry on doing what they do best			1
" the forest can not be bought , it is our life ; we have always protected it , " tribal leader @entity158 told the @entity160 newspaper recently			0
pragmatists would argue there are many ways to " protect " a rain forest			0
yes , leaving them alone is the ideal solution			0
but when cash - strapped governments face ongoing pressure from logging companies , mining companies , not to mention the agricultural lobby to convert the land for other uses , there is only one thing that really counts : @entity181			0
and indigenous groups do n't have any			0
so , the argument goes , better a philanthropist own the land than a business interest			0
the business of giving a philanthropist deciding to do charitable work does not by itself guarantee successful results			0
much can depend on the philanthropist doing the " right thing " with their money			0
@entity57 , for example , could be seen as either an environmental savior or an eco-villain , depending on one 's view of biofuels			1
the philanthropist manages more than 170,000 hectares of @entity87 land , but his latest venture -- worth reportedly up to $ 300 million -- is to produce biofuel from corn and sugar cane grown in @entity210 's @entity209			1
that area of land is among the most endangered on @entity213 , with deforestation rates easily eclipsing that of the @entity145 , according to @entity216			1
more than 50 percent of the @entity209 has been converted to farm land in less than four decades and there are genuine fears that by 2030 , all remaining natural vegetation will have disappeared , reports the @entity221			1
there will be one predominant reason for this if that happens : worldwide demand for ethanol			0
it should not be forgotten that the art of giving is a business , too			0
some of the favored destinations for philanthropic spending have been in areas of the world offering the potential for the biggest returns			1
it was the collapse of the peso which led to a collapse in land prices in @entity87 that helped remote @entity83 become such a favored investment destination for the world 's wealthiest			1
equally , if the price is n't right , environmental concern can go out the window			0
@entity246 has been trying to lease 830,000 hectares of its rain forest since 2001 in an attempt to raise capital and do the right thing at the same time			0
it could easily lease it to logging companies , but prefers not to , according to @entity253			0
the problem is , @entity246 ca n't find a buyer , as no one has been willing to pay the asking rate of $ 2 a hectare , which would work out at a mere $ 1.6 million a year			2
" the fine words of the rich - world 's armchair conservationists butter few parsnips in the poor world , " writes @entity253			1
" here is a good opportunity to spread some butter			0

an **estimated** 9.5 millionaires in world are worth $ 37.2 trillion , @entity18 reports
@entity213 's elite rich gave an **estimated** $ 285 billion to charity in 2006
