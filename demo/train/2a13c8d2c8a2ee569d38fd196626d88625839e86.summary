-- most console video games these days imitate box - office blockbusters with life - like , amazing special effects , dramatic dialog and powerful storytelling			0
with its blocky cartoonishness , the @entity7 franchise flips that convention on its head			1
developed by the company @entity11 , the latest in the @entity7 series , " @entity13 , " puts @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 and the rest of the characters from " @entity19 " trilogy into block toy form as they trace storylines from the popular books and movies			1
this is n't the first time @entity11 has taken aim at a popular movie icon and transformed it into @entity7			1
@entity31 , " @entity33 " and @entity32 characters have been made into toy - like video games with some success			2
with the popular @entity19 franchise , however , the stakes are higher , and the company rose to the occasion by staying true to the story as it was presented on the big screen			2
in " @entity13 , " the characters ' voices are the same as those heard in the movies ; the dialog , too , is unchanged			1
@entity49 , executive producer for @entity11 , said that true - to - movie setup created some challenges			2
it was unclear , for instance , if dramatic dialog would translate into lighter , @entity7 humor			1
fortunately , he said , it worked out well			0
" we actually gained quite a lot of humor and , in addition , we can also convey the complexities of the characters a lot more easily than we thought , " @entity49 said			0
he added : " it 's what @entity7 brings to the party			1
that lightness of touch , that familiarity , that humor brings those darker moments up to a level that seems age appropriate			1
" here 's an example : in one @entity19 movie , @entity14 and @entity74 look upon @entity76 for the first time			0
@entity14 says , " @entity74 , i 'm glad you 're with me			0
" the @entity7 version uses the same scene and the same lines			1
but , as @entity14 delivers his line in the game , he also loads @entity74 up with gear supplies			0
" the inclusion of the dialog allows us to retain the cinematic quality , although it is @entity7 - recreated , " @entity49 said			2
" it allows us to tell the story a lot better			0
but we still have bags of humor that plays with that irreverence that you 'd suspect from a @entity7 game			1
" the appeal of these two popular franchises combined in a video game is expected to hit a wide audience from older fans who read the @entity104 series in the 1960s and 70s as teens to the younger generation who can quote lines from the movie from memory and who are the target audience for the @entity7 toys			1
the balance between the two audiences is tricky			0
" for our youngest gamer , say a 7 - year - old lad , we need to ensure they can play this story , have fun and be rewarded and still feel like it is an epic adventure , " @entity49 said			0
" but playing through all the game , through the free play sections , collecting the 40 new magical items and finding and discovering new characters -- those kinds of things go for the old gamers			2
" the game does include some dark moments			0
@entity49 said the company does n't shy away from characters getting killed , but they do it @entity7 style			1
" @entity13 " was released for @entity134 , @entity135 , pc and @entity137 on november 13 in @entity138			2
it will be released in @entity139 on friday			0
