-- there are seemingly millions of smartphone apps out there designed to make traveling easier , but not all of them are very good			1
every company seems to think that it needs an app to be cool , but not every app is worth the effort			1
here are some of the apps that i find to be most helpful while on the road : @entity14 i 'm one of those guys who always thinks that more information is better , and that 's why i like @entity14			2
you can see exactly where your flight ( or any other flight ) is at the moment			0
i 've used the @entity14 website for years to see near real - time flight tracking , and now there 's an app as well			1
were you told your airplane is coming from @entity27 , but it 's still not there and you should be boarding ? go to @entity14 to see where the airplane is right now			0
@entity14 is hardly the only one in this space			0
other frequent fliers swear by @entity31 , for example			1
@entity33 when i was in @entity35 recently , my wife was looking for something before our next flight			0
trying to find the right store in an airport the size of @entity42 is a mind - numbing experience			2
@entity45 , however , gives the rundown on which stores and restaurants are in each terminal and it pulls in reviews as well			0
if you 're in an airport looking for a particular product or service , this will make your task much easier			0
hotel tonight have you ever been somewhere and realized you needed a room for the night ? maybe your flight was canceled or perhaps your meetings ran long			0
this company negotiates deals with hotels for last - minute rooms in many big cities			1
within seconds , you can have the room reserved for a low rate			0
@entity69 if you do n't know a city well , the taxi scene can be confusing			1
where is the best place to hail a cab ? how much should you pay ? @entity69 makes it a lot easier			1
if there 's a participating cab company in your city , @entity69 will have a cab sent right to you			1
you can pay directly through the app so you do n't have to worry about whether credit is accepted or not			1
the app and booking services are free , and there 's a $ 1.50 documentation fee for using a credit card through the app. if there is n't a participating cab company in the area , @entity69 will give you phone numbers for local companies so you can call and arrange for a cab yourself			1
@entity96 if you 've ever used @entity96 online to manage your travel , you know it 's a great tool for keeping all your travel plans in one place			0
of course , there 's also an app for that			2
see and manage all your travel plans in the @entity96 app so you never lose your details			2
beyond the basics of flights , hotels and cars , you can also put in things like appointments and meals			0
your airline app this is n't one app ; it 's dependent upon which airline you fly			1
if you fly a different airline every time , then it 's probably not worth downloading every single airline app. but if you 're a loyalist , you should absolutely have it			2
there are some excellent apps out there that allow you to check flight status , see the standby list , book flights and even check in			2
apps will store a mobile boarding pass so you can just flash your phone to get on the airplane ( not in all airports , but it 's getting there )			0
some airlines have better apps than others			0
i 've heard rave reviews about the new @entity143 app , but get the apps for the airlines you fly frequently			1
what would you add to the list ?			0

@entity150 connects travelers with last - minute rooms at *discounted* rates
