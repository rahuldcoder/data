@entity0 -- @entity3 , acting director of the @entity4 , is expected to resign under pressure , perhaps in the next day or two , in the wake of the controversy over @entity8 , two senior federal law enforcement sources said monday			1
in the operation , straw buyers were allowed to purchase illegally large numbers of weapons , some of which ended up in the hands of cartels in @entity17			1
attorney general @entity18 will meet tuesday with @entity19 , head of the @entity21 field office in @entity22 , about possibly becoming the agency 's acting director , according to senior federal law enforcement sources , who are familiar with the details of the controversy			1
@entity30 press secretary @entity29 told reporters he had no new information on the issue			0
the operation has come under intense criticism since the december killing of a @entity38 @entity37 officer			0
@entity8 was " a colossal failure of leadership , " @entity39 , a supervisor at the bureau 's @entity41 field office , said recently			1
the program focused on following people who legally bought weapons that were then transferred to criminals and destined for @entity17			2
but instead of intercepting the weapons when they switched hands , @entity8 called for @entity21 agents to let the guns " walk " and wait for them to surface in @entity17 , according to a report by the @entity54			1
the idea was that once the weapons in @entity17 were traced back to the straw purchasers , the entire arms smuggling network could be brought down			2
instead , the report argues , letting the weapons slip into the wrong hands was a deadly miscalculation that resulted in preventable deaths , including that of @entity37 agent @entity8			0
@entity8 was killed last year north of the @entity17 border in @entity66 after confronting bandits believed to be preying on illegal immigrants			2
two weapons found near the scene of the killing were traced to @entity8			0
i could n't believe it at first , " @entity8 's mother , @entity73 , said when she learned the @entity21 may have let some of the guns used in the attack slip through its fingers			0
@entity8 's relatives said they want all those involved in his killing and who helped put the weapons in their hands to be prosecuted			0
" we ask that if a government official made a wrong decision , that they admit their error and take responsibility for his or her actions , " @entity84 , @entity8 's cousin and family spokesman , said in a hearing last week by the @entity30 panel			0
the committee 's chairman , rep. @entity96 , @entity98 , called the operation " felony stupid			0
" as many as 2,000 semiautomatic rifles reached the hands of cartels as a result , and @entity96 said the top two @entity21 officials were briefed on the program regularly			1
in @entity17 , the case has drawn nationwide attention and sharp criticism from top officials , who have long stressed that @entity38 weapons are fueling the country 's drug war			2
the @entity17 attorney general 's office demanded a quick @entity38 investigation of the matter in march and said authorities must hold accountable anyone who was responsible for the operation			1
" as the @entity38 government has signaled , the government of @entity17 was not informed of any operation that would include the controlled transport of weapons to @entity17 , " the office said .			1
