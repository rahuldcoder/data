-- an @entity2 computer worm was launched on wednesday but so far has not caused problems for the millions of computers that are believed to be infected			1
this piece of computer code tells the worm to activate on april 1 , researchers found			2
" i think joke 's on us a little bit , which you would have expected with having an april 1 date , " said @entity9 , threat response manager for @entity12 's @entity11 , a computer security service			0
however , that does n't mean the much - talked - about worm , called @entity22 , is a joke , computer security experts told @entity0 on wednesday			1
" by no means do i think we 're in the clear , " said @entity24 , a forensics and security analyst for @entity26 , based in @entity27 , @entity28			0
on wednesday , a master computer gained control of an estimated 5 million " zombie " pcs infected with the worm , experts said			1
security experts fear the author of the malicious computer program essentially could do anything with those @entity42 - based machines			2
no attempts by the author to upload anything had been noted as of 8 p.m. et wednesday , according to @entity46 , program director at nonprofit research institute @entity47			0
@entity49 's motive is probably financial , security experts said			1
the worm 's author could steal financial information , shut down web pages , track keystrokes or send spam from infected computers			1
" they have full administrative - level rights to run anything they want on all of the infected machines , " said @entity58 , chief research officer for @entity59 , an internet security company			2
experts who spoke to @entity0 on wednesday said it 's unlikely the program 's author will launch any sort of attack wednesday or thursday			2
but they said some sort of issue is likely to arise in coming weeks or months			0
ireport.com : what do you think of the @entity2 worm ? experts urged computer users not to panic			1
the easiest way for computer users to see if they 're infected is to try to access @entity42 updates from @entity82			2
if you can reach the site and if your system updates are working , it is unlikely your computer is infected , experts said			1
further computer patches and information can be found at the @entity93 's web site			0
the worm does not affect @entity96 computers			1
a core group of about 40 computer analysts , researchers and policy experts is working to dismantle the worm , said @entity102 , manager of security research at @entity105 , and a member of the group , which some call the @entity109			1
@entity102 said the group 's unprecedented efforts may be one reason an attack has n't happened			0
he said the april 1 launch date for the virus may have been a ploy by the program 's author to get attention from the news media			0
or it could be a twisted joke			0
" either way , it suggests an interesting sense of humor , i guess , " he said			0
the worm allows a master computer to communicate with the infected machines through web sites the worm generates			1
that function became active april 1 , experts said , and allows @entity49 's author or authors to seize control of millions of computers around the world			1
infected machines are generating 50,000 urls per day , which allows the master to talk with them			2
a previous version of @entity49 created only 250 domain names per day			1
" what happened now , today , is that the machines started pulling 50,000 domain names in 116 countries around the world -- so that 's the change , " said @entity58 , another member of the @entity109			1
" the @entity49 gang realized we could shut down 250 domain names a day , so they upped the ante , " he said			1
computer experts will continue to try to shut down the @entity155 addresses that let @entity49 's author communicate with infected machines , he said			1
members of the @entity93 have contacted security officials in all 116 affected countries and have shut down many active domain names , @entity58 said			1
@entity162 , of @entity12 , said the sophistication of the worm is unprecedented			2
the situation has played out in the news media as an @entity2 joke			1
on a technology blog , the @entity168 mocked the hype about @entity49			1
" @entity172 woke up to find the iconic clock tower @entity174 stopped at precisely one minute till midnight , " @entity171 wrote			0
" the @entity176 tabloids blared that the giant timepiece had been felled by the @entity49 worm			1
" the post ends with this statement : " in case you have n't guessed it yet , @entity2 ! ! ! " some have compared the situation to @entity186 in 2000 , when many feared the world 's computers would crash but few problems were seen			1
@entity24 said that comparison does n't fit			0
" @entity192 was a one - time event , " he said			0
" the update for @entity49 has basically prepped it for its future			2
it now has the ability to gather marching orders in a way that , to date , we have n't found a way to block			0
" little is know about @entity49 's author			2
a piece of code in a version of the computer worm prevents the program from harming machines in @entity209 , leading some to believe that 's where the program 's author lives			2
others say that could be a ploy			0
many authors of previous computer viruses have come from @entity220 outside the jurisdiction of the @entity222 , experts said			0
@entity223 , senior director of a research team at @entity225 , a computer security company , said the author may try to split up pieces of the infected computer network -- called a botnet -- and sell them to bidders			0
the many unknowns about @entity49 are what make it particularly concerning , said @entity235 , senior vice president of technology for @entity236			2
" [ an attack ] could happen today , it could happen april 15 , it could happen two months from now , " he said			0
@entity24 says an attack will happen sooner or later			0
" they 'll wait for the hype to subside , " he said			0
" they 'll wait for everyone to stop watching , and they 'll take it for a test run			0
they 've put together one hell of a botnet here , and they 're going to want to exercise it			0

@entity22 worm active in computers , but so far causes no harm
experts are working with 116 countries to combat the worm
@entity168 blog mocks @entity49 situation in @entity2 blog
@entity22 is thought to have infected up to 10 million computers
