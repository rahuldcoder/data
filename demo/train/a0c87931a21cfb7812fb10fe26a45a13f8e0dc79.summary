@entity0 -- at just after midnight on saturday , in a bar down an old lane in @entity0 , the band suddenly stops playing			0
grabbing the microphone , the manager tells everyone to remain in the venue ; the police are outside threatening to escort to the nearest police station any foreigner not carrying valid documents			1
this is just one of many incidents that have occurred in @entity0 over the weekend following last week 's launch of a 100 - day campaign to " clean out " non-chinese living or working illegally in the city			1
until the end of august , all foreigners are expected to always have on them a valid passport , visa and resident permit , as stipulated by an announcement on @entity0 , the official @entity27 account on popular @entity30 micro-blogging site @entity28			1
if not , they will face repercussions , which range from fines to police detention and deportation			0
a number for a hotline locals can call to report suspicious foreigners was also included in the announcement			1
since then , the police presence in the main expat and student areas of the city has noticeably increased , households and companies have been spot checked , and queues at local police stations to register residency are large			1
@entity48 , media officer of the @entity49 under the @entity50 , was not available to immediately comment when asked about the crackdown			0
however , last week in an editorial in the @entity53 , he remarked : " some foreigners do not know @entity30 laws well , and they might feel strange being randomly questioned by the police , but it is necessary to improve their legal awareness and make sure they stick to @entity30 regulations			1
" @entity0 police announced on thursday that the city 's friendly attitude toward foreigners has not changed			1
" @entity0 will stick to the policy of reform and opening up , and we sincerely welcome foreign friends to work and live in @entity0 , " a spokesman told the state - run @entity67 news agency , adding that foreigners ' legitimate rights will be @entity71 but the crackdown has left a bitter taste in the mouths of many , not least those who have resided in the city for years and see it as home			1
media worker @entity83 was pulled off his bike by the police on saturday and demanded to produce his papers			0
" i have been living here for a decade and yet i still get treated like -- and sometimes called -- a foreign barbarian , " lamented the @entity87 , who speaks perfect @entity89 and is engaged to a @entity30 girl			1
another longtime expat , @entity93 , was equally distressed			1
" i have noticed a change in how i am treated			0
it has gone from curiosity to hostility , " commented @entity93			2
the 27 - year - old , an employee at a renewable energy firm , has been contemplating a move back to @entity102			0
these events will make his decision easier , he said			0
@entity105 was not the only person expressing a desire to leave in the wake of tensions			0
@entity110 , an @entity111 doing an internship , has no intention to renew her visa once it expires in september			2
" i never used to notice people looking at me on the streets , " she said			0
" now i do and it makes me feel really uncomfortable			0
" the campaign comes amid a heated online debate about the behavior of foreigners in @entity30			1
the most noticeable example has been the uploading of a video onto the @entity30 video sharing site @entity126 of a foreign man sexually assaulting a @entity30 woman in @entity0			1
the video attracted more than 11 million views and 80,000 comments to date			0
@entity0 police revealed the foreigner in the video to be a @entity135 on a tourist visa			2
police deny the incidents are related , but in the minds of both foreigners and @entity30 they are			1
prominent host on @entity141 , @entity142 , posted on @entity28 that @entity0 must clean out its " foreign trash " to " protect innocent girls			0
" according to @entity142 , they must " cut off the foreign snake heads			0
" similar rhetoric has been voiced by locals offline			2
when @entity0 resident @entity151 's mother caught wind of the video , she called her 26 - year - old daughter and asked her not to visit places that foreigners frequent			1
for both mother and daughter , the visa crackdown might not be an ideal solution , but it is necessary			2
" police can not tell who is good or not			0
some foreign men come here with the wrong intentions , " @entity151 said , adding : " we treat westerners too well and this needs to change			0
" according to statistics provided by the city government , @entity0 is home to about 120,000 foreigners			2
most have arrived during the past decade , attracted by a booming economy and a visa policy that has been relatively relaxed			2
crackdowns on this scale are very rare , with the last noticeable one being in the lead up to the @entity177			0
@entity178 , a professor of @entity30 history at @entity181 's @entity180 , who has lived in the capital on and off since the 1980s , says these incidents only occur when the government is feeling uneasy , " he commented , alluding to events that have gripped the nation over the past few months such as the dramatic fall from power of @entity191 party chief @entity190			1
whatever the cause , as @entity30 's economy continues to grow , its foreign population will likely rise too			1
finding a workable solution to the visa situation will become increasingly important .			2

new regulations demand all foreigners carry a valid passport , visa and resident permit
locals can also call a number for a hotline to report " suspicious foreigners "
campaign comes amid a heated online debate about poor behavior of foreigners in @entity30
some expat residents in @entity30 report increasing hostility towards them
