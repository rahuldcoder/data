@entity1 when i was just a child in @entity4 , @entity0 surprised the world by winning the @entity6 at @entity7			1
at the time , @entity0 was a desperately poor country			1
cricket was a unifying force			0
you could be @entity12 or @entity13 , @entity14 or @entity15 , but if you were @entity0 you were proud of a rare big win on the world stage			1
a few years later my family moved from @entity4 to @entity19			0
we had migrated from the birthplace of cricket to the game 's burgeoning new @entity23			1
@entity0 's 1983 win turned out to be a catalyst for a new enthusiasm for one - day cricket , the version of the sport in which the @entity6 is contested			1
( the longer version , test cricket , takes five days per game ; a @entity34 has never been feasible			2
) my most vivid memories of my childhood in @entity0 are of cricket			1
@entity0 was crazy about it			1
a public holiday meant putting up makeshift stumps on the main road and starting a game			2
at school we would squeeze in a quick match in our 20 minute tiffin break			2
no ball ? no problem			0
our ball was a stone with a handkerchief wrapped around it			0
no bat ? we played " hand cricket			0
" no stumps ? well , that 's what tree trunks were for			2
an @entity0 child could conjure up cricket paraphernalia from anywhere			2
i was no good at cricket			0
and yet i could n't help but get swept up in the national frenzy			0
when @entity0 played another country it was a monumental event			2
we would feign fevers on the big games to skip school ; then we 'd try and sneak into the stadiums			0
@entity19 's @entity73 , its stands heaving with 100,000 cricket fanatics , was a sight to see			0
as we grew more middle class and more homes acquired color tvs , we would huddle together to watch games at home			0
how far we 've come			0
today , a billion viewers are expected to tune in to watch @entity0 play			1
and it 's not just any game : it 's @entity0 versus @entity85			1
those are three words that conjure up all kinds of images			0
the two countries have fought three wars			0
our childhoods were filled with propaganda videos and movies of the evil enemy			0
but @entity0 versus @entity85 has also been a moment to bring the two countries together			1
i remember 2004 when @entity0 toured @entity85 after a fifteen year break			1
thousands of @entity0 fans got their first glimpse of @entity103 soil when they got special visas to attend games			2
in 2007 , when i visited @entity85 for the first time , the instant ice breaker was always cricket : imagine picking a fantasy team with the best players from either country ! after the 2008 @entity113 attacks , i remember the hostility so many @entity0 felt towards @entity85 ; all diplomatic contact was broken off			1
and then in 2011 , cricket provided the opening			2
@entity85 's prime minister visited @entity0 to watch a @entity6 semi final game			1
peace and common sense were bigger winners			0
the @entity0 historian @entity123 describes a great anecdote about the evolution of the @entity0 - @entity85 game			1
in 1996 , when @entity85 visited his hometown of @entity128 , @entity123 made sure he was in attendance			2
the legendary @entity103 batsman @entity130 was playing his final match			0
@entity123 dared to stand up and applaud			0
no one else in his stand did			0
many years later , in 2005 , things had changed			0
@entity85 won an epic game of many twists and turns at @entity128 's @entity137			1
this time many @entity0 applauded			2
@entity123 describes the change as a larger evolution in the @entity0 psyche			2
as @entity0 has become more successful , more middle class , and less worried about imminent war with the @entity103 , it has found within itself a confidence to be sportsmanlike			1
i could n't agree more			0
there is a maturity to the @entity0 @entity85 game now that i do n't remember in my childhood			1
back then it felt like war			0
if @entity85 won , it was because their @entity155 players were meat eaters , they were much stronger , @entity0 would lament			1
now , of course , @entity0 is one of the world 's largest consumers of fish and meat			1
back then , @entity0 's place in the world felt forever linked with @entity85 's			1
back then , there was a phrase to describe @entity0 's lackluster economic progress : " the @entity169 rate of growth			1
now cricket is a game -- still the most important one -- but just a game			0
no doubt , my views are colored by my own journey , my growing up			0
but when you consider that 65 % of all @entity0 were born in the 1980s or later , well after the two big wars of the 1970s , perhaps young @entity0 have a different relationship with ' @entity0 versus @entity85			1
' so let the games begin , and may the best team win			0
by a strange quirk , while @entity85 has a better record against @entity0 in both @entity183 and one day cricket , @entity0 has won all five of its @entity6 games against @entity85			1
if the odds finally catch up with @entity0 and the nation does n't engulf itself in a period of collective mourning , it will be one more small step forward for a new , confident nation			2
go @entity0 , and go @entity85 !			1

arch - rivals @entity0 and @entity85 face off at the @entity6 in @entity196 today
a *shared* love of the game has provided an opening during times of tension between the *neighbors*
@entity0 's *attitude* towards the match - ups has matured as it has become more successful , writes @entity207
