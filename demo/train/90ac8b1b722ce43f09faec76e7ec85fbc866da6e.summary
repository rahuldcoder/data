-- throughout my career as a doctor i have traveled from the mountains of @entity5 to its deserts			1
i have seen first hand what happens when children give birth to children			0
i have seen the tombstones of girls who died too young because they married too young			1
@entity5 is one of only two countries in the world with no legislation on a minimum age of marriage			1
with a national dialogue underway to establish a new constitution , there is now a chance to establish a safe age of marriage , protecting young girls who are currently married off as young as 9 years old			1
as i advocate to end child marriage in @entity5 , i always remember my best friend at school			1
we would talk about our future and what we wanted to be when we grew up			0
we had big aspirations , as young girls should			1
my friend was the smartest girl in our class			0
but when she was 13 , she was told to leave school to prepare for her wedding			0
we were all so upset			0
i still remember her wedding day as we tried to support her			0
it was such a sad day for us all , a stark comparison for so many whose wedding day is remembered as the happiest of their lives			0
my parents did not want me to marry as a child			2
they were my firewall , protecting me from the pressure of all the people in my community who said i should marry			0
they were determined to give me a brighter future			0
as i carried on my studies , and became a doctor , the image of my friend 's wedding always stayed with me			0
so many girls in my country do n't have the right to say " no , i do n't want that man or this kind of life			1
" my friend moved away and we did n't stay in touch			0
my friend 's story is not unusual			0
the @entity73 estimates that one in three girls in @entity5 are married before 18			1
around the world , approximately 14 million girls are married as children every year			1
the right to choose to think of all the girls in my country who are forced into marriage , lose their personalities , their happiness and just have to obey what they are told to do , is what drives me forward in my work			1
child brides do n't talk about it , but they suffer			2
a recent study in @entity5 has shown that girls who have their rights taken from them in this way do not forgive their parents , and there is a breakdown of family relationships			1
as a doctor i see the complications young girls are suffering from as they give birth before their bodies are ready			1
girls not brides , a civil society network campaigning against child marriage , suggests that girls under 15 are five times more likely to die giving birth			1
read more : @entity5 girl goes on @entity110 to plea for education , not marriage @entity5 has one of the highest maternal death rates in the world			1
according to the @entity117 , one in 90 women die in childbirth in my country			2
i can not bear to continue to watch young women giving up their lives and having to give birth too young			2
we must support our girls and women by providing better maternal health care , access to family planning and safe abortion			2
we must work together to end early marriage so that all girls have the right to choose when and whom to marry and are able to finish their education , strengthening the bonds that are so important to us , with our friends and our family			2
we know how to fix these problems			0
we can tackle many issues if we tackle early marriage			2
together in partnership with the @entity117 in @entity5 and many other activists we have been campaigning for a safe age of marriage for many years			1
since the uprising in 2011 , a new constitution is being drafted in my country			2
this is an opportunity to establish a minimum age of marriage			0
but it is a narrow window of opportunity			0
too often girls have no voice , no choice , no access			0
i am determined to help them have a better future			0
my friend did not fulfill her dream , but by ending child marriage together we can make sure that girls in @entity5 and around the world can fulfill theirs			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity166 .			2

campaigners in @entity5 want *law* against child marriage in the country
around one third of girls married before they are 18 , according to the @entity73
@entity166 says younger marriage leads to more complications during childbirth
some girls are sent into arranged marriages as young as 9 years old
