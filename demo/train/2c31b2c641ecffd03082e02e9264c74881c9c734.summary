-- the checkered flag has only just fallen on the final @entity3 race of the year in @entity4 but the sport 's top car designer is already predicting a spicy 2014 season			1
@entity8 is the man behind the @entity10 racer that has powered @entity11 and the team to four straight world championships			1
but the @entity14 is not taking @entity10 's dominance for granted as major rule changes loom on the horizon			1
next year , each team must package its car around a new turbo engine as well as complying with aerodynamic rule changes which will mainly affect the design of the cars ' front and rear wings			1
" the aerodynamic changes are big , " explained @entity8 to @entity3			2
" but they are smaller than the changes we had in 2009			0
" so yes , there is the chance that one team comes up with a car that is better than their rivals ' , but on top of that you have the engine changes			1
" what is absolutely unclear is whether one engine manufacturer will be able to come up with a significant advantage			2
" but the car that will brush aside all others will be a car having the combination of good engine and good chassis -- if one side is letting you down you will have a problem			1
" who will come up with the ideal combination ? that 's the big guessing game for all of us and will add spice to the 2014 season			1
" @entity10 will continue to be powered by @entity54 while @entity55 and @entity56 will pit their new 1.6 - litre , v6 engines against the @entity59 engine manufacturer			1
the 2014 cars will also rely on more hybrid power harvested from @entity62 ( @entity62 )			2
while these elements of the car are out of @entity68 's hands , the @entity14 , who says he has received offers to join rival teams , remains in charge of @entity10 's car design as the team 's chief technical officer			1
there has already been speculation within the sport that the 2014 cars will be less easy on the eye than this season 's sleek racers			2
it 's a theory that also irks @entity8 , who still uses a drawing board to sketch out the design of his peerless machines			1
" ideally the car is fast and has a stylish design , " the former @entity84 and @entity85 designer continued			2
" but everybody in the paddock will give a fast car preference over an attractive car -- that 's the way it is			0
" yes , for me it would be good if a bit more consideration was given to aesthetics in the drafting of the regulations			0
but fast is paramount over beauty			0
" @entity8 and his team of more than 100 engineers have been working on @entity10 's 2014 for many months , even while juggling the demands of winning current championships			1
amazing brain but the @entity14 , rated as the sport 's leading car designer , was still willing to share some tips on preparing for a major rule change -- even if there could be a slight danger that rivals such as @entity56 , @entity55 and @entity85 might just pinch some of his ideas			1
" the first thing that you do is to read the regulations -- very , very carefully , " he explained			0
" you try to read what they actually say , rather than what they intend to say , as this is not always the same thing			0
" after that i 'm actually breaking it down into bite - size chunks			0
then you try to understand from the regulations the aerodynamic and mechanical packaging that appears to be the best solutions for those different areas			0
" you go away and research them and at some point try to bring it all back together again			0
for me that is the important bit : the end product should be a whole and not pieces thrown together into one cluster			0
" does it still look a good idea after 24 hours ? that decides whether it gets a tick or a cross			0
" actually , you develop a sensibility for that procedure			0
the brain is an amazing thing : you might be doing something completely different -- maybe making a cup of tea -- and suddenly you know right from wrong ! " the most coveted designer in @entity3 will find out whether he has got it right or wrong when testing for the new season begins next january .			2

@entity10 car designer @entity8 says 2014 rule changes will spice up new season
he says it is a " guessing game " which team will have best engine / chassis combination
@entity8 says he would like the rules to consider car aesthetics more than they do
@entity14 says he has a " 24 - hour " rule he applies to all his design ideas
