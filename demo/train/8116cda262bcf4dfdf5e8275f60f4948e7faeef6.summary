-- the @entity6 legal advocate @entity5 , facing the end of his fellowship at @entity4 , has claimed that @entity4 is forcing him out due to @entity6 pressure			1
@entity4 's participation in a complex deal to allow @entity5 to leave @entity6 to study gave the dissident and his family breathing space , and helped the @entity12 and @entity6 untangle a thorny diplomatic dilemma after @entity5 fled to the @entity12 embassy in @entity15 in april 2012			1
@entity4 in fact did a great favor not only for @entity5 but also for both the @entity12 and @entity6 governments			1
@entity4 's spokesman says the end of @entity5 's fellowship " has nothing to do with the @entity6 government ; all fellowships come to an end			1
" @entity5 has , in any case , other job options			0
but whether there was @entity6 pressure or not in this case , @entity5 's experience and allegations highlight the many challenges faced by @entity12 academic institutions in the context of evolving @entity6 - @entity12 relations			1
despite criticism of its cost , content , admissions criteria or tenure system , @entity12 post-secondary education , be it at top - tier research institutions , private liberal arts colleges or large state universities , remains the best worldwide			2
that 's why students from all over the world strive to come here			0
along with high - tech and @entity53 , our university education is among @entity12 's top exports , something we still do better than any other country			0
@entity6 dissident : @entity4 is forcing me out and @entity6 , perhaps more than anywhere , reveres education			2
more scholars than generals occupy @entity6 's pantheon of national heroes			0
besides @entity66 and @entity67 , there 's @entity68 , patron saint of intellectuals , whom @entity6 commemorate this time every year with dragon boats and rice wrapped in bamboo leaves			0
@entity6 parents across the social spectrum struggle to give their children the best education			0
not surprisingly , then , as @entity6 become wealthier , more @entity6 students flock to the @entity12 to study			2
@entity12 universities , too , are opening satellite branches to serve this market within @entity6			1
meanwhile , the @entity6 state is attempting to promote @entity6 - language study and enhance its " soft power " in the @entity12 by installing @entity84 on @entity12 campuses			2
@entity6 students and faculty engage in surprisingly open discourse , even criticism of their government , on campuses in @entity6			0
but the notion of academic freedom for its own sake is not a feature of @entity6 universities			1
rather , the general expectation ( not always accepted by students and faculty ) is that education should serve the state			0
the @entity6 state thus attempts to control the message on its campuses			0
in @entity12 colleges and universities , on the other hand , academic freedom is tied to our ideal that education is primarily for the benefit of the individual , and that it is by empowering individuals of diverse outlooks that society as a whole benefits the most			1
two tendencies are now converging , just as @entity12 and @entity6 academic communities become more inter-meshed			2
rising @entity6 has taken steps to export and police the message on campuses abroad by denying visas to @entity12 academic critics or pressuring universities over dissidents or speeches by such figures as the @entity129			2
meanwhile , cash - strapped @entity12 institutions increasingly value @entity6 as a market ; deans and provosts , gung - ho about their flashy new @entity6 initiatives , have not been as supportive of academic freedom as they should			1
if @entity5 's departure from @entity4 owes anything to @entity6 pressure , his is but one , high - profile case			1
as we go forward , should more such incidents arise , here 's what both sides should do : @entity6 , please abandon counterproductive efforts to intimidate foreign institutions and scholars			1
@entity151 - fisted bullying only undermines the very soft power that was your goal in the first place , and ticks off the teachers who teach foreigners about @entity6			0
and deans and provosts at @entity12 institutions : do n't be craven about academic freedom			1
join together with other institutions and take a firm , principled stand to support scholars			0
do n't be afraid to do what @entity4 did in hosting a dissident or to take bold steps if @entity6 denies a visa to one of your professors			2
we are the no. 1 global brand in university education , largely because of our principles			0
where else is @entity6 going to go ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity178 .			0

dissident @entity5 says @entity4 asked him to leave due to @entity6 pressure
