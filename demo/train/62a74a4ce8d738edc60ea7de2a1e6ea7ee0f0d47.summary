an international operation led by @entity2 aimed at child pornography and sexual abuse has resulted in the arrest of 245 suspects , officials announced thursday			1
all but 23 of the suspects were apprehended in the @entity8			0
the agency said that during the course of @entity12 , law enforcement officers identified 123 victims of child exploitation and removed 44 of those children from their alleged abusers with whom they were living			1
the other cases involved victims who were exploited by people outside their homes or children who were harmed years ago and are now adults			1
several of the children were shockingly young			1
five were under age 3			2
nine were between the ages of 4 and 6			0
of the 123 victims , 110 lived in the @entity8 in 19 different states			1
@entity2 officials did not identify the six other countries where victims were identified or where some of the arrests were made , citing the need to work discreetly with international law enforcement partners			1
according to @entity2 , some of those arrested during @entity12 were registered sex offenders			1
@entity12 was conducted in november and december , but efforts are continuing on other cases			2
during a news conference , ice director @entity41 said the agency was calling on the public to provide tips and mentioned several open investigations			2
one of those cases involves the sexual molestation of an unidentified girl thought to be around 13			0
investigators believe the abuse took place about 11 years ago , but the pornographic images were widely circulated			2
@entity2 has posted pictures of an unidentified woman and man suspected of abusing the girl on its website			0
the woman has some distinctive tattoos that investigators hope will lead to tips about her identity			0
based on a forensic analysis of the pornographic images in that case , investigators think the abuse occurred in the @entity70 or @entity69 area of @entity71			2
although the girl may now be an adult , @entity2 officials want to identify and prosecute the suspects and prevent them from harming new victims			2
" forensic analysis technology has become critical in the fight against child exploitation , " @entity41 said			0
" we are coming across these images on the @entity81			0
they are being produced in one country but shared literally around the world , often in real time			0
" @entity41 said @entity2 works with other law enforcement agencies and with the @entity87 to look for clues in the pictures of abuse to identify where the acts occurred and track down the victims and perpetrators			1
the name @entity12 was chosen to commemorate a case from 2011 in which @entity97 law enforcement officials shared images and chat board information about a 16 - year - old boy who allegedly planned to rape an 11 - year - old girl			1
one image taken from a moving car showed a road sign with a sunflower on it			0
@entity2 's @entity108 determined that the road sign was unique to @entity110			0
agents were then able to find the exact stretch of road where the picture was taken and to locate the girl			0
18 rescued in child pornography raids , feds say 3 @entity119 brothers extradited to @entity8 to face 25 counts linked to sex trafficking			1
