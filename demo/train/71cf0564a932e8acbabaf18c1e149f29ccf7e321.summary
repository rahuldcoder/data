@entity0 -- at first glance , the brightness of the colors might just be enough to fool the casual viewer			1
but this abstract scene in " @entity7 " is n't a cheerful one			2
" here 's a person who wants to kill another person , " says artist @entity10 , as he points towards a menacing figure in the composition , " and here 's a person who wants to defend this person from being killed			1
" @entity10 's canvas is inspired by conflict - namely , the brutal civil war raging in his homeland of @entity23			1
it 's just one of several works on display at the @entity27 in @entity0			1
in the exhibit , entitled " @entity28 " , @entity10 along with two other @entity23 artists , @entity30 and @entity31 , tackle warfare through works encompassing themes such as hope , survival and society			1
" the violence pushes me to work more , to draw and paint , " explains @entity10 , an intense young man who 's well aware how much he 's been impacted by the violence			1
" it 's apparent in the faces , " he says , describing the characters who inhabit another one of his creations , " the abnormalities - these are internal abnormalities more than external			1
" @entity10 's striking images are made all the more poignant when he describes the horror of learning how close relatives of his were recently executed			1
" i never imagined this would happen to anyone in my family , " explains a visibly upset @entity10 , " or that i would hear this news about anybody in my life			2
" exiled @entity23 writer honored for @entity10 and his colleagues , art is what keeps them going through the toughest of times			1
as it turns out , the men are n't just close friends , they 're also former classmates , having studied together at the @entity67 ' @entity68 while the art scene in @entity71 had been growing more vibrant before the start of @entity23 's civil war , it quickly changed once clashes spread			1
" there 's more @entity23 artists being showcased in @entity78 because most of the galleries closed in @entity23 , especially in @entity71 , " says gallery owner @entity75			1
for @entity75 , who feels the art scene in @entity78 has grown somewhat stagnant , this showcase is a timely one			1
" it 's important to highlight the situation that 's going on in @entity23 , " says @entity75 , who adds that several @entity23 artists who fled the fighting have ended up in @entity0			1
young @entity23 amputee makes dangerous journey to find help for @entity30 , who left for @entity78 once it got too dangerous at home , it has been hard to remain optimistic			1
but he 's determined to do so			1
" the only thing that keeps us running and living is hope , " the soft - spoken artist adds			2
it 's hope that @entity30 tries to convey more than anything else in his paintings			1
dreamlike images in which bright colors offset an approaching darkness			2
" you know , art is all about a message , " explains @entity30			0
" you send the message for the people			0
" in " @entity111 " , @entity30 presents an idealized vision of peaceful coexistence - hustle and bustle in an urban environment free of strife			0
the symbolism could n't be more striking			0
a closer look reveals both a crescent and a cross in this cityscape			0
" we will remain looking for the future , " says @entity30			0
" for a bright future			0
that 's the whole idea			2
" just around the corner , however , the works of @entity127 highlight a very different feeling - one of dread			0
" you feel fear , " says @entity127			0
" you feel like anytime something can happen			0
" as the last member of this group still living in @entity71 , angst is part of his everyday reality			0
" i 'm inside @entity23			1
i can see the people			0
i can connect with them till now , " he says			0
that connection informs his art ; pieces full of foreboding			0
in " @entity148 " , a dying man is on display , with a gas mask on his face and a rose in his hand - clinging to hope while slipping away			0
melancholy seems to pervade @entity127 's personality			2
" sometimes when you feel down - you feel all these people are dead , you feel like your country is just destroyed - you feel you should do something maybe different than art " but those doubts do n't last long			0
@entity127 sees his job as a necessary one ; that as an artist , he must document what he 's feeling and seeing			2
" we feel sad , we feel tired			0
so for sure this will show in your colors			0
" the colors are as vivid as life - from artists taking their audience on an artistic journey that constantly reminds of death .			2
