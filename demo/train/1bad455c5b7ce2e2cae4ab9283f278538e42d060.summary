-- @entity1 marked his @entity3 debut with the winning goal , but it was not enough to put the @entity7 champions top of @entity8 after the opening day of matches			1
that honor went to @entity12 following the promoted side 's shock 2 - 1 victory over @entity16 earlier saturday			1
however , @entity3 's bid for a 30th scudetto began with few scares against the only team to have beaten the @entity22 side home and away last season			1
@entity1 , a $ 15 million arrival from @entity27 club @entity26 in preseason , started up front while fellow new forward signing @entity30 was on the substitutes ' bench			2
the @entity33 international was denied a first - half goal by keeper @entity36 , who also saved from @entity38 's header , but he made no mistake from close range in the 58th minute after being set up by @entity41			0
it was @entity1 's second goal for the club , having also netted in last sunday 's 4 - 0 @entity45 win over @entity46			2
that match was marred by racist chanting by some home fans , and as a result @entity46 's opening home match this season against @entity52 will be played with a section of the stands closed			0
@entity56 had substitute @entity57 sent off in time added on for a foul on @entity60			0
@entity30 was given a brief debut when he came on for @entity62 in the 89th minute , while @entity1 gave way to @entity63			0
@entity12 celebrated the end of the club 's 11 - year wait for a top - flight match , as veteran former @entity69 striker @entity68 headed two goals to defeat last season 's third - placed team @entity16			1
the seven - time @entity75 champions , held 1 - 1 by @entity77 club @entity76 in last week 's @entity79 qualifier , took the lead in the 14th minute when @entity81 set up midfielder @entity82			1
however , @entity68 headed home a corner just before the half - hour mark and the 36 - year - old repeated the feat from @entity89 's cross in the 53rd minute			0
@entity81 had two strong shouts for a penalty , but the @entity69 striker ended up with just a booking for his efforts after complaining bitterly when denied on the latter occasion .			0
