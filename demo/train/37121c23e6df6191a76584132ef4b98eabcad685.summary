these words were chiseled in granite above me , printed on the diploma in my hands and engraved on my class ring			0
i had just completed a four year regimen that had been honed over 174 years to be difficult			1
i had just graduated from @entity8			0
in return for four years of education , i owed the nation at least five years of @entity13 service			1
i became a " service member			1
" but like most of my peers , i was n't really thinking much about service			1
at age 21 , i was more focused on the adventures ahead -- of becoming a good officer and leading soldiers			0
after 34 years in the @entity22 military , i learned that armies are built soldier - by - soldier , platoon - by - platoon			0
like the bricks in a house , the soldiers in each unit contribute to a great military , just as the citizens of each neighborhood help determine whether the nation stands strong			2
nothing is more important than developing in our citizens a sense of responsibility to each other -- and to the nation			2
the @entity40 is an initiative that @entity43 chair at the @entity44			0
our goal is to have 1 million young americans each complete a civilian service year by 2023			1
we envision an @entity22 version of national service that is voluntary but socially expected			2
today , as part of this effort , i 'm calling for a few cities across the country to step up and lead by becoming @entity54			1
what if , upon graduating from high school , every young person in these cities is given an opportunity to complete a service year with other young people ? each city could commit to a plan with an initial goal of having at least 25 % of their graduating students from high schools stay in their communities to serve for a year			1
like many @entity22 , i believe our country would benefit greatly if we were to unite around a commitment to service			2
creating model towns and cities of service across @entity22 could provide powerful local examples that capture our collective imagination and create ripple effects for more service opportunities			1
i 've seen the benefits firsthand			0
in early 1977 , i joined the @entity80 and found myself leading a platoon of paratroopers			0
most of my platoon came from modest backgrounds and had joined the still young " @entity13 " for financial reasons			2
it was a built - in cultural clash , as i , the son and grandson of career officers , fresh from the cloistered world of @entity8 , was put in charge of a group of young men who came from different socio - economic and ethnic backgrounds			2
but despite our differences , we all came together to solve complex problems			0
in the process , often haltingly , we watched each other grow -- first into comrades -- and slowly , almost imperceptibly , into professionals			0
together we had become real soldiers and real citizens			0
i 'm not the first soldier to notice the unique advantage we gain as a country when mechanisms are put in place to bring people of diverse backgrounds together around shared values			0
in 1796 , president @entity114 wrote that it was " of the highest importance ... that ( in ) the juvenal period of life , when friendships are formed , and habits established , that will stick by one ; the youth ... from different parts of the @entity22 would be assembled together , and would by degrees discover that there was not that cause for those jealousies and prejudices which one part of the @entity130 had imbibed against another part			0
" president @entity114 's words ring even truer in today 's @entity22 , where we see disconnectedness starkly within our own communities			0
if i were graduating from high school today , i 'd be less likely to have experienced the world alongside someone different from me			0
my high school would be less diverse than it was in 1970			0
i would likely live around people who made just as much money as my parents			0
the creation of @entity54 around our country would enable us to make progress toward overcoming these divides while solving pressing local problems			1
as part of this @entity152 effort , cities would commit to growing service year opportunities for young people and include this in the city 's strategic planning , as mayor @entity158 has done in @entity159 , @entity160			1
@entity161 plans to double its number of service year opportunities from 5,000 to 10,000			1
another template for a @entity152 could focus on mobilizing universities and community colleges to commit to a plan that integrates a service year into their students ' experience			1
@entity171 and @entity172 have both created such programs within the last year			2
depending on the needs of your city , young people could be mobilized in one or two major projects , or placed in an array of organizations across the city			2
the young people in your city 's service cohort would also have an opportunity to interact with one another through social events in the city , joint training , and educational seminars			1
the participants would be part of an alumni group that could serve as a civic resource for your city for decades to come			0
this will not be easy , but it is completely possible			0
i learned from my decades as a soldier that the best solutions are designed by people closest to the problem			0
the experience would make these young people better community members , employees , citizens and leaders			2
our partners at the @entity211 are building a @entity54 exchange , an online platform to connect all the young people , service organizations and funders			1
in part to assuage the concerns of parents worried that a service year could get their kids off track , the @entity40 , and others are working to ensure that a service year becomes an accelerant to getting a job and gaining admission to college			1
imagine if your town were able to look at a huge cohort of your young people as proudly as our country looks at our men and women in uniform			2
i fundamentally believe that @entity54 have the power to transform our culture of service and ultimately create a country in which all young @entity22 have the opportunity to serve			1
this experience would not just change the trajectory of one young person 's life for the better , but the trajectory of our cities and our nation as a whole			1
follow @entity253 and @entity254 @ @entity255			1

@entity254 : i call for cities across the nation to lead by becoming @entity54
@entity254 : what if one million young americans each complete a civilian service year by 2023 ?
