@entity1 's @entity0 speaks exclusively with friends and family members about @entity4 's last days in " @entity4 : his final days , " 8 p.m. et friday on @entity1			1
( @entity6 ) -- one year after his untimely death , it 's clear that @entity4 's legacy lives on			1
his influence over the worlds of music and fashion is still strong enough that @entity15 -- currently the reigning queen of the charts and an undisputed master in the @entity4 - pioneered art of manufacturing buzz -- recently hoisted her own star even higher by announcing that she 'd been asked to open for ( and duet with ) the @entity4 on his ill - fated " @entity23 " tour			1
it 's not surprising that she 'd boast : like virtually every other singer of her generation , @entity15 owes an enormous creative debt to @entity4			1
and it goes way beyond the innovative role he played as a trailblazer of the music video ( although @entity15 's latest mega-efforts in that field certainly do credit to the form			0
) @entity37 : @entity15 's most gaga outfits @entity4 was dressing in over-the - top metallic ensembles back when @entity15 was still in diapers , and though the elaborate masked outfits she 's worn everywhere from the @entity43 to her little sister 's high school graduation may have a high - fashion precedent , they also call to mind the period when a paparazzi - weary @entity4 began parading around @entity48 in a burka			2
@entity50 , too , has lately taken a few pages out of @entity4 's book			2
last week , an exec at her label announced that " our bar for [ her next ] album is @entity4 's ' @entity58 , ' " meaning they 're hoping that every song on it is a hit			0
@entity37 : @entity50 's best looks ever she sampled his " @entity65 " for her song " @entity74 , " and she 's been seen in a number of @entity69 garments , most recently a pair of shining ankle socks that strongly evoked his signature sequined pair			0
@entity37 : @entity77 channel @entity4 's iconic style but one would be hard - pressed to find a pop star who has n't been influenced by @entity4 's inimitable style : @entity81 dances in natty black and white and a very @entity4 hat in the video for his current smash , " @entity86			1
" @entity87 , too , has borrowed @entity4 's sense of showmanship -- and , at times , his fedora			0
@entity37 : stars pay tribute to @entity4 the rhinestone - laden jean shorts that @entity95 donned for her new " @entity97 " clip call @entity4 to mind -- he loved to add improbable amounts of glitz to quotidian items , like jackets , shirts , and ( again ) socks			0
and the shining metallic ornament @entity105 wore on her left hand throughout the " @entity108 " era seemed inspired , in part , by @entity4 's single glove			0
even eleven - year - old actor @entity111 -- who was born well after the @entity4 's heyday ( and is himself the spawn of another musician , former fresh prince @entity114 ) -- recently pledged allegiance to @entity4 's style : at the june 10th premiere of his film " @entity118 , " he walked the red carpet in black pants , a crisp white shirt and a carbon copy of @entity4 's red - and - black leather " @entity58 " jacket			1
@entity37 : @entity4 's 10 greatest fashion hits from @entity15 to @entity111 and so many more before , @entity4 's influence and reach spans stars of all ages and genres			2
