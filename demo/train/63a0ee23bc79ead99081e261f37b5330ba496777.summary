the police shooting death of a man who allegedly hurled rocks at vehicles and officers in @entity6 , @entity7 , has sparked anger at what some say is another example of police brutality and excessive force			1
about 100 protesters marched outside @entity17 wednesday , with some chanting " it was only a rock , " @entity8 affiliate @entity15 reported			2
later in the evening , more protesters took to the intersection where the shooting occurred			1
police say the man -- who was later identified as @entity24 , 35 -- had allegedly been throwing rocks at cars and trucks when he was confronted by officers			1
officers attempted " voice commands and low level force , " and used a taser , police said , but those efforts were unsuccessful			1
after two officers were struck with rocks -- at least one of them as large as a softball -- police said the officers resorted to deadly force			1
