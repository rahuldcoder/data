-- president @entity2 's surprise decision to seek congressional approval for a strike in @entity5 was a gamble that will likely succeed and over time may be judged deft			1
but the way he got there has also raised troubling questions about his leadership in foreign affairs			0
history strongly favors congressional backing			0
over the past two centuries , presidents have asked @entity17 to approve the use of force before a coordinated military engagement on 18 occasions			1
every time , the answer has been at least a qualified yes			0
the current @entity17 , of course , is also one of the most partisan and rambunctious of the past century , so there is a risk they will turn him down			1
but in the end , a majority -- especially in the @entity29 -- are likely to follow the example of sen. @entity32			0
despite his disagreements with the proposed strike ( a " pinprick " to him ) , the @entity34 @entity33 has concluded that it would be catastrophic for the country to strip the president of his authority and prestige as commander in chief			0
that argument -- along with others about the risks of emboldening @entity5 and @entity50 , appearing to leave @entity51 exposed and failing to act in the face of such horrific crimes -- will surely carry weight			1
tactically , the president 's decision to seek approval got him out of a box			0
when the @entity60 @entity59 on thursday unexpectedly rejected military action , @entity2 was placed in a perilous position			1
he was almost a @entity63 in trying to punish the regime of @entity65 , with no @entity67 support , a growing " coalition of the unwilling " ( a nice phrase from @entity69 ) , weak support in polls at home and a squalling @entity17			1
by asking for approval , he might not only build a firmer foundation for a strike , but he has also regained a consistency with the view that he and his top team have been arguing since the invasion of @entity81 a decade ago : that the road to @entity84 military action should go through @entity85			1
as a senator , vice president @entity86 even threatened impeachment against president @entity89 if he struck @entity50 without congressional approval			0
for @entity2 , it is also possible that the delay for a congressional vote will one day be seen as tactically shrewd			2
already , he is receiving more help internationally			0
@entity96 has come out publicly for military action , the @entity95 has toughened its stance and the @entity99 has now called for punishment of the @entity65 regime for using chemical weapons			0
@entity2 's trip to the @entity104 next week gives him a chance to round up more support			1
but there is no doubt that he and his team still have a lot of work to do to convince the skeptics , and nowhere is that more important than with the @entity84 public			2
members of @entity17 know full well how uneasy many of their constituents are			2
they will soon be demanding that the president win over more of the public as a price for their own support			2
there is a good chance we will hear an address from the @entity125 on the eve of congressional voting			0
however this episode comes out , the president and his team -- despite flashes of tactical proficiency -- have been hurt by the uneven path they have taken to this point			2
at home and abroad , observers watch carefully and calibrate their own responses by whether they think the @entity84 commander in chief and his team have a firm hand on the tiller			1
in this case , unfortunately , the overall leadership has looked shaky and hesitant			0
what is needed above all is a sound long - term strategy for the @entity145 that is communicated to the world			1
admittedly , that is very hard to do with the region in turmoil			0
but the world was also complicated and fluid after @entity152 and president @entity153 and his team put together a strategy that worked for half a century and helped to win the @entity155			2
@entity153 turned out to be a celebrated leader			0
in retrospect , as @entity158 wrote this weekend on @entity0 in a stinging critique of the @entity160 , it is clear that when @entity2 drew his " red line " a year ago against @entity5 use of chemical weapons , he was making an off - the - cuff bluff with little thought behind it			1
that " red line " comment set off a chain of events that has made experts shake their heads			0
more recently , the surprise of saturday 's decision to consult @entity17 after weeks of beating the war drums has left many world leaders -- not least @entity60 prime minister @entity178 , who with the potential for a @entity84 strike looming , tried and failed to win the @entity60 parliament 's authorization to support it -- feeling whiplash			1
for the sake of the country as well as a just , stable @entity145 , one hopes the president will succeed in bringing @entity65 and his thugs to account for their crimes against humanity			1
but it is surely important as well that he and his team emerge from this storm with a stronger grip on the journey ahead			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity197 and @entity198 .			1

@entity197 , @entity198 : @entity2 asking @entity17 ' ok on @entity5 , a gamble that will likely succeed
but they say the move follows an uneven strategy on @entity5 that has hurt his support
they say it also *realigns* @entity2 with his own position before the invasion of @entity81
writers : @entity84 needs long - term strategy on @entity145 to show world it has firm grip
