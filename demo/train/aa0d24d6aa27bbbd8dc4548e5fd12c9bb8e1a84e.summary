-- thank you for your service			1
we say those words more frequently now -- when we see men and women in uniform at the airport , when we accept a paper poppy from a veteran at the supermarket , when we sit next to a member of the military at a ballgame			1
thank you for your service			1
it 's a nice gesture , true , but small			1
we say it , but then most of us go back to the rest of our lives			1
it 's a volunteer military these days , after all ; we do n't have to serve , and we do n't have to remember			1
so we do n't have to think about the bitter cold of the @entity21 in the @entity22			1
we do n't have to think about the steaming , confused jungles of the @entity25 , a war whose 50th anniversary is now being commemorated			1
we do n't have to think about @entity28 , and up - armored humvees , and downed helicopters			1
we do n't have to think about the sacrifices			1
* * * she with thin form presently drest in black , by day her meals untouch 'd , then at night / fitfully sleeping , often waking , in the midnight waking , weeping , longing with / one deep longing , o that she might withdraw unnoticed , silent / from life escape and withdraw , to follow , to seek , to be with her dear dead / son			1
-- @entity45 , " @entity43 , @entity44 " since @entity46 was first observed in 1868 as @entity46 , initially a way to honor @entity48 dead , more than 600,000 @entity50 servicemen and women have died in war			1
they all went marching into the unknown , and not all of them came back			1
@entity57 : your tributes to fallen loved ones when they 're gone , their loved ones must carry on			1
@entity63 ' husband , @entity64 cpl. @entity62 , was 22 when he died in @entity65 five years ago			1
she was young , she was told ; she 'll meet someone else , marry someone else			2
she was given the names of support groups , but they were filled with people much older			2
it was n't until she met the widow of one of her husband 's comrades that she found her way forward			2
" for me , it was inspiring , " @entity62 , a 2011 @entity79 @entity78 , said			2
" like , ' man , if she can get up every day and do this with a child , i can do this			1
... i ca n't let her down			2
' " @entity62 founded the @entity63 , " dedicated to the new generation of those who have lost the heroes of yesterday , today and tomorrow , " according to its website			1
through it , @entity62 has helped people like her connect			2
and through it , she has found new meaning			2
" they 've given me the gift of life again , " she said			2
@entity101 also lost a family member -- his wife , navy lt. @entity103			1
@entity103 was killed in @entity104 in 2009			2
@entity105 is part of an uncommon group : widowers of war , a creation of the changing landscape of the @entity50 military , as @entity0 's @entity113 observed			2
@entity101 is also the father of a young girl			2
" i was thrust into a role i was n't familiar with , " @entity101 said			2
the years since have been difficult			2
most challenging has been raising his daughter as a single father			0
but , @entity101 says , the two share an unbreakable bond			0
" we 've been through so much together and in so many uncharted territories together			0
" * * * " if truth is the main casualty in war , ambiguity is another			0
" -- @entity125 , " @entity126 " we want our war stories to be clean , to be triumphant tales of good over evil , shorn of shades of gray			1
to his family and friends , he was an honored ex-marine , the business consultant with the medals			0
but @entity134 was haunted by his experiences in @entity25			0
finally , he sought help			0
he was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder			0
counseling made a difference ; so did faith			0
he 's written two books about his experiences , a novel and a memoir , books that are both inspirational and cautionary			0
now he wants others to remember , too			1
" when the peace treaty is signed , the war is n't over for the veterans or the family , " he says			0
" it 's just starting			0
" @entity158 , on the other hand , always wants to remember			1
@entity159 was the 10 - year - old boy from @entity161 who lost his father , @entity162 , in @entity104 and sent an @entity163 to @entity0 as a way to commemorate him			1
the story inspired more than 230 ireports and received thousands of responses			0
not only is there a college fund for @entity158 ; the @entity170 set up accounts to handle college tuition and room and board expenses for the children of every @entity64 family who died in the chinook helicopter crash that killed @entity158 's father , an army officer			0
@entity158 , for the most part , is doing well			0
but his uncle , @entity180 , says the boy 's father remains in the family 's heart			0
" @entity162 is with us all the time , every day his memory is alive for us			1
@entity188 spent just one month with her husband , @entity64 spec. @entity189 , before he left for @entity25 in 1969			1
six months after that , he was dead			1
it took more than 42 years , but @entity189 was finally awarded the @entity192 earlier this month for his bravery in battle			0
he 'd been recommended for it by his unit , but somehow the recommendation was overlooked			0
president @entity198 presented the medal to @entity188 on may 16			0
" i 've never stopped thinking about him , " she said of her late husband			0
" my heart is filled with pride that you ca n't even imagine			0
it 's a terrible double - edged sword , memory is			0
at its best , it fills us with tenderness ; at its worst , it racks us with grief			0
and when it comes to the fallen , it 's hard to face the blade			0
but some people , we should recall , do n't have a choice			0
" the thing about remembering , " wrote @entity217 in " @entity219 , " " is that you do n't forget			0

this *holiday* was established in the 1860s to honor @entity48 dead
for those who have lost loved ones , the day cuts deeply
on @entity46 , we should remember those who gave their lives -- and those left behind
