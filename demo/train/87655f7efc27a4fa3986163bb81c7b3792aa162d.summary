-- while @entity3 is seriously cracking down on the exchange of virtual currencies for real cash , virtual economies backed by newfound legitimacy elsewhere are quickly gaining ground in the real world			2
there 's gold in them there screens : real - money transactions in virtual worlds are finding new legitimacy			1
on june 24 , 2009 , the role - playing game @entity18 launched on @entity19 , following in the footsteps of highly lucrative games @entity16 on @entity22 ( and now @entity23 ) to link virtual - currency exchanges to real - money transactions			1
in march 2009 , @entity25 -- creator of the @entity27 ( massively multiplayer online role - playing game ) @entity29 , where one player famously bought an island for us $ 26,500 in 2004 -- saw its wholly owned subsidiary @entity32 granted a banking license from the @entity34			1
the new license allows @entity32 to be the first bank to directly incorporate real - money transactions with virtual - world activities			1
selling virtual assets directly between players for real - world cash has been strictly prohibited by most game publishers , which find themselves looped out of the profits			1
what has been profitable in the meantime to some hardcore players of @entity45 and @entity46 ( and other games ) is " gold farming " -- accumulation of " gold , " weapons and other status symbols of a seasoned player -- followed by the online auction of such assets or user accounts			0
since games publishers began policing @entity60 for this type of unauthorized activity , several web sites such as @entity58 have adopted a @entity64 - like approach in order to broker the trading legally , acting as an open marketplace for player - to - player exchange of digital assets			0
dual - currency economies however younger games ( often aimed at younger audiences ) are ditching the conventional subscription - based model of the above games to adopt the " freemium " model , which lets users play for free , but allows them to enhance their experience by purchasing accessories or other premiums through micropayments			1
@entity82 , a " @entity84 game for girls " , is one game that has adopted this model			0
ceo @entity88 explains : " the idea with dual currencies is that there is a paid currency [ @entity92 ] , which is paid for using real money and exchanged between sellers and buyers			1
in addition , there is a second currency -- a free or so - called ' earned ' currency [ @entity99 ] -- which is gained through activity and progression in the world or game			2
" " in this way , " he continues , " the economy can recognize different forms of contribution , and in newer economies these can also be traded between each other			0
for example , people earning currency and selling it to people who have less time but have real money			1
" mirrored economies as one of the first successful virtual economies , @entity118 's huge marketplace includes objects and services for sale , as well as a real estate market			2
in 2008 , more than $ 100 million worth of the world 's @entity125 were bought and sold on @entity118 's official @entity128 exchange , according to its web site			2
" in @entity139 , the @entity137 dollar part of the transaction is via @entity64 , a well - known entity , so there 's a certain amount of trust that comes with it , " says @entity130 , co-founder of @entity131 , a two - man freelance venture that sells virtual dog pets and avatars to @entity118 residents			2
recently , however , business has slumped along with the real - world recession			1
" we 'll continue to see a proliferation of alternative currencies associated with specific platforms and communities , much as frequent - flier miles are associated with individual airlines or even networks of airlines , " says @entity146 , ceo of @entity147 , which specializes in creating branded , copyrighted material for virtual worlds			0
" in the longer term we may see a global standard for virtual currencies , but it will take some time			0
" golden e-currency ? @entity163 , chairman of digital - gold company @entity164 , agrees			0
" but , " he adds , " inevitably digital gold currency will make significant inroads in global commerce because it lowers the cost of transacting with one another			1
reducing transaction costs creates more opportunities for global commerce			0
" in march 2009 , @entity164 launched a dedicated @entity23 application allowing its account holders to exchange gold and silver units within minutes			0
putting a trendy @entity23 application that allows people to manage their own digital gold on par with other popular banking applications branded by well - established banks brings e-currency a step closer to the modern mobile end - user			1
furthermore , @entity164 is firmly anchored to real - world assets and individuals , notably strictly forbidding anonymous accounts -- unlike the former incarnation of the pioneering company @entity189 , whose founder this month ends his six - month house arrest in @entity193 after pleading guilty to money laundering - related crimes			1
so how realistic is the prospect of a single , global , digital currency ? " it all comes down to trust , " says senior economist @entity198			0
" we trust the government to guarantee our ' virtual ' money for real currency			2
[ with digital gold ] the gold standard is guaranteed by a private company			0
governments already have several hundred years of sovereignty engrained in people 's minds , so that trust is very difficult to establish			0

@entity29 's @entity32 has been granted a real - money banking license
dual - currency economy allows for free trading between virtual and real money
@entity118 can be profitable , but also suffers from real - world recession
digital gold currency may be promising , but still lacks trust of people
