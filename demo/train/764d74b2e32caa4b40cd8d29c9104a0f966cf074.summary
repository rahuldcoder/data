the budget deficit , the debt ceiling , and tax reform are givens			0
we know that those battles will continue to be in the political spotlight throughout 2013			0
but what else will be front and center in the @entity11 ? by the @entity12 : politics in 2013 here are five other things to keep your eyes on : 1			0
gun control : the shootings in @entity19 , @entity20 , have moved gun control to the top of the " to do " list for the @entity24 and many in @entity26			1
while past mass killings have stirred talk of gun control , the killing of 20 young children and six adults at @entity30 by a man armed with a semi-automatic rifle seems to have changed public opinion			1
" a discussion has reemerged as to what we might do not only to deter mass mass shootings in the future but to reduce the epidemic of gun violence that plagues this country every single day and it 's encouraging that people of all different backgrounds and beliefs and political persuasions have been willing to challenge some old assumptions and change long - standing positions			1
that conversation has to continue but this time , the words need to lead to action , " said the president , vowing to take action			2
@entity56 : proposals to address gun violence due by january the president tapped vice president @entity60 to head a task force to report back in a month on ways to prevent future mass shootings			1
" this is not some @entity0 commission			0
this is not something where folks are gon na be studying the issue for six months and publishing a report that gets read and then pushed aside			0
this is a team that has a very specific task to pull together real reforms right now , " added the president			0
@entity56 : ' something fundamental in @entity77 has to change ' while there 's action @entity56 can take through executive orders , the big question centers on what @entity26 will do and whether lawmakers will buck the @entity84 and push through new gun control measures early in 2013			1
immigration reform : it may take a slight back seat due to the elementary school shootings and the new emphasis by the @entity24 on gun control , but add illegal immigration reform to @entity56 's " to do " list in 2013			1
at a news conference in november soon after his re-election , the president said that he expected an immigration reform bill would be introduced soon after his inauguration , adding that " we need to seize the moment			1
" five reasons why time may be right for immigration reform @entity56 told reporters that he hoped for a comprehensive bill that would include border security , enforcement measures for companies that employ undocumented workers , and resolving the status of the 11 million illegal immigrants living in the @entity77			1
" i am very confident we can get immigration reform done , " added the president			1
and this time around , he may have support from some @entity116 lawmakers , who acknowledge that after their crushing defeat by the president among @entity121 voters in the november election ( national exit polls indicate the president captured more than 70 % of the @entity121 vote ) , it 's time for the @entity116 to consider compromise on the issue of immigration reform			1
future of the @entity116 : as @entity116 try to rebound from a disappointing 2012 election , where they failed to pick up the @entity24 or win back the @entity128 , there seem to be two game plans			1
some in the @entity116 have called for a " bigger tent " party that would be more representative and inclusive of the changing demographics of @entity77 voters			1
others say moderating is the wrong way to go , and that the party needs to stay true to its conservative roots			0
how this discussion plays out in 2013 and beyond will be fascinating to watch			0
opinion : what the tea party cost the @entity116 short term , keep your eyes on the @entity145 as it completes its comprehensive look at what went right , wrong , and what to fix			1
" in order to get back in the game , you 've got to look at and do a full autopsy of what happened , " @entity145 chairman @entity149 told @entity1 about a month ago			0
we could see some recommendations from the report start to surface in late january , when the party committee holds its annual meeting in @entity159			0
campaign politics : who says there 's no real action on the campaign trail the year after a presidential election ? we 've always got gubernatorial elections to watch in @entity167 and @entity168 the year after the race for the @entity24			1
and both should be very interesting this time			0
@entity168 is shaping up to be a battle between @entity116 attorney general @entity172 , a tea party - backed and controversial conservative , and @entity175 , the often outspoken former chairman of the @entity176			1
the @entity167 race may not be as riveting now that @entity180 's @entity179 mayor @entity178 decided against a bid			2
but the fact that the @entity116 candidate is the tough talking popular governor , @entity183 , means that we 'll have a full year of watching him on the campaign trail and a full year to wonder if his re-election bid is just a warm up act for a 2016 attempt at higher office			2
two high - profile governors races ensure 2013 wo n't be quiet year but wait , there 's more			2
thanks to the president 's nomination of sen. @entity197 of @entity198 to succeed @entity199 as secretary of state , it looks like we 'll have a special election in june 2013 to fill the final year and a half of @entity197 's term			2
and that could give outgoing @entity116 sen. @entity205 , who was just defeated in the november election , a chance to return to the @entity128			2
meanwhile , three @entity179 congressmen are already making moves to run for @entity197 's seat			2
all the action up in @entity212 will draw national attention			0
@entity214 picks up major support for @entity128 bid , including from @entity197 if that 's not enough , we already have three special elections in 2013 to fill vacant @entity24 seats			1
the race for 2016 : call this the pre pre-season			0
while it may seem absurd to many people that we are already talking about the next presidential contest when the 2012 election is barely in our rear view mirror , this is the world we live in			0
so get used to it			0
@entity199 has n't even stepped down yet as secretary of state and there 's already constant speculation as to whether she 'll run again for the @entity24			2
while no decision from her on any future bid for president is expected in 2013 , expect speculation about her future political plans to intensify throughout the new year			0
opinion : for 2016 , @entity245 vs. @entity243 same thing , on a lower level , for vice president @entity60			0
on the @entity116 side , we 're already starting to look at sen. @entity250 of @entity251 , rep. @entity252 of @entity253 , gov. @entity254 of @entity255 , sen. @entity256 of @entity257 , former gov. @entity245 of @entity251 , former @entity116 presidential candidate @entity258 of @entity259 , and @entity183 , through the 2016 prism			2
in reality , with the real start of the 2016 campaign still about two years away , now 's the time for these possible candidates to make speeches , meet and greet donors , campaign for fellow @entity116 in the 2013 and 2014 elections , and write books			1
and we 'll be here to cover it all .			0
