@entity0 , @entity1 -- twenty - five years ago , when tanks and automatic rifles silenced massive political demonstrations in @entity0 's @entity7 , i was @entity8 's correspondent in @entity1			1
for me , memories of the crackdown start in the early evening of june 3 , and end with a mad dash at the wheel of a @entity14 sedan , driving through checkpoints to a safe house with hunger strikers , @entity18 and @entity19			1
@entity18 , one of @entity1 's prominent intellectuals and writers , was imprisoned four times after the @entity7 crackdown , and in 2010 was awarded the @entity24			1
@entity19 is a singer - composer , better known in @entity1 as composer of the " @entity26 , " a patriotic tune popular in @entity28 and the mainland			1
a few years before the crackdown , he " defected " from @entity28 and became a celebrated compatriot on the mainland			2
tension builds in the early evening of june 3 , as word spread that the authorities were losing patience with protesters in central @entity0 , i decided to see for myself what was going on			1
as i stepped off the curb on the @entity40 bridge , i saw a convoy of army trucks stranded on the bridge , about five kilometers east of @entity7			1
students and their supporters milled around them , chanting " xia lai ! @entity47 lai ! " ( come down ! )			2
minutes earlier , an armoured personnel carrier of the @entity49 ( @entity49 ) plowed through the crowd and rammed one of their own army trucks bound for @entity7			1
many civilians had clambered onto the truck when it was hit and toppled over			0
some managed to jump off , but one man was crushed to death			0
" they 're killing us , " shrieked a young woman			0
nearby i saw civilians surround another army truck , pleading with the soldiers to turn around and go home			1
the young soldiers listened silently			2
then the civilians started to pull the soldiers off the truck and led them past the body of a man curled up on a pool of blood , his head crushed			2
this harrowing scene was captured on the cover of @entity8 's june 12 edition			1
i hung around for an hour or so , talking to people and eavesdropping on conversations			2
then , worried that the @entity1 authorities might cut international phone service , i returned to my apartment to file my story			0
it was nearly midnight when i hit the " send " button			0
final showdown to come i thought it was the lead story of the day			0
i did not realize that the fiercest shooting was taking place at @entity92 , around seven kilometers west of the @entity7 , where thousands of people had stood behind the barricades at various intersections to halt the advance of the military troops			1
in the morning of june 3 , i sat down with two fellow @entity8 reporters who had been covering the @entity7 story from the outset			1
we agreed that the final showdown between the protesters and soldiers was looming			2
martial law remained in place , and troops and tanks were poised to retake the @entity7			1
when and how it would happen , we could not tell			0
to ensure that we covered what seemed like the end - game of the protracted student protests , we agreed to do two things : 1			0
we would work on three " shifts " through the next day ( i volunteered to do the midnight - to - dawn " graveyard shift " ) and 2			0
we would file reports via our snail - paced modems as soon as possible , in case international phone links were abruptly cut off			0
just past midnight on sunday , june 4 , 1989 , i was preparing to rush to @entity7 to do my reportorial " shift			1
" the phone rang and i grabbed it as i slung my satchel bag over my shoulder			0
it was an @entity125 friend , a well - connected expatriate company manager married to the daughter of a retired @entity1 general			0
" be careful , @entity129 , " he advised			0
" heard the assault order has just been given			0
" i thanked him for the tip. not long after i hung up , the phone rang again			0
it was @entity135 , @entity8 's @entity0 bureau chief , calling from the vicinity of the @entity7			1
i was supposed to relieve her for the graveyard shift			0
" they 're shooting live bullets here , " she said urgently			0
" do n't come here anymore			0
phone @entity141 and tell editors what 's going on			2
" it was saturday noon , @entity141 time , and i knew the latest weekly edition was about to go to press			0
i frantically dialed @entity141 and promptly reached a top editor			0
" we 're switching covers , " he said decisively			0
" you guys have seven hours to file			0
stay out of the firing line			0
remember , no story is worth dying for , " he said calmly			0
the @entity8 cover story that week told the horrific account of that fateful night			1
since then , the @entity7 story has been told and retold countless times all over the world with that day 's harrowing tales and bloody images			1
race to a safe house of course , the story did n't end there , though the lead article had gone to print			1
i drove to the @entity8 office to file more reports from @entity8 reporters and photographers			1
remarkably , international phone lines remained open despite occasional threats to close them			0
still , the bureau 's two computers and one telephone modem were agonizingly slow			2
i tuned in local radio stations to monitor official news reports and commentaries , and started phoning sources			0
a septuagenarian @entity0 resident told me : " i 've seen @entity188 , i saw the communist occupation of @entity0 in 1949 , but i 've never seen such a pili pala ( hail of gunshots ) ! " i banged away at the bureau computer until nearly noon			1
with the story filed and the magazine put the " bed , " i was preparing to leave the bureau when the phone rang			2
a female caller wondered if i could drive over to the @entity196 to pick up my friend @entity19 so he could go to a safe house			1
she made it sound so easy			0
in late may , just as the @entity7 protests were petering out , @entity19 and three young @entity1 intellectuals , led another round of " hunger strike " on the @entity7 and gave a boost to the sagging student movement			1
when the @entity49 troops encircled the @entity7 in the early morning of june 4 , @entity19 helped broker the agreement with the army officers to open a corridor for the protesters to leave the @entity7 safely			1
from the @entity7 , it turned out , @entity19 took refuge in the @entity0 hospital not far from the @entity7			1
could i help ? i hesitated but then agreed			0
i drove past carcasses of trucks and debris from the barricades along the virtually empty streets			2
only helmeted @entity49 soldiers brandishing ak - 47s stood stiffly at every other corner			2
as i pulled in front of the @entity196 , @entity224 and two other fellow hunger - strike leaders emerged from the gate and jumped into my car			2
on our way toward the safe - house , we stumbled into a group of @entity49 troops in one intersection			1
" shall i proceed ? " i ask the trio			0
" yes , " replied @entity18			1
" no other choice , " @entity19 agreed			1
we drove past the checkpoint and made it to their destination			2
once inside the safe house , i was rewarded with three separate debriefings and eyewitness accounts of what happened on the @entity7 when the @entity49 came to clear it			1
months later , @entity19 gave me the ultimate compliment by sending a cassette tape of his latest songs			1
on the cover , he scribbled : " to the bravest driver in @entity0			2
