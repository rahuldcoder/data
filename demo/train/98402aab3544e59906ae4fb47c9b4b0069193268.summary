-- the discovery of @entity2 , a breakthrough in the treatment of bipolar disorder , the advent of the contraceptive pill ... @entity0 looks at some of the scientific discoveries that changed the world			1
@entity2 was isolated by scientists in 1983 and named in 1986 by an international committee the discovery of hiv / aids originally called slimmer 's disease , as sufferers lost a lot of weight , the first recorded case of @entity2 occurred in the @entity20 in 1977			1
after several infections , a @entity22 doctor died of pneumonia , which normally does n't break through the body 's immune system			2
the components of her disease had not yet been placed together , indicating that this was a new form of illness			0
other cases spread in following years around @entity32 and in homosexual men in @entity34 and @entity35			0
by 1980 , 55 @entity37 men had been diagnosed with the disease			0
@entity39 began in @entity40 , the @entity37 and @entity32 to ascertain what this new disease could be			0
the @entity43 found that the disease was caused by a virus being passed around by bodily fluids such as semen or blood			0
in 1981 it published its findings , saying the disease attacked t - cells , which help the body fight infection			2
by 1983 the disease was isolated by teams of @entity37 and @entity58 researchers			1
in 1986 an international committee decided the virus should be called human immunodeficiency virus ( @entity2 )			1
education campaigns were unrolled around the world , advising people to avoid risky sexual behavior or sharing needles			0
by june 1990 , 139,765 people had the disease , with a 60 per cent mortality rate			0
the progress of the disease slowed down in the @entity72 with education campaigns and the development of protease inhibitors , which provided sufferers with almost complete remission			1
but in @entity32 , the spread and treatment of @entity2 remains a global concern			1
the discovery of lithium to treat mood disorders @entity85 psychiatrist @entity84 once said , " i believe the brain , like any other organ , can get sick and it can also heal			1
" he made huge gains in healing the brain through his work with sufferers of bipolar disorder by discovering that lithium salts -- a naturally occurring chemical - could be used to treat the illness			1
previously , electro - convulsive therapy and lobotomies had been the major treatments for bipolar disorder			1
after having been a prisoner of war in @entity100 , dr. @entity84 served as the head of the @entity102 in @entity103			0
it was at an unused kitchen in @entity106 where he conducted crude experiments that led to the discovery of lithium as a treatment of bipolar disorder			1
after trials on humans , dr. @entity84 speculated that bipolar disorder was a " lithium deficiency disease " and that a dose of lithium had a calming effect			1
dr. @entity84 published findings in the @entity117 in 1949 entitled " lithium salts in the treatment of psychotic excitement			1
" he died in 1980			0
lithium is still used successfully in the treatment of mental illness to this day			2
the discovery of @entity125 @entity127 @entity126 was known as the " father of micro-biology			1
" he drew scientific attention to the many bacteria that he discovered			2
his research was helped by the different types of microscopes that he developed over his lifetime			0
from his powerful lenses he was able to ascertain many different types of lifeforms too small for the human eye to see			0
it was by observing the build - up of plaque on teeth that the @entity127 scientist discovered what we now know to be bacteria			1
his initial observations on bacteria make for amusing reading			2
on september 17 , 1683 , @entity126 wrote to the @entity151 about the plaque between his own teeth , " a little white matter , which is as thick as if ' twere batter			1
" he then observed two women and two old men who had never cleaned their teeth in their lives			2
looking at these samples with his microscope , @entity126 wrote of " an unbelievably great company of living animalcules , a-swimming more nimbly than any i had ever seen up to this time			2
the biggest sort ... bent their body into curves in going forwards ... moreover , the other animalcules were in such enormous numbers , that all the water ... seemed to be alive			0
" he also observed algae on water surfaces and the furry coating on human and animal tongues during illness , bringing his theories to the attention of the @entity151			0
most bacteria are harmless , although some bacterial diseases are fatal : tuberculosis kills about 2 million people a year			2
bacteria are important in the production of cheese and yogurt , in processing wastewater and in manufacturing antibiotics			2
the contraceptive pill the oral contraceptive commonly known as " the pill " was invented during the 1950s in @entity195 , @entity196			0
it contains hormone - like substances , usually estrogen and progestin , that enter the blood stream and disrupt the production of ova and ovulation , with the aim of preventing pregnancy			0
it originated after an unexpected discovery made in a jungle in @entity210 in the 1930s			0
while professor @entity213 was experimenting with plant steroids , he discovered a chemical process that transformed these steroids into the female sex hormone , progesterone			1
researchers in the late 1940s began to explore the possibility of an inexpensive oral contraceptive			0
chemist @entity222 tested a derivative from @entity213 's findings on 1,308 volunteers in @entity226 in 1958 and @entity227 applied for @entity229 approval to market the drug			1
the pill came on to the market in the @entity37 in 1960 and is still widely used today			0

@entity2 was isolated in 1983 and can be controlled with protease inhibitors
psychiatrist @entity238 *pioneered* lithium as a treatment for bipolar disorder
@entity127 @entity126 discovered bacteria as a build - up on teeth
professor @entity213 's experiments with plant steroids led to the @entity249
