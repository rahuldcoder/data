-- i was born in @entity4 , @entity5 , in 1964 , the year @entity2 was awarded the @entity6 , the @entity1 was passed in the @entity7 , and @entity8 was sentenced to life in prison			1
mine was a relatively idyllic childhood in the affluent and segregated northern suburbs of @entity4			0
like many white @entity5 , i lived in an ignorant cocoon of privilege , with no idea that having two live - in maids , a full - time gardener and a driver was unusual			1
it was perfectly normal for my @entity5 nannies , @entity22 and @entity23 , to live with us rather than with their own children , and there was no need to learn their language or even their last names			1
it was only as a teenager that i began to realize something was horribly wrong			0
@entity35 and i were walking along the road of our pristine " whites only " neighborhood when we saw a police van stop			2
two armed white police officers got out and began interrogating the black passers by			0
they roughly shoved several of them into their van , screaming obscenities all the time			2
i was terrified and asked @entity35 what was going on			0
she explained that the police were on a " pass " raid , and any black person in a white suburb without an identity book stamped with official permission to live and work in @entity4 was a criminal and liable to arrest			0
from that day on i was no longer innocent to the evils of apartheid			2
a teacher in my segregated public elementary believed in schooling her privileged white students in the injustices happening all around them			0
suddenly @entity35 and @entity22 became real people to me , and i learned for the first time about @entity8 and the @entity65			1
songs like " @entity67 " became part of our consciousness , but @entity8 himself was still a mythical figure : the blanket of @entity5 government censorship , which made it a crime to publish the words of prohibited leaders and organizations , or to write about the @entity80 or prison conditions , kept us in relative ignorance			1
the @entity85 riots happened on june 16 , 1976			0
police shot into huge crowds of schoolchildren of all ages protesting a directive they could not be taught in their own language			0
hundreds of people were killed ; the cruelty and brutality of the government 's reaction was met with rioting that spread to other townships			2
it was the beginning of the end of colonial , racist @entity5			1
the shooting death of 13 - year - old @entity102 galvanized the world			0
yet we knew little about it , even though @entity85 was less than 20 miles away			0
in high school , history teacher mr. @entity106 , who had been arrested several times for anti-apartheid activism , insisted we wear black armbands every june 16th			0
but it was only in april 1994 , in my late 20s and standing for hours in a long line of black and white @entity5 to vote in the country 's first democratic election , that i came close to truly understanding the unforgivable nature of apartheid			1
next to me was a dignified 75 - year - old man who had taken two buses and walked 10 miles to the voting station to vote for the first time in his life			1
on my other side was @entity124 , the lady who was helping raise my children , and who had become an integral part of our lives			0
only now , at the age of 55 , was she considered a real citizen in the place where she and her ancestors had lived for hundreds of years			2
we whites had lived in a place that denied people their basic human rights			2
why had it taken so long to change this inhumane system ? how had we allowed it ? i stood in that line experiencing a mixture of jubilation and guilt			0
had i really lived for 29 years in a country that had denied the majority of its people the right to vote ? it was also a time to truly appreciate the enormous sacrifice and achievement of @entity8 and his comrades			1
@entity8 's release from prison in february 1990 had been both a highly anticipated and enormously feared event			1
many members of the white @entity5 minority were terrified of the kind of displacement and retribution that has historically followed revolutions and major changes in government			1
so you can imagine everyone 's relief when , rather than calling for a revolution , @entity8 instead preached reconciliation , and spoke of a @entity169 and the importance of @entity171 -- we are human through the humanity of others			1
it was then that the brilliance of @entity8 as a peacemaker , a politician and a statesman emerged			1
to really understand the psyche of @entity8 is to grasp his profound lack of bitterness , a quality that is almost inhuman for a man who spent 27 years as a prisoner of the @entity5 government			1
it seems @entity8 consciously cultivated that quality			1
he wrote : " as i walked out the door toward the gate that would lead to my freedom , i knew if i did n't leave my bitterness and hatred behind , i 'd still be in prison			1
" as chronicled in the @entity197 movie " @entity198 , " this is a man who donned a green rugby jersey during the @entity201 in 1995 to send a message to racist white @entity5 rugby players and fans that everyone in the " @entity169 " of the new @entity5 would be rooting for their victory			1
this is a man who in 1995 visited @entity209 , the 94 - year - old widow of one of the prime architects of apartheid , and a man who invited his white jailor as a vip guest to his inauguration as the country 's first black president			2
i first met @entity8 at a business awards gathering			2
the second time was at the opening of the @entity224 in @entity225 where he presided as guest of honor			0
he was charming , talking to me about my job while holding my hand			0
he was still extremely energetic at 79 and very handsome			0
his only ailment was watery eyes , the result of 13 years spent doing hard labor at the limestone quarry on @entity234 , where he spent 18 years of his 27 years of imprisonment in a small cell			1
i also met the president at the @entity238 in @entity4 when he greeted the @entity240 soccer team , who were visiting @entity5			2
it was amazing to see these superstar athletes awestruck at being in the presence of the most famous politician of this generation			0
it was 1997 , and the transformation of the country 's psyche was palpable			0
we were no longer the pariahs of the world , and suddenly @entity8 had lifted @entity5 from disgrace to worldwide acceptance and applause			1
he had done so gracefully and relatively peacefully			0
that is probably why nearly everyone introduced to @entity8 would tear up , so moved were they by his stature and accomplishments			2
his daughters @entity263 and @entity264 and their mother @entity265 were exiled to @entity266 , a town hundreds of miles away from @entity4			0
they grew up without their father , sleeping on the floor			0
@entity8 lost three of his six children , one of whom died while he was in prison			1
in june of 2010 , his beloved great - granddaughter @entity274 was killed in a car accident at the start of the @entity277			0
now , at 94 , nearly 95 , like most mortals in their twilight years , @entity8 is frail , and in the hospital yet again , in serious condition			1
all this is not to say that @entity8 's emphasis on facilitating a peaceful transition of power in @entity5 has not been criticized			1
many believed , and still do , that @entity8 was too conciliatory and that too little was done to transform the @entity5 economy			1
indeed , to a large extent , economic power still remains mainly in the hands of whites and a small black elite			0
the country is grappling with enormous problems , including high unemployment and growing corruption			0
indeed , the new @entity5 that owes its relative peace and prosperity to the transformative vision of @entity8 is still a work in progress			1
but , whatever the future brings for the @entity169 , @entity8 will always be the man who turned a nightmare into a vision , a vision into a dream and a dream into a reality			2
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity310 .			2

@entity310 grew up in a cocoon of privilege in @entity5 , *unaware* of apartheid
voting with blacks and whites for the first time , she appreciated what @entity8 did
@entity310 : his release from prison was highly anticipated and enormously feared
@entity310 : @entity8 's profound lack of bitterness after 27 years of prison *informed* his life
