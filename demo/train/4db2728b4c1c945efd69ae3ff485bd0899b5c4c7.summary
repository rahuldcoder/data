-- gunfire and explosions echo in the background as the 26 year - old fighter calmly adjusts his weapons			1
the sounds of war , once terrifying and alien , are now utterly familiar to the young man who goes by the pseudonym @entity10			0
" i used to demonstrate peacefully , " @entity10 recalls			0
" i joined the @entity11 after my brother was killed "			0
staring out the window with his weapon ready , he surveys the street below and the war scarred buildings across the road as he continues to tell his brother 's story			0
" my brother defected from the @entity22 army			1
he defected because he was told to kill innocent civilians and given orders to shoot at demonstrators , " says @entity10			0
@entity10 says his brother was killed defending the same neighborhood he is now trying to protect			0
" this is his gun , this is my martyr brother 's gun , " @entity10 says , gesturing at his @entity29 assault rifle			1
" i am following in his footsteps to protect the people			0
" @entity35 is part of a rebel fighting force that says it is protecting the neighborhood of @entity39 in the flashpoint city of @entity41			1
this particular frontline is @entity43 , which separates the opposition stronghold from @entity45 , which is held by @entity22 president @entity47 's government forces			1
your take : should the @entity49 intervene in @entity22 ? clashes between both sides have rendered the once - bustling middle class shopping street into a combat wasteland			1
piles of rubble and burnt out vehicles form makeshift fighting positions			1
debris covers the road and sidewalk , buildings are pock - marked with bullet and shrapnel holes , and shredded store awnings flap feebly in the breeze			1
@entity66 seems deserted , but the fighters of the @entity11 here say it 's not just about defending residents who remain -- it 's also about defending the property of those who have left			0
the rebels claim that @entity47 loyalists would steal or destroy anything they can get their hands on , accusing them of ransacking and shooting up homes of anyone they suspect of speaking out against the government			1
the local rebel commander , who goes by @entity81 , crawls through holes fighters smashed between buildings to be able to stealthily move around			0
@entity22 government forces are just across the road			1
shouldering a @entity89 - made @entity88 sniper rifle , he greets some of his men in the staircase			2
the crude fighting position is inside one of the rooms			2
a hole in the wall is covered by a slab of metal with a slit that @entity81 points his weapon through			0
one of his men tells him to look to the left , to the balcony			0
" is it where the red and blue towels are ? " @entity81 asks -- and then , having spotted the target , the 32 - year - old fires			2
down the road at another battle position , @entity110 has his enemy in sight			2
he opens fire with his machine gun			2
the response from the government forces is immediate and intense			2
" give me the radio , give me the radio , " @entity119 calls out as a hail of bullets from government forces drowns out his orders			2
suddenly movement is spotted to the left			0
" there is it , there it is ! " someone shouts			0
an armored police personnel carrier ( @entity133 ) creeps into the alleyway , unleashing a deafening volley of bullets from its .50 - caliber machine gun			1
a rebel voice mocks the notion of a ceasefire : " @entity141 , this is @entity142 , @entity41 , " he says as the @entity133 moves back and fires directly at the rebel fighting position			1
@entity145 , another machine gunner , says indignantly : " we ca n't just have a one - sided ceasefire -- they ca n't expect us to come under fire and not respond			0
" so far any attempts at diplomacy and dialogue between the @entity47 government and the opposition have failed			0
a growing number of civilians are joining the armed struggle , believing it is their only chance after having paid a bitter price these last 15 months for daring to defy the regime			1
the men fighting on @entity43 -- and many others fighting across the country -- say they will carry on until the bitter end , even if it means the uprising becomes a civil war .			1
