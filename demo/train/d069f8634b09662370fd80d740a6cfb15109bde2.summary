-- amidst all the shouting over tuesday 's transfer of the @entity3 to @entity5 control , a distinct cry of pain could be heard for the loss of one voice -- representative @entity10 ( @entity11 )			1
@entity5 @entity12 , majority leader of @entity14 's @entity13 , has taken @entity10 's seat			1
as chair of the influential subcommittee on the internet of the @entity22 , @entity10 's imprint on tech issues -- particularly online privacy -- was clear as a bell			1
" tonight the @entity27 has lost one of its most intelligent and tech - saavy members , " a press statement from @entity25 of @entity26 declared late tuesday			1
" @entity10 has been one of the most moderate and thoughtful voices on communications and intellectual property policy			2
" a long shadow earlier this year , @entity10 proposed a bill that would bar companies from using a cell phone 's geolocation information without a consumer 's consent			1
ditto for content on race , religious beliefs , or sexual orientation			0
for most other information , a simple opt - out would keep data from being used by first - or third - party vendors			0
many of @entity10 's @entity21 policy oriented @entity52 colleagues survived this election			1
these would include pro-net neutrality stalwart @entity54 ( @entity55 ) as well as @entity56 ( @entity57 ) , who unsuccessfully tried to push a compromise open internet bill through @entity27 last month			1
other @entity52 survivors include @entity60 ( @entity57 ) , who launched bills against loud television commercials and for automatic fiber conduits included in every road construction project			0
meet the replacements but in the next @entity27 these democrats will sit on the minority side of the aisle			2
the big @entity5 voices that will replace them on the @entity22 have been very vocal on communications technology issues			0
they include former committee chair @entity72 ( @entity74 ) , who ultimately refused to go along with @entity56 's net neutrality compromise , @entity76 ( @entity77 ) , and @entity78 ( @entity79 )			1
the latter takes particular interest in mobile phone and wireless spectrum concerns			0
still , despite all the " no compromise " rhetoric that 's flying about , there may be some continuity in various policy areas -- particularly regarding online privacy			2
in early october , @entity72 and @entity54 sent a long list of tough questions to @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 and other companies about their web privacy policies , particularly as they related to cookies and data retention			0
@entity72 has just released a statement in response to @entity92 's answers			0
" it 's good that @entity92 was in a hurry to respond to our concerns , but the fact remains that some third - party applications were knowingly transferring personal information in direct violation of @entity92 's privacy promises to its users , " he warned			2
" i want the internet economy to prosper , but it ca n't unless the people 's right to privacy means more than a right to hear excuses after the damage is done			0
in the next @entity27 , the @entity22 and our subcommittees are going to put internet privacy policies in the crosshairs			2
" a privacy bill on the way ? and there will have to be some concurrence with the democrats on these hot - button questions , because they 've retained control over the @entity131			0
that means that @entity134 chair @entity133 ( @entity135 ) will remain a critical voice on web - related concerns on that side of the aisle -- @entity133 warned just last week that he may submit a privacy bill to @entity27 himself			1
so while the partisan rhetoric may fly on questions like net neutrality , various forms of consensus may also surface on occasion , particularly in areas like online privacy and getting more spectrum licenses to the wireless industry			1
it all depends on who winds up where in the next @entity153			0

@entity12 , majority leader of @entity14 's @entity13 , took @entity10 's seat
@entity25 : " tonight the @entity27 has lost one of its most intelligent and tech - saavy members "
partisan rhetoric may fly on questions like net neutrality
