-- @entity2 police investigating abuse claims against disgraced tv host @entity4 arrested a @entity6 man sunday on suspicion of sexual offenses			1
police did not release the suspect 's name , but said the man they arrested falls under the " @entity14 and others " strand of their investigation			1
the man was later released on bail			0
@entity2 media reported that the man arrested was 1970s pop star @entity18			1
a tv documentary a month ago detailed allegations of sexual abuse against @entity22			1
police investigating the scandal are dealing with about 300 apparent victims , @entity26			0
@entity4 's favored targets were apparently girls in their mid-teens in what @entity27 said was " alleged abuse on an unprecedented scale			1
" the @entity2 tv icon died in october 2011 at age 84			0
but authorities have said they are preparing an arrest strategy for others , still living , against whom allegations have been made in connection with the @entity4 case			2
profile : idolized in life , reviled in death countless @entity2 who grew up watching @entity22 on tv 's " @entity46 " and his children 's program " @entity51 " have been left reeling by the slew of claims against him in the past month			1
the reputation of the @entity58 , his former employer , has also been tainted by the scandal amid questions over how his abuse went undetected , and its decision to drop a program investigating allegations him last year			2
" now the @entity58 risks squandering public trust because one of its stars over three decades was apparently a sexual criminal ; because he used his programme and popularity as a cover for his wickedness ; because he used @entity58 premises for some of his attacks ; and because others -- @entity58 employees and hangers - on -- may also have been involved , " @entity58 chairman @entity81 wrote in an editorial published sunday in the @entity83			0
the @entity58 has said it is horrified by the revelations and has launched two independent inquiries			0
how scandal has rocked @entity58 sunday 's arrest comes a day after @entity4 's family made its first public statement since a slew of claims of sexual abuse of under - age girls destroyed the reputation of a man they had regarded as a hero			1
@entity4 's nephew , @entity100 , had defended his late uncle -- who hosted shows watched and heard by a generation of young @entity2 -- in a newspaper interview before the allegations emerged in a tv documentary a month ago			1
but as those few claims snowballed into hundreds , the family had to face up to the horrific truth : that the man they were so proud of as a media star and tireless charity fundraiser had a far darker side to his past			2
" i watched the program in horror and could not believe that these allegations were about our uncle			2
this was n't the man we knew and loved , " @entity100 said			0
" we began to have doubts as to our own feeling towards our uncle			0
how could the person we thought we knew and loved do such a thing ? " why would a man who raised so much money for charity , who gave so much of his own time and energy for others risk it all doing indecent criminal acts ? how could anyone live their life doing the ' most good and most evil ' at the same time ? " @entity0 's @entity140 and @entity141 contributed to this report .			0
