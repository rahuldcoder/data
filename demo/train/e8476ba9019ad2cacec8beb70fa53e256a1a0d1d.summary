-- @entity1 is facing the greatest health care challenges in its history			1
unprecedented demand is a certainty			0
according to the @entity7 on aging and @entity9 statistics , the number of @entity1 65 and older has exploded by a full 6 million in the past decade to over 13 % of the overall population , while the population of " oldest old " -- those 85 and older -- has increased by a factor of 10 from the 1950s to today 's 6 million			1
older people harbor the most disabling diseases , including heart disease , cancer , stroke and dementia : the diseases that depend most on specialist care and complex technology for diagnosis , management and treatment			0
yet the @entity25 administration has wrongheadedly focused on shifting @entity1 to government insurance			2
of the 8.5 million individuals newly insured under @entity28 at the end of the first half of 2014 , more than 6 million were enrolled into @entity31 , based on analysis by @entity33 and @entity34 of @entity35 using @entity31 and @entity37 data			1
after the law 's @entity31 expansion and with the population aging into @entity37 eligibility , the 107 million under @entity31 or @entity37 in 2013 rapidly increases to 135 million just five years later , according to @entity43 projections			1
by the end of the decade , a full 140 million @entity1 will have their health care access directly controlled by the @entity1 government , a growth rate far higher than private insurance			1
the problem is that government insurance does not correspond to access to medical care , nor does it imply good health outcomes			2
@entity31 is already refused by more than half of doctors across @entity1 , according to 2013 data from a 2014 @entity58 survey			2
likewise , more than 20 % of primary care doctors already accept no new @entity37 patients , five times the percentage who refuse new privately insured patients			2
in 2012 alone , @entity43 reported that almost 10,000 doctors opted out of @entity37 , tripling from 2009			0
and , counter to the administration 's demonization of private insurers , it is @entity37 that consistently ranks at the top of the charts for the highest rates of claim refusals , more than nearly all the comparison private insurers every year , according to the @entity76 's 2013 @entity75			2
here is another important reality to consider			0
virtually all patients with serious diseases today are managed by specialists and with advanced technology			0
for seniors , visits to specialists have increased from 37 % of visits two decades ago to 55 % today			0
and that 's appropriate , because those are the doctors who have necessary training and expertise to use the complex diagnostic tests and devices , state - of - the - art procedures , and novel drugs of modern medicine			0
fittingly , @entity1 unambiguously prioritize the latest medical technology			2
surveys by @entity98 / @entity97 demonstrate that 80 % of @entity1 say being able to get the most advanced tests , drugs and medical procedures and equipment is " very important " or " absolutely essential " ; 67 % say that technologies like digital imaging and advances in health information will improve patient care and / or reduce medical costs , while only 10 % think these advances cost more than they are worth			2
in a @entity111 study , @entity1 showed a 50 % higher interest in new medical discoveries than citizens of @entity116 nations			0
we often hear of the @entity118 projected shortage of primary care doctors , but little attention is paid to the fact that almost two - thirds of the 2025 doctor shortage of 124,000 will be in specialists , not in primary care			0
yet this administration has been naively prioritizing generalist care at the expense of specialists			0
the government 's @entity130 already recommended substantial cuts to specialists -- 16.7 % over 3 years and then frozen , equivalent to a 50 % decrease after the decade , considering inflation			0
it is counterproductive to restrict the autonomy and cut salaries of those who we need the most , thereby reducing the job 's attractiveness to the best and brightest who already have a wide range of career choices			0
more directly , @entity28 is eliminating access to many of the best specialists and best hospitals for middle - income @entity1			1
to meet the law 's requirements , major insurers all across the country are declining to participate in the exchanges , or only offering plans that exclude many of @entity1 's best doctors and hospitals			1
@entity160 reported 68 % of @entity28 insurance options only cover narrow or very narrow provider networks , double that of one year ago			0
for cancer care , the overwhelming majority of @entity1 's best hospitals in the @entity165 -- including @entity166 , @entity168 's @entity167 , @entity169 in @entity170 and the @entity171 -- are not covered in most of their states ' exchange plans			1
the " narrow network " strategy is about to hit even more @entity1 in 2015 , as @entity28 exchanges from @entity178 to @entity179 further restrict access to top doctors and hospitals in an attempt to quell insurance premium increases caused by the law itself			1
the fact is that @entity28 transforms @entity1 health care toward an antiquated , generalist system and significantly reduces health care choices that @entity1 hold dear			1
while the president and his @entity195 allies claim that there has been no alternative offered , more than half a dozen @entity192 health care proposals increase choices for families and increase access to the best doctors via competition and individual empowerment			1
voters who prioritize freedom of choice and quality in health care should look to the @entity192 to reset the course of @entity1 's health care system to one that holds true to @entity1 values while advancing access to specialist care and advanced technology .			1

@entity216 : as @entity1 's population ages , millions more qualify for @entity37
he says the @entity28 is putting the majority of newly insured under @entity31
@entity222 : well over 100 million will be covered by government programs that offer less choice
@entity192 health care changes would offer more choice , more access to technology , he says
