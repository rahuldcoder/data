@entity0 , @entity1 -- as she took to the stage , both judges and spectators alike were unsure what the young @entity8 woman would do			1
standing before the mic , dressed head to toe in a soft pink ensemble complete with a matching veil , @entity10 was about to perform in front of an audience for the first time			1
then , a hard - hitting beat began to blare out of the speakers and the 18 - year - old started to rap			0
since her captivating appearance on popular tv talent show " @entity26 " last october , the young veiled hip - hop artist has amassed a huge following for challenging how women in @entity8 are meant to behave			1
her lyrics highlight the importance of girls ' education and denounce sexual harassment of women on the streets of @entity8			1
" it was never about going on stage in a scarf , " says @entity10			1
" it was about going on stage and sharing a message , " she adds			0
" @entity8 women undergo harassment and bullying on a daily basis			1
" award - winning last week @entity10 's inspiring work for women 's rights was recognized at the prestigious @entity49 awards			1
the young singer , who won this year 's arts category , sat down with @entity2 before the ceremony to explain how she is tackling @entity8 's sexual harassment of women head on			1
" these are matters that are very present in @entity8 but no one is talking about them -- they are a big problem in @entity8 society , " she explains			2
" it 's about going out there and explaining your experience and sharing that with others so we know these problems exist and that is the way of changing views			0
" hip - hop as a genre of music is where people have an avenue to express what they feel , the problems they go through ... there is less of an emphasis on the performance itself but rather on what is actually being said			0
" having grown up in a traditionally conservative , patriarchal society , @entity10 's feminist rhymes resonate with many of her fans who encourage her to continue combating gender discrimination through her music			1
she raps in one of songs : " who said that femininity is about dresses ? femininity is about intelligence and intellect			0
" ' i defy that ' women in @entity8 routinely face instances of sexual harassment -- according to a 2008 survey of 1,010 women conducted by the @entity109 for women 's rights , 83 % of @entity8 women and 98 % of foreign women have been sexually harassed			1
@entity10 describes how women can feel self conscious simply for walking to school or work			1
" she 'll get looks and it can degenerate into touching			0
another thing that commonly happens is that a woman can be walking in the street and she could be followed by a car			0
it could also degenerate to people hitting her from within the car or getting out of the car while saying all sorts of things to her			0
" [ these incidents ] do not encourage her to leave her house anymore			0
it supports that idea that a woman should stay at home and not go out and i 'm completely against that			0
" carnival of freedom the rapper , who is also an undergraduate studying politics and social science , also spends much of her time speaking to women who share their stories of daily discrimination with her			2
with their permission , @entity10 then incorporates those experiences into her music			2
" there is a lot of recent interest in women 's rights in @entity8			1
people are more responsive at the moment and are becoming more interested in what i have to say			0
because of this i set up a @entity164 event called " @entity165 " and the whole point is to show or post day - to - day activities that are otherwise considered taboo in @entity8 culture			2
" so for example , [ it could be ] women playing football or going to a cafe , playing pool or eating in the street			0
essentially this is to keep encouraging men and women to be part of this natural need to enjoy one 's self and express one 's self with freedom			1
" for the time being , @entity10 will continue to split her days between university and her passion for rapping			2
she acknowledges that she 's young and is still trying to work out exactly what path to take			2
but she hopes her raps will continue to inspire others to change the way they think and treat others in @entity8 society			2
" one of the strongest messages i 'd like to send is , ' @entity196 is an obligation on others before it becomes my right			0
