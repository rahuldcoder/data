-- with his quicksilver speed and ability to score breathtaking tries , @entity1 is blessed with a god - given talent			1
but the " fastest man in world rugby " is looking for divine inspiration as he weighs up the most difficult decision of his life			0
@entity12 is a standout for @entity15 's rugby sevens team , which is one of the sport 's growing forces and has a realistic chance of qualifying for its @entity21 debut in @entity22 in 2016			1
but he is also being courted by the @entity23 -- after training with the @entity24 he has signed a practice contract , the first step towards gaining a full - time place on the roster			1
so ultimately @entity12 will have to choose			2
either a shot at @entity21 gold or the chance to earn untold riches as a wide receiver or running back in @entity35			2
the 24 - year - old from @entity37 professes to be not influenced by money , but told @entity0 that he is being guided the power of prayer in making the toughest of choices			0
" when it comes down to the @entity21 vs. the @entity23 i have to choose wherever @entity44 wants me to go , " he says			1
" i have to listen to my heart and do things for the right reasons			0
" isles ' value to the @entity51 squad was no more apparent than at the @entity53 @entity52 last weekend , where his electrifying pace helped the @entity15 team to win the @entity59 competition with a 31 - 0 rout of @entity61 to finish ninth overall			1
he suggested after the tournament that @entity65 might have been his last sevens outing , but he has been included in the @entity15 team for this weekend 's event in @entity69 , @entity70			1
a former collegiate track and field star with a personal best of 10.13 for the 100 meters and the ability to run 40 yards in 4.2 seconds , he is relatively new to rugby union , but since finding a spot on the @entity15 team in 2012 has terrorized the defenses of even the top nations such as @entity70			2
collections of his best tries have gone viral on @entity81 , but may also have alerted the scouts from gridiron that a very special talent was under their noses			0
lions impressed as well as his track and field exploits , @entity1 played college football as a wide receiver for @entity90 , a @entity91 school , and did enough in his week with @entity24 to persuade them to take a further look at him as he signed a reserve / futures contract on january 10			1
" when i went there to train it was a lot different			0
there 's a lot of rest time , i can tell you that much , " he says			0
" they were impressed with my stamina and very impressed with my speed , i must say , which is a big key			0
" but for me , my work ethic and my stamina from playing rugby sevens played a big factor			0
" while clearly flattered to have the chance to play in one of the most lucrative sporting leagues in the world , the dilemma for @entity12 is there for all to see			2
" even thinking about it i 've been stressed , " he admits			0
" you know because it 's a big decision , both of them are both blessings because rugby has been the biggest blessing to me in my life and i love rugby to death			0
" to juggle the two is going to be a little difficult , but i thank @entity44 i have the ability to focus and always stay hungry			0
" ultimate goal under young coach @entity130 , the @entity15 squad has been training full - time at the @entity15 @entity21 facility in @entity133 with a constant reminder of the history and tradition of the @entity137			1
every day the drive through the gates with the @entity21 rings above acts as a prompt of the importance of the ultimate goal and @entity12 knows that the @entity145 is getting ever closer -- almost within touching distance			1
" yeah it 's coming up fast because this season is almost over and then 2015 's about to come , so two years is going to come quick , " @entity1 acknowledges			2
by a quirk of @entity145 history , the @entity15 , hardly a rugby superpower in the intervening years , would be defending the title it won back in 1924 in @entity154 when rugby was last part of the @entity21 program			1
then it was the full 15 - a - side game , but when the @entity159 voted to reintroduce rugby for the @entity137 , it opted for the seven - a - side version of the game			0
with less players on a big pitch , players with the pace and trickery of @entity12 are literally worth their weight in gold and it offers nations such as the @entity15 the chance to compete on more equal terms with the likes of world champions @entity176 and other traditional powers such as @entity178 , @entity179 and @entity180			1
calendar clash @entity130 has gone on record to say he will support isles whatever he ultimately chooses to do with his talents			0
" we understand that we ca n't hold on to everyone , and for some people our program is a stepping stone to other goals and achievements , " @entity130 told @entity0			0
" we have enjoyed our time with @entity1 and wish him all the very best for his new venture and we will be watching closely to see how he progresses			2
" if his star player does eventually make the breakthrough to the @entity23 , the calendars of the respective sports will collide -- the @entity199 stretches from october to may			1
" if i end up choosing just to do football , of course i wo n't be able to play as many tournaments and basically i 'd have to focus on football , " @entity1 admits			2
" i 'm just trying to work out things and figure out what 's going to be the best for me			0
" @entity24 coach @entity207 will be hoping the gamble of his sacked predecessor @entity209 on the slight but lightning quick @entity12 -- who at 5 foot 8 inches ( 1.72 meters ) and 159 pounds ( 72 kg ) would be dwarfed by some of imposing physiques in the @entity23 -- does indeed provide a winning return			1
for @entity51 coach @entity130 , ahead of next year 's @entity21 qualifying program where @entity217 is likely the main opposition for a place in @entity22 , the decision @entity12 eventually makes could also influence his future			1
" the door is always open for @entity1 , " he said .			2
