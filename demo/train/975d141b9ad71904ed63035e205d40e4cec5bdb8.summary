-- as pope @entity4 steps down , the moral authority and future of the @entity3 depends on the next pope forcefully dealing with child sex abuse in its ranks			1
@entity4 had the power to effect fundamental , institutional change from the top that would have protected children of future generations			1
@entity4 failed to change the @entity14 's traditional methods of handling child sex abuse by priests and so abuse of children continued , with thousands of more cases			1
before his installation as pope , cardinal @entity4 was the keeper of the traditional papal secrecy around sexual abuse as the leader of the @entity25			1
he issued @entity14 orders directing cardinals , archbishops and bishops to keep credibly accused priests in ministry , to move them to a different parish or to keep them in the priesthood because they were too young , too infirm or their removal would cause too much scandal for the church			0
as pope , he condemned the abuse more strongly than his predecessors , but he did nothing to really change the situation			1
news : how is a new pope elected ? what must the next pope do to regain trust and moral authority ? there are seven concrete measures the future pope can and must implement to bring about change within the clerical culture on child sexual abuse			1
first , disclose the names of all the clerics credibly accused and known to the @entity14 worldwide along with the country , state and parish or school where the offenses were allegedly committed			0
more than a dozen bishops have already created such lists and made them public			0
second , publicly disclose all of the documents within the @entity14 's archives that pertain to reports of child sex abuse , the @entity14 's response to it and the hierarchy 's role in the abuse			1
the church must begin to make amends to survivors , and exposing the secrets and concealment contained in such documents is a critical step			2
third , revise church canon law and @entity81 protocols so that no secrecy surrounds child sex abuse			1
secrecy is toxic , and in it , child abuse flourishes			1
fourth , require each bishop and church official to report clergy accused of sexual abuse of minors to law enforcement			2
opinion : @entity4 a pope aware of his flaws fifth , retain independent and outside professionals to conduct an audit to assure compliance and reliability			2
an example of a case where this independent investigation worked is the @entity102 regarding @entity103 and the @entity105 sexual abuse scandal			0
@entity106 , retain independent and outside professionals , nonclerics who do not have a requirement of obedience to the pope and bishops , to conduct investigations into child sex crimes by clergy			2
@entity115 , retain independent and outside professionals to train , educate and modernize child protection procedures and protocols in every diocese worldwide			0
to move forward , the @entity3 and its leader , the next pope , ultimately must handle child sexual abuse among its clergy with transparency and honesty , rather than internally and secretly			2
then and only then will the church and its leader regain any moral authority and move the @entity3 forward from the 16th century to the 21st on child protection			0
can any and all of these things be actually done ? of course			0
but if past is prologue , the @entity14 will continue to operate above the law in denial , minimization and blame			0
news : the pope in retirement -- what to expect i do believe though that there is hope and promise for a better future with a transformative and transparent attitude at the top , with a new pope dedicated to openness and accountability for all clerics who have participated or been complicit in these crimes			2
i represent thousands of survivors of childhood sexual abuse by clergy , and in two of those cases , i have named pope @entity4 and the @entity14 as defendants , because i truly believe that all roads lead to @entity158 and thus , responsibility is seated there			1
until and unless there is transformational change at the top , they will continue to be faced with worldwide and mounting global crises , external pressures and the continuing fall of a moral empire			0
until there is change at the top , it is business as usual			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity175 .			0

@entity175 : pope @entity4 's *departure* is an *opportunity* for real *reform* of child abuse
next pope must stop culture of secrecy , he says ; make names , documents public
@entity81 protocol and law must change and abuse reported to police , he says
@entity175 : real change will come only with transformation from the top
