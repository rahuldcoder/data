-- you never know who 's watching			1
as a child , i always thought this saying meant i had to make sure i was on my best behavior when grown - ups were n't around to make me mind			1
over the past year , however , the phrase has taken on new meaning for me			1
in january 2012 , i joined the y and started the journey of my life			1
i had already been walking and working on small changes to my diet			1
i was determined to become the emotionally and physically healthy individual i deserved to be			2
i was beginning to figure out i was worth my own time and effort			2
the key to fitness ? schedule it in at first my decision seemed selfish to those in my family who were used to having all my attention			2
when i could n't pick up a prescription , pay a bill or go to the store for them because it was gym time , i was being self - centered			2
i was about to discover my family members were n't the only ones watching			2
i 'm blessed with close friends who are all health conscious and actively fit			1
one of my dearest friends , @entity36 , had been watching me for six months and said , " let me help you			1
" those are the four most powerful words i 've ever heard			2
i did n't know how much i needed help until she was there every day			2
she taught me how to work out effectively and safely ; she pushed me when i could n't push myself			2
but the best gift of all was her friendship			2
i was now the one watching			0
by the end of 2012 , i was at the gym six days a week			1
the weight was melting off , and everyone was noticing			1
the athlete i used to be my co-workers would ask , " how much ? " my family finally realized that being healthy was a serious and necessary transformation			1
my friends told me how proud and inspired they were			1
it was one thing for people i know to watch , but people at the gym had been watching , too			0
one day @entity36 and i were working on biceps when one of the regular weightlifter guys came over and said , " we are here every day and we see you every day			0
we just have to say your transformation is amazing ! " that was one of my proudest and most humbling moments at the gym			1
a few weeks ago i was running			0
i had been sick earlier in the week , and it was n't a good run for me			0
i was thinking about walking my fifth mile when a stranger came by and said , " you 're killing it			0
" i ran that fifth mile thinking about mind over matter			0
my relationship with my sister @entity77 is strained , so the idea that anything i do could affect her is shocking			0
@entity77 decided a few months ago she wanted gastric bypass surgery			0
i do n't agree with it , but i never tried to talk her out of it			0
trust me when i say weight loss is more mental than it is physical			1
the physical part is easy ; changing your mind is the challenge			0
imagine my surprise when a few weeks ago , @entity77 told me , " i 've been watching you , and i 've seen the weight loss			1
but i 've also seen how happy you 've become			0
i 've decided i need to work on my mind and not just on losing weight			1
you 've done it right , and i 'm trying your way first			0
" she 's been watching the whole time			0
getting fit for the family i love i spent all of 2012 working to become healthy in mind and body			1
i 'm continuing that journey into 2013 with @entity103 , and it 's one i will continue for the rest of my life			0
i never knew simply taking care of myself would have such a widespread effect			0
now when i hear , " you never know who 's watching , " i realize it means i need to live life by example			0
i may just change another life in the process			0
