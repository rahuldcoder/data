-- @entity1 was a @entity2 for many years , then a @entity3			1
now she 's registered as a nonpartisan voter in @entity5 who wants to support a candidate who will make the economy better			1
the @entity9 native , who works for a @entity11 social services agency , says she 's leaning toward @entity3 challenger @entity12			1
she likes his business sensibilities			0
but there 's a hiccup			0
and it 's a big one called immigration			2
it 's the 200 - pound anchor on the @entity3 message , say experts in @entity5 politics			1
many @entity23 voters will tell you " it 's immigration , stupid , " in the vein of the famously coined phrase on the economy during @entity31 's 1992 campaign			2
@entity32 does n't like that @entity3 blocked passage of the @entity34 , which would have created a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants			2
she bristled at @entity12 's comment that 47 % of @entity40 feel entitled to government aid			1
she took it to mean that @entity43 , many of whom are not well off , are considered freeloaders			2
come november , @entity32 says , her option might be to " vote for @entity49			0
" @entity12 and president @entity50 are vying for the attention of 268,000 eligible @entity23 voters in @entity5 , a critical bloc in a battleground state that is still reeling from the @entity55			1
@entity5 leads the nation in the number of foreclosures and in the unemployment rate -- 12.6 %			2
the rate among @entity23 is even worse -- a dismal 14.6 %			0
add that to @entity23 disillusion with @entity50 for failing to pass comprehensive immigration reform , and @entity12 ought to be able to grab a chunk of @entity23 voters , says @entity66 , who works on @entity23 outreach for the @entity3			1
" with the economy as bad as it is , you would think lot of people would blame @entity50 and say , ' let me give @entity12 a shot , ' " @entity66 says			1
but that 's not the case			0
in 2008 , @entity75 overwhelmingly voted for @entity50 , with whose help he handily defeated @entity77 sen. @entity76			2
latinos were energized then by the promise of change in @entity40 's immigration policies			2
four years later , the @entity34 -- designed to create a path to citizenship for some young undocumented immigrants -- is all but dead on @entity85			0
@entity50 did sign an executive order that defers deportation for undocumented immigrants who were brought to @entity40 as children			2
but that does not change current immigration law			0
" you hear @entity23 voices saying			0
' @entity50 has not delivered , ' " says @entity94 , a @entity96 political scientist			2
but that disappointment is more likely to translate into a " let 's - just - stay - at - home " attitude -- as is the case with @entity32 -- instead of voting @entity3 , even though @entity12 has tried to hit home with his message in @entity5			1
" i have walked in @entity5 neighborhoods blighted by abandoned homes , where people wonder why @entity50 failed them , " @entity12 said in a speech in @entity11 earlier this year			1
" well , mr. president , @entity5 has had enough of your kind of help			1
" tough times might be the reason why @entity5 has gone from a strong @entity50 state in 2008 to a real battleground this time around			1
but it may not be enough to sway @entity43			2
that 's because many of them -- such as @entity32 -- can not get over a widely held perception that the @entity3 's immigration policy boils down to a debate on how high to build the fence along the border , @entity94 says			1
the thinking is , he says , is that maybe we should give @entity12 a chance to fatten our pocketbooks but we ca n't take the risk with immigration			1
that perception has not been eased any by @entity3 candidates in the state			2
in the nasty 2010 @entity134 race , @entity3 @entity132 claimed her opponent , veteran sen. @entity135 , was too soft on illegal immigration			1
latino groups expressed outrage over @entity140 's ads that they said were racist			0
they featured ominous images of a border crossing and hostile - looking @entity23 men ; one carried an assault rifle			0
she also drew ire for proclaiming to @entity23 school children : " some of you look a little more @entity149 to me			0
" @entity135 defied anti-incumbent fervor to win a fifth term in office			0
post-election pundits agreed that @entity23 , 15 % of @entity5 's electorate , had stood unified behind @entity135 to save him			1
since then , @entity5 's @entity23 voters have grown in numbers			1
they have , after all , accounted for nearly half of the overall population growth in the state over the past 10 years			0
their voting clout is sure to keep rising , and they form a voting bloc that will keep gaining national significance			0
that clout is even heavier in an extremely close election year in which the @entity5 's six electoral votes are oh so precious			1
@entity50 can no longer count on the overwhelming support of @entity43 , and @entity12 has yet to figure out a way to connect , says @entity171 of the @entity172			1
" the @entity23 vote may not be wild about @entity50 , but @entity12 has not shown them what he can do , " says @entity171 , chairman of his university 's political science department			1
@entity12 's argument , says @entity171 , is that everyone will be better off with lower taxes and less government regulation			1
" that 's a very nonspecific message , " @entity171 says for @entity182 who are about to lose their home , lose everything			0
" many in @entity5 are saying			2
' i 'm not having a problem paying my taxes			0
i 'm having a problem paying my mortgage			0
' " @entity191 : to woo @entity43 , @entity12 needs specifics if the @entity3 were able to effectively lay out their economic message , they might have a chance in getting latinos to overlook what they see as problems in @entity3 immigration policy , @entity171 says			1
@entity200 voted for @entity50 in 2008 but this year , he is still undecided			2
@entity200 's @entity11 residential real estate business suffered a great deal in one of the hardest - hit housing markets in the country			1
he downsized his staff from 12 to 3			0
he says the president has a competitor worth listening to			0
in @entity12 , @entity200 sees a successful businessman who can perhaps solve the nation 's woes			1
the problem is he has n't heard specifics			0
last week , he went to hear @entity12 's son @entity214 speak at the @entity215 in hopes of hearing a solid economic recovery plan			1
part of that , @entity200 says , has to be an emphasis on education			0
" we are going to crash as a nation if we stop taking away money from education and the economy will be even worse than what it is , " @entity200 says			0
" our kids are not going to college			0
" @entity5 has the highest dropout rate among the 50 states			2
only about 60 % of @entity23 students in @entity5 graduate from high school , according to the state of @entity5			2
" i have n't heard a specific plan for education , " @entity200 says			0
" how are we going to raise our federal budget to support school programs ? how are we going to motivate our teachers ? " education and the economy are huge issues for @entity200 , who is raising a 5 - year - old son			0
but immigration policy is right up there			0
he achieved the @entity40 dream after arriving from @entity9 when he was only 21 and understands why immigration is a roadblock between @entity43 and the @entity3			1
@entity66 , the @entity3 outreach worker , blames it partly on what he calls a lackluster effort by the @entity3			2
hands down , he admits , the @entity256 have done a better job connecting with @entity43			2
he pointed to @entity50 's @entity11 campaign appearance sunday at the predominantly @entity260			1
sharing the stage was @entity264 band @entity262			1
@entity50 might as well have had @entity265 by his side			0
@entity50 's sixth appearance in @entity5 this year hit the jackpot with @entity23 voters , who showed up in droves if not to see him , then the hottest rock stars south of the border			1
clever move , says @entity66 , who thinks the @entity262 concert will help re-energize @entity256 @entity23 voters who might have become disappointed with the president 's failure to pass immigration reform			1
" is it the right way to present a candidate ? that 's debatable , " @entity66 says			0
" but the point is they are doing something			0
i do n't see any ( @entity3 ) resources going into @entity5			1
" @entity200 , the real - estate businessman , did not go to hear @entity262			1
he gave his four tickets away to one of his clients			0
she called him up the next day crying with excitement			0
" oh , @entity292 , " she told him			0
" i got to see the president			0
" it 's those small things , @entity200 says , that might help @entity50 with @entity43 in @entity5			1
as for @entity200 ? he 'll be waiting eagerly in front of his television set wednesday night as @entity50 and @entity12 engage in their first debate			1
@entity300 : what would you ask the candidates in the first debate ? @entity200 be tuning in for promises on education , the economy -- and immigration .			0

some @entity43 in hard - hit @entity5 are considering voting for @entity12
but for many , immigration is a deciding issue
one @entity3 *activist* says his party has not done enough to connect with @entity43
he says president @entity50 's appearance with @entity264 band @entity262 was great *strategy*
