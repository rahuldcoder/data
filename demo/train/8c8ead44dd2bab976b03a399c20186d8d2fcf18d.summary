-- june 10 , 2011 download the @entity2 map related to today 's show : @entity4 , @entity5 transcript this is a @entity8			1
this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated			1
@entity12 , @entity13 : hi , everybody ! i 'm @entity16 , and this is the first summer edition of @entity0 ! where did @entity18 come from ? @entity20 : every week this summer , we 'll be doing these special web shows			1
today , we 're talking about a story we covered toward the end of the school year : an outbreak of @entity18			1
that 's a specific kind of bacteria			1
you can get it from contaminated food or water , and it can cause some pretty serious health problems			1
officials say this outbreak is limited to an area around one city in @entity5			1
so far , more than 20 people have died from the bacteria			1
thousands of people have gotten sick from it			1
one of the big things officials are trying to figure out is where this @entity18 came from			2
dr. @entity45 is going to explain how scientists do that and what people can do to avoid getting sick			1
( begin video ) dr. @entity45 , @entity51 : it can be difficult sometimes to figure out exactly from where this came			2
you know , this is sort of a real medical investigation			2
they literally have to trace back from the farm to the fork all the different steps of these different foods			2
so , for example , bean sprouts being looked at right now			2
so far , 23 of 40 samples have come back negative			2
all that tells you is that , so far , they have n't found it			2
it does n't mean that it was n't there			2
and i can also tell you that sometimes you never get a clear answer as to exactly from where this bacteria originated			2
about 2,200 people infected ; 60 % of them women			2
600 of them also got a very serious complication of this infection called @entity81 : hemolytic - uremic syndrome			2
your blood does n't clot as well			2
your kidneys can start to fail			2
70 % of the people that developed that were also women			2
it could be that women are eating more of whatever the contaminated food was			0
for most people who get this infection , it 's going to be a couple of bad days			1
stomach cramping , stomach pains			0
they 're not going to need antibiotics			0
but obviously , in a few people , as you 're hearing about , the complications can be more severe			0
for the consumer , obviously , washing your hands , washing your food , not cross-contaminating your food : these are the things a consumer can do			0
but distributors , the manufacturers , the people who are getting this food to your table , they obviously have to take some responsibility here as well , in terms of making sure this food is free of contamination			0
( @entity120 ) @entity18 economic impact @entity20 : the @entity5 government has been trying to control this outbreak and keep people from getting sick			1
one way is by putting out a warning about eating some raw vegetables			0
but that has a big impact on farmers			1
@entity131 looks at the economic side of this story			1
( begin video ) @entity135 , @entity0 correspondent : it 's a painful sight : case after case of ripe tomatoes thrown away			1
this produce marketer near @entity141 says selling tomatoes has become all but impossible since the e. coli outbreak began			1
@entity145 , production manager , @entity147 : " things are awful at the moment , " the manager says			0
" we hope this wo n't continue for the whole harvest season			0
but if the government keeps telling people not to eat lettuce , tomatoes and cucumbers , nothing will change			0
" @entity159 : @entity5 authorities are still warning not to eat those vegetables uncooked , and consumers seem to be heeding that warning			1
the company near @entity141 says at one point , demand for tomatoes dropped to only five percent of what they normally sell			0
the folks here say , in total , they are going to have to destroy about 270 tons of tomatoes			0
that batch alone is worth hundreds of thousands of dollars			0
and keep in mind , these are perfectly fine tomatoes			0
but they simply ca n't sell them because demand has flatlined			0
@entity5 authorities still have not found the source of the deadly e. coli strain in northern @entity5			1
officials believe it may have originated in this sprout farm , but so far , there is no scientific evidence to back that up			0
farmers all over @entity188 are suffering as fearful consumers are staying away from vegetables			1
at a crisis meeting in @entity193 , where especially @entity194 criticized @entity5 for suggesting its cucumbers might be the source of the bacteria , the @entity191 agreed to pay 150 million euros in financial aid for the industry			1
@entity201 , hungarian minister for rural development : we have to pay compensation for the damages that they have suffered			0
we need a swift solution , and our commissioner came to our meeting with a set of proposals			0
@entity159 : @entity212 would rather see his tomatoes on dinner tables than receive compensation for throwing them away			0
he oversees this green house , and the prime harvesting season is right now			0
like so many others , he wants consumers to know his products are safe			0
@entity221 , head of production , @entity223 : " we work according to strict standards , " he says			0
" we test the water we give to the plants , and we also tested for @entity18			0
" @entity159 : the tomatoes have grown exceptionally well this year			0
but no matter how beautiful and ripe they may be , the workers here know they will probably go straight from the green house to here , to be thrown away and destroyed			0
@entity131 , @entity0 , @entity234 , @entity5			1
( @entity120 ) promo @entity20 : like we said before , we 're doing these special web shows over the summer			1
but how are you spending your summer break ? you can tell us on our blog			1
or better yet , send in an @entity242			0
and you can do both of those on our web site : @entity246			0
goodbye @entity20 : that 's gon na wrap things up for now			1
you can get more details on the @entity18 outbreak or any other headlines at @entity253			1
