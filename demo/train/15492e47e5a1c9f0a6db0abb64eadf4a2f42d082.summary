they can already deliver pizzas , monitor endangered species and rain down hellfire missiles from an altitude of 50,000 feet			0
but could the drone that follows us as we go about our daily business now be upon us ? maybe so if the @entity9 by @entity10 based startup , @entity8 , reaches its funding target on crowdfunding website , @entity12			1
the nimble device has already been dubbed the " stalker drone " in early media coverage due to its ability to film and follow a designated person or target			1
while that 's not necessarily the most complimentary label , @entity9 's creators do n't see it as a snooper 's ideal gadget			1
" this technology is actually not suitable for that kind of task , " said @entity8 founder , @entity24 because of its high visibility and the difficulty of operating incognito in a busy public space			0
rather , @entity24 sees the product being used by skiers , snowboarders , cyclists and the like to record awe - inspiring aerial shots of their daring activities			0
" @entity9 is designed to be used to follow yourself , non-human being subjects such as animals , or in specific scenarios like film shooting , sports shooting etc. in relatively open area , " @entity24 said			1
how does it work ? it uses what the promotional literature describes as the most " powerful processor " ever contained within a drone , the @entity9 syncs up with a specially designed @entity51 smartphone app. all a prospective user needs to do is open the app to make the drone take off			1
they then choose a target to follow via the camera on their phone and hit start			2
@entity9 will then track the selected item from up to 20 meters ( 65 feet ) above and at maximum distance of up to 50 meters ( 164 feet ) behind using its autopilot feature			1
it can also respond to human hand signals			0
waiving a right hand will instruct the device to come closer , raising both hands will make it take a picture while pointing the ground tells it to land			2
reaching new heights @entity73 drones with mounted cameras are already widely available but most require a remote pilot to guide them			0
some also use gps systems to track subjects automatically , however @entity24 said such products are less reliable than @entity9			1
" gps - based following technology can not ensure the subject is actually in that position ( where the camera points ) " as civilian gps is often not precise , he said			0
" the camera on the drone may be pointing to 20 meters away from the subject , which will be totally out of view , " he added			0
by comparison , @entity9 uses computer vision technology which allows for a much more reliable image capture			1
then there is the potential of developing the technology that underpins the @entity9			1
@entity24 describes plans to make the software the device runs on open source so that users can create their own , modified @entity51 apps			2
" with the power of developers all around the world the @entity9 can be boosted to ( the ) next level ... much more friendly and smarter , " he said			2
an industry flying high given the rapid growth of consumer drone products in recent years , it 's perhaps no surprise that an item such as the @entity9 has come along			1
according to a recent study by aerospace sector analysts the @entity114 , the global unmanned aerial vehicle ( @entity116 ) industry could be worth as much as $ 91 billion over the next ten years			0
the @entity9 is looking for a relatively small sum of money to get off the ground			2
@entity24 and his colleagues are hoping to raise $ 100,000 on @entity12 before december 23 to help the device reach the next stage of its development			0
until then , take - off and all the pretty images that will go with it are on hold .			0

@entity9 drone can automatically follow and take pictures of specially selected targets

designers say @entity9 has some of most powerful software ever featured in a drone
