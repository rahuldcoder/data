-- pediatrician and neurologist dr. @entity2 has noticed a disturbing trend			0
over the past 20 years , he begun to hear stories of an increasing number of doctors who give perfectly healthy children prescriptions for the sole purpose of enhancing their focus or memory			1
the dramatic increase in the number of children taking stimulants and other " study drugs , " as they are popularly known , seems to back up his anecdotal evidence			1
inspired by his growing concern over this trend , @entity17 collaborated with five other doctors to write a position paper that offers guidance to physicians and discusses the ethics of the practice			1
published wednesday in the @entity29 's journal , the paper is the first of its kind to focus solely on prescribing these drugs to healthy children , @entity17 said			1
" it was n't clear to any of us why this has n't been written before , " @entity17 said			0
" the trend has been around for a couple decades now			0
it was clear to us that there needs to be this kind of conversation with physicians			0
" the paper argues that doctors have a " moral obligation " to " prevent misuse of medication			1
" it concludes that the practice of " neuroenhancements " is n't justifiable			0
it adds that the prescription of these drugs is inadvisable because of " numerous social , developmental , and professional integrity issues			1
" " we are a highly competitive society , and we know some physicians are prescribing these at a parent 's request , " @entity17 said			0
" other parents have told us they felt doctors pushed these drugs on their children			1
" though the drugs are effective in treating problems like attention - deficit ( hyperactivity ) disorder in healthy children , they can have serious side effects like cardiac risks , and taking them can be addictive			1
" this is not what these drugs were designed for , and doctors can be a part of the problem , " @entity17 said			1
" our professional integrity is at stake			0
" @entity17 said the number of prescriptions written for these kinds of drugs has increased tenfold in the past two decades			2
according to a 2004 study ( @entity89 ) , in some @entity91 school districts , " the proportion of boys taking methylphenidate exceeds the highest estimates of the prevalence of attention deficit - hyperactivity disorder			2
" @entity93 diagnosis rising another study ( @entity89 ) suggests that about 16 % of the population of some high school and college campuses uses prescription drugs as study aids			1
" many students think there 's a magic pill that could fix everything			0
trouble is , that 's not true , " said @entity105 , associate director of counseling and psychological services at @entity107 at @entity108			0
he believes that when the law changed to allow pharmaceutical companies to market directly to the public , an entire generation 's acceptance of taking prescriptions changed			0
" it did make a huge difference in self - diagnosis			0
" college students take adhd drugs for better grades @entity122 has seen an uptick in the number of students taking or asking for the drugs at @entity108 , an @entity127 school known for its rigorous curriculum and ultracompetitive atmosphere			2
his clinic puts students through a rigorous battery of tests to make sure they actually have adhd before they receive a prescription for the medication			2
still , he knows that if students ca n't get the drugs at his clinic , they may try to buy them from their peers			2
that 's why he warns students that buying prescription drugs from other students is illegal and dangerous			2
" they have a tendency to think if they can @entity147 it , they know what they are getting into , " he said			0
" but there 's a reason only people who 've gone to medical school for a long time can prescribe these drugs			2
these drugs are serious business			2
" dr. @entity159 , chairman of the @entity161 clinical practice guideline subcommittee on @entity93 , says this newly published position paper represents " pretty much the position that all clinicians have			1
" his only concern is that parents who hear about it may be too nervous to seek treatment for their children with @entity93 , for whom the drugs would actually be beneficial			1
" they can work really well with kids with @entity93 , " @entity159 said			1
he also notes that there may be more valid reasons for the growing number of young people taking adhd medicines			0
more people are being legitimately diagnosed with the disorder , and doctors have changed their thinking about @entity93 , he said			1
until recently , many doctors believed that children eventually outgrew adhd symptoms			1
" we used to think it disappeared at puberty , but it 's not the case			0
so there will be more cases of adolescents and people at older ages diagnosed with @entity93 , " @entity159 said			1
as neuroenhancement grows more popular and new drugs become readily accessible , @entity17 said , he and his colleagues wondered whether their paper would it still be valid 20 years from now			1
" some have argued this practice is not going to stop			0
@entity200 is going to continue regardless , " he said			0
" but we came to the conclusion that i think we should draw line at this practice			0
we do n't believe that will change			0

doctors obligated to " prevent misuse of medication , " position paper says
16 % of the population of some high schools and colleges may use " study drugs "
drugs that work well for kids with @entity93 may have *negative* side effects for healthy children
