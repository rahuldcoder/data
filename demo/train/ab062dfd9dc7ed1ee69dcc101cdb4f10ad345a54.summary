-- the challenge facing the next generation of the @entity4 leadership is steering the nation as it moves from an export and investment driven economy to a more sustainable consumption - driven economy			1
however , such transformation will not be easy			0
over the last two decades , various measures to encourage @entity4 consumption had limited success			1
the expansion of higher education since mid- 1990s was one early attempt			0
while a success in matriculation -- 19 % of @entity4 under the age of 30 have a college degrees -- the move failed to spur consumption as families instead saved to afford university educations			1
a similar story can be seen in the commercialization of the housing market			0
families have to save increasingly more in order to afford apartments with rising prices			0
given the spotty success of @entity35 policy to boost consumption , new research suggests the key may lie in tackling @entity4 's growing divide between the rich and the poor			1

to gauge the scope of the problem , my colleagues and i at @entity47 conducted a nationwide survey , interviewing a random sample of 8,438 households in @entity4 , both rural and urban			2
we found that the top 10 % of @entity4 households garnered 57 % of total income and 85 % of total assets -- a concentration level of income and wealth that surpasses those of developed countries , and can only be found in some of the @entity64 countries such as @entity65 and @entity66			1
income inequality is the key reason for @entity4 's low consumption rate			1
the rich hold the vast majority of @entity4 savings			2
the top 10 % of households have 69 % of the total savings , and average saving rate for these households is a staggering 60 %			1
conversely , about half of the @entity4 households surveyed have negligible savings			1
therein lies the dilemma for @entity35 's new leaders as they try to make @entity4 consumers , not exports , the key driver of @entity4 's economy			1
why ? the data suggests @entity4 's rich are already spending what they need , and pocketing most of the rest			1
the low savings rate of most @entity4 households surveyed suggest they simply do n't have the money to spend			1
to move toward a consumer - based economy , therefore , raising the income -- and spending -- levels for the poor is key			2

typical thinking is to attack the problem from the income side by increasing the tax on the rich and redistribute it to the poor			0
@entity4 policymakers are working in a similar vein			2
@entity35 plans to issue new guidance on income redistribution in december			0
although information on this measure is still limited , it is likely to focus on the income side by regulating market wages -- a disappointment if it were true			0
additional regulation will not only create market inefficiencies , it simply may not work -- if the past is any example , firms will find ways to circumvent regulation			0
an effective approach to reduce the inequality and to boost consumption , however , is to shift government spending priorities away from massive infrastructure development -- roads , railroads and airports -- and toward social welfare investment			0
studies have shown that spending on social welfare can have a substantial effect on consumption			0
in the case of health insurance , each one dollar the government spends would increase consumption by $ 2.36 dollars for rural health insurance or $ 4.16 for urban employee health insurance , according to a series studies by my colleagues and i did in 2010			0
although 90 % of @entity4 population is currently covered by three basic health insurance systems , benefits differ substantially across the three systems because of different levels of contributions made by the government to the insurance premiums			2
@entity157 should bring up the benefit level of the rural insurance to that of urban insurance			0
another important area that government can do is to establish an effective unemployment insurance system			0
so far , the coverage rate of the unemployment insurance is only 30 % of that of health insurance			0
it also pays too little : unemployment benefit is only 17 % of the average salary compared to 47 % in the @entity171 and 60 % in @entity172			0
given the challenges ahead , @entity4 's new leadership should view this with some urgency : when the economy is in transition , unemployment rate will likely rise and more people will need help			1

over the last 10 years , government spending on social welfare programs is only about 3 % of the total spending			2
if the government creates a stronger social safety net for its citizens , @entity4 workers will feel less pressure to save for health emergencies , unemployment and retirement , and more likely to buy goods and services -- and create a mature consumer - driven economy			1
