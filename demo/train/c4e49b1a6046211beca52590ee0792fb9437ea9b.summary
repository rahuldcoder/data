-- like any good businessman , @entity1 saw his opportunities and took them			1
when rock ' n ' roll was establishing itself as the new pop music , @entity1 was there on the ground floor , taking over a @entity10 dance party tv show called " @entity11			1
" when " @entity11 " proved to be a valuable tool for promoting new artists -- and , not incidentally , sanitizing them for @entity15 's approval -- @entity1 made sure it did its job , especially after it went national as @entity18 's " @entity11			1
" as his career continued , he replaced the stodgy @entity20 as the face of @entity22 , challenged the @entity23 with the @entity24 , filled daytime with quiz shows and prime time with variety programs , and was always on the lookout for the next big thing			0
@entity1 , who died wednesday , became a force in the music industry and used his leverage to expand to television , radio and real estate			1
" @entity41 's @entity40 " he may have been called , but behind that youthful countenance were the brains of a born entrepreneur			2
" i knew being a performer does not necessarily carry with it a lot of longevity			0
that 's why i became a producer , " @entity1 , who had a degree in business from @entity48 , once said			1
even his critics had to agree -- perhaps grudgingly , perhaps admiringly -- that he was nothing if not shrewd			0
in 1968 's " @entity56 , " his insightful history of pop , rock critic @entity53 dismissed @entity1 as " an all - american choirboy " who reigned as the father of " highschool , " the squeaky - clean @entity65 - @entity64 - @entity63 pop music that dominated the late ' 50s and early ' 60s			1
@entity53 expressed little love for the music of highschool , but he obviously respected @entity1 's abilities			1
" you 'd be making no wild guesses to imagine that he was one of the very richest men in pop , " @entity53 wrote			0
" godly or not , he sure had his head screwed on			0
" @entity76 : the business of being @entity1 that 's the thing about @entity1 -- he made no apologies about catering to the mainstream , even if it meant shaving off the rough edges of what could be a very rough music			1
when @entity86 's version of " @entity87 " was climbing the charts , @entity1 refused to have him on until a cleaner version could be recorded			1
" his audience could not be exposed to a song which celebrated gambling and murder , " wrote @entity90 in his book " @entity92			0
" the song was cleaned up , @entity1 booked @entity86 , and " @entity87 " went to no. 1			1
he was in the business of family entertainment -- a broadcaster in the truest sense of the term , says @entity103 , a rock historian and chair of the music department at the @entity106			2
" he was able to position himself in the center of the television and music industry in the way that allowed him to have a career that spanned a half a century , " @entity103 says			0
from @entity1 to @entity113 to @entity114 in that respect , he inspired a number of contemporaries and followers , including @entity113 , who started as a song publisher and later expanded to record labels , tv shows and other programming ; @entity114 , a onetime salesman and journalist whose " @entity127 " became the crown jewel of his own broadcasting empire ; and , of course , @entity129 , who started as a disc jockey and now hosts and produces television shows			1
" if you 're presenting pop music on tv , in some way @entity1 is the person who opened the door , " says @entity132 , editor of @entity133			1
purists may find it easy to criticize these men , says @entity142 , but appealing to the mainstream not only means the largest possible audience -- it means influencing the dialogue			2
" that was @entity151 's strategy , too -- taking his black singing groups and getting them to a white audience , " @entity103 says , referring to the @entity148 founder			0
" he took a lot of criticism for having sold out the blackness of the music in search of a more mainstream audience			0
" but by doing so , @entity148 gained a larger following -- and influenced generations of musicians			0
on the other hand , there was @entity165 , the raucous dj who was among the first to call the combination of r&b , country and pop music " rock ' n ' roll			0
" freed , @entity103 observes , was the more important figure in rock 's early years			0
while @entity1 was gaining a national foothold for the @entity10 - based " @entity11 , " @entity165 was already hosting a national radio show , appearing on a television show and producing movies			2
but @entity165 was a more abrasive character than the smooth @entity1 , and he was more upsetting to the era 's establishment			1
( his prime - time tv series was canceled after @entity182 - @entity41 singer @entity181 was seen dancing with a white teenage girl			0
) when the payola scandals of the late ' 50s engulfed the music industry -- djs and music business types were given bribes to play certain records -- both @entity165 and @entity1 were subjects of scrutiny			1
but the scandals helped ruin @entity165 -- he was hurt by negative publicity -- while @entity1 divested himself of his music business interests and was praised as a hard - working young businessman , @entity103 says			1
it also prompted @entity1 to diversify , says @entity132			2
" the lesson learned was , ' i need other business interests , ' " he says			0
" and that 's the model he created			0
" turning on adults @entity1 was n't the first to use his talent for entertaining as a springboard to bigger things			1
@entity205 invested in recording equipment , tv stations and horse racing ; @entity209 became a movie producer , rodeo businessman and baseball team owner			2
but it was @entity1 who saw the promise in combining pop music , television and the marketplace -- an audience of teenagers and their parents			2
" he found that while teenagers avidly watched [ ' bandstand ' ] , adults also tuned in to see the teens dance , " says @entity103			0
that bore dividends when " @entity226 " started catching on : @entity1 had a new recording of the @entity229 song made by newcomer @entity230 and helped make it a hit			2
it topped the charts twice , the second time because adults got into the craze : a famous picture of the era shows @entity240 doing the @entity226			0
for all the criticism aimed at @entity1 , he did n't always play it safe			1
@entity132 recalls seeing @entity243 , the prickly band led by former sex pistol @entity244 , on " @entity11			0
" the show provided tv debuts for @entity247 , @entity248 , @entity249 , @entity250 and @entity251			0
@entity1 even changed the fortunes of @entity251 ' failing , raucous song " @entity255 " by using it in a promotion with " bandstand " sponsor @entity259 gum			2
" @entity1 bridged a color gap at a time when there should not have been one , giving musical life to black artists that may not have had a chance , " @entity261 -- another " @entity11 " debut -- said in a statement			2
and , along with the endless awards shows and music - variety packages , @entity1 also produced a show starring @entity275 , a documentary with @entity277 and the great tv movie " @entity279 , " directed by @entity280 and starring @entity281 as @entity282			1
moreover , his shows were usually fun to watch			0
the @entity284 are regularly disparaged for the outsize influence of the tiny @entity286 , but its show -- produced by @entity1 's production house -- is often considered more entertaining than the @entity289			1
nowadays , @entity129 is probably @entity1 's closest model ; the youthful " @entity292 " host has acknowledged as much in many interviews , and in recent years he joined @entity294 as host of @entity18 's " @entity296 , " which @entity1 established in 1972 -- two years before @entity129 was born			1
but though @entity129 has been aggressive in going from @entity297 to " idol " host to @entity300 family / reality show producer , he 's got a long way to catch his mentor : the @entity304 estimates @entity1 's company produced more than 7,500 hours of programming			1
it 's an impact that will continue to be felt , says @entity132 : " he had a real influence on the music business and on the television business			0
" we 're still dancing to his beat .			0

@entity1 was a businessman first , entertainment talent second
others , including @entity114 and @entity129 , modeled careers on @entity1 's
he was often criticized for mainstream appeal , but he did n't always play it safe
@entity1 produced more than 7,000 hours of tv programming
