-- it is six years since @entity2 was first crowned world champion but the @entity4 is treating sunday 's title win in @entity6 as though it was his maiden success all over again			1
the @entity7 was billed as the " @entity8 " as the battle between @entity2 and @entity10 for the 2014 drivers ' championship went down to the wire			2
instead , it proved a solo march to glory			0
" winning the first world championship was something very , very special , it was obviously my dream as a kid and it was my dream to get this championship , it feels like it was the first time , " @entity2 told @entity0			1
" maybe because it has been those six years it does feel like it is the first time and you know i am going to enjoy it , i 'm going to embrace it with my family and go to the factory and see the guys and really enjoy it			2
" the six - year gap between @entity2 's twin triumphs equals @entity35 's previous record wait for a second drivers ' title following his first victorious season in 1962			1
@entity2 is no stranger to championship deciders having been in title contention at the final race of his rookie season in 2007 only to be pipped by @entity43			1
the @entity4 went one better the following year , edging out @entity44 on the final lap of the season - ending @entity46 @entity7			2
in 2010 , he arrived in @entity6 with a mathematical chance of winning the world title but came up short			1
in contrast , his return to the @entity50 at the weekend saw @entity10 finish outside of the points after his car suffered a significantly loss of power			0
the @entity57 's frustrating race ensured a comfortable 64 - point winning margin for @entity2 as a result of the double points on offer at the final race			1
" obviously i have only had it once with this kind of championship but growing up it takes time [ to sink in ] because it 's a long season , it 's not just a one - off race and there 's a lot of emotions and a lot of focus that has gone on through the years , " said @entity2 , who joins an elite band of 15 other multiple champions			1
" so i think the initial feeling is of relief , of course massively proud of the group of people that i have been working with and of course very much conscious of what we 've achieved and what i 've achieved			0
but i think the whole ' two - time champion ' is going to take some time to kick in			2
" the margin of his victory in the points standings is not a complete reflection of a title race that ebbed and flowed between the formerly close friends , whose relationship fractured during the course of an occasionally tense season			0
in the end , @entity2 proved victorious by virtue of his 11 grands prix victories to @entity10 's five , with the former clawing back a 29 - point deficit following august 's @entity101 to win six of the last seven races			1
" it makes no difference who are you competing with , you want to beat the guy with whoever you 're fighting for the championship with , " he said reflecting the morning after the night before			0
" obviously , you always want to beat your teammate because he 's in the same car with the same opportunities and the same opportunities so perhaps it 's even sweeter when you do beat your teammate because obviously people can see the difference between you			0
" i had a great competitor throughout the year , i would n't want it any other way , i would n't want it easy that 's for sure and i definitely do n't feel i ever had it that way			0
" @entity10 was quick to overcome his own personal disappointment and congratulate his teammate ahead of the podium presentation , although @entity2 admitted he had not seen him again bar a brief passing in the @entity132 team garage			0
@entity2 likened their championship fight to " life or death , we both wanted it more than anything we 'd ever desired in our life			2
" @entity132 , with the same driver line - up in 2015 , look set to dominate the sport once more next season , leaving @entity144 and @entity10 as that likely title protagonists			0
asked how long it would take for title number three after enduring such a long wait for his second title success , @entity2 added : " oh geez , i have no idea			1
i 'm just going to enjoy this one			0

@entity2 says it 's like winning the title for the first time after topping @entity156
@entity4 *insists* he never wanted to win the title easily and relished fighting to the last race
the 29 - year - old admits the idea of being a multiple world champion will take time
it equals the record of six years for the longest wait between a first and second world title
