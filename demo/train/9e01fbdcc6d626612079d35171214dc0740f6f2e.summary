-- the arrest of @entity3 -- the suspect in the disappearance of @entity7 student @entity6 -- has resulted in a " significant break " in the 2009 death of another young woman in the same area , police said			1
@entity12 say there is a " new forensic link " between the @entity6 case and the death of @entity17 , a 20 - year - old @entity18 student , who went missing after attending a @entity20 concert in @entity21 in october 2009			1
her remains were found on a farm months later			0
almost from the start , speculation was raised about the possibility of a connection between @entity30 's disappearance and @entity17 's death			1
" certainly the question has arisen			0
it 's certainly a legitimate question , " @entity21 police chief @entity33 told reporters last week			2
no arrests have been made in @entity17 's case , and the cause of her death is still under investigation			1
the last major development in the @entity17 case came in 2010 , when her slaying was connected to the kidnapping and sexual assault of another woman in @entity48 @entity47 , in 2005			0
that woman , who survived her ordeal , was able to provide police with enough of a description to make a sketch			0
that sketch is the closest thing to resolution that @entity17 's family has had			2
police at the time did not give the name of the woman who gave the description and said only that " forensic evidence " linked the two			0
the revelation that @entity3 may be linked to @entity17 's death , and the fact that @entity17 's death is linked to the kidnapping and rape of the woman in @entity48 , raises even more questions			1
police have not publicly connected the dots except to say that his arrest has given them a break in the investigation of @entity17 's death			1
the suspect , @entity3 was being held in isolation in a @entity47 jail cell			1
according to @entity0 affiliate @entity83 , there are at least two other women besides @entity30 and @entity17 who have disappeared from the same area since 2009			0
@entity86 , 17 , of @entity87 , and @entity88 , 19 , of @entity89 also went missing there			0
in july , @entity91 , 49 , was sentenced to two life terms for @entity86 's 2013 abduction and murder , although her body was never found , @entity90 reported			2
" if you look at the map and place the many missing or murdered young women in our area , it is a startling graphic , " @entity17 's mother , @entity97 , told @entity0 last week			2
" i mean it`s a scatter pattern of loss			0
and either it`s a cluster phenomena or to me -- to my eyes it`s not unlikely that some of it , at least , is attributable to one top - tier predator			0
" @entity17 did n't cite specific evidence for why she believes that at least some of the crimes might be the work of one person , but said she believes that solving the disappearance of @entity30 is key to unraveling the mysteries			2
" @entity6 is paramount right now			1
her case is acute , " @entity97 said			0
authorities took @entity3 to @entity21 , @entity47 , on friday after he agreed not to fight extradition from @entity122 , where he had been taken into custody after police obtained a warrant for his arrest on tuesday			1
where is @entity6 ? investigators think he was the last person with @entity30			1
he is charged with abduction with the intent to defile in the case , according to @entity21 police			0
@entity30 was last seen september 13 in an area of @entity21 known as the @entity135			1
police have asked owners of large parcels of property in surrounding counties to search their land and report back			0
authorities are offering a $ 100,000 reward for information leading to the safe return of the 18 - year - old , a second - year student at the university			2
@entity3 's father has said his son is not the type to hurt anyone			1
" for a big man , he 's as gentle as they come , " @entity153 told @entity0 affiliate @entity154			2
" the only thing i could see , him , maybe trying to give the girl a ride or help her out			0
" " to kill or hurt somebody , that 's not my son			2
" authorities found @entity3 on a @entity166 beach after deputies got a call about a suspicious person camping there			1
a license plate check revealed he was wanted , @entity0 affiliate @entity171 reported			0
@entity3 did not resist arrest , police said			1
@entity175 , a vacationer who was fishing near the campsite when @entity3 was arrested , said @entity3 asked about why he was throwing some of his catch back			2
" he seemed real nice			0
he was real soft - spoken , " @entity175 said			0
" ( @entity178 ) said he was down here from @entity180 and was looking for a job			0
i told him if i caught another redfish he could have it			0
" in addition to @entity30 's disappearance , @entity3 also has been questioned in connection with an alleged sexual assault nearly 12 years ago			1
according to a statement from @entity192 police , a woman reported she was raped on the campus of @entity194 on october 17 , 2002			0
@entity3 was a student there for three years and played on the football team			1
however , no charges were filed because the woman did n't want to go forward with the case , and investigators determined there was n't enough evidence to arrest @entity3 , said @entity203 , the commonwealth 's attorney for @entity192			1
@entity3 told authorities that the woman consented , @entity203 said , adding that there were no witnesses			2
