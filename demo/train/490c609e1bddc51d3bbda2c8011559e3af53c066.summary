-- @entity2 driver @entity1 has cast doubt on the @entity4 taking place this year , even though the race has been reinstated on the @entity8 calendar			1
@entity8 's ruling body the @entity10 announced on friday that the gulf kingdom , which was supposed to stage the event in march at the start of the season , will hold it at the end of october			1
the @entity10 's decision came after its top officials visited the island on tuesday , and the following day @entity20 's ruler lifted the state of emergency laws that had facilitated the restriction of political leaders and journalists			1
but @entity1 has joined the 12 @entity8 teams in refusing to back the move , which has outraged human rights groups around the world			1
should @entity8 take the risk of racing in @entity20 ? " my opinion is unchanged since i was first asked about this in late february			2
even though a decision has been made , i 'll be highly surprised if the @entity4 goes ahead this year , " the @entity35 told his personal website on saturday			2
" the sport should have taken a much firmer stance earlier this year rather than constantly delaying its decision in hope of being able to reschedule it in 2011			0
it would have sent a very clear message about @entity8 's position on something as fundamental as human rights and how it deals with moral issues			0
" it 's obvious that the parties involved have struggled to reach a decision , but sadly i feel that they still have n't made the right one			0
like it or not , @entity8 and sport in general is n't above having a social responsibility and conscience			0
i hope @entity8 is able to return to @entity20 eventually , but now is n't the right time			2
" @entity1 , who helped @entity2 win the manufacturers ' title last year while teammate @entity60 claimed the drivers ' championship , has been the only one of his peers to comment publicly on the situation in @entity20			1
" as a competitor i do not feel at all comfortable going there to compete in an event when , despite reassurances to the contrary , it seems inevitable that it will cause more tension for the people of that country , " he said			0
" i do n't understand why my sport wishes to place itself in a position to be a catalyst for that			0

@entity1 " *uncomfortable* " with decision to stage race in @entity20
@entity2 driver says it is unlikely the that rescheduled event will go ahead
@entity20 had been **due** to open season in march but was postponed **due** to civil *unrest*
@entity8 chiefs made decision to reinstate the race after visiting the kingdom on tuesday
