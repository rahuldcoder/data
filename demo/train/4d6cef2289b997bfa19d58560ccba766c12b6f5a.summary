@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 forces in southern @entity1 have handed responsibility for security in the @entity10 district of @entity11 to the @entity12 , the @entity4 and @entity5 militaries said monday			1
@entity4 forces have been in @entity10 since 2006			1
the transfer of authority was first announced by the @entity4 defense secretary in july			2
it follows heavy @entity4 losses in the area , a @entity21 stronghold			1
the @entity4 sustained 105 casualties in @entity10 -- roughly a third of all @entity4 deaths in the country , according to lt. @entity26 , a spokesman for the @entity27			2
@entity4 defence secretary @entity28 acknowledged that " the level of sacrifice has been high " in praising the @entity4 mission in " one of the most challenging areas of @entity1			2
" @entity26 described the militants in the area as " very skillful , very organized ( and ) very difficult to combat , " adding that the @entity21 is " very well entrenched " in @entity11			0
@entity36 's @entity27 said the handover was possible because of the increase in the number of @entity5 troops in @entity1			1
@entity41 , a @entity10 resident and a candidate in saturday 's parliamentary election , told @entity2 that residents in the district are happy that the @entity5 is taking over because " they believe that the @entity5 has more decisiveness in the war than the @entity4			1
" @entity41 said that under @entity4 control the security situation worsened , adding that residents are waiting to see whether security improves under @entity5 control			1
" they are waiting to see if the @entity5 can create security , job facilities , opening schools and investment on reconstruction projects , " @entity41 said			0
the switch of command in @entity10 is not a defeat for @entity4 troops , but simply works well militarily , said @entity63 , director of the @entity64 , an independent defense and security think tank in @entity67			1
" it never made much military sense to put troops into the northern areas of @entity10 , @entity73 and @entity74 in the first place , " @entity63 said in july when @entity68 announced the plan			2
" but in 2006 they were sent there at the insistence of [ @entity1 ] president [ @entity81 ] @entity80 , and once established , any pullback would have represented a victory for the @entity21			2
" with the arrival of some 18,000 @entity5 @entity12 in the region by the end of august , it makes sense for the @entity4 troops to reorganize themselves and reinforce their numbers in central @entity11 , @entity63 said			1
it will make the @entity4 force more effective and safer , he said			0
the political fallout of the move , however , is unpredictable , @entity63 said			0
when the @entity95 ended operations in the southern @entity98 city of @entity99 last year , it was under similar circumstances , but still appeared as a " furtive retreat , " he said			0
" the image at home that @entity4 was giving up a job it could no longer handle was impossible to shake off , " @entity63 said			0
" the same may attach to @entity10			0
this war is as much about image and perception as it is about who controls the ground in @entity1			0
" @entity26 emphasized monday that the handover " is in no way the @entity4 backing away from @entity10			1
it 's the redeployment of forces			0
" @entity2 's @entity114 and @entity115 contributed to this report .			0
