-- you 're doing all the obvious things : the right education , solid experience , a good mentor			1
but those in the @entity7 often confide that it 's the subtle " polish " that takes the superstar to the next level of success			1
small differences can make a big impact			1
what affects others ' perception of your ability to lead a project , a division , an organization , or a movement ? consider the following habits , attitudes , skills , and characteristics of a leader to see how you measure up and then determine how you can step up : act with integrity tell the truth			1
practice the principles you preach			1
it takes just one inappropriate action or comment to uncover the counterfeit			1
and once credibility vanishes , regaining it becomes a monumental task			1
people want to see the real you -- the integrity behind your face , the actions behind your promises			1
in today 's economic landscape , trust trumps both price and track record			1

tilt your head slightly to one side			2
the literal message is , " i 'm giving you an ear			2
" ask questions about what the speaker is saying to help clarify thoughts and to verify that you 've heard correctly and have drawn the intended conclusions			2
answer questions specifically rather than vaguely			2
take action to demonstrate that you 've heard			2
@entity70 was right when he observed , " talk to a man about himself and he will listen for hours			2
" the magic in this mix ? he or she will think you are a remarkable person			2
listening increases likeability , and likeability leads back to trust in you as a leader			2
commit to what you communicate follow through			1
if you say you 'll make an introduction to the potential new client , make the introduction			2
if you say you 'll provide the reference , give the reference			2
if you say you 'll fund the project , budget the money			2
show up , own up , and straighten it up			0
in a marketplace of mealy mouthed moochers , doing what you say will absolutely astonish people			0
be accountable for results accountability implies risk and reward			0
you earn rewards for success ; you accept penalties for failure			0
by the very nature of the risk - reward proposition , others ' perception of your position and value increases			0
you 've heard it said that money is not the most important thing in life			0
but that 's easier to believe when you have enough of it to cover your basic needs			0
likewise , people measure competence in different ways , and " enough " competence or " enough " intelligence becomes a matter of degree			0
at some point , people pull you over the " enough " threshold and begin to judge your performance on degrees of results			0
delivering the goods attracts attention and demands respect that translates into others ' perception of your leadership and executive presence			1

you may be credible and have others pick your brain and benefit from your work -- but choose not to be around you if they do n't have to be			0
on the other hand , you may be a likeable , life - of - the - party sort whom everybody wants to hang out with			0
but people may not consider you credible in challenging times for critical information or competent performance			0
the tagline " mover and shaker " comes from a metaphor -- a very visual component of a personality trait or habit			0
not only do leaders move through many networks , work a lot of relationships , and shake their share of hands , they literally take the lead in approaching people			1
people with presence approach others confidently , act as host , make introductions , and connect others in the group			0
they approach and give attention to others			1
leaders put themselves on the frontline to serve			1
as a result , others feel their presence because of the attention they give -- not receive			1
people do pay attention to those with power to reward or punish them			1
but they enjoy being around those who are humble , willing to serve , and give them the proverbial time of day			0
never whine constant complaining characterizes losers			0
the habit follows those who lack success and feel powerless to improve things for themselves			0
by their very act of whining , people are admitting that they lack the competence , character , communication skills , or commitment to improve things			1
not a good message to send			0
follow protocol in mixing business with pleasure because of the heavy demands on their time , leaders blend their social and work lives , often building their personal relationships through business contacts , and vice versa			1
as the old saying goes , people do business with people they like			0
be the liaison who brings people together over lunch , a golf game , committee work , or causes			0
understand the rules of etiquette in each of these situations : introductions ; timing and appropriateness of business topics ; appropriate dress ; who arrives first ; who pays			0
it 's these little things done right that shout " class			0
