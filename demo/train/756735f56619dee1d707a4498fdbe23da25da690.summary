-- during the @entity2 , @entity1 heralded @entity4 's coverage of momentous events in @entity6 in 2011			1
" like it or hate it , it is really effective , " @entity7 said of the network at a congressional hearing while she was secretary of state			0
she went on to decry " a million commercials " and " arguments between talking heads , " and " the kind of stuff that we do on our news that is not providing information to us			2
" the remarks primarily pointed out the growing influence @entity4 was having on @entity24 viewers			0
but behind that , @entity7 's testimony was a top - down critique of @entity24 media			1
" her comments went to the heart of the way the media structure works , " @entity29 , host of @entity0 's " @entity30 , " said			1
and for her , they are again quite relevant			0
@entity1 is thinking about running for president , a candidacy -- and possible administration -- that would no doubt intensify the already close and sometimes sensational scrutiny of her and her husband			1
for @entity48 and @entity1 , their view on the state of journalism in the @entity24 comes from a place of deep knowledge and exposure			1
and like many who have been in the spotlight for a prolonged period , it 's a love - hate thing			2
@entity7 speaks out a focus of national media speculation , debate and fascination for 25 years , their relationship with the press has ebbed and flowed			2
but on the whole , they have long questioned and doubted its motives			0
and over the past two weeks , both @entity66 have let it be known those feelings still exist			1
on wednesday at his alma mater , @entity68 , @entity7 faulted journalists for how they covered policy issues , saying it is " dimly understood " and often " disconnected from the consequences of the policies being implemented " because of journalists			0
@entity7 plays professor , blasts media in @entity68 speech " if a policymaker is a political leader and is covered primarily by the political press , there is a craving that borders on addictive to have a storyline , " said @entity7 as his wife looked on			2
" and then once people settle on the storyline , there is a craving that borders on blindness to shoehorn every fact , every development , everything that happens into the story line , even if it 's not the story			2
" last week , @entity1 leveled an equally biting media critique , telling an audience at the @entity96 that " journalism has changed quite a bit in a way that is not good for the country and not good for journalism			1
" @entity1 : today 's media is more entertainment , less facts " a lot of serious news reporting has become more entertainment driven and more opinion - driven as opposed to factual , " she said			1
" people book onto the shows , political figures , commentators who will be controversial who will be provocative because it 's a good show			2
you might not learn anything but you might be entertained and i think that 's just become an unfortunate pattern that i wish could be broken			2
" common for politicians this feeling among politicians is par for the course , said @entity122 , a longtime @entity7 confidant who attended wednesday 's speech			0
" it is an occupational hazard and it comes with the territory , " said @entity122 , a @entity0 contributor			0
" i do n't think it is any different for him than it was with president @entity128 , president @entity129 or president @entity130			0
" @entity29 echoed that sentiment			0
" if you put ( either of the @entity7 's quotes ) in front of either president @entity129 , they would agree with most of the comments			1
" from @entity137 to draft - dodging allegations to @entity139 , the media spotlight on the @entity66 during their time in the @entity141 was intense , and it affected them			1
for most of the eight years of the @entity7 administration from 1993 - 2001 , the couple and their advisers worried about the " vast right - wing conspiracy " that they feared aimed to take them down			0
according to @entity153 documents released by the @entity154 , those feelings largely stemmed from the rise of the @entity156 and conservative blogs and chat rooms			0
the @entity159 , a longtime @entity7 confidant and friend , kept a detailed diary of her exchanges with the first lady			0
according to @entity164 , whose personal documents gained media attention earlier this year , @entity7 regularly expressed frustration and a deep distrust of the media			0
confidant 's diary : @entity7 wanted to keep records for ' revenge ' in january 1995 , @entity164 wrote that @entity7 expressed " her total exasperation with all this obsession and attention , and how hard she 's finding to conceal her contempt for it all			0
" the most apparent next flashpoint on the relationship between the media and the @entity66 came during @entity1 's 2008 race for the @entity141			1
late into the @entity188 primary process as it became clear that @entity128 had the momentum , the @entity7 campaign 's view of the media began to sour			1
the former president publicly and privately railed against what he called " the most biased coverage in history , " and both @entity66 complained of what they believed to be a pervasive sexism dominating the campaign narrative			1
@entity7 even publicly called one campaign reporter " sleazy " and " a really dishonest reporter			0
" what 's ahead ? now with @entity1 admittedly " thinking " about a 2016 run , the question remains as to how her relationship with the media -- and its deep history -- could affect any campaign			1
@entity29 thinks these latest tweaks of the media could be an attempt to " work the refs			0
" " the @entity66 have been choosing to go there , " concluded @entity29			1
" i do think one partial explanation has to do with any future campaign that we may see from @entity1			2

suspicions of the media by the @entity66 is nothing new
but there 's new relevancy with @entity1 thinking about a @entity141 run
