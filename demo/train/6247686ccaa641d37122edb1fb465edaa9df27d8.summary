-- i wrote a book called " @entity3 is an @entity4			0
" recently i got up at the @entity5 magical hour of 6 a.m. to do radio interviews all over the country to let people know about it			0
i did some interviews with atheist and skeptic podcasts , but the 6 a.m. talks were usually morning radio			0
and morning radio has a lot of theists			0
my book had just come out that day so even jocks who wanted to read it had n't had the time to do more than skim			2
many of the @entity23 saw the words " holiday " and " atheist " and asked me how i felt about " @entity27			0
" @entity28 is usually credited with spreading the panic about this war on @entity31			1
@entity32 talks about atheists and left - wing loons ruining @entity31 for children			1
he also says that @entity36 is a philosophy , which might have seemed like a sleek move on live tv , but ... i 'm thinking he 's noticed by now @entity40 is biting him in the butt			0
@entity32 finds evidence for the war in atheist groups opposing @entity46 scenes on government property and their discomfort with public school students having to opt out when their classes go to a church to see a @entity31 play			1
@entity53 is also ticked off by businesses urging their employees to say " @entity56 " instead of " @entity57			1
" he does n't want the holidays turned secular			2
he wants his @entity31 pure			1
pure as the @entity62 philosophy			2
but he could learn strategy to win the war on @entity31 from the @entity65 and their ' 60s tv show			1
they 're on a reunion tour ( sadly without @entity69 , but miraculously with @entity70			0
) i flew across the country to @entity73 to see them on stage			0
i had promised my 12 - year - old self that i would see them live and i wanted to keep that promise			2
i owe the @entity65 a lot			1
@entity65 got me started on crazy - ass rock ' n ' roll and probably got me started doing my crazy vegas magic show			1
they appealed to the broadest audience possible			0
my mom and dad would watch the @entity65 with me , and other than their stupid haircuts , @entity84 and @entity85 were n't bothered much by the @entity89			1
opinion : what 's really behind ' war on @entity31 ' @entity84 bought me @entity65 records			1
i read @entity65 interviews and through them , learned about a guy named @entity97 who was their opening act in cities i could n't get to			1
i saw @entity101 of the @entity102 on the @entity65 tv show and in their movie , " head , " and soon i 'd moved from the innocuous to full blown dangerous rock ' n ' roll			1
things that are for everyone sometimes suck us into things that are n't for everyone			2
think about it , @entity53			0
many people wanted to keep rock ' n ' roll pure			1
hardcore fans scoffed at the @entity65			1
they wanted to ensure electric guitars were only for rebels , but the @entity65 got the feeling and beat out there to the children			1
and some of us , after feeling the beat and digging the feeling , kept going all the way , far out			0
@entity65 were an entry to rock ' n ' roll as rebellious as it could get			1
" @entity56 " could do the same thing			2
if @entity62 philosophers get together and include all @entity129 in their holiday , if they do n't exclude any children , if they can start with everyone loving the season , maybe the reason for it will sneak in -- like @entity97 's " @entity135 " riding the @entity65 ' " last train to @entity137			1
" maybe the sanitized tiding of comfort and joy will lead people all the way to @entity36			0
there are many ways to proselytize			0
you could let the crucified @entity146 ride in on @entity148 's sleigh			0
maybe @entity62 can slalom down that slippery slope			0
that might be too manipulative and cynical for @entity32			2
he might not want his @entity36 philosophy to ride in on anything			0
@entity53 might prefer that one becomes a @entity62 first and then celebrates the season after earning it			0
i can see that point of view			0
that 's a noble point of view : that @entity36 and atheism should compete fairly in the marketplace of ideas			0
maybe i should have started with @entity97 and @entity101 or not gotten into rock ' n ' roll at all			2
that is the high road and i can respect that			0
but , wanting all children to enjoy the holiday season , with no child left out of the fun , does n't seem like a position that 's deserving of the term " war			1
" how about we spend some time this holiday season wishing that more of our wars will be waged like the atheist war on @entity31 ? the wars in the @entity177 , waged mostly by members of the @entity180 religions , kill a lot of people			1
the war on @entity31 has killed no one			1
the war on drugs kills many innocent bystanders and wastes a lot of money putting citizens in expensive prisons			0
@entity129 atheists are accused of a war that injures no one and saves all of us money and seems to promote real @entity129 values			2
let 's either fight all wars like that or use a different term			0
could n't we at least call it " the honest disagreement about the @entity31 philosophy ? " we 're too busy singing , to put anybody down			1
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity209 .			2

@entity28 ' @entity32 says left - wing loons are waging war on @entity31 , ruining it for kids
@entity209 says the @entity65 were his entry drug to real , hardcore rock ' n ' roll
*jillette* : could @entity65 be a strategy ? " @entity56 " as entry to " pure @entity31 " ?
meanwhile , he says , ca n't we just call it " the honest disagreement about @entity31 ? "
