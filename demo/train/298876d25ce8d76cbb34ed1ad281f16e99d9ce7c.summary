would you click on that headline ? when you give your @entity7 a bland label instead of a vibrant , compelling headline , you might as well slap " do n't read this " on the top of your story			1
you have to give readers a reason to spend their time on your submission			2
a good headline on the mainpage at @entity5 can be the difference between 200 clicks and 200,000 or more			1
so what works and what does n't ? here are some tips for writing that perfect , click - worthy headline : paint a picture no : @entity37 playground scare yes : playground erupts in flames a playground scare could be a flasher in a trench coat			1
it could be a splintery teeter - totter			2
but a playground erupting in flames ? that 's a click magnet			1
be specific no : dog nurses kitten yes : rottweiler nurses kitten before you know the breed , you might be interested			0
once you know it 's a rottweiler with a little kitty , you just have to see it			1
putting interesting details in headlines is a good way of enticing the reader			2
but not too specific no : food shortages in @entity64 yes : @entity66 ' shelves stripped bare do n't limit your audience by being hyper - local			0
tap into the universal appeal of your subject by avoiding too - specific information			0
hook the reader with a memorable detail no : curb appeal lost on neighbors yes : 26 - toilet mansion planned what makes your @entity78 a must - watch ? what detail of the story kept you talking ? tease and tantalize the reader with those catchy specifics			2
if you can throw in a number , all the better , because that gives an idea of the magnitude of the situation			0
and people like numbers in general			0
use common words no : @entity92 yes : naked no : suds yes : beer using slang will limit your audience			0
a reader wo n't spend time decoding your cleverness			0
if they do n't get the headline right away , you will lose their attention			0
verbs good ; labels bad no : mortgage meltdown yes : 300,000 lose homes to banks the first words of your headline should be compelling to draw interest , but then the verb is a call for readers to take action and watch			0
do n't skimp on nice , juicy words and vivid images			0
it 's the difference between " @entity120 tornado " and " tornado deposits car atop house			2
" deliver on your promises if your headline is " bull leaps into stands , runs amok , " they better be able to see the bull midair , in the ring , and people scattering			0
do n't tease to something that is n't there			0
