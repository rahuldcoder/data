on @entity1 , marijuana enthusiasts rejoiced as @entity2 and @entity3 legalized marijuana			2
( ballot initiatives in @entity6 and a medical initiative in @entity8 did not fare so well			2
) from the federal government 's perspective , however , marijuana remains illegal			1
it is anyone 's guess what the @entity16 administration 's next move will be , but it is important to understand that this president has long stated his opposition to marijuana legalization			1
when it came to medical marijuana expansion in several states , @entity16 's @entity22 sent out strongly worded letters warning that even medical marijuana was in " violation of federal law regardless of state laws permitting such activities " and that " this includes prosecution of business enterprises that unlawfully market and sell marijuana			1
" why the opposition to marijuana legalization in the first place ? first , we know that legalization would dramatically decrease the price of marijuana and increase use , according to a 2010 study from the @entity43			1
and today 's marijuana is not the marijuana of the 1960s ; potency has tripled in the past 15 years , according to a 2009 report from the @entity50 government			2
this is not reefer madness thinking			2
high - potency marijuana has contributed to addiction for one out of six kids who start using it in their teens , direct iq loss ( an 8 - point loss among kids using regularly ) , car crashes , and mental illness			1
many who support legalization have claimed that we could control marijuana use , especially among teens , if only we regulated it through legalization			1
sadly , however , the provisions passed in @entity2 and @entity3 do everything but control marijuana			2
if these state laws were enacted , in fact , we could face a major industry commercializing and promoting marijuana to kids			1
as we know from alcohol and tobacco , even when age limits are in place , getting people hooked young is a key long - term strategy for profiteers			0
indeed @entity83 , for one , has long been perched and ready to make some serious cash from marijuana sales : according to internal documents released during its historic court settlement , in smoking 's heyday , @entity83 considered marijuana legalization a golden opportunity			1
opinion : @entity50 should honor states ' new pot laws " the use of marijuana ... has important implications for the tobacco industry in terms of an alternative product line			1
( we ) have the land to grow it , the machines to roll it and package it , the distribution to market it			1
in fact , some firms have registered trademarks , which are taken directly from marijuana street jargon			0
these trade names are used currently on little - known legal products , but could be switched if and when marijuana is legalized			0
estimates indicate that the market in legalized marijuana might be as high as $ 10 billion annually , " said a report commissioned by cigarette manufacturer @entity118 ( now merged with @entity119 ) in the 1970s			1
if increased use and addiction might be unwelcome results of legalization , what hoped - for results might not materialize ? many have already begun touting tax revenues from legal marijuana as a major plus of the recently passed state laws			1
sadly , however , we know that vice taxes rarely pay for themselves			0
the $ 40 billion we collect annually from high levels of tobacco and alcohol use in the @entity50 are about a tenth of what those use levels cost us in terms of lost productivity , premature illness , accidents and death			0
additionally , our experience with many state lotteries has shown that promised funding for schools falls well short of expectations			0
as the @entity157 said recently : " although the public still perceives the lottery as making a significant difference in the funds available for education , it is a minor source that can not be expected to provide major improvements in k - 12 education			0
" school officials are not happy about this : " we thought that it would be a windfall , " said @entity161 , executive director of the @entity162			2
" the general public -- they were fooled by this			0
" opinion : the end of the war on marijuana we also know that the promise of ending violent cartels is far from reality			0
a recent @entity175 report showed that @entity177 drug trafficking groups only received a minority of their revenue from marijuana			0
so they are likely to stay around , legal marijuana or not			0
voters have been sold a false dichotomy : " you can either stick with failed , current policies , or you can try a ' new approach ' with legalization			1
" sadly , this kind of black - and - white thinking betrays the fact that there are better ways than legalization or prohibition to deal with this complex issue			2
legalization may not be the answer , but that also means that former users with an arrest record should not be prevented from getting a job or accessing social benefits			2
we need to have an adult conversation about marijuana arrests among disadvantaged communities , too , to ensure equal justice under the law			0
increased education and treatment will work better than incarceration and a sole reliance on the criminal justice system			0
indeed , we can reform the worst part of our current laws without increasing rates of addiction and harms			1
let 's think before we legalize			0
follow us on @entity220 .			0

@entity222 : pot still illegal from a federal perspective , despite laws in some states
he says @entity16 *adminstration* has been clear on this : pot carries serious *health* *dangers*
he says legalization does *n't* bring tax windfall states imagine ; @entity83 eager to market pot
@entity222 : we must fix worst part of current laws , like *penalties* , without upping addiction rates
