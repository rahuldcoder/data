-- why are @entity2 politicians dragging their feet while @entity5 militants fortify their foothold across the country ? @entity2 's lawmakers are simply not going to " let a war get in the way of their political disputes , " as one expert succinctly put it last week			1
and while the country burns , her politicians remain deadlocked on who to appoint to key government posts following april 's national elections			1
@entity2 's new parliament convened for the first time on july 1 to elect a new speaker , but the session quickly descended into bickering between members of different parties and had to be rescheduled for july 8			1
but little changed in the ensuing week -- and with all sides failing to reach agreement on who to appoint to the key posts of speaker , president and prime minister , the session was delayed again , until this weekend			1
@entity2 's political paralysis , even in the face of a threat as grave as @entity5 ' sweep across huge swathes of the country , is a sign of just how difficult an agreement will be to reach			1
at the heart of the political problem lies incumbent prime minister @entity46			1
his coalition secured a plurality of votes in the general elections , winning almost three times as many seats as the closest rival			0
but a third term for @entity46 , a @entity55 , is a red line for @entity58 , @entity59 and even rival @entity55 parties			1
more opinion : is @entity61 the only hope for peace ? if @entity46 's support is melting away , as it appears to be , why wo n't he just step down ? @entity46 's intransigence may reflect a desire to ensure that his choice to succeed him -- his former chief of staff , who many believe is the most viable alternative candidate -- will be nominated without much resistance from the other political parties			1
" show him death and he will accept a fever " is an @entity2 proverb that helps explain @entity46 's insistence on remaining in power			1
@entity46 wants to exert enough pressure to ensure that the next government is formed on his terms even if he 's not at the head of it			1
this may include a seat on the @entity87 council as a deputy , but it will certainly include a guarantee that he will not be prosecuted if he steps down			0
@entity46 's @entity55 rivals ca n't dictate the terms of the next government formation process because they face an uncomfortable reality : the @entity55 may have a majority in the new parliament , but the @entity46 contingent has the vast majority of seats within that bloc			2
he may be excluded from heading the next government but his bloc can not be ignored			0

@entity2 's @entity58 politicians may have been directly elected by the people , but the masked men of @entity5 -- many of whom are foreigners -- are the ones who now hold sway in much of western and northwestern @entity2			1
many @entity58 are flirting with the revolutionaries that want a complete overthrow of the current order because that order -- built on an ethno - sectarian model -- handicaps @entity58 , given their minority status			2
but changing the status quo is a red line for the @entity55 because it has brought them to the helm of power for the first time in @entity2 's modern history			1
the collapse of the political order is as much a red line for the @entity55 as it is for neighboring @entity61 , which enjoys close ties with their @entity55 allies in @entity137			0
what to do in the face of this deadlock ? the best - case scenario now would be a speedy government formation that leads to a greater decentralization of power whilst maintaining the territorial integrity of @entity2			2
after 2010 's general election it took nine months of horse - trading to get the various @entity58 , @entity59 and @entity55 parties to agree on how best to divide the spoils of state amongst themselves			2
now , there is recognition that @entity2 does not have the luxury of dithering			0
@entity5 insurgents will continue wreaking havoc in @entity2 because they do not believe in the democratic process			2
but if the @entity58 political parties can buy in to the new government , it will take the air out of the insurgency and prove to the militants that politics can indeed work to secure more rights and privileges			2
the worst - case scenario would be the de facto splitting up of @entity2			0
there is a " vital " @entity2 that @entity61 and the @entity55 will fight to protect			0
this includes @entity137 , the city of @entity173 to the north , the province of @entity176 to the east and all nine @entity55 - dominated provinces in the south			0
@entity61 - backed @entity55 militias have already mobilized to confront the insurgents and they will likely lead the efforts to secure this vital @entity2			0
if the political process fails yet again , the @entity55 would likely be willing to cede vast amounts of @entity58 - dominated territory and the @entity59 - controlled province of @entity187 in exchange for unrivaled supremacy in @entity137 and the strategic oil - producing province of @entity191 in the south			0
@entity2 is on the brink of abyss again			0
its leaders must act quickly			0
