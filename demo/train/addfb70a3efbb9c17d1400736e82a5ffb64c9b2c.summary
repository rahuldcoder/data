@entity0 -- a year ago , president @entity2 was under fire			1
today , he is being feted			0
in just 12 months , the 51 - year - old lawyer and former @entity6 senator raised by a single mother went from a beleaguered candidate for re-election -- his record and signature health care law under daily attack by @entity15 rivals -- to being the first @entity16 to win more than 50 % of a presidential vote twice since @entity18			2
now the nation 's first @entity20 - @entity6 president is @entity1 's @entity22 of 2012 , as voted on by readers of @entity1 , five days after being named @entity24			1
second most intriguing : @entity25 : the girl the @entity27 wanted dead explaining @entity30 's choice , executive editor @entity28 cited @entity2 " for finding and forging a new majority , for turning weakness into opportunity and for seeking , amid great adversity , to create a more perfect union			1
" @entity30 such accolades and results seemed improbable a year ago when @entity2 's approval rating hovered in the low 40s while unemployment was 8.5 %			1
history showed that it was rare , if not unprecedented , for an incumbent to win re-election with such figures			0
in december 2011 , @entity2 's signature health care reform law faced a @entity48 challenge and unrelenting criticism from @entity15 , especially conservatives who depicted it as a socialism - inspired government takeover of almost 20 % of the @entity6 economy			1
in addition , a fierce political battle with congressional @entity15 over taxes and spending dominated headlines that month			0
it was the latest in a series of fiscal showdowns that already caused an unprecedented downgrade in the @entity6 credit rating earlier in the year			0
despite ordering the mission that took out @entity66 in may 2011 and welcoming home the last combat troops from @entity69 seven months later , the president faced questions from some critics about his plan to end @entity74 combat operations in 2014			0
@entity66 killing caps decade - long manhunt meanwhile , the upcoming election primary season focused attention on the @entity15 presidential race , spiced by frequent debates that gave candidates ample opportunity to tee off on @entity2 's record			1
his detractors labeled him a failure and said he was over his head , unable to understand the still sluggish economy recovering from recession , let alone how to strengthen it			0
a year later , @entity2 has parlayed his bad hand into a jackpot result			1
@entity2 takes key battlegrounds to win re-election the economy , which had just started to hint at consistent recovery toward the end of 2011 , continued to strengthen incrementally through 2012 , with the unemployment rate falling to 7.7 % in november			1
@entity97 : unemployment rate falls to lowest level since 2008 such steady , albeit slow growth provided cover for @entity2 against the @entity15 attack line that his push for stimulus spending in response to the recession he inherited amounted to wasted money and failed policy			1
while buffeted at times by @entity110 's deficit and currency woes , an overall perception of growing economic stability was a major reason @entity2 defeated @entity15 challenger @entity115 in november by more than 4 million votes			2
perhaps equally beneficial was the @entity48 's june ruling that the @entity118 did n't violate the @entity119 , ending a litany of legal challenges and giving the controversial measure an important public affirmation			0
while @entity115 campaigned on repealing the health care law if elected , the @entity48 decision strengthened @entity2 's ability to tout the benefits of the reforms to avoid the issue becoming an election liability			1
@entity48 on health care : how justices voted the president also made foreign policy a campaign strength over @entity115 , a former governor with little experience on international issues			2
@entity2 touted the @entity66 mission and how he kept his 2008 campaign pledge to end the @entity140 while also starting to wind down the @entity6 military role in @entity74			2
during the final months of the election campaign , @entity2 also recovered the message and personal style that catapulted him to his historic victory four years earlier			2
shouting himself hoarse at times on the trail , he cast himself as the champion of equal opportunity and closing a widening wealth gap in the country			0
his campaign also benefited from key policy moves by the president			2
the administration halted deportations of some children of illegal immigrants , ensuring overwhelming support from the growing @entity162 - @entity6 community that proved vital on @entity163			0
an earlier step to end the " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy that barred openly gay and lesbian people from military service as well his eventual support for same - sex marriage boosted his standing with younger @entity6 -- another key demographic			0
@entity2 announces he supports same - sex marriage as the end of his first term approached , @entity2 's approval rating topped 50 % , and polls showed the public consistently favoring his approach on deficit reduction over @entity15 positions			1
" this one 's more satisfying than ' 08 , " he told top aides on @entity163 , according to the @entity184 cover story on his being named @entity24			1
" it was n't just about what i was going to do as president			0
it 's what i 've done			0

president @entity2 's year of triumph ends with accolade from @entity1 readers
@entity2 also is @entity184 's @entity24
the year began with @entity2 in a *perilous* political position
his re-election *reflected* policy and political *accomplishments*
