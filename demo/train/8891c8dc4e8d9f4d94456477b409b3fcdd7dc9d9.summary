@entity0 -- the presidential campaigns are smashing fundraising records but , with less than two months before @entity7 , the size of their already bloated coffers will become less important than how that money is spent			1
strategists and fundraisers from both parties agree the @entity13 and @entity14 campaigns will have plenty of cash to see them through what @entity18 strategist and @entity1 contributor @entity19 calls " the most important stretch of the election			1
" the @entity13 campaign has raised approximately $ 755 million so far and the @entity14 camp has totaled more than $ 710 million , according to @entity26 records and figures released by the campaigns			1
president @entity13 , who just announced a massive television buy in the key battleground state of @entity31 , is close to matching his historic in 2008 fundraising , while @entity14 has nearly doubled what sen. @entity33 raised in a losing effort			1
" [ neither ] side is going to have a significant financial advantage over the other , " said @entity36 , a @entity37 strategist and senior vice president at @entity39 adding that the money issue is overblown at this point			1
former @entity46 chairman @entity45 said the same thing			1
" both sides are going to have the sufficient funds to get their message out , " said @entity45			0
how will they do it ? @entity36 suggests that not only will television fundraising be important , but online advertising will play an important role in the election , more so than in 2008			1
" that 's where you have a bit of a difference , more of an opportunity than you had in the past elections , " said @entity36			0
@entity13 campaign prepared to unleash huge @entity31 ad buy @entity13 's @entity67 page shows 28.4 million " likes , " while @entity14 's page has a little more than 6.7 million			1
however , the number of people " talking about " the candidates is about equal at 3 million			0
when it comes to social media , the reach is broad , @entity36 says and it 's anyone 's game			0
" it 's really more up for grabs than anybody thinks , " said @entity36			0
" this could make a difference especially when you 're adept at reaching out online through social media in the individual states			2
" @entity14 hits harder as poll shows @entity13 bounce and it also costs less			1
" money spent online is a fraction of what you spend on television , " said @entity36			1
still , the campaigns are hitting the battleground states hard with television ad buys			2
just after the @entity97 ended in @entity98 , the @entity14 campaign announced an ad buy that targets the same eight battleground states that the @entity13 campaign targeted with their $ 77 million buy in early august			1
those states -- @entity104 , @entity31 , @entity105 , @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity108 , @entity109 and @entity110 -- are all toss - ups on @entity1 's @entity112			0
it is in tv advertising that some political strategists suggest @entity14 could outspend and silence the @entity13 campaign in october			1
@entity116 going up with @entity118 re-election ads in @entity119 @entity120 changing roles the @entity122 released fundraising numbers this week that showed it outraised the @entity14 camp by $ 3 million this month - $ 114 million to $ 111 million			1
although the two campaigns are neck - in - neck , their spending puts them behind in cash - on - hand at the end of july according to @entity26 filings			2
the @entity14 campaign revealed it has $ 165.8 million cash - on - hand earlier this week , but the @entity13 campaign is not expected to release its numbers until right before the federal filing deadline in late september			1
when it comes to @entity136 dollars , @entity18 trail the @entity37 by a wide margin			0
@entity138 are independent groups that raise money from businesses , labor groups and individuals and have no spending limits			2
but they must operate independently of the campaigns , meaning they can not coordinate their ad buys			2
@entity148 mayor @entity120 , president @entity13 's former chief of staff who orchestrated the 2006 @entity18 takeover of the @entity118 in 2006 , recently announced that he was moving to @entity150 , the @entity18 ' largest @entity136			1
@entity120 talked about his decision on @entity1 's " @entity152 " last week : " the question is would i be more helpful to the president 's reelection as co-chair of the campaign or helping priorities , " @entity120 told @entity1 's @entity153 last week			2
" and not his campaign , but his efforts			0
and so i am going to try to help him			0
" @entity120 's move , to some , signaled weakness in @entity18 @entity138 , which were slow to attract donations after @entity13 dismissed them last year and called them a " threat to our democracy			1
" his campaign reversed its decision with a campaign official saying in february : " we will not unilaterally disarm			0
" " [ @entity120 's move ] is not a sign [ @entity18 are in trouble with their fundraising ] ; it is a @entity181 catastrophe , " said @entity175 , a @entity37 strategist and @entity1 contributor			2
but @entity45 said not to read too much into @entity120 's move			0
dems get boost as both parties seek to leverage conventions " they want to raise sufficient funds to block what they 're bragging about on the other side and he has the ability to go out and raise large checks , he did it , " said @entity45 , referring to the 2006 mid-term election			0
@entity18 fundraisers insist they are not concerned going forward			0
" we 've known from the beginning that @entity202 , the @entity203 and other right - wing special interests would outspend us , " @entity19 said , referencing the billionaire brothers who have written large checks to @entity201			0
" but we have to be competitive			0
" @entity18 strategists say that they have the money they need to win in november			2
" if you look at , we 're playing in a basket of eight to ten states , that 's it , " @entity45 said			0
" this money is going to go a long way in eight to ten states			0
" and coming off of a successful convention with a bump in the polls , @entity45 is confident that democrats are poised again to take the @entity118 even without the money			0
" i would much rather be president @entity13 today than governor @entity14 , " said @entity45 .			1

@entity13 , @entity14 campaigns smashing fundraising records
campaigns will have enough money to see them through the election , political strategists agree
online targeting will get out the vote more this year than in 2008
