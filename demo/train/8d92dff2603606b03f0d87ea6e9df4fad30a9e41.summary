@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 broke into tears monday as a judge read potential jurors the indictment accusing the @entity1 mother of killing her 2 - year - old daughter and then lying to law enforcement authorities			1
the emotional display came during the first day of jury selection in the trial of the 25 - year - old @entity14 , who is charged with capital murder in the death of her daugher , @entity3			1
she also faces six other charges , including aggravated child abuse , aggravated manslaughter of a child and misleading law enforcement			0
monday 's proceedings occurred in a @entity0 , @entity1 , courthouse , about 100 miles southwest of @entity26 where @entity3 's grandmother first reported her missing in 2008 -- weeks after the girl was last seen , and five months before her body was found			1
authorities moved the proceedings there hoping to draw from a jury pool that was less likely to have seen and been influenced by the intense media coverage surrounding the case			2
they kept the site in @entity39 location secret until monday morning , hoping to minimize the media rush in the area from which citizens will decide @entity14 's fate			2
once jury selection is complete , the jurors will be transported back to @entity26 's @entity46 for the trial , which is now scheduled to start may 17			1
the major question posed monday by @entity46 superior court chief judge @entity49 to the 66 jurors who came before him was whether they 'd be able to remain sequestered in @entity26 for up to eight weeks for the trial			1
more citizens will be called into court tuesday and perhaps beyond			0
" our system of justice depends on people like you willing to serve , " the judge said			0
" you are being asked to perform one of the highest duties of citizenship			0
" of those called monday , 45 were excused			1
the 21 who were not -- 14 men and 7 women -- will be called back wednesday			0
@entity49 allowed the dozens of men and women to go home for various reasons			0
many cited financial hardship -- saying they or their family would suffer if they could n't work for two months			0
others said they had to take care of loved ones			0
one man said he was active - duty military , about to ship out to @entity80 for his @entity82 responsibility			0
monday was the first phase in the jury selection process			1
the other phases include asking jurors , one by one , for their take on the death penalty , which @entity3 would be eligible for if convicted on the murder charge			1
lastly , the jurors will be quizzed on their knowledge of the case and other positions -- including if they have an opinion , prior to the trial , on @entity14 's guilt or innocence			0
throughout the selection process , @entity49 can weigh arguments from members of @entity14 's legal team and state prosecutors and decide to exclude certain men and women from the jury pool			2
besides winnowing down the jury pool , @entity49 also issued several decisions monday that were all setbacks for the defense			2
that included denying @entity14 's lawyers motion for more time to prepare for the trial , as well as questioning whether there was enough racial and ethnic diversity in the potential jury pool gathered in @entity0			1
perhaps the most significant ruling came when , in a written order , @entity49 determined the jury can consider evidence about an alleged " decompositional " odor coming from @entity3 's trunk , and hear from certain expert witnesses			1
the defense had knocked the analysis as unreliable and too closely tied to the @entity124 , suggesting it could be prejudiced against their client			0
the judge conceded the @entity14 trial could be the first time the " chemical signature of the odor of human decomposition or the identity of the volatile chemical components of human decomposition " might be considered during a trial in @entity1			1
still , he wrote , " the expert 's testimony will assist the jury in understanding the evidence and in determining facts in the case			2
" in @entity144 's @entity143 contributed to this report .			0

new : of the 66 potential jurors called monday , 45 are excused
new : the judge rules evidence on " decompositional " odor can be considered
jury selection is secretly moved to @entity0 , 100 miles from @entity26
