@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 came to @entity1 this week hoping to win over the kind of conservative hardliners who turned on him last year as the @entity8 immigration reform bill he sponsored hit a roadblock in the @entity12 - controlled @entity11			1
by the time @entity3 addressed a massive @entity12 fundraiser here on monday evening , it was n't his right flank he had to worry about			1
the @entity18 senator and likely presidential candidate was the headline speaker at a " @entity28 " barbecue fundraiser for rep. @entity22 , the @entity23 - backed congressman who represents what many republicans consider the most conservative @entity11 district in the state			1
after a succession of speeches from @entity1 @entity12 notables like sen. @entity32 and gov. @entity33 , @entity3 took the stage in @entity0 to applause , but was quickly interrupted by a group of protestors -- self - identified @entity38 , young immigrants brought to the country illegally as minors -- who loudly heckled the senator for abandoning last year 's sweeping immigration package when it was met with harsh resistance on the right			1
for an ambitious @entity12 looking to prove his conservative bona fides and rub out the stain of working with @entity51 and @entity52 , the interruption was something of a gift			1
a plugged - in @entity12 operative turned to a reporter and observed dryly , " i could n't think of a better way to make @entity3 look good in @entity1			1
" the audience of nearly 1,200 conservatives jeered the protestors as @entity3 waited for them to be escorted out of the @entity61 , scolding them in the process			1
" we are a sovereign country that deserves to have immigration laws , " @entity3 said			1
" you 're doing harm to your own cause because you do n't have a right to illegally immigrate to the @entity69			2
" the crowd cheered him on			2
one elderly audience member shoved a protester as he weaved his way through the tables			2
another , 73 - year old @entity77 veteran @entity76 , angrily stalked them out of the building , clutching his cane as if it were a baseball bat			2
" i let my temper get the better of me , " @entity76 said after the incident			2
" but there was no place for that kind of thing			2
if you do n't want to hear what he has to say , do n't come			2
" @entity3 plunges into immigration debate the remainder of @entity3 's speech cemented his standing with the deeply @entity12 crowd			1
a member of the @entity8 foreign relations and intelligence committees , @entity3 has championed a muscular foreign policy and tapped hawkish neoconservative thinkers as his foreign policy advisers			2
he spent much of the evening lambasting president @entity101 's handling of overseas affairs , from the @entity103 to @entity104			2
" if you want to know the state of the world today , it is chaos , " he said			2
he pivoted to cultural issues , blasting tax laws that discourage marriage and a culture that regards divorce as no big deal			0
" the most important job we have is not congressman or senator or governor , " he said			1
" it 's family and mother and husband and wife			0
" though several attendees said they had lingering questions about his immigration stance and wanted to hear more from him in the coming months , most of the @entity12 who spoke to @entity2 complimented his speech			1
" that crowd was with him 100 % , " said @entity130 , a longtime member of the @entity131			0
@entity133 , though , cautioned that she was open to supporting other potential @entity12 presidential candidates , naming @entity135 and even former @entity12 nominee @entity136 as possible choices			1
@entity22 , who fiercely opposed @entity3 's immigration efforts in 2013 , said the senator " will have to explain " his position to @entity140 if he seeks the @entity12 nomination			1
but @entity22 had kind words for the man who graced his fundraiser			1
" @entity3 believes in faith and freedom , " he said			0
@entity32 , a fellow hawk in the @entity8 , was more generous in his remarks			0
he described @entity3 as " the son of @entity151 when it comes to national security			0
" just as important as @entity3 's public appearance were the carefully - curated private meetings that his advisers arranged prior to the dinner speech			1
@entity1 back in 2016 spotlight in his first trip to @entity1 since addressing a @entity12 fundraiser in @entity161 two summers ago , @entity3 spent the day in a series of closed - door sessions with influential local activists and potential financial backers , specifically courting the @entity168 conservatives who dominate grassroots @entity12 politics in the @entity1 upstate			1
@entity3 advisers organized a meeting for the senator with senior officials from @entity175 , making @entity3 the first @entity12 presidential contender to cultivate leaders at the famed @entity168 university			1
he also entertained questions from over 40 social conservatives at the @entity182 home of @entity183 , the well - connected president of @entity184			1
@entity185 , the host of a drive - time christian talk radio show that broadcasts throughout the upstate , said @entity3 spoke for 10 minutes about " bedrock conservative values " while at @entity190 's home , stressing his opposition to same - sex marriage , before taking questions			0
@entity194 said he was " very moved " by @entity3 's remarks , comparing the 43 - year old @entity196 to @entity151			0
" i was very impressed with his grasp of the issues , " @entity194 said			0
" but the thing that impressed me most was his optimism and belief in @entity69 , the kind that i first heard from @entity151 when i was a kid in college			1
that 's what i 've been searching for			0
that 's something that 's missing in conservative messaging today			0
" @entity3 , too , held a @entity182 fundraiser for his political operation , @entity212 , which has so far spent half a million dollars on behalf of @entity12 candidates in 2014			1
the event attracted donors and business leaders from around the state , as well as another member of the @entity1 congressional delegation , rep. @entity218			0
still , @entity3 brushed off questions about his presidential aspirations in a session with reporters , giving them a pat answer about waiting until after the midterms before making a decision about a @entity11 run			1
he did take a moment to bash @entity230 , the putative @entity231 frontrunner			0
" she is responsible for at least four of the six yeas of this disastrous foreign policy , " he said			0
" she was the secretary of state , the chief foreign policy officer of the @entity101 administration at a time when it is now universally accepted that his policy is a fiasco			0
" that comment drew a feisty retort from @entity242 allies , who accused @entity3 of pandering to " right - wing extremists			0
" " he flip - flopped on his own immigration bill to keep them satisfied , thinks minimum wage does n't work and said @entity251 and @entity252 ' weakened us as a people , ' " said @entity245 , spokeswoman for the @entity247 super pac correct @entity246			1
" americans are looking for a leader like @entity230 to unite us , increase mobility and move our country forward			0
" as for the immigration flare - up earlier in the evening , @entity3 stuck to his guns , saying that a path to legal status for undocumented immigrants is impossible without first securing the border and then re-structuring the current immigration system			1
" i do n't know of anyone in @entity268 who has taken more criticism for supporting elements of what they are asking for , " he said			0
" but what they are asking for and insisting upon is unrealistic			0
this notion that we are going to pass some kind of blanket amnesty is not realistic			0
" outside the civic center , one of the immigration hecklers -- @entity282 , @entity283 , resident @entity284 -- promised to hound @entity3 with similar protests wherever he goes			2
@entity284 , a member of the @entity286 , a group that works to halt immigrant deportations , scoffed at the notion that @entity3 could win over @entity290 voters if he secures the @entity12 nomination			1
" he wants people like me to be deported , " @entity284 said			0
" he does n't stand with our community			0
we want people to know that			0
wherever he goes , we will let him know that			0
" with @entity298 divided , @entity101 to go his own way on immigration			2

the @entity18 senator is a likely candidate for the @entity12 presidential nomination
he was a speaker at the " @entity28 " barbecue fundraiser monday night
group of @entity38 heckled him during his speech
conservatives liked what they heard , but want him to explain his views on immigration
