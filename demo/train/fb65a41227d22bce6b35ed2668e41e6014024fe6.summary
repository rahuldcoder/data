@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 president @entity3 , meeting with @entity1 president @entity6 in @entity0 on thursday , said he will send envoy @entity7 to @entity8 next month for bilateral talks on dismantling @entity11 's nuclear program			1
" if @entity8 is prepared to take concrete and irreversible steps to fulfill its obligations and eliminate its nuclear weapons program , the @entity4 will support economic assistance and help promote its full integration into the community of nations , " @entity3 said			2
" that opportunity and respect will not come with threats			0
@entity8 must live up to its obligations			0
" @entity7 's trip is slated for december 8			1
" convincing @entity8 to give up their nuclear program , it is not a simple matter , " according to @entity6 , who said there 's no deadline , at the joint news conference with @entity3			2
" it 's not going to be easy , but i believe it is possible that we can resolve this issue peacefully			0
" the development comes at the end of the @entity4 president 's tour of @entity39 , which included stops in @entity41 , @entity42 and @entity43 before his visit to @entity1			0
in recent weeks @entity8 has sought direct talks with the @entity4 in what @entity4 officials saw as a possible re-entry to full negotiations with the @entity4 and other countries over ending @entity11 's nuclear program			1
a @entity7 mission had already been announced , but a date was not previously mentioned publicly			0
the @entity4 has been careful to describe the trip as only a limited diplomatic foray and one not designed to replace the fuller negotiations			1
" from our standpoint , the purpose will be to facilitate the early resumption of the six - party talks , " @entity57 said at a @entity59 briefing last week			2
the so - called six - party talks on @entity8 's nuclear program had come to a standstill			1
but the @entity69 trip could lead to new negotiations between @entity8 and the @entity4 , @entity1 , @entity41 and @entity71 and @entity43			2
" we are very realistic about our expectations , " he said			0
" we come to this meeting prepared to engage @entity8 in the context of the six - party talks , but obviously the bottom line here is that @entity8 has to take affirmative steps toward denuclearization			1
that remains our core objective			0
