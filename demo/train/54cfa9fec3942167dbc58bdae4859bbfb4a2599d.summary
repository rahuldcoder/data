-- @entity2 's divisive @entity1 -- which supporters claim protected religious freedom , and critics say served as cover for businesses to discriminate against gays and lesbians -- did n't come from nowhere			1
it took time to hash out among both state lawmakers and interest groups			1
in this case , advocates from the @entity16 -- whose website says it " coordinates legal efforts ( for ) @entity20 legal and policy organizations " all across the @entity21 and in 31 countries -- were among those who played a part in crafting the legislation			0
but from where , or from whom , did the impetus come ? and who paid for the @entity2 push and similar ones in a host of other states ? @entity21 may never know			1
the reason has to do partly with the often collaborative , coordinated way that legislation takes shape			0
numerous players inside and outside government , and based inside and outside of @entity2 , helped make it happen			1
some of them spoke publicly ; others worked behind the scenes			0
plus , it takes money to coordinate and spread such a message and legislative proposals nationwide			0
good luck tracking such funds , given the ways that groups -- known as 501c4s -- can pop up overnight , spend money on causes and campaigns ( without disclosing their donors ) , then disappear			0
" because there are holes in the disclosure regime , " said @entity56 from @entity59 law school 's @entity57 , " there are things that we just do n't know			1
" efforts under way in at least 14 states other states have proposed legislation aimed at protecting what their authors call " religious freedom			1
" some essentially use identical language			0
for instance bills in @entity2 , @entity78 and @entity79 all contain these words : " ' exercise of religion ' means the practice or observance of religion ... including the ability to act or refusal to act in a manner substantially motivated by a ... religious belief			1
" this congruence is n't a coincidence			0
it 's not uncommon for legislation born one place to be copied -- sometimes word - for - word -- somewhere else			2
state - by - state breakdown of ' religious freedom ' initiatives but absent explicit proof , it 's hard to say that one person or one donor is behind any such effort			1
as the head of the conservative @entity110 's @entity109 program , @entity111 , says , " a couple of dozen organizations ( might be involved ) with any legislation			2
" @entity112 , who says his group " defends religious freedom for all faiths " and has " probably consulted on 12 to 15 different types of legislation in states over the past couple years , " says the push for such bills stems from a belief that , since 1990 , the @entity21 " @entity123 does not protect religious freedom as a matter of constitutional law			1
" ( his group was more deeply involved in pending legislation in places like @entity130 , according to @entity112			0
) " at that point , ... anybody who had any degree of foresight knew you were going to have conflicts over religious freedom , " @entity112 said of what he calls the fateful @entity123 ruling , @entity134			1
in that case , the plaintiffs were denied unemployment benefits in @entity145 after being fired from their jobs for using peyote in a ceremony associated with their @entity149			0
the @entity123 sided with the state , saying the plaintiffs still had a responsibility to follow state law if that law is not specifically targeted toward that religion			2
not everyone agrees that there 's a crisis at hand , including conservative republicans like @entity161			2
" @entity163 1062 does not address a specific and present concern related to religious liberty in @entity2 , " @entity161 said wednesday to explain her veto			1
" i have not heard of one example in @entity2 where a business owner 's religious liberty has been violated			1
" the money trail regardless of whether one thinks it 's justified , there 's no doubt that many efforts are actively under way along similar lines			2
@entity0 counted 14 legislative initiatives in various states similar to @entity2 's			1
but it typically takes more than ideas for such a national push : it takes influence and money			2
but where that influence and money are coming from is hard to decipher			0
that 's because of how money moves , and is spent , in politics -- especially on hot - button issues that , from the standpoint of many in the public , emerge out of nowhere			2
for one thing , as @entity56 notes , the federal government " has its own set of rules and each state has its own set of rules about what has to be disclosed and what can be spent			2
" under the federal rules alone , a lot of information does n't have to be released , says @entity204 from the @entity205			0
the groups known as 501c4s are officially corporations that , per the law , can spend as they wish			0
at some point , they might spell out their spending in tax forms but , by then , the issue may be over and the group -- which needs little more than a @entity216 to set up shop -- might no longer be operational			0
" with an issue like ( the ' religious freedom ' issue ) , where there is suddenly ... a large number of debates , it 's entirely possible that groups have popped up , and nobody knows anything about them , " @entity204 said			1
" ... it 's becoming more common to have these churning networks of money so that nobody can track it			2
" he and @entity56 both say this kind of spending is " happening more and more " since the @entity21 @entity123 's @entity239 ruling , which gave big businesses , unions and nonprofits more power to spend freely in federal elections			2
" there was a kind of cultural change after that , it opened this @entity250 about outside spending , " said @entity56			0
" what 's next ? so what are the chances that any of this -- whether it has to do with movements of religious freedom / anti-gay bills or the sometimes mysterious players behind them -- changes ? while some are demanding change , there appears to be no real momentum in @entity265 for significant campaign finance reform that might make it easier to determine who is behind these efforts			1
while some key figures may come out publicly in support of reform , it 's hard to tell who exactly is leading the way behind the scenes or even how widespread this push is			1
what will happen with these bills in other states , though , remains to be seen			2
it 's not a good sign when a @entity284 governor -- a conservative widely known nationally for her support for a controversial law that some felt unfairly targets @entity288 -- not only vetoes a proposal , as @entity161 did in @entity2 , but blasts the proposal so thoroughly as ill - timed and unnecessary			1
everyone acknowledge that times are changing			0
the issue of gay rights is example no. 1 : year after year , voters in state after state passed initiatives overwhelmingly to codify gay marriage bans in their states ' constitutions			1
but the views have been shifting			0
last june , for the first time , a @entity0 / @entity305 poll found a majority of @entity21 -- 55 % -- backed same - sex marriage , up 11 percentage points from 2008			0
a total of 17 states now allow such legal unions , due to actions by voters , state courts or their legislatures			1
federal courts have also helped move the needle on the issue , especially over the past year , with district judges striking down constitutional bans and the @entity123 ruling that same - sex spouses legally married in a state may receive federal benefits			0
@entity112 , the @entity326 's executive director , believes the " religious freedom " initiatives now working their way through the various states can succeed even if the @entity2 one did not			1
" ten years ago , the bill would have been innocuous and no one would have thought twice about it , " he said , blaming a high " level of misinformation " for sinking the @entity2 bill			1
" the whole dialogue about it was unproductive			0
" in light of what happened , @entity112 said there has to be better " public education " to avoid a repeat of what he called " this hysterically uninformed approach " by making sure " the intent of what the legislation says is clear			0
" he added that there also has to be a deeper , broader discussion within the " faith community " about their top priorities as well as a need for all " to bend over backwards and take stock of the minority ( faiths ' ) interests			0
" however this process unfolds , @entity112 said the fight is n't over			0
" the faith community , in general , needs to take stock in the state of religious freedom , " he said , " ... so that the public gets a better idea of what religious freedom is ( and that it ) needs to be addressed			1
" @entity0 's @entity374 contributed to this report .			0

@entity2 's governor vetoes a " religious freedom " bill that critics *ripped* as anti-gay
it 's one of several such initiatives that have been *floated* in at least 14 states
@entity388 , state disclosure laws make it difficult to determine who 's behind this push
