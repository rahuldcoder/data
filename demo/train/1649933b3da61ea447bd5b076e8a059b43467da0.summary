@entity0 -- a filing on behalf of basketball superstar @entity3 dismisses as " rank speculation " claims by a @entity0 lawyer that he is the athlete 's biological father , saying the man has " delusions " about alleged family ties			1
lawyers for @entity3 and his mother filed papers in federal court monday seeking to dismiss a pending lawsuit			1
@entity16 alleges the @entity17 all - star and his family have been involved in a cover - up to deny paternity , by committing fraud and misrepresentation			2
the 14 - page document said @entity25 had completely failed to prove any of the facts alleged in his june 23 complaint			0
and they said he was motivated only by fame and money , calling @entity25 's actions a " fanciful hope for celebrity			0
" the lawsuit claims @entity25 met @entity3 ' mother , @entity36 , in a @entity0 bar and restaurant in 1984 , when she was visiting from @entity39			1
she was 15 or 16 at the time , and @entity25 says they had sex only once , and was informed by @entity42 months later that she was pregnant			0
he claims she told him the child would be named @entity3 , similar to @entity44 , @entity25 's first and middle names			1
@entity25 is asking for unspecified millions of dollars in damages , and says he has been trying for three years to establish paternity , which he hopes would lead to financial and commercial opportunities			1
he is a solo legal practitioner in the @entity0 , and filed the lawsuit on his own behalf			2
he alleges a dna test that showed he was not @entity3 ' father was falsified			1
@entity3 ' attorneys , @entity53 and @entity54 , dismissed those suggestions in often mocking tones aimed at the plaintiff			2
" @entity25 's claims for millions of dollars from his putative son and @entity42 are based upon rank speculation , " said the court filing , " that a man who claims that as a 29 - year - old lawyer he got a 15 - year - old girl pregnant during a one - night stand and who never contributed a penny in child support would earn millions in commercial endorsements by crawling out of the woodwork after the child he never gave a thought to became an @entity17 star			1
" @entity3 , a native of @entity74 , @entity39 , recently left the @entity75 to sign with the @entity76 for what is believed to be one of the richest sports contracts in history			0
he is the reigning most valuable player of the @entity17 , and has carefully cultivated a public image as one of the most popular and talented athletes			0
the complaint filed june 23 by @entity25 said , " i recently have concluded that a comprehensive , sophisticated and well - funded effort might well have been under way for quite some time , perhaps beginning in its present form as early as when defendant @entity3 was in high school , to frustrate identification of his real father , and that there is a likelihood that the father in question is me			1
" @entity3 ' lawyers think otherwise			2
" @entity25 may truly believe that he is the father of @entity3 , even though a dna test has told him otherwise			2
but his delusions do not give rise to a cause of action against either @entity36 or @entity3			0
" public records show @entity25 is a former government attorney with the @entity102			0
he filed a lawsuit in 2002 against the agency , alleging racial discrimination			0
