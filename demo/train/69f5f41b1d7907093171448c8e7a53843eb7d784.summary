@entity38 , though , said the excerpts she 's read from his recovered letters gave her new appreciation for his courage , as well as sadness that he had to deal with such terror			2
" i was in tears ( reading the letters ) thinking of how he must have felt , how afraid he must have been yet determined to do his duty , as he stood there with bullets flying around him , " she said			0
" i knew he was in danger , but i never knew he was in that kind of danger			0
i just wept for him , and i wish i could have been there to help him			0
