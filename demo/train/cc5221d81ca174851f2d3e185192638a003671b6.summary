-- " he 's so good , " @entity0 said			1
we were sitting in a corner booth at a rural cafeteria in @entity6 , @entity7			2
@entity8 was talking about his older brother , @entity9			1
having spent time with the @entity0 on the rock - and - roll road over the years , i had long noticed something : whenever they were performing , @entity8 fastened his eyes right on @entity9 's			1
as they were creating their heartbreaking harmonies , he seldom looked away			2
i did n't want to ask him about that in front of his brother , but , with just the two of us there , i did			2
" i have to pay attention every second with my harmonies , " @entity8 said			1
" it 's like playing tennis with someone who is really great			2
you ca n't let your mind wander for even a microsecond , or you 'll be left behind			2
" when @entity8 died this month at the age of 74 , i recalled that conversation			1
i first met him and @entity9 during my years on tour with @entity37 ; there were occasions when we found ourselves as part of shows at the same venues , sharing the same backstage areas , dining at the same pre-concert buffets			2
there are a lot of unlikely things that i managed to become used to during those years , but one thing i could never get over -- one thing that never ceased to feel like a dream -- was knowing the @entity0			1
their talent , the beauty of their voices , was something not entirely of this @entity57			2
i was still of elementary school age when , early one morning , the clock radio snapped to life and before i could open my eyes a new song sounded in the darkness : " @entity68 , " two voices blending in a way i 'd never heard before , and it was electric , it was that kind of unanticipated jolt			2
the disc jockey said the singers were called the @entity0 , and the thought that i would ever meet them , get to know them , travel with them , would not have seemed possible			1
but such things , if you 're very lucky , can happen			2
in the days after @entity8 's death , the tributes to him from fellow musicians made me understand anew that , as famous and accomplished as those singers are , they , too , were in awe of him			1
@entity85 said that he and @entity86 used to pretend they were the @entity0 : " when @entity86 and i first started to write songs , i was @entity8 and he was @entity9			1
years later when i finally met @entity8 , i was completely starstruck and at the same time extremely impressed by his humility and gentleness of soul			1
" @entity93 : " @entity8 and @entity9 were the most beautiful sounding duo i ever heard			1
" @entity94 : " i honestly believe i 've spent the last 40 years , on every record i 've been part of for somebody else , trying to be an @entity97			1
... i 've spent my whole life chasing that beautiful , beautiful blend			2
" in the five years starting in 1957 they had 25 top - 40 hits -- " @entity68 , " " @entity103 , " " @entity105 , " " @entity106 , " " ( @entity107 ) i kissed you , " " @entity104 , " so many others -- but the numbers are the least of it			1
the sound of their voices was so pure , so achingly gorgeous , that to listen was to be humbled and filled with wonder			2
it 's not surprising at all that , across the @entity120 , of course the young - and - unknown @entity85 and the young - and - unknown @entity86 would listen to the @entity122 on imported - from - the - @entity124 records and try to be just like them			1
when i heard that @entity8 had died , i sat and did my best to recall moments in his presence , not wanting to forget a single second of them			1
he was soft - spoken and seemingly quite shy ; there was an underlay of pain that somehow felt omnipresent , and that he did n't feel compelled to dwell upon			0
music fans remember the death of @entity135 in 1959 , but few recall the funeral			0
@entity8 did : he , not yet old enough to vote , was one of @entity135 's pallbearers			1
whatever may have hurt and disheartened @entity139 , he did n't bother other people with , but you could find it in his music			0
the first words to a song he wrote later in 1959 , and that he and @entity9 recorded : " i 've been made blue / i 've been lied to / when will i be loved ? " the fact that he and @entity9 went through long periods of estrangements and silence is not a secret , but the silences ended each time a show began			0
the breathtaking sound of those voices intertwining was enough to bring listeners to tears			0
on @entity159 in 1999 they made a trip together to the woods and hills of the part of @entity7 coal country where their father had gone to work in the mines at the age of 12			0
i was writing a column for @entity171 at the time ; the @entity122 invited me to come along			0
@entity9 and @entity8 drove separate cars			1
i rode with @entity9 up @entity174 in @entity6			0
he said : " the town where i was born does n't exist anymore			0
it was called @entity177 -- just a few miles from here			0
it was a coal mining camp			0
when the coal was all gone , they tore the town down			0
" later that day i sat in that bare - bones cafeteria with @entity8 , and he told me : " there 's an acceptance of us here			1
they know who we are			0
" the brothers , on the strength of their hits , found a life for themselves far from the old coal mines			2
but if they never quite fit in with the gleaming and glitzy rock idols who were their fan - magazine - cover contemporaries , it 's probably because , as boys , they had so little in common with the others			0
" i had this haunted feeling all my life , " @entity9 said to me one day in @entity7			0
" of being odd man out			0
" i told @entity9 what @entity8 had said : how @entity8 had explained his reason for staring into @entity9 's eyes as they sang , how @entity8 had said how much he admired his brother 's gift			1
@entity9 told me : " it 's like a third person			0
when @entity8 and i sing , there are times that what comes out is not either of us , but the voice of a third person			1
" on that trip we had been joined by the great life photographer @entity220			0
late one afternoon , by the shore of @entity223 , with forest all around , the four of us watched the sun getting ready to set			0
there had been a drought -- little rain for summer months on end			0
the brothers stood there in the quiet and then @entity8 turned to @entity9 , gestured toward the treeline , and said : " it 's browner this year			1
" @entity9 , looking toward the water 's surface , said : " the lake 's down			0
" the shorthand of home			0
whatever friction may have divided them from time to time , they never took it out on their audiences			0
when i asked @entity8 about it -- the constant effort to excel -- he said : " we 've never tried to fluff it			1
we 've always tried to make it better			0
one of my favorite songs of theirs was never a major hit : " @entity258			0
" yet with @entity8 's passing the thought occurs that , because of the music he and @entity9 gave us , he , and they , never will be gone			1
and that long - ago question of @entity8 's -- " when will i be loved ? " -- has an easy answer : forever			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity266 .			2

@entity266 : the @entity0 had a talent that was *extraordinary*
in five years , they had 25 hits in the top 40 charts , he writes
despite frictions between @entity8 and @entity97 , they were *masters* at working together , @entity266 says
@entity266 : @entity85 and @entity86 used to pretend that they were the @entity0
