they were words heard around the world as investigators searched for the missing @entity4 plane			1
weeks ago , @entity6 authorities said the last message from the airplane cockpit was , " all right , good night			1
" the sign - off to air traffic controllers , which investigators said was spoken by the plane 's copilot , was among the few concrete details officials released in a mystery that 's baffled investigators and drawn global attention since the @entity18 disappeared with 239 people aboard mid-flight on march 8			1
there 's only one problem			1
it turns out , it was n't true			0
on monday , @entity6 's @entity25 said the final voice transmission from the cockpit of flight 370 was actually " good night @entity6 three seven zero			1
" @entity6 authorities gave no explanation for the discrepancy between the two quotes			1
and authorities are still trying to determine whether it was the plane 's pilot or copilot who said them			1
the new language is routine and is not a sign that anything untoward occurred aboard the flight , said @entity42 aviation analyst @entity41			2
but the change in wording weeks into the search for the missing plane raises questions about how @entity6 officials have handled the investigation			1
" it speaks to credibility issues , unfortunately , " @entity41 said			0
" we have n't had a straight , clear word that we can have a lot of fidelity in , " said @entity52 , former chief of staff at the @entity53			0
" we have the tragedy of the crash , we have the tragedy of an investigation gone awry and then we have questions about where we go from here			0
" no matter what the pilots ' last words were , it 's hard to understand what they mean without more details from authorities about what they said and how they said it , @entity42 aviation analyst @entity64 told " the lead with @entity77 " on monday			2
" without the preceding information ... either the transcript or the recordings themselves , it 's difficult to know what any of that really means , " he said			2
" and that 's the problem with this investigation , which has been so opaque			2
" @entity6 authorities have defended their handling of the situation			1
acting transportation minister @entity90 said monday that authorities were not hiding anything by declining to release some details of the missing flight			2
some details are part of ongoing investigations into what happened to the plane , he said			2
" we are not hiding anything , " he said			0
" we are just following the procedure that is being set			0
" source : plane 's turn considered ' criminal act ' a @entity6 government source told @entity42 monday that the airliner 's turn off course is being considered a " criminal act , " either by one of the pilots or someone else onboard the missing airliner			1
and in a background briefing given to @entity42 , @entity6 investigators said they believed the plane was " flown by someone with good flying knowledge of the aircraft			1
" several friends of capt. @entity122 said they refuse to believe he could have been the " criminal " controlling the plane			1
rallying to his defense , they showed @entity42 's @entity126 pictures of him at flight school			1
" i think finally it will come to a stage where people think of him as a hero when things come out , " friend @entity129 said			0
" i think he is a hero			0
" a senior @entity6 government official last week told @entity42 law enforcement analyst @entity138 that authorities have found nothing in days of investigating the two pilots that leads them to any motive , be it political , suicidal or extremist			1
and an ongoing @entity148 review of the two pilots ' hard drives , including one in a flight simulator @entity152 had built at his home , has not turned up a " smoking gun , " a @entity156 official with knowledge of the investigation told @entity42 last week			2
in a @entity162 post , the captain 's daughter lashed out at a @entity164 tabloid that claimed to quote her criticizing her father			2
" you should consider making movies since you are so good at making up stories and scripts out of thin air , " @entity166 wrote			2
" may @entity172 have mercy on your souls			0
" several leads dry up as search ramps up potential leads on the missing @entity178 keep coming			2
so do the setbacks and frustrations			0
ten military planes , a civilian jet and nine ships are part of tuesday 's @entity187 search , which spans a swath west of @entity189 that 's 120,000 square kilometers ( 46,300 square miles ) , the @entity181 said			1
monday 's search ended without finding anything significant , @entity191 officials said			1
four orange objects spotted by search aircraft and earlier described as promising turned out be nothing more than old fishing gear , they said			2
finding possible leads that turn out to be trash , fishing gear or jellyfish is n't easy for search teams , @entity202			1
@entity203 told @entity42 's " @entity204			2
" " you have that excitement , and then when it is garbage or seaweed or something like that , it 's hard , it 's hard to realize you did n't find anything , " he said			2
" but you just keep at it and you keep at it			0
and this is what we do			0
this is what we train for			0
" @entity221 officials loaded underwater locating gear aboard an @entity191 naval ship and set out to sea monday evening , but wo n't be able to use the equipment until investigators narrow the search zone			1
the gear includes a pinger locator that 's towed behind a ship and scans for the sound of the locator beacon attached to the plane 's flight data recorder			1
also onboard is an underwater drone that can scan the ocean floor for debris			0
it will take the ship , the @entity240 , three days just to get to the search zone , leaving precious little time to locate the plane 's flight data recorders before the batteries on its locator beacon run out			1
the batteries are designed to last 30 days ; the plane has been missing for 24 days			2
under favorable sea conditions , the pingers can be heard 2 nautical miles away			0
but high seas , background noise , wreckage or silt can all make pingers harder to detect			0
in this case , searchers barely know where to look at all			0
" we are searching a vast area of ocean , and we are working on quite limited information , " @entity191 prime minister @entity259 told reporters monday			0
" nevertheless , the best brains in the world are applying themselves to this task			0
... if this mystery is solvable , we will solve it			0
" late last week , the search area shifted more than 600 miles after what authorities described as " a new credible lead			2
" but a @entity276 report monday night , citing anonymous people familiar with the matter , said before that crews had searched for three days in the wrong location due to " lapses in coordination among countries and companies " trying to find the missing jet			1
what happened ? @entity285 , one of the reporters who wrote the story , said it boiled down to poor coordination between two parts of the investigation : one dealing with satellite data , and the other one dealing with fuel consumption and aircraft performance			1
" and so what we 're left with is sort of a three - day gap where it 's clear that folks were definitely looking in the wrong place , " he said			1
despite false leads and other setbacks that have plagued the search , officials have vowed to keep looking			1
" the effort is ramping up , not winding down , " @entity259 told @entity42 on monday			0
@entity6 will ask the @entity156 about the possibility of deploying more military assets , @entity90 said monday			1
@entity156 secretary of defense @entity310 said monday that he will consider any additional requests from @entity90			0
" i do n't know what additional requests he will make of me , " he said			0
" i certainly will listen carefully to whatever those are			0
... we 're providing everything that we can provide , as are other countries			0
" get up to speed relatives ' demands family members of people onboard flight 370 have accused @entity6 officials of giving them confusing , conflicting information since the plane vanished more than three weeks ago			1
on monday , dozens of @entity331 family members visited a @entity333 temple			0
they chanted , lit candles and meditated			0
" @entity331 are kindhearted people , " said @entity336 , the families ' designated representative			0
" but we can clearly distinguish between the good and evil			2
we will never forgive for covering the truth from us and the criminal who delayed the rescue mission			2
" @entity336 asked @entity6 to apologize for announcing march 24 that the plane had crashed , despite the lack of any " direct evidence			1
" at the daily press briefing , @entity90 responded , saying @entity6 prime minister @entity350 had not used the word " crash " or mentioned a lack of survivors in his announcement that the plane 's flight had " ended " in the southern @entity187			1
he described a meeting saturday between @entity6 authorities and @entity178 relatives as " the most difficult meeting i 've ever attended			1
" " the families are heartbroken			0
for many , the strain of the past few weeks has been unbearable , " he said			0
he said @entity6 will hold a high - level briefing for families where experts will explain some of the data and methodology used to guide the search			1
he also said authorities have discussed with the families what happens if they are unable to find debris from the missing plane			0
but he declined to discuss it with reporters monday , saying " to be fair to the families , that is something i would not want to share with the public at the moment			0
" @entity382 has also publicly slammed @entity6 's efforts to find the @entity18			1
of the 239 people aboard the jetliner , 154 were @entity331			0
but @entity6 says it 's done its best with what it has			1
" history will judge us as a country that has been very responsible , " @entity90 said			0
flight attendant 's husband has no answers for children			1
