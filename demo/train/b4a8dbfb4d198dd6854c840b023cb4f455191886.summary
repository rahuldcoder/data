tests on the long - lost skeleton of @entity2 reveal the medieval monarch had a taste for rich foods such as peacock , heron and swan , and that his liking for the finer things in life -- including wine -- increased significantly after he became the king of @entity14			1
scientists at the @entity16 measured the levels of isotopes including oxygen , strontium , nitrogen and carbon in the remains of @entity2 , found buried beneath a parking lot in the @entity14 city of @entity26 in 2012			1
in a paper published in the @entity28 , they say the tests can reveal clues as to where a person lived , and what they ate and drank , allowing experts " to reconstruct the life history " of the last @entity35 king			1
read more : @entity2 's grave opens to the public isotope geochemist @entity40 , who led the study , said two teeth -- a molar and premolar -- and two bones -- a rib and femur -- were analyzed because each held different information and could offer a variety of clues to @entity2 's life			1
" the teeth develop in childhood and do n't change , so from them we can get information about a person 's early years , " she told @entity53			0
" bones are different ; they remodel and repair themselves through life -- if you break a bone , for example , it can heal			2
the femur is dense and slow - growing , so it can tell us about the last 10 to 15 years of a person 's life , whereas the rib bone is much more spongy and regenerates much more quickly , so it can reveal information about the last two to three years			1
" high - protein diet this is key in the case of @entity2 , since he became king just 26 months before his death at the @entity75 in 1485 -- and analysis suggests his diet changed markedly in the few short years after he was crowned			1
medieval aristocrats are known to have eaten high - protein diets full of freshwater fish and wildfowl , in part because of religious observances that called for " meat - free " fasting for up to a third of the year			1
fish and wildfowl -- birds such as heron , swan and egret -- were not considered meat			0
" obviously , @entity2 was a nobleman beforehand , and so his diet would be reasonably rich already , " explained @entity40			2
" but once he became king we would expect him to be wining and dining more , banqueting more			0
food was a real mark of status in the medieval period			0
" we have the menu from his coronation banquet and it was very elaborate -- lots of wildfowl , including real ' delicacies ' such as peacock and swan , and fish -- carp , pike and so on , which were cultivated in special fishponds			0
" scientific analysis matching up historic records from the king 's lifetime with brand new scientific data harvested from his remains has offered experts a unique opportunity to " cross-check " what is already known about his life and times			1
as @entity128 , the @entity129 archaeologist in charge of the dig which uncovered the king 's remains , explained : " it is very rare indeed in archaeology to be able to identify a named individual with precise dates and a documented life			2
" this has enabled stable - isotope analysis to show how his environment changed at different times and , perhaps most significantly , identified marked changes in his diet when he became king in 1483			2
" isotope analysis backs up many of the records of @entity2 's life -- that he was born in eastern @entity14 but spent part of his childhood in western @entity146			1
and knowing where he lived , from ancient documents , allowed the experts to learn something new about isotope analysis			0
" by looking at the levels of oxygen isotopes , we can tell where a person lived , because the oxygen comes from the drinking water that they consumed , " said @entity40			0
" in this case , the isotopes suggested that [ towards the end of his life ] @entity2 was living in the extreme southwest of @entity146 , but we know from the records that this is n't the case , so we had to look for another explanation			2
" wine habit given the discoveries they had already made about @entity2 's extravagant diet , they began to wonder if the discrepancy in oxygen isotopes pointed to the fact he was drinking something other than water			2
brewing water into ale is known to alter isotope levels , but beer was not a high - status drink in the medieval era			1
" we needed something that would tie in with the luxury food he would have been eating , " said @entity40			0
" back then wine was very much the preserve of the upper classes -- it was imported , expensive and only the very wealthy could afford it			0
" by carrying out tests with modern equivalents , the scientists were able to conclude that @entity2 drank up to a bottle of wine a day -- and to work out , for the first time , that wine consumption affects oxygen isotope levels			1
" it is fascinating , " said @entity40			0
" we use these techniques all the time , but we are never able to ' cross-check ' them , and it is only his which enabled us to figure it out			0

tests on skeleton of @entity2 , a king of @entity14 , reveal a liking for the finer things in life
the remains of the monarch , who ruled for 2 years before he was *killed* , were found in 2012
medieval aristocrats are known to have eaten high - protein diets
tests also revealed that @entity2 had a taste for wine -- perhaps a bottle a day
