-- i am a woman with chronic schizophrenia			1
i have spent hundreds of days in psychiatric hospitals			1
i could have ended up living most of my life on a back ward , but things turned out quite differently			1
in fact , i 've managed to stay free of hospitals for almost 30 years			1
this is perhaps my proudest accomplishment			1
that does n't mean that i have been free of all psychiatric struggles			1
for example , on my analyst 's announcing his planned retirement , i fell apart			1
my best friend , @entity16 , sensed that something was terribly wrong , and he came to @entity18 , @entity19 , to see me			1
quoting from some writings of mine : " i opened the door of my studio apartment			2
@entity16 would later tell me that for all the times he had seen me psychotic , what he saw that afternoon shocked him			2
for a week or more i had barely eaten			2
i was gaunt , and moved as though my legs were wooden			2
my face looked ( and felt ) like a mask			2
i 'd pulled down all the shades , so the apartment was in near total darkness , the air fetid , the place a shambles			2
@entity16 , a lawyer and psychologist , has worked with many patients who suffer from severe mental illness			1
to this day he 'll tell me that on that afternoon i looked as bad as any he 'd ever seen			2
" ' hi , ' i said , then returned to the couch , where i was silent for several minutes			2
' thank you for coming , @entity16 , ' i finally said			2
tell the clocks to stop			2
time is time has come			2
' ... ' i 'm being pushed into a grave , the situation is grave , ' i moaned			2
' gravity is pulling me down			0
tell them to get away			0
' " watch @entity50 ' @entity49 * * * as a young woman , i was in psychiatric hospitals for three lengthy stays			1
despite my diagnosis with schizophrenia and my " grave prognosis " -- that i would live in a board and care facility and work at a menial job at best -- i am a chaired professor of law at the @entity62 in @entity63 , with a beloved husband , @entity65 , and many good friends			1
i 'd like to tell you how that happened and describe my experience of being psychotic			0
i qualify that by saying my experience , because everyone becomes psychotic in his or her own way			0
one friday night on the roof of the @entity77 library i scared my classmates with a full - blown psychotic episode			0
quoting from my writings : " the next morning , i went to my professor 's office to ask for an extension , and began gibbering unintelligibly as i had the night before			1
he eventually brought me to the @entity85			0
" someone i 'll call just ' @entity87 , ' and his whole team of goons swooped down , grabbed me , lifted me out of the chair and slammed me down on a nearby bed with such force that i saw stars			0
then they bound both my legs and arms to the metal bed , with thick leather straps			0
" a sound came out of my mouth that i 'd never heard before			0
half - groan , half - scream , barely human , and pure terror			0
then the sound came again , forced from somewhere deep inside my belly and scraping my throat raw			0
" @entity49 : @entity106 on how electroshock therapy changed him this incident resulted in my involuntary hospitalization			0
one reason the doctors gave for holding me against my will was that i was gravely disabled			1
supporting this view , they wrote in my chart that i was not able to do my @entity77 homework			0
i wonder what that meant for most of the rest of @entity18			0
during the next year , i would spend five months in psychiatric hospitals on the @entity121			0
at times , i spent up to 20 hours a day in restraints -- hands tied , hands and feet tied down , hands and feet tied down with a net tied tightly across my chest			0
i never struck anyone , i never harmed anyone , i never made any direct threats to anyone			0
i was lucky i was n't one of the one to three people who die in restraints each week			1
today , i am pro-psychiatry and anti-force			0
i do n't think force is effective as a treatment			0
and i think using force is a terrible thing to do to another human being with a terrible illness			1
* * * everything about my illness says that i should n't be here			1
and i am , i think , for three reasons			0
first , i 've had excellent treatment , both psychoanalytic psychotherapy and medication			0
second , i have many family members and close friends who know me and who know my illness			1
third , @entity150 is an enormously supportive workplace which has been able not just to accommodate my needs , but to embrace my needs			0
even with all of that -- excellent treatment , wonderful friends and family , enormously supportive work environment -- i did not make my illness public until relatively late in my life			1
and that 's because the stigma against mental illness is so powerful that i did n't feel safe with people knowing			1
if you hear nothing else today , please hear that there are not schizophrenics , there are people with schizophrenia			1
and each of these people may be a parent , may be your sibling , may be your neighbor , may be your colleague			1
@entity49 : @entity177 's stroke of insight * * * i often get asked the " magic pill " question : would i take a pill that would instantly cure me ? the answer is a fast and emphatic " yes			0
" that said , i do n't wish to be seen as regretting the life i could have had if i 'd not been ill. nor am i asking anyone for their pity			0
what i rather wish to say is that the humanity we all share is more important than the mental illness we may not			1
what those of us who suffer with mental illness want is what everyone wants : in the words of @entity200 , to work and to love			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity50 .			1

@entity50 ' career as a law student was halted by schizophrenia
she was *institutionalized* and doctors said she would at best hold a menial job
@entity212 became a law professor , " genius grant " winner and *author*
she says she continues to cope with illness and urges people to *overcome* stigma
