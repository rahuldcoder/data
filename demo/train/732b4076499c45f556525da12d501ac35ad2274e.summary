-- @entity2 's humanitarian generosity in the 1990s appears to have had some unintended , and unwelcome , consequences , as dozens of young ethnic @entity5 living there have embraced jihad , returning to the @entity7 to join the @entity9 affiliate @entity8			1
@entity11 's @entity10 is still investigating whether one of the attackers at the @entity14 in @entity15 had lived in @entity11			1
the 23 - year old had come to @entity11 with his family at the age of nine as a refugee , but according to @entity11 media had become unsettled after being unable to find work and begun to frequent jihadist websites			2
in a statement last week , the @entity10 said it had not yet been determined whether the man took part in the attack , but added : " based on the information that we have uncovered this far in the investigation ... the suspicion of his involvement has been strengthened			0
" if it is confirmed , the @entity11 citizen will become the latest in a lengthening line of @entity5 from @entity2 who have either joined @entity8 or planned terror attacks in their adopted homelands			1
he would also , like his compatriot @entity39 -- an @entity41 extremist who killed dozens at a youth camp at @entity45 near @entity46 in 2011 -- have demonstrated just how deadly gun assaults on civilians can be			0
the @entity8 commander known as @entity50 who was targeted by @entity51 in an unsuccessful raid in @entity53 earlier this month also spent several years in @entity11			1
@entity55 counter-terrorism sources told @entity0 they suspected @entity50 had a hand in the @entity14 attack and was connected to the suspected @entity11 gunman			2
@entity55 mall attack video fuels army looting claims @entity61 , a @entity62 and former intelligence informant who penetrated @entity8 and spent time with @entity64 , told @entity0 that @entity62 intelligence are particularly concerned about the threat of a @entity53 terrorist operative who works closely with @entity68 called @entity69			1
storm says @entity62 intelligence told him of their concern that al @entity53 was planning terrorist attacks inside @entity62 after intercepting communications between him and militants there			1
@entity77 -- who also goes by the name @entity79 -- came to @entity62 as a young refugee , was granted permanent resident status , and settled in @entity82			0
in 2005 , al @entity53 travelled to @entity53 where he joined other foreign fighters affiliated with the @entity85 , an @entity86 militia that evolved into @entity8			2
a year later al @entity53 travelled to @entity87 to broker a weapons deal with @entity9 , according to @entity70			2
after serving about two years in jail al @entity53 returned to @entity53 , where he joined @entity8			2
according to @entity70 , who exchanged messages with @entity69 , he also worked closely with @entity94 , an @entity96 operative wanted by the @entity97 , and @entity98 , a @entity53 @entity8 operative who was arrested navigating the sea between @entity87 and @entity53 by the @entity101 in 2011			2
@entity50 's name also featured in the trial of two @entity104 @entity5 who were arrested in 2010 after allegedly training with @entity8 in @entity53			1
@entity104 authorities accused them of planning to return to @entity53 to carry out terrorist attacks			1
a phone intercept between a senior @entity8 figure in @entity53 and one of those arrested was introduced during the trial			2
" you should contact this brother -- his name is @entity50 , " the senior figure said on the phone			0
after being convicted the pair were subsequently acquitted by an appeals court , but it nevertheless noted the men were in contact with , and sympathetic to , @entity8			0
analysts estimate there are several hundred committed @entity8 supporters across @entity2			2
there are about 25,000 ethnic @entity5 in @entity11 , 17,000 in @entity62 and 44,000 in @entity127			1
the great majority arrived after @entity53 collapsed as a state in 1991			2
most have been grateful for sanctuary but a very small minority have become radicalized , especially among those who came to @entity133 as children			0
in one of the most bizarre cases , two teenage sisters of @entity53 origin left their home in @entity11 last week -- apparently headed to @entity140			1
according to a @entity11 police statement : " the family that reported the missing girls is deeply concerned by the purpose of the journey and fears they might have gone to @entity140			1
" the @entity11 newspaper @entity150 reported that the sisters , aged 16 and 19 , left a message saying for their family saying @entity154 in @entity140 were being " attacked from all directions			1
" among ethnic @entity5 who have tried to carry out acts of terrorism in @entity2 is @entity158 , who first moved to @entity62 in 1995 at the age of 12			1
three years ago , he tried to murder @entity160 , the @entity62 cartoonist responsible in 2005 for a controversial depiction of the @entity162			1
police arrived minutes after @entity158 forced his way into @entity160 's house in @entity166 with an ax			0
@entity158 had already been under observation by @entity62 security services because of his suspected close links to @entity8			0
he is now serving a nine - year sentence for attempted murder			0
of all @entity9 's affiliates none has made more noise about the cartoons than @entity8			0
some analysts believe that is because @entity5 brought their anger over the issue with them when they travelled to @entity53 to join @entity8			1
the group has explicitly threatened another @entity2 cartoonist , @entity181			1
in a 2011 video subtitled in @entity183 and @entity104 , @entity127 -- a @entity104 - @entity53 member of the group -- said : " we will catch you wherever you are			0
" and he added : in whatever hole you are hiding -- know what awaits you -- as it will be nothing but this : slaughter , " as he simulated slitting his throat			0
@entity196 , one of @entity62 's leading experts on @entity8 , told @entity0 in 2011 : " intelligence services have very little understanding of what 's going on			0
recruiting informants has been an uphill battle because @entity5 do n't trust them to protect them			0
" " those attracted are usually quite young -- there 's the usual issue of a clash of cultures -- of being stuck between east @entity207 and @entity2 and not knowing where they belong , " @entity196 told @entity0			2
@entity8 has recruiters in several @entity212 countries who try to persuade young @entity5 to join the group in @entity53 , and help them get there , according to @entity212 counter-terrorism officials			1
there is also evidence that jihadists of @entity221 backgrounds in @entity2 have gravitated toward @entity8			0
one reason is the increased mixing of @entity53 nationals with extremists of @entity228 and south @entity227 descent in hardline @entity230 mosques across @entity2			1
@entity231 , who is @entity232 - born but lived in @entity127 , was one of four men convicted of a plotting a @entity235 - style attack against the offices of a @entity62 newspaper , @entity237 , in 2010			0
the newspaper had printed cartoons of the @entity162 several years previously			0
@entity231 was suspected of having joined up with jihadist militants in @entity53 in 2006 before fleeing the country , according to a @entity62 security source			0
he was sentenced to 12 years in prison			0
the numbers of militants traveling from @entity133 to @entity53 is believed to have slowed in the last two years because of setbacks suffered by @entity8 in @entity53 , its internal power struggle , stories of mistreatment of @entity212 recruits , and the magnetic pull of jihad in @entity140			1
but @entity2 's intelligence services remain concerned about a terror pipeline to , and from , east @entity207 .			0
