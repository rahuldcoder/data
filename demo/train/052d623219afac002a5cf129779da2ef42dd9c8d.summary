-- the @entity4 administration calculates it 's likely @entity6 may test fire mobile ballistic missiles at any time , based on the most recent intelligence showing @entity9 probably has completed launch preparations , a @entity2 official said tuesday			1
the administration believes a test launch could happen without @entity6 issuing a standard notice to commercial aviation and maritime shipping warning them to stay away from the missile 's path , according to the official , who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the information			1
he cautioned most of the information comes from satellite imagery , so it 's impossible to reach a definitive conclusion because the @entity2 has no means to gather information on the ground			1
" we hope they issue a notification , but at this point we do n't expect it			0
we are working on the assumption they wo n't , " the official said			0
he said the launch could be " imminent , " but also cautioned that the @entity2 " simply does n't know			1
" the official , along with a @entity39 official , said that the @entity2 has been able to keep satellites over the suspected launch area for most of the past week			1
the @entity2 thinks the missiles remain at a point about halfway down the eastern coast of @entity6 and are about 10 miles inland			1
imagery has been impeded by some bad weather , which means there is less than perfect knowledge about what is happening on the ground			0
but based on what the @entity2 has seen , the belief is that the missiles have received their liquid fuel and are ready for launch			1
after any launch , @entity2 satellites and radars in the region would be able to calculate the trajectory of missiles within minutes and quickly conclude whether they are on a test path headed for open ocean or potentially headed for land areas such as @entity67			1
the @entity2 and @entity67 would then have to decide whether to try to shoot the missiles down , the officials said			1
' @entity71 and direct ' threat to @entity2 security also tuesday , the top @entity2 commander in the @entity74 called repeated @entity6 violations of @entity77 resolutions forbidding the " building and testing " of long - range ballistic missiles and nuclear weapons " a clear and direct threat to @entity2 national security and regional peace and stability			1
" " a major conflict in @entity6 could have unpredictable , long term and far reaching impacts due to the central location of the @entity92 in @entity93 and the vital importance of @entity96 trade to the global economy , " said adm. @entity86 , commander of the @entity87			1
the admiral spoke at a @entity100 hearing and submitted testimony to the committee			0
he said he 's confident that the @entity2 would be able to help defend @entity2 forces and its friends			1
he acknowledged the importance of @entity107 's role in reducing tensions on the @entity92			0
the hearing came as @entity6 issued its latest dispatch of ominous rhetoric tuesday , telling foreigners in @entity113 they should take steps to protect themselves in the event of a conflict			1
" @entity119 's stated emphasis on economic development and promises of economic growth have so far yielded little , and are undermined by @entity6 missile launches and nuclear tests that lead to further sanctions and international isolation , " @entity86 said , referring to @entity6 's leader			1
" @entity6 's nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs , its illicit sales of conventional arms , and its ongoing proliferation activities remain a threat to regional stability and underscore the requirement for effective missile defense , " he said			1
the admiral was asked whether there 's ever been a time of greater tension among @entity6 , @entity113 and the @entity2 since the end of the @entity142 in the 1950s			1
" i would agree in my recollection , i do n't know a greater time , " he said			0
the question of @entity107 asked about @entity107 and its longtime close relationship with @entity6 , he said the country could play a key role in persuading the @entity6 government to engage in " restraint , " but " they could do more			1
" senators expressed concerns , skepticism and outright criticism of @entity107			0
sen. @entity156 , @entity158 - @entity157 , called the country " a communist dictatorship " that fears individual freedoms			0
@entity86 regards @entity107 as neither a friend nor a foe			0
he said that sometimes , @entity107 can be " more nuanced " than the @entity2 , and he noted some reporting that the leadership in @entity107 has made some statements about the issue			1
over the weekend , @entity107 president @entity169 was quoted as saying that no nation " should be allowed to throw a region and even the whole world into chaos for selfish gain			0
" while he did n't mention @entity6 , the comments were seen as a reference to @entity9			1
" there no benefit to the @entity107 of having this type of activity occurring on their borders , no possible benefit that i can see from this			0
so they will , i believe , in time , work this problem to their national interest just like we do and the @entity113 do , " @entity86 said			0
the saber rattling is making an impact , poll says meanwhile , the storm of warlike words coming from @entity9 appears to have rattled @entity2 , with more than four in 10 saying they see the reclusive nation as an immediate threat to the @entity2 , a new @entity0 / @entity198 poll shows			1
that 's up 13 percentage points in less than a month , @entity0 polling director @entity199 said			2
" if @entity6 leader @entity119 wanted to get the attention of the @entity2 public , his strategy is starting to work , " @entity199 said			1
@entity6 's unnerving message advising foreigners to secure shelter or evacuate in case of hostilities came as @entity67 set up missile defenses in @entity213 and @entity6 workers failed to turn up for work in the industrial complex jointly operated by @entity217			2
interactive map : @entity6 's missile capabilities in the statement published by state - run media tuesday , the @entity6 's @entity220 reiterated accusations that @entity224 and @entity225 are seeking to provoke a war with @entity9			2
" once a war is ignited on the peninsula , it will be an all - out war , " the committee said , adding that @entity6 does n't want foreigners in @entity113 to " fall victim " to a conflict			2
but staff at the @entity235 in @entity225 appeared unimpressed			0
" we are not commenting on the specifics of every piece of rhetoric from @entity6 , " said @entity236 , head of media affairs at the embassy			2
" our travel advice remains unchanged			0
at this moment , we see no immediate threat to @entity246 citizens in @entity113			0
" and foreign visitors in @entity225 did n't appear to be panicking tuesday			0
@entity225 's message to tourists : do n't be afraid " i am concerned , but not enough not to make the trip , " said @entity250 , who was visiting from @entity251			0
@entity0 poll : worries about @entity6 threat at all - time high threat after threat @entity6 has unleashed a torrent of dramatic threats against the @entity2 and @entity113 in recent weeks , including that of a possible nuclear strike			1
but many analysts have cautioned that much of what @entity119 's regime is saying is bluster , noting that it is believed to still be years away from developing an operational nuclear missile			0
a more likely scenario , they say , is a localized provocative move			0
amid the fiery words from @entity9 and annual military training exercises by @entity2 and @entity113 forces in the region , government officials in @entity224 and @entity225 say they are taking the @entity6 threat seriously			1
in the days before @entity6 's latest round of threats and provocations , @entity2 and @entity6 officials met in @entity280 , although nothing came of the meeting , said a source familiar with what happened			1
the source described the meeting as part of regular back channel exchanges between the countries			0
@entity290 , the @entity2 envoy for six - party talks aimed at @entity6 denuclearization , met with @entity6 's deputy un ambassador @entity293 - ryol in mid-march , according to the source			1
@entity290 repeated the @entity4 administration 's call for @entity6 to avoid provocative actions and urged a return to diplomacy			2
@entity293 promised to carry the messages back to @entity9 , the source said			0
the @entity6 was blamed for two attacks on @entity113 in 2010 , one on a navy vessel and another on the island of @entity305			2
those attacks killed 50 people			0
@entity9 still denies responsibility for the sinking of the @entity113 warship , the @entity311 , in which 46 sailors died			0
@entity67 deploys missile defense batteries on tuesday , @entity67 said it had deployed missile defense systems around @entity213 amid expectations that the @entity316 could carry out a missile test in the coming days			0
the @entity67 government is making " every possible effort to protect the @entity67 people and ensure their safety , " said prime minister @entity322			0
@entity113 government officials have said they think @entity6 could conduct the test launch of a missile as soon as wednesday , following reports that the @entity6 had loaded as many as two medium - range missiles onto mobile launchers on its east coast			1
the @entity2 had previously said it was moving missile defense systems to @entity331 , a @entity74 territory that is home to @entity2 naval and air bases			2
@entity6 has cited those bases when listing possible targets for missile attacks			2
how does @entity6 make its money ? a symbol of cooperation at risk the souring situation on the @entity92 was in evidence in the failure of more than 50,000 @entity6 workers to show up for work tuesday morning at the @entity346 , the manufacturing zone shared by the two koreas that had operated without such an interruption for eight years			2
the @entity6 had declared monday that it would pull out its workers and temporarily suspend activities at the complex , which sits on its side of the heavily fortified border but houses the operations of more than 120 @entity113 companies			2
on tuesday , the @entity357 said the @entity6 workers had n't reported for work in the district , which is the last major symbol of cooperation between the two @entity348			2
analysts had expressed skepticism that @entity9 would follow through on previous threats to shut down the complex , noting that it is an important source of hard currency to @entity119 's regime			0
the move also is likely to put pressure on the city of @entity346 itself , where the @entity6 workers and their families live			2
with an estimated population of between 200,000 and 300,000 people , it is one of the impoverished country 's largest cities			0
