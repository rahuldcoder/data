-- the imagined inventions of victorian - era @entity3 novelist @entity2 may be coming closer to reality			1
who , you ask ? @entity2 was an illustrator and writer for popular science - fiction magazines , and is sometimes compared to @entity10			1
in his 1890 novel " @entity12 siecle			2
@entity14 vie electrique , " he described something called a " telephonoscope			2
" since then , we 've seen telephonoscopes -- basically videophones -- in everything from " the @entity22 " to " @entity23			2
" what we have n't seen is the videophone in our living rooms			2
that may finally be changing			0
the common use of videophones could happen through three technologies that separately are n't exactly considered bleeding edge today : high - speed @entity32 , a television , and @entity34			1
@entity35 says it will put the @entity37 calling service @entity34 as an application on its televisions , allowing phone calls to be made on camera right from a couch , just like @entity43 talking into her tv set			1
the @entity34 - enabled tv follows similar announcements from @entity47 and @entity48 at the @entity49 in january			1
the models will range from to $ 1,200 to $ 2,000 for @entity47 's set			0
@entity35 and @entity48 have not yet announced how much they will charge			1
the @entity34 on tv application should work similarly on all three models , which in turn should closely mimic the version of the application that many people use to make free pc to pc calls , or for a fee , pc to landline			1
skype accounts are free to set up and can be activated using the tv 's remote control right on the screen			0
the video calls will also be free , as will voice calls between @entity34 users			1
using @entity34 to call traditional landline and mobile phones is a few cents per minute			1
calls can be answered while watching a program , but it 's not yet possible to both talk and continue to watch uninterrupted			0
by the time these models actually hit stores in late spring there should be three tv makers offering @entity34 on their tvs			1
and not just any three tv makers , but the world 's largest overall ( @entity35 sells practically one of every five tvs sold ) , the leader in plasmas ( @entity47 ) , and @entity48 , which is close behind @entity35 , selling 15 percent of all tvs			1
while @entity2 wrote about the idea , @entity86 did the most to advance the idea from the pages of @entity91 sci - fi to actuality			2
unfortunately its 1960s videophone system , known as the @entity94 , was a bust			2
few ever signed up for the service because you had to reserve call times and pay a whopping $ 16 per minute			2
the idea , however , was at least on the right track : making videophones accessible to normal folk			0
today teleconferencing is a common tool for companies to put employees in different locations virtually , if not physically , in the same conference room			2
but the high cost of the fancy systems from companies like @entity112 and @entity113 does n't make them consumer - friendly			1
@entity112 also announced at @entity49 it would be offering a home version of its telepresence software sometime this year , and did not yet mention a price			0
videophones for the home have never really caught on in the way they have at businesses			0
even versions of the concept built into a corded telephone did n't really generate much excitement			0
usually this was a small screen attached to a phone base station and conversations had to take place wherever the phone was plugged in , which tended to be places like a dresser or a kitchen counter			0
video calls today can be made online			0
they 're easy and cheap , and of course do n't require the purchase of an pricey new tv			0
a computer with a built - in @entity141 and a voice - over - ip service like @entity34 or a chat application like @entity144 usually suffice , but it is still an activity that 's attached to a computer , and therefore going to be intimidating to people who either do n't like or have trouble with technology			1
tvs are far more accessible though			0
now with major companies like @entity35 , @entity47 , and @entity48 pushing the idea of the tv as videophone , the concept does at least have the chance to catch on			1
consumer surveys show that people are beginning to buy @entity32 - connected tvs , which allow not just @entity34 calls , but also other activities on the tv that are normally confined to the computer			1
that includes accessing internet radio and video streaming from services like @entity167 and @entity168 , and social sites like @entity170 , @entity171 , and @entity172			2
a survey of 800 @entity175 consumers who bought tvs in january found that 27.5 percent of them have connected their new sets to the @entity32 , either through the tv itself or via an external device such as a game console or digital video box , according to @entity184			0
and of those , almost 42 percent recently purchased a @entity186 - connected tv			2
and @entity34 likely wo n't be a brand new concept to a lot of those new tv owners			1
@entity34 already has over 521 million registered accounts , so there 's a built - in audience who is already signed up and knows how to use it			1
but the quality may not be what some people expect , says @entity198 analyst @entity197			1
" teleconferencing is inherently kind of a low - quality experience , especially in a consumer home			1
on a computer it works ok , but blown up to the size of the tv , i was n't terribly impressed with some of the demos at @entity49 , " he said			0
and quality aside , even in terms of logistics , there 's a lot to consider			2
even with an @entity32 - connected tv , you still need a decent internet connection , and for a two - way video call , you have to have people on the other end with the same set up			1
in other words , " it 's really early , " @entity197 said			0
time will tell if videophones are just a fad or about to become an integral part of the modern idea of the " connected living room			0
" the tools are there , but it 's entirely possible that people do n't want to use their tvs like that			0
either way , even if the latest incarnation of @entity2 's telephonoscope does n't gain widespread acceptance , he still has a decent track record for his prognostications			0
other things he predicted in the same 1890 novel ? the use of submarines , helicopters , and biological warfare			0

high - speed internet , television and @entity34 could *combine* to create videophone
@entity35 says it will put @entity37 calling service @entity34 as application on its televisions
" @entity260 is inherently kind of a low - quality experience , " analyst says
