-- an @entity2 man who " surfed " a floating whale carcass surrounded by sharks has admitted that he was an " idiot " to attempt the foolhardy feat. @entity7 , 26 , was on a boating excursion with friends off the coast of @entity11 over the weekend when they came across the dead whale			1
" out on the boat with the boys and one of my mates thought it 'd be pretty funny if i surfed the whale , so i just did it , " @entity7 told @entity0 affiliate @entity13			1
he launched himself into the water and clambered onto the rotting carcass			0
but his friends ' mirth quickly turned to horror when they noticed all the sharks swimming around the whale , feasting on its flesh			1
" @entity26 ! there 's sharks there ! come back ! " screams one of his friends in a video of the bizarre scene			1
' @entity35 thinks i 'm an idiot ' several tiger sharks and at least one great white shark were reported to have been feeding on the carcass			1
@entity7 said he 'd seen the sharks , including the great white , before he jumped in			1
but that did n't put him off taking the leap			0
" he was too busy chomping on the whale so was n't too bad , " he told @entity13			0
but not everyone was impressed			0
the @entity48 said his behavior was risky and irresponsible , the @entity47 reported			0
and @entity7 ' parents were none too pleased			2
" @entity35 thinks i 'm an idiot , @entity53 's not too proud either , " he said			1
he said he now agrees with their assessment and is " pretty grateful to still be alive			2
" @entity56 brings threat to beach authorities say that because the whale was dead and @entity7 did n't remove any part of it , he wo n't be fined for his actions , @entity13 reported			1
the carcass has since washed up on a beach at @entity66 , a suburb of the city of @entity68 , apparently drawing sharks with it			2
authorities said they had closed that beach and two others nearby , with sharks sighted in the vicinity			0
@entity7 , meanwhile , says he wo n't be trying any similar stunts again			2
" i 've done it , " he said			0
" do n't need to do it again			0
" could dead whales explode ?			0

" one of my mates thought it 'd be pretty funny , " he tells local *broadcaster*
but now he acknowledges now that he 's lucky to be alive
" @entity35 thinks i 'm an idiot , @entity53 's not too proud either , " he says
