-- a @entity2 court granted a stay of execution for convicted murderer @entity5 on monday , giving @entity5 time to pursue dna testing his lawyers say could prove his innocence			1
@entity5 had been scheduled to die by lethal injection wednesday evening for the @entity12 1993 killings of his live - in girlfriend , @entity14 , and her two adult sons in the @entity17 town of @entity18			1
but the state @entity19 halted the proceeding monday afternoon , ruling that it needed time to review the state 's revised law on dna testing			1
in a written statement , @entity5 's lawyer , @entity25 , said the decision " has ensured that mr. @entity5 's request for dna testing will receive the thorough and serious consideration it deserves			1
" @entity5 , now 49 , has strongly denied any involvement in the crime and claims that the dna analysis of untested evidence will not only show him innocent but help determine the real killer			2
he came within 45 minutes of execution in march 2010 before the @entity38 @entity37 stepped in and handed him a legal reprieve			0
as another execution date loomed , his supporters ratcheted up the pressure on @entity2 officials to grant his request for dna testing			1
" executing mr. @entity5 without testing all the relevant evidence would suggest official indifference to the possibility of error in this case and needlessly undermine public confidence in @entity2 's criminal justice system , " former @entity2 gov. @entity46 and 16 other current and former @entity2 lawmakers , prosecutors and judges wrote in an october 27 letter to gov. @entity51 , @entity2 attorney general @entity52 and @entity54 district attorney @entity53			1
@entity25 requested a 30 - day reprieve from @entity51 's office monday afternoon , shortly before the appeals court issued its ruling , arguing that " substantial new evidence " has come to light since his trial to support @entity5 's claim of innocence			1
" physical evidence from the crime scene , witness accounts and expert testimony all demonstrate that mr. @entity5 was so severely impaired at the time of the murders as a result of his extreme intoxication from drugs and alcohol that he would have lacked the physical and mental coordination to perform even simple tasks , let alone commit these three murders , " @entity25 wrote			0
dna tests " could resolve once and for all longstanding and troubling questions about the reliability of the verdict in his case , " he added			0
and in a letter to the @entity92 published sunday , the foreman of the jury that sentenced @entity5 to death urged his execution be stayed " until all of the uncertainty is resolved			2
" " since the trial , i and many of my fellow jurors have grown increasingly concerned that key pieces of dna evidence from the crime scene remain untested , " the foreman , @entity99 , wrote			0
" either the tests confirm @entity5 's guilt or prove his innocence and prevent the state from making an irreversible mistake			1
there is simply no downside			0
" @entity5 admits being at the crime scene when @entity14 and her sons died but said he was passed out on the couch from a combination of vodka and codeine and was too intoxicated to have committed the murders			2
monday 's decision comes four days after the trial court denied @entity5 's latest request for dna testing on a variety of items collected by police , including vaginal swabs from @entity14 contained in a rape kit ; clippings from her fingernails ; two knives , one found on @entity14 's front porch and the second found in a plastic bag in the living room ; a dish towel ; and blood and hairs from a jacket found next to @entity14 's body			1
" all the district attorney has got to do is turn over the evidence and test it , and let the chips fall where they may , " @entity5 told @entity0 's @entity139 in 2009 in an interview from death row at the @entity142 in @entity143 , @entity2			1
" if i 'm innocent , i go home			0
if i 'm guilty , i die			0
what 's so hard about that ? " a federal case in which @entity5 is also seeking the testing has been put on hold pending the outcome of the state court proceedings			1
@entity2 state attorneys argued at a recent court hearing that the testing should not be conducted because there was not a reasonable probability the trial jury would have found @entity5 not guilty if the testing had been done for his trial , @entity25 said			1
@entity53 's office has refused comment on the case , while @entity51 's office referred questions last week to the attorney general 's office , which also denied comment			0
in may 2010 , two months after halting @entity5 's execution , the @entity37 ruled 6 - 3 that @entity5 has a basic civil right to press for dna analysis			1
but @entity2 prosecutors have fought the testing , claiming that @entity5 is not entitled to testing of evidence not analyzed before his 1995 trial			2
forensic evidence gathered at the scene , as well as witness statements , points to @entity5 as the killer , they maintain			0
a female friend of @entity5 's who lived four blocks away testified at his trial that he walked to her mobile home and told her that he may have kicked @entity14 to death , although evidence did not show she had been kicked			2
the neighbor has since recanted parts of her testimony			0
authorities followed a blood trail from the crime scene to the female friend 's home and found @entity5 in the closet , authorities said			0
he was " wearing heavily blood - stained jeans and socks and bearing a gash on the palm of his right hand , " according to the @entity2 attorney general 's summary of the case			0
authorities said cuts on @entity5 's hand came from the knife used to stab the men			2
@entity5 claimed he cut it on glass			0
some dna testing was done , which implicated @entity5 , but not on the items he now wants tested			1
in addition to @entity14 , also found stabbed to death were her sons @entity217 , 22 , and @entity218 , 20 , both of whom were developmentally disabled			0
@entity14 's family , including @entity14 's surviving daughter , believes @entity5 is guilty			0
but they also have pressed state officials to do the forensic testing , saying it would end the years - long delay while @entity5 has pressed his legal claims .			2
