-- the boom in high - quality digital cameras in smartphones and tablets has also created an overwhelming glut of digital images scattered across devices and services			1
the latest company to try and tackle the problem of mountains of digital photos is cloud - storage service @entity13 , which released a new photo and video app called @entity17 that should be available in the @entity19 and @entity20 app stores later wednesay			1
the free app is supposed to act as central repository and gallery in the cloud for all your images			2
@entity17 was just one of a handful of announcements @entity13 made at an event in @entity30 on wednesday			1
it is rolling out @entity19 and beta @entity33 desktop versions of its @entity35 application , a tool for organizing unwieldy inboxes with snooze buttons , swipes and folders			0
@entity13 for @entity41 is coming out of a limited beta and users can now have two separate @entity13 accounts -- one for their personal belongings and one for business documents			1
it packs in features that will make it departments happy , such as remote wipes and audit logs			0
the company also announced that former @entity53 secretary of state @entity52 will be joining its board			0
for regular users , @entity17 is the probably the most exciting new product			0
@entity58 photos are often stored across multiple social networks , computers , hard drives and mobile devices			0
other services have tried to solve the issue in the past with middling success , such as @entity68 's @entity67			0
@entity13 might be in a better position to bring together content from multiple devices and operating systems , and it 's already used by 275 million people			2
@entity17 brings together any images stored on @entity13 with shots taken on an @entity19 or @entity20 device			1
it backs up the full - sized images taken on mobile devices to @entity13			1
the apps sorts them by date and location and includes tools for sharing images in a conversation with friends , and saving images they share with you to your @entity13			2
it was already possible to automatically back up images taken on mobile phones to @entity13 , but the @entity17 app is a new , nicely designed way to sort through those images			1
it frees up space on smartphones and tablets but counts towards the allotted 2 gigabytes of free space on individual @entity13 account			0
anyone can buy more space from the service .			0
