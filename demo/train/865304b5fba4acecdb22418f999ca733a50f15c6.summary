-- hundreds of small earthquakes have rumbled under northwestern @entity2 like a seismic drumroll since midsummer , and in recent days , they have built to a crescendo			1
this does not necessarily mean a big one will come , state seismologists said , but they added that it 's good to be prepared , just in case			2
seismologists refer to such quake groupings as swarms , and the @entity13 has detected them regularly			1
they can produce thousands of small tremors			0
in september , for example , about 500 miniquakes struck southeastern @entity17 in about two days			1
the largest topped out at a magnitude 3.8 -- a strength that could be felt but was not dangerous			2
for months but the @entity2 swarm buzzing in and around the @entity21 has gone on since july 12			2
in recent days -- since october 30 -- they have grown stronger , with three over magnitude 4.0			0
the strongest one weighed in tuesday at magnitude 4.6 -- approaching the threshold of a lightly damaging quake			0
" there is a slightly elevated risk of a larger earthquake while the swarm is active , " said seismologist @entity27 from neighboring @entity28			0
this swarm looks much like two previous swarms that produced somewhat strong earthquakes , the @entity33 says			0
similar swarms in 1968 , in nearby @entity38 , @entity28 , a swarm lasting several months produced three quakes of about magnitude 5			1
" the @entity41 swarm caused moderate damage , " the @entity33 said			0
another , shorter swarm near @entity44 , @entity2 , in 2008 led to a magnitude 5 quake and caused moderate local damage			1
the vast majority of the current @entity2 swarm 's quakes have been undetectable to people walking around on top of them			1
since they started four months ago , @entity33 has recorded around 550 quakes of magnitude 2 or higher , and 42 with intensities above 3.0			1
the center of the activity is in a sparsely populated area , the @entity13 says			0
there are two towns about 40 miles away , each with a population of about 2,500			0

hundreds of mainly low - magnitude quakes have been recorded
such groups of quakes are called swarms
they are *happening* in and around a *national* *wildlife* refuge in @entity2
seismologists record swarms on a regular *basis* ; in september there was one in @entity17
