" he never asked nor accepted any reward , because he was good and simple and did not think that one did good for a reward			0
" ( @entity4 , if this is a man ) @entity7 wanted to keep it to himself			2
how could a man , so famous and so revered , keep it a secret for so long ? " good is something you do , not something you talk about , " @entity7 once explained			1
" some medals are pinned to your soul , not to your jacket			0
" he was @entity20 's very own version of @entity21 -- a man whose personality , character and success transcended sport			1
in the 1930s , @entity7 , a son of @entity27 , was one of the leading cyclists in the world , a man admired by all			1
he had won three @entity33 titles -- one of the three major @entity36 cycling events -- in addition to his triumph at the @entity39 and was very much the country 's poster boy			1
and yet for a man who lived in his life in the full glare of the public , a new film , my @entity20 @entity42 reveals a very different side to @entity7 's remarkable life			1
directed by @entity52 , the film shows how @entity7 was part of a secret @entity20 resistance movement which helped hide the country 's @entity55 during the @entity58 invasion of 1943			1
using the handlebars on his bike to hide counterfeit identity papers , @entity7 would ride to @entity55 in hiding and deliver their exit visas which allowed them to escape transportation to the death camps -- he is credited with saving the lives of 800 people			1
" he never talked about what he did during @entity68 , " said @entity52			2
people loved him , they adored him			0
@entity20 was so proud of him			2
" he risked his life to save others and it 's a story which @entity20 is now embracing			1
" wheels of fortune born in @entity73 in 1914 , @entity7 was a devout @entity74 whose parents were married by the local cardinal , @entity77			2
it was @entity77 who recruited @entity7 into his secret network at a time where much of @entity20 had been ceded to the @entity81			1
in 1938 , @entity20 's fascist regime , led by @entity83 , enacted a series of @entity86 laws which prevented @entity55 from working within government or education , banned intermarriage and removed them from positions in the media			1
while some of the country 's @entity55 fled the country before the outbreak of @entity68 , those who stayed behind remained largely unscathed until the @entity97 began deportations in 1943			1
it was at this time that @entity77 , working with rabbi @entity100 , created a system which involved convents , monasteries and members of the general public hiding @entity55 in all kinds of ingenious ways			2
even after @entity100 was arrested by the @entity97 , deported and sent to his death , the secret network continued to operate			0
using the guise of long - distance training , @entity7 would ride for hundreds of miles delivering documents while the @entity115 secret police simply let him pass given their admiration for the cyclist			1
whenever he was stopped , he would simply ask that his bike not be touched since the technical set up was arranged to achieve maximum speed			0
eventually , @entity7 was forced to go into hiding in the town of @entity123 in @entity124 , where he hid the @entity126 family			2
in the book , @entity130 to valour written by siblings @entity128 and @entity129 , @entity126 recalls how @entity7 's actions helped save his life and the lives of his family			1
" there is no doubt whatsoever for me that he saved our lives , " said @entity126 , who hid in @entity7 's cellar until the liberation of @entity73 in 1944			1
" he not only saved our lives but he helped save the lives of hundreds of people			1
he put his own life and his family 's in danger in order to do so			0
" in my opinion , he was a hero and he is entitled to be called a hero of the @entity20 people during @entity68 " it was not just the rescued who were grateful to @entity7 , those who were involved in creating the counterfeit papers in @entity155 also took courage from the cyclist 's fearlessness			1
worked in the counterfeiting business , @entity159 explained how @entity7 's influence gave him courage at a time where the @entity81 began to get suspicious			1
in the book , road to @entity164 , @entity159 said : " the idea of taking part in an organization that could boast of a champion like @entity7 among its ranks , filled me with such pride that my fear took a back seat			2
" according to @entity175 , the @entity177 museum in @entity178 , 7,680 out of 44,500 @entity20 @entity55 were killed by the @entity81			1
while many @entity20 helped defy @entity181 's attempts to cleanse @entity36 of @entity55 , @entity7 's high - profile meant he risked playing a dangerous game			1
and yet , according to @entity183 , he refused to take any credit for his role in saving @entity55 lives			1
" he was very modest about it , " she told @entity188			0
" he held a profound sense that so many had suffered in a much greater capacity than he had			0
he did n't want to be in the spotlight or diminish the contributions of others			0
" as a cyclist and competitor , he could be a real loudmouth			0
he was very proud and very competitive			0
" but what made him so fascinating , was his other side -- the modesty which he possessed			0
" " @entity201 " in september 2013 , @entity7 's wartime heroism was honored in @entity203 when he was named as a " @entity204 " by @entity175 -- @entity203 's official memorial to @entity177 victims			1
while @entity7 rarely spoke of his actions before he passed away in 2000 , his son , @entity207 , attended the ceremony and met survivors , including @entity126 , who had been helped by his father 's actions			1
it was @entity207 who helped push his father 's war time contribution into the public consciousness following years in secrecy			2
" when people were telling him ' @entity7 , you 're a hero , ' " he would reply , ' no , no. i want to be remembered for my sporting achievements , ' " @entity220 told reporters upon his visit to @entity203 in 2013			2
" real heroes are others , those who have suffered in their soul , in their heart , in their spirit , in their mind , for their loved ones			0
those are the real heroes			0
i 'm just a cyclist			0
" my @entity20 @entity42 has already had a profound affect on @entity20 society			2
its showing at the @entity237 was widely lauded by critics and has helped @entity20 begin to acknowledge its past , according to @entity52			2
" we were overwhelmed by the response the film got in @entity20 , " added the film 's director , whose @entity55 heritage comes through his father 's side			1
" i think this topic had not been touched on or thought about since the war			0
it was a chance for @entity20 to come to terms to get to grips with chapter of history it had n't addressed			2
" having spent a summer in @entity255 as a 19 - year - old , the story of @entity20 's @entity55 and how ordinary @entity20 managed to defy the @entity81 had always been at the back of @entity52 's mind			1
while he spent time learning from some of the great @entity20 directors such as @entity263 ( @entity264 ) , @entity265 ( @entity266 ) , and @entity267 ( @entity268 ) , it was a meeting with a @entity270 filmmaker which left a lasting impression			2
" one day , the professor who ran the course , a @entity270 filmmaker named @entity275 , took me to lunch in a caf√© in the @entity255 ghetto , meters away from a plaque memorializing the roundup of @entity255 's @entity55 in 1943 , " recalled @entity52			2
" he told me how he had survived the @entity281 as a hidden child , protected first by ordinary people and later , by priests in a monastery , who all risked their lives to help him escape			0
" i never thought , back in 1975 , that almost 40 years later i would be given the opportunity to tell the story of @entity20 children who were hidden and saved , along with the story of @entity7 and some of the other heroes who risked their lives to do it			1
" ' @entity294 di k ' while @entity7 's heroics have caught much of the attention , the story of physician @entity296 is equally remarkable			1
it was by chance that @entity52 , filming in @entity255 during an early shoot , came into contact with @entity296 's son , @entity303			0
" we heard that a guy wanted to get in touch with us about the film , " recalled @entity52			0
" so he came and met us for lunch and what he told us was incredible -- absolutely incredible			0
" dr @entity296 was a @entity310 surgeon who worked in the @entity311 on @entity312 in @entity255			0
there he hid hundreds of @entity55 after concocting a tale of a " deadly " disease which had engulfed the hospital			0
" dr @entity296 invented a fake disease to scare the @entity81 off and prevent them from searching the hospital , " said @entity52			0
" he called it ' @entity320 ' and used it to protect the @entity55 people who he was hiding			0
" he would say to the @entity81 , ' hey , you guys can come in but you 'll get this disease and it could kill you '			0
" he saved many people -- but it did n't really hit home until some of those he saved turned up at our screening			0
" @entity7 remained intent on being remembered for his cycling success -- his second @entity335 in 1948 was remarkable given it came a decade after his first victory			1
it was only later on in life after meeting @entity100 's daughter that he agreed to speak about his experiences , though he insisted that he would not be recorded			0
while @entity7 's cycling achievements are remembered each year in an event dedicated to him and fierce rival , @entity344 -- the annual @entity346 race -- his legacy in the wider world lives on			1
" he hid us in spite of knowing that the @entity97 were killing everybody who was hiding @entity55 , " @entity126 's son , @entity349 , says in @entity52 's film			1
" he was risking not only his life but also his family			0
@entity7 saved my life and the life of my family			0
that 's clear because if he had n't hidden us , we had nowhere to go			0
