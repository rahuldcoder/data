@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 is seven years removed from pro baseball , 11 years from his last @entity6 home run			1
but he 's itching to get back on the field			0
three years ago this december , after having a few drinks with friends on his 44th birthday , the car he was driving hit that of 30 - year - old @entity12			1
she died as a result , and @entity3 soon found himself staring down the prospect of up to 15 years in prison after being charged with vehicular manslaughter while driving drunk			1
on saturday , a @entity1 jury decided his fate : not guilty of vehicular manslaughter , though guilty of a lesser drunken - driving charge			1
a bailiff unlocked his handcuffs , and an emotional @entity3 hugged his mother and girlfriend			1
he hugged three of the jurors as well , showing them pictures of the three boys of whom he had primary custody			0
and soon thereafter , he heard from his boys ' baseball program -- which had barred the former @entity31 from being on the bench during practices and games alongside his sons			1
" they ... said , ' ok , springtime , we want you back out here coaching , ' " he said sunday from a @entity0 , @entity1 , youth baseball complex he said he often goes to several times a week with his kids			0
" it 's one of the things i miss the most			0
" after his retirement , @entity3 traded off his athletic celebrity , giving motivational speeches tied to his postseason heroics as well as doing radio and tv work			1
on the morning of december 28 , 2007 , after the crash , he said he was wearing a large @entity6 ring when he told law enforcement officers , " i 'm @entity3 , the baseball player			1
" before he was charged criminally , @entity3 settled a civil lawsuit filed by @entity12 's family , saying he did so out " of the goodness of my heart " to help out the victim 's two children			1
still , he said he feels his high profile worked against him -- and contributed to the vehicular manslaughter charge -- because " people wanted to get their 15 minutes [ of fame ]			1
" well before the trial started this month , @entity3 said he had to breathe into a breathalyzer regularly -- to assure that he had n't been drinking -- at home for three months , temporarily lost his license , then had to breathe into a car breathalyzer every time he got behind the wheel			1
he went through " dui school " as well as nine weeks of counseling , he said			0
because of his legal troubles , @entity3 said he lost his jobs in the media as well as speaking engagements			2
it could have been worse , said @entity3 , had @entity78 not stepped up and helped him pay his bills			2
all the while , the former player said he threw himself into the criminal case , regularly returning to the accident scene , poring over testimony , talking with his lawyer			0
still , @entity3 said he felt helpless as he awaited the verdict of the jury that had , the day earlier , told the judge it was deadlocked			2
" i used to be a catcher , controlling the entire game , before i put my hand down , the game did n't start , " he said			0
" this was totally different			0
this was totally something over which you have no control			0
" prosecutors claimed that @entity3 was legally drunk when he sped through a red light and hit @entity12 ; the defense countered that @entity12 did n't have her lights on and that the light was yellow when @entity3 drove through			1
a defense expert , dr. @entity106 , testified that @entity3 told him he had seven drinks shortly before the crash , a number that the defendant said was n't right but " a number we had to use			2
" jury foreman @entity111 told @entity2 's sister network @entity112 that , while all six people quickly agreed @entity3 was n't guilty of the greater charge , they felt compelled to hold him responsible on some grounds			1
" are we going to go in front the public and say it 's ok to have four or five drinks within an hour or so period of time and then hit the road ? i think that was the deciding factor , " he said			0
yet one juror , @entity122 , said she had also wanted to acquit @entity3 of the lesser drunken driving charge			1
she told @entity3 , who came over to show the jurors ' pictures of his three boys after the verdict , that she changed her mind to avoid a hung jury that may have led to another trial			1
" the thought of it going into another trial later and you possibly being convicted of manslaughter , when we were n't doing that , i could n't let that happen , " @entity122 told @entity3			1
jurors said they did n't believe the defense 's argument that the crash occurred 10 minutes earlier than investigators had said			0
but they also said that they did n't believe @entity3 ran the red light , and said that @entity12 's drinking -- her blood - alcohol level was 0.18 , more than twice the legal limit -- and the fact she was n't wearing a seat belt were critical factors in her death			2
the victim 's husband , @entity153 , left the courtroom with his parents , saying only that @entity3 " did n't get what he deserved			2
" @entity3 's legal travails are n't over ; prosecution and defense attorneys will meet december 1 , to settle on a sentencing date on the drunken driving charge			1
but the most jail time he could face is six months , far short of what could have awaited him			0
and for now , @entity3 is free on bond and required to breath into a device every time he gets behind the wheel			2
speaking sunday , the day after the verdict , @entity3 said he has some bitterness : toward the prosecutor , over the fact he had not been able to see his brother before he died of @entity175 , and because his children had to go through the whole ordeal			2
since it 's an anniversary of the crash , he said every birthday will remind him of @entity12 " and i 'll say my prayers and condolences			0
" still , @entity3 said that the entire thing will be worth it , if his and @entity12 's story might convince someone not to drive after a few drinks			0
and he said that it 's also strengthened his faith , and made him all the more grateful to be free and with family			0
" the difference is , you come home and your little 9 - year - old boy comes up to you and says , ' @entity198 , it 's over , ' " he said of his relief after the verdict			0
" i was fighting for these three boys , who needed their father			0
" in @entity202 's @entity201 contributed to this report .			0
