-- @entity1 found his formula through trial and error			2
a design student at the @entity6 , he was aiming to produce an artistic exhibition for a module on sustainability , when he stumbled on " @entity10 , " a living alternative to concrete			1
a lab technician introduced @entity1 to @entity14 , a bacterium with binding qualities , sometimes used to solidify soil to hold road signs in place			2
the student tested it with one of the world 's most abundant resources - sand			1
pumping bacterial solution into a sand - filled mould , he added nutrients , urea derived from urine as fertilizer and calcium			1
after a year , and hundreds of failed experiments , this process manufactured a stool around 70 % the compression strength of concrete			1
the process requires less than one - sixth of the energy used in concrete production , and is completely biodegradable			1
crucially , @entity1 believes his mechanism has the added benefit that it could be employed by anyone , anywhere			2
" once you have the basic framework it should be transferable			2
imagine a tsunami - hit farm in @entity47 that is not getting supplies			2
you could use sand and bacteria on site , practically free , and have shelter housing that is far more permanent			1
" @entity54 is working with ngos to apply @entity10 to @entity57 settlements and insecure regions of @entity59			2
but while the applications are new and experimental , the concept of growing the material for our built environment is increasingly regarded as not merely interesting , but essential			1
according to the @entity67 @entity66 , the construction industry accounts for 40 % of the world 's @entity69 emissions , 40 % of @entity67 landfill and has been uniquely resistant to change			1
concrete , bricks and cement have remained the dominant materials since the industrial revolution in the early 19th century , and as pressure mounts on resources and climate , scientists and architects are looking to the natural world for solutions			1
building bacteria bacteria have been at the center of alternative methods			1
@entity87 start - up @entity88 is growing bricks on an industrial scale , cultivated from sand by microorganisms			1
the company has won major prizes and funding for the bricks , which will be used in a structure for the first time this year in a pedestrian walkway , ahead of building projects across the world			1
similar processes are being developed to build in the most challenging environments			2
@entity104 architects see an opportunity to cultivate new life in deserts , while @entity108 believe bacteria could allow the construction of bases on other planets without the headache of ferrying the material there			1
while bacterial processes save heavily on carbon , there are concerns that by - products could be poisonous			0
but another living brick -- made from mushrooms -- has no such problems			1
functional fungus @entity126 firm @entity125 are producing materials that combine agricultural waste products such as corn stock with mushroom mycelium -- the roots of the vegetable			1
over five days the mycelium binds the waste to create a block with a stronger compressive strength than concrete , with none of the heat or energy required by regular bricks			2
the product is in commercial use for packaging , producing thousands of units a month , and the company is expanding into construction			2
@entity125 believe that in addition to being renewable and decomposable , natural properties give them a performance advantage			0
" it has great insulation properties " , says @entity151 , @entity125 director of sustainability			0
" a key benefit is flame resistance -- without adding any chemicals we were able to achieve a @entity159 fire rating "			1
there is scope for development			0
@entity163 effectively dies once its growth is complete , but @entity151 is looking ahead to material that does not			0
" we are exploring ideas of living materials , perhaps that are self - healing or respond to leaks with indicators			1
" @entity125 are in dialogue with major construction companies , and the material will soon be tested on a historic scale			1
a collaboration with architects @entity177 won the prestigious @entity180 ( @entity180 ) @entity182 - 1 competition , and their creation will be installed in the museum courtyard this summer			2
growing for gold " @entity189 " will be the largest ever grown structure , and first large building to claim zero carbon emissions			1
it will be formed of three 40 - foot spiral towers constructed from the mushroom material , with varying properties of brick to maximise light and ventilation			0
the material 's versatility offers unique design opportunities , says @entity200 , lead architect of the project			0
" you can dial in almost any performance you want			0
you can mix and match a variety of properties such as water resistance or uv resistance , lightness or durability			1
you can grow the bricks in almost any shape " @entity200 says the bio-bricks could be made to last as long as traditional materials , but believes architecture must embrace temporary structures			1
" it 's essential to recognize that not all materials should last for centuries			2
a lot of the steel in our buildings will last longer than we need			0
our idea is a building that be made locally and quickly , and then have a plan for when the life of the building is over			1
" future applications would include pop - up stores , festival " tents " and emergency shelters , says @entity200 , but there are greater hopes for the material within the industry			0
stronger than concrete " i could imagine every structure you would built out of bricks " , says @entity238 , assistant professor of architecture and construction at the @entity241 in @entity242			1
" no high - rises , but smaller scale structures and houses			0
the material is stronger than concrete , with better insulation capacities "			0
the challenge will come in commercializing the products , @entity238 feels			0
" there is huge demand for alternative materials			2
the question is how easy it is to penetrate the existing market			0
this needs time and a couple of buildings to show the possibilities "			0
stealing from nature another , more radical approach takes the material from nature but also allows it to build the structure			0
@entity270 , director of @entity271 , is a leading figure in biomimicry , having previously applied natural processes to create man - made forests in @entity276 and the @entity277			2
his latest project to grow a " small venue for spoken word performances " from undersea biorock was recently unveiled at the @entity282 in @entity283			0
" in biology , complex structures achieve resource efficiency by putting things in exactly the right place , which is very difficult with made materials " , says @entity270			1
" our ways should deliver significant resource savings			0
" drawing on the natural accumulation of coral reefs , his team would install a steel frame in the deep ocean and leave it to attract material			0
growth would be focused on specific areas of need using an electrical current			0
" we 're interested in looking at its structural growth patterns			0
we have stress gauges on the structure to measure force in particular areas			0
if one is highly stressed , we can input more current so the rate of deposition matches the force			0
" @entity270 believes the structure could be built within two years , for consideration at scale			0
as with @entity125 , a key challenge ahead is to integrate still - living material to allow intelligent biosensors that respond to the building occupants			1
innovators in this space acknowledge the ongoing barriers presented in an industry that has resisted modernization			0
but from rock to fungus , sand to space dust , the use of materials and processes designed by nature herself offer both a solution to the sustainability crisis , and a glimpse of our new built environment : clean , efficient , and alive			1

@entity104 student invented new process of growing building materials using bacteria and sand
other living bricks made of mushrooms are soon be *widely* tested by @entity67 architects
new bio bricks offer flame , uv , and water resistance without adding any chemicals
their use can prove crucial for life in deserts or construction of bases on other planets
