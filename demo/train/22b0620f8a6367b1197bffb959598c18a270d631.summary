-- as a gay black man who came of age just before the 1969 @entity5 riots , i 've seen far too many examples of the inequalities that exist in @entity8			1
but i 'm also highly encouraged by recent developments : same - sex marriage support from president @entity11 and the @entity12 , and a wave of federal court rulings -- from the @entity15 being deemed unconstitutional to the rejection of @entity18 's @entity17 -- that have opened a promising new chapter in the gay rights movement			1
all of this suggests that after many , many years , we are finally piercing the stigma surrounding being gay in @entity8			1
now let 's talk about erasing the stigma of hiv / aids			2
right now , 1.2 million @entity8 are living with hiv / aids			1
i am one of them			0
first , the good news : thanks to advances in medical treatment and technology , a positive hiv status is not the death sentence it was considered to be 20 years ago			0
recent data suggest that a 25 - year - old diagnosed with @entity34 and no other complicating symptoms , who immediately enters into comprehensive and adherent medical care , can expect to live more than 50 years beyond his or her diagnosis			1
this is roughly the same life expectancy as someone who does not have @entity34			2
on the other hand , without the proper medical care , the life span of that same 25 - year - old is reduced dramatically			0
currently , only 19 % of @entity8 living with hiv / aids are receiving the sustained care they need to extend and improve the quality of their lives			1
with 50,000 new @entity8 cases confirmed every year , that 's a problem			1
and in a global superpower , it 's unconscionable			0
news : 25 years later , @entity60 quilt displays an @entity62 tragedy the reasons are complicated , ranging from the challenges borne from living in poverty ( it 's hard to prioritize your health care when meals and housing are more pressing ) to a lack of @entity34 - experienced medical experts in rural areas			1
these are complex hurdles , and the solutions wo n't come easily			0
but there 's one that will , if we all do our part			0
stigma -- stemming from shame , fear of discrimination or a basic lack of understanding about the disease -- is all too often a major reason people living with hiv / aids fail to get tested or get into life - saving care and treatment			1
and its impact is devastating			0
through @entity95 's work with organizations around the country that provide access to care to those living with hiv / aids , the stories we 've heard are heartbreaking			1
stories like the grandmother who was afraid to hug her 25 - year - old hiv - positive grandson			0
the young man who was fired from his job because his boss found out he had @entity34			2
the single mother and her young son , both hiv - positive , who were forbidden to swim in their community pool			0
@entity114 up shame over hiv / aids in 21st - century @entity8 is not just a nice thing to do			1
it will lead more people to get tested			1
it will help them improve and save their lives			0
and it will prevent more transmissions			0
news : gay , bisexual black men at high risk for @entity34 on sunday , 20,000 of the world 's hiv / aids experts will gather in @entity131 for the @entity132 -- an opportunity to create a blueprint for wiping out the disease for good			1
an important preconference panel will focus on the shame and stigma burdening men who have sex with men , particularly @entity62 men who are still silent or in denial about same - sex attraction			2
we will discuss new approaches for persuading them to come forward , get tested and access the care they need to make @entity34 a manageable , rather than a fatal , condition			1
but our work should n't be done in a bubble			0
everyone has a role to play in bringing @entity60 out of the shadows : -- we must keep educating the everyday " influencers " -- the pastors , the beauticians , the shop owners -- anyone with a direct line to the communities at greatest risk who can launch straightforward , ongoing conversations about the disease and how to prevent it			2
health : @entity167 approves @entity168 for prevention of hiv / aids -- we must continue to educate policymakers about the impact of hiv / aids on their constituents			0
@entity176 and state budget cuts have hurt vulnerable populations affected by @entity60 and have eliminated evidence - based programs for preventing transmission			2
-- we 've moved beyond @entity181 as our only pop culture point of reference for this disease			2
other athletes and entertainers have come out in support of @entity60 - related causes over the years , but we still need more of them to leverage their celebrity and keep this issue at the forefront of media attention			2
for the first time in a generation , we have the tools we need to end the @entity196			0
now we need to use them			0
news : @entity60 activists arrested after hoisting banner near @entity201 as the world 's attention focuses on the @entity132 , let 's all show our support			1
let 's work together to reverse the shame that still shrouds the disease after all these years			2
let 's work together to end the @entity196 in @entity8			1
