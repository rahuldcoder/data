none of the players or team officials have been arrested , but four were questioned by police , @entity15 national team manager @entity16 said sunday			1
another man was arrested saturday and released on bail sunday			0
the news has stunned @entity5 , where cricket is " not just a passion , it 's a religion , " said the op - ed editor of a leading newspaper in @entity28 , @entity5			1
" this is tantamount to treason for a cricketing nation like @entity5 , " said the journalist , @entity29 , saying : " people here are devastated " by the allegations			2
" we may have our differences otherwise in day - to - day life , but cricket brings us together regardless of caste , creed , religion , or class structure , " she explained			2
" if the allegations are proved , the players should be banned from playing this ' gentleman 's game ' for life			0
" a @entity48 tabloid newspaper reported sunday that two @entity15 players deliberately bowled " no balls " -- a foul -- during the four - day series			1
a " no ball " is when the bowler -- the equivalent of a pitcher in baseball -- steps over the line as he unleashes the ball			0
the batting team gets a run when that happens			0
the @entity48 tabloid @entity64 posted what it said was a video of an undercover reporter meeting with a man identified as @entity69 , who tells the reporter exactly which bowlers would bowl " no balls " and when , then lays out 14 thick stacks of bills on a table			1
the video of the meeting -- which the newspaper said took place wednesday , the day before the match between @entity5 and @entity1 began -- is intercut with clips from the following two days , where the players perform as @entity69 said they would			1
the tabloid also says the alleged ringleader pocketed 150,000 @entity48 pounds ( @entity86 $ 232,800 ) in the scam			1
@entity0 's @entity88 said a 35 - year - old man was arrested late saturday on suspicion of conspiracy to defraud bookmakers and released on bail sunday			2
police said no date had been set for a hearing or further proceedings , but that the investigation was continuing			0
a source familiar with the investigation named the man who was arrrested as @entity69			0
can @entity100 survive in @entity5 ? police questioned @entity15 team manager @entity16 , captain @entity102 , and two other players , @entity16 told reporters sunday			1
he did not name the other two players at the news conference , but @entity48 's @entity107 earlier reported that he had said they were bowlers @entity108 and @entity110			1
police refused to confirm to @entity8 who was being questioned			0
the @entity15 players at the center of the scandal are free to leave the country , @entity0 's @entity88 said monday			1
team captain @entity102 said @entity5 gave 100 percent throughout the match			1
" we have given our best , " @entity102 said after his team lost to @entity1			2
the team manager refused to comment on the report that @entity15 players intentionally committed three fouls during the match			1
" no allegations are true until they are proved either way , " said @entity16			0
" so that this point in time they are just allegations			0
let 's wait until the case is complete			0
" @entity1 beat @entity5 in the four - day match at @entity132 , which ended sunday afternoon , after the scandal broke			1
@entity5 's president @entity136 ordered an investigation into the scandal , his spokesman said sunday			2
he directed the chairman of the @entity140 to submit a preliminary report " immediately , " @entity142 said , adding that @entity136 asked to be kept informed about any @entity48 investigations as well			2
@entity144 , @entity64 's cricket correspondent , told @entity8 that the tabloid did not " drive these events ... these events were going to happen regardless of whether the @entity64 was involved			2
" but , he said , staffers believed the story was in the public interest			0
" it 's a legitimate story to get to the bottom of something that 's been plaguing our sport , " he said			0
" ... it 's swirled around , and the innuendo 's been there			0
" however , @entity161 , president of the @entity162 , told @entity8 that while he is " shocked " at the news , " no proof has been given of the involvement of these players in the match - fixing issue " and he has seen no concrete evidence against the cricketers			1
he said if evidence does surface , an investigation will be launched			0
it is the second allegation of corruption directed at the @entity5 cricket team this year			2
@entity64 does not allege that gamblers fixed the results of the @entity1 match -- only that specific moments in the match were fixed , a practice known as " spot - fixing " rather than " match - fixing			1
" betting on cricket matches is legal in @entity1			2
the @entity64 report was co-authored by @entity186 , a controversial figure in @entity48 journalism who has used undercover video in the past			0
he was responsible for a report in may that revealed duchess of @entity195 @entity194 offered to sell access to her former husband , prince @entity197			0
@entity8 's @entity204 , @entity198 , @entity199 , @entity200 , @entity201 , @entity202 and @entity203 contributed to this report .			0
