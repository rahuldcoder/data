@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 president @entity3 appeared to endorse talks between the @entity5 and the @entity6 that could lead to the opening of a @entity6 liaison office in @entity9			1
@entity3 's announcement wednesday followed news a day earlier from the @entity6 that it tentatively agreed to open an office in @entity9 's capital city of @entity14 to facilitate talks on the @entity1 conflict			1
it appears to be the first time the @entity6 -- who ruled @entity1 from 1996 until 2001 , when they were ousted in a @entity5 - led invasion -- have offered talks without the condition of an @entity5 withdrawal from the country			2
" @entity1 , to save the country from war , conspiracies , the killing of innocent @entity1 and to reach peace , agrees with the talks between @entity5 and @entity6 that will end up in establishing an office for @entity6 in @entity9 , " @entity3 said in a palace statement			1
in the statement , @entity3 appeared to broadly endorse peace negotiations for a country that has been embroiled in more than 30 years of war			0
it was unclear what , if any , outcome there would be in talks between the @entity5 and the @entity6 as @entity3 , top @entity1 peace officials and the @entity5 have all previously said that talks had to take place between @entity1			1
" the @entity46 of @entity1 with an emphasize on its firm position yet again , believes that talks and negotiation are the only way to reach peace and to come out of the atmosphere of war and imposed violence on @entity1 nation , " the palace statement said			0
recent media reports have said the @entity5 and other foreign governments with a stake in the @entity1 war may try to strike a separate deal with the @entity6			1
the @entity60 reported in december that the @entity62 administration reached a tentative deal with @entity6 negotiators that would have included the transfer of five @entity1 from @entity66 , and the @entity6 's public renunciation of international terrorism			0
the deal collapsed , the @entity60 said , because of @entity3 's objections			0
any talk of a peace process slowed in september , when suicide bombers killed senior @entity1 peace negotiator and former president @entity75			0
@entity76 , a member of @entity1 's @entity77 has called peace talks " an @entity1 process " and warned against the @entity5 or other nations trying to strike their own peace deal with the group			2
@entity76 said a @entity6 office in @entity9 would by no means legitimize the @entity87 group			2
@entity3 told @entity2 in december that the government can not hold talks until the @entity91 militia identifies a representative with the authority to negotiate .			0

@entity3 appears to endorse opening of @entity6 office in @entity9
