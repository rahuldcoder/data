-- a @entity2 mother on friday asked for forgiveness and mercy , in the eyes of @entity6 and a judge , after pleading guilty to two counts of murder for killing her two toddler sons -- saying she hoped to someday reunite with them , " even though it 's not on this side of eternity			1
" " i know what happened is ... unusual and it 's not my character , " a tearful @entity15 said in an @entity17 court after entering her plea			1
" i do n't know what went on with me			0
" authorities have said that on the night of august 15 , 2010 , @entity15 suffocated 2 - year - old @entity24 and 1 - year - old @entity25 by putting her hand over their mouths in a room at the @entity29 just outside @entity17			1
she then put their bodies into their car seats , drove across town to a boat ramp , put the @entity36 sedan in neutral and sent it into the @entity38 , they said			1
@entity15 's then - 5 - year - old daughter was not with them at the time			2
@entity42 sheriff @entity41 said soon after the incident that authorities believed the deaths were " a direct response " to an argument between @entity15 and her mother , who lived together , the night before			1
" i believe she was just fed up with her mother telling her she could n't take care of the children , " @entity41 said			2
the next month , @entity53 described her daughter as " a very loving and kindhearted person " and a " good mother " during a court hearing to consider whether the suspect should be granted the opportunity to post bail			0
" my daughter has never been in trouble with the law until now , " @entity53 said			0
speaking in court friday , @entity15 did not delve much into her rationale beyond saying , " i know i was depressed for a long time , and i hurt for a long time			2
" she also did not deny any facts as presented by law enforcement , apologizing to her family and " to this community , to this court ( and ) to this state for all that has happened			0
" but , pointing to her lack of a criminal record , she insisted , " i 'm not a bad person at all " and " i have a good heart			0
" @entity15 also said she prays every day for the opportunity " to keep ( her sons ' ) memory alive by sharing the love that i have for them			1
" " my heart hurts every single day because i do not have them anymore , " she said , addressing judge @entity83			0
" i miss them so much , your honor , and there 's nothing that can fill that void			0
" @entity93 solicitor @entity92 pointed out that there was no plea deal , as @entity15 pleaded guilty to the charges filed			1
" i wanted to make sure @entity15 was held accountable for the horrific death of these two boys and that she pled to murder as she was charged , " @entity92 said			1
" i was not willing to plead this case to any charge that carried less than 30 years in prison			1
" @entity15 is expected to be sentenced during the week of march 26 , according to @entity92			2
the judge could sentence her to 30 years -- assuming the two sentences are served concurrently -- to a maximum of life in prison without the possibility of parole , @entity92 said			1
even with a less stringent sentence , @entity15 would get no credit for good behavior or a chance at early release on parole			2
a month after her arrest , @entity15 's lawyer , @entity116 , argued then that his client was suffering from mental illness			0
he called her " a very quiet , reserved , caring and fun - loving person who ... was going through a very tough time , " citing the deaths of two family members , a bout with bone cancer and the challenge of being a single mother			0
@entity130 's @entity129 contributed to this report .			0
