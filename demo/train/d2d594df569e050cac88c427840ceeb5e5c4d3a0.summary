-- @entity1 scored a sensational second - half hat - trick as @entity3 beat 10 - man @entity5 3 - 0 on sunday , but they remain behind @entity7 leaders @entity8 , who beat @entity10 4 - 1 in the late match			1
after a goalless opening 45 minutes at the @entity12 , the introduction of substitute @entity14 turned the game , with the @entity17 's pace and guile causing chaos in the @entity5 defence , allowing @entity1 to take full advantage with three superb goals			2
the opener came in the 56th minute when the 22 - year - old @entity24 somehow weaved his way past three defenders before slotting home from a tight angle			0
@entity5 then missed a golden opportunity to level when giant striker @entity31 was foiled by goalkeeper @entity32 after being put clean through			0
then , just a minute later , the visitors had @entity34 sent off for two bookable offences on @entity1 -- leaving gaps at the back that @entity3 exploited			0
@entity1 curled home his second goal with nine minutes remaining and just a minute later @entity5 's defence parted again to allow @entity1 to chip home a delightful third goal			2
@entity5 remain third despite the defeat , but they are now a massive 18 points off the lead , leaving the title race very much a two - team affair			0
despite the victory , @entity3 remain behind bitter rivals @entity8 on goal difference after @entity51 's side recovered well from their @entity53 exit to @entity54 in midweek by thrashing @entity10			1
striker @entity56 emulated the feat of fellow - @entity58 with a hat - trick , with @entity60 netting the opener courtesy of a trademark free - kick , as @entity8 remain top by virtue of having a two - goal better goal difference			1
elsewhere , @entity66 improved their chances of reaching the @entity68 with a 2 - 0 home win over @entity70 -- avenging their 2 - 1 defeat to the bottom side last october .			1
