they know all about the birds and the bees			1
the last thing i should be worrying about is their sex lives			1
when your kids are 23 and 26 , the operative words are : " @entity14 out			1
" looking back , i can say in full confidence that i taught them well about sex : be responsible for your actions and protect yourselves			2
say no if you want to			2
tell me just enough , but not too much			2
the goal is to forge a meaningful relationship with someone who is both lover and friend			1
that was before " @entity24 " came along			1
my daughters did n't have the patience to read the novel , as famous for its female fans as for its pathetic prose			1
chances are , though , they 'll go see the movie , slated for release on @entity32			1
they admit , the catchy , sexy trailer piqued their interest			1
all the buzz about the movie brings up a dilemma for me as the parent of two girls who are grown , but still forming their sexual identities : do i really want my daughters seeing a warped , sadomasochistic relationship , dressed up as a @entity44 love fantasy ? i 'm no prude , mind you			1
as a parent , i 'm chill , i 'm open			1
but the idea that my daughters would see the romance in " @entity24 " as something to be aspired to makes me just a little uncomfortable			1
i had the passing thought that " @entity24 " could be a learning experience			1
but then i woke up and thought : not for my kids ! â € ¯ here i am trying to teach my daughters to be strong women and look at sex in a healthy way			1
now they 're being told that for a woman , the secret to really great sex is pain , and plenty of it			2
who 's in the ' @entity24 ' cast ? plenty of people are hating on the film 's ultraviral trailer -- perhaps for the wrong reasons			1
these critics think the stars are n't attractive enough , old enough , or edgy enough			2
some say leading man @entity74 , especially , does n't seem " in charge " enough to play sadistic - sexy @entity24			1
even the bondage community does n't seem particularly happy about the book or movie			2
in anonymous @entity81 murmurings , some say despite all the trappings , " @entity24 " depicts an assault on a woman , rather than consensual bondage			1
still , the mere appearance of the trailer set " @entity24 " fans aquiver			1
it got 25 million @entity91 views in just the first three weeks			1
the slick , highly produced trailer , complete with soundtrack by @entity96 , appeals to the younger female demographic , says one film industry analyst			1
" they 're going to totally chase the female millennial audience , no doubt about that , " says @entity98 , senior media analyst for @entity99			2
" if you look at the number of tweets , the prerelease buzz surrounding this movie , it 's almost like how ' @entity110 ' was for young women			2
it 's almost like their ' @entity113			2
' " psychologist @entity114 , author of " @entity115 : a crash course on @entity119 with @entity120 , " agrees the movie seems to be targeting a young female audience			2
" the male lead is pretty and nonthreatening , even though we 're clear he has his ' naughty ' side			2
young women audiences gravitate toward pretty male singers and actors			2
just check out who 's selling music and movies to young women and you 're going to encounter a sea of pretty men			2
" and what is the film telling its potentially young , overwhelmingly female audience ? that submission is the ultimate goal ? that 's certainly at odds with what i 've tried to instill in my daughters -- express yourself , be strong and do n't let anyone make you do anything you 're not comfortable with			1
@entity114 also has her doubts			2
" i do think that it insidiously affects young women , by kind of creating this super , super expanded idea about sex , " @entity114 says			2
" this movie is clearly going to depict a sexual relationship that is out of the box			0
i think it 's better for young people to establish their identity in their own box before they go outside of it to explore @entity44 ideas of what sexuality is			0
" " as a psychologist , i would be more concerned about a young woman with less maturity , self - knowledge and clarity exploring the behavior , potentially to please a partner or as a way of acting out poorly understood psychological pain / confusion			0
in such cases , sexual shame could be triggered and emotional turmoil could follow			0
" explaining the wild success of ' @entity24 ' it 's for that reason that @entity114 says she 'd rather her 16 - year - old daughter not see the movie			1
" my 20 - year - old can do what she wants			0
she 's been in the culture long enough to roll her eyes and laugh at it			0
" in other words : what 's the big deal ? it 's not like young women look up to @entity24 , the " @entity24 " heroine			1
" she 's not really a role model , " my 23 - year - old says			0
" people are exposed to things at a much different speed in this day and age than in the past , " says @entity192 , a psychotherapist and clinical social worker			0
" at the end of the day , everything is ok between consenting adults			0
is there a reason for young girls , specifically , to not see this stuff ? the answer is , it really depends on the girl			0
" perhaps , @entity208 says , the sadomasochism scenes in " @entity24 " will prove more challenging for a male audience			1
" it 's more intimidating to men than to women			0
it portrays a sexual man as someone who acts that way , " she adds			0
" they might end up going to the movie with their girlfriend , hoping for soft porn			0
but that 's not what they 're going to get			0
what they 're going to get is much more demanding			0
" very little is really , truly , off limits these days			0
girls much younger than my daughters will surely find a way to see " @entity24 " -- either in theaters , on cable , or online			1
what 's unknown is just how profoundly it will affect their emerging sexuality			0
my daughter 's 21 - year - old roommate , @entity237 , is a big fan of " @entity24 " and other romance and erotic novels			1
@entity237 found the trailer disappointing			1
" i just do n't think the actors seem like they 're really into this			0
it 's almost like they @entity246 'd it			0
" meaning , it 's not dirty enough ? no , @entity237 says			0
" i think they 're trying to get the 15 - year - old girls who are obsessed with ' @entity251			0
' it brings up this whole fangirl thing			0
the same girls that like @entity256 , like ' @entity251			0
' i 'm concerned about it becoming something that it 's not			0
the sex is more than the love			0
that 's what i like about the book , " she says.â € ¯ " now they 're going to make it into a movie , they 're going to idolize ( @entity24 ) , but in reality , he still likes pain			1
" my youngest daughter is all in			0
" everyone 's obsessed with this			0
" she admits the movie would n't be as popular if the lead roles were reversed , with the man submissive to the woman			1
" we live in a society that caters to male pleasure , " she expounds			0
when i asked if it mattered to her if i did n't want her to go , she shot back : " you ? no. " how 's that for a slap in the face ?			0
