-- " hello ' true believers , ' this is @entity5 , " said the world - renowned comic book creator as he filmed a video segment for @entity4			1
his booming voice and magnetic demeanor made jaws drop and eyes widen everywhere in the room			0
there 's something magical about @entity5 : he is like a superhero disguised in a button - down shirt and tan slacks			1
@entity5 played a major part in creating most of the world 's favorite comic book superheroes			1
he conceived of -- or co-created -- and wrote decades of story lines for @entity22 , @entity23 , the x-men , the @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 and plenty others in the @entity32 pantheon			1
all told , he has contributed to 90 percent of the company 's comic book characters and made them recognizable through marketing and licensing			1
@entity5 said the secret to taking his superheroes through so many successful forays into different mediums was having fun			1
" i never really think of which [ business offers ] to take and turn down , because almost everything that 's offered to me sounds like fun , " he said			2
" i like writing , i like trying to create new characters and new concepts for entertainment			2
i 'm very much a ham , i love doing those cameos i do			0
so , i turn down almost nothing unless there 's no time to do it			2
" @entity32 became known for its collaborative creative efforts ( called the " @entity56 " ) and @entity5 sees it as one of the reasons his characters have been so memorable			1
" all of my life in comics i have worked with artists , so i 've collaborated with them , " said @entity5			2
" i would write down the original story , they would draw it and then i would edit it and do the art direction			0
so everything i 've done has always been a collaboration			0
" i feel , when you collaborate with talented people , they inspire you			0
i would hope that you spark them also			0
and i find that working with people whom you respect , and who are as eager as you to do things that will excite an audience , that 's just the best way to go			2
i 've been so lucky that i have found and worked with that caliber of people , " he said			0
he points out that his latest venture , @entity81 ! @entity82 , stands for " @entity83 ! with an exclamation point ! " his exaggerated speech patterns and confident posture make it hard to comprehend that he is nearly 88 years old			2
if it 's a carefully crafted persona , it 's based on his hard - earned legacy			1
through his prolific work and desire to entertain , @entity5 has influenced pop culture for 71 years			1
he started working as a writer and proofreader in 1939 for the comic book company that would become @entity32			1
he wrote his first entire comic book ( captain america no. 3 ) in 1941			1
by the early 1960s he was editor and chief writer at @entity32 , leading what became known as the " @entity32 revolution			0
" in response to @entity105 ' re-vamped version of " @entity106 " and successful superhero team comic , " @entity111 , " @entity32 created a group of superheroes			1
they were distinguished in the comic book world for their complex narratives and continuity -- they all saved lives in the same world , and in some cases crossed over into each other 's storylines			1
but it was @entity5 's promotion and licensing of those characters that gave them a lasting influence			1
since 1965 , @entity32 superheroes have jumped from the pages of comic books to costume and toy stores , saturday morning cartoons and blockbuster movies			1
he 's not afraid to tackle serious issues either			2
he famously took the @entity137 to task over rules banning the depiction of drug use			0
he used " @entity144 " to discuss the social problems of drug abuse in 1971			0
despite the @entity137 's disapproval , @entity5 published the three - book story arc anyway , illustrating the havoc that @entity148 could wreak			1
it was so well received that the @entity137 changed the rules			0
many of @entity5 's superheroes and villains are complicated characters , allowing him to weave social discussions into comic book story lines			1
" i thought , even though these were action stories for comic books , i thought it would be rather interesting to the readers to have a third dimension to the stories , which i 've always tried to do in a subtle way , " he said			0
" inject a little bit of philosophy or a little bit of something to think about when the reader reads the stories			0
" x-men characters " @entity171 " and " @entity172 , " for example , struggled with opposing philosophies as mutant outsiders who were persecuted -- even outlawed -- which was a struggle that comic book readers could see similarly played out in real life on the evening news			1
" they were meant to emphasize the conflict between people who felt that we 've got to all work together and find a way to get along , and people who feel ' we 're not treated well , therefore we 're going to strike back with force ! ' " said @entity5			2
" with @entity172 , whose people were hounded and hunted and almost tortured , he had every right to feel , ' we 're trying to help mankind , and they 're making us outlaws , and they 're persecuting us , we 've got to strike back			0
' " @entity5 said he could understand that feeling , but could also understand @entity171 's point of view , which was " no , we 've got to give them time to learn and to understand and to cooperate			1
" for all his success and fame and fortune , @entity5 reaches out to fans in a very personal fashion , fostering an in - the - club - like feeling while at @entity32			1
in all his comics , he wrote a column called , " @entity204 , " as well as a page called " @entity204 , " in which he wrote directly to the reader , more like a letter from a friend than a letter from the editor			0
" and i would end my columns with little catch phrases , like ' until next time , gang , hang loose ! ' or ' face front ! ' things like that , " he said			0
" and i found , little by little the competition was using the same phrases			0
and i did n't like that ! so , i thought , ' i 'm going to try to dream something up that @entity222 ) they wo n't know what it means , and b ) they wo n't even know how to spell it ! ' " the catchphrase " @entity228 ! " -- which @entity5 pronounces egg - zel - see - or -- was born			1
@entity5 said he found the word on the coat of arms of the state of @entity232			2
it 's an old @entity234 expression that means " upward and onward to greater glory ! " said @entity5 , emphatically			1
" and i thought , " he said , " that 's just perfect ! so now i end almost everything that i write , when i 'm just talking to the public or to fans , i end it with ' @entity228 ! ' and so far nobody has copied it			2
but of course now that i 'm mentioning it here over the air , everybody is going to start doing it and i 'm going to be sorry i said this			0
" @entity5 makes many cameo appearances in movies based on his comic books			1
he has appeared uncredited as himself in movies like 2007 's " the @entity25 : rise of the @entity252			2
" he also makes more scripted appearances			0
finding him in @entity32 - based movies is almost like playing " @entity255 ? " in 2000 's " x-men , " he was a hot dog vendor			1
in 2003 's " @entity23 , " he was a security guard			0
in 2005 's " @entity25 " he appeared as @entity257			0
in 2008 's " @entity26 , " @entity26 mistakes him for @entity259			0
" wow ! if i could be in a movie called ' @entity261 ' and play all the cameos i 've done , that would be my superpower			0
i have the ability to be anyone , anytime , anywhere , anyhow ! " said @entity5			2
" as soon as i get back to the pow ! offices , and you know , you know the power that pow ! wields , i 'm going to start working on that			0
" " that is , after i work on getting the movie academy to issue an @entity274 for the best cameo of the year , and of course the television academy to do likewise , " he said .			0
