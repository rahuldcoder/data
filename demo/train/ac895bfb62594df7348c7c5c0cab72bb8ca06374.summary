has written to motorsport 's governing body about the 2011 race calendar amidst a backdrop of confusion over the re-instated @entity8 @entity7			1
@entity1 confirmed to @entity0 they had sent a letter to the @entity10 ( @entity10 ) and the @entity11 discussing the season 's schedule , after the recent decision to stage the @entity8 race in october			1
the original event was canceled in march due to ongoing civil unrest in the @entity19 kingdom but @entity20 , former head of the @entity10 , told @entity0 tuesday that he would be " astonished " if the grand prix went ahead			2
@entity20 said any change to the race calendar would have to be unanimously supported by all 12 @entity7 teams -- something he thought was highly unlikely			0
@entity20 : @entity8 @entity7 will not go ahead @entity1 supremo @entity27 also admitted to @entity0 in @entity28 that he was unsure whether the race would go ahead			1
when asked if @entity7 could take a stand against the violence in the country he said : " i think it would be difficult to do that , but i think we 'd have to -- sort of -- do something that would keep everybody peaceful			0
" @entity39 driver @entity38 criticized the @entity10 's decision saying on his personal web site : " i 'll be highly surprised if the @entity42 goes ahead this year			0
" in a statement , @entity1 confirmed to @entity0 : " the @entity44 have discussed the 2011 calendar within @entity1 and have expressed their views privately in a letter to the @entity10 , @entity48 ( @entity48 ) and the @entity11			1
" @entity49 is the next stop on the schedule for @entity1 , as they prepare for this weekend 's @entity52 , where questions over the @entity8 race will remain high on the agenda			2
the @entity57 @entity56 reported tuesday that the @entity1 letter demanded the @entity10 abandon plans to return to @entity8 due to " logistical and safety concerns			1
" they also claimed the plan to switch the @entity63 @entity7 to the end of the season , in december , in order to accommodate the @entity8 race was " unbearable to our staff			2
" on tuesday , @entity20 told @entity0 there was little chance of the @entity42 going ahead and claimed there would be no serious damage done to the sport 's reputation if the @entity10 were to swiftly cancel plans to return			1
he said : " when you 're going to change something in the middle of the season , like the proposal to move the @entity63 race for example , that needs the unanimous agreement of all the teams			0
i do n't think there 's the slightest chance of that actually being given			0
" the teams have complete power in this particular case because although the governing body can cancel an event for reason of force majeure - as happened in the case of @entity8 -- when you want to put an event on or move an event , that 's a change to the conditions under which the teams entered for the season and that 's like any contract -- you can only change it if both sides agree			2
" all 12 teams would have to agree to change the @entity63 date and go back to @entity8 , so it only takes one team to say ' i do n't agree ' and that 'll be the end of it			0
it would not be possible for it to happen			0
