-- police in @entity3 's capital tuesday made a u-turn , saying a ban on protests in support of the more than 200 girls kidnapped in april does not exist			1
the ban was issued one day earlier by commissioner @entity9			2
" @entity12 wishes to inform the general public that the @entity14 has not issued any order banning peaceful assemblies / protests anywhere in @entity3 , " his office said in a statement			1
" it notes however that against the backdrop of current security challenges in the country , coupled with a recent intelligence report of a likely infiltration and hijack of otherwise innocuous and peaceful protests by some criminal elements having links with insurgents , the police only issued advisory notice , enjoining citizens to apply caution in the said rallies , particularly in the @entity32 and its environs , " the statement read			1
on monday , the commissioner said the proliferation of such protests was " posing a serious security threat " in the capital city of @entity37			2
" information reaching us is that too soon dangerous elements will join the groups under the guise of protest and detonate explosive ( s ) aimed at embarrassing the government			0
accordingly protests on the @entity50 is hereby banned with immediate effect , " his office said in its original statement			2
more than 200 schoolgirls were kidnapped in northern @entity3 in april by @entity53 , an act that drew international condemnation			1
the terror group abducted an estimated 276 girls on april 14 from a boarding school in @entity59			1
dozens escaped , but more than 200 girls are still missing			1
@entity3 and others have accused their government of not acting swiftly or efficiently enough to protect the girls seized in the dead of night			1
authorities ' apparent change of heart came after an outcry on the part of protesters			0
one group , # @entity71 , threatened legal action			0
" @entity75 is legitimate and lawful and can not be arrested by the police whose responsibility is to enforce , not betray the law , " it said in a statement			2
an adviser to @entity3 president @entity81 sought to explain the apparent contradiction			1
" this present administration has never , ever tried to violate anybody 's rights			0
we believe in human rights , we believe in citizens ' rights , " @entity86 told @entity0 's @entity87			0
" the police command has come to further clear the statement			0
" " the ban that the commissioner of police in @entity37 proclaimed is like asking people , look , before you go on a protest , you have to come to the police , to come and clear with the police and let us work together to ensure that nobody 's life is in danger , " he said			1
@entity53 translates as " @entity107 education is a sin " in the @entity110 language			0
the militant group says its aim is to impose a stricter enforcement of @entity115 law across @entity3 , @entity117 's most populous nation , which is split between a majority @entity119 north and a mostly @entity122 south			2
the military actually knows where the girls are , " but as you will understand , you just can not storm a place like that , " @entity86 said			0
he added : " i believe that by @entity131 's grace , we are very near the end of this whole unfortunate saga			0
" @entity0 's @entity134 , @entity135 and journalist @entity136 contributed to this report .			0
