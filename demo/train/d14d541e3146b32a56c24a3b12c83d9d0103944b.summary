-- two cable powerhouses have announced an ambitious pilot program that aims to convince their customers that , actually , tv on the web should not be free			1
@entity6 , chairman and ceo of @entity8 , speaks at the @entity10 conference in @entity11			2
with a service called @entity14 , @entity12 and @entity8 will give cable subscribers access to " premium " television content via broadband , and later cellphone connections			1
to begin with , 5,000 @entity12 subscribers will begin testing the system next month , giving them access to @entity8 's @entity24 and @entity25 channels on their computers , and the same channels ' video - on - demand catalogs on their cable boxes			1
if you made peace long ago with the idea of paying a monthly cable bill , this probably sounds great			0
it means watching your existing subscription on new screens without paying additional fees or buying more hardware			0
( of course , as consumers adopt tv everywhere , they can probably expect price increases			0
) but if you prefer to watch your television for free on ad - supported sites like @entity46 while paying only for the internet connection that delivers it , you could be in for a rude awakening			2
@entity14 represents an alternative -- and possible threat -- to the popular @entity46 model			1
if the pilot program impresses the group -- and proves to other networks that its user - authentication system is secure -- @entity12 and @entity8 expect the other television programmers , @entity58 and mobile providers to join , giving all cable subscribers a way to watch the content they pay for on their televisions using any broadband - connected computer or authenticated cellphone			1
already " at least 92 percent of @entity67 qualify to watch this for free online , " according to @entity6 , chairman and ceo of @entity8			1
for these subscribers , tv everywhere represents a potential win			1
the only question is whether they will keep paying for the old cable subscription model as their viewing habits shift online			2
there 's nothing to stop television networks from putting their content on both @entity46 and tv everywhere , because @entity14 's contract will be non-exclusive , according to @entity6			1
however , given the choice between @entity46 and tv everywhere , television programmers have an incentive to go with the latter			2
only the tv everywhere model promises to port yesterday 's lucrative business model onto today 's platforms			2
and that , according to some critics , is exactly the problem			0
" [ @entity14 ] raises substantial anti-competitive issues by restricting the availability of programming to the favored distribution methods , " said @entity96 , president and co-founder of the public interest group @entity98			0
" under the tv everywhere plan , no other program distributors would be able to emerge , and no consumers will be able to ' cut the cord ' because they find what they want online			2
as a result , consumers will be the losers			0
" in addition , we are concerned that this program violates the open nature of the internet			0
by adding this additional toll lane , @entity12 and @entity8 want to create their own ' managed channel ' within the internet and turn the internet into their own private cable channel			1
" so , what about @entity46 ? will its deals fall through given this new option ? " there will be some part [ of @entity8 's content ] that will be out there [ on @entity46 ] , said @entity6			1
" short - form content , i think , will continue to be available -- promotional content will continue to be available			0
" however , only cable subscribers will be able to access other content online -- through officially licensed avenues , anyway			1
@entity6 added that some other television programmers have avoided @entity46 " for security concerns and because they did n't like the model , " but that they will give tv everywhere a chance			1
" consumers vote every single month with their pocketbook , " he added			0
" they do n't have to subscribe to cable			0
they do n't have to pay for these services , yet they do			0
the number of people paying for subscription television has gone up and up and up every single quarter that we 've been in the business			0
