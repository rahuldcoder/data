-- experts are always looking for creative ways to increase awareness about public health problems			0
a new idea from the @entity6 has definitely caught some people 's attention			2
in an effort to combat fetal alcohol syndrome , researchers are planning to install free pregnancy test dispensers in the bathrooms of some bars			1
@entity15 has the highest reported rate of fetal alcohol syndrome in the @entity18 , according to a 2010 report by the state 's @entity20 and @entity22			1
health officials estimate that in @entity15 , 126 babies born each year are affected by prenatal alcohol use ( out of roughly 731,000 people in 2010 , one of the lowest state populations )			1
however , most states do n't have comprehensive data about their rates , making it difficult to draw national comparisons			2
fetal alcohol spectrum disorder is an umbrella term used to describe the range of possible lifelong effects from prenatal alcohol exposure , such as physical , mental , behavioral and / or learning disabilities			1
fetal alcohol syndrome and spectrum disorder are often used interchangeably			1
the university 's two - year , $ 400,000 program begins in december and will be studied closely			2
pregnancy test dispensers will be placed in bars that are frequented by women 21 to 44 in six regions of the state			1
in different bars within the same areas , printed warnings will be posted to provide a control group for the researchers			2
both methods will include a toll - free number , website and qr code to complete a short survey about knowledge and prevention of fetal alcohol syndrome			1
the surveys are site specific , so the university will be able to measure results for each location individually			2
staff will also conduct interviews with bar patrons and staff to analyze the use and effectiveness of the dispensers and confirm the survey results			0
the hope : pregnant women stop drinking that night the researchers believe offering free pregnancy tests in bar restrooms will encourage women to use them and , if they are pregnant , stop drinking that night			1
" this is a rigorous pilot study to evaluate community based intervention , " said @entity81 , director of the @entity6 's @entity82			2
" it 's only part of a much larger set of initiatives			0
" questions have been raised about the effectiveness of the program and whether it 's worth the cost			0
will a free pregnancy test really be used at the bar and stop someone from drinking ? opponents criticized @entity15 state sen. @entity100 's program proposal , saying the money would be better spent on giving away condoms or contraception at bars to prevent unwanted pregnancy			1
@entity100 argued the pregnancy tests will be available to help responsible citizens			1
" if you know you 're pregnant , you wo n't drink			0
that is true for much of the population , " the @entity110 senator said in an interview with the @entity112			0
" birth control is for people who do n't necessarily want to act responsibly			0
" the paper argued many people using birth control are acting responsibly			0
depending on what stage of her pregnancy she 's in and how often a woman drinks , fetal alcohol syndrome can cause , among other things , abnormal facial features , brain damage , hyperactivity , difficulty with judgment and motor skill impairment , according to the @entity133			1
the @entity136 , @entity134 and the @entity18 surgeon general all agree that women should avoid alcohol during pregnancy , since no amount has been determined to be safe			2
approximately 40,000 babies are born with fetal alcoholism in the @entity18 , according to the @entity136			0
' why take the risk ? ' alcohol is harmful to a fetus or embryo at any time -- even before a woman knows she 's pregnant , said the @entity149			0
" we know that alcohol is a neurotoxin , and we know that it crosses the placenta , " said the organization 's president @entity150			0
" why take the risk ? " although not involved in the project , @entity150 is eager to monitor the outcome , and based upon the attention this strategy has gotten , he has high hopes for its success			0
until now , fetal alcohol syndrome prevention has relied on advisories and labels , which people are n't inclined to look at			1
but this creative approach , he says , comes without finger - wagging			0
" if a woman chooses to drink or not is based on the moment , " he said			0
" it 's not a broad admonition			0
" study : paying more for alcohol saves lives @entity180 , founder of the nonprofit organization @entity181 , started a similar pregnancy test program in @entity183 and is a consultant on this project			2
he manufactures and is providing the dispensers and tests , both which include information about fetal alcohol syndrome prevention			1
less than two years after the first dispenser in @entity183 was installed , there are now 10 dispensers located in bars , a youth center and even a convenience story by a community college			0
@entity180 has also moved his project into @entity199 and is in talks with universities in other states about similar studies			0
" we 've experienced success so far , but what we need now is empirical , gold standard research , " @entity180 said			0
the @entity6 's study will be able to gather the necessary data to provide tangible results			2
there 's no numerical data to measure the success of the program , but @entity180 said the $ 3 pregnancy tests in @entity183 are being utilized and replenished			1
the @entity15 study hopes to determine how many women taking the tests actually stop drinking during their pregnancy			1
@entity15 falls slightly below the national average for alcohol consumption in women ages 18 to 44 , according the the @entity136			1
the state leads the country in rapes , at almost triple the national average			2
@entity15 also ranks in the top 10 for alcohol abuse , with just over 21 % of adults reporting binge drinking habits			1
both of these factors likely contribute to the high rate of fetal alcohol syndrome among @entity15 residents , experts believe			1
while it 's certainly generating a buzz , experts believe that this program has a strong potential for positive results			0
the university 's study will provide research and quantitative data that could change the face of fetal alcohol syndrome prevention on a national level			1
change the list : the rapist next door			0

in december , the @entity6 will offer free pregnancy tests in bars
@entity15 has one of the highest rates of fetal alcohol syndrome in the country
this state - *funded* effort will measure the effectiveness of tests
