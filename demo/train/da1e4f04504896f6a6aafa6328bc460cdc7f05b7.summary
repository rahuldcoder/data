@entity0 -- @entity2 , @entity3 , @entity4 , @entity5 , and @entity6 all played international football for @entity0 in the 1980s			1
but , as well as being teammates for their national side , the players also share another common bond -- each one of them has fathered a child that suffers from mental health problems			1
the players say they suspect this is no coincidence , more a direct consequence of taking performance - enhancing drugs while playing for their country , without their knowledge or consent			1
@entity20 is a respected figure in @entity0 sport			2
he is president of the @entity23 , but was once doctor for the national side			2
he admits that suspicious practices occurred during the 1980s			2
" when @entity28 @entity27 took over as coach in 1981 , i was not allowed to take a look at the medical records of the players any more , " @entity20 told @entity1			1
" i suspected he was trying to do some suspicious tests , and this is why i submitted a detailed report to the national center of @entity0 sports and medicine and the ministry of sports			1
" but they asked me not to interfere in the work of the @entity28 team , which is why i decided to resign			1
" whether the coaches used drugs on the players , and whether that affected their children negatively is something i can not confirm			1
but nonetheless , @entity28 were known in the late 1970s and early 1980s for their suspicious behavior on the sport field			1
" @entity20 added : " it is not necessarily true that these drugs had a direct effect on the children , but if we look at the whole situation we 'll find that most players ' children have some mental issues			1
" @entity27 , who is no longer alive , led @entity0 to a famous victory over @entity62 at the 1982 @entity63			1
@entity1 's efforts to reach any doctors who worked with the @entity0 team at that time proved unsuccessful			1
but could these players and their families merely be victims of coincidence ? professor @entity71 , a senior scientist at the @entity72 in @entity73 , doubts that any performance - enhancing drug or steroid could be transferred to offspring in such a manner			1
" it is possible you can take a drug that would cause mutations of dna and therefore result in children being born with disabilities , " @entity71 told @entity1			2
" but i think it is extremely unlikely that this would happen -- and i know of no drugs or substances that would be used to enhance sporting prowess that could be transferred and therefore cause these abnormalities			2
" like @entity20 , none of the players can prove there is a direct link , but they want answers to what has happened to their children -- and it is their words that are most poignant of all			2
@entity3 had three daughters who all suffered mental health problems , with one of them , he says , dying as a result of her condition			0
" nobody can understand our suffering , " he told @entity1			0
" i am shocked because i never took drugs in my life -- unless of course i was given them without our knowledge and that the @entity28 coaches knew it			1
" he added : " some years later , i met with some of my former teammates and we discovered that we were all in the same situation : me , @entity2 ( his daughter ) , @entity4 ( a son ) , @entity5 ( three sons ) and @entity6 ( daughter )			0
we all played at the same time , so we decided to make it public , and find out why			0
" none of the players would elaborate on those mental issues , which is not uncommon given cultural taboos surrounding the issue in that part of the world			2
@entity130 ' son @entity129 is now 12 years old			0
" when he was born , i said , ' this is our fate , and we should accept it , ' " @entity4 told @entity1			0
" it did not come to my mind that this could be something related to drugs , until i met up with the other guys			0
" i remember the @entity28 doctors who used to supervise our treatment during training sessions ; all we cared about was playing and winning			1
i know it will be difficult to reveal the truth without sufficient evidence , but opening an investigation is very important			0
" @entity2 also wants answers			0
" i believe in fate , but having the same mental problem among everyone in the team is something very strange , " he told @entity1			0
" i do n't understand what dr. @entity20 said in terms of not allowing him to view the files , which means that a group of people were doing something in the dark , but we will not stop asking for our right to know			0
" he added : " my second daughter , @entity159 , was born in 1989			0
when she reached school age , she said to me : ' why ca n't i go to school like other girls ? ' i did not know what to say , so i held her and cried			0
" is there anyone in this world who prefers money and fame and have some unhealthy children ? i do n't think so , so we need immediate answers from authorities			0
we know that reopening this case is difficult , but we need to know the reasons that made us reach this point			0
