@entity1 ' season took a turn for the worse when he was forced to withdraw from the @entity4 at @entity5 just 11 holes into his first round on thursday			1
a 14 - times major tournament winner , @entity1 pulled out of the @entity10 event when back spasms became such a problem that playing partner @entity13 had to pick up his tee for him on several occasions			1
the struggling 39 - year - old was making his second @entity18 start of 2015 and had been on two over par when forced out of the event			1
last year , @entity1 underwent surgery on a pinched nerve			2
his first start , at the @entity24 last week , saw him chalk up the worst score of his professional life in the 1,267th round of his career			1
former world @entity29 -- now at 56 in the standings -- recorded an 11 - over - par 82 at @entity32 in @entity33			1
that meant he missed the cut , finishing bottom of a field of 132 as his short game fell apart and he racked up six bogeys , two double bogeys , a triple bogey and two birdies			0
the @entity44 website quoted him as saying that a delay to the start of his round in @entity10 , caused by foggy weather , had been behind the back problems that forced him out			1
" my glutes are shutting off , " explained @entity1			0
" then they do n't activate and then , hence , it [ pain ] goes into my lower back			2
" i tried to activate my glutes as best i could , in between , but they never stayed activated			0
" i had a good warm - up session [ before the weather delay ] , but then we stood out here , i got cold and everything started deactivating again			2
" it 's frustrating that i just ca n't stay activated			0
that 's just kind of the way it is			0
" @entity13 said he had become aware of @entity1 ' increasing discomfort as the round progressed , adding : " if i did n't see it on 10 , i saw it on 11			1
then i asked him when i walked off the 12th tee : ' back hurting you again ? ' he said : ' spasms			2
' " what happened in @entity10 will inevitably raise questions about where @entity1 goes from here as one of the game 's all - time greats battles for full fitness and form			1
@entity13 expressed his sympathy , saying : " it 's unfortunate , because i consider him a friend and i want to see him get back to his level of play that we all know he can			2
" if he can just stay healthy and be able to work on it , i think we would see the results			0
" in november , @entity93 -- who has not won a major since 2008 -- was in the spotlight for his angry response to a parody interview by veteran @entity98 writer @entity97			0
the second golf course created by his design business is due to open at @entity102 , @entity103 , later this year			0
in an exclusive interview , he told @entity2 : " my goal is to design a limited number of distinct and memorable golf courses			0
