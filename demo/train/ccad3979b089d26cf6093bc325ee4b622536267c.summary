@entity0 -- any day now , the @entity2 is due to give birth to her and prince @entity5 's first baby -- a new heir to the @entity7 throne			1
it is an event that has been eagerly awaited since @entity10 's pregnancy was announced last december , but what will happen once the baby arrives ? @entity1 runs through the expected schedule , although as with all births , be warned that anything can happen			1
where will the baby be born ? @entity10 is expected to give birth in the private @entity19 at @entity20 in @entity21 , central @entity0 -- the same place where both @entity5 and prince @entity23 were born			2
the world 's media -- @entity1 included -- are already staking out their positions in view of the hospital 's front door , to try and ensure a front - row seat when the baby makes its debut in front of the cameras			2
if @entity10 goes into labor while visiting her parents at @entity38 in @entity39 , she may instead opt to give birth at the nearby @entity41 in @entity42 , where she herself was born			0
will prince @entity5 be there for the birth ? prince @entity5 serves as a search and rescue helicopter pilot in the @entity47 , and is based at @entity48 on @entity49 in @entity50 , about four and a half hours ' drive from @entity0			0
like many other fathers - to - be in the military , he will not be taking time off before the baby 's arrival , but when @entity10 goes in to labor , it is expected that he will be flown by helicopter to @entity59 in order to be at his wife 's side as soon as possible			1
@entity10 's mother , @entity63 is also likely to be on hand at the hospital , in case @entity5 is unable to make it to @entity0 on time for any reason			0
who will be the first to know about the birth ? once the royal baby is born , @entity72 , @entity7 prime minister @entity73 , and the @entity74 of each of the @entity77 nations will be informed , along with the rest of the royal and @entity63 families			1
if the baby arrives in the middle of the night , it seems unlikely that the 87 - year - old monarch will be woken up , so there is a chance that in the event of an overnight delivery , an announcement would not be made until the following morning			0
when will the rest of the world know ? after the baby is born , an official notice confirming the newborn 's gender , weight and the time of its birth will be signed by @entity10 's doctors			1
a palace official will bring this document out of the hospital -- this is the first indication the world will get that the royal baby has arrived -- and hand it to a messenger , who will take it to @entity107 , under police guard			1
at the palace the notice will be put into a gilt frame , which will be positioned on an easel -- the same one that was used to announce the birth of prince @entity5 -- and placed in the palace forecourt			2
this is the first time the world will know the gender of the baby			0
however , it could take anything up to 10 days before the new arrival 's name is announced			1
after the birth is announced , prince @entity5 is expected to make a statement outside the hospital , as are @entity2 's mother and father , @entity63 and @entity128			1
celebratory gun salutes will be sounded by the @entity130 in @entity131 ( 41 rounds ) and the @entity133 at the @entity134 ( 62 rounds )			0
what will happen after the birth ? in keeping with tradition , as she leaves @entity20 , @entity10 is expected to appear on the steps of the building with her newborn , as princess @entity142 did with princes @entity5 and @entity23			0
the next stop for the new family may be the @entity72 's estate at @entity146 in @entity147 , @entity148 in @entity149 , or even the @entity151 ' home village of @entity38 , in @entity39 , but exactly where the baby will spend its first weeks is being kept a closely - guarded secret			1
in the longer term , the royal couple plan to set up home at @entity59 , but they are not expected to move in there immediately			0
@entity10 and @entity5 are said to be set on giving their baby as normal an upbringing as possible , and are reportedly not planning to employ a nanny -- though of course they have plenty of other staff to lend a hand			0
considering the duchess came from a relatively ordinary background , it is not surprising they would want the same for their child -- as much as is feasible for a future @entity7 monarch , of course			2
@entity1 's @entity175 and @entity176 contributed to this report .			0

@entity179 and @entity2 are eagerly awaiting the birth of their first baby
royal *protocols* and traditions govern how the new royal arrival is announced
@entity72 , @entity7 *pm* , and baby 's *grandparents* among first to hear news
@entity192 will be told of baby 's birth via note on an easel outside @entity107
