-- @entity2 gov. @entity1 has decided to send 1,000 @entity4 troops to " secure " the @entity7 - @entity6 border			1
at least 52,000 children have arrived unaccompanied to the @entity7 since october , most coming from @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11			1
they have been greeted by protests in border regions across the @entity7			1
but military might has n't ever and wo n't solve the problem ; it is much broader than that			0
what has been glaringly absent from discussion of this humanitarian crisis is any attempt to address its underlying causes , which rest fundamentally in drug policy reform			1
at its core is the longstanding drug war the @entity7 has waged in @entity27			1
in the early years of the drug war , @entity7 policy was aimed at curtailing the rise of socialism and communism as well as stopping the production of narcotics in this region			1
the @entity7 has used military intervention , crop dusting and possible political subversion in order to achieve these policy objectives			1
more recently , the @entity7 implemented a militarization campaign , providing funding to law enforcement officials in @entity27 countries to combat narco - trafficking			2
this policy destabilized major regions of @entity48 , increasing murder rates and corrupting any viable political or economic opportunities to bring about change			0
corruption in government and law enforcement results in an environment of extreme violence , as gangs of criminals battle for control across borders			0
parents in these countries are faced with deciding whether to send their children on the treacherous journey to @entity27 , where they have at least a possibility of safety and a better life			1
we can not just summarily send these children back to the desperate situations they escaped			1
two @entity2 lawmakers are trying to do just that , quickly , by introducing legislation to amend the @entity74			2
the bill , which has been met with protests , would speed up the deportation process and send these 52,000 children back to the violent environments they escaped			2
sen. @entity80 and rep. @entity81 even have the audacity to call it the @entity83 , for " helping @entity84 and alleviating a @entity85			0
" @entity87 gov. @entity86 was right when he recently said : " it is contrary to everything we stand for as a people to try to summarily send children back to death			1
in a place where drug gangs are the greatest threat to stability , rule of law and democratic institutions in this hemisphere			0
" although the arrest of a drug lord or corrupt government officials may catch our attention , we fail to sufficiently consider those throughout @entity27 who have fallen victim to violence related to the drug war			2
so many have been murdered , have disappeared or have been forced to leave their homes in search of refuge			0
in 2010 , nearly 50,000 @entity115 were incarcerated for nonviolent drug offenses and , according to a recently released @entity118 report , nearly one - quarter of a million people were deported for nonviolent drug offenses in just the past six years			0
nearly 10,000 were deported in 2013 for marijuana - related offenses			0
prohibition and the failed drug war has led to more than 60,000 deaths in @entity6 from 2006 to 2012			2
as the region that has most suffered the brunt of the war on drugs , it is no surprise that the loudest political voices calling for reform are coming from @entity27			2
leaders within @entity27 countries have been on the record in recent years calling for this change			0
in a groundbreaking report released in 2011 by the @entity137 , three former @entity27 presidents -- @entity139 of @entity140 , @entity141 of @entity142 , and @entity143 of @entity6 -- and a host of other notable global figures , such as @entity146 , @entity147 and @entity148 , called for " breaking the taboo " on discussing alternatives to drug prohibition and encouraging " experimentation by governments with models of legal regulation of drugs			0
" now , sitting presidents @entity158 in @entity142 , @entity159 in @entity9 , and @entity160 in @entity161 have echoed these demands for reform			0
in may , the @entity164 released a report , commissioned by the presidents of the hemisphere , which included marijuana legalization as a probable policy for the near future			0
it is no doubt that as the war on drugs grinds on in @entity27 , women and children will continue to seek refuge from the violence			1
as the @entity7 considers options on how to deal with its new influx of thousands of young refugees , it must strongly reconsider the drug war policies that put us here in the first place .			1

@entity2 gov. @entity1 wants to send 1,000 @entity4 troops to " secure " the border
**writers** : to fix the crisis you must address its cause : the war on drugs
they say *lawlessness* threatens children *'s* lives at home so they flee to safety
**writers** : @entity7 can not send kids back to violence and must reconsider its drug policy
