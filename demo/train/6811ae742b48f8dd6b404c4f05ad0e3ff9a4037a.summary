@entity0 , @entity1 -- retiree @entity3 says he often turns off the television when the attack ads appear , and he hangs up the phone when it 's a presidential campaign calling			0
" i want to make my own independent decision , " @entity3 said in a lunchtime conversation this week at @entity8 and @entity10 's @entity9			2
" i do n't want anybody shoving stuff down my throat			2
" four years ago , @entity3 recalls being " fed up with @entity15 " and intrigued by the idea of being part of history			0
" i voted for mr. @entity19 , " he said			1
" it was something different for the country			0
something that had n't happened before -- a black president			2
i got caught up in that a little bit			0
but i think he is a disappointment			0
i do n't see jobs coming back			1
the housing market is coming back a little bit			2
but unemployment is still way above where it should -- where he predicted it would be			0
" yet this self - described independent is n't sold on @entity36 , either			1
at this point i do n't know who i am going to vote for			1
" why do you identify as an independent ? his choice could go a long way in deciding who wins @entity1 and the @entity44			2
do the math : @entity2 's @entity47 calculator then - sen. @entity19 in 2008 ended a streak of 10 consecutive @entity50 presidential wins in @entity1 , and he did it by winning big in the northern @entity1 suburbs within an hour or so drive from the nation 's capital			1
in @entity56 -- the local shorthand for northern @entity1 -- the president had a 234,000 - vote margin over @entity50 nominee @entity58			1
in the rest of the state , the two split the vote evenly			1
" it 's all about @entity1 , " said @entity1 - based @entity50 pollster @entity63			1
" so many people have moved into @entity1 , particularly from the @entity66 -- @entity68 areas -- that they 've turned a solid red state into a purple state			1
" @entity36 campaign reports massive fund - raising haul @entity68 rep. @entity73 is one of those transplants ; he moved to the area from @entity76 years ago while working as a staffer on @entity78			1
now , his district sits in the suburbs that have the potential to ruin @entity36 's night even before the polls close in the @entity83 and @entity84			1
" a lot of people are focused on @entity91 , but i really think it is just as conceivable that , frankly , the epicenter of this outcome is going to be right here in @entity1 , " @entity73 said in an interview at an @entity19 campaign office in the heart of @entity88			1
" these 13 electoral votes are pretty critical			0
" by the numbers : swing states it 's a tossup heading into the final days			0
@entity63 likes the trend line			0
" if you look at the dozen polls in @entity1 taken before the first presidential debate on october 3 , @entity19 was ahead in all 12 , " @entity63 said in an interview at his office in @entity103			1
" if you look at the eight polls taken after the first presidential debate , @entity36 was ahead in six of the eight			1
" clearly the momentum is going in @entity36 's direction			1
is it enough to win ? we 'll find out			0
" polls : dead heat in @entity117 ; @entity19 with slight advantage in @entity119 @entity19 advisers are more worried than they were just weeks ago , and some privately say it does look more likely that @entity36 will eke out a @entity1 win			1
but @entity73 is betting against it			0
he said the @entity50 ' effort to sound a more moderate tone of late is smart strategy , but he predicts it wo n't work			1
" i think there is a trust factor with that , " @entity73 said			0
" my constituents remember the @entity50 primaries			1
they do n't suffer from amnesia			2
i think that 's a tough sell for @entity36			1
" spend an hour at @entity8 and @entity10 's and it 's obvious the president retains deep suburban support			0
but there also is evidence of doubts that give @entity36 the opening to at least cut into the president 's margins here , something he must do to have any chance of winning statewide			1
@entity148 is a registered @entity149			1
but she is voting @entity50 for president			1
now that 's not a lost vote for @entity19 -- she voted @entity50 in 2008 , too			1
@entity19 campaign reports $ 90.5 million haul in start of october still , not bringing her back into the @entity68 fold could ultimately hurt			1
" mr. @entity19 promised so many things that i did n't believe he could do it , and he has proven he could n't do it , " @entity158 said			1
" i 'm going to vote for @entity36			1
i have confidence in him			0
he has proven that he knows business and he makes it work			0
" like @entity3 , @entity158 is no fan of the attack ads. but she said living in the pivotal area of a swing state makes it impossible to escape the campaign			2
" two or three times a week we will get a phone call , " she said with a roll of the eyes			0
" i also got two ads yesterday out of the mailbox			0
" @entity3 said you can escape it " if you turn off the tv			0
i see enough of it on the news every night			0
i just want to be able to sit back and clear my head and read			2
" by reading , he means news articles and other research he gathers on the candidates			0
little - known candidates could harm @entity36 , @entity19 bids he may be doing his best to ignore it , but both campaigns are working the state feverishly in the final days -- knowing their get - out - the - vote effort is likely to determine who wins this hotly contested battleground			1
both claim the ground war edge			0
the @entity19 campaign 's case : more than 60 field offices across @entity1			1
grass - roots organizing dating back to early 2009			1
a 19 % increase in the number of @entity206 registered to vote since 2008 , and a 7 % increase of @entity209 registration			2
just shy of 60 % of those registering to vote in the last two months are younger than 30			2
the @entity50 's counterargument : more than 1 million door knocks			2
improved absentee and early voting numbers from 2008			2
@entity3 will cast his ballot the old fashioned way : in person on @entity219			0
" it 's the economy -- jobs , " he said of the overriding issue			0
" i think the upper - income people should pay a little more			0
that 's where i flip on the @entity19 side on this thing			2
by the same token , i see the big picture			0
i just think we need a change			0
" if he had to vote today ? " i 'm pretty much undecided			0
it 's kind of scary			0
i thought i would have been there by now			0
but i will be by @entity219			0
" could @entity19 's struggles with white voters cost him the election ?			2

self - described independent disappointed with @entity19 but not sold on @entity36
@entity149 did n't vote for @entity19 in 2008 because she did n't think he could keep promises
@entity50 pollster says transplants have turned *traditionally* red state into a purple state
@entity68 *congressman* says @entity36 image from primaries will come back to haunt him
