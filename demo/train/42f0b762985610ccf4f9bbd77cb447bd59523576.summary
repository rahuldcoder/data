while he said he did n't know whether the now - debunked storyline helped him place second in @entity22 voting , he insisted his emotions surrounding @entity26 's loss were authentic			0
" what i went through was real			0
you know , the feelings , the pain , the sorrow -- that was all real , and that 's something that i ca n't fake , " he said			1
