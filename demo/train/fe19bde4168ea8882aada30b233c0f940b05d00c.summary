-- @entity1 have sacked manager @entity2 , the first @entity4 dismissal of the season			1
the 51 - year - old @entity2 led the club back to the @entity4 at their first attempt , following relegation the previous season , and had guided them to 11th place in the table			1
the @entity12 have produced some superb results in recent weeks , notably a 1 - 0 victory at @entity15 and a 5 - 1 destruction of north - east rivals @entity17			2
however , sunday 's 3 - 1 defeat at @entity19 meant the club have now gone five games without a win , although they did claim a 1 - 1 home draw with @entity24 during that period			1
explaining their decision , the @entity1 board of directors issued a statement saying : " the board now feels an individual with more managerial experience is needed to take the club forward			0
" @entity2 , who became @entity1 's eighth manager in six years when he was promoted from first team coach following the club 's relegation in 2008 - 2009 , had never held a managerial post before			1
however , he proved a popular figure with @entity1 supporters , who have been critical of owner @entity42 's running of the club in recent years			0
the mild - mannered @entity2 , who has worked without an assistant since october , was unusually angry following sunday 's loss to @entity19 , locking his players in the changing room for an hour after the match			2
however , his post-match media comments made little indication that he was expecting to be sacked			0
@entity1 have put former player @entity51 in temporary charge ahead of an appointing @entity2 's replacement			0
meanwhile , @entity55 side @entity54 have sacked coach @entity56 after a run of 11 league games without a win which has left them fourth bottom of the table			0
the club have picked up only three points in the last three months and saturday 's 3 - 0 defeat at leaders @entity65 proved the final straw for the board .			2
