-- with fuel prices still high enough to put a hole in your pocket , where does one turn ? @entity8 's @entity7 division is the best average fuel - economy automaker			1
for some , it 's a vehicle that 's been engineered to sip , not guzzle			0
the question then : which brand is more likely to ease you out of the gas station without feeling you 've been turned upside down and shaken ? perhaps surprisingly , it 's not always the @entity18 - based carmakers that come up on top where fuel economy ratings are concerned			1
a look at the @entity24 government 's official fuel economy ratings ( published by the @entity25 , the @entity26 and the @entity27 ) might not be light reading , but it does give a new sense of perspective on what is a very complex issue			1
one observation : carmakers are , on the whole , doing a pretty good job of bringing choice to the market when it comes to fuel economy			2
@entity41 autos : best - selling fuel - efficient cars there may , however , be two races to win : the most fuel - efficient car on the road and the automaker that " on average " is most likely to save you money at the pump			1
@entity41 autos : fuel - efficient used cars for sale on a single car basis , the @entity61 comes out on top , its hybrid technology delivering 48 city miles on a gallon ( like other hybrids , its fuel efficiency drops slightly on the highway , to 45 )			1
with fuel prices hitting hard , where are motorists more likely to find relief ? on a fleet basis , the best performing manufacturer is @entity8 's @entity7 division , with three models averaging out at just over 27 mpg city / highway			2
but fitting a family any bigger than two or three in the @entity7 is n't possible ; @entity77 might be a more realistic choice , its 27 models average out at almost 24 mpg combined			0
domestically , the winner in average fuel economy is @entity81 , its 88 models average a combined 23.26 mpg combined city / highway , only slightly lower than @entity77 's 23.81 mpg average			1
@entity41 autos : three cheap , fuel - efficient new cars what 's more impressive is that @entity81 's numbers factor in a full line of trucks , not the case with @entity77 ( its only offering in that category being the @entity93 )			1
but as shoppers would be quick to point out , it 's not the fleet that we 're buying			0
it 's the individual car or truck			0
@entity41 autos : cars with 30 + @entity101 for $ 300 or less per month by category , the 2008 @entity102 singles out the leaders , and there it 's more than a little apparent that the traditional @entity18 and @entity108 brands are n't about to give up their leadership position			2
for two - seaters , it 's @entity112 ' smart brand that delivers 33/41 mpg city / highway , followed by @entity116 's @entity115 and its 22/27 mpg rating			2
@entity41 autos : 10 cars with the best gas mileage @entity7 stands alone in the next size category ( mini-subcompact ) , with its two variations ( manual and automatic ) delivering 28/37 combined and 26/34 respectively			2
an interesting side note : the traditional argument that manual transmissions deliver higher fuel economy no longer holds true			2
several carmakers boast higher fuel economy with the automatic transmission than with a manual ( if available )			2
@entity61 's @entity130 takes top honors in the subcompact category , posting 29/35 with an automatic transmission ( 29/36 for the manual )			1
the compact category has the @entity135 at the top of the ratings , with its 40/45 mpg , followed by @entity61 's @entity138 and its 28/37 mpg rating			1
a little bigger vehicle will still take you further , notably if it 's the industry leading @entity61			0
in second place is the @entity144 and its 26/31 mpg rating			0
the federal government 's " large car " category has the @entity149 at the top with 21/31 mpg ( manual ) and 22/31 mpg ( automatic )			1
@entity77 once again takes top honors in the small station wagon category , the @entity153 coming in at 27/34 ( automatic ) and 28/34 ( manual )			0
@entity155 's @entity154 came out on top in the midsize station wagon category with 20/28 mpg for the automatic and 20/29 with manual transmission			0
where pickups are concerned , the differences between manufacturers are only slight , with @entity165 's ranger two - wheel - drive ranger pickup tying with its @entity116 cousin , the @entity167 at 21/26 mpg city / highway , followed by @entity61 's @entity170 two - wheel - drive version delivering slightly less -- 19/25 mpg			1
in the standard pickup truck category , 15/20 mpg city / highway seems to be the standard , only the @entity175 and @entity177 's @entity176 ( both two - wheel - drive ) eking out a slightly higher 16 mpg city			1
@entity180 apparently owns the cargo van category when it comes to fuel economy , its @entity185 and @entity186 version delivering 15/20 mpg			1
and the @entity187 has similar bragging rights in the minivan category , with 21/27 mpg ( automatic ) and 22/28 mpg ( manual )			0
the sport utility vehicle category has @entity165 taking top honors , not only with the @entity192 at 34/30 but its virtually identical hybrid cousins the @entity195 and @entity194			1
the @entity196 and @entity197 , both with manual transmission and two - wheel - drive , are rated at 23/28 mpg city / highway			0
so who 's the worst when it comes to earning the gas guzzler label ? look to the so - called " exotics			0
" the average @entity207 , for example , will average just over 11 mpg ( combined city and highway ) , only slightly outdoing the two - seater @entity210 's 10 mpg			1
but people who buy those cars are n't nearly as likely to wince as the gas pump numbers go flying by			0
the lesson : just about any way the numbers are sliced and diced , there are options for car buyers looking for fuel relief			0
and the differences may be surprising			0
comparisons based on data available in the @entity225 2008 @entity102 , published by the @entity24 @entity25 , the @entity222 and the @entity24 @entity27			0
number of vehicles for each manufacturer includes variations in transmission , engine and trim , and fuel octane requirements .			0

two fuel - efficient races to win : best car and best all - around automaker
@entity61 is *no.* 1 car -- hybrid technology gives 48 city miles on a gallon
" exotic " cars like @entity207 and @entity210 are worst fuel - economy automakers
compact category has @entity135 , @entity138 at top of ratings
