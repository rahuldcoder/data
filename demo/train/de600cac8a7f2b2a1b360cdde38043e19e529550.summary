it 's been almost two decades since i was separated from my family , my home and my past as a war child			1
last year i was able to travel back to @entity6 to find my parents , reconnect with others who survived the war and place my vote in the referendum that would eventually lead to the division of @entity13 into two independent states			1
on july 9 2011 , the @entity13 was born			1
it 's hard to describe how i felt that day as i stood among tens of thousands of @entity13 men , women and children waving our new flag and screaming " @entity21 ! @entity22 ! " through two civil wars that lasted a total of 39 years , this is what we had hoped , prayed and fought for ; it was hard to believe it was happening in my lifetime			1
yes , each one of us has fears , hopes and dreams about how we are transforming into a nation			2
as a citizen , i do n't mind us having to crawl and take small steps in our progress			0
development is not a race and for it to be sustainable it should be holistic			0
we 're starting from scratch and have a lot of ground to cover			0
i was born into @entity13 's civil war and before i could read or write i was using an @entity44 in the conflict between the @entity47 north and @entity49 / @entity48 south over the land and natural resources			1
i protected myself , survived and ended up in the western world where i had to play catch - up with youth who had much calmer childhoods			0
it was never easy , but i always tried my best and kept complaints out of my heart by holding tightly onto the hope that one day , i would read and write			0
this is a dream for many boys and girls who were born on the battlefields of @entity13 simply because during the civil war there were no schools at all			1
now there are a few in @entity70 and a significant need for more all across the country			0
my main concern for the newest nation in the world is not tribalism or corruption -- though they both exist , it 's the fact that we are still at war with the @entity81 ( @entity81 ) of @entity13 , the governing official party of @entity13 , and this needs to be permanently addressed before moving onto smaller issues			1
five months ago i went to @entity13 to vote and raise the flag on the soil of my new country			1
while we were beginning the countdown to independence the @entity81 , which is headed by @entity13 president @entity89 , raided @entity90 and forced innocent people from their land			2
why ? well , the region produces 70 % of our oil			0
as i write this article there are still many innocent people suffering and dying all across the country			0
if the @entity99 does not increase its pressure on president @entity89 , a return to war and bloodshed over @entity106 's land and natural resources is very likely			1
that being said , i am very optimistic about the future of my country			2
we all feel a strong sense of ownership when we think of @entity114 because everybody sacrificed and suffered to get us to where we are now			0
we need to feel the same sense of ownership towards finding solutions to our problems ; homemade solutions need to be found to fix what we messed up			1
to do this we need to work together with world powers while ensuring that the resulting plans hold the interests of @entity13 at heart			2
the @entity13 is still a baby ; our leaders should be willing to take small steps towards developments and not move too fast			2
the solutions we put into place need to be in line with our long - term interests while offering short - term relief , which is not always that easy to do			0
but if the government of @entity13 can provide security and education , the rest will begin to fall into place and matters such as finding alternative energy sources for @entity70 can be taken care of			2
as the youngest nation in the world we have the advantage of learning from the experiences of others , starting with sustainable solutions from the beginning -- electricity made by generators can only take us so far ! with my fellow brothers i walked to @entity155 barefoot without adequate food or water in the rain and burning sun , eating unripe mangoes and dodging the corpses of those who perished along the way			1
it took 18 years for me to find my way home again and through it , i was blessed to not experience any forms of physical war			1
but it became clear to me that human drama is unavoidable			0
all around the world there is corruption , tribalism and division , as many find it easier to pick on those that are different , which is why we need to hold tightly to the good in this world			0
we are all trying to make it the best way we know how , so when we look at each other as individuals and nations we should do so with compassion .			0

18 years ago , @entity190 walked barefoot to @entity155 from @entity13 to escape its civil war
the former " lost boy " is optimistic about the future of @entity13
" homemade solutions need to be found to fix what we messed up , " he says
he fears a return to war with @entity13 's northern *neighbor*
