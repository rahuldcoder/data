@entity0 -- the @entity4 administration could be in violation of the @entity6 if it fails to get congressional authorization by sunday for @entity9 participation in the @entity11 military mission , house speaker @entity2 said tuesday			1
in a letter to president @entity4 that his aides made public , @entity2 , @entity12 , complained that the administration has failed to address questions about the mission that were in a @entity19 resolution passed june 3			1
that resolution set a two - week deadline for a response			2
@entity2 's letter reiterated the friday deadline and took the additional step of warning that a failure to respond could violate the @entity6			1
according to @entity2 , a 90 - day deadline for congressional authorization of the @entity11 mission expires sunday			1
" it would appear that , in five days , the administration will be in violation of the @entity6 unless it asks for and receives authorization from @entity32 or withdraws all @entity9 troops and resources from the mission , " @entity2 's letter said			2
the @entity19 has previously said it was complying with the @entity6 through frequent briefings on the @entity11 mission			1
@entity2 's letter contested that assertion			0
" since the mission began , the administration has provided tactical operational briefings to the @entity41 , but the @entity19 has systematically avoided requesting a formal authorization for its action , " @entity2 's letter said			2
" it has simultaneously sought , however , to portray that its actions are consistent with the @entity6			0
the combination of these actions has left many members of @entity32 , as well as the @entity9 people , frustrated by the lack of clarity over the administration 's strategic policies , by a refusal to acknowledge and respect the role of the @entity32 , and by a refusal to comply with the basic tenets of the @entity6			0
" such political wrangling over war powers is common in @entity0 , with presidents frequently seeking to expand their freedom to commit @entity9 forces and @entity32 battling to exert influence on the process			0
@entity2 's letter said that , in this case , " the ongoing , deeply divisive debate originated with a lack of genuine consultation prior to commencement of operations and has been further exacerbated by the lack of visibility and leadership from you and your administration			0
" with his letter , @entity2 raised the stakes on an issue that could prove politically embarrassing to @entity4 , with increasing numbers of @entity82 and @entity83 opposing the @entity11 mission			1
@entity82 sen. @entity85 of @entity86 , who supports the @entity11 mission , said tuesday that he expected the @entity19 to provide @entity32 with details on the @entity11 mission this week			1
" my understanding is the @entity19 will be sending over a report and lots of information about what we 've done , " @entity85 said , adding that the @entity88 could then vote on a resolution backing the mission that would be intended to satisfy questions over the @entity6 requirement			1
to @entity85 , the delay in a @entity19 response made the issue more challenging than necessary			2
" i can assure you that it 's gon na be much more difficult , with a lot more amendments and a lot more debates , than if we would have done this a couple months ago , " @entity85 said			0
@entity111 spokesman @entity110 said late tuesday that the information would probably be delivered to members of @entity32 on wednesday			0
" we are in the final stages of preparing extensive information for the @entity19 and @entity88 that will address a whole host of issues about our ongoing efforts in @entity11 , including those raised in the @entity19 resolution as well as our legal analysis with regard to the @entity6 , " he said			1
since march 1 , administration witnesses have testified at more than 10 hearings that included a " substantial discussion of @entity11 " and participated in more than 30 member or staff briefings on the matter , he said			0
in announcing the mission in march , @entity4 said @entity9 forces would take the early lead in establishing a no - fly zone over the country in order to enforce a @entity137 resolution calling for the protection of @entity11 civilians from forces loyal to leader @entity141			2
the @entity9 forces eventually assumed a supporting role as @entity143 took over the mission			0
congressional opponents of the mission say that its objective of civilian protection fails to match the stated @entity9 goal of @entity141 's resignation or ouster and that the @entity11 situation could become a stalemate			2
the @entity19 says incremental progress is occurring through increasing diplomatic , political and military pressure on @entity141 to step down			0
in a coincidence of scheduling , @entity4 and @entity2 are set to play golf together for the first time saturday , a day after @entity2 's deadline for information from the administration and the day before he says it could be in violation of the @entity6			1
@entity1 's @entity166 contributed to this report .			0
