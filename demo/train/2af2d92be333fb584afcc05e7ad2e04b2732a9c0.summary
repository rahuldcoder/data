@entity0 an ancient @entity3 system of summoning good luck , feng shui -- literally wind and water -- is part of the fabric of @entity0 life			1
shopping malls , office towers and homes draw on its principles in their design in an attempt to create prosperity			1
and individuals often consult feng shui masters to decide on the best date to get married , give birth or move house			0
the run - up up to the @entity25 is the busiest time of year for @entity27 , a feng shui practitioner who has published 15 books on the subject			1
his clients , which include some of @entity0 's biggest companies , all want their " annual audit " to maximize their good fortune in the year to come			1
he took time out to take @entity1 on a tour of the city 's feng shui hot spots , where the cosmic energy will help you do the @entity41 proud			1
it 's hard to believe that @entity43 , the crowded , traffic - clogged heart of @entity0 shopping district @entity45 , enjoys some of the city 's best feng shui			1
but imagine the towering skyscrapers are mountains and the endless procession of cars , taxis and delivery trucks a meandering river and it all begins to make sense , says @entity27			1
@entity45 benefits from what @entity27 calls a " feng shui meridian " between four peaks and it 's built atop two " dragon pulses " that flow into @entity0 in the form of mountain ranges			1
it 's this that attracts the hordes of free - spending shoppers that make the place a goldmine for retailers and landlords			2
if you can put up with the crowds and the noise , @entity45 is also lucky place to call home , says @entity27 , who lives here			1
how to get there : @entity79 two bronze lions stand guard at the entrance to the @entity83 in downtown @entity0 , protecting the money within			2
some locals like to stroke their paws and noses in a hope their good feng shui fortune will rub off			0
the bank , says @entity27 , harnesses energy from the five mountains nearby -- benefiting it and the surrounding buildings			2
but it 's a different tale a short walk away at the @entity98 or @entity98 -- @entity100 's tallest building			0
built on reclaimed land that interrupts the flow of water in the harbor , the building 's " unkind energy " leads to grievances -- not least , he says , for the family that built it			0
the three @entity112 brothers behind property developer @entity113 became embroiled in a years - long family feud and the eldest has been indicted on misconduct charges in a corruption case that gripped the city			0
how to get there : @entity120 the striking @entity0 government headquarters , known as @entity122 , were the focus of massive pro-democracy protests that rocked the city late last year			1
this was no coincidence according to @entity27			2
the government has been beset by difficulties since it moved to the new building in 2011			0
like the @entity98 , the building is sited on reclaimed land and radiates " bad energy " he says			0
" reclamation is changing @entity0 's feng shui , " he says			1
" we should stop now or things may get worse			0
" how to get there : @entity141 just south of @entity0 's border with @entity146 , a small path in the village of @entity144 leads to this ancestral hall			1
it was built in 1751 for the now rich and prosperous @entity150 clan to worship their ancestors , but the plot of land originally belonged to the rival @entity149 , says @entity27			2
in order to claim the " feng shui hot spot " for themselves , the @entity150 clan chased out the @entity161 and built their hall			0
but to appease the ancestors of their rivals , they made offerings to the @entity168 's forefathers as well as their own			0
to this day , the @entity161 are unhappy about the " kidnapping " of their ancestors and blame the @entity150 clan for their family 's bad fortune			0
this spring they 'll perform a ritual to invite their ancestors back to their own hall , says @entity27			2
how to get there : @entity175 , 15 minute walk @entity177 in @entity178 is as good a place as any to ring in @entity181 , but it has n't always been an auspicious spot			0
the original temple was built by villagers 300 years ago in an desperate attempt to halt the spread of a plague outbreak			0
legend has it that the epidemic began to subside the day the temple was completed , says @entity27			2
on the third day of the @entity25 , which this year falls on saturday , it now attracts crowds of worshipers who light incense and wish for good health			0
it 's also where , each year , a government official draws a fortune stick in a divination ritual thought to foretell @entity0 's luck in the coming year			1
the message is written in classical @entity3 and interpreted by a feng shui master			0
how to get there : @entity120 @entity204 a 15 - minute boat ride from the stilted fishing village of @entity207 lies a tiny village with a shady past			0
in the 1950s and 60s , many of the village 's women left to work as prostitutes in @entity214 , @entity27 says			1
alarmed , village elders consulted a local feng shui master , who identified an " obscene rock " on the headland near the village that resembled a naked man " showing off his private parts , " he tells me			0
using explosives , they blasted off the protruding part and within a few years village life was back to normal			2
how to get there : bus to @entity207 from @entity230 the @entity231 is an unbeatable vantage point for taking in @entity0 's celebrated skyline and also happens to offer up the city 's most auspicious feng shui			1
surrounded by water on four sides and with a direct line of sight to @entity242 in @entity243 , the houses that cling to the mountainside are home to @entity0 's rich and powerful			1
the winding @entity245 that links @entity247 and @entity248 gaps , taps the best flow of " cosmic energy , " says @entity27			2
inhabitants include a @entity253 ambassador , the city 's financial secretary and a handful of tycoons , he adds			1
how to get there : take @entity259 from @entity260			0

@entity262 is an *important* part of @entity0 life
shopping malls , office towers and homes draw on its principles
