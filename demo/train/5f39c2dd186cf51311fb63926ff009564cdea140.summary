it 's been less than two months since the world first learned about it , and now , it 's official			2
wednesday sees the publication of " @entity5 " # 1 , which tells how the original @entity5 we all know ( perhaps best of all , @entity10 's character in the movie ) is replaced by a new @entity5 with two x chromosomes			1
@entity13 spoke with writer @entity14 , who talks about how having a woman carry the hammer of @entity5 was the plan all along			1
@entity13 : why did you decide to try this story arc ? @entity14 : i 've been working for a couple of years now -- 25 issues at this point -- i 've always known i was working towards making him unworthy			1
worthiness was a big theme in those first 25 issues			2
the idea that he 'd wake up every morning and look at that hammer , and not know if he could pick it up , then that means one day , he would n't pick it up			2
so perhaps someone else could pick it up -- the only one i ever considered for that role is the one we have , the woman behind that mask			1
in issue 2 , we get to see her in action for the first time , and how similar or different she is to the first guy to wield the hammer			2
@entity13 : is this change long term ? @entity14 : yes			1
it 's not four or five issues and we 're done			2
a lot of people have speculated that with " @entity53 : @entity58 " next year , which has @entity5 in a prominent role , they guessed that we would change the character back in time for the movie , that 's not the plan			1
i wanted to make sure that we were committed to this being a long - term story			1
you wo n't see everything put back the way it was anytime soon			2
she is the @entity5 of the @entity66 for the foreseeable future			1
we have these @entity66 creative summits a few times a year , and a bunch of writers get together and talk about what our stories will be months and years down the line			2
at this last one , we talked about stories to the end of 2015 and beyond			0
when we would talk about @entity5 , we would be talking about her			1
she 's gon na be on adventures all throughout the @entity66			0
@entity13 : did you expect this much attention ? @entity14 : i never really think or worry about that kind of stuff			1
i 've never had something announced on " @entity84 " before			0
that helps it go more mainstream than a lot of the stuff i 've done			0
i never worry about that when i 'm sitting down to write the story			0
i just work the best i can to tell the story i want to tell			0
@entity13 : how much do you pay attention to fan feedback ? @entity14 : i take it all with a grain of salt , whether it 's high praise or people who are just venting rage			1
i never let any of that kind of stuff change the story i want to tell			0
it 's been exciting to see people anxious to pick up the book			0
that 's been great , but on the flip side it 's been disappointing to see people respond negatively to the fact that it 's a female picking up the hammer now			0
that part 's been disappointing , but that to me has been washed out by the people who are excited to see a new @entity5 story			1
@entity13 : what did you decide to go for with the design of the new thor ? @entity14 : we wanted her to look like @entity5 , the @entity121 god of thunder , someone who carried a hammer around for a living			1
@entity124 is the artist on the new book , and he 's the one who has been drawing that new costume for the most part			0
i think it looks amazing in his hands			0
@entity13 : finally , one of the biggest questions we 've heard is : why is she called @entity5 ? @entity14 : it 's not a situation where she picks up the hammer and says " hey , i 'm @entity5 now , everybody call me @entity5			1
" that 's very much a story point that we address a couple of issues down the line			0
the previous guy is still around , he 's @entity5			1
you can imagine when the two of them meet , face to face , there will be a lot of questions			0
he wants to know who this lady is running around with his hammer now			0
that will all be answered in the pages of the book			0
