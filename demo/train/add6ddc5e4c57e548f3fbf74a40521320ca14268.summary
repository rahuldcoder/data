-- @entity2 's @entity1 gave quite a monologue monday , dressing down competing makers of smartphones , tablets and software			1
the brunt of that was aimed at @entity10 , which makes the @entity12 software that powers smartphones from a range of manufacturers including @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18			1
first , @entity1 expressed skepticism about how @entity10 reports its number of @entity12 users			1
this is an issue @entity1 has raised in prior speeches , yet he freely addressed the point of comparison , saying @entity2 has activated 75,000 more @entity27 devices over the last 30 days compared to @entity10 's last reported @entity12 activation number			1
@entity1 , who made his comments in an unusual appearance on @entity2 's quarterly earnings call with investors , then took issue with the geeky argument of open versus closed , which refers to how transparent a system 's source code is to developers			1
" @entity10 loves to characterize @entity12 as open , and @entity27 and @entity38 as closed , " @entity1 said			1
" we find this a bit disingenuous and clouding the differences between our two approaches			0
" he called @entity12 " fragmented			2
" he highlighted how @entity12 handset makers install layers on top of @entity10 's software , which can introduce unexpected problems			1
and @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity51 say they intend to create their own digital stores to sell applications to @entity12 users , despite @entity10 's own marketplace			1
" this is going to be a mess for both users and developers , " @entity1 said			0
" we believe integrated will trump fragmented every time			0
" later , @entity1 criticized @entity10 for not having a version of @entity12 that plays nicely with tablets			1
the animated executive then turned his attention to tablet - device makers , which are ramping up production in advance of the holiday season			0
" almost all of them use 7 - inch screens , as opposed to the @entity71 's 10 - inch screen , " @entity1 said			2
" this size is n't sufficient to create great tablet apps			0
" @entity1 joked that people would need to sandpaper their fingers in order to use these gadgets comfortably			0
while a smaller tablet is obviously more portable , he says consumers wo n't want something that replaces a smartphone			0
" every tablet user is also a smartphone user , " he proclaimed			0
his comments will perhaps put an end to speculation that @entity2 will make a 7 - inch @entity71			0
" we think the 10 - inch screen size is the minimum screen size required to make great tablet apps , " he added			0
additionally , @entity1 said tablet makers will have a hard time matching @entity2 's prices			1
the most inexpensive @entity71 sells for $ 499			0
competitors ' tablets will be " dead on arrival , " @entity1 said			2
he added : " sounds like lots of fun ahead			0
" @entity1 began his comments monday by relishing in @entity2 's successes with the @entity38 , pointing to the 14.1 million smartphones the company sold during the recent three - month fiscal period			1
that tops @entity105 's 12.1 million units sold , as @entity1 was quick to note			1
" we have now passed @entity105 , and i do n't see them catching up to us in the foreseeable future , " @entity1 said			2
" i think it 's going to be a challenge for them to create a competitive platform and to convince developers to create apps for yet a third software platform , after @entity27 and @entity12			2
" @entity105 , the @entity116 smartphone manufacturer , is popular with corporate it departments for its tight security mechanisms and reliable keyboards for tapping out long emails			2
despite the slow quarter for @entity105 , the @entity122 maker still has the highest market share of smartphone users , according to independent data			2
the company is preparing to enter the tablet market with its @entity129 , an area dominated by @entity2 's @entity71			1
" @entity105 has a high mountain to climb , " @entity1 concluded			2
on @entity132 , which makes the flash platform that powers most of the @entity136 's video , @entity1 dodged questions			1
he finally addressed the lack of @entity140 support on the @entity71 , @entity38 and @entity141 , saying : " @entity140 has n't presented any problem at all			0
" on @entity143 , which sells the most cell phones worldwide , @entity1 said : " @entity143 is the biggest , and we admire them for being able to ship the number of handsets that they do			1
but we do n't aspire to be like them			0
" " @entity143 makes $ 50 handsets , and we do n't know how to make a great smartphone for $ 50 , " @entity1 said			1
" we 're not smart enough to figure that one out yet			0
" for the famed business leader to take part in the company 's earnings call is strange enough , as he acknowledged after being introduced in the meeting monday			1
( @entity2 broke a number of its sales records this quarter			0
) but his comments were even more unexpected			0
oftentimes , his discussions would come back to @entity10 , as they did again after a question about @entity143			2
" @entity12 is our biggest competitor , " @entity1 said			1
" they outshipped us in the june quarter when we were transitioning to the @entity38			0
" " eventually it will turn into a zero - sum game or a lot closer to that , " @entity1 said of the smartphone market			2
" right now , @entity38 and @entity12 are winning that battle			0

@entity2 's @entity1 participated in the company 's earnings call , which is unusual
@entity1 had *choice* words for competitors including @entity10 , @entity105 , @entity143 and @entity132
