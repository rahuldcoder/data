-- @entity1 still has some tricks up her sleeve			2
the " @entity5 " author is returning to the world of wizards that made her famous , but it 's not going to be with a new book -- and it 's not going to feature @entity12			0
@entity1 revealed as secret author of crime novel instead , @entity1 is going to make her screenwriting debut with a movie centered around one of @entity5 's textbooks , " @entity19 , " and the sojourns of its author , @entity21			1
according to @entity1 , she became intrigued with the idea after a proposal from studio @entity25 the author says in a statement that the studio ( which shares a parent company with @entity0 ) approached her " with the suggestion of turning ' @entity19 ' into a film , " which she thought could be interesting , but was n't excited to see handled by another writer			1
after inspiration struck for what she could do with the story , she says she ended up pitching her own plot			0
" having lived for so long in my fictional universe , i feel very protective of it and i already knew a lot about @entity21 , " @entity1 says			0
" as hard - core ' @entity5 ' fans will know , i liked him so much that i even married his grandson , @entity41 , to one of my favorite characters from the ' @entity5 ' series , @entity45			0
" not just @entity1 : best - selling female authors with male monikers but while " @entity19 " pulls inspiration from the " @entity5 " universe , @entity1 is very clear that this movie is n't a prequel or a sequel of that franchise , which ended with 2011 's " @entity5 and the @entity54 : part 2			1
" instead , with the project being " set in the worldwide community of witches and wizards where i was so happy for 17 years , " @entity1 says it should be considered " an extension of the wizarding world			0
the laws and customs of the hidden magical society will be familiar to anyone who has read the ' @entity5 ' books or seen the films , but @entity21 's story will start in @entity70 , 70 years before @entity5 's gets under way			2
" @entity1 penning ' @entity5 ' encyclopedia according to @entity25 , " @entity19 " will be the first in a planned series of films			1
in addition to the new franchise , @entity25 has also entered into an " expanded creative partnership " with @entity1 , which will cover projects like video games , digital initiatives and tourist attractions			2
for @entity25 , this has to be a day of celebration			0
all told , the eight films produced based on @entity1 's best - selling books have earned more than $ 7.7 billion worldwide , which by 2011 helped it edge out " @entity89 " as the top - grossing film series ever .			1
