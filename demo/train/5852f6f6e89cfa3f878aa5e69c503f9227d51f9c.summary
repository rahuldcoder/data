in her race to defeat @entity3 @entity2 , @entity0 has barnstormed @entity4 , talking up her support for raising the minimum wage and criticizing the @entity8 's so - called war on women			1
but the restaurant owned by @entity0 ' family does n't always practice what she preaches , and @entity4 @entity8 have been happy to point that out			1
on the campaign trail , @entity0 said recently , " i 'm fighting for all @entity15 , all working @entity16 across this nation			0
i do n't believe $ 7.25 an hour raises a family of four above the poverty level			0
" but documents and interviews with employees reveal that , like many restaurants , her family 's burger joint pays some tipped staffers minimum wage			1
we caught up with @entity0 in @entity4 and asked how she can advocate for raising the minimum wage , when that 's all her family 's restaurant pays some workers			1
" listen , my family is not in this race			0
i 'm on the ballot			0
and as much as @entity2 wants to attack my family , he has from the beginning , i 'm going to stay focused on the issues , " she told @entity38			2
" and for me , it 's about making sure that hard working @entity15 have a bright future			0
and that future includes having not just a minimum wage , but a living wage			1
" of course , servers can often make more than minimum wage after tips			1
and while @entity0 does n't own the restaurant , she did do legal work for the business , signing incorporation documents and representing it in a lawsuit			2
but minimum wage is n't the only issue dogging @entity0 ' family business			1
@entity60 -- say it out loud to get the joke -- has menu items like " @entity64 , sure to be voted biggest rack " named after @entity0 ' mom and " @entity68 's @entity67 , " a burger named after her sister			0
they also sell souvenirs like an apron with " @entity73 " emblazoned across it			0
the restaurant 's approach has raised eyebrows , especially since @entity0 ' camp accused the @entity8 of sexism			2
" i am the @entity4 woman who my @entity8 colleagues in this state so gentlemanly refer to as an empty dress , " @entity0 said			0
when we tried to ask @entity0 about her family 's use of double entendre , she refused to answer , letting her security detail lead her away from reporters .			2

@entity0 is campaigning on raising the minimum wage
the restaurant owned by her family pays tipped staffers minimum wage
@entity0 to @entity38 : " my family is not in this race "
