-- police began drilling friday outside a suburban @entity3 home in the search for @entity5 , the labor strongman whose disappearance is one of the most notorious and mysterious in @entity9 history			1
a tipster told police that a body was buried at the spot in @entity13 , @entity14 , about the time the @entity16 boss disappeared in 1975			1
the tipster did not claim it was @entity5 's body , authorities said			1
police chief @entity20 said thursday that while the tipster 's information seems credible , he 's not convinced the body is @entity5 's because of the timeline			1
he spoke with the tipster august 22 and believes the person did see a burial			0
2010 : digging into the @entity5 legend ? the tipster did not come forward sooner out of fear , @entity20 said			1
@entity31 , author of " the @entity32 , " said the tipster , a former gambler , contacted him march 30			0
the tipster used to do business with a man who had ties to @entity39 , an organized crime figure who was supposed to meet @entity5 the day he disappeared , @entity31 said			1
" i am very skeptical , " @entity31 said of the planned dig. if @entity5 's burial had taken place at the spot , it would have been in full view of the neighborhood , the author argued			1
and if @entity5 's body was disposed of , it would have been done in a way that no evidence would be left years later , he said			1
it should n't take long to get a sample , which will be sent to @entity55 for analysis , @entity0 affiliate @entity53 reported			0
the reading will determine whether there are human remains at the site but will not identify them , @entity20 said			1
" it took us a while to get the proper equipment to do what we 're going to do			0
if this is a person , they 've been down there for 35 years			0
what 's a few more days ? " @entity71 asked			0
results from the soil testing should be available next week , the chief said wednesday			0
" if they are positive , we will then start excavating , " @entity20 said			0
the alleged burial site is under a concrete slab , and the residence is occupied by new homeowners , who 've been " cooperative and excellent to police , " @entity20 said			0
the @entity83 in @entity3 had no comment on the planned search , and a statement from the @entity16 said the @entity5 family had nothing to say at this time			1
" the @entity5 family does not respond every time a tip is received by authorities			1
the @entity83 keeps the family informed , and they will have no comment until there is a reason to comment , " the statement said			0
@entity5 remains among @entity9 's most famous , and in many ways infamous , missing people			1
his presumed death has vexed investigators for four decades			0
one of the most powerful union leaders at a time that unions wielded a great deal of sway over elections -- and were notoriously tied to organized crime -- @entity5 was forced out of the organized labor movement when he was sent to prison in 1967			1
he served time for jury tampering and fraud at a federal penitentiary in @entity109 , @entity110 , until being pardoned by president @entity111 on december 23 , 1971 -- on the condition that he not try to get back into the union movement before 1980			2
two weeks before @entity5 's disappearance in 1975 , federal investigators discovered that hundreds of millions of dollars had been stolen from the @entity16 ' largest pension fund , @entity114 points out in its list of the top 10 most famous disappearances			1
@entity5 , 62 , was last seen july 30 , 1975 , at @entity121 restaurant in suburban @entity3			1
he was there ostensibly to meet with reputed @entity123 street enforcer @entity39 and @entity124 , chief of a @entity16 local in @entity126 , who was later convicted in a murder case			2
both men have since died			0
@entity5 believed @entity39 had set up the meeting to help settle a feud between @entity5 and @entity124 , but @entity5 was the only one who showed up for the meeting , according to the @entity83			2
@entity39 and @entity124 later told the @entity83 that no meeting had been scheduled			0
the @entity83 said at the time that the disappearance could have been linked to @entity5 's efforts to regain power in the @entity16 and to the mob 's influence over the union 's pension funds			1
police and the @entity83 have searched for @entity5 intermittently ever since			2
in september 2001 , the @entity83 found dna that linked @entity5 to a car that agents suspected was used in his disappearance			2
in 2004 , authorities removed floorboards from a @entity3 home to look for traces of blood , as former @entity16 official @entity151 claimed in a biography that he had shot @entity5			1
investigators ruled that blood found in the house was not @entity5 's			1
the @entity83 has a sample of his dna from a hair brush			0
two years later , the @entity83 razed a horse barn in @entity14 after what it called " a fairly credible lead			0
" but the disappearance remains unsolved			2
urban lore long suggested that @entity5 was buried around the end zone at the former @entity165 in @entity126			2
as @entity167 puts it , the mystery surrounding @entity5 is not simply a " whodunnit			2
" " the likely suspects are all known , and their motives are well documented			0
the question is : where ? what exactly did they do to @entity5 , and where did they dispose of his body ? " but over the years , numerous theories have been floated			2
in 1987 , @entity180 -- a former @entity5 strong - arm -- and a @entity183 reporter published " @entity184 , " which @entity185 described as " the hair - raising inside story of @entity5			0
" " rather than being kidnapped by rival union forces as law enforcement authorities have long speculated , @entity180 says @entity5 was abducted by two federal agents , " @entity185 reported			2
" he thinks they drove @entity5 to a nearby airport , took off in a small plane , and pushed him out over one of the @entity196			0
@entity180 says he did not tell federal investigators this bizarre , and unverifiable , story because they would not grant him immunity			0
" @entity5 's son , @entity200 , is the current president of the @entity16			1
