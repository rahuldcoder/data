-- @entity4 's @entity3 policy , if there ever really was one , is in tatters			1
it has unraveled at breakneck speed , as @entity8 moved against @entity9 , effectively annexed part of its territory , and put its smaller neighbor on the brink of war			2
moving from disbelief to dismay to horror , @entity4 lost whatever hopes and illusions they may have harbored that @entity8 was a predictable and cooperative partner			2
instead , images are being invoked of the @entity24 intervention in @entity25 in 1968 and in @entity26 in 1956 , and a new @entity27 seems fully possible now			0
however far - fetched they may seem , these comparisons reflect a frantic search among @entity31 politicians and experts for the underlying causes , rationales and consequences of @entity8 's actions in @entity9			1
and it slowly dawns on @entity4 that it is witness to a sea change in @entity8 foreign policy that shakes the very foundations of the @entity42 order that emerged after the fall of the @entity44			1
new interventionist strategy @entity8 's actions in @entity9 , while still in full swing , signal nothing less than the maturing of a new and interventionist strategy			1
resembling the original @entity51 doctrine , the @entity49 seems fully resolved now to interfere with any of its post-soviet neighbors , should they chose a political model at home or affiliations abroad that differ from what @entity57 proposes : autocracy from within , and @entity61 integration from without			1
renegades in turn , such as @entity9 after the ouster of @entity65 , that venture towards democracy and @entity69 integration , will face @entity8 retaliation designed to threaten their very existence			2
this strategy has been in the making for a decade			1
once president @entity75 had established his full authoritarian rule , tamed the oligarchs and controlled the economy , and basked in oil and gas revenues , the @entity49 started to move on its neighbors			0
most of these had long remained in a twilight -- some shaky democracies , others semi-dictatorships , all oscillating between @entity87 -- until @entity8 attended to them			2
it propped up odious dictators from @entity90 to @entity91 with financial and political backing			0
it punished defectors from @entity95 to @entity9 with gas cut - offs , trade embargoes , and propaganda wars			0
it " passportized " citizens of @entity101 and found their rights violated , only to send its military to the rescue			0
in short , @entity8 has long tested and refined an arsenal of coercion that can be applied to any of its smaller neighbors politically and economically , socially and culturally , legally and if need be , militarily			1
yet the @entity49 discovered that , besides direct measures against its neighbors , action was needed on additional stages			0
for years now , @entity8 has hollowed out international organizations , such as the @entity115 or the @entity116 , by blocking their budgets , manipulating parliamentary assemblies , and dispatching rival monitors			2
foreign donors , from development aid agencies to private foundations , were squeezed out from @entity8 , @entity90 and elsewhere to weaken civil society and independent media			1
@entity8 business massively expanded its reach into the @entity69 , wooed individual countries with lucrative deals from pipelines in @entity130 to nuclear energy in @entity26 to @entity133 military supplies , and infiltrated @entity69 capitals with a myriad of lobbyists			2
it should hardly surprising , then , that @entity42 responses to @entity8 's increasingly aggressive behavior have been muffled at best			1
what may long have been a cocktail of stand - alone and ad - hoc actions to increase @entity8 influence over its neighbors , and to curtail that of @entity4 , has now become a fully - fledged doctrine with @entity75 's return to the presidency in 2012			1
since then , the @entity49 has both formalized its ambitions and backed them up ideologically			0
on a formal level , it launched the @entity149 , an integration project to return former @entity24 republics to @entity8 hegemony and to prevent them from moving closer to the @entity69			0
on an ideological level , @entity57 dressed its policy as a civilizational struggle of its own superior model of a strong state and controlled society with the weak and degenerate liberal democracies of @entity4			1
in so doing , @entity8 has formulated the political goal and justification needed for employing its many pressure tools systematically and strategically			0
@entity49 emboldened in this light , the current @entity8 intervention in @entity9 is neither the impulsive overreaction of the @entity49 to the loss of an ally , nor result of @entity75 's deficient touch with reality			1
on the contrary , it is the full application of a strategy that has long been in the making			0
the only novelty is that , with the planned incorporation of @entity178 into the @entity8 , this doctrine is now taken to the ultimate end : the redrawing of borders in the post-soviet space			1
in so doing , @entity8 threatens all of its neighbors and challenges the @entity42 order as such			1
nothing so far suggests that @entity8 will limit itself in these aspirations			0
after years of pressuring neighbors without much resistance , the @entity49 feels emboldened in its strategy and has little reason for self - restraint			0
@entity57 's aggressive quest for its " near abroad " has become an ideological mission to fight the @entity31 , one that has left all rational grounds and that ignores all costs and consequences , including those to @entity8 itself			1
opposition to this policy within @entity8 is effectively non-existent , as decisions are taken by a small circle of hardliners , parliament serves to rubber - stamp them , and civil society and independent media have been silenced			1
ordinary @entity8 , in turn , overwhelmingly support @entity75 's actions and assertiveness , at over two - thirds according to recent polls			2
in this situation , brakes on @entity8 interventionism can only be imposed from outside			0
@entity9 have given a powerful example of resistance , through the courage of hundreds of thousands of protesters and the remarkable moderation of their new government in the face of @entity8 provocations			0
yet @entity9 , and no less other neighbors such as @entity101 and @entity95 that have equally chosen a path of democracy and @entity42 integration , will not be able to resist mounting @entity8 aggressiveness			1
only @entity4 , in concert with the @entity231 , can put a check on the @entity75 doctrine before it drags the @entity3 half of the continent into the abyss			0
@entity42 response @entity4 's first immediate response , as is becoming clear even to its most reluctant leaders , must be a range of sanctions against @entity8			1
the @entity69 has rightly tried for negotiations first but has to acknowledge now that the @entity49 flatly refuses any talks and compromise			0
@entity4 must now roll out travel bans and asset freezes against those in the @entity8 leadership who are directly responsible for this escalation , followed by a swift extension to include the 300 or so influentials , and their families , who control much of the country 's politics and business today			2
in a next step , and depending on @entity8 's response , @entity4 should impose a range of economic sanctions , halt arms and technology exports to @entity8 , stop sales of @entity8 - held real estate in the @entity69 , pause preparations of strategic infrastructure projects such as @entity8 pipelines to @entity4 , and subject key @entity8 business operations to the full scrutiny and regulatory power of the @entity69			1
in parallel , @entity4 must sign the association and free trade agreements with @entity9 , @entity95 , and @entity101 within weeks			0
a snap summit of @entity69 leaders could be held in @entity277 that , ideally , would finally state the long - overdue @entity69 membership perspective for @entity3 neighbors , and substantiate this prospect with a comprehensive assistance package to see would - be members through the political , economic and social reforms necessary for @entity42 integration			2
politically and materially , this would send a strong signal of commitment to @entity4 's @entity288 , and one that @entity8 will find hard to match			2
other , more medium and long - term steps would have to follow			0
@entity69 measures will have to be taken to enhance the economic , energy , cyber and hard security of those @entity42 countries -- new @entity69 members as well as neighbors -- that are particularly exposed to @entity8 pressures			1
@entity4 's @entity3 policy will have to be reformulated , based on the acknowledgment that the @entity69 is now in direct competition with @entity8			1
its neighborhood policy will have to be redefined as an enlargement policy , while its @entity8 strategy can no longer be based on the illusion of partnership			1
economic ties with @entity8 , whether its oil and gas imports or business activities in the @entity69 , will have to be reconsidered			0
and @entity4 's multinational institutions , whether @entity115 , @entity116 or @entity311 , must be strengthened and empowered to once again serve as guarantors of collective development and security -- open but not hostage to @entity8			2
this is an enormous agenda , comparable only to the challenge of reuniting @entity4 after the end of the @entity27			0
much as it successfully answered that call , the @entity69 must now muster the political will , foresight and vision to save its eastern neighborhood from falling victim to the @entity75 doctrine			0
