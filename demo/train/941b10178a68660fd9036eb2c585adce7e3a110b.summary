-- can presidential candidates talk to voters like adults ? will voters support a candidate who tells them the truth ? the answer to that question is obvious to anyone who has observed @entity10 politics in recent years			1
one day -- let us hope it comes soon -- voters will demand that their political leaders present them with a more realistic sense of the possibilities and choices they face			1
but for now , voters demand perfect odds and simple solutions , and politicians oblige			1
president @entity20 confessed as much in a recent @entity22 profile , when he revealed he knows that each one of the decisions he makes as president could turn out wrong			1
" nothing comes to my desk that is perfectly solvable , " he said			1
" any given decision you make you 'll wind up with a 30 to 40 percent chance that it is n't going to work			2
" but the @entity10 public , the president suggested , can not handle those odds			1
after you have made your decision , you need to feign total certainty about it			1
despite knowing this , @entity20 did not project that supreme confidence and simplified arguments in wednesday 's debate			1
that was not the president 's only problem , but it was one of the reasons he did n't fare well			2
the frustration showed after the debate , when @entity20 accused @entity42 of blatant lying in a debate that , like both campaigns , has been rife with distortions			1
both candidates twisted the facts			2
@entity42 did it to better effect			2
it 's a tragedy for @entity10 democracy that the tactic works			2
four years ago , @entity20 betrayed no doubts that he would succeed in achieving highly ambitious promises			1
it 's harder to speak in dreamy , inspirational platitudes when you 've been president for four years , when the prose of real life has not caught up with the poetry of the campaign			2
politics : @entity72 's @entity74 makeover the @entity10 political system demands charisma , leadership and boundless optimism , even if they are artificial and hollow			1
some voters tell pollsters that a " strong leader " is one of the most important traits they look for in a candidate			1
and pollsters track the perception obsessively			2
but the prevailing idea of what a strong leader is has become manufactured and artificial			2
candidates have to sound self - assured and authoritative , in a version of leadership that resembles more the utterances of @entity95 in " @entity96 " than the wisdom of the great politician - philosophers who founded the country			1
real charisma allows leaders to change their mind			1
but that 's different from reshaping your supposed ideology to win different audiences			2
intellectual and political honesty are not @entity109 tricks			2
@entity42 's penchant for telling one audience one thing and then taking it back when it does n't suit another audience -- as he just did with his infamous " 47 % " comments by saying he was " completely wrong " -- does not count as mettle			2
in the debate , @entity20 slipped in his efforts to don that leadership mantle			1
he even acknowledged that some of the choices are a matter of odds , that the country is a laboratory and we can only hope the experiments will turn out well			1
on the economy , he said , " look , we 've tried this ; we 've tried both approaches , " comparing the @entity131 approach with the @entity132 years			2
@entity20 took a step toward honesty with the public in suggesting that we can make only an educated guess as to what strategy is likely to work			1
" in some ways , " he said , " we 've got some data on which approach is more likely to create jobs and opportunity for @entity10			2
" evidence , " data			0
" that 's not a modern @entity10 politician 's way of framing a decision			0
@entity10 like it when their leaders ( and their pundits ) are completely sure of what they propose , totally convinced it will work			0
politics : bad debate , good fundraising and jobs report for the president some people believe this is the inevitable way of politics			0
but it does n't have to be			0
in other countries facing great problems such as high unemployment and shrinking economies , these days , " difficult choices " and uncertain outcomes are the centerpiece of political discussions			0
voters are treated as intelligent , responsible adults who have to decide what is the most promising of unpalatable options			1
friday 's unemployment figures seemed to support @entity20 's belief in his economic approach			1
but they do n't erase the uncertainty ahead			0
in the end , we have competing philosophies for facing a world where countless unexpected challenges are sure to emerge			0
an appearance of self - assurance creates a reassuring aura of competence and charisma			1
it makes people feel better			0
people are drawn to those who seem most sure of their ideas			0
but being more certain does not make you more right			0
true charisma and leadership require acknowledging the uncertainties , recognizing the gaps in our knowledge			1
in the view of presidential scholar @entity205 , they require the courage to tell difficult truths , to make unpopular decisions , to work with people who have different beliefs			1
following the current definition , @entity42 proclaims with absolute conviction , as he did during wednesday night 's debate , that " the private market and individual responsibility always works best			0
" and he promises to bring 12 million new jobs while guaranteeing without a hint of doubt that if he is not elected , life will get worse , prices will go up , incomes will come down , and @entity10 will become weaker			0
opinion : will improving economy sink @entity42 ? four years ago , @entity20 made promises that today sound just , well , sad			1
after his 2008 win in the @entity228 caucuses , he told his exhilarated supporters that he would put an end to years of partisan bitterness and pettiness in @entity233			0
he would be the president who would bring " democrats and @entity235 together to get the job done			0
" as a candidate , @entity20 could draw a dreamy vision			1
he would bring red and blue states back together , close down the prison at @entity241 , fight climate change and genocide			0
his election , he said , would " mark the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal			0
" he even vowed to " reboot @entity10 's image in the @entity252 world			0
" instead , he tackled much greater problems than he had expected even when he exaggerated his competence			0
the economy , the world , they all proved more complex than the black and white choices of the election			0
he has made little headway on the environment			0
republicans and @entity234 remain at each other 's throats , and people in @entity268 countries are still not fond of @entity10 or its president			0
in the first debate , candidates again avoided talking about the need to make difficult choices			0
the talk was of tax cuts , not tax ( " revenue " is the euphemism ) increases			0
there are other areas where the choices are difficult and unappealing in foreign and domestic policy			0
voters may feel placidly satisfied when the candidates avoid mentioning the dangers ahead or the hard truths			1
but beneath the wishful thinking , @entity10 know that the world is complicated , the economy is challenging , the choices difficult			0
opinion : @entity42 's demographic bind a candidate who tells voters he is 100 % certain that the choices are clear and his plans will work out is lying , deluded or foolish			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity299 .			0

@entity301 asks , will voters support a presidential candidate who tells the truth ?
@entity301 : the answer is obvious ; voters demand perfect odds and simple solutions
she says @entity20 recently said he has to feign total certainty in his decisions
