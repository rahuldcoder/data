-- thanks to his role as a throne - swiveling talent scout on @entity6 's hit singing competition @entity8 , @entity9 frontman @entity7 is now a stand - alone star — one who seems awfully pleased to see his every move , from the silly beefs with fellow @entity8 coach @entity12 to the flings with @entity15 's secret models , get street - fliered across the media landscape			1
which makes it all too tempting to put him to his own show 's test			0
what if we could listen to a new @entity9 album with our backs turned to the band ? if we did n't know about @entity7 's trysts , his @entity8 image , and the band 's yo - yoing chart history ( including 2010 's disappointing @entity31 and last summer 's smash '' @entity33 '' ) ? would we still hear star potential in these boys from @entity36 ? in the case of " @entity39 , " @entity9 's fourth album in 10 years , the answer is mostly no. but not for lack of effort on their part : inspired , perhaps , by the crossover appeal of '' @entity47 , '' the group has drafted pop kingpins @entity49 , @entity50 , and @entity51 — who regularly deal dope beats to @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , et al			1
— to thoroughly top 40 - ify their game			0
so it 's hardly surprising that on much of the album , which never quite finds a balance between rock grit and dance - pop glitz , @entity9 barely sound like a band at all			1
tracks like '' @entity66 '' and the @entity67 '' have choruses so thickly produced that the only physical instrument you can reliably pick out is @entity7 's larynx			2
not that he comes off as particularly organic either , since his voice is usually processed into a kind of high , disaffected whine — like a male @entity76 or an android castrato — that 's ideal for tracing the contours of a pop hook			1
his lyrics do n't help the songs make up much ground			0
" overexposed " 's self - aware title is just about the strongest wordcraft on the album ; its verses alternate between horndog rhapsodies ( '' i light you up when i get inside , '' @entity7 sings on '' @entity90 '' ) and bratty put - downs of some @entity92 who always disappoints , whether she 's '' drown [ '' ing '' ] me in questions '' ( '' @entity95 '' ) , '' feeling so hollow '' ( '' @entity66 '' ) , or just being '' such a f --- ing snob '' ( '' tickets '' )			2
the exception is first single '' payphone , '' an alchemy of elemental pop - rock building blocks that conjures virile longing in the same corny - graceful way as past @entity103 hits like '' she will be loved			2
'' @entity7 's voice soars , the piano and guitar hit notes of bitter nostalgia , and for once the words ' hurt feels real			1
and whether by @entity115 magic or old - fashioned sweat , the song also sounds remarkably like it was recorded in a studio by musicians who actually came together to play as a band — even if one of them was only dropping by on his way to the soundstage			0
