-- the turmoil that 's roiled @entity3 states from @entity4 to @entity5 is also creating a headache for those entrusted with reviving economies hard hit by rising energy and food prices , growing public debt and the prospect of more expensive borrowing on the international markets			1
since mid-january , credit rating agencies such as @entity16 's have downgraded the sovereign debt of @entity4 , @entity18 and @entity19			1
on tuesday @entity16 's changed the outlook on @entity18 's foreign currency bonds to negative from stable , citing " fiscal and economic downside risks related to ongoing turmoil in the region following events in @entity4 and @entity19			1
" @entity16 's said that @entity18 protesters " could use the regional uprisings as an opportunity to express their discontent about high unemployment and the lack of development for low - income groups			2
" @entity35 's , another major credit rating agency , made a similar move			1
@entity18 officials are not happy with the downgrade , arguing that their public finances are sound -- @entity18 's foreign currency reserves actually rose last year and stand at about $ 12 billion -- and that the economy may grow as much as 6 % in 2011			2
protests there have been largely peaceful and far smaller than in @entity19 and @entity4			1
but after pledging to cut the budget deficit , the government reversed course in january with a package of subsidies and salary increases amounting to some $ 600 million , to compensate for higher prices			0
international bond markets are wary that governments may try to " buy their way " out of trouble , in the words of one analyst			0
it is a potentially toxic cycle , according to regional economists			1
@entity19 and @entity4 have already suffered a loss of tourism revenue in peak season , while record - high grain prices and a surge in the price of crude oil have fueled inflation			1
@entity18 imports 90 per cent of its oil , and faces disruption to its gas supplies after an explosion at a pipeline in @entity19 last week			1
like @entity18 , @entity19 has opted to spend more on subsidies for the poor			1
the recent street protests , now in their third week , have led stores , businesses , the stock market and banks to close -- a further cost			0
until the protests erupted , @entity19 had a positive reputation in the international debt markets -- with attractive interest rates for investors , banks that had avoided high - risk investments , a manageable budget deficit and low overall sovereign debt			2
like @entity18 , it was working to cut its budget deficit			2
but markets abhor uncertainty and the government 's cost of borrowing has risen sharply since the protest movement erupted -- although it has fallen back slightly in recent days			0
earlier this week , the @entity19 @entity98 intervened to support the pound against the dollar , spending precious foreign currency in the process			0
and before the @entity19 stock market closed , some $ 5 billion was wiped off the value of @entity19 stocks in just two days			0
in addition , government wages and pensions in @entity19 have been increased 15 per cent			0
credit strategists say any labor unrest -- especially at the @entity111 where a strike began among service workers wednesday -- would put @entity19 's finances under further pressure			2
shipping has so far been unaffected by the labor action			0
market commentators say that international investors are already avoiding @entity19 treasury auctions -- another is due next week -- meaning local banks are expected to pick up the slack			0
one former @entity18 official told @entity0 that he hoped the country 's vulnerable economic state and its value to the @entity128 as a reliable @entity130 ally would prompt greater financial support from @entity132			1
last year , foreign grants -- mainly from the @entity128 and @entity134 -- totaled more than $ 400 million			0
but there is pressure on the @entity128 federal budget too .			0

credit rating agencies have downgraded the debt of @entity4 , @entity18 and @entity19
a potentially toxic economic cycle could hurt @entity3 economies , analysts say
@entity18 *objects* to downgrade , may look for more @entity128 aid
