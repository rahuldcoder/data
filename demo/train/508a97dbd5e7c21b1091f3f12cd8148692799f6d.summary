much is made of the power of football : the way " the beautiful game " transcends cultural boundaries , knits together communities and makes grown men cry			0
but perhaps football 's greatest -- and most little - known -- achievement was its role in the downfall of communism in @entity12			1
when @entity15 team @entity14 faced off against @entity17 club @entity16 in the 1983 @entity18 , @entity14 's stadium was packed with @entity15 supporters			1
and , while the @entity17 side may have won the match ( a respectable 3 - 2 ) , the truest triumph belonged to @entity14			1
at the time , @entity15 was under martial law : soldiers patrolled the streets , the country 's borders were sealed and activists were imprisoned without charge			1
@entity30 of communist rule was considered crushed			0
but here , in this stadium , something shifted			2
at half - time , the thousands - strong crowd began chanting the name of revolutionary @entity15 trade union @entity37 , which , in trying to activate social change , had been banned under martial law			1
@entity37 's leader , the charismatic @entity40 , stood , revered , among the unified crowd			2
some years later , he would be president			0
" i remember the atmosphere , " @entity42 , says the club 's trainer at the time			2
" he recalls how , at half - time , " in the dressing room we heard all this noise and people were chanting ' @entity37 ! ' ( then ) we saw @entity40 getting up and raising his hand ( to make ) the famous @entity37 symbol			1
" that @entity14 would rally behind this revolution should come as no surprise : the solidarity movement began in the city 's shipyards			1
it was the birthplace of an organization that , according to @entity64 and @entity65 in their book , " @entity14 v @entity16 " , 10 million people belonged to in the early 1980s			1
and , as the match showed , @entity14 was more than @entity37 's birthplace , it was its beating heart			1
rations , curfews , reduced civil liberties and a crumbling economy characterized @entity15 at this time			2
but , as @entity42 puts it , " this match gave us a lot			2
a new ideology and new freedom was born , because people could n't express what they wanted to freely in the streets			0
" the stadium , the match , had become a refuge for protest			1
and it left no doubt that the ruling @entity87 government had failed to quash its opposition			0
state television censored transmission of the game , showing it without sound following the half - time chants , worried the rest of the country would hear the dissension			1
but it was too late			0
@entity40 himself has summed up the power of that day , supposing the authorities had only allowed him to attend the match because " they did n't think @entity37 still had any life in it			2
that match gave us some strength for what would come next "			2
what came next was years of struggle that ended with the 1989 @entity110 , in which @entity40 played a seminal part			0
this paved the way for semi-free parliamentary elections in @entity15 , a @entity37 - led government , and inspired a wave of revolutions that brought down communist regimes in @entity12			0
come 1990 , @entity40 was in office as president			0
not many may know what a football match in @entity14 did for democracy in @entity12 , but @entity14 fans will never forget			1
nor will the team 's current goalkeeper , @entity126 who was born the same year the match took place			0
" still , in 2014 , when you play a game here you can sometimes see a flag in the crowds with the ' @entity37 ' name on it , " he says			0
" our fans remember the times because it happened here , you know ? everything happened here			0
" send in your best shots from @entity15			0

the match between @entity14 and @entity16 *fueled* the downfall of communism
at half time the crowd began chanting " solidarity " -- a party which had been banned
