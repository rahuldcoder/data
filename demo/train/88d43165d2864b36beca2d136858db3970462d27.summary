-- it is almost miraculous that three women who have been missing for a decade have turned up			1
the story of @entity4 , who screamed for help and got the attention of a neighbor who broke down a door that set her and two other women free , is riveting			2
police have already arrested three suspects			0
as details emerge in the coming days , many people are asking : how could something like this happen ? why did the police not find them earlier ? there are far more questions than answers at this point			0
although the terms abduction and missing have become almost synonymous , they are not quite the same			2
in sexually motivated abduction cases , the child is usually returned before anyone had time to note the child was even missing			1
the motivation is easier to evaluate , and the investigation usually focuses primarily on any sexual assault			0
in long - term missing / abduction cases , the motivation is harder to evaluate , and the investigation usually focuses more on finding the " missing " child			1
such cases are among the most difficult , frustrating and emotionally draining for law enforcement			1
children can be missing for a wide variety of reasons ( e.g. , runaway , throwaway , lost , injured , etc. ) other than abduction and can be abducted for a wide variety of motivations ( profit , ransom , custodial disputes , etc. ) other than sex			1
for long - separated families , reunions can be a struggle what investigators are often presented with is simply the fact that a child is missing -- the child did not return home as expected			1
@entity57 and friends want an immediate and aggressive response by law enforcement with the issuing of @entity62			1
law enforcement , however , must consider and evaluate all possibilities			1
especially in cases involving teenagers or families living a chaotic lifestyle , determining that an abduction even took place can be difficult			1
it is simply not possible or reasonable for law enforcement to respond to every missing child case as if it were a sexually motivated nonfamily abduction			1
the vast majority of missing children are missing because they were runaways , lost , accidentally injured or gone for a variety of benign reasons ( e.g. , lost track of time )			1
a runaway or lured - away child , however , can easily become an abducted child when prevented from returning home			2
in sexually motivated abduction cases , a child will usually be held only long enough for the offender to engage in some amount of sexual activity			1
a few sex offenders , however , seem to want to believe they will live happily ever after with their abducted victim as a sex partner			2
in a few cases ( e.g. , @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 and @entity96 ) victims have surfaced alive many months or years after being abducted			0
many parents of long missing children understandably pray that their children are among such victims			2
in cases in which the victims are held and kept alive long term , the offender must have a method of control beyond just typical threats and violence			2
in my experience , this has sometimes involved the assistance of one or more accomplices or the use of physical controls such as a remote location , soundproof room , underground chamber or elaborate restraining devices			0
it also usually involves an evolving and changing relationship between the offender and the child victim			0
the offender gradually moves from being a stranger using force to an acquaintance using seduction to a father - like or domestic figure using a family - like bond			0
in some cases in which i have been involved , victims have been left alone , were poorly guarded , did not try to escape or seemed almost compliant in a variety of ways in their victimization			0
victims may even feel guilt , shame and embarrassment or blame themselves as a result of this			0
in my opinion , the victims who survived the odds did the right thing , whatever it was			0
the @entity149 case is one in which society and the criminal justice system struggled with abduction victim accountability for behavior that helped lead to survival			2
some prefer to explain this as being the result of a mysterious process called " brainwashing " or the " @entity161			0
" i see it as a perfectly understandable result of adult / child interaction and influence over time			0
a survival and interdependency bond may develop			0
it is a kind of adaptation or learned helplessness			0
this process can vary significantly based on the personality characteristics of both the offender and victim			0
the case of the three @entity177 women who have escaped their captor after so long is inspiring and offers hope for other cases			1
but most long - term nonfamily - child abduction cases , unfortunately , do not have such happy endings			1
however , that should not prevent the continuing efforts to resolve them			0
the greatest accomplishment of almost any law enforcement investigator would be to be able to return a missing child to his or her parents			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity192 .			2

@entity194 : it is almost miraculous that three women missing for a decade turned up
@entity192 : long - term missing cases are the most difficult and draining for law enforcement
he says majority of missing kids go missing because they were runaways , lost or injured
@entity177 case inspiring , but most long - term abduction cases do *n't* end happily , he says
