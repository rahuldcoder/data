@entity0 , @entity1 -- sister @entity3 works round the clock			1
twenty - four hours a day , seven days a week			1
she says she only takes one day off each year during the @entity6 festival of @entity7			0
" i have to be here , " she says , showing us her modest two - room health clinic in @entity1			1
" the women of this village need me			0
" nurse @entity13 is part of a community of health workers leading the battle against malnutrition in @entity19 , a poor district in the western state of @entity0			1
back in 2006 , @entity0 fared poorly in the @entity1 government 's @entity21			1
the @entity1 - wide report showed that 40 % of @entity0 's children were underweight , an indication of general malnutrition			1
" data speaks , " says @entity27 , @entity28 and nutrition specialist at @entity30			1
she says it 's a shame that a country that has grown economically has made very little progress when it comes to looking after its children			1
despite two decades of robust economic growth , levels of malnutrition in @entity1 remain alarmingly high			1
according to the @entity45 and @entity46 survey conducted by the @entity48 foundation , 42 % of @entity1 children under the age of five are underweight			1
that 's more than @entity50			2
the @entity1 prime minister @entity51 says it is a " matter of national shame			2
" @entity54 heads the @entity55 of @entity0			2
she agrees that levels of malnutrition across @entity1 are very worrying but firmly believes the small steps being taken in the region will make a big difference			1
following the 2006 report , the @entity0 state government teamed up with @entity30 to launch a new initiative that focuses on the first 1,000 days of a child 's life -- starting in the womb			1
@entity65 says this is the period when children are most vulnerable			2
but she adds , " it 's also the window of opportunity			0
if you catch them at that age and address malnutrition and give them the right nutrition , the right childcare , some love and attention , then we can tackle this issue			0
" that 's exactly what a team of health workers is trying to do across @entity0			1
nurses like @entity13 handle the early days			0
at her clinic , sister @entity3 regularly holds counseling sessions during which she tells pregnant women what to eat and how to experience a healthy pregnancy			0
many of the women who come to her clinic are poor and illiterate			0
they used to have lots of misconceptions about pregnancy , says sister @entity3			0
for example , they would not take any vitamins because they would worry that pills would make the baby too big , leading to a difficult childbirth			0
" i started telling them , take your vitamins and folic acid tablets			0
your body knows its limit			0
the baby will grow accordingly			0
" she tells us she 's delivered 96 babies since april this year			0
all of them were above 2.5 kilograms			0
not a single one was underweight			0
sister @entity3 continues counseling women for a few months after they give birth -- then , a team of anganwadi workers takes over			2
@entity121 means courtyard in @entity123			0
typically , a government - run anganwadi will provide children with a range of facilities -- pre-school , counseling , basic health care and meals -- around a central courtyard			1
the anganwadis are playing a crucial role in fighting malnutrition in @entity0			1
at the center we visit , anganwadi workers check the height and weight of children twice a week and are constantly on the lookout for children who are stunted or underweight			1
" my main goal is to keep the children healthy , both mentally and physically , " says @entity145 who has been an anganwadi worker for 10 years			2
one of the 24 children she looks after is moderately underweight			2
at two years and 11 months , @entity145 tells us @entity150 should weigh 12 kilograms			0
so @entity145 has got @entity150 's mother involved			0
she 's told her what to feed the child and when to give her meals			2
she 's also advised her to stock a low shelf with nutritious snacks such as peanut balls to that @entity150 can help herself whenever she 's hungry			0
timely intervention likes this appears to be making a difference in @entity0			2
@entity65 says she 's awaiting results of a state - wide survey on nutrition levels but tells @entity2 that early data shows malnutrition in children has halved in @entity0 since 2006			1
the key , she says is to focus on the first 1,000 days of a child 's life -- and to find a few local heroes like @entity13 .			1

2006 report showed that 40 % of @entity0 state 's children were underweight
despite @entity1 's two decades of economic growth , malnutrition remains alarmingly high
@entity0 working with @entity30 on program that focuses on first 1,000 days of child 's life
government - run anganwadi provide schooling , counseling and basic health care
