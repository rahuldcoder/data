-- researchers around the world are being asked to help stop the largest known @entity4 outbreak in history			1
an emergency research " all call " was issued thursday by @entity8 and the @entity10 's @entity9 amid rising cases of @entity12 in the west @entity14 countries of @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18			1
money for @entity4 research will be made available from a $ 10.8 million initiative funded by the trust and the government department			1
@entity8 is also making an additional five - year commitment for $ 66.5 million to " develop the next generation of @entity14 health researchers , " it said in a statement			0
this money will go toward @entity30 scientists who are studying neglected tropical diseases , hiv , tuberculosis and other diseases , according to a press release			0
experts are being asked to submit their proposals for treatments , details on @entity4 and how it spreads , along with strategies on how to prevent its transmission			1
these proposals will be reviewed immediately , the statement said , so that research can start as soon as possible			0
" we are launching an emergency call for research to strengthen what we know about @entity4 and how it spreads , " international development secretary @entity47 said in a statement			2
" this will help us better equip those working on the ground so they can tackle the outbreak as effectively as possible and prevent more people contracting this terrible disease			1
" @entity8 director dr @entity60 says the gravity of the @entity4 epidemic demands an " urgent response			2
" " we believe rapid research into humanitarian interventions and therapeutics can have an impact on treatment and containment during the present outbreak			2
what we learn could also change the way we approach future outbreaks , providing us with tested tools and techniques that were not available to public health authorities this time , " he said			0
in an opinion piece published in the journal nature on wednesday , @entity78 epidemiologist @entity77 said " tens of thousands of doses of experimental drugs are needed to fight " the deadly @entity4 outbreak happening in the @entity14 countries of @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18			1
as of wednesday , the number of deaths from @entity4 had reached 1,350 , according to the @entity87			1
@entity77 and two of his colleagues pooled available data to estimate how many doses would be required to fight the epidemic , identifying key risk groups that require help and looking at probable levels of exposure			2
they found " up to 30,000 people so far would have required experimental drugs and vaccines " in the current outbreak			1
they concluded that the demand for medicine to treat people with @entity4 and prevent further transmission is likely to be higher than most experts realize			1
@entity77 warned that both production and distribution must be scaled up to allow for equitable roll - out of any experimental drugs			1
currently there is no approved or scientifically proven drugs to treat @entity4 , and no vaccine			1
treatment consists of giving fluids , monitoring vital signs and responding to acute medical crisis			0
finding that treatment is key in preventing future outbreaks and the spread of the disease , experts say			2
already several experimental drugs are in development			1
one , @entity125 was given to @entity127 @entity126 and dr. @entity128 when they were seriously ill. @entity129 seem to be doing well in a hospital in @entity131			0
more recently , the drug was given to three health care workers in @entity16 who are also recovering			0
but researchers say there still is n't enough evidence to say whether the drug will be effective in other patients			0
there is continuing pressure on drug companies and researchers to produce a treatment that could work for the masses			0
the immediate need has put the @entity147 drug approval process to the test and challenged them to be more lenient			0
the ebola therapy drug @entity4 has already been tested for safety in small clinical trials , but until now was n't approved by the @entity147 for use in patients			2
a shipment of 800 to 1,000 doses of the vaccine , known as @entity158 , were delivered to health officials in @entity16 , as a donation from the @entity161 last week			0
it 's unclear if anyone in @entity14 has received the vaccine			0
the @entity165 agency said its stockpile is gone			0
@entity167 , which produces @entity125 , said it has also sent its entire stock of the experimental drug overseas			0
only the facts : @entity4 experimental drugs			1

new : global initiative against outbreak , disease *announced* in @entity10
epidemiologist says 30,00 people would require experimental drugs , vaccines
who : number of deaths in @entity4 outbreak has reached 1,350
right now there is no proven treatment or vaccine for @entity4
