his middle name was @entity2 , and that 's what his whereabouts have been for the last 37 years			1
maybe , the story went , @entity6 was disposed of under the old @entity7 in @entity8			1
or perhaps he was buried in a @entity10 horse farm			2
one colleague said his body had been incinerated			2
still another theory was that he was taken to a @entity15 swamp as alligator food			2
or , as one person said at the time of his disappearance , he was n't dead at all			2
he 'd taken off to @entity20 in the company of a go - go dancer			2
to date , none of these theories have panned out			2
but wherever the truth may lie , one thing is for certain : @entity6 -- former @entity27 leader , convicted felon , @entity29 enemy and alleged mobster cohort -- has n't been seen since july 30 , 1975			1
on friday , police again looked for the union boss , who was declared dead in 1982 , under the driveway of a house in @entity35 , @entity10 , just outside @entity36			0
a tipster told police that a body was buried at the spot around the same time the @entity27 head disappeared			1
police found no " discernible remains " in the search , police chief @entity41 said			2
it 's a disappearance that has held on to the public 's imagination far longer than @entity6 was in power -- a testament both to @entity6 's high profile and the power of mystery , says pop culture expert @entity52 of @entity53			1
" in this world of enlightenment and science and blogs and the @entity63 , there are still a few mysteries , " he says , ticking off the @entity54 and the questions surrounding the @entity29 assassination as other examples			0
digging into the @entity6 legend ? a bad boy with a lingering legacy indeed , @entity6 's disappearance seems ready - made for such speculation			1
he was an incredibly influential figure , perhaps the most famous union leader of his time -- a time when labor presidents such as the @entity76 ' @entity75 and the @entity78 's @entity77 regularly commanded headlines			2
he maintained a base in @entity36 , blue - collar home of the brawny auto industry			0
and he had a bad - boy aura , both for his pugnacious leadership and his alleged ties to organized crime			0
in fact , some @entity29 conspiracy theories tie @entity6 to the president 's assassination			1
part of the @entity6 fascination certainly comes from the attention his disappearance earned at the time , says @entity52			1
but it 's the organized crime touch that gives the story a jolt of electricity			0
" you get the voltage that comes from the media coverage that turned this into a myth , " he says , " ( as well as ) what it was he did , which is not only the stuff of news , but the stuff of ' @entity109 ' and ' @entity110			0
' " there are also the circumstances leading up to his death			0
two weeks before @entity6 's disappearance in 1975 , federal investigators discovered that hundreds of millions of dollars had been stolen from the @entity27 ' largest pension fund , @entity116 points out in its list of the top 10 most famous disappearances			1
@entity6 was last seen at @entity123 restaurant in suburban @entity36 , ostensibly to meet with reputed @entity125 street enforcer @entity124 and @entity126 , chief of a @entity27 local in @entity8 , who was later convicted in a murder case			1
@entity6 believed @entity124 had set up the meeting to help settle a feud between @entity6 and @entity126 , but @entity6 was the only one who showed up for the meeting , according to the @entity132			1
@entity124 and @entity126 later told the @entity132 that no meeting had been scheduled			0
both men have since died			0
the current tipster used to do business with a man who had ties to @entity124			0
it 's no wonder that @entity6 has inspired several @entity141 films , including " @entity142 " ( a 1983 tv movie about @entity6 , the @entity144 and gangsters that starred tough guy @entity146 ) , " @entity6 " ( a 1992 feature starring @entity148 and written by @entity149 ) and " @entity150 " ( a 1978 film about a fictionalized @entity6 , starring @entity152 )			1
new chapter in the search let missing union leaders lie ? the appeal of the unsolved mystery runs deep , of course			2
they 're the bread and butter of police procedurals : there 's a reason that such shows as " csi " and " bones " have had such long lives ( never mind the enduring attraction of @entity170 , who 's also the subject of a new tv series )			0
such mysteries also touch on our interest in the supernatural , whether it 's over religious icons , ghosts or visitors from outer space			0
and , like an audience pondering a well - executed magic trick , there 's something to be said for our inability to simply figure something out , despite having all the clues at our fingertips			0
" for years now , we have had the sense that stuff is provable and solvable			0
whenever anything defies that , it naturally becomes the stuff of extreme curiosity , " says @entity52			0
of course , these stories tend to have an expiration date , and more than a generation after his disappearance , @entity6 's may be nearing his			1
before @entity6 , one of the most famous missing - persons cases was that of @entity202 justice @entity201 , who disappeared in 1930 -- like @entity6 , he was last seen in a restaurant -- and inspired years of speculation and pop culture references ( " @entity201 , call your office " was a popular one - liner )			1
though the @entity201 mystery has yet to be solved , few people are even aware of the judge anymore			0
why should they be ? it was a lifetime ago			0
besides , if the @entity6 mystery is solved , that fascination will likely be replaced by letdown			1
sometimes it 's better -- at least for the sake of pop culture riffs -- to let missing union leaders lie			0
" this idea that nobody knows what happened to @entity6 represents something i think we need and hold on to , " says @entity52			1
" the inability of the human mind to solve the @entity6 disappearance story was actually important to our collective soul in a weird sort of way			1
" @entity6 case reopened , again			1
