-- @entity2 users who have n't yet discovered the joys of @entity4 or plugged in to the sounds of @entity6 will be getting an easier way to find apps that run on the site			1
on thursday , the site unveiled @entity11 , a clearinghouse for social apps that sounds a lot like @entity16 's online store			1
and while most will likely remain free ( with some making money through in - game purchases ) , @entity2 will also now allow paid apps on the site			1
" for the over 900 million people that use @entity2 , the @entity11 will become the new , central place to find great apps like @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity6 , @entity31 , @entity32 , and @entity33 , " @entity2 's @entity21 wrote on the site 's page for developers			1
a life without @entity2 : are you off the site ? tell us why the center will be available on the @entity39 and on both @entity16 's ios and @entity43 's @entity42 operating systems			1
it will roll out to users over the next few weeks , according to @entity21 's post			0
@entity2 will use " a variety of signals , such as user ratings and engagement " to determine which apps are added to the @entity11 and which get most prominently displayed			1
" well - designed apps that people enjoy will be prominently displayed , " @entity21 wrote			0
" apps that receive poor user ratings or do n't meet the quality guidelines wo n't be listed			2
" developers are being asked to create an app detail page , that will give potential users details about the app and be accessible to web searches			0
those pages are due by may 18 , signaling that a full rollout might not happen until after then			0
and in a move that mirrors @entity16 and @entity42 app stores , developers will now be given the option of charging a one - time fee for their apps			1
" many developers have been successful with in - app purchases , but to support more types of apps on @entity2 , we will give developers the option to offer paid apps , " @entity21 wrote			1
@entity2 currently makes about 15 % of its money through payments in games and other apps			2
@entity84 , owners of @entity4 , @entity29 and other successful games , are responsible for the majority of those payments			0
@entity2 takes a 30 % cut of the payments			0
the center rolls out at an opportune time for @entity2 , as it prepares for an initial public stock offering			2
@entity2 has not yet found a way to make money on the increasing number of users who access the site through mobile devices			2
becoming more visible to @entity96 and @entity42 users may be a move in that direction , easing investor concerns in the process			0
most initial tech - world reactions thursday were positive			0
" so far , i see nothing not to thumbs - up here , " wrote @entity103 for @entity104			0
" a user - related ranking and inclusion system ? a chance to investigate an app before installing it ? a way for developers to compete on more level terms with @entity16 and @entity43 with regard to app pricing ? everything in one central location ? app agnosticism when it comes to platform and installation ? " sure , it means a little extra work for developers and new challenge metrics for getting an app included as well as made visible , but the end benefits for users , at least on e-paper , seem broadly win - win at this point			2
