-- @entity1 has agreed a new contract with @entity3 , which will keep the @entity4 at the @entity6 club until 2018			1
the 25 - year - old already had a deal that expired with the @entity10 giants in 2016 , but that has now been extended by two years			1
@entity1 has been in sensational form this year , scoring 90 goals for both club and country to surpass the previous goalscoring record for a calendar year set by @entity18 in 1972 , when the @entity19 scored 85 goals			2
the 21 - time @entity6 champions have also verbally agreed new deals with midfielder @entity23 , who will extend his contract from 2014 until 2016 , while defender @entity25 , whose contract had been due to expire next year , will stay with @entity3 until 2016			1
none of the players has yet to put pen to paper on their new contracts but the @entity3 website says this will happen " over the course of the next few weeks "			0
" this news means that @entity3 has secured its ties with three of its most important players , " the club said on its official website			0
while both club captain @entity25 , 34 , and @entity23 , 32 , are significant figures at the club , @entity3 officials are likely to look upon the extension of @entity1 's deal as the most important			1
widely regarded as the best footballer in the world , the diminutive @entity45 international has often spoke of the debt of gratitude he believes he owes the @entity51 club			0
at the age of 11 , @entity1 was diagnosed with a growth hormone deficiency and neither his existing club in his home town @entity56 -- @entity58 -- nor @entity59 giants @entity60 were prepared to provide the money to treat his condition , which amounted to some us $ 1,000 per month			2
instead , @entity3 , who had been made aware of his talents , offered to pay the medical bills of a boy who stood just 4ft 6in as long as he was prepared to move to @entity67 , a decision which @entity1 confirmed when signing his first contract with the club on the back of a paper napkin			2
the 13 - year - old moved to @entity3 with his family in 2000 -- and the rest is ( ongoing ) history			1
despite his tender age , @entity1 has amassed a staggering collection of trophies and records			0
since making his @entity3 debut in 2003 , he has collected three @entity83 crowns , two @entity85 titles , five @entity6 league championships and two @entity88 medals			2
along the way , he has scored more goals for the club in both the @entity6 league and @entity10 competition than any other player in @entity3 's illustrious 113 - year history			1
on a personal basis , he has won three consecutive @entity98 titles and is favorite to beat teammate @entity99 and @entity101 's @entity100 to win this year 's @entity98 ( as the award became known in 2010 )			0
should he do so , @entity1 will become the first footballer to win the prestigious honor on four separate occasions -- a record that would be made all the more notable by the absence of a @entity85 winner 's medal in his cabinet			0
for despite winning the 1995 @entity111 and the @entity112 with @entity45 , @entity1 has yet to go past the quarterfinals of the @entity85 -- and many commentators believe he needs to win that trophy if he is to lay claim to being the greatest footballer the world has ever seen .			0

@entity1 agrees two - year extension to current deal
contract will tie @entity4 to @entity3 until he is *31*
@entity23 and @entity25 also agree new deals with @entity6 giants
