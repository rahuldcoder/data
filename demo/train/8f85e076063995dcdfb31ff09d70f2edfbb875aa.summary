-- nearly 20 years have passed , but @entity1 still ca n't get rid of the sensation in his nostrils			2
" do you know what it smells like ? i can still smell that smell -- the one of burning flesh			2
" it has been like that ever since the horrific day his mother woke him from his slumber with screams usually only heard in nightmares			2
on july 18 , 1994 , a bomb was set off at the @entity18 in @entity19 , killing 85 people and wounding about 300			1
" there were bodies everywhere , " @entity21 , who was 18 at the time , told @entity0			2
" but it 's the smell which lingered			2
" i remember arriving and knowing that so many people who i knew were inside that building -- i knew so many of those who were murdered			2
" i just wanted to help			0
i wanted to help rescue those below the rubble , and worked for hours trying to get people out alive			0
" it was chaos -- there was blood , flesh ... people did n't know what to do			0
some could n't stay and help , it was too difficult			0
" but there were people i knew who would have been there			0
i can still see people 's faces			2
" on saturday , @entity1 , like many of those affected by the bomb , will turn his attention to @entity51 's footballers and their @entity53 meeting with @entity54 -- the country blamed for the atrocity			1
@entity51 prosecutors accuse @entity54 of helping coordinate and plan the attack through a @entity60 cell in the region			1
nobody has claimed responsibility for the attack , and @entity54 vehemently denies any involvement			1
it 's the first time @entity51 has faced @entity54 in football since that fateful day -- and its 250,000 - strong @entity18 community , the largest in @entity68 , wants its dead remembered			1
in a june 3 letter sent to @entity72 president @entity71 , the @entity73 requests " at the beginning of this match , a minute of silence in memory of the victims , in commemoration of the 20th anniversary of the attack and all these years of impunity			1
" the move , which is unlikely to be successful as a spokesman for the global game 's ruling body says it has not received a request from the @entity88 , has brought fresh publicity to the search for justice			2
as well as the smell of burning flesh , the image of bodies laid strewn across the ground remains a permanent fixture in @entity21 's consciousness after the building , the heartbeat of the @entity18 community in the @entity51 capital , was reduced to ruins			1
" you do n't forget things like that , " he says quietly			0
" i stood there with boyfriends , husbands , wives , girlfriends , all of us digging and hoping to find a loved one			0
" i could see people trapped but i knew if i took a wrong step , more rubble could fall upon them			0
" some people just could n't handle it -- the smell was enough to turn a lot of volunteers away			0
" so many people died ... so many			0
" in february 2013 , @entity51 lawmakers agreed to work with @entity54 to investigate the attack -- a move which was met with skepticism			1
the formation of a five - person panel -- named the " @entity131 " -- was passed by a 131 - 113 vote following an intense 14 - hour debate			0
the move was struck down by the @entity135 , which ruled it unconstitutional , and a government appeal will now be heard in the country 's @entity137			0
in 2007 , @entity139 requested the arrest of several @entity54 in connection with the bombing , including @entity54 's former defense minister @entity143			1
while the request for a minute 's silence on saturday is unlikely to come to fruition , there will be a short remembrance service before the game on @entity150 's @entity149 , where @entity151 , @entity51 and @entity152 from across the world are expected to gather			1
one of those hoping to be present is @entity155 , who has traveled from @entity19 to @entity156 as part of a separate project aiming to connect @entity18 football fans at the @entity53			1
@entity155 and his wife , @entity160 , received a charity grant to help launch activities for @entity18 supporters who are in @entity156 for the tournament			1
many of them will attend the ceremony on @entity149 before watching the game , which is being played 216 miles away in @entity169			0
" as jews , we are always looking to show that we want to find justice , " said @entity155			0
" we see this game between @entity51 and @entity54 as a great opportunity to tell the world that this case is still unresolved and there have been no convictions			1
" @entity139 , which won its opening game against @entity179 , will begin as a heavy favorite against @entity54 on saturday			1
led by @entity182 's four - time world player of the year @entity181 , @entity51 is expected to reach the later stages and possibly even win the tournament for the first time since 1986			1
but for many , a moment of silence before kickoff in @entity169 would resonate loudest			2
" we 're asking for a minute 's silence because it deserves to be respected , " @entity21 says			1
" i think that the world should know that this was an act of terror which has impacted on both nations			0
" we can not allow ourselves to forget what happened			0
" for @entity1 the memories remain raw -- and the smell refuses to go away .			0
