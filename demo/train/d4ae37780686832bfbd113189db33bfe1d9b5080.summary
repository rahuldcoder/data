-- @entity1 , please say it is n't so			1
that was the overwhelming sentiment of women i chatted with on @entity6 , @entity7 and over e-mail after i heard reports that @entity1 , wife of embattled @entity11 mayoral candidate @entity10 , might partly blame herself for her husband 's return to sexting			1
an @entity1 family member reportedly told @entity15 that she blamed herself , in part , for ending couples counseling last year and focusing on her newborn son around the same time @entity10 got back to his explicit digital contacts with women			1
i checked in with women around the country , most of whom i interviewed last week about @entity1 's decision to stick with her husband , to take their pulse			1
@entity10 's wife : should @entity1 stand by her man ? " what a sad thing to hear , that @entity1 blames herself , but it 's not so unusual , is it ? " said @entity30 , a mom of two and freelance writer in @entity32 , @entity11			1
" when relationships hit the rocks , does n't everyone have those ' what did i do to deserve this ? ' thoughts			2
" @entity41 says she knows exactly what @entity1 is going through			2
she put up with her husband 's infidelities for years , she said , and that battered her self - worth			2
" when a woman 's self - esteem is already low , and she is already so insecure , it is easy for a man like this to bend her thinking in a way that makes her feel as if she is the one who failed somehow , " the divorced mom of a teenager said			2
" for so long , that 's how i felt			2
" @entity58 , a married public relations executive in @entity59 , said if she were @entity1 's friend , she 'd tell her she feels terrible she is choosing to " carry this burden on her own shoulders			1
" " but this is not her burden to carry , " she said			0
" her husband is an adult who made choices , and those choices resulted in actions that have impacted his family , his career and even himself			0
" sources : @entity1 considered leaving @entity10 last fall @entity74 , a married mom of two in @entity76 , @entity77 , believes @entity1 's " self - blame stance " is " very generous			1
" " i do n't really believe that she believes this , but she is very brave in voicing that a relationship -- all the ups and downs -- involve two people , " @entity74 said			0
" what saddens me , but does not make me think negatively of @entity1 , is that she seems to be making all the sacrifices to keep her family , her husband 's career and her career together			1
" it is not surprising and very common for women to blame themselves when a spouse or partner strays , says dr. @entity94 , a @entity95 - based psychologist and associate professor at @entity97			2
women in these situations , says @entity94 , are looking for hope , power or control			0
" if i acknowledge i am powerless to stop his behavior , that is very disheartening , " she said			0
" if i can figure out what i did wrong , i can figure out how to fix it , and if you tell me that i did n't do anything wrong , then what do i do with that ? " @entity1 dines with @entity114 spokesman @entity94 also said it can be very hard for a woman such as @entity1 , who has been very successful in her career and is not accustomed to " losing			1
" " it can be very disorienting to say how is it that in every other area of my life , i 've been able to achieve , and now in this area it looks like a failure , " she said , adding the best advice for women who are in @entity1 's shoes is to get individual counseling as well as couples therapy			1
@entity130 , a married mom of two , says she knows plenty of people who have blamed themselves for their significant other 's choices , and that she was also guilty of it in a past relationship			0
" but either you live in denial of reality or you eventually face the facts in the situation : she did n't make him seek something outside their marriage			0
he did that all on his own , " she said			0
we , as women , are wired to be fixers , @entity130 added			0
" but the important thing is to realize that the only person who can ' fix ' infidelity is the one who chose to commit it			0
" follow @entity156 on @entity7 and like @entity157 on @entity6 .			0
