@entity0 -- a @entity5 nuclear plant will shut down its reactors after the country 's prime minister warned it was vulnerable to natural disasters , its owner announced monday			1
the @entity10 said it will take two of its reactors at the @entity13 nuclear plant off line and not bring a third back on line , effectively shutting down the plant			1
in a statement , the company said , " at the may 9 , 2011 meeting of the @entity20 , @entity21 , has decided to suspend operations of @entity23 until further measures to prevent tsunami ( damage ) are completed , as requested by the prime minister			2
" prime minister @entity28 said last week that the plant -- located on the @entity30 in @entity13 , southwest of @entity0 -- could produce " grave damage to @entity5 " similar to the problems at the @entity37 nuclear power plant , and wanted earthquake and tsunami protections put in place			1
@entity38 , president of @entity21 , said safety was the company 's first priority			2
meanwhile , workers reentered the no. 1 reactor building at the crippled @entity37 nuclear power plant monday as they try to restore its cooling system , the plant 's operator said			1
nine @entity49 employees and two representatives from @entity5 's @entity51 spent about 30 minutes in the building measuring radiation levels			2
on thursday , workers went into the damaged facility for the first time since a magnitude - 9.0 earthquake and ensuing tsunami in march			1
they installed a ventilation system that is filtering radioactive substances from the air			0
the purpose of monday 's visit was to see how successful the system has been			0
once the radioactive contamination in the air is lowered enough , workers will be able stay in the building longer to install a cooling system that @entity71 wants to use to perform a cold shut down of the reactor			1
cooling systems at @entity37 , about 240 kilometers ( 150 miles ) north of @entity0 , were knocked out by the devastating tsunami that struck @entity5 's @entity30 after a massive earthquake march 11			1
the disaster triggered the worst nuclear accident since @entity79 as the cores of reactors 1 - 3 overheated and spewed huge amounts of radioactive contamination across the surrounding area			2
the buildings that house reactors 1 and 3 were blown apart by hydrogen explosions in the first days of the crisis			0
another hydrogen buildup is believed to have ruptured a water reservoir beneath the no. 2 reactor			0
in april , @entity71 laid out a six - to nine - month timetable for winding down the crisis and bringing the reactors to a complete shutdown			0
the disaster has led to mandatory evacuations of about 78,000 people living within 20 kilometers ( 12.5 miles ) of the plant			0
people living another 10 kilometers away -- or at least another 60,000 people -- have been ordered to remain sheltered			0
@entity100 , @entity101 and @entity102 contributed to this report			0

@entity10 says it is shutting down reactors at the @entity13 nuclear plant
ventilating the reactor building at @entity37 will allow employees to work there longer
an earthquake and tsunami hit the nuclear facility on march 11
reactor workers and nuclear safety officials measure radiation at the plant
