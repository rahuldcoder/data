-- one of the many characters @entity2 played on - screen insisted that he was n't an actor but a movie star			1
the real @entity2 , who died saturday in @entity7 at 81 , was triumphantly a great actor and a great screen idol			1
he played a variety of roles , from meek ( 1969 's " @entity11 " ) to bombastic ( 1968 's " @entity12 " )			0
in the process , he yielded a body of work that , taken together , was likely more varied than any actor of the prodigious , mostly hell - raising generation of male actors that emerged as screen icons mid- 20th century			2
( in terms of variety , only @entity21 challenges @entity2 , but not @entity24 , @entity25 or @entity26			1
) here are five of his best movies , in my view , and the ones most representative of his life 's work			0
what 's your own list ? it 's through this ongoing evaluation that artists such as @entity2 live on : 1			1
" @entity40 " ( 1980 ) as the imperious moviemaker @entity41 , @entity2 is a loose cannon : manipulative , abusive , self - centered -- but nowhere near as wicked as he should be			2
the reason this leads my list of @entity2 's best performances is that it encompasses just about everything about him that was inimitable : feline physical grace , a musician 's timing , a writer 's instinct for nuance , bravura rhetorical flourishes and a boundless capacity to keep his audiences off - balance even when he 's not speaking or moving			2
" @entity59 " ( 1962 ) it was n't his first movie role			1
( that came in 1960 's " kidnapped			0
" ) it just seems that way			0
fifty - one years have passed since @entity67 's desert epic was released and @entity2 's dominant , star - making performance as the flamboyant @entity69 remains among the most galvanic big - screen breakthroughs in movie history			1
it also set in motion the dispiriting pattern of @entity2 being nominated for the best actor @entity76 and losing			1
@entity77 was a nice man and his @entity78 in " @entity80 " was an even nicer man			0
but in retrospect , they should n't have won the @entity76 that , in retrospect , had @entity2 's name all over it			1
they needed to get it right the first time			0
instead , they denied him six more times , even for his performance as a dying actor in 2006 's " @entity94 , " which came three years after he received a lifetime achievement @entity76			1
" @entity97 " ( 1982 ) @entity2 's portrayal of @entity99 , aging movie swashbuckler who 's not so devil - may - care when it comes to the demands of 1950s live tv , may well have been his most widely beloved role			1
his boisterous physical comedy fits the raucous surrounds like an old shoe ( with a hole in the sole			0
) his @entity113 also has melancholy moments , but he always keeps the characterand the movie from going to the maudlin zone			2
" @entity118 " ( 1972 ) by this time in his career , @entity2 had assembled a curriculum vitae that included at least two overwrought @entity122 kings ( 1964 's " @entity123 " and 1968 's " @entity12 " ) , two self - tortured adventurers ( 1962 's " @entity59 " and 1965 's " @entity125 " ) , a manic @entity126 ( 1965 's " @entity127 " ) and @entity128 ( 1972 's " @entity129 " )			1
this dark comedy 's lead character , lord @entity130 , seems a barking - mad composite of these personalities			0
at the beginning , @entity130 's a shaggy , blithe species of maniac who 's been called to his family estate to do whatever 's expected of a well - heeled nobleman			0
problem is , he 's convinced that he is @entity143			0
when i pray to @entity144 , i find i am talking to myself			0
" this brand of crazy is far more blissful than the malevolent kind that takes over the 14th @entity148 when his hair is cut and his demeanor made more " respectable " to his peers			0
the movie is a tad overlong and may leave you with an acrid aftertaste			0
but @entity2 bowls you over with the effortless way he enchants you at one end of the movie and frightens you at the other			1
" @entity159 " ( 2005 ) in the late autumn of his career , @entity2 eased into being more character actor than movie star and infused even the most offhand role ( e.g. the voice of snooty restaurant critic @entity165 in @entity167 's 2007 's " @entity165 " ) with immaculate polish and unassuming mastery			1
my own favorite from this period comes in this latest adaptation of the @entity176 children 's classic , " @entity174 , " in which @entity2 plays the gruff @entity177 of @entity178 , who 's forbidding on the outside but keeps the fuzzy kindness deep within the tempered steel			2
often , it 's in the miniature parts rather than the major ones that you see where real poetry can come from			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity190 .			2

@entity2 was an outstanding actor and a movie star , writes @entity190
he showed his *versatility* in everything from " @entity59 " to " @entity97 "
@entity197 : @entity2 deserved , but did n't get , an @entity76 for performance as @entity69
he says @entity2 enchants and frightens the viewer of " @entity118 "
