-- for years , @entity2 's work meant business trips , investment plans and high - level meetings with powerful politicians and top corporate executives			1
having worked at @entity8 , the @entity9 and even as an adviser to the president of @entity14 , @entity11 's illustrious career had taken him to @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17			1
and then his hibernating entrepreneurial spirit kicked in			0
last may , @entity11 swapped business suits for casual clothes , and strategic pitches for delicious pastries as he decided to go into business on his own , opening up @entity24 , a high - end bakery and coffee shop in @entity27 , the bustling capital of @entity14 with some one million residents			1
" my friends said i was a bit crazy to leave a well - established institution and job to venture into business -- i guess maybe they are right partly but i really felt it was what i wanted to do , " says the 38 - year - old entrepreneur			2
" for some reason , i always had this entrepreneurial drive so i decided to walk the talk instead of preaching for private sector development , " he adds			0
" i looked for an opportunity that both made business sense and would excite me			0
a quality coffee shop was both a gap in the market and something i was really interested in -- i love good food , good drinks and good service			0
" drawing inspiration from successful international chains like @entity53 , @entity54 and @entity55 , @entity11 says he wanted to start what he calls a " boutique " bakery in @entity14 that could fit in any country in the world			1
and when it came to naming his new venture , the entrepreneur did n't have to think too hard -- he just trusted his taste buds			0
" @entity24 is a very popular bread in some parts of @entity15 and it is definitely my favorite kind of bread , " says @entity2 , who is half @entity14 , half @entity65			1
" we have it with sugar , plain , with chocolate or with raisins			0
" big dreams inside the @entity24 store , a group of black - shirted workers line up in front of a small kitchen counter to prepare a wide range of bakery and pastry products -- from chocolate mousses and croissants to tuna sandwiches and cakes made of locally produced strawberries and mangoes			1
different types of bread and pasta are also on offer here , as well as a variety of coffees and juices			0
" we have about 20,000 items that are being sold each month -- and it is increasing , " says @entity2			2
currently , @entity24 employs 12 people but that number is expected to increase as @entity11 plans to open more stores in @entity27 and beyond			1
" this is the first of many boutiques we want to spread across @entity14 , the region , and @entity17 , " says @entity2			1
" we want to be the @entity53 ! " easy to start a business @entity14 , a tiny landlocked country of more than 11 million people in central @entity17 , has made remarkable economic progress since the end of a brutal genocide that claimed 800,000 lives in 1994			1
according to the @entity113 , the country has moved from a reported poverty rate of about 78 % in 1995 to less than 50 % in 2012 , a year when its economy grew by 8 %			0
a series of legal and administrative reforms also mean that the process of creating a company in @entity14 is fast and affordable			2
as a result , the country is ranked today number nine of 189 economies across the world by the @entity113 index that measures the ease of starting a business -- a sentiment echoed by fledgling businesspeople such as @entity11			1
" you can actually create a company in the morning and receive your incorporation certificate in the afternoon of the same day , " he says			0
yet , there are still many risks that budding entrepreneurs in @entity14 need to navigate			2
" one of the challenges i see not just for a bakery but for many businesses in @entity27 is the fact that we are landlocked and transport costs are huge , " says the @entity24 founder			1
" we do purchase some flour locally but the bulk of it comes from @entity149 and @entity65 , " he adds			0
" electricity is also very expensive			2
" ' no need of aid ' despite such challenges , @entity11 has big plans for the future			0
although @entity24 has yet to make a profit , because of the startup costs , @entity11 eyes bigger growth and has already purchased two more store locations in @entity27			1
he is also planning to build a massive central kitchen so he can maintain quality control and supply all of his @entity24 bakeries in the city			2
" i am a firm believer that @entity17 -- and @entity14 -- is in no need of aid or government programs but of private sector investments , " he says			2
" only private sector investments , in my view , can have the magnitude in terms of scale and creativity that is required to create the millions of jobs that @entity17 needs for its young generation			0
