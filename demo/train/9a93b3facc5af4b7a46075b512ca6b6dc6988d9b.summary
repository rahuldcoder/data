-- @entity1 and @entity2 are seemingly headed in different directions			1
with millions pumped into the squad by its @entity7 owners , @entity1 ended a 19 - year title drought in @entity9 last season and looks set to challenge for league honors and on the @entity13 front for some time			1
after winning seven consecutive league titles from 2002 - 2008 , @entity2 , meanwhile , is now finding it difficult to break into the top two			2

and on saturday , while @entity2 fell 2 - 1 at @entity22 to suffer a fourth straight defeat in all competitions , @entity1 scored twice in injury time to see off a spirited @entity26 and move a point behind idle league leader @entity28			1
just when it appeared as if newly promoted @entity26 would snatch a point in @entity32 , substitute @entity30 pounced on a rebound when keeper @entity34 could n't hold on to @entity36 's header			2
@entity37 doubled the advantage for his first league goal this term to give @entity42 's men two wins and two draws from four outings			0
the host was full value for all three points , hitting the post , crossbar and dominating possession			0
@entity26 's only shot on target , though , was a good one			0
@entity54 stopped @entity55 on a one - on - one approaching the 80th minute			0
two first - half goals from @entity57 were enough for @entity22 to see off @entity2 , which again played without influential attacking duo @entity58 and @entity59 -- @entity2 wants to sell both players			1
there was more misery for @entity2 when star midfielder @entity63 left the game with a leg injury before halftime			0
" a lot of disappointment with this loss and this bad start to the game , " @entity2 midfielder @entity67 told the club website			0
" it 's becoming a habit			0
" @entity28 and @entity79 , along with @entity1 the only other unbeaten teams in @entity78 , face off sunday			2
rampant @entity80 in @entity83 , defending @entity82 champion @entity80 thumped @entity84 for the second time this season , winning 4 - 1 in @entity87			1
@entity88 scored twice and @entity89 continued to find the back of the net since his move from @entity93 , getting @entity80 ' final goal in the 80th minute			0
@entity84 , routed by @entity80 4 - 0 in the @entity95 , had midfielder @entity96 sent off in the 63rd minute for a handball offense , although @entity80 was already leading 3 - 1			1
@entity80 and @entity98 each have the maximum six points through two games in @entity82			2
