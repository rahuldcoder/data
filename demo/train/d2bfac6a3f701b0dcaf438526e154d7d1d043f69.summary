that was the scene on a @entity11 street friday after a car bomb exploded and killed several people			1
some of the dead were reported to be children			2
the blast seemed to mock the truce that the @entity19 government and rebels agreed to abide by earlier this week			1
the truce , negotiated by the @entity23 ' special envoy to @entity19 , was supposed to last during @entity24 , the four - day @entity25 holiday that celebrates the end of the @entity27			1
a @entity19 purportedly at the scene captured a video and posted it on @entity31			1
@entity0 can not verify that the footage is authentic , just like so many amateur videos shot during a war that foreign journalists have been blocked from covering			0
rebels said the blast went off near a playground			2
this kind of violence is n't normal in a neighborhood such as @entity42 , a government - held stronghold			2

" for one day they were trying to make them forgot the bombs and the bullets that are surrounding us			2
" it 's unclear who was behind the bombing			0
@entity19 state media blamed the blast on " terrorists , " a line the government has used since the beginning of the movement against @entity69 began in march 2011			1

@entity19 state media reported that five people were killed and 32 wounded			1

@entity0 is unable to authenticate the footage			0
the idea of a cease - fire was met with skepticism immediately after it was floated on wednesday			1
diplomats , experts in the region and rebels predicted that the agreement would fail			0
they said wednesday and thursday that the effort would just be a repeat of a cease - fire failure in april			1
by sunrise friday , thousands of people poured into the streets across @entity19 to protest against @entity69			2
why region fears @entity69 's ' blackmail ' in @entity181 rebel groups reported these additional bouts of violence across the country : at least three people were killed in tank and sniper fire in a @entity11 suburb where government forces have been battling rebel forces on - and - off for control			1
