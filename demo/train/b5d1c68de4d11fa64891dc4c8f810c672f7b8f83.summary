an unlikely group helped sen. @entity1 capture the @entity3 nomination in a hotly contested primary runoff , but the strategy that propelled him to victory is unlikely to make it into the @entity3 playbook			1
in the final weeks of the election , @entity1 's campaign and allies turned to african - americans and @entity13 to carry the incumbent senator past his tea party challenger			1
@entity18 shot up in counties with the highest @entity21 populations , but @entity1 's success with turning out an unlikely demographic will be hard to replicate elsewhere , several @entity3 strategists said			1
@entity25 political commentator and @entity3 strategist @entity24 emphasized that each election should be treated as an independent race with its own strategy			2
" i think it would be hard to say this is a sign of something that could be replicated in congressional districts or in races around the country , " @entity24 , a former adviser to 2012 @entity3 presidential candidate @entity30 , said			2
a unique scenario played out in @entity38 : because of the state 's open primary system , @entity13 were able to help elect the @entity3 nominee , who is all but certain to win the general election in the solidly @entity3 state			1
the contentious race between an incumbent with a pipeline to federal funds and a more conservative challenger with @entity16 backing jolted blacks into action -- 88 % of whom voted for the @entity13 nominee in the state 's last @entity56 race in 2012 , according to @entity25 exit polls			0
lifelong @entity13 mobilized for @entity1 states in which the same scenario could play out " are few and far between , " @entity3 strategist and @entity25 political commentator @entity59 said			1
" until we find such a rare state , it will do a @entity3 no good to promise more federal spending and benefits to minority voters			1
" bringing home the pork throughout the campaign , @entity1 consistently pointed out his position on the @entity73 and the multimillion - dollar projects he has funded in @entity38 , some of which bear his name , like the @entity79 's @entity78			1
@entity80 , @entity38 , also boasts the @entity81 @entity78 -- a formerly run - down mall that an @entity21 doctor converted into a medical center with @entity1 's support , said @entity86 , political science professor at @entity87			1
" he 's done some things that are not black - specific , but things that blacks benefit from , " @entity86 said			0
many credited @entity1 's success at the ballot box to his ability to funnel federal dollars into his state -- the poorest in the country			1
@entity99 , who steered the @entity100 , said that @entity1 's long - standing relationships with the @entity21 - @entity21 community and ability to meet " the needs of all the @entity38 " helped @entity1 win			1
" it only worked because they had confidence in sen. @entity1 , whether it was a @entity3 voter we were talking to , an independent voter we were talking to , or even a @entity13 voter , " @entity99 acknowledged			1
but still , @entity99 said he does not " think there 's any question " that the strategy can be applied on a national level			0
" we 've got to genuinely go into the minority communities and communicate our message and explain to them why it 's good for them , " @entity99 said			1
@entity99 called the election an impressive feat given the state 's violent history of race relations			0
turnout spiked in @entity130 , which is 70 % african - american and saw about 7,000 more voters for @entity1 in the runoff than in the primary			1
while boasting a similar share of @entity1 supporters , neighboring @entity136 -- which is 38 % @entity21 -- delivered much smaller gains for @entity1 in the runoff			1
@entity138 , the mayor of @entity139 , backed @entity1 and encouraged other @entity13 to support him at the polls , largely because his city 's economy is anchored in government - funded projects			2
" ( sen. @entity1 ) is a person that demonstrates leadership in terms of helping with jobs and job creation , " @entity138 said			2
" i 'm a black @entity149 , but i try to be responsive to the needs of the city and the state			0
" he added that @entity38 would be unable to compete for federal funds with states like @entity155 or @entity156 without @entity1 's seniority in the @entity56			1
@entity99 said he was " damned proud " to ask african - americans and @entity13 for their support			0
" one of the highlights of the runoff was working with african - americans in a shared interest in our state , " @entity99 said			0
" this is how you grow the party			2
" conservative activists slam @entity1 for courting democrats is the @entity21 - @entity21 vote up for grabs ? @entity175 's @entity174 said the @entity38 race showed that neither party should take the black vote for granted			1
" we do n't go out and earn the black vote , " @entity179 said of the @entity3			2
" the only time the @entity3 is serious about going after the black vote is -- it 's like the vote of last resort			2
blacks have become the vote of last resort and we need to say no more			0
" republicans could actually make inroads with african - americans in the rural and suburban communities of the @entity189 , said @entity190 , a political science professor at @entity191			0
@entity190 , who has written extensively about race in politics , said @entity1 's outreach to blacks is " obviously a winning strategy " and that the runoff showed that there is interest in the @entity21 - @entity21 community to have an impact on the political process			1
" it 's not going to be a strategy that you 're going to throw away , " @entity190 said			0
he added that many african - americans are socially conservative and may find @entity3 candidates appealing , particularly if they can bring home federal dollars for the agriculture industry , which relies on subsidies			2
" democrats should not rest on their laurels and assume that the @entity21 - @entity21 vote is theirs and the @entity3 should not assume that it is out of their reach , " @entity190 said			1
@entity13 strategist and @entity25 political commentator @entity215 dispelled the idea that @entity13 take the @entity21 - @entity21 vote for granted and said that @entity13 are working to recruit and turn out more every election cycle			2
" the only legitimate criticism ... is that we wait until the last minute to encourage @entity221 - @entity21 to vote , " @entity215 said			0
" but when it comes to encouraging @entity221 - @entity21 to run for office , we 're at the table			0
" but @entity215 said the @entity225 is making an " aggressive effort " to recruit and register african - americans and other minorities in key states this cycle @entity225 national press secretary @entity231 said the group is already spending to raise turnout in battleground states to near - 2012 levels and will be " making an unprecedented investment " to keep the @entity56 in @entity13 hands			0
registering and turning out @entity21 will be a key part of this strategy , particularly in @entity240 , @entity241 and @entity242 , @entity231 said			0
forming a more inclusive party @entity244 , former chairman of the @entity245 , was wary to draw any broader conclusions from the unique @entity38 runoff , but said the race is a reminder the @entity3 needs to cast a wider net			1
" nationally , if we ever hope to win back the @entity253 , we need to have an approach that 's inclusive of every segment of society , " @entity244 , who is also president of @entity251 , said			0
" the poor of our country are not the problem , they 're the ones most in need of our solutions			0
" @entity244 suggested the @entity3 should show how its market - oriented solutions can empower all types of communities			2
" you just need to show up			0
you need to be willing to go to @entity269 bodegas , black churches or mosques , " he said			0
beyond african - americans , @entity3 will also need to draw @entity269 voters to remain a viable party as that population is projected to triple by 2050			2
@entity276 , chair of the @entity278 's political science department , called the runoff an " exceptional " case and said no one should expect any significant shifts in racial partisanship			0
but @entity1 's strategy of courting the @entity21 - @entity21 vote proved successful -- whether because of his record of funding projects in @entity38 or the fear of being represented by someone like @entity290			1
" anytime something works in politics , someone else will try to copy it , " @entity276 said			0
@entity290 says ' hundreds ' of irregularities found in @entity38 race @entity38 primary spending surge pushes advertisers off the air			0

runoff turnout shot up in counties with the highest @entity21 populations
" this is how you grow the party , " head of a @entity100 said
several @entity3 strategists said @entity1 's *coalition* was unique to @entity38
democrats targeting minority communities hoping to increase *midterm* turnout
