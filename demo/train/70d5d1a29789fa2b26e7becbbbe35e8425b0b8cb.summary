-- " terrorists use @entity2 to recruit new members			1
" @entity4 , " @entity6 's " senior correspondent , passionately made this argument as our first guest ever on the weekly @entity0 podcast " the @entity11			1
" @entity4 thinks it 's time to close @entity2 now -- and i could n't agree with him more			1
president @entity14 brought this issue back to the forefront when he renewed his call to close the prison facility			0
@entity14 explained at his press conference on tuesday : " it is critical for us to understand that @entity2 is not necessary to keep @entity22 safe			1
... it hurts us in terms of our international standing			0
it is a recruiting tool for extremists			0
" @entity4 echoed president @entity14 's sentiments that the @entity22 can not simply hold people indefinitely without affording them the opportunity to answer the charges against them			1
" why ca n't we try these prisoners in court ? we have done that with other terrorists like @entity37 , " @entity4 said			2
@entity4 , who appeared in the @entity39 play , " @entity2 , " and can be seen in the soon - to - be - released comedy film , " @entity40 , " spoke about his discussion with the father of a @entity2 detainee			1
the father made a simple plea to @entity4 : " try my son in court , and if you find him guilty of being a terrorist , execute him			2
if not , then let him go			0
" there are 166 prisoners in the prison			0
eighty - six of them have been cleared for release by our government but have still not been set free			0
many of these prisoners are on a hunger strike to protest their indefinite detention			0
in response , prison officials are force - feeding them by inserting tubes through their nasal passages , a practice that the @entity68 declared as torture			0
should the @entity22 government close @entity2 and put the prisoners not cleared for release on trial ? that 's the first issue in this week 's episode of " the @entity11 , " which features @entity0 contributors @entity75 , @entity77 and me			1
here is a brief summary of the big three issues we took on : 1			0
@entity2 -- close it now ? our guest , @entity4 , emphatically argued yes			1
@entity86 noted that more than 40 of the prisoners have been deemed too violent to ever be released			0
@entity77 expressed concerns that national security secrets could be released if these prisoners were tried in open court			2
is @entity91 , the @entity92 player who came out of the closet , the @entity94 of gay athletes ? while all three of us applauded @entity91 ' courage in coming out , we disagreed over its significance when compared to @entity94			1
@entity77 argued that @entity94 was far more important because racism was a much more polarizing issue at the time and also , @entity94 was a far superior athlete			2
we all agreed , though some of the criticism @entity91 received makes it clear the fight to end homophobia still has a long way to go			2
who will voters pick in the congressional special election in @entity112 next week ? @entity113 , a @entity115 former governor who famously cheated on his wife by sneaking off to @entity117 , or @entity118 , a liberal - ish @entity119 who is the sister of @entity123 's @entity122 ? @entity77 was the moderator of a recent debate between @entity113 and @entity125			1
some were shocked that @entity125 brought up @entity113 's past affair			1
in fact , i think it tells us a great deal about @entity113 's character			2
@entity77 argued that many have forgiven @entity135 for his escapades , why should n't @entity113 get a second chance ? @entity86 noted that the demographics of the district are becoming moderate , which can help @entity125 win the may 7 election			1
