only 10 % of countries carried out executions last year , but those employing the death penalty are doing so at an alarming rate , a new report says			1
according to @entity10 's annual review of death sentences and executions , the number of countries using capital punishment in 2011 was 20 , a decrease of more than a third compared to 10 years ago			1
some 18,750 people faced death sentences at the end of 2011 , while at least 676 people were executed across the world , the report said			1
people were sentenced to death for a range of offenses including adultery and sodomy in @entity24 , blasphemy in @entity26 and drug offenses in around 10 countries			0
@entity10 claims many of these cases would not have involved fair trials by international standards , and that " confessions " are often extracted through the use of torture and other methods of coercion			0
" the vast majority of countries have moved away from using the death penalty , " said @entity37 , secretary general of @entity10			0
" our message to the leaders of the isolated minority of countries that continue to execute is clear : you are out of step with the rest of the world on this issue and it is time you took steps to end this most cruel , inhuman and degrading punishment			0
" countries in the @entity56 recorded a steep rise in executions last year -- 50 % up compared to the previous year -- with @entity59 ( estimated to be 82 ) , @entity24 ( at least 360 ) , @entity60 ( at least 41 ) and @entity61 ( at least 68 ) responsible for 99 % of all recorded cases in the region			1
@entity10 added that the true extent of @entity24 's record was unknown due to a lack of credible official figures			0
likewise the report did not include what it described were " the thousands of executions that @entity10 believes were carried out in @entity71 , where the numbers are suppressed			2
" it claimed thousands of people were executed in @entity71 in 2011 , more than the rest of the world put together			1
the rights group says it has stopped publishing figures it collects from public sources in @entity71 , as " these are likely to grossly underestimate the true number			2
" @entity71 authorities could not be immediately reached for comment			0
meanwhile , the @entity85 was the only member of the @entity88 group of leading economies to execute prisoners -- 43 in 2011 , the report said			1
@entity91 and former @entity93 countries were " capital punishment - free , " apart from @entity94 where two people were executed last year			2
" even among the small group of countries that executed in 2011 , we can see gradual progress , " @entity37 added			2
" it is not going to happen overnight but we are determined that we will see the day when the death penalty is consigned to history			0
