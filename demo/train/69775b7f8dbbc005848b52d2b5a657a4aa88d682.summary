@entity0 -- the @entity3 is looking to @entity5 's rebel movement to decide whether @entity7 bomber @entity6 needs to return behind bars , the @entity2 said monday			1
@entity1 senior international correspondent @entity9 found @entity6 under the care of his family in his palatial @entity13 villa sunday , surviving on oxygen and an intravenous drip			1
the @entity17 government has come under fire in recent years for its decision to release @entity6 from prison in 2009 on the grounds that he had cancer and was not likely to live more than three months			1
" secretary ( @entity26 ) @entity25 has made clear , we believe ( @entity6 ) should still be behind bars , that the decision to release was not the right decision to make , " @entity2 spokeswoman @entity23 told reporters monday			1
she said the decision is now left to be made by the @entity5 rebel movement , the @entity32 -- now fighting to quash the last pockets of resistance			1
" we need to let them get their feet under themselves as a governing authority and then they have agreed that they will look at this , " @entity23 said			0
" we asked the ( @entity32 ) to , as soon as it can , take a hard look at what it thinks ought to happen with mr. @entity6 and it has committed to do that			1
" this is a new day in @entity5			2
this is a guy with blood on his hands , the lives of innocents			0
@entity5 itself under ( @entity52 ) @entity51 made a hero of this guy			2
presumably a new free democratic @entity5 would have a different attitude towards a convicted terrorist , " @entity23 added			2
" so it is in that spirit that the ( @entity32 ) will look at this case			0
i can not speak to what decisions will be made			0
" earlier monday , the @entity32 said there would be no decision made on @entity6 's fate until a newly elected government is established in the war - torn country			1
@entity68 was freed from a prison in @entity17 in 2009 after serving eight years of a life sentence for blowing up the @entity72 jet , killing all 259 on board and 11 in the town of @entity7 below			1
doctors who had been treating him for prostate cancer gave him just three months to live , and he was released on compassionate grounds			0
he received a hero 's welcome in @entity13 , enraging many in the @entity3 and @entity81			2
and with the rebel sweep into @entity13 in recent days , politicians on both sides of the @entity84 have called for @entity6 to be sent back to prison			1
but the @entity32 told @entity1 monday that the decision will be left to the future elected government of @entity5			1
the statement appeared to back away from comments made a day earlier by @entity32 justice minister @entity91 , who said the rebels would not allow him to be extradited : " we will not give any @entity5 citizen to the @entity94			1
" @entity95 , president of the executive bureau of the @entity32 , contacted @entity1 monday to clarify what @entity91 said			2
" what mr. @entity91 was talking about was about a legal point , " @entity95 told @entity1			2
" he was not talking about a policy or a position taken by the ( @entity32 )			0
so there is a misperception , a misinterpretation of the statement by mr. @entity91			0
" mr. @entity91 can not make a policy statement on behalf of the ( @entity32 ) or on behalf of the @entity5 people , " @entity95 added			2
" this will be left to the @entity5 people to decide in the future			0
the ( @entity32 ) is an interim body and it can not decide major issues			0
" he said " stability and order " in @entity5 is the top priority for the rebel movement			1
meanwhile , the @entity17 government monday took aim at critics of its decision to release the bomber			1
" as has always been said , @entity6 is dying of a terminal disease , " said the @entity17 government and the local council that monitors him since his release			1
" speculation about @entity6 in recent days has been unhelpful , unnecessary and indeed ill - informed , " the government and @entity128 said in a statement			1
the cancer - stricken former @entity5 intelligence officer may be the last man alive who knows precisely who in the @entity5 government authorized the 1988 bombing			1
@entity68 has lived far longer than expected			0
he made a public appearance with now - fugitive @entity5 strongman @entity51 in july , confined to a wheelchair			0
he has maintained his innocence			0
with the rebels holding control of many parts of @entity13 , his care has been left up to his son and his mother			2
" we just give him oxygen			0
nobody gives us any advice , " his son , @entity147 , told @entity1			0
" there is no doctor			0
there is nobody to ask			0
we do n't have any phone line to call anybody			0

rebel movement should " take a hard look " at @entity68 , @entity2 says
release of @entity6 will be up to elected @entity5 government , rebels say
@entity17 authorities hit back at critics of the release
@entity1 tracks @entity68 to his @entity13 villa
