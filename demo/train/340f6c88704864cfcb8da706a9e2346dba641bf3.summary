more than 3,500 pages of previously secret @entity3 documents made public friday showed that the more things change , the more they stay the same			1
highlights from the @entity7 documents do your own review with the @entity11 document reader some of the confidential memos , notes and other papers released by the @entity15 referred to technological advances of the times , such as the 1995 memo that suggested then first lady @entity19 use the @entity20 to speak to young women because it " has become very popular			1
" others detailed political battles over health care reform that sounded like today 's headlines			1
" the @entity28 alternative , as it appears now to be shaping up , at least among the moderate @entity28 in the @entity29 , is an individual mandate , we have looked at that in every way we know how to , " said @entity19 's notes from a 1993 meeting with @entity36 leaders in @entity37			1
" that is politically and substantively a much harder sell than the one we 've got -- a much harder sell			0
" health care wars of old we now know that the @entity7 plan for employers to provide health coverage for workers failed to pass back then , and the individual mandate -- requiring people to obtain health insurance -- is the foundation of the 2010 @entity53 reforms passed by the @entity36 - controlled @entity37 with zero @entity28 votes			1
from the same meeting with congressional democrats , @entity7 wrote that " it may be an unpleasant fact for some of us @entity36 to face , but the argument is not going to ( be ) won on bringing in the uninsured			1
" president @entity61 and @entity36 now face relentless criticism from @entity28 over changes in policies and costs forced on some consumers by the 2010 reforms , rather than the requirement that the previously uninsured get coverage			0
@entity7 's words from two decades ago now sound prescient			2
" the argument is going to be won , " she wrote , on keeping coverage " for everybody , including those who are insured , but may not be next year or the year after			0
" in another memo from 1994 , an aide to president @entity7 warned against using a line in the upcoming @entity80 address about his administration 's health care proposal that said : " you 'll pick the health plan and the doctor of your choice			1
" " this sounds great and i know that it 's just what people want to hear , but can we get away with it ? " wrote @entity90 @entity89			0
noting that the thrust of the @entity7 reforms was to steer people toward " cheaper , hmo - style providers , " @entity89 added that he worried about " getting skewered for overpromising here on something we know full well we wo n't deliver			2
" today , @entity61 gets skewered for similar claims he made during the health care debate 15 years later that turned out to be exaggerated or plain wrong , such as his " if you like your health care plan , you can keep it " statement that earned him " @entity107 " by the fact - checking website @entity110			1
@entity7 ok with @entity53 fixes @entity19 , the overwhelming favorite for the @entity36 presidential nomination in 2016 , faces no apparent bombshells from the 3,546 pages of archival documents made public friday			1
can @entity7 tap @entity61 's magic in @entity120 ? it was the first batch of more than 30,000 pages eligible for release after a 12 - year waiting period under the @entity125 , with more to be made public in march			1
first digital age presidential candidate " so far , and underlining so far because we 're still going through the documents , absolutely nothing " amounting to a game - changer for @entity7 , said @entity11 chief national correspondent @entity128			1
at the same time , he noted @entity7 would be the first presidential candidate of the digital age with still unpublicized documentation dating back to her eight years in the @entity137 as first lady			1
" there 's never been a candidate that we think we know so well , but yet there 's this huge resource of information where we still might learn things , " @entity128 said			0
the new documents showed a first lady pushed by her aides to be more open and accessible to the public			2
in the 1995 memo by press secretary @entity153 , suggestions included a guest appearance on the @entity156 tv show " @entity158 " and using the then - young @entity20 to connect to young women , noting that " @entity20 has become a very popular mode of communication			0
" four years later , adviser @entity161 offered " style pointers " in a memo for listening tour @entity7 did after creating an exploratory committee for her @entity29 campaign in @entity166			2
" do n't be defensive			0
look like you want the questions			0
the press is obviously watching to see if they can make you uncomfortable or testy			0
even on the annoying questions , give relaxed answers , " @entity161 wrote			0
she also added that @entity7 should " look for opportunities for humor " because " it 's important that people see more sides of you , and they often see you only in very stern situations			2
" adviser in 1999 : try to be funny @entity161 also advised @entity7 to avoid laying claim on the record of her husband 's administration , saying " this trip is about you , and you are not an incumbent			2
" one more tip from @entity192 : be prepared to be asked if she ever used drugs			0
with the potential for politically volatile details in the documents , groups trying to bolster or harm @entity7 's possible presidential ambitions made clear they would be having a look			1
@entity200 , a pro-republican opposition research shop , told @entity11 that " we 'll be poring through them , " with a person on ground in @entity204 for that purpose			0
rubio on 2016 : @entity7 would ' struggle ' @entity206 , a @entity207 group with deep ties to the @entity7 family , also told @entity11 it would have a team going over the new information			1
dem groups already at work for 2016 heavy demand appeared to disable the website of the @entity216 for some users in the first minutes after the documents were released on friday afternoon			1
in total , approximately 25,000 pages of new documents , including confidential communications between president @entity7 and his top advisers , will be released over the next two weeks			1
under the @entity125 , they became eligible for release in january 2013 , 12 years after @entity7 's presidency ended			2
" when those restrictions expired , ( the @entity15 ) then provided notification of our intent to disclose these @entity125 records to the representatives of president @entity61 and former president clinton in accordance with executive order 13489 , so that they may conduct a privilege review of the records , " the @entity15 said in a written statement			0
" as they complete their review , @entity15 is able to make the records available			0
" more documents coming an additional 8,000 pages are undergoing a further month - long review per a directive from the @entity137 and will not be available for release prior to march 26			2
the documents in question were part of files that had been requested for public release over the years under the @entity250 , but were withheld due to their sensitive nature			2
while the @entity125 established public ownership of @entity137 documents as far back as the @entity255 , it defined six categories of records that could be withheld for the 12 - year period			2
they include classified national security information , confidential business information and trade secrets , and unwarranted invasions of personal privacy			0
documents pertaining to federal appointments and confidential communications , so - called " @entity270 " and " @entity269 " exemptions , also fall under the 12 - year protection of the act			0
after the 12 - year mark from the end of a presidential administration , the records are subject to the same restrictions as spelled out in the @entity250 , with one key exception			0
@entity37 excluded presidential records from exemptions based on executive privilege			0
however , since the passage of the law , presidents @entity282 , @entity284 and @entity61 have each issued executive orders clarifying the process under which an incumbent president or former president could assert executive privilege to prevent the release of documents			0
the new releases will not be the first from the @entity7 archives			0
the library routinely releases records in response to @entity250 requests , although a sizable backlog exists			0
@entity250 requests records were also released during the @entity305 nomination of @entity306 , who worked as a @entity137 lawyer during the @entity7 administration , and also as a result of ongoing legal action from the conservative group @entity312			1
interest in the often unglamorous world of archival research has spiked due to the possible presidential candidacy of @entity19 , a former @entity317 senator from @entity166 and secretary of state in @entity61 's first term			1
earlier this month , @entity11 reviewed papers from a former confidante of the @entity322 , @entity321 , that offered some revealing personal glimpses of @entity19 during her years as first lady			1
@entity325 was counselor , friend for @entity19 @entity11 document reader : read from the @entity325 papers			1
