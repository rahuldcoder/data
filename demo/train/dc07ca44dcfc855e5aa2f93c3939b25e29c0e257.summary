@entity0 -- here is an unlikely duel : it 's @entity5 , former @entity6 governor and possible 2016 @entity8 presidential hopeful , vs. @entity9 , actor and activist			1
the topic : school accountability measures that rely on high - stakes testing to determine which students are learning , which educators are teaching and which schools are working			2
@entity5 supports the tests , @entity9 opposes them			1
more on how their paths crossed in a minute			0
first , take it from someone who taught for four years as a substitute teacher in my old school district in @entity26 and who has written about education reform for more than two decades : many educators do n't want to advertise to the world how well their students are doing academically because , from there , it 's a short walk to grading teacher performance			2
that is what accountability is all about			0
you probably have it in your job			0
i have it in mine			0
but a lot of public school teachers want nothing to do with it			0
accountability includes the @entity48 law , which set forth the radical proposition that all students should be at grade level in math and reading by 2014			0
the law also broke down testing data according to race and ethnicity , so minority communities could see how well the public schools in their neighborhoods are serving their @entity62 enter @entity9 , whose mother , @entity64 - @entity63 , is a professor of early childhood education at @entity66 in @entity67			1
@entity9 is himself a product of public schools , a fact that he eagerly shared with the crowd of teachers that he addressed in @entity74 in july 2011 as part of a protest called " @entity77			1
" the protesters had gathered because they were upset with the @entity80 administration , which has picked up the mantle of high - stakes testing from its predecessor through its own education reform initiative , " @entity87			2
" in his remarks , @entity9 looked back fondly on his own educational experience while criticizing high - stakes testing and other school accountability measures			1
" as i look at my life today , " he told the crowd , " the things i value most about myself -- my imagination , my love of acting , my passion for writing , my love of learning , my curiosity -- all come from how i was parented and taught			0
and none of these qualities that i 've just mentioned -- none of these qualities that i prize so deeply , that have brought me so much joy , that have brought me so much professional success -- none of these qualities that make me who i am ... can be tested			0
more recently , @entity9 -- who grew up in the @entity67 area but now lives in the @entity115 area -- has opened a can of worms by recently revealing to the @entity118 newspaper that , his love for the public schools notwithstanding , he made other arrangements for his own kids			1
" sending our kids in my family to private school was a big , big , big deal , " @entity9 said in the interview			1
" and it was a giant family discussion			0
but it was a circular conversation , really , because ultimately we do n't have a choice			0
i mean , i pay for a private education , and i 'm trying to get the one that most matches the public education that i had , but that kind of progressive education no longer exists in the public system			1
" the public schools are not progressive enough ? in @entity115 ? really ? so despite his fondness for public schools , the 42 - year - old actor does n't want his children anywhere near them			1
this caught the attention of @entity5 , who last week took to @entity147 to denounce @entity9 's hypocrisy			1
@entity5 ( @entity149 ) tweeted : " @entity9 refuses to enroll kids in @entity151			1
choice ok for @entity9 , why not everyone else ? " fair ? you bet			2
@entity9 has long been a cheerleader for the public schools , and so the actor deserved this spanking for his self - serving " good enough for thee , but not for me " defense of a public school system that he and his own family have abandoned			1
others have said the same thing			0
yet now it is @entity5 's turn to get spanked			2
the liberal media is already -- surprise -- attacking the @entity8 presidential contender in defense of the @entity172 celebrity			0
some have even pointed out that @entity5 also sent his kids to private school and insisted that this makes the @entity8 the real hypocrite			2
@entity5 supports school choice and he practiced in his own family			2
where 's the inconsistency ? the real issue in this story is n't the personalities			0
it was not smart of @entity9 to attack high - stakes testing -- especially since his own kids , because they attend private school , do n't have to worry about how bad some of our public schools would be without the accountability measures that their daddy opposes so vehemently			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity197 .			0

@entity197 : testing is *controversial* but provides needed accountabiity in schools
@entity9 , a proud graduate of public schools , questioned *emphasis* on testing
@entity9 said he did n't send his kids to public schools as they lack " progressive education "
@entity197 : @entity5 was right to call out @entity9 for not living up to his ideals
