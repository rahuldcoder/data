@entity0 -- covering the trial of @entity3 , a man once tipped to rise to the summit of @entity6 politics , reminded me of the time i reported on a similarly explosive story in the early 1980s -- the trial of the so - called " @entity11 " in @entity6			1
this notorious group was led by @entity13 , @entity15 's widow , and three of her ideological allies			1
a former movie starlet , @entity13 rose to the top tier of the @entity21 leadership thanks mainly to her close ties with the " @entity23 , " the architect of the infamous @entity25 , a campaign to enforce @entity26 that led to the persecution of millions of people			1
but a month after chairman @entity15 's death in 1976 , the four , together with their associates , were arrested and charged with " heinous " crimes , including plotting to assassinate @entity15 and attempting to pull off an armed rebellion			1
it took more than four years to bring them to trial			0
for @entity6 watchers , it was worth the wait			2
it turned out to be @entity6 's " trial of the century , " replete with political intrigue , drama and endlessly memorable quotes			1
" attacking the @entity50 , " read the headline of one of our @entity48 magazine stories published in january 1981			0
it was the first major story i covered as a foreign correspondent in @entity6			2
controlled coverage " @entity56 " is a misnomer			0
more than 600 people -- mostly government officials , representatives from the public , relatives of defendants and trusted @entity6 reporters -- were allowed in court , by invitation only			1
foreign journalists like me need not apply , i was told			0
nevertheless the trial turned into a huge story , covered extensively in and outside @entity6			1
at that stage , @entity6 was just emerging from the dark clouds of the totalitarian @entity72 era			2
the political system was opaque and the media was severely controlled			0
to our surprise , however , the @entity6 newspapers , radio and tv were saturated with " gavel to gavel " reports , as a fellow reporter put it			2
the trial dragged on for nearly two months			0
we relied largely on officially vetted accounts and rare tv footage , aware the authorities had allowed extensive but filtered coverage not for the sake of transparency but to demonize the defendants and legitimize their incarceration			0
i remember spending many nights watching @entity95 's extensive excerpts of the court proceedings with @entity6 friends and fellow reporters			1
we spent as much time parsing what actually took place inside the courtroom , then reached out to unofficial sources to find out what was actually left out of the official narrative			0
much like events in @entity107 this week , the @entity11 trial took a melodramatic turn as it winded down			1
during the televised coverage , the former actress feistily defended herself against charges of treason by claiming that everything she did had @entity15 's approval			1
" i was chairman @entity15 's dog , " @entity13 shouted at the panel of judges			1
" whomever he told me to bite , i bit			0
" in her final speech , that lasted for about two hours , the 66 year old said she was " prepared to die " fighting for her husband and leader			0
in early 1981 , @entity15 , as she became known , was sentenced to death with a two - year reprieve , later commuted to life imprisonment			1
but several years later , she committed suicide while under house arrest			0
transparent or not ? watching the @entity3 trial this week , i wondered what has changed and what has not since @entity13 's trial three decades ago			1
" this was an open process for @entity6 , giving @entity3 the chance to challenge his accusers and present his own case so publicly , " said @entity132 , a professor at the @entity133			1
" it has been great drama			0
this is no @entity141 trial			0
" true , the five - day trial turned out to be more interesting and substantive			2
i had expected a brief and heavily scripted political " show trial			2
" but @entity3 the accused was given ample time to speak out and cross-examine adversarial witnesses			1
for that @entity3 himself credited and thanked court officials , especially the chief judge			1
" the judge is a professional with a law degree , not like ( @entity11 trial chief judge ) @entity154 , who was a @entity156 - era cadre , " said @entity6 film producer @entity150			1
" also , @entity3 had defense lawyers , who i understand were picked by @entity3 and his family			2
this could not have happened during the trial of the @entity11			1
" the @entity6 authorities hailed this as an " open and public trial , " posting photos , video clips and excerpts from court transcripts on the court 's @entity170 - like @entity169 account			1
" it 's a major breakthrough , " claimed political analyst @entity172			0
" it demonstrates the government 's eagerness to show they have nothing to hide from the public about the trial			2
it helps enhance transparency and may bode well for greater political reform and judiciary reform			0
" filtered truth but other observers say the court proceeding was only partially open , noting that the court 's micro-blog was tightly vetted			0
" i think we are clearly still getting a filtered truth , " said @entity189 , a professor at the @entity190 in the @entity191			0
" the @entity169 transcripts are not complete			0
" @entity189 noted that the transcripts released on the first day were more copious than those released on the second and subsequent days			0
" so it seems like somebody somewhere decided to release less information , " he explained			0
" it is inconceivable to me that somebody pretty senior in the propaganda apparatus is not making decisions about what to put in the publicly released transcripts			0
" with only 19 " trusted " @entity6 journalists allowed into the courtroom , we again had to seek out other sources of information to fill in the blanks and cross-check the court 's micro-blogs			1
the official narrative left out parts that may put @entity3 in good light , two people with knowledge of the proceedings told @entity1			2
at the closing session on monday , sources said , @entity3 spoke for nearly half an hour , much longer than the court transcripts suggested			2
@entity3 explained he was retracting his signed confessions because he made them under " severe pressure " during the 17 months he was detained and repeatedly interrogated			2
after he spoke , @entity3 's five family members stood up , clapping and saying : " well put , @entity3 ! we will always stand by you			1
" while we could not get the whole truth from the micro-blog , @entity150 suggested the trial offered some hope			0
" we could get a sense of what was going on inside the courtroom , especially when @entity3 said ' no ' to some of the charges in front of the judge and his relatives			2
" business as usual yet some things have not changed , even with the significant progress @entity6 has made in reforming its legal system in recent years			1
in 1981 , for instance , the @entity6 court nonchalantly billed the landmark judicial process as " @entity246 of @entity247 and @entity248 " -- pronouncing the defendants guilty of " counter-revolution " even before the trial			1
three decades later today , there is still no presumption of innocence at a trial			0
holding a trial typically presumes guilt , because a preliminary investigation is supposed to have already determined that before going to trial			0
in @entity3 's case , observers say president @entity263 's new administration will be treading carefully			1
" they want to win the case whereby @entity3 will be disgraced for the rest of his life so that he will never have a realistic chance to make a political comeback , " said @entity172			2
" but they see no incentive in having ' blood ' on their hands			0
they just want a quick and effective way to dispose of this case and turn a new page			0
" the court is expected to hand down a guilty verdict			0
" leniency to those who confess , severity to those who resist , " goes the guiding principle of @entity6 's socialist legal system			1
given @entity3 's defiance and refusal to confess , it seems the only question worth pondering is about how severe the sentence will be .			1

the so - called " @entity11 " was led by @entity13 , @entity15 's widow
they were accused of plotting to kill @entity15 and pull off a rebellion
the trial was widely reported but heavily censored by @entity6 officials
recent @entity3 trial was hailed for its transparency , though some question this
