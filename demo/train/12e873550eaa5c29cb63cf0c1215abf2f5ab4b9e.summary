and we want to work with @entity38 , with other countries , with everybody available to make sure this is peaceful from this day forward			1

at the same session , parliament voted to ask the @entity59 in the @entity60 to investigate the " illegal actions of the main members of the government " -- including @entity57			1
but the @entity59 public affairs unit said in an e-mail that it had received no communication regarding @entity1 and that the @entity59 has no jurisdiction over that country , because it is not a state party to the @entity70 , the court 's founding treaty			1
in addition , it said , a state can not ask the @entity59 to investigate specific individuals			0

those now in power in the capital face a raft of challenges : the division between the country 's east and west ; protesters eager for bigger changes in government ; an economy riddled with corruption ; and how to handle the intentions of @entity38 , a vital supplier of natural gas and a key backer of @entity57			1
' we were trapped ' : eyewitness to massacre in @entity0 leadership change the head of @entity1 's electoral commission , @entity144 , said the campaign to elect a new president would begin tuesday , three months before the may 25 election date set by authorities			1

" a course has been set for suppressing those who disagree in different regions of @entity1 with methods of dictatorship and terror , " the @entity150 said			2
@entity38 -- which pried @entity1 away from the @entity166 with a $ 15 billion loan in november -- has withdrawn that offer , and president @entity170 's role in the formation of a new government was uncertain			1
@entity38 contends that @entity57 was driven out by an " armed mutiny " of extremists and terrorists			2
" we have not only the internal enemies , but we have the external enemies , like @entity38 , " member of parliament @entity179 told @entity2 's @entity180 on tuesday from @entity0			1
" we are afraid of military intervention , and @entity170 is trying to find a pretext for that			1

" we have to make unpopular steps , and we have to have this government taking those steps , " @entity179 said			2
" not just to have financial aid , but to have the plan of reforms to get outside of this economic crisis			0
" " this is not just the issue of @entity1			2
this is the issue of the whole region 's stability			0
" winners and losers east - west divide @entity57 's decision to scrap a @entity166 trade deal in favor of one with @entity38 prompted the protests , which began in november			1

" the relationship is not always developing in constructive ways			0
we have confirmed our position of not intervening in @entity1 politics , " he said			2
" we hope all channels will be used to calm the situation in @entity1			2
" @entity248 said @entity38 was working with @entity166 officials in @entity259 , @entity260			1
" it is not a good position to impose to @entity1 that ' either you are with us or without us			2
' but we hope it will become our full partner in the near future , " he added			0
@entity269 president @entity268 appealed tuesday " to all our international partners , in particular @entity38 , to work constructively with us to guarantee a united @entity1 that can be a factor for stability in the @entity218 continent ; a @entity1 that will have good relations both with its western as with its eastern partners			1
" ' people want to be united ' @entity57 's base of support is in eastern @entity1 , where @entity38 culture and language predominate and where many people are suspicious of the @entity218 - leaning views of their counterparts in western @entity1 , who were at the heart of the protests against @entity57 that filled central @entity0 for months			1
