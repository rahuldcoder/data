-- for video game fans , many of the gadgets and accessories designed to support today 's games are as unique and imaginative as the games themselves			1
from inflatable @entity10 racing karts to @entity12 joysticks and plastic assault rifles tailor - made for living room juntas , there 's no shortage of weird , wild and occasionally even useful peripherals for handheld and set - top systems alike			1
among the hundreds of available gaming gizmos and add - ons are a coffin - shaped guitar instrument case and blinged - out chrome plating for consoles			1
they 're great to look at , but they wo n't enhance your gameplay much			2
here are five recent accessories designed to improve your gaming experience : @entity30 ( $ 299.99 , http://www.projectgaems.com / ) -- a portable game room to go , this carrying case unpacks to reveal a built - in 15.5 - inch @entity34 screen , stereo speakers and dual 3.5mm headphone jacks that let you annihilate friends or save the universe anywhere you travel			1
pop an @entity41 or @entity40 in , hook up the hdmi cable , and assuming you do n't mind a little heavy lifting , voila			0
you can spend family vacations with your head happily buried in " @entity47 " or " @entity48			0
" @entity49 ( $ 159.99 , www.madcatz.com ) -- pricey , but infinitely cheaper than springing for an arcade machine , this @entity51 and @entity41 joystick controller and eight - button pad delivers authentic coin - operated control and precision			2
designed for use with popular fighting games such as " @entity60 , " it lets you plug in its 13 - foot usb connector cable to enjoy customizable button mappings , turbo functionality and that classic quarter - munching feel			2
@entity65 for @entity66 ( $ 29.99 , www.nyko.com ) -- given the @entity66 handheld @entity73 gaming system 's anemic 3 - to 4 - hour battery life , this useful combo charging dock and capacity - boosting rechargeable battery comes in especially handy by offering double the juice			1
it 's not the most convenient accessory to carry around			0
but if you 're planning on marathon play sessions , it can keep you happily splattering aliens or downing submarines twice as long as usual			0
@entity83 ( $ 39.99 ) -- this plastic attachment lets you turn your @entity86 motion controller into a full - fledged rifle , theoretically providing greater accuracy and atmosphere in shooter games like the suddenly timely " @entity91 : @entity92			0
" go ahead -- screw up your face and do your best " @entity95 " impression			0
there 's no denying the temptation to want to place your fingers on its pump - action grip			1
@entity101 : road trip with @entity103 ( $ 29.99 , www.eagl3.com ) -- of all the goofy gewgaws ( e.g. plastic sword , shield , fishing rod , machine gun and jet - ski inserts ) offered for @entity10 and @entity40 , we 're partial to these motorcycle handlebars from @entity112 crank up " @entity115 , " twist the wii remote to rev up , and you too can join the ranks of balding middle managers who spend their sundays hitting the road on their virtual hog -- while reclining in a well - worn @entity123 .			0
