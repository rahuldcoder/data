is it or is n't it a planet ? ever since astronomer @entity6 at the @entity7 in @entity8 , @entity9 , discovered it on february 18 , 1930 , we 've believed that we live in a solar system with nine planets			2
then , along came the @entity13 , the group that gets to name planetary bodies			0
in 2006 , it came up with some rules for what is and is not a planet			1
the group decided @entity1 did n't make the grade			1
it was demoted to a dwarf planet , leaving our solar system with just eight planets : @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29			1
the union says a planet is a celestial body ( @entity33 ) that : 1			2
is round or nearly round 3			0
has cleared the neighborhood around its orbit @entity1 orbits the sun , and it 's round			1
it got kicked out as a planet because of rule no. 3 : the astronomical union said @entity1 was too small to knock other space rocks out of its path as it orbits the sun. but the group 's definitions -- and the public 's attachment to tiny @entity1 -- sparked lots of debate			1
on september 18 , the @entity53 jumped into the debate : what is a planet ? it had some experts discuss the definition of a planet and then let the audience vote			1
guess what ? they voted that @entity1 is a planet			1
one person who never accepted @entity1 's demotion is @entity66 , principal investigator for the @entity68 spacecraft , the first spacecraft sent to @entity1			1
he said @entity1 was given the boot because of its distance from the sun. " in fact , if you put @entity24 where @entity1 is , it would be excluded ! " @entity66 said			2
" any definition of planethood that excludes @entity24 , in any circumstance , is deeply flawed			0
after all , if there is any object everyone agrees is a planet , it 's @entity24			2
" and he agrees with those in the audience at that @entity53 panel discussion			2
" i think the public is better suited to this than astronomers , at least , " @entity66 said			0
" the @entity13 should never have pretended to have the expertise to enter into this debate			0
it 's a matter for planetary scientists , not astronomers			0
" do n't forget that the other eight planets also have their differences : @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25 are rocky ; @entity26 and @entity27 are gas giants ; and @entity28 and @entity29 are ice giants			0
" this is really about a revolution in planetary science , " @entity66 said			0
" we 're seeing that what we used to know about the number and variety of planets was very data limited until the mid- to late 1990s			0
now we know that there are lots of types of planets			0
" @entity113 's decades - old @entity112 mission is a preview of new mission to @entity1 when @entity68 arrives at @entity1 in july , it might not end the debate over @entity1 's status as a planet , but @entity66 says the mission is " going to be mind - blowing			1
" the spacecraft has to survive what @entity66 calls the " seven weeks of suspense , " dodging asteroids as it zips toward @entity1			2
then , we 'll finally get detailed , amazing photos of the tiny world			0
planet or not , @entity1 is finally coming into focus .			1

@entity1 was demoted to dwarf planet in 2006
@entity53 held a forum to debate @entity1 's status
the public says @entity1 should be *reinstated*
