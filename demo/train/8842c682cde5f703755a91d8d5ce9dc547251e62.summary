in the afternoon , @entity2 coached wrestling			1
at night , he treated himself to training in his true passion : mixed martial arts			1

while @entity22 fighters might not bring in the reported millions per bout that heavyweight boxers such as @entity129 versus @entity130 saw last month , how much they earn depends on who they are and what stage of their career they are in , @entity77 says			0

@entity2 says he finds his training schedule less tough than plumbing			1
he generally has two or three daily practices , each around two hours			0
that covers everything from strength training and conditioning to boxing and jiu - jitsu			0
