-- " it 's been a magical adventure , and this is a fantastic conclusion			0
" not many people get second chances in life , but @entity7 is making the most of his			1
in 2001 the ex-formula one driver was at death 's door , lucky to survive a horrific accident that left him with only 30 % of his blood supply			1
he lost both his legs -- amputated at the knee -- after being pulled from the wreckage of his car at a race in @entity22			1
fast forward more than a decade , to another race track , and the @entity24 is on top of the world			1
while he was never able to reach the heights of success in @entity29 -- @entity7 never made the podium in 44 races -- he is a champion paralympian			1
" i 'm somebody very lucky who had a great life , " the the 45 - year - old @entity7 said after winning gold in his adopted sport of hand cycling at @entity37 's @entity36 circuit on wednesday			1
" i have n't wasted many opportunities that fate gave me			2
i 've certainly had many more opportunities than i deserved , but luckily enough i ended up making the right choices			0
" from disaster to triumph : a week in the life of @entity48 in the buildup to the @entity50 , @entity7 joked , with a dose of black humor , that his accident " was how i won my ticket to the 2012 paralympics			1
" having failed to make a career in @entity29 after four difficult seasons , he turned to the @entity61 @entity60 series where he twice won the drivers ' title for @entity65 's team			2
that earned him a return to the elite division of motorsport in 1999 with the @entity71 team , but again he struggled			2
drifting back to open - wheel cars , fate came calling at the @entity74 on september 15 , 2001			1
he had worked his way up from the rear of the field to lead the race with 13 laps to go before that life - changing crash			1
given the severity of his injuries , the doctors at the scene of the accident said @entity7 should never have survived			1
remarkably just two months later , he was walking again using prosthetic legs of his own design			2
another two years on , he finished the race that nearly took his life , completing the remaining 13 laps at @entity91 in a specially modified touring car			2
by 2004 he was racing touring cars fulltime with the help of hand - operated brake and accelerator paddles			1
@entity7 even drove a modified @entity98 @entity29 car in 2006			1
@entity100 amputees bring message of hope : ' we are superstars ' but while most motorsport stars find it difficult to give up their high - octane thrills , @entity7 did just that			1
" three years ago i decided to stop motor racing , not because i had to but because i wanted to , " he said			2
" it looked stupid , because at the age of 42 to dump everything to try to pursue an objective to qualify for the @entity50 seemed to be against all odds for a man of my age			0
" it felt very crazy but it 's not the first crazy thing that i do in my life , so i guess it will not be the last			0
" @entity7 replaced one adrenaline buzz with another			1
he discovered hand cycling -- a sport where the bikes are powered by the riders ' arms -- at the 2007 @entity126			1
invited to speak as a guest , @entity7 decided if he was going to fly all the way from @entity24 to the @entity61 he might as well compete			1
compete he did , finishing fourth after only a few weeks ' training			0
he had found his new passion , competing in the 2009 world championships and then setting about qualifying for the 2012 paralympics			0
" this was the horizon , " he said , smiling as a burst of brilliant , afternoon sunshine lit up his face following his victory in the @entity138 classification road time trial			0
" i 'm very , very happy			0
it 's never been a sacrifice			0
i 've enjoyed every day of training as much as this moment now			0
" @entity143 sailing : a tale of triumph and technology immediately after his win , the @entity29 family -- including former world champions @entity148 and @entity150 -- took to social media sites to congratulate @entity7			2
although he was only briefly in their ranks , he is still remembered as one of the sport 's " nice guys " and most charismatic competitors			0
the golden ending to his journey came at @entity36 , a circuit 20 miles from @entity162 where @entity7 had previously raced in a touring car			1
" with an engine pushing me i did n't realize it was that hilly , " he said			0
" it 's very , very hard but if i had to design the course for the @entity50 this is what i would have done			0
it 's absolutely beautiful , it 's very hard -- i guess it really suits my characteristics as an old man			0
" so how does the thrill of winning a cycling race compare to the highs of motor racing ? " when you are in your twenties you just think the races are what matter the most , " @entity7 said			1
" when you are in your forties you really appreciate what you do every day			0
of course today is very important but i really appreciate what i did in the past			0
" @entity187 , it 's been magical , a magical adventure and this is a fantastic conclusion			0
" it seems unlikely that a man who could not be bowed by losing both of his legs will retire from sport anytime soon			0
he has already mooted a possible return at the 2016 @entity194 , but @entity7 also joked that his next plan was to add another wheel and engine to his cycle and come back to @entity36			2
the circuit also hosts superbike racing and , judging by the glint in his eye , perhaps @entity7 is already weighing up a new challenge of trying out a faster form of wheeled sport .			2
