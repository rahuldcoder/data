-- as protests sweep through @entity2 , a handful of web sites -- @entity5 , @entity6 , and @entity7 in particular -- are once again widely credited for their crucial role in the process			1
but before we swallow yet another dose of cyber-utopianism , a more critical look at how the @entity14 has abetted both sides is in order			0
the current protests very well may be a @entity5 revolution , but only future historians would be able to say so conclusively			2
at the moment we simply do not know if @entity5 and @entity6 have helped boost the turnout at demonstrations			1
@entity2 - related discussions on the @entity14 have undeniably spiked , but it 's impossible to tell how such messages , many written by foreign observers , influence @entity2 ' eagerness to risk their lives in the streets of @entity30 or @entity31			1
moreover , virtually all recent protests in @entity2 have been tied to some important political , religious or historical occasion			2
for example , people turning out for two symbolic anniversaries on november 4 , the religious holiday of @entity35 and the death of @entity37 , were not spontaneous outbursts organized and publicized by the @entity42			0
such protests would have been well - attended even if the @entity14 did not exist			0
this is not to deny that both @entity5 and @entity6 have played an important role in publicizing videos and photos of police brutality , most of them snapped and distributed with mobile phones			1
extraordinary as they are , we should not overestimate the usefulness of such materials			0
the @entity2 regime has proved remarkably immune to getting a bad rap in the international press , not to mention the @entity59			2
given the formidable risks that @entity2 's " citizen journalists " go through to record such videos , we in the @entity62 should be more cautious in encouraging them to capture the zeitgeist of the barricades			1
also , in the absence of independent review by professional reporters working on the ground -- and those who were banned from @entity2 a long time ago -- many videos have to carry a host of disclaimers			1
fake clips , usually made to provoke and split the opposition , are becoming a staple of the @entity2 internet			1
one such video , which portrayed someone burning a poster of the country 's supreme leader @entity82 before a crowd of cheering people , circulated on foreign and @entity2 web sites in early december			1
luckily , closer examination by @entity2 and foreign bloggers showed that it was probably a skillful montage			2
but can thousands of similar videos be fact - checked as thoroughly ? the proliferation of fake videos suggests that the @entity2 government may , directly or indirectly , benefit from using digital space for propaganda			1
even @entity5 could become a potent tool of brainwashing : in early july , @entity97 reported that after two weeks of protests the number of pro-government messages on @entity5 increased 200-fold compared with the period immediately after the election			2
flooding @entity5 with fake and pro-government updates is one way to make @entity5 unusable for the @entity107 audiences			2
how , after all , should we know what updates we can trust , if many of them are written by the government and its loyalists ? it turns the internet into the " @entity117			0
" that propaganda is displacing censorship as a primary means of controlling the @entity14 is quite remarkable			0
in the past , the @entity2 government would have simply blocked access to dissenting sites			2
but blocking @entity5 is impractical : not only would it be very expensive , but it would also disconnect the @entity2 secret police from a valuable channel of gathering intelligence			1
such intelligence reports come in very handy when protests fizzle out and repressions commence			0
the very first wave of post-election protests in the summer of 2009 left the @entity2 authorities with a massive log of anti-government messages , all stored on @entity5 and @entity6 for posterity to process , analyze and act upon			1
what many cheerleaders of @entity2 's @entity5 revolution fail to understand is that the easy availability of such information allows the regime to explore how various anti-government activists are connected to each other and to their foreign supporters			1
all it takes is looking up their @entity6 profiles			0
it 's hardly surprising , then , that many @entity2 - @entity148 traveling to @entity2 after the summer protests complained they were asked if they had @entity6 accounts			1
passport control officials at @entity30 's @entity152 even forced some of them log into them			0
but even those @entity2 abroad who did not travel anywhere and stayed at home complained of being harassed about their online activism			0
one could only guess what fate awaits those who stayed in the country			0
making our way through billions of @entity5 and @entity6 updates , we should not lose sight of one critical feature of the digital age : the wealth of information trails generated by digital activists has also provided authoritarian governments with better means to identify and squash emerging threats to their hegemony			1
even if the @entity2 protests eventually succeed , it will be thanks to a combination of political , social and religious factors			0
putting all our chips on information technology alone can have catastrophic consequences for the future of democracy in that country			0
the opinions expressed in the commentary are solely those of @entity189			0

@entity189 : @entity6 , @entity5 help publicize @entity2 's brutality during a news *blackout*
@entity189 : but regimes like @entity2 's are getting savvy about using the internet for their own ends
authorities use fake bloggers , *doctored* videos to spread propaganda , he says
secret police collect web messages to follow up on anti-government forces , activists
