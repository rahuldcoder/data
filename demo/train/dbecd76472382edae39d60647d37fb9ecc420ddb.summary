-- he was a cold , calculating , " morally depraved " man who spent the last years of his socialite and megaphilanthropist mother 's life bilking her fortune to line his pockets			1
that 's one way to see @entity10 -- and it 's the only way , according to the prosecutors who secured a conviction against him for grand larceny and scheming to defraud his mother , @entity17			1
now as the 85 - year - old son prepares to be sentenced monday for his crimes , another portrait of him has emerged -- thanks to close friends and celebrity acquaintances ( including @entity25 and @entity26 ) who sent letters to the court in hopes of saving him from a lengthy prison sentence			1
the man prosecutors described during the trial is apparently unrecognizable to many of @entity10 's friends and acquaintances			1
he was a loyal churchgoing man , a @entity38 recipient wounded in @entity39 during @entity40 and a son who tried mightily but could never live up to the high ideals of his socialite mother , according to letters friends submitted to the court			0
and now , they say he is a frail and sickly man who has faced extreme humiliation and would essentially be given a death sentence if a judge hands down the maximum sentence allowed			2
it will be up to judge @entity52 to decide how to reconcile the two portraits of @entity54			0
he faces a minimum 1 to 3 years , or as much as 8 to 25 years in state prison			1
the drastically differing views have only further heightened interest in the case , which during the trial stage was a tabloid feeding frenzy , fostering headlines such as " bad heir day , " " mrs. @entity17 's disaster " and " @entity64 's kick in the @entity65			2
" the witness list was a virtual " @entity67 " of @entity69 's social elite -- including @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 and @entity74			0
during the case , prosecutors and witnesses portrayed @entity10 as an only son preying on his physically and mentally ill 101 - year - old mother			0
assistant district attorney @entity80 called the case " disturbing , " and said the trial told the story of " how a son , an only son , would stoop so low to steal from his own mother in the sunset years of her life in order to line his own pockets and the pockets of his wife			0
" his only goal , they said , was to selfishly tap her fortune -- money that prosecutors said @entity65 intended to donate to ordinary @entity69 who needed help after she died			0
he was convicted of the most serious charges against him -- first - degree grand larceny and scheming to defraud			0
one of the most serious convictions involved @entity10 giving himself a $ 1 million - a - year raise for handling his mother 's affairs , @entity80 said			1
during trial testimony , @entity10 's lawyers called no character witnesses to come to his defense			1
so the new letters from friends are the first attempts by those who know him to share what they believe is his true character			0
@entity26 told a judge in her letter that she met @entity54 and his wife @entity119 10 years ago when @entity26 moved into a building on the @entity121 with @entity122			1
unlike other residents who turned their nose up at her , @entity26 said she became quick friends with the @entity126			2
her interactions with @entity10 , she wrote , gave her an insight into his relationship with his mother , and in turn taught her about how fame can affect family dynamics			0
" i also understand what it must be like for my own daughter to be around my fame , " she wrote			0
" i am not comparing myself to @entity65 , but i 've seen how you can be dismissed as not being good enough , or hip enough , and seeing it happen to @entity10 made me make sure that it did n't happen to my own daughter			0
" the humiliation and ugliness of the trial was punishment enough and a prison sentence would be unjust , friends argued in the letters			2
@entity10 's cardiologist , @entity151 , also wrote to urge the judge to consider his age and health in sentencing			1
a prison sentence " will accelerate his deterioration from cardiac and neurologic disease and would result in his premature death due to medical complications , " he wrote			2
@entity163 's today show weatherman @entity25 came to @entity10 's defense too , having met him at his church 10 years ago			1
he argued @entity10 had suffered enough , paying a price greater than any sentence a judge could hand down -- seeing his son turn on him during the trial and being portrayed in a negative light each day			1
" given his advanced age and deteriorating health , justice may be better served by turning a compassionate eye towards this good son , father and patriot and finding it in your heart not to add ' prisoner ' to @entity10 's otherwise unblemished resume , " @entity25 wrote in his letter to the court			1
@entity26 too , believed " breaking this man " by putting him in prison , was not the right punishment			2
" please do n't put him in jail , " she writes at the end of her letter			0
" it would only amount to an unnecessary cruelty that would serve no real purpose			0
has n't @entity10 been through enough ? " @entity0 's @entity194 contributed to this report .			2

@entity26 , @entity25 among those asking for a compassionate sentence
@entity54 convicted of bilking mom @entity17 of money before her death
he faces a minimum 1 to 3 years , or as much as 8 to 25 years in state prison
friends cite @entity10 's age of 85 , deteriorating health , among reasons for light sentence
