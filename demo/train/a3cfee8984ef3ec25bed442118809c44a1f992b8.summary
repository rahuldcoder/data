a prominent @entity1 cleric has created a storm of controversy by appearing on a popular television show alongside his wife , whose face was uncovered , challenging a fundamental religious tradition in the conservative kingdom			1
@entity9 once headed the religious police in the @entity11 of @entity12 , but now says the full - face veil imposed on all women in the country is not imperative in @entity16			1
" no one is saying that it is not allowed for a woman to cover her face , but i am saying that it is not obligatory and i have evidence in jurisprudence of this , " @entity9 told @entity17 , the female host of the television program			2
he explained that people became confused about ancient texts that mentioned the head scarf and the robe that women were commanded to wear			1
" later , people confused the hijab , which was imposed only on the wives of the @entity34 , with what @entity35 imposed on @entity38 women in general , " @entity9 said			1
the bold statements contest @entity1 's image as a nation of women clad in loose black garb known as abayas and peering through a face veil , or niqab , from behind the required male guardian			1
" my message to @entity52 is to fear @entity53 , " @entity1 's grand mufti @entity48 told the @entity1 news site @entity50			2
" you should ask repentance from @entity53 , and to back away from this mistake before you meet @entity53 with these sins			0
" although the country 's laws do not require the niqab , women who appear in public with uncovered faces may face harassment from religious police or even bystanders for ignoring the custom			1
" happy now ? every mobile phone now has a picture of your wife , you pimp , " one outraged post on @entity72 read			2
on the show , @entity74 's wife was dressed in a traditional black abaya , but also wore makeup , sported stylish sunglasses and carried a @entity80 purse as she spoke about the struggles her family faced			1
" this definitely affects us both positively and negatively , " said @entity83			0
" our children sometimes complain that fellow students and even teachers challenge them and start arguing with them			0
sometimes this affects them psychologically			0
" in the past , the controversial cleric -- who is despised by more conservative religious figures -- has said that women may go out in public without a male guardian , wear makeup and even mingle with the opposite sex in appropriate environments , all violations of custom in @entity1			1
" when @entity104 and i put this episode on air , our aim was not to clash with social beliefs and established norms which were not discussed before but to create a balance in opinions within our society , " @entity100 , the host of the program , told sister network @entity102 on monday			0
a photograph of @entity115 sitting between his wife , who wore colored clothing , and a blonde woman in a sleeveless dress -- which was allegedly snapped during a visit to @entity122 -- spread on social media as critics tried to discredit the sheikh			0
the longstanding debate plays out beyond the @entity128 state and across the @entity131 world , where most mainstream religious leaders argue that the face veil stems from tribal tradition rather than @entity135 law			2
that 's also the view of @entity139 's @entity138 , the highest seat of @entity16 scholarship			0
" some foolish people need to stop their accusations to senior @entity150 scholars and describing them with ignorance , " @entity142 , a former senior imam of the @entity143 in @entity12 , said in a tweet defending the couple 's television appearance			1
" choose what you want and hold your tongue			0
" after online users shared the weekend interview widely , racking up over a million views on @entity158 , @entity9 told the newspaper @entity159 he has received death threats for his wife 's public appearance			1
" for those who accuse me of wanting celebrity or fame , accuse me of worse than that , this is not the issue , " @entity9 said to critics in the saturday interview			2
" keep your opinions , but do not judge me on them			0
instead , debate me on my argument			0

@entity175 was formerly the head of religious police in @entity12
he 's no *stranger* to controversy : he 's said *previously* that women can wear makeup
since his wife appeared with no veil , @entity9 said he 's gotten death threats
