-- there are lots of experts who have lots of opinions about @entity7 's new plan to encourage breast - feeding in new moms by urging hospitals not to give them baby formula			1
advocates praise the move as a way to limit the influence of formula manufacturers on new mothers			0
skeptics wonder whether the policy will shame women who choose not to breast - feed			2
as for my sister - in - law , @entity24 , who recently gave birth in a @entity28 hospital to her first child , she knows first - hand how nurses pushing formula can impact an inexperienced mother			2
after her c - section , a nurse offered to give her newborn a bottle " to make it easier on you			0
" exhausted and uncertain , she agreed — even though she 'd intended to breast - feed			2
" i was a new mom , " she said			0
" i did n't know what i was doing			0
" those are exactly the sorts of moms that mayor @entity43 hopes to influence with his voluntary latch on @entity7 initiative			1
when it goes into effect in september , nurses in participating hospitals will be instructed not to give formula to babies unless there 's a medical reason to do so or unless moms specifically request it ( they 'll first have to listen to a mandatory speech about why breast is best )			1
@entity58 will be locked away like medication , and staff will be required to sign it out , track its distribution and report those figures to the @entity63 , which presumably wants to know whether the new policy will cut formula use citywide			0
twenty - seven of the city 's 40 hospitals have agreed to participate			0
time.com : what @entity69 has to do with breast - feeding and infant formula sound extreme ? not to @entity73 , an internist who is on the board of the @entity76 @entity75			1
" i ca n't even get an alcohol wipe without swiping my badge , " says @entity73			0
" hospitals lock up just about everything from @entity81 to gauze			0
the question we should be asking is , why are n't they locking up formula ? the reason is because they get it for free			2
" typically , formula manufacturers stock hospitals with free samples of their products to encourage brand - name adoption			2
many hospitals across the country still give away diaper bags packed with formula samples to new moms , despite increasing awareness that the practice may stymie breast - feeding			1
moms need more support to breast - feed exclusively that practice is changing , though : many hospitals nationwide have voluntarily banned the bags , and in july , @entity110 became the second state to go " bag - free , " with all 49 of its maternity hospitals pledging to spurn the formula freebies			1
( @entity115 was first in 2011			0
) the @entity116 ( @entity116 ) advises moms to breast - feed exclusively for about six months , then continue breast - feeding while offering new foods			1
in july , an annual gathering of state @entity116 leaders voted to support a resolution entitled " divesting from @entity125 in @entity126 " that would call on pediatricians " not to provide formula company gift bags , coupons and industry - authored handouts to the parents of newborns and infants in office and clinic settings			2
" the resolution , which now must be considered by the academy 's board of directors , is proving controversial as it demands the organization decide how far to push its support of breast - feeding			1
" we 're not going to argue about the benefits of breast - feeding because we all know that , " says @entity116 president dr. @entity147 , who has two adopted daughters who relied on formula			1
" we stop short of saying if you do n't breast - feed , you 're a terrible mother			2
" there are a lot of babies who need to be formula - fed. breast - feeding advocates would disagree with this			1
they say any baby can be breast - fed by any mother			2
but there are legitimate reasons for babies to need formula			0
" time.com : can a formula company really promote breast - feeding and fight child obesity ? but there are also " booby traps " — what breast - feeding advocacy group @entity173 for babes terms the obstacles keeping women from breast - feeding success			1
those include lack of support from employers , communities , hospitals and doctors who care for moms and babies			0
pediatricians , suggests best for babes , should take continuing education courses on the basics of lactation management			0
" pediatricians need to be as proficient in this area as they are in diagnosing a heart murmur , pneumonia or the common flu , " wrote @entity186 co-founder @entity190 in an e-mail			0
opinion : breast - feeding is intuitive and easy ? no ! in @entity7 , 90 % of moms start out breast - feeding , but more than two - thirds stop or incorporate infant formula by two months			1
to try to shift that number , latch on @entity7 is rolling out a full complement of subway ads , with three posters comparing formula ( unfavorably ) to breast milk , and featuring a racial cross-section of mothers			2
a press release about the campaign explains the relationship between formula and breast - feeding success : if the baby is not given anything but breast milk , especially in the first month after the baby is born , almost every mother will make enough milk for her baby			1
using baby formula during this time can decrease the production of milk , and consequently make the mother reliant on formula			0
time.com : what the @entity76 can learn from @entity230 about breast - feeding but the @entity232 — which represents formula manufacturers and marketers — maintains that restricting access to formula is n't the key to boosting breast - feeding rates			1
" a way to help mothers is to be supportive of the feeding choice they make for their infants regardless if they choose breast - feeding , formula feeding or a combination of both , " @entity239 , the council 's executive vice president , wrote in an e-mail			1
" for infants who are not breast - fed , infant formula is the only safe , nutritious and recommended feeding option			1
" @entity254 is right , of course , about formula being the only widely available alternative to breast milk ( there 's donor milk too , though not enough to nourish all formula - fed babies )			2
she 's right too about the need to support a mom 's choice			0
but she 's not necessarily right when she says that limiting formula does n't impact breast - feeding rates			1
@entity269 , which has already restricted access to formula , has seen its breast - feeding rate increase from 39 % to 68 % by doing so			1
" @entity7 is definitely ahead of the curve , " @entity272 , a parent education coordinator in the hospital 's mother - baby unit , told the @entity275			2
in my sister - in - law 's experience — and in the experience of dozens of mothers who shared their stories of feeling undermined when they were offered formula in the hospital — @entity7 's policy seems to make sense			2
time.com : moms say it 's hard to breast - feed for the recommended six months it does to @entity293 , who had read what felt like every breast - feeding book imaginable in preparation for her daughter 's arrival			1
" i was ready , " wrote @entity293 in an e-mail			0
but then her daughter had a hard time latching on and instead of offering help , a nurse offered formula ; @entity293 took it			0
she kept working at breast - feeding and things improved , so they went home — free formula gift bag in tow			1
at home , " feeling alone and confused , " @entity293 gave her daughter some of the free formula			0
" my daughter had serious nipple confusion after that and the hospital bottles , and it took several weeks of hard , time - consuming work and dedication ... to get her to take the breast again			0
" @entity293 has since become a board - certified lactation consultant in @entity324 , inspired by her personal struggle to feed her child			0
" in my work , i regularly see clients that tell me that they were n't going to give bottles , but , you know , that can was there and it seemed like it would be easier			0
... it 's a real problem that is keeping moms from attaining their own breastfeeding goals , " says @entity293			0
" it 's not the entire issue , but it certainly does n't help			0
