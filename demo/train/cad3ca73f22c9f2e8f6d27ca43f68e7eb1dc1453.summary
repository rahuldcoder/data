-- " @entity1 " on the football pitch used to mean a very different thing in @entity4			1
in a country where @entity8 is spreading faster than anywhere else on the planet -- with around 7,000 reported cases so far -- each droplet of bodily fluid evokes suspicion			1
here , even a post-match handshake is an uneasy encounter			2
in this fearful new climate , football has been banned			1
and to sports - obsessed @entity4 , the embargo is tantamount to forbidding @entity18			1
" football is like a second religion in @entity4 , " explained the country 's @entity20 president @entity19			1
" bearing in mind this is a poor country , you would have situations where people would rather go without food , just so they could buy tickets to a big football match			1
" on sundays , the long stretch of sand at @entity34 , outside the capital of @entity36 , would usually be filled with thousands of people playing the national sport			1
that was before the outbreak which has had over 1,400 new cases in the last three weeks alone , making @entity4 set to eclipse @entity42 as the worst - affected country on the globe , according to the @entity45			1
now the national premier league has been suspended			2
casual kick - abouts in the community have dried up			1
even watching the game in halls and cinemas has come to a standstill			1
" this virus is about sweat , blood , and interaction , " said 50 - year - old @entity19 , when i meet her in an inner - city @entity54 © , a world away from the devastation back home			2
" and that 's football			1
there 's a lot of interaction , there 's a lot of sweat and blood			0
" do n't touch beyond the deadly virus itself , are the psychological effects on a naturally " touchy , feely people who love to hug and hold hands , " said @entity19			1
" it 's a very strained and difficult place to be in mentally			0
you have to reprogram yourself			1
so you find that when people reach out to you , it 's kind of like ' argh , ' she says , screwing up her elegant face and holding up her hands			1
" i think one of the vital things we 've failed to adhere to as a people , is not to touch a sick person , " she says of a disease in which 20 % of transmissions happen during burials			1
" and that is such basic humanity , is n't it ? when someone you love is sick , you want to hold that person , you want to carry them , " says the mother - of - one			1
" but you ca n't			0
" invisible enemy just over a decade after the civil war which left more than 50,000 people dead , the country is now facing a new , invisible enemy			1
" it 's not like the war that we 've been through whereby you saw the rebels coming , " said @entity19 , who as a little girl never owned a doll , instead playing football with her brothers and their friends			2
" but with @entity8 , you wake up one morning and it 's hit a town , it 's hit another town			1
for a long time we did n't know the signs , we did n't know the symptoms to look out for			0
" @entity121 's call indeed , what initially appears to be a common cold , can quickly escalate into vomiting , diarrhea , and bleeding -- both internally and externally			0
transmission through bodily fluids makes football a ripe setting for infection , and last month @entity121 reneged on hosting the 2015 @entity130 due to fears over the spread of the disease			2
" let 's just say i was n't surprised , " said @entity19 , who is also owner of a premier league club called -- @entity136			0
" i think if i was in @entity121 's position , i would be focusing on saving lives and wanting to contain the ebola virus , " she says with a resigned sigh			0
coming from @entity4 , @entity19 knows full well what it 's like having to " beg to play in other countries			1
" her country 's players have reportedly suffered " humiliating " prejudice at away games , with opponents refusing to their shake hands and crowds chanting " @entity8 " at matches			1
women 's work personally , @entity19 also suffered " the most humiliating attacks i have ever endured " -- though rather than @entity8 , she says they related to her gender			1
as one of only two women to head a national football association in the world , @entity19 says she came under fire in a country where " women are still perceived to know their place			2
" " in @entity4 , football is their all			1
and you do n't see women playing it , you do n't see women telling them how to do it , and you certainly do n't see women organizing it , " says the daughter of one of the founding members of the country 's @entity175 , who as a child grew up with footballers constantly walking in and out of her family home			0
" yes , horrible things were said about me that i would n't want to repeat			0
very , very degrading things and cartoons			0
bearing in mind , that i am a mother , and i am somebody 's wife , and i am somebody 's daughter , " she says about slurs during her campaign for the top job in 2012			0
her coping method has been to switch off from local media and social networks			0
" i do n't see it , i do n't read it , " she says			0
" i kind of disconnect from that and just stay focused			0
" cleaning up she believes part of the vitriol has come from her hardline stance on corruption			0
" the @entity20 was in total tatters before i came in , " she says			0
" we had a bad reputation internally and externally			0
integrity was at an all time low			0
" and in a country where football and gambling go hand - in - hand , @entity19 's zero tolerance was a hard pill to swallow			2
" if people choose to gamble as a recreational pastime , well that 's up to them , " she says , hands clasped around a mug of mint tea			2
" but you can not have people in high administrative offices participating in gambling or betting			2
it 's a no - no. " when it comes to corruption allegations at the highest levels of football 's international governing body , @entity228 , @entity19 is less willing to talk tough			2
" all these things that are swimming around , these controversies , is something that i really would n't like to get involved in , " she says			0
" it 's really unfortunate , and i 'm really hoping that @entity228 can rise above it much sooner than later , " she says of the organization which this year gave @entity4 's @entity20 $ 750,000 plus another $ 50,000 towards social projects used for tackling @entity8			1
does that mean @entity19 will be voting for @entity228 president @entity238 in next year 's election ? " @entity238 has been very supportive of @entity242 nations and trying to build up our football development , " she says , choosing her words carefully			2
" and in that respect i think , not just myself , but i most @entity242 countries will recognize that			0
" for now , her main focus is on the virus which has so far claimed over 1,400 lives across the country , and silenced its beloved football fields			2
" we 're just waiting for that day when they tell us -- boom ! -- the vaccine is out , go and take your jabs , " she says			0
" every morning we wake up waiting to hear that message			0
" and it 'll come			0
" insight : ' criminal ' twist in @entity263 scandal investigation : why women were n't good enough for @entity228 report			0

@entity4 ' love affair with football hit by @entity8
games *canceled* , watching in public spaces stopped
people must ' reprogram ' themselves not to touch
psychological effects on naturally ' touchy , feely ' community
