-- let 's give praise where praise is due			2
invisible children 's @entity5 viral video campaign has done what no other advocacy organization has been able to do until now : capture 29 minutes worth of attention from over 50 million people worldwide			1
no amount of advertising genius from " @entity13 " could create that kind of buzz in a few days			2
in less than a week , @entity6 ( @entity6 ) has cemented the legitimacy of social media for global engagement if the @entity19 had n't already			1
but the problem is , as many have pointed out , it is the wrong conversation and wrong buzz			1
which is just too bad because this campaign has the makings of what could have been a truly transformational development communication experiment			0
in two weeks , @entity6 will have millions of dollars ; you will have a t - shirt and bracelet ; and @entity31 and @entity32 will be left wondering what just happened			1
as we saw in the case of the @entity19 social media - accelerated uprising , the agents of the conversation were those directly affected by the cause du jour - which at the time was to oust decades - long dictatorial rule			1
instead , what we have here is a narrowly - focused fund - raising campaign where one organization inserts itself as the agent of change to a foreign travesty against humanity			2
once again , let me be clear , there 's nothing wrong with bringing attention to the issue			2
it 's how it was done that i lament			0
in a few weeks , this breathless enthusiasm will be for naught			0

" but they have n't			0
why ? because no one has invaded our @entity76 time line demanding we watch a 30 - minute @entity78 production simplifying the issue for us			0
it is an indictment on what moves us to act			0
what does it say about our capacity to care when we are barely moved by video shot on shaky cellphone cameras of innocent people being slaughtered , but we suddenly get a collective conscious because of a slick @entity78 production documenting a 25 - year - old issue on the decline			0
more children die of malaria , diarrhea , and nodding disease in northern @entity31 on a daily basis than the monthly average of @entity98 's 25 years of killing			1
where 's the slick viral video for those children ? the advent of social media brought so many unheard voices to the fore , and with that voice came self - actualization			1
many communities realized that they have inherent agency to be their own saviors			0
@entity5 missed a grand opportunity to empower these voices to realize the power within themselves to change their situation and surroundings			1
instead , it trotted out the same tired line about @entity32			2
torture , rape , conscription ; tent poles for the single , sad story on @entity32 that western society has come to accept			1
but by @entity128 we are so much more than the sum of our failures			0
profile : @entity98 : brutal warlord who shocked world the charity missed an opportunity to empower the many @entity31 and @entity136 voices newly visible with the advent of mobile technology and social media tools on the continent			1
instead of enjoining us to work together to amplify pressure on our governing bodies to address security and development holes , @entity6 has taken the initiative to proposition an outside agency to do it for us			0
how are we ever going to awaken to our civil responsibility to demand more from our sitting governments if we are lulled into a dependency state for every civil service we should rightly expect from our governments ? the attention is on the wrong audience , for the wrong message , using the wrong messenger			0
i would have welcomed an opportunity for @entity6 to partner with those of us visible and empowered to drive the conversation to its rightful audience , therein instilling a permanent sense of strong civic responsibility that is the basis of all modern societies			0
if i can take anything good from this , it is that i hope this visibility provided by @entity6 will usher those of us @entity31 engaged in this conversation to realize we have a right to exercise our agency when we are called to do so			1
and when we do galvanize around an agenda that we set , that we are wise enough to partner with individuals that can accelerate that message			0
the opinions expressed are solely those of @entity177 .			2

invisible children 's " @entity5 " cemented the legitimacy of social media for global engagement , says @entity177
but the @entity185 social media *strategist* says the film created " wrong conversation and wrong buzz " .
@entity190 told same story about @entity32 and failed to empower *locals* to change the situation , *argues* @entity177 .
@entity177 expects the @entity31 engaged in this conversation to realize that they have a right to exercise their agency .
