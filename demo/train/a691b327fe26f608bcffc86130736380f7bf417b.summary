-- it 's not every day you get a chance to kiteboard across the @entity4 evading sharks after winning a social media competition			1
@entity8 's day job in insurance and retirement planning had hardly prepared him for the " scary experience " of coming up close and personal with a shark during a daredevil crossing of the @entity4 in a six - strong team of kiteboarders			1
@entity8 , nicknamed ' @entity16 ' -- @entity17 for small -- was cruising the waves on the second day out of @entity19 in the @entity20 when he spotted the unmistakable fins " about 24 feet away " from his rig			1
the 30 - year - old from @entity25 in @entity26 was the final team member to be selected after winning a @entity28 competition and had to put up with constant ribbing from his fellow team members about the incident during the remainder of the 27 - day landmark crossing of the ocean			1
kiteboarding harnesses the power of the wind using a large kite suspended on four lines and @entity8 learned the ropes of the sport on the @entity42 , but conditions in the @entity4 were altogether more challenging			1
apart from the odd encounter with sharks , he also rode through schools of flying fish and had the unusual experience of surfing the waves through the night			1
the team , consisting of @entity8 , four @entity52 and one woman -- 30 - year - old @entity53 -- were assigned two shifts of two hours each per day -- one in the daylight and one at night -- so constant progress was made on the 4,000 mile ( 6,000km ) plus crossing to their destination in the @entity59 and @entity60			1
support crew a support boat -- a @entity64 catamaran -- was a constant companion , with five crew members including the @entity52 professional sailor @entity67 as team captain			1
@entity69 is a three - time world champion -- competing against the likes of @entity72 's sailing great @entity73 -- but for the 43 - year - old @entity52 this was an altogether different challenge			1
constant vigilance was required in case the kiteboarders were dumped into the waters at high speeds , particularly in the dark and the crew had to develop rigorous safety procedures			1
only at the finish after nearly a month at sea did @entity69 understand the physical and mental demands			2
" when we came into the harbor i suddenly realized how tired i was , " he told @entity0			2
with his sailing expertise , @entity69 was one of the first people recruited to the challenge , which was the brainchild of @entity95 van @entity93 , who set up the @entity96 with the express aim of completing inspiring and original challenges			1
ground breaking feat " we have done something groundbreaking , " said the 30 - year - old @entity52 , but admitted he was in a " state of shock " at the finish on december 17			1
@entity103 , found the night sessions the most exhilarating , " the only thing you could see was the rope and the kite in front of you			2
" he added : " @entity110 really went places with this challenge			2
" kiteboarding or kitesurfing may indeed be going places , with another crew member , @entity115 , 28 , from @entity116 confident it will eventually be included in the @entity117			2
only a late volte face by the @entity119 ( @entity119 ) saw a decision to replace windsurfing with kitesurfing for the @entity123 in @entity124 reversed			2
@entity115 makes his living in the sport 's industry and believes its growing popularity lies in its wide appeal with all ages able to participate			2
" you can just cruise around , but for me kitesurfing is a physical sport and very competitive			0
" during the @entity4 crossing , @entity115 lived up to his ethos , determined to clock up the most distance for a two - hour stint			1
" 74 kilometers , " he said proudly			0
but he also acknowledged that it had been very much a team affair , with the only female team member playing her full part			1
" @entity53 was the lightest and took on the most squalls			0
" girl power indeed @entity53 , from @entity145 , proved her worth on many occasions , particularly in lighter winds as they became becalmed			0
" i would definitely do it again			0
i did not want to get off the boat , " she reflected			0
the other female to actively participate -- a woman producer from a @entity52 tv channel was on board to film the action -- was medic @entity155 - a 28 - year - old doctor from @entity116 , who specializes in paediatrics			1
she was selected for her professional abilities and is also a trained sailor			0
but despite that experience , she admitted to a degree of trepidation throughout the challenge , in case of a major injury			0
" a shark bite , or high impact trauma , that would have been a real problem , " she said			0
" we were really alone in the middle of the ocean			0
" @entity8 's brush with a shark aside , the closest @entity155 came to that nightmare scenario was an accident which befell @entity176 , who " got it a bit wrong " at the start of a new stint			0
gijsbers was forced under a support dinghy moving at five knots for about five seconds -- " it felt like 15 seconds " -- and only narrowly escaped serious injury , other than a few cuts and bruises			0
" she ( @entity155 ) was checking my lungs and i threw up a lot of salt water , " he said			0
danger guy it underlined the inherent risks in the challenge , " i was the danger guy , " joked @entity176 , but each team member was hand picked for their abilities			2
@entity201 was the oldest kiteboarder at 40 years of age , but is the @entity52 champion in the sport of @entity206 , where competitors propel themselves on a flat surfboard using only a single paddle			2
" it was 11 people on the boat all working together , real teamwork , " he said			0
@entity201 was grateful to @entity69 and his skill when he went down during a night stint and was picked up within minutes			0
in pitch darkness it proved a surreal experience , " the water is nice and clear , an island of light around you , " @entity201 recalled , but he was grateful for the prompt rescue			0
glorious arrival the team eventually arrived to " red carpet " treatment at a luxury resort complex in the @entity59 and @entity60 , and a glowing tribute from the governor of the @entity72 overseas dependency			1
" the feat of the @entity96 organization in completing this marathon across one of the world 's wildest oceans is awe inspiring , " said @entity232			0
it remains to be seen whether other relay teams attempt to beat their new record but for now @entity103 is content to live with the memories			1
" we crossed the @entity4 sailing and kiting and it was perfect , " he said with pride			1
meanwhile @entity8 will go back to his desk in the @entity249 and dream of getting the call for the next challenge			0
we shall see , we shall see , " he said .			0
