-- when the @entity2 recently lifted economic sanctions on @entity4 , it closed a decades - long chapter designed to encourage democratic reform in the country			1
although an arms embargo remains in place , the action will send an unequivocal message of " mission accomplished			0
" but while the @entity2 is celebrating the " new @entity4 , " @entity14 @entity13 in the western part of the country are targets in what appears to be an ongoing campaign of government - supported crimes against humanity and ethnic cleansing			1
killings and arson attacks between ethnic @entity26 and @entity14 @entity13 first erupted in @entity4 's @entity27 in june 2012 , and were followed in october by well - coordinated attacks on @entity14 populations			1
more than 125,000 @entity14 were forced into dozens of internally displaced camps while tens of thousands of others fled the country , launching @entity34 's newest refugee crisis			1
satellite images obtained by @entity36 from just five of the 13 townships that experienced violence since june show 27 unique zones of destruction , including the destruction of 4,862 structures covering 348 acres of mostly @entity13 - owned residential property			1
@entity4 's government has repeatedly characterized what happened as " inter-communal violence " between bitter enemies -- @entity48 @entity26 and @entity14 @entity13 -- denying any involvement of the state or abuses by state security officials			1
since june , i visited several sites of attacks and every major camp for the displaced , interviewing more than 100 victims and witnesses of abuse , as well as some perpetrators of violence			2
there is extensive evidence of complicity of the state in ethnic cleansing			1
following the first wave of violence and without setting foot in @entity27 , the @entity2 and others were quick to welcome the @entity4 authorities ' " measured response " to the crisis			2
a spokesperson for the @entity2 's high representative on foreign affairs , @entity74 , said on june 11 , " we believe that the security forces are handling this difficult inter-communal violence in an appropriate way			2
" the reality on the ground was very different			0
@entity14 survivors alleged how in june soldiers not only failed to protect them from arsonist mobs , but opened fire when they attempted to extinguish the fires , killing scores			2
government authorities in @entity27 were busy bulldozing mosques , blocking humanitarian aid to @entity14 populations , conducting violent mass arrests of @entity13 men and boys , and digging mass graves , impeding accountability			1
@entity36 located the existence of at least four such grave sites			0
in pictures : @entity4 's sectarian crisis two days after the @entity2 's june statement , a government truck dumped 18 naked and half - clothed bodies near a camp for displaced @entity14 , according to @entity36			1
some of the victims had been " hogtied " with string or plastic strips before being executed			0
the move sent a strong message , consistent with a policy of ethnic cleansing , that the @entity14 should leave @entity4 permanently			1
" they dropped the bodies right here , " a @entity14 man told me on a visit to the grave site			2
" three bodies had gunshot wounds			0
some had burns , some had stab wounds			0
" after the smoke cleared in june , the @entity48 @entity125 monkhood ( or the sangha ) , political operatives , and local government officials allegedly held public meetings in @entity27 , plotting to drive @entity14 @entity13 from their homes			1
they seized on president @entity133 's remarks on july 12 that " illegal " @entity14 should be sent to " third countries , " and they actively worked to isolate @entity13 communities from daily necessities and income			1
influential groups released public statements calling explicitly for " ethnic cleansing " and forced population transfer -- the government took no action to stop them			1
the planned second wave of violence began on october 22			0
thousands of @entity48 reportedly descended by foot and boat on @entity13 villages in nine townships , carrying machetes , swords , spears , homemade guns , @entity157 cocktails , and other weapons			2
plumes of smoke dotted the sky along the fertile patchwork of @entity27 's intra-coastal waterways as entire villages were razed			0
state security forces once again either failed to provide protection , or actively participated in attacks			0
on october 23 in @entity169 , @entity170 , security forces took away sticks and other rudimentary weapons from @entity14 and enabled an @entity48 mob to kill about 70 villagers , including 28 children , 13 of whom were under age five			2
today , tens of thousands of displaced @entity14 are being denied access to humanitarian aid , have their movements restricted , and are unable to return home			2
they live in segregated , squalid camps without adequate food and health services			0
in just weeks the monsoon season will flood several @entity188 sites , intensifying the humanitarian emergency			0
at the root of the persecution is the question of citizenship			0
the @entity4 government considers all @entity14 to be immigrants from @entity196			1
they are denied citizenship under discriminatory national legislation from 1982 , although many families have resided in @entity4 for generations			0
official government statements reject their very existence and refer to them as " @entity205 , " " so - called @entity14 , " or the pejorative " kalar			0
" the world should not be blinded by the excitement of @entity4 's political opening			1
@entity14 are paying for that approach with their lives			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity215 .			0

@entity215 : despite reforms , ethnic cleansing continues against @entity4 's @entity219
attacks between ethnic @entity26 and @entity14 @entity13 erupted in june
more than 125,000 @entity14 were forced into dozens of internally displaced camps
@entity215 : @entity225 should not be blinded by the excitement of @entity4 's political opening
