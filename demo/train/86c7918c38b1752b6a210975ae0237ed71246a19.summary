@entity1 duck , steamed dumplings or a glass of green tea : these are the culinary offerings most associated with @entity5			1
but beer ? believe it or not , @entity5 is the beer - chugging capital of the world			1
the @entity10 public gulped down 59.3 billion liters of alcohol in 2012 -- nearly double the amount quaffed in the @entity13 accounted for 84 % of that figure , according to market research firm @entity15			2
yet per capita , @entity10 consumption was only about 35 liters annually -- less than half of the @entity18 , according to @entity19 -- and still has enormous room to grow			1
that has led to a microbrewery boom in @entity1			1
" there 's a whole slew of places that are about to emerge , " said @entity23 , owner of @entity1 's @entity24			1
" for anyone interested in anything besides lagers and @entity32 , it 's on			2
" enter @entity33 , a 31 - year old native of @entity34 , @entity35 , who had barely touched alcohol until he was 25			1
after college , he landed in @entity39 , @entity40 where an agency found him work at @entity43			2
@entity33 , an it specialist , walked away from his lucrative career and jumped into the microbrewery business because he saw a niche			0
" never let a market that has a requirement go unsupplied , " said @entity33 , who opened @entity47 in october 2010			0
last year , @entity50 grossed $ 225,000 with @entity5 's low operating costs cutting into only about a quarter of that figure			1
on a recent saturday night , the bar 's open air courtyard and small anteroom in @entity56 were standing room only as a flustered bartender struggled to keep glasses full			1
" the greatest accomplishment is that people come here , " said @entity33 , who recently opened a second location on @entity61 expats originally dominated the @entity1 microbrewing scene , but that is changing			1
the clientele has been diversifying rapidly as more @entity10 return from stints abroad and with greater levels of disposable income , according to microbrewers			0
the growing appeal to locals , however , may have more to do with the product itself			2
great leap infuses traditional @entity10 ingredients with time - honored brewing techniques			2
drinks like the " @entity81 , " blended with hints of @entity81 tea or the " @entity84 " incorporating @entity10 " large bark cinnamon			0
" the " @entity89 , " @entity90 most popular , is infused with the mouth - numbing essence of the @entity88 ( huajiao )			2
all sell for between 30 and 50 rmb ( $ 4.89 -- $ 8.15 ) a glass			0
@entity95 opened @entity97 brewery in february 2012 with distribution to various expat friendly hotels , restaurants and bars , and followed up with the @entity102 in @entity103 in december			0
" i 've always been someone who recognized and valued quality , " said @entity95 , a former @entity18 army sergeant from @entity104 , 46 , first came to @entity5 in 1994 as a student at the @entity108 and after an 11 - year hiatus bounced around the @entity10 start - up world before settling into his latest venture with @entity97			1
offering a more traditional selection of homebrews , @entity97 's popular brands are the captain 's @entity116 , @entity118 and @entity119			0
@entity95 , too , is looking to capitalize on soaring @entity10 demand			0
but @entity97 uses mostly imported ingredients , catering to the popular belief that foreign food products are superior to domestic			2
microbrews in @entity1 are more than just keeping glasses full			1
@entity50 and @entity97 are both based deep within traditional @entity1 residential " hutong " neighborhoods and have paid particular attention to adapting their presence seamlessly to locals			1
" strangers in hutongs are never welcome , " said @entity33			0
great leap maintains a strict midnight closing and even earlier hours in summer and during university exams , while @entity97 made their space ( almost ) completely soundproof			0
both men too have married into @entity10 families and are currently raising their own			0
community relations is just one of the unique challenges that both face as small business owners in @entity1			1
laws and regulations are often ambiguous and @entity33 admitted that " you have to make use of personal connections " to get things done			0
for @entity97 , the biggest challenge came in the form of intellectual property			1
" if you 're not being copied then you 're not relevant , " said @entity95 , who said he required " constant and rapid innovation " to stay ahead of the curve			1
@entity95 estimated that eight to 10 new microbreweries were about to emerge			2
" sometimes they come in here and they are taking pictures of the tiles on the wall			0
" at the recent 2013 @entity164 awards , it was a banner night for @entity50 which swept several categories including " @entity166 , " " @entity167 " and " @entity168 , " for the famously cantankerous @entity33			0
not to be outdone , @entity97 received the " @entity170 " award			0
@entity95 , though , said he is focused on the big picture			0
" @entity97 is not in competition with any other local brewery , " he said			0
" there are 20 million people in this city and the more local @entity1 breweries , the greater the likelihood that there will be a craft beer revolution in @entity1			1

@entity5 is the beer - chugging capital of the world , drinking twice as much as the @entity18
per capita consumption of beer is still half that of @entity18 , showing room for growth
a growing number of foreign - run microbreweries have launched in @entity1
biggest challenge is intellectual property : " if you 're not being copied then you 're not relevant "
