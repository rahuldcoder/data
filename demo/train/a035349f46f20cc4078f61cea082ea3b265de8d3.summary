@entity1 , @entity0 -- hailed as @entity5 's greatest actor , he 's the legendary star of @entity6 and leader of the mighty @entity9 clan			1
@entity2 talked to @entity9 , the @entity10 of @entity11 , at an @entity13 event in @entity1 ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...			1
. @entity9 talks to @entity14 on the green carpet at the @entity16 in @entity17 , @entity0 @entity2 : right now , it 's an exciting time for @entity11			1
@entity9 : yes , i think it is			1
it 's a great progression from where we were a few years ago , where even though we were the highest - making film nation in the world , we were looked upon with a certain amount of criticism and skepticism about our content and the way we make our films			1
gradually , over the years , people have come to expect and accept that this is how we make the films , and it 's all turning out to be profitable and exciting with viewers all over the world			1
@entity2 : why do you think people had been so skeptical ? @entity9 : well , they felt that the content was n't exciting enough , they could n't understand the song and dance routine , they did n't like the very cliched stories or formulaic storylines , but that 's the way we are			1
we must have song and dance in our lives ; we 've had it ever since the inception of cinema in @entity5			1
our stories are very social - based , very human - based			2
we are a very emotional nation			2
all our culture and tradition of over 5,000 years has come through a lot of heat and fire and eventually come out on top			0
that 's how it is , and that 's how it 's going to remain			0
@entity2 : is @entity11 escapism for the @entity5 people ? @entity9 : you have to see it in a larger perspective			1
there are large numbers of people in @entity5 below the poverty line , there are large numbers of people who lead a meager existence			1
they want to find a little escape from the hardships of life , and come and watch something colorful and exciting and musical			2
so yes , the content of our television and our cinema is escapist in nature because we are there to provide entertainment			0
the select group of people who do make realistic cinema , who do make cinema perhaps a little more acceptable to the @entity102 audience , is a very small percentage			0
@entity2 : what are the main differences between a @entity106 and a @entity11 actor ? @entity9 : conceptually we are both the same			1
we are all human beings , we are actors , we are put in different situations and conditions and we act			0
perhaps the content of the @entity5 cinema is a lot more varied and diverse as compared to the ones the @entity106 actors get associated with			1
they more or less have a very single track presence , so to say			0
@entity5 actors , because of the format of our stories , need to be good actors , and be able to perform emotional sequences , do a bit of comedy , dance and singing , action , because all of this forms just one film			1
in many ways i 'd say there are greater demands on @entity5 actors than there are on @entity106			1
@entity2 : so do you think @entity106 actors could learn from the @entity11 actors ? @entity9 : i do n't know that we are worthy enough for learning something from us , but i do know that actors in @entity5 are very capable , very talented , and can be compared to the best anywhere in the world			1
@entity2 : what makes you the best actor in @entity5 ? @entity9 : i do n't use any techniques ; i 'm not trained to be an actor			1
i just enjoy working in films			1
it 's more instinctive rather than anything else			0
i do n't do the calculated rehearsed kind of approach , and i hope that i can continue that because i believe that instinct is much stronger and greater when you are performing on camera			0
@entity2 : tell us about the upcoming remake of " @entity6			2
" @entity9 : " @entity6 " is an extraordinary film			2
it 's the highest - grossing film and it had a great impact on our society			2
obviously remaking it is a huge task			0
we are purely using the inspiration of the film			0
i am playing the baddie in the film , as opposed to one of the leading men in the original			0
it 's a great challenge for any actor to do something different in a film			0
i will obviously not be playing the leading man , but it 's exciting			2
at my age you do n't get to run after the girl and win them over and fight the baddie , but i 'm happy that i 'm doing the negative role in this film and i 'm enjoying it ! @entity2 : tell us about " @entity184 " -- it 's becoming a bit of a family affair ! @entity9 : it 's a very powerful film , it takes influences from the @entity190			1
it 's not exactly a remake , but it took inspiration from the @entity190 and put it in " @entity195			0
" we are now doing " @entity195 2 , " which is going to have @entity199 , my son , and his wife to be , so i think it will be wonderful for the three of us to work together again			2
@entity184 will be a much larger film , larger in concept , larger in visuals			0
it promises to be very exciting			2
@entity2 : is it nice to work with your family ? @entity9 : the entire filming industry in @entity5 is one big family			1
we all feel that way whenever we make a film : it 's a very homely feeling ; we all live together , eat together , move around together			0
it 's a wonderful feeling			0
i do n't know how @entity106 behaves , but this is how we behave , and yes , when you have members of the family working with you it makes it all the more exciting			2
@entity2 : what 's next for you ? @entity9 : i think that it 's important that actors keep getting challenged every day			1
for every creative person it 's a terrible moment when they say they have done all they want to do			0
i like to feel the butterflies in the stomach , i like to go home and have a restless night and wonder how i 'm going to be able to accomplish this feat , get jittery			0
that hunger and those butterflies in the stomach are very essential for all creative people			0
i 'd like to believe that tomorrow is another challenge for me			0
i 'm sure there is lots more for me to do , because there is lots and lots of stuff still to be explored			0
