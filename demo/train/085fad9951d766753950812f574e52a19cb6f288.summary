@entity0 -- president @entity2 gave the go - ahead for @entity5 forces to raid a northern @entity7 housing compound based on " what was probably a 50 - 50 chance that @entity11 was there , " his national security adviser said			1
" it was a circumstantial case ... but what he had 100 percent confidence in was the ability of our special forces to execute the mission , " @entity14 told @entity1 's @entity15 on saturday , part of an interview that aired sunday on " @entity18			1
" on april 28 , @entity2 attended the last of several @entity26 meetings focused on finding and going after the @entity28 leader			0
during that meeting , some advocated for the commando raid while others advised against it , @entity14 said , given there had been no clear - cut sightings of @entity11 by that point			1
" he had gotten divided counsel , and that happens a lot in these things , as you would imagine , " @entity14 said			1
after a night 's sleep , @entity2 told @entity14 at 8:20 a.m. the next day to draft the order for the raid			1
by sunday evening -- which was early monday morning in @entity7 -- the 38 - minute mission was over , the 25 - strong @entity5 team having flown out of the country along with @entity11 's dead body			1
like other @entity2 administration officials , @entity14 applauded the decision and its end result of knocking out the no. 1 man on the @entity56 's " @entity57 " list			2
he called it " the single biggest achievement we 've ever had " in the fight against @entity28			0
especially as they continue poring through voluminous material taken from the complex , @entity5 authorities are more convinced than ever that @entity11 had a significant operational and strategic role , not to mention a key symbolic one , in the terrorist network			0
his death , said @entity14 , is a major blow to @entity28			0
" at the end of last year , we assessed that @entity28 had been diminished ... to its weakest since 2001 , " said the security adviser , who previously served in the administrations of presidents @entity72 and @entity74			2
" and they took a very big step back sunday			0
" one reason for that assessment is what @entity14 called the " extraordinary " amount of intelligence that @entity5 special forces were able to take from the @entity86 compound			0
a multi-agency task force is currently poring through those documents , computer hard drives and other materials -- intermittently releasing information including five videotapes featuring @entity11 that came out saturday			0
" this is the largest cache of information gotten from a senior terrorist -- gotten from any terrorist in one operation , " @entity14 said , calling the amount of seized material about equal to " the size of a small college library			1
" despite doubts from some conspiracy theorists , @entity28 itself has admitted that @entity11 was killed			0
that means that his deputy , @entity108 doctor and radical @entity109 , will rise to the top of the @entity56 list , according to @entity14 , even as @entity5 and allied forces continue their efforts to find him and other @entity28 leaders			0
last week , cia director @entity115 ( who @entity2 has nominated to succeed @entity116 as defense secretary ) told @entity119 members during a closed - door briefing that @entity7 was " either involved or incompetent , " according to two sources in attendance			2
there have been no indications @entity7 authorities knew about or acted upon knowledge that @entity11 was living in the same town as one of its top military academies			1
@entity14 did not suggest @entity7 authorities knew the @entity28 leader lived in the city , about 30 miles ( 50 kilometers ) north of the capital @entity134 , or that they somehow harbored him			1
he said , " i have not seen any evidence , at least to date , that the political , military or intelligence apparatus knew about the presence of @entity11			2
" yet @entity5 authorities are troubled by the fact that the @entity28 leader could stay there " for six years or so " undetected , said @entity14			0
" we 'll clearly be working with ( @entity7 authorities ) to understand how we got to this point , " he said			2
@entity14 noted @entity7 's active role in tracking down terrorists , calling them a " very important partner " despite the existence of some " differences " with @entity5 authorities			1
he said , " if we find things ... that are highly disturbing , we 'll certainly press that " -- though he expected that @entity134 and @entity0 would continue to work together			0
" we need to look at this in a calm and cool way , " @entity14 said , adding , " a relationship with @entity7 , given everything we have at stake in that region , is an important relationship			2

national security adviser @entity14 says @entity2 got " divided counsel " on raid
*relying* on a " circumstantial case , " the president gave the go - ahead the next morning
@entity14 says the amount of intel gathered is " about the size of a college library "
he says there 's no evidence @entity7 authorities knew that @entity11 was there
