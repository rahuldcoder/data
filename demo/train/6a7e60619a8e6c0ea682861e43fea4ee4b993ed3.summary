-- police in @entity5 , @entity6 , want to talk to the older brother of @entity8 , the 6 - year - old girl slain at home on christmas night 14 years ago , the @entity3 family 's attorney said			1
supporters of the family call it harassment			2
the brother , @entity3 , has no interest in once again answering questions he has answered for many investigators many times , said the attorney , @entity19 , of @entity20 , @entity21			1
and yet the mere hint of activity in one of the nation 's most famous cold cases has headlines swirling			2
so , what 's the story this time ? @entity3 was the 9 - year - old brother of @entity8 who , by all accounts , slept soundly in his room that @entity31 in 1996 while his sister 's skull was fractured and she was strangled elsewhere in the house			1
now , he 's 23 , and although police investigators are n't talking , the family 's lawyer is			1
@entity19 said police investigators approached @entity3 on his college campus in the spring , gave him a business card and said that if he wanted to talk about the case , they 'd like to hear from him			1
investigators , no doubt , are hoping that locked in @entity3 's memory is some clue that could crack the case ; maybe it 's a detail that he was afraid to mention as a child or as a teenager but that he now wants to discuss			1
but police will have to keep waiting			2
@entity19 says his client has declined their latest request to talk			1
good for him , say some journalists and legal analysts in the @entity6 foothills who have long followed the story			0
" @entity3 has been completely cleared , " said @entity58 attorney @entity57 , who has no direct involvement with the case but has been sharply critical of how authorities have handled it			1
" the @entity5 police engaged in a crime scene search and preservation that was worse than amateurish			2
it borders on criminal , " @entity57 said			0
the police have always defended their work on the case , but despite all the scrutiny , all the hours of investigation , nothing came of their efforts			2
it 's hard to remember now , but the death of @entity8 was little more than a tragic local news story that holiday season until her parents appeared on @entity0			1
@entity78 and @entity79 turned the story into a sensation when @entity79 , crying and shaking , told the nation : " there 's a killer on the loose			2
i do n't know who it is			0
i do n't know if it 's a she or a he , but if i were a resident of @entity5 , i would tell my friends to keep your babies close to you			0
there 's someone out there			0
" the interview unleashed the now famous pageant video , the disquieting cheesecake photos of @entity8 and a national debate : how could a 6 - year - old girl be killed in a quiet neighborhood , and no one see or hear a thing ? the early evidence seemed to point toward the parents			1
there was no sign of forced entry into the @entity3 home , no footprints in the snow surrounding it			1
the rope used to choke @entity8 was tightened with a paintbrush from her mother 's hobby kit			1
an alleged ransom note ( remember , this was first thought to be a kidnapping ) was written on a pad of paper from inside the house , and some investigators thought the handwriting looked like @entity79 's			0
it contained details about the family 's past and finances that few outside their close circle could have known			1
and the body was found in a little - used basement room that police did n't even notice at first			0
investigative reporter @entity134 , who tracked the case all those years ago , said people were asking how a stranger could have pulled it off			0
" it 's sort of like a puzzle , " she said			0
" how do you put all of those pieces together ? was it an intruder ? if it was n't an intruder , how on @entity147 did this happen ? but on the other hand , how could somebody do that to their own child ? it 's got to be one or the other , you know ? somebody killed @entity8			1
" the @entity158 ramped up public suspicion , whether they meant to or not , when they hired lawyers and a publicist			0
their relationship with investigators grew noticeably strained			0
each possible break in the case , each supposed suspect over the years , proved worthless or a fraud			0
two years ago , the district attorney said that new dna testing methods had cleared all family members of suspicion			1
" we 're certainly grateful for an acknowledgement that we are innocent , this was an intruder , which of course we 've always maintained			0
" yet here investigators are , once again , knocking on @entity3 's door			1
attorney @entity179 , who has closely watched the case , said that even if @entity8 's brother knows something , so what ? " even if @entity3 were to have some miraculous memory that could lead to the arrest of a suspect , that information would be so dated and so questionable that most criminal defense attorneys would have a heyday with it at trial , " @entity179 said			1
" it 's very problematic to be using information that would be so stale from an individual who did not remember it before			0
" the main adult figures in the @entity3 case are almost all gone -- to other jobs ; other cities			2
some , including @entity79 , have died			0
they leave behind unanswered questions and one terrible fact : a 6 - year - old girl was killed , and 14 years later , no one has spent even a day in jail for her murder			0
like many who have followed the @entity3 case from the start , @entity179 doubts the killing will ever be solved			2
" the colder the case gets , the colder the trail gets			0
