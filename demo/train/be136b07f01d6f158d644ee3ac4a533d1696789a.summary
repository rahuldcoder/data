-- the uncertainty that confronts consumers and investors in the @entity4 is staggering			0
there 's the price of gasoline , which creeps higher almost daily ; a housing market that month after month gets gloomier and gloomier ; and the conflict in @entity10 that has cost the @entity4 an estimated $ 3 trillion			0
is it any wonder that the @entity13 -- maybe the most telling measure of how rank - and - file consumers view their economic health both present and future -- is at a five - year low ? @entity20 executives thinks the @entity22 release could net them $ 100 million in one week			1

" one industry analyst , @entity92 ' @entity91 , forecasts growth for the company that builds even further on those enviable figures			0
" accelerating demand for next - gen hardware including the @entity103 should benefit comparable store sales in the [ present ] period , " @entity91 said of the company , who added it is not just demand , but broad demand which is fueling @entity20 growth			2
success for @entity20 is " highly attributable to video game play attracting a mainstream audience , " with the demographic expansion having much to do with " new consoles like the @entity109 , which pull back on the geekish complexity of typical content aimed at hardcore gamers			1
" but it 's really the library of upcoming games that will supply @entity20 with most of its revenue infusion in 2008			2
@entity91 said today he expects that the release of @entity22 could net the company more than $ 100 million -- in a single week			1

" from every vantage point , the year is shaping up to be one of record - setting revenues and profit for @entity20 -- with more than just insiders noting the potential			1
today on @entity157 , investors clamored for @entity20 shares , bidding up the price just a nickel shy of $ 4 , or almost 8 percent , to $ 55.66			1
