-- let 's all stop for moment , catch our breath and take in the magnitude of what is happening			1
before we jump from campaign frenzy to post-election celebration -- or disappointment -- we should not let @entity9 pass without pausing to really absorb what an extraordinary thing democracy is			1
the idea that the people have a right to decide who will govern them , that the men and women who want to become president have to undergo a grueling , months - long job application process , engaging with citizens , trying to persuade everyone , rich and poor , young , old , men , women -- everyone -- that they deserve the position , is a truly remarkable reality			1
it is also a contagious idea that has spilled across the surface of the @entity29 like water seeking its natural level			1
but it is not a self - occurring , automatic state of affairs			0
over the centuries , the strong simply seized power , and the masses regularly endured unjust rule			0
democracy has come because of enormous effort and sacrifice			1
and in too many places , many are still struggling , even dying , to claim it as their own			0
@entity45 's democracy is flawed , yes			1
but it is nowhere near so flawed as to be rendered meaningless or beyond repair			0
president @entity48 : my vision for @entity45 those who have spent their whole lives living under a democracy , or who have never witnessed the passion with which those living without it can yearn for a legitimate government , may not grasp just how stunning it is for all the people to have the power to choose their government			1
history , even recent and still - unfolding history , is filled with examples of dictatorship and tyranny			0
and it is rich with stories of courageous efforts to bring it down			0
no one who remembers what happened in @entity72 in 1989 can take democracy for granted			1
hundreds of thousands of students took over @entity75 , erecting their crude styrofoam and papier mache replica of the @entity79 , the @entity80 they called it , smack in front of the giant portrait of @entity84			1
they declared that the goddess announced to the world that , " a consciousness of democracy has awakened among the @entity72 people ! the new era has begun			1
" it was not to be			0
within four days , army tanks trampled the statue , along with hundreds , perhaps thousands of demonstrators			0
today , the article you are reading now may not appear on @entity100 searches in @entity72 , which block the word " @entity102 , " along with efforts to bring democracy			2
and who can forget the first multiracial election in @entity107 ? that day in 1994 , voters lined up for miles as far as the eye could see , some waiting as long as 12 hours to cast their vote			1
the winner was @entity114 , revered to this day as a symbol of equality , reconciliation , non-violence and an unbending determination to make the privilege of democracy apply to all the people			2
@entity123 : my vision for @entity45 the passion for democracy among those who do n't enjoy it can seem naive to those who have seen its flaws			1
i remember interviewing women in @entity134 seeking the right to vote in that emirate 's very limited democracy			1
what if after gaining the vote they would not make any progress , i asked			0
their answer revealed complete faith that democracy would bring the best outcome			2
then we just have to work better , harder , to explain our positions to voters , they said			0
more recently , the images from @entity152 in @entity153 inspired the world , as @entity155 sought to overthrow a decades - old dictatorship as part of a wave of revolutions across the region			0
we have followed with nervousness the unfolding uprisings in other parts of the @entity164 , wondering whether democracy will emerge victorious			2
not everyone who fights against the existing tyranny seeks democracy			2
there are those who would like to impose their own ideas of how the people should be ruled			0
21 moments that defined the campaigns after all , we now accept as obvious the belief spelled out in the @entity176 that governments derive their power from the consent of the governed			2
but that is truly a revolutionary vision , one that turns the concept of power on its head			0
in fact , it is a majestic idea , one that seems so romantic as to appear utopian , unreachable			2
and it is certainly not easy to achieve in all its fullness			0
it 's worth remembering that the proposition does not refer just to elections			1
choosing a president and other representatives of the people to govern is just the first step			2
the true objective of the exercise is to establish a government that will work for the benefit of society or , as @entity206 so perfectly expressed it , " a government of the people , by the people , for the people			1
" for a reminder of how drastically different this could be , think back to the start of the @entity212 revolutions , when @entity213 , an impoverished @entity215 fruit vendor trying desperately to make ends meet , set himself on fire after an official capriciously confiscated his fruit cart and weighing scales			0
your take : should we have polling places in churches ? it means that after a government takes the reins , the country has a right to expect it to function for the benefit of the nation ; that when the government fails , the people have a right to be outraged and demand results			1
in a few hours , the polls will close across the @entity45 , results will begin pouring in and a large part of the population will feel deeply , painfully , angrily disappointed , while a slightly larger portion will burst into celebration ( unless the election brings another excruciating delayed decision )			0
so , let 's pause briefly to experience a sense of awe for the system			1
after that , the time will be right for a new push to repair its many flaws			0
@entity253 : our voting system is a disgrace the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity259 .			0

@entity261 : pause to marvel at democracy , where governed choose their *leader*
she says idea contagious , points to @entity75 , @entity107 , @entity268
she says elections only first step ; idea is a government that works for society 's benefit
@entity277 : at election , *reflect* on majesty of process , then get to working to fix its flaws
