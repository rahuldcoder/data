-- one investigative tip can lead to another -- and another			1
@entity3 , a genealogy gumshoe , went to @entity5 to match handwriting samples			1
she spent a couple weeks in @entity7 following a tip , only to find it was just hearsay			1
over the years , @entity10 has beckoned , too			1
such are the destinations of the forensic genealogist who has used streetwise skills and her curiosity to dig a little deeper into the lives of the eight - man crew of the legendary @entity17 , the first submarine to bring down an enemy ship			1
the crew did n't live to tell the story			1
the @entity22 went to its watery tomb within an hour of its triumph -- if not much sooner			1
how was historic @entity26 submarine lost ? for @entity28 , it 's a world of win some , lose some and tangling with seeming dead ends			1
" i do n't think my part will ever be done			1
this was a tough case , " says @entity28 , who lives in western @entity34 and has worked with the @entity35 for more than a dozen years			2
just how tough ? consider this : -- only one crew member on the @entity41 submarine was believed to have had children , and a descendant living in @entity44 has little source material about him			1
-- four were @entity46 - born			2
( how researchers found that out is a fascinating tidbit )			2
-- only one , @entity17 , has been positively identified through dna			2
-- there are no known photos of any of the eight			2
@entity28 and other such researchers ca n't afford to be happy with what is " known " about an individual			2
in the @entity60 's case , that was precious little when they began			2
the hunt is about following a trail , following another -- and not being afraid to venture into a rabbit hole			2
the genealogist was to discuss her latest findings saturday evening during a program at the @entity69 in @entity70 , @entity71			1
monday marks the 150th anniversary of the @entity22 's attack during the @entity26			1
the lab houses the @entity17 , which has been undergoing conservation treatment since it was raised a few miles off @entity76 in 2000			2
it also has facial reconstructions of the crew and summaries of what is known about each			1
monday evening , a memorial service on the tip of @entity85 will remember the 13 men who died that night : the eight on the @entity17 and five on its prey , the @entity88			1
true romance , or just a fun legend ? lt. @entity91 , captain of the @entity17 , typifies ongoing challenges for scientists and historians			1
a gold coin and a diamond ring and brooch were found with his remains			1
" @entity91 is still a mystery			2
here is a guy making a mark for himself in the world , with some personal wealth , " says @entity100 , head of underwater archeology for the @entity102 and former director of the @entity35			2
" where he came from , and his family , is a bit of mystery			2
" @entity28 says the lieutenant was a riverman possibly from @entity113 or @entity114			2
she spent time doing research in @entity7 , but never was able to make a connection to a tip regarding @entity91			2
today , he has no verified descendants			2
what he does have is a story that has become a legend of sorts			0
the gold coin he carried to his doom reportedly was given as a charm by his sweetheart , @entity126			1
the $ 20 piece deflected a @entity129 bullet during the @entity130 and saved @entity91 's life			0
he had the reverse side of the talisman engraved with the words , " @entity135			0
" the @entity137 story has never been proven ; a supposed photo of the blond , blue - eyed @entity91 did not match his skull			0
and the photo , along with letters about the supposed relationship , have disappeared			0
" officially , i can not prove or disprove " the romantic tale , says @entity144 , executive director of the @entity145			1
" it makes for a really good story			0
the @entity22 is one of those ( in which ) you can not pin it down			1
" ' that leads to more leads ' tests on the well - preserved skeletal remains showed the men to range in age from their late teens to mid- 40s			1
some had teeth that bore hallmarks of prolific pipe smoking			0
" the ( @entity22 ) @entity164 was sure these were ... southern boys from @entity71 and @entity44 , " says @entity28			1
instead , carbon isotope analysis revealed that four crew members were from @entity46			1
the tests showed a diet rich in corn for the @entity171 and a wheat - based diet for the @entity46			0
@entity28 , who also does contract genealogical research for the @entity174 , says work on the @entity17 provides inspiration and motivation to fill in gaps about the crew			1
for example , two members -- @entity182 and @entity183 -- are known only by their last names			0
experts were able to verify the identity , and correct spelling of @entity17 's uncommon last name , through careful research of enlistment papers and dna analysis			0
@entity28 learned that the eastern @entity193 sailor had two sisters buried in @entity113			0
after permission was granted , a grave was exhumed and a dna sample was taken from one sister 's jawbone			0
she also researched two men from a @entity10 artillery unit based in @entity76			1
they were late substitutes on the @entity22 crew			1
the genealogist says she is impressed by @entity91 's charisma and his ability to recruit crew members for the @entity22 , which lost 13 men in previous operations			1
" he was really gung - ho and believed that he would make a difference , that he would finally have success			0
it is like listening to a new boss at your company and how it makes you feel			0
" her research , meanwhile , goes on			0
" you find these things that begin to create a picture , a story of these guys , " @entity28 says			0
" and then that leads to more leads			0
" @entity229 - born seaman @entity17 is the only @entity17 crew member known to marry and have children			1
@entity232 served on a @entity129 vessel before jumping ship to fight for the @entity71			1
@entity235 , a great - great granddaughter who lives in suburban @entity236 , says her family , unfortunately , has few records and no " personal stories " that were passed down			0
still , she takes pride in the dangerous mission @entity232 undertook on the @entity17			0
" this was very risky and he knew it			0
" @entity245 and about 25 relatives attended the april 2004 funeral in @entity76 for the eight , who are buried near the remains of the two @entity17 crews that died in previous mishaps			0
recognizing sacrifice of those who wore blue , gray @entity256 , on @entity85 , is the location for monday night 's memorial service for those who died on the @entity17 and @entity88			0
breathtaking views from the sanctuary 's windows include @entity263 , where the @entity22 began its mission on february 17 , 1864			1
" what is really unique is that it is a recognition of a sacrifice that took place on both sides of the conflict , " says the rev. @entity265			0
as a bell is tolled for each victim , a carnation will be handed to a woman dressed in black , 13 in all , representing family members of the lost			0
sitting near them are re-enactors dressed in either blue or gray			0
a group of submariners from recent decades participate in the service , linking the past to the present			0
" this was an @entity171 conflict and everyone gathered here are @entity171			0
one of the great themes ... is that we are making sense out of a very divisive conflict , " says the @entity290			0
members of the @entity296 will conduct a procession -- led by bagpipers -- from the church to the inlet , where flowers and memorial wreaths are placed in the water			0
" it is done with a lot of dignity and with honor , for both crews , " says @entity304 , the organization 's president			0
piece of @entity26 ironclad brought to surface what caused the @entity314 to go down ? @entity315 from @entity317 's sunken ship : five huge cannons ghostly underwater art gallery breathes new life to sunken ship			1
