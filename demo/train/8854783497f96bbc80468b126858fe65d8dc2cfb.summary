the " world 's most wanted man " may be holed up in @entity0 , but @entity2 's story will soon be available -- as they say -- everywhere books are sold			1
" the @entity7 : the @entity11 , " by reporter @entity12 , from the @entity8 newspaper @entity13 , comes out in the @entity8 this week , with a @entity10 release date of february 11			1
the @entity13 is a key player in the @entity2 saga , having provided an outlet for the former @entity18 contractor - turned - whistle - blower to expose what he knew about the @entity10 government 's mass surveillance programs			1
@entity12 accessed a wealth of inside information , such as this story about how @entity2 first connected via e-mail with @entity13 journalist @entity27			1
@entity12 writes in the book : " this mystery correspondent asked @entity27 to install @entity31 encryption software on his laptop			1
once up and running , it guarantees privacy ( the initials stand for @entity31 ) for an online chat			2
but there were two problems			0
' i 'm basically technically illiterate , ' he admits			0
@entity27 also had a lingering sense that the kind of person who insisted on encryption might turn out to be slightly crazy			0
" @entity27 and @entity2 eventually built a mutual trust , and the former it contractor divulged many of the top secret documents in his possession			1
at that point , @entity13 's @entity10 editor @entity51 drew up plan before publishing , including seeking legal advice and working out a strategy for approaching the @entity57			1
she had some tough decisions to make			0
@entity12 wrote : " @entity59 decided to give the @entity18 a four - hour window to comment , so the agency had an opportunity to disavow the story			1
by @entity8 standards , the deadline was fair : long enough to make a few calls , agree a line			1
but for @entity70 , where journalist - administration relations sometimes resemble a country club , this was nothing short of outrageous			0
" @entity12 said @entity59 's tough decisions meant she 'd have to face down some tough people , including @entity77 deputy director @entity76 , @entity18 deputy director @entity78 , and @entity79 , general counsel for the @entity80			1
the author writes : " by fielding heavyweights , the @entity57 had perhaps reckoned it could flatter , and if necessary bully , the @entity13 into delaying publication			2
@entity59 explained that the editor - in - chief -- in the air halfway across the @entity87 -- was unavailable			0
she said : ' i 'm the final decision - maker			0
' after 20 minutes , the @entity57 was frustrated			0
the conversation was going in circles			0
finally , one of the team could take no more			0
losing his temper , he shouted , ' you do n't need to publish this ! no serious news organisation would publish this ! ' @entity59 replied , ' with the greatest respect , we will take the decisions about what we publish			0
' " the newspaper ran the story and , soon thereafter , @entity2 disappeared			2
he 's currently in @entity0 , where he has asylum			2
" i think ... he 's achieved far more than he could have possibly imagined when he was sitting in @entity107 planning this leak , " @entity12 told @entity106 on sunday			1
he described @entity2 's transformation from contractor to leaker			1
in other words , the more information he saw about what he viewed as ... mass surveillance , the more disillusioned he became			0
he says quite explicitly that he thought that ( president @entity118 ) @entity118 would roll back some of these programs when he came into the @entity57 , and when this did n't happen , essentially @entity2 decided he would take things into his own hands , and become a whistle - blower , " he author said			2
" there 's no doubt that he 's changed history by what he 's done			2

the book , by @entity13 reporter @entity12 , will be released in the @entity8 this week
it details the unlikely journey of intelligence leaker @entity2
harding on @entity2 : " he 's achieved far more than he could have possibly imagined "
