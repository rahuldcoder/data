, but there have been few attempts to scratch the surface of their everyday life beyond the construction sites			0
a new documentary that opened in @entity5 cinemas this week is hoping to change all that			1
" @entity27 " chronicles an annual singing competition that takes place in @entity5 's labor camps			1
like many of the city 's migrant workers , the subjects put up with long working days , relative isolation and inhospitable weather so they can send money back home ; sometimes to children awaiting school fees or daughters awaiting dowries			1
" @entity44 " ( the @entity46 name applied to the contest ) offers them a rare bit of respite and the chance to earn cash prizes			2
" the money i send back home to my family is how they make ends meet			1
it has n't been easy ; sometimes i feel i have no life , " admits one contestant featured in the film			0
@entity57 is the official sponsor of the competition			1
according to @entity60 , the managing director at @entity61 , the advertising agency that set up the contest , the @entity59 represents one of the largest markets for the money transfer firm			1
many laborers use their services bi-monthly to send remittances			1
" while there 's not a commercial angle to the contest , it does help build loyalty with the brand , " @entity69 admits			1
" people ( in the camps ) might trust the brand a little bit more now that it 's closer to them			2
" likened to " @entity81 " with a @entity46 twist , @entity27 has become increasingly popular over the years			0
when it launched in 2006 , only 100 contenders auditioned			0
last year , 3,000 applied			0
first - place winners take home aed10 , 000 ( $ 2,722 ) , other contestants can win items like tvs and home appliances			2
though the subject of labor camps can be somewhat touchy in @entity5 , with many expats living comparatively gilded lives at the expense of the city 's migrant workers , there seems to be a lot of curiosity about how these men -- squirreled away into tower blocks on the fringes of the city -- live their daily lives			1
more than 1,200 viewers turned up at the film 's premiere at the @entity108			2
" the @entity5 public has a curiosity about the men who built the city for them , " explains @entity109 , the film 's director			1
" many people live here for years and enjoy the champagne lifestyle without ever knowing how the other half have come to be here or what kind of lives they have , " he adds			0
one of the more touching story lines in the film follows @entity124 , a @entity125 worker who helped construct the @entity126			0
" he could always see it in the remote distance , but he never walked along the fountains , or enjoyed its restaurants or went up to see its viewing deck , " says @entity109 , who took him back to the site during filming			0
" he stared at the tower and gave a really poignant reflection on what life in the @entity126 might be like compared to life in the camps			2
it was one of the critical scenes in the movie , and it really excited viewers			2
" at the end of the premiere , movie 's characters took to the stage and performed a live concert , eliciting a standing ovation from the crowd			1
in a rare moment of engagement , many viewers hugged the participants and posed in photos with them			0
despite the movie 's popularity and critical acclaim , the journey from film festival to cinemas has been a financial struggle , and unless @entity109 gets more funding for his project , the likelihood it will last past this week is remote			1
" the @entity59 is a tremendously expensive place to film , " says @entity168 , the film 's producer			2
" we were able to get a couple of grants , but otherwise , the entire thing came out of our own pockets			0
" in hopes of raising enough money for marketing and distribution , @entity168 and @entity109 have launched a crowd - funding campaign through aflamnah , a @entity184 version of @entity185			0
" we want the general public to hear the laborers tell their stories and to know who they are , but we also want to invite further pondering about the labor camp institutions , " says @entity109			0
" we hope we cracked a dialogue that 's going to go a bit further now that the film has hit cinemas			0
