@entity0 -- @entity4 's prince @entity3 and his wife @entity5 are expecting their first child after 19 months of marriage , the palace announced monday			1
but until 2011 , any daughter born to the @entity10 and @entity5 would not have enjoyed an equal right to inherit the @entity4 throne			1
rules dating back centuries decree that the crown passes to the eldest son and is only bestowed on a daughter when there are no sons			1
all this changed at an october 2011 meeting of the leaders of 16 @entity24 countries in @entity25 , @entity26 , where they unanimously agreed to amend the succession rules			1
@entity1 examines the background to a controversial and long - running debate			0
latest : @entity3 and @entity30 expecting royal child what prompted the change ? the issue has been discussed in the @entity4 for many years -- and changes have been proposed before -- but it requires an act of parliament and the agreement of the 15 other realms where @entity4 royalty is the head of state to alter the rules of succession			1
successive @entity4 governments have failed to find parliamentary time to debate proposals to change the law			2
a spokesman at @entity4 prime minister @entity49 's office said it had often been thought of as " too thorny and complicated to deal with quickly			0
" the marriage of @entity3 and @entity30 in april 2011 brought the issue back into focus			1
@entity49 referred directly to the couple in his speech to @entity24 leaders , saying the succession rules were " outdated			2
" " the idea that a younger son should become monarch instead of an elder daughter simply because he 's a man ... this way of thinking is at odds with the modern countries that we 've all become , " he said			0
@entity67 to royal couple : congrats ! so what was agreed ? the leaders of the 16 @entity24 countries that have @entity73 as head of state unanimously agreed that sons and daughters of @entity4 monarchs will have an equal right to the throne			1
they also agreed that a future @entity4 monarch can marry a @entity80 -- something that is currently banned			1
what was the historical basis for the old rules ? the tradition of favoring the male heir -- called male primogeniture -- goes back many centuries and can be seen in the extensive family tree of the @entity4 monarchy			2
but a key law which governs the way @entity4 monarchs are chosen is the 1701 @entity93 which has its roots in the religious strife of the age			1
the official @entity98 website explains that the act was designed to secure the protestant succession to the throne			0
royal commentator and former editor of the @entity105 , @entity104 , explained that this has been a divisive issue ever since the @entity108 king henry viii split with the @entity80 in @entity109 in the 16th century , leading to decades of religious persecution			0
the @entity93 decreed that no @entity80 or anyone married to a @entity80 could hold the @entity113 crown			2
this is now to be amended so that an heir to the throne can still be monarch even if they marry a @entity80			1
the @entity98 website gives two examples of the current royal family who were removed from the line of succession because they married @entity80 -- @entity123 , @entity124 , and prince @entity125			2
how are @entity3 and @entity30 affected ? the changes mean that if the couple 's first born is a girl , she will eventually become queen			1
previously , a younger son would have taken precedence			0
however , this could be many years in the future			0
prince @entity135 is first in line to the throne when @entity73 dies , and his son @entity3 would ascend after his reign			2
@entity49 's speech makes it clear that the new rules are not retroactive , so prince @entity135 's eldest sibling , @entity143 , will not be in line to the throne in front of her younger brothers @entity148 and @entity149			0
it also means that any heir born to the @entity10 and @entity5 can marry a @entity80 and retain the crown			2
what is n't changing ? the @entity4 sovereign is also head of the @entity156 -- part of the @entity158 -- and retains the title @entity159			0
@entity49 said at the 2011 meeting that " the monarch must be in communion with the @entity156 because he or she is the head of that church			0
" this would currently bar a @entity80 holding the crown			1
prince @entity135 caused controversy in 1994 when he said in a tv interview that he would rather be seen as " defender of faiths " to include @entity80 subjects of the sovereign which he described as " equally as important as the @entity158 ones or the protestant ones			0
" he went on to list other faiths as also being equally important			0
what happens next ? @entity49 explained in his speech to @entity24 leaders that " for historic reasons " the @entity4 legislation needed to be published first but the necessary measures would be implemented at the same time across the @entity24			1
however , the process is a complex one			0
the @entity187 spokesman said that in addition to the @entity93 , many other archaic laws would have to be amended -- these include the @entity190 , the @entity191 , the acts of @entity193 and the @entity194 1772			0
each of the 15 other @entity24 members would then have to amend their own legislation			2
so which countries are affected ? the @entity24 consists of 54 independent states , most of which have ties to the @entity4 , but @entity73 is head of state to only 16 of them including the @entity4			1
those nations are @entity205 and @entity206 , @entity26 , @entity207 , @entity208 , @entity209 , @entity210 , @entity211 , @entity212 , @entity213 , @entity214 , @entity215 and @entity216 , @entity217 , @entity218 and the @entity219 , @entity220 , and @entity221 .			0

the marriage of @entity3 and @entity30 brought the succession back into focus
sons and daughters of @entity4 monarchs will now have an equal right to the throne
@entity80 are still barred from holding the crown
both the @entity4 laws and those of 15 other @entity24 states will have to be amended
