@entity0 was one of the defining personalities of the 20th century			1
in diplomacy , economics , society and as a woman , she had enormous impact at home and abroad			0
the test of a statesman is whether he or she changes the political weather			0
@entity0 , who won an unprecedented three consecutive general elections , certainly did that as @entity15 prime minister from 1979 to 1990			1
what do you think about the loss of @entity15 's ' @entity19 ' ? share your thoughts on @entity21 but @entity0 not only changed the philosophy of her own party , the right - leaning conservatives , she also forced other parties to change their whole approach to politics			1
since @entity0 , all @entity15 mainstream parties have been believers , more or less , in the market economy			1
no other @entity15 politician during the second half of the 20th century had his or her own " ism " -- but @entity0 did with " @entity34 , " defined by some as the application of a housewife 's home budgeting to the national economy , coupled with the encouragement of home ownership and entrepreneurial capitalism			1
her first achievement , easily forgotten now , was to go as far as she did in politics as a woman : she was , after all , the @entity15 's first female prime minister			1
it was much harder then , and the best she had hoped for when she started her political career was to become chief finance minister as chancellor of the exchequer			0
when she entered 10 @entity53 , the prime minister 's official residence , @entity0 headed a @entity54 in which most ministers had voted for her predecessor @entity56			1
soon , in scribbled comments on the margins of @entity54 papers , the prime minister derided as " wets " those fellow ministers who were aghast at the budgets driven through by herself and chancellor @entity65			1
her colleagues and advisers told her that she could not reform the trades ' unions that had brought the country to its knees during the 1970s through industrial action and seen off the previous @entity25 government			0
only governments run by @entity75 - the @entity25 ' main rivals for power -- could do that , they said			0
but @entity0 brought the unions under control and no government since has reversed the measures she took			2
diplomats and ambassadors told her she could not get back from the @entity84 what she liked to refer to as " our money , " the contribution paid by the @entity15 as part of its membership of @entity91			2
but @entity0 " handbagged " her way through @entity91 summits till the @entity15 secured a unique budget rebate which no prime minister has dared to negotiate away ever since			1
unafraid to go to war , at home and in the @entity98 above all , advisers told her there was no prospect of fighting a far - away war and winning back the @entity98 after @entity104 's invasion in 1982 -- but she did			0
as the late @entity107 diplomat @entity106 later confirmed , it was @entity110 officials ' fear of her personal wrath which brought crucial intelligence help from @entity107			0
with her program of selling off homes rented to tenants by regional councils and the privatization of state - controlled industries , @entity0 founded popular capitalism in @entity15			1
nobody would understand what was meant by " @entity122 " or " @entity123 " or even " @entity124 , " all creeds associated with previous prime ministers			0
but the @entity15 people still have a clear idea of what @entity34 was all about			2
@entity0 took power in a period when most commentators and politicians had accepted that the only role for @entity15 was the least painful management possible of gentle decline			1
instead , she restored a sense of national pride and purpose , enabling @entity15 to continue punching above its weight in international affairs			2
by taking on the power of the trades ' unions , many say she gave managements back the power to manage			0
but in her revolutionary march through the institutions of @entity15 society , she did n't go as far as many @entity0 zealots would have liked , especially when it came to introducing the open market to health and education services			1
watch : @entity158 clouds @entity0 's legacy soviets respected her as ' @entity162 ' overseas , @entity0 became a true power broker on the international scene , seeing @entity166 's president @entity165 as a man with whom she could " do business " and re-charging her ideological batteries in exchanges with @entity110 president @entity172			2
the " @entity19 , " as the @entity175 media christened her , became a world figure			0
her fondness for @entity172 did not stop her bawling him out in 1983 when he allowed @entity110 forces to invade @entity179 , a member of the @entity181 , or telling him off for ( in her view ) conceding too much to @entity165 in arms negotiations			0
but she engendered respect rather than love , especially when she fought the rest of the @entity181 by opposing economic sanctions against the apartheid regime in @entity189			0
the authority she gained did not mean there were not mistakes along the way			0
some economists blame her governments for wrecking @entity15 manufacturing			2
they say it was under @entity0 's financial ministers that chronic underspending on @entity15 's public services created problems that are still being rectified today			1
critics contend that hers was not a tolerant society and she ensured that @entity15 's role in @entity91 become that of permanent irritant rather than profitable partner			1
aided and abetted by sections of the media , it seemed @entity0 came to believe in the myth of her own invincibility			2
that was what led her into mistakes including the poll tax -- a charge that saw dukes and domestic cleaners paying the same local dues -- and increasingly shrill anti-europeanism , which alarmed even her own party and eventually led them to discard a leader who had won them three consecutive elections			0
@entity110 political figures react to @entity0 's death proud but isolated @entity0 's vote - winning drive had forced @entity15 's other parties to change their thinking to remain in touch with the electorate			1
but when the poll tax - a levy on individuals -- and her " no , no , no " response to @entity91 frightened her party into dumping her in 1990 , they woke up the next morning and felt guilty about what they had done to their one - time heroine			0
many @entity245 then adopted @entity247 - skepticism as a badge of loyalty to the discarded leader and made the party virtually unleadable under @entity0 's successor @entity252			1
as her friend the novelist @entity254 put it , this turned the @entity25 into the only known example of a " circular firing squad			0
" the appealing certainties of a " conviction politician " had turned a party that had been interested previously in the gaining and retention of power into an ideological sect more concerned with winning arguments than elections			0
during @entity0 's party leadership she purged her team of moderates who backed previous leaders like @entity56 as well as other doubters			2
she quarreled with other strong figures like chancellor @entity275 and leadership rival @entity276 , and she sought compliant government officials , inquiring in advance of key @entity280 appointments : " is he one of us ? " by the time she fell out with @entity65 , provoking him to deliver a ministerial resignation speech which began her own downfall , he was the only survivor of her first @entity54			0
@entity0 's strength and drive made her an icon to conservatives in many parts of the world , especially in eastern @entity91			1
she possessed the certainties of a tabloid newspaper editor , and her eagerness to see the power of central government reduced even made her a heroine to some of today 's @entity299 enthusiasts in the @entity110			2
few @entity91 politicians since have been so capable of drawing an @entity110 audience			0
the irony though is that while her election results show the pull she exerted through her strong leadership , her populist streak and her raising of the @entity15 profile , many @entity15 never really identified with the underlying values of the woman who became , both in her time as prime minister and in the years to come , a national icon .			1

@entity0 was the @entity15 's first female prime minister
she had changed the philosophy of the conservatives as well other parties
@entity0 founded popular capitalism in @entity15
her strength made her an icon to conservatives in many parts of the world
