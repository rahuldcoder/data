-- january can be a grueling month			2
@entity1 is but a distant memory , with the only reminder of the festive period the credit card bills which keep tumbling through the letter box			0
it is often a time for cutting ones cloth as once profligate football clubs are finding out , though the likes of @entity12 club @entity10 have gone on a spending spree in a desperate bid to avoid relegation			2
@entity12 clubs splashed out a combined £ 120 million ( $ 190 million ) on new players during the january transfer window -- double the £ 60m spent during the same period in 2012 -- but those figures can be deceptive , with @entity10 , @entity20 and @entity22 accounting for over half of the money spent in @entity26 's top flight			1
but , in truth , the increase in spending contradicts the mood of austerity which is blowing like tumbleweed through @entity34 soccer			1
" there were relatively few active spenders in the winter window , with over half of this january 's total transfer spending coming from three clubs , " said @entity38 , partner in the sports business group at @entity40 , as he analyzed spending trends in the @entity12			1
" @entity45 window activity tends to be driven by the on - pitch competition at the upper and lower ends of the @entity12 table			0
" the elephant in every club boardroom is the need to factor in @entity34 governing body @entity52 's new financial rules that are designed to prevent big spending clubs spending beyond their means and posting unsustainable yearly losses			0
" clubs are now in a reporting period that will count towards the first assessment of @entity52 's financial fair play break - even requirement for international competition and @entity12 clubs are also considering the implementation of additional cost control regulation at a domestic level , " added @entity38			1
" their apparent relative restraint in this transfer window may reflect an increasing focus on clubs achieving more sustainable levels of expenditure relative to revenues			1
" like @entity10 , the motivation for @entity22 , currently 15th in the table , to bring in reinforcements was to ensure @entity12 survival			0
and the arrival of the cavalry at both clubs is already starting to have an effect			0
@entity84 striker @entity83 scored on his debut for @entity10 in a 1 - 1 draw with @entity87 , while @entity22 's new @entity89 midfielder @entity88 dominated the game during tuesday 's 2 - 0 win at relegation rivals @entity92 , who preferred a strategy of financial prudence , which may yet backfire			0
@entity12 survival is more important than ever this term , with a record - breaking television deal set to offer clubs and unprecedented bounty next season			0
" @entity12 clubs have been relatively restrained in their player transfer fee spending , in spite of the upcoming uplift in their broadcasting revenues of between £ 20m and £ 30m each from next season , " added @entity38			2
" whilst the clubs ' total spending was £ 120m , after taking into account transfer income , the @entity12 clubs ' net transfer spend was £ 70m			1
" the transfer window system has been in place across @entity34 since 2003			1
in 11 january windows , @entity26 clubs have traditionally outspent their continental rivals , and the trend continued in 2013			1
the second highest spending league this january was @entity120 's @entity119 , which spent roughly 70 % of the @entity12 's total			2
the most high - profile of those transfers was that of controversial striker @entity124 , who joined @entity125 from @entity26 champions @entity126			0
spending in @entity84 and @entity127 was dwarfed by that in @entity26 and @entity120			0
the total amount spent in both countries was between 30 and 45 % of that recorded in @entity26 , with an exodus of players across the @entity134 the trend during @entity84 's transfer window			1
one @entity26 who bucked the trend was soccer icon @entity138 , who joined @entity139 on a deal which will see his wages donated to a local childrens ' charity .			0

@entity26 clubs topped spend during the january transfer window
january is one of two periods of the year when @entity34 soccer clubs can *buy* players
@entity12 teams spent $ 190 million on players throughout the month
the figure is double the amount spent in the same period last year
