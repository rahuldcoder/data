@entity2 @entity0 have discovered a 50 - foot " dragon " dinosaur species in @entity4 that may have roamed the earth 160 million years ago during the @entity6			1
the long skeleton was found in 2006 by farmers digging for a fish pond in @entity11 in the southwestern @entity13 province			1
@entity14 , a member of the research team from the @entity16 who made the discovery , told @entity1 it was named @entity19 , the " dragon of @entity11 " because farmers thought the bones resembled the shape of @entity4 mythical dragons			2
" we found the dinosaur 's huge vertebrae with the skull and the tail , but could n't find any bones from the hands or the legs			2
so the locals began to say the long body looked just like a dragon from ancient @entity4 stories , " said @entity33			2
the findings , published earlier this week in the @entity39 , show that the new species belongs to a group of dinosaurs called mamenchisaurids , known for their extremely long necks , which would measure up to half their body length			1
most sauropods , or long - necked dinosaurs , such as those depicted in the popular animated series , " @entity50 , " have necks that span only one third of their body length			1
" @entity55 is a cool animal			0
if you imagine a big animal that is half neck , you can see that evolution can do quite extraordinary things , " @entity56 , a phd student at the @entity16 , said in a press release			0
the dinosaur is the youngest addition to the mamenchisaurid group , which is only found in @entity65			0
the discovery suggests that there may be other species of long - necks within the genus from different continents			1
" @entity55 shows that long - necked dinosaurs diversified in unique ways in @entity65 during @entity76 times -- something very special was going on in that continent , " said @entity56			1
" nowhere else we can find dinosaurs with longer necks than those in @entity4			0
the new dinosaur tells us that these extreme species thrived in isolation from the rest of the world			0
" the skeleton is now housed in a museum in @entity11 , but will be moved to a new dinosaur museum in the city that is currently being built			0
how much do you really know about dinosaurs ?			0

a 50 - foot long skeleton may reveal a new species of long - necked dinosaur
neck of the @entity55 spans half of its body length
*unearthed* in 2006 by local farmers , the bones are said to date back to the @entity6
