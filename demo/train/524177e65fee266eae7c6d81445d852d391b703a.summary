a debate of more than five years could stretch even longer with wednesday 's call for a health study on the proposed @entity4 oil pipeline from @entity5			1
two @entity7 senators -- @entity8 of @entity9 and @entity10 of @entity11 -- urged secretary of state @entity12 to examine higher rates of cancer and other illness reported in places impacted by the " tar sands " oil from northern @entity18			2
their letter to @entity12 sought to further delay the project that has support from @entity24 , some @entity7 , the oil industry and labor unions			2
a @entity28 poll in september showed 65 % of respondents favored building it			0
so why is this still being debated ? answers show how the pipeline has become a political albatross around the neck of president @entity36 and @entity7 as they try to hold onto control of the @entity38 in november 's congressional elections			1
what 's this all about ? a @entity5 company wants to complete a pipeline from northern @entity18 to the @entity44 that would carry the tar sands oil across six @entity47 states			2
the $ 5.3 - billion project by @entity49 needs federal approval because the pipeline crosses an international border			2
for now , the decision rests with the @entity54 headed by @entity12			2
@entity47 report on @entity4 indicates little climate impact environmental groups oppose the pipeline because extracting and refining the tar sands oil emits 17 % more of the carbon pollution that contributes to climate change than conventional oil production			1
detractors fear the project would increase @entity47 reliance on the dirtier oil at a time when the nation -- one of the world 's biggest carbon emitters -- should be moving away from fossil fuel dependence to limit climate change			1
" at the end of the day , @entity4 is not just another oil pipeline ; it 's a gateway to the unchecked development of one of the world 's dirtiest fossil fuels , " wrote @entity74 of @entity75 in a @entity77 opinion piece on february 20			2
supporters say the years of study since @entity49 first sought @entity47 permission in 2008 show the pipeline itself would n't significantly increase greenhouse gas emissions			2
they note the project will create more than 3,000 temporary @entity47 jobs , as well as a likely greater number of indirect jobs			0
once it is built , the pipeline would need less than 50 permanent @entity47 jobs to operate it			0
senate minority leader @entity95 , a @entity24 of @entity96 , called the pipeline " the single largest shovel - ready project in @entity47 " and an " important project that wo n't cost taxpayers a dime to build but will bring thousands of private - sector jobs to @entity47 who desperately need them			0
" where does the @entity4 oil come from ? the pipeline starts in western @entity5 where tar - like black oil called bitumen saturates the sand around the @entity111 and other areas			0
in the 1920s , scientists discovered how to mix what was called tar sand with hot water and caustic soda to separate the components so they could extract the bitumen			0
now , major international oil companies have invested tens of billions of dollars to construct huge extraction and refining complexes around @entity124 , just over 200 miles northeast of @entity125			0
where does the pipeline go ? the @entity4 would begin in @entity128 , @entity18 , and extend for 1,179 miles through @entity129 , @entity130 , @entity131 and @entity132 to connect with existing segments in @entity134 , @entity135 and @entity136			2
once completed , it would carry 830,000 barrels a day that could travel to @entity139 and @entity140 on the @entity44			0
who wants it ? the september 11 , 2001 , @entity144 terror attacks prompted a @entity47 push to reduce its dependence on @entity148 oil			0
interest rose in getting it from @entity5 , a neighboring ally , and rising prices made the high cost of tar sands oil production more feasible			0
time to get serious on energy : @entity156 or dirty ? oil companies invested billions in tar sands complexes to extract and refine the @entity5 bitumen , and now want to cash in with increased production to meet both the @entity47 and export demand			0
republicans who traditionally support the oil industry and big business want the pipeline to keep the profits flowing and bolster the economy , while labor unions that historically align with @entity7 also back the project because of the jobs it will create			2
in addition , four @entity7 senators facing tough re-election battles this year -- @entity174 in @entity175 , @entity176 in @entity177 , @entity178 in @entity179 and @entity180 of @entity181 -- back the pipeline			1
" this single project will inject billions of dollars into @entity175 and national economies and reduce our dependence on oil from hostile countries , " said @entity174 , whose state has major oil production facilities			0
who opposes it ? the environmental lobby , with backing from wealthy liberal donors , has mounted a growing campaign of protests and other opposition to the pipeline			2
@entity74 , a billionaire former hedge fund manager , says he will spend up to $ 100 million in the 2014 election cycle to promote the fight against the climate change			1
" @entity47 can not lead the fight on climate change abroad while allowing even more pollution to be produced in our own backyard , " he wrote			1
" to truly be a global leader on climate change , president @entity36 must first make the right choices here at home			1
he must deny the @entity4			0
" 5 reasons why climate change is back in the news @entity8 and @entity10 opened a new front wednesday with their call for the @entity54 to include a full health review in assessing the pipeline project			1
" elevated levels of carcinogens and mercury have been documented downstream from tar sands extraction sites , and communities in these areas show elevated levels of rare cancer rates , " they said in their letter to @entity12			0
" @entity227 sands oil is very difficult to clean up when a spill occurs , and a 2010 tar sands pipeline spill into the @entity231 still has not been resolved			0
" they also cited " significantly higher levels of dangerous air pollutants and carcinogens " downwind from tar sand refineries , with people living those areas " suffering higher rates of the types of cancers linked to these toxic chemicals , including leukemia and @entity242 's lymphoma			0
" where does @entity36 stand ? in both of his inaugural addresses and his most recent @entity248 speech , @entity36 cited climate change as an issue of administration focus			1
he has mandated improved auto and truck fuel efficiency standards and toughened pollution regulations for new power plants , but the @entity4 issue has become the most visible symbol of the climate change debate			1
in a speech last year on climate change , @entity36 said the pipeline must be basically carbon - neutral , meaning that approving it would have no more impact on climate change that not approving it			1
@entity36 , @entity265 differences over @entity4 on display at summit a recent @entity54 environmental report concluded that building the pipeline would have little impact on overall carbon emissions from tar sands oil			1
approval or denial of any single project was unlikely to affect how much oil gets extracted from the tar sands , explained assistant secretary of state @entity278			0
election - year politics also come into play			0
@entity36 would risk a voter backlash against @entity7 candidates in november if he rejects the pipeline , which could cost the party its vital control of the @entity38			1
the split over the issue between pillars of the @entity7 liberal base -- with the environmental lobby opposing the pipeline and organized labor supporting it -- further confuses the president 's approach			1
what happens next ? more delay , most likely			0
release of the @entity54 environmental report on january 31 launched a 90 - day period for public comment and consultation			0
@entity12 , who is known for his effort to combat climate change , will then determine if the pipeline project is in the national interest , thought the final call clearly rests with @entity36			1
on wednesday , the @entity54 inspector general cleared one potential hurdle from a final decision by concluding there was no conflict of interest involving a group with ties to @entity49 that took part in the environmental impact study			1
@entity24 rep. @entity24 of @entity9 , who chairs the @entity317 , said the inspector general 's conclusion ended questions about the process , adding : " let 's stop the excuses and get @entity47 back to work			1
" however , the call for a health review by @entity8 and @entity10 offers potential cover for putting off a decision			1
so does a @entity132 state court ruling last week threw out the governor 's approval of the pipeline route through the state			1
with an appeal likely to take months , the court process gives the @entity36 administration a plausible reason for waiting until after the november vote			2
it would n't be the first that the process got delayed until after an upcoming election			0
in 2011 , the @entity36 administration postponed a decision on the pipeline due to concerns raised by @entity132 officials and environmental groups about the original route near the @entity349 , a major source of drinking water that is important for the state 's agricultural economy			1
republicans accused @entity36 of putting off the issue until after the 2012 presidential election , but their efforts to force an earlier decision failed to work			1
meanwhile , @entity49 rerouted the pipeline in the state .			0

inspector general finds no conflict of interest in environmental assessment
@entity132 court ruling , call for health review could put off pipeline decision
the issue involves tough politics for president @entity36 and @entity7
