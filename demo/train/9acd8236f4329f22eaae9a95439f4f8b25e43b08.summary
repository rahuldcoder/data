" with regard to media reports that @entity4 has been been suspended by the @entity1 , this is to clarify that mr. @entity4 has taken a voluntary leave of absence and is not under a suspension from the @entity1 , " the statement read			1
@entity4 , who finished 12th at the @entity43 last month , paired on the final day with eventual winner @entity44 , did not specify the exact length of his absence from golf in the statement released by his management company			1
" i am taking a leave of absence from professional golf , effective immediately			2
i will use this time to seek professional help for personal challenges i have faced , " it read			1

reacting to the announcement friday , @entity5 @entity16 captain @entity65 told the @entity60 website : " we will certainly miss @entity4 at @entity17 , and we wish him the best			1
" as one of the longest hitters in the game with an undefeated record of 3 - 0 at @entity73 in 2012 , he has clearly been an asset for the @entity5 team			2
that said , the @entity5 is a team with an abundance of talent			0
" @entity80 added to his captain 's words			0
" i 'll tell you what , with his power , you always want guys with that kind of power to play on any team			0
i 've been his partner in the @entity93 in @entity94 , and the fire power that he has , it 's pretty cool to be around , " said the 14 - time major winner			2
" it 's not too often you see a guy carry the ball 320 ( yards ) without even trying , and then when he steps on it he can hit it even further			2
when he gets it going , it 's awfully impressive			0
" @entity4 , who is currently ranked fifth in the standings of @entity5 golfers would have almost certainly been an automatic pick for the @entity16			1
the 30 - year - old has won eight titles on the @entity1 and is highly regarded by fans and fellow professionals for his big hitting game			1
former @entity115 champion and @entity117 @entity16 opponent @entity114 also passed on his regards to his friend and colleague			0
