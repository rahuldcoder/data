-- on behalf of all those @entity2 voters who have figured out that the @entity4 administration is the most hostile to @entity2 immigrants of any administration in the last half century and who are looking for an alternative , let me say this to the @entity12 presidential candidates : " bienvenidos to @entity14 ! now , behave yourselves			1
" like the saying goes , for everything there is a season			0
and as far as the @entity12 hopefuls are concerned , for every primary state , there is a makeover			1
after campaigning in three states with infinitesimally small latino populations -- the last of which , @entity24 , had red meat on the menu since it recently passed a tough anti-illegal immigration law -- the next state in the queue is @entity14 , where voters go to the polls on january 31 and where the @entity36 population is substantial			1
according to the @entity38 , the @entity36 population in @entity14 grew by an astonishing 57 % in the last 10 years			1
hispanics now account for 22.5 % of @entity40 , compared with 16.3 % of the entire @entity42 population			0
but that 's only half the story			0
@entity14 's @entity2 population was once made up almost entirely of conservative @entity46 in @entity14 , around @entity47 , who almost always vote @entity12			1
but in a dramatic change , it now also contains a large number of liberal @entity52 in central @entity14 , around @entity53 , who are more likely to vote @entity55			1
mix in large numbers of @entity57 , @entity58 and @entity59 and you have a spicy @entity62 stew that wo n't be easy to pander to with one message			0
the estimated 10 million @entity65 who are expected to cast ballots in november care about the same issues as other voters : jobs , the economy , health care , education			2
but with one major difference : immigration tends to float to the top of the list when tensions flare , as they did last year when @entity79 started a trend with a tough immigration law that all but requires the ethnic and racial profiling of @entity65			2
in addition , @entity83 - @entity42 , @entity52 and @entity58 - @entity42 all come to the immigration issue in different ways , and some are more fired up than others over the tendency of all politicians to exploit the issue for their benefit at the expense of @entity2 immigrants			2
for @entity12 , the good news is that president @entity4 has given them an opening			1
not only did @entity4 break his 2008 campaign promise to make immigration reform a priority in his first term , he also broke the record for deportations			2
his administration roped local police into the enforcement of immigration law through the @entity109 program , which requires police and sheriff departments to submit fingerprints to federal officials of anyone they arrest who they suspect is an illegal immigrant -- read @entity2			1
through this , the administration expelled more than 1.2 million illegal immigrants -- most of them @entity2 -- and , in the process , divided hundreds of thousands of families			1
but the bad news is that @entity12 -- in trying to pander to what their base wants , or rather what they think their base wants -- have made a mess of immigration to the point where many @entity65 tell me they would rather vote for @entity4 and " stick with the devil we know			1
" generally speaking , when asked about immigration , @entity12 come across as mean - spirited , ill - informed and narrow - minded			2
the presidential hopefuls have fallen into that trap			0
consider their dismal performance in monday 's debate in @entity137 , @entity14 , and how they addressed the question of what they would do about the @entity141 , a bill that would provide a pathway to citizenship for students who go to college or join the military			1
according to polls , the legislation enjoys the support of more than three - fourths of @entity65			2
even so , both @entity152 and @entity153 have said they would veto the bill because they , wrongly , consider it a form of " amnesty			0
" that would be something for nothing			0
the @entity141 offers something for something			2
but , at the debate , perhaps in an attempt to curry favor with @entity65 in @entity14 , @entity153 -- true to his reputation for flip - flopping -- tried to walk back from that declaration by saying he would sign a version of the @entity141 if it were only " focused on military service			1
" @entity171 said essentially the same thing , insisting that he , too , backed the military component of the legislation , but opposed the part that " simply says everybody who goes to college is automatically waived for having broken the law			0
" the only thing that is " simple " is @entity181 's understanding of what it means to break the law			0
when a parent brings his child into the country illegally , the parent breaks the law			0
but the child does n't			0
from that point forward , the child might be without legal status in the @entity42 , but that is not the same as someone making a conscious decision to violate a statute and open himself up to the consequences			0
when it comes to immigration , @entity12 offer little more than silliness , sound bites and simple solutions			1
do they really think that will help them with @entity65 in @entity14 , let alone help whichever of them emerges a victor appeal to voters in the general election ? if so , here 's a @entity212 phrase they should become familiar with : " @entity214			1
join the conversation on @entity219			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are soley those of @entity222			0

@entity222 : @entity14 's @entity2 population is booming , and more *diverse* than ever
@entity222 : @entity4 administration has given @entity12 an opening to gain @entity36 vote
@entity12 ' *rejection* of @entity141 , pandering to " base " *alienates* @entity65 , he writes
he says @entity12 need to offer more than silliness , sound bites , simple solutions
