@entity0 -- among the 90,000 secret @entity3 military documents posted on the internet this week by @entity5 are more than a dozen reports of possible attacks on @entity9 coalition aircraft using heat - seeking shoulder - fired missiles			1
it was that type of missile that brought down numerous @entity14 military aircraft when the @entity14 tried to occupy @entity9 in the 1980s			2
but among all the reports , one day stands out : may 30 , 2007			1
in the first of three attacks on that day , an @entity3 ch - 47 helicopter code named " @entity17 " was , according to a leaked report , " engaged and struck with a missile			1
" " the missile struck the aircraft in the left engine , " the report says			0
" the impact of the missile projected the aft end of the aircraft up as it burst into flames , followed immediately by a nose dive into the crash site			0
" all seven troops on board died , including five @entity3 , a @entity35 and a @entity36			2
the report goes onto say , " based on description of launch , size of round , and impact force of the projectile , it is assessed to be bigger than an @entity38 ( rocket - propelled grenade ) and possibly a surface - to - air missile			2
witness statements ... suggest @entity17 was struck by @entity49 ( man - portable air - defense system )			1
" manpads are shoulder - fired missiles that can home in on the heat from an aircraft 's engine to destroy it			1
a @entity3 military official in @entity9 said the reports do n't tell the whole story			1
" we 're aware of the report on surface - to - air missiles			1
what 's being presented is a pretty broad and somewhat random selection of documents that includes information that in some cases is incomplete or not verified by other sources or studies , " the official said			0
" there 's been no recent activity suggesting that these weapons are a threat , as attested by the volume of our daily air activity and the causes of aircraft incidents , which we report			0
" within half an hour of the first attack , two @entity82 helicopter gunships were fired on by what the pilots thought was a missile			0
the helicopters were not damaged			0
another half hour later , another attack came from the ground on the same @entity90			0
the report on that incident reads , " this was possibly the second @entity49 engagement against this flight of @entity90 in a 30 - minute period			1
clearly , the @entity97 were attempting to down an @entity82 after downing the @entity98			0
" many more reported @entity49 attacks or possible @entity49 attacks were reported in 2007 , but none brought down a coalition aircraft			1
perhaps the best known and most effective manpads are @entity3 - made @entity104 , which the @entity3 supplied to @entity9 militia to fight the @entity14			1
at least two of the reports indicate that a @entity110 missile could have been used to attack coalition aircraft , albeit unsuccessfully			1
one report details that case of a missile fired at an @entity3 @entity115 by what was believed to be a manpad			2
and because the missile blew itself up as it approached anti-missile flares , the report 's author suggested it was a @entity110			2
" a @entity123 would have likely been the only @entity49 ( currently known to be in @entity9 ) capable of a proximity detonation onto the dispensed flares , " the unidentified commander wrote			2
the hornet was not damaged and no one was hurt			0
most of the reports mentioning the specific type of manpads refer to older , less sophisticated missiles of @entity134 or @entity14 design			1
" the 1st or 2nd generation @entity49 generally encountered in @entity9 ( @entity138 , @entity139 , @entity140 , sa - 16 ) would have had to have made direct contact with one of the flares ( in order to ) initiate the detonator , " the report on the @entity115 attack says			2
there 's no doubt @entity49 are in @entity9			0
one coalition raid on a weapons cache in 2005 found four manpads in storage			0
and during a meeting between @entity3 military leaders and a provincial governor , " the governor reported that a man claiming to have manpads for sale has been in touch with his staff , presumably to give @entity160 ( coalition forces ) an opportunity to buy them and get them out of circulation , " one of the leaked reports says			1
" the governor referred to them as @entity171 missiles			0
the seller is going to show the governor a picture to prove that he has them			0
" it is unclear from the report whether the coalition ever secured the missiles the governor talked about .			0

documents posted on @entity5 include possible attacks by @entity49
the missiles may have been used in three attacks on may 30 , 2007
the heat - seeking " man - portable air - defense " units include @entity3 @entity110 missiles
most reports refer to older , less sophisticated @entity134 or @entity14 designs
