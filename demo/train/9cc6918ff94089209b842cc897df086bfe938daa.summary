-- barely 120 years old , @entity1 is suffering from growing pains as it goes through an awkward adolescence			1
@entity1 is a city built on gold			1
it 's a city still trying to recover from the injustices of apartheid and if progress can sometimes seem slow , it 's worth remembering that it 's only been 15 years since apartheid was finally laid to rest			1
@entity12 will take time , but @entity1 is a pragmatic city			1
its endless urban sprawl wo n't win any beauty contests but this place has always been more about economics than aesthetics			2
that 's because @entity21 ' burg is a city built on gold			2
the metropolis was nothing but grassy farmland until prospectors struck gold a few kilometers away in 1886			1
its once - abundant gold reserves helped @entity21 ' burg grow into the largest city in @entity33 and become the capital of the province of @entity36 -- a @entity38 word meaning " place of gold			2
" watch @entity41 take @entity0 on a tour of @entity1 Â» while modern day @entity21 ' burgers prefer to look to the future , it will be a long time before the city shakes off the memories of its troubled past			2
places like @entity50 -- the township that was the site of the 1976 uprisings that marked @entity53 of white rule -- will always be associated with apartheid			0
conditions in @entity50 are still tough and townships like @entity58 remain desperately poor			0
it 's true that @entity21 ' burg has a growing black middle class , but it also has a growing divide between its haves and have - nots			0
after @entity33 's first democratic elections in 1994 @entity1 experienced a new , unofficial apartheid as businesses moved away from downtown to the city 's wealthier , whiter , northern suburbs , leaving the city center a shadow of its once dynamic self			1
numerous urban development projects , many intended to ready the city for the @entity76 , are reinvigorating the heart of @entity21 ' burg			1
the city is getting an extensive new bus system , and the much - touted @entity81 is a high - speed train line that will link @entity21 ' burg and @entity84			0
the @entity86 area is growing as a cultural center , with art galleries , theaters and dance venues , and @entity91 , once the site of a prison that held @entity94 and later @entity95 , has been converted into the country 's highest law court and a tourist attraction , with exhibitions dedicated to its unsavory past			0
the most cosmopolitan city in @entity33 , @entity21 ' burg has always been thoroughly multicultural , but a wave of xenophobic attacks in may 2008 highlighted the tension between locals and the huge number of @entity109 immigrants who have moved to the city , attracted by its relative economic vigor			0
the violence did nothing to help the city 's international reputation			0
where @entity21 ' burg was once associated with apartheid , it has now become associated with crime			0
lurid tales of carjacking and daylight mugging have created an image of a lawless sin city , but although places like @entity127 remain no - go areas at night , progress is being made in the war on crime			0
nonetheless , the fear of crime remains potent and @entity21 ' burg 's future as a tourist destination depends on addressing the problem			0
if @entity21 ' burg is a work in progress there 's no doubt that much remains to be done , but it 's a young city with a young population eager to take the opportunities past generations were denied			1
the eyes of the world will be on @entity33 in summer 2010 and @entity21 ' burgers are keen to use the @entity147 to demonstrate how far their city has come and to show the world that the future is bright for the city of gold at the heart of the rainbow nation .			1

@entity1 is a young city , still recovering from the injustices of apartheid
the city was just grassy farmland until prospectors struck gold in 1886
many urban development projects are reinvigorating the heart of @entity1
the 2010 @entity147 is a chance to show how far @entity1 has come
