dear @entity0 , you sure are n't perfect			1
numerous city aldermen and officials have been brought down by corruption charges			1
you have a high rate of gun violence , which has cast shadows upon your reputation			2
despite the long list of wrongs , there are a lot of things you do right			2
@entity16 and loving visitors are consistently complimentary of you			2
we say this without shame : @entity0 , we love you , imperfections and all			1
you are 77 official neighborhoods , according to the mayor 's office			2
but more than 200 " pocket " neighborhoods make up your anatomy			2
@entity27 : who creates @entity0 's neighborhoods ? your people ride through your bloodstream on the l , where we can see your distinct personalities in each lively neighborhood			1
concert venues and @entity38 's favorite hangout , the @entity39 , beam as we zoom through @entity41			2
the @entity42 emanates natural beauty on the @entity44			2
and lessons from the past fill our minds as we near the @entity47 in @entity48			2
" @entity0 is the world in one place			1
it 's being able to get tacos in @entity51 one day for lunch and tzatziki in @entity54 the next , " says 21 - year - old student @entity55			1
@entity57 , @entity58 or @entity59 , you 've got the world covered			1
your citizens make you who you are , with people from across the globe calling you home			0
some stay put in their ethnic enclaves , speaking their native tongues , while others are curious neighborhood hoppers who seek authentic food and culture			0
just saying your name is enough to conjure fond memories for @entity72			0
she can imagine riding down @entity74 on a warm summer evening			0
summer is when our love for you crescendos			1
you are at your peak of liveliness			0
tight - knit families watching movies in the park , children playing games at @entity86 and couples strolling along the magnificent lakefront are some of the things that bring you to life come summer			0
" @entity0 's parks are the settings for ( a ) world - class collection of sculptures , and the people of @entity0 are lucky enough to have them in their backyard , " says @entity91			1
but even in the winter , for any of us who brave the never - ending snowfall and brutal , subzero wind chills , you are truly a beauty			0
when the tourists are too scared to come outside , it 's us locals who get the rare treat of staring into @entity107 ( affectionately known as " the @entity107 " ) all alone			0
@entity108 witnessed your quiet side during a moment just like this			0
while the @entity107 , @entity116 and @entity118 's @entity117 are all figures of beauty , your buildings and stunning skyscrapers are architectural marvels in themselves			0
whether we 're lost in the past of the historic @entity123 building or meandering through the urban canyons beneath the futuresque @entity125 , your architecture tells us the story of your life			0
sometimes , you talk to us through your buildings			0
when the @entity129 made the playoffs last year , skyscrapers lit up with words of encouragement			0
the same treatment goes for the @entity134 , @entity135 , @entity136 and well , someday the @entity137			0
( here 's to hoping someone breaks the @entity140 soon ! ) share your @entity142 photos your cheering buildings prove you 're a big city that does n't take yourself too seriously			1
as @entity151 puts it , " @entity145 have a unique blend of small - town @entity148 charm and a gritty city work ethic			0
" and if your gleaming towers and your potholed streets are your skeleton , then your heart lies in your people			1
@entity157 , who moved away as a child , said it well : " @entity0 does n't just reside in our heart -- it is our heart			1
@entity0 is us , we of @entity0 are @entity0			1
" @entity0 , no matter what anyone says , we will always be proud to call you home			1
