@entity0 -- taxes , religion and education -- this politically charged trifecta divided the @entity6 on wednesday in a case involving a state school choice program			2
at issue is a lawsuit challenging @entity12 's tax breaks for voluntary donations benefiting private school scholarships			1
the 13 - year - old program provides dollar - for - dollar income tax breaks for money given to " school tuition organizations , " or @entity19			1
some @entity12 taxpayers challenged the program as unconstitutional because , they say , not - for - profit religious organizations award most of the scholarships , and require children to enroll in religious schools			1
those opponents say the state has effectively been funneling taxpayer money to religious schools through a third - party " front " group			1
the justices appeared torn over whether that represented a de facto " endorsement " of religion by @entity12			1
" the state could not give tuition vouchers on the basis of religion -- could not say , if you are a @entity44 you do n't get these tuition vouchers , " said justice @entity37 , who was impressive in her command of the complex issues argued			2
" but what the state has done here , apparently , is to set up a scheme that uses intermediaries that can make exactly that distinction , that can say -- sorry , if you are a @entity44 you do n't get scholarships out of our @entity51			2
" one key issue for the court is whether the tax credit means the donated amount is the government 's money or an individual 's			1
" there is a very important philosophical point here			0
you think that all the money belongs to the government , except to the extent that it deigns to allow private people to keep some of it , " justice @entity63 told a lawyer for the taxpayer plaintiffs			1
" they do n't owe it to the government if they have made this contribution			2
that 's the whole point			0
" besides the church - state questions , the high court must decide whether individual residents have " standing " to sue the state , even if they do not donate to the scholarship program			2
that could be the key legal point the justices decide to tackle , aside from the larger state - action debate			0
the growing popularity of school choice plans around the country has raised fresh legal questions about whether @entity12 's plan is religion - neutral , and whether parents have true decision - making power , free from government intervention			1
a federal appeals court ruled the decade - old lawsuit could proceed			2
in 2002 , the @entity6 separately upheld school voucher programs			0
supporters of the @entity12 aid program say theirs is no different from the @entity99 program approved eight years ago , because in both cases , government does not direct any money to religious schools			1
@entity104 can receive a $ 500 credit ( $ 1,000 for a couple filing jointly ) off their state income taxes for contributions to school tuition organizations , which operate as charities			0
these organizations must spend at least 90 percent of money received on scholarships , and must offer them to students at more than one school			1
parents would apply for the tax - credit funded scholarships at either a religious or secular school			1
state figures show more than 50 school tuition organizations had received about $ 400 million in contributions through last year			0
in 2009 the program provided 27,000 scholarships to 373 schools , with most going to students who would not have been able to afford to attend			1
an @entity129 newspaper investigation found that of the $ 54 million in scholarships awarded in 2008 , 93 percent went to students attending religious schools			1
four @entity12 taxpayers had sued the state and some of the largest school tuition organizations			1
the plaintiffs are represented by various outside groups including the @entity139			0
in oral arguments , the divided bench struggled over whether these four @entity12 taxpayers could claim they were directly affected by how the scholarship money was spent , and whether the program was funded by money from the government or private contributors			1
arguing for the @entity149 administration , acting solicitor general @entity147 defended the state program , saying parents ultimately control where the scholarship money is spent			0
" if you placed an electronic tag to track and monitor each cent that the [ suing taxpayers ] pay in tax , not a cent , not a fraction of a cent , would go into any religious school 's coffers , " he said			1
several left - leaning justices appeared unconvinced			0
echoing the arguments of the taxpayer plaintiffs , justice @entity165 said , " either you pay it to the state [ in taxes ] or you use it for this [ school ] purpose , but it 's the state 's money and it 's given you by its largesse , the right to redirect it			1
" " does anyone have standing , in your view , to challenge this scheme ? " justice @entity181 asked the government lawyer			1
" the @entity183 will be unenforceable unless we recognize taxpayer standing			0
" " suppose that an @entity51 -- this is a hypothetical case -- discriminated on the basis of race			0
no @entity193 or no white or no black can receive our money , " said justice @entity189 , who could well prove the deciding vote in this appeal			1
" do n't you think a strong argument can be made that it can be attributed to the state , " allowing a private individual discrimination claim to be made			0
" the state has all sorts of rules about what an @entity51 has to be			0
the state provides the mechanism through the credit for the funding			0
" @entity37 added , " there are @entity206 that make these distinctions that clearly would be impermissible if the state administered the program			0
" @entity209 , attorney for the plaintiffs by contrast , faced tough questioning from several conservative justices over the state action			0
" how is it discriminating on the basis of religion if the @entity51 does n't care whether it goes to a religious school or not ? it 's treated the same ? " asked chief justice @entity219			1
" that does n't matter			0
if the state 's grantee cares , that 's unconstitutional , " said @entity209 , an @entity222 professor			0
" this is a government spending program			0
is there any doubt about that ? the money in this program is not private charitable contributions			2
" " it 's a great leap to say that it 's government funds , that any money the government does n't take from me because it gives me a deduction , is government money , " said justice @entity233			1
" this money has never been in the government 's coffers			2
the government has declined to take this money			2
" taxpayers are generally limited in their ability to claim constitutional wrongdoing over government spending			2
a special class was carved by the high court 42 years ago for some kinds of disputes related to the @entity255 's prohibition on government " establishment of religion			2
" the current cases are @entity260			0
v. @entity261 ( 09 - 987 ) and @entity262 v. @entity261 ( 09 - 991 )			0
a ruling is expected sometime next year .			0

@entity12 gives tax credits for money donated for private school scholarships
four taxpayers filed suit , saying this amounts to government aid to religious schools
justice @entity189 could be the deciding vote on a split court
