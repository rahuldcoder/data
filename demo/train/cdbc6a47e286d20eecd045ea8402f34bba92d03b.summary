@entity0 -- @entity3 president @entity2 slammed sunday an @entity5 film and the violent and deadly protests it triggered in the @entity8 world			1
@entity2 spoke to @entity1 's @entity9 in @entity0 , ahead of the president 's visit to the @entity12 this week			1
" fundamentally , first of all , any action that is provocative , offends the religious thoughts and feelings of any people , we condemn , " he said about the inflammatory film that mocks the @entity14 as a womanizer , child molester and killer			2
@entity24 minister offers reward for anti-islam filmmaker 's death " likewise , we condemn any type of extremism			1
of course , what took place was ugly			2
offending the @entity32 is quite ugly			2
this has very little or nothing to do with freedom and freedom of speech			2
this is the weakness of and the abuse of freedom , and in many places it is a crime			2
it should n't take place and i do hope the day will come in which politicians will not seek to offend those whom others hold holy , " said @entity2			1
" we also believe that this must also be resolved in a humane atmosphere , in a participatory environment and we do not like anyone losing their lives or being killed for any reason , anywhere in the world			1
" the privately produced film sparked protests against the @entity60 , where it was made			0
while most of the demonstrations have been peaceful , some were marred by violence that has left more than two dozen people dead -- among them @entity60 ambassador to @entity68 @entity67 and three other @entity60 killed in an attack on the consulate in @entity71 , @entity68 , that reportedly followed a demonstration against the film			0
when asked by @entity9 whether he thought protesters should stop threatening @entity60 staff abroad , @entity2 responded that he can not say what other people or nations should do , but that he believes " extremism gives birth to following and subsequent extremists			1
" perhaps if the politicians take a better position in the @entity86 vis - a - vis offensive words or thoughts or pictures towards what we hold holy , i think conditions will improve , " the president said			1
@entity94 leader urges @entity95 to exercise ' patience and wisdom ' during the wide - ranging interview , which will be broadcast monday , @entity2 discussed what @entity3 would do if @entity100 were to attack it			1
" any nation has the right and will indeed defend herself			0
but my question is this : why should the world be managed in such a way that an individual can allow himself to threaten a rich and deeply rooted historical , ancient country , such as @entity3			0
a great country , such as @entity3 , based on an excuse of his own fabrication ... another country can say , i am guessing that country @entity116 is doing activity @entity118 , therefore i will attack that country ... can this be ... a successful formula for the management of the world ? " @entity2 asked			1
the president was likely referring to his country 's disputed nuclear program			1
some world powers , particularly @entity127 nations , suspect that @entity3 is seeking to build nuclear weapons			0
@entity129 insists its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes			0
in response to whether he feared a war , or military conflict , with @entity100 was imminent , @entity2 said : " the @entity135 are very much , very adventuresome , very much seeking to fabricate things and i think they see themselves at the end of the line and i do firmly believe that they seek to create new opportunities for themselves and their adventurous behaviors			1
" in related news sunday , a top general in @entity3 said his country would be capable of defeating @entity100 within a day , according to @entity3 's state - run @entity146			1
@entity147 urges @entity60 to set ' red line ' for @entity3 " a regime ( with a frontier ) that in some spots is only 24 kilometers wide could have its back broken by one of our infantry battalions in 24 hours , " brigadier general @entity149 reportedly said			0
" our strategic doctrines are all defensive , but our tactics are invasive			0
it means that we do not initiate any war , but if anyone wages a war against us , we will counterattack incessantly and will not stop , " he said , @entity146 reported			0
" the enemy could initiate a war , but its ending would be up to us			0
" president @entity2 also spoke strongly about his views on homosexuality			1
let me ask you this			0
do you believe that anyone is giving birth through homosexuality ? homosexuality ceases procreation			2
who has said that if you like or believe in doing something ugly , and others do not accept your behavior , that they 're denying your freedom ? " he asked @entity9			1
" proper education must be given ... the education system must be revamped			2
the political system must be revamped			0
and these must be also reformed , revamped along the way			0
but if you , if a group recognizes an ugly behavior or ugly deed as legitimate , you must not expect other countries or other groups to give it the same recognition			0
" daughter of former @entity3 leader starts prison sentence			0
