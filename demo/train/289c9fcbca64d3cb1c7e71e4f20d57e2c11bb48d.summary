@entity0 , @entity1 -- if your company bans you from using @entity6 , @entity7 , @entity8 and other social media in the office , that policy is " brain dead " , entrepreneur @entity12 told me			1
@entity12 , listed as one of the 40 most influential minds in tech , is right of course			2
and here are five reasons , borrowing from several books published this year			2
it 's self - defeating			2
dictatorial office managers be warned			2
banning social media at work is about as viable as @entity26 's attempts to halt the tide			1
as @entity28 argues in " @entity29 of @entity30 : @entity35 the internet makes @entity36 " , social media is actually contributing to the demise of the large organization			1
besides , since most workers now have their own smart phones and tablets , it 's actually impossible -- without establishing an all - seeing totalitarian regime at the office -- to stop workers peeking a look at the their @entity7 updates or @entity6 feeds while in the restroom			1
it 's such an old idea			2
even the word " banning " is archaic			2
as @entity49 argues in " @entity50 " , by undermining traditional hierarchies and gatekeepers , the @entity34 makes it more and more difficult to outlaw anything			1
" being in charge is n't what it used to be , " he notes in the book 's subtitle			1
@entity61 dictators should , of course , beware			2
but so should formerly all - powerful office it directors or hr managers whose monopoly of authority and power has been undermined by the worldwide web			0
like @entity70 , the 21st century office has been radically democratized			0
tightly controlled , top - down offices do n't work anymore			1
they are so 20th century			0
social media is the new coffee break			1
it 's the 21st century version of the water cooler			0
it 's how we get our news , keep up with friends and colleagues , make our social arrangements , establish our identities and view the world			1
our obsessive use of social media means that we are all living in the perpetual present , says @entity2 columnist @entity88 in " @entity89 : when everything happens now "			1
it 's what social media gurus @entity92 and @entity94 describe , in " @entity96 "			1
as @entity92 notes , this social media rich environment , in which everything we do becomes " social data " , is what he calls the " new world "			1
this is both " scary " and " freaky " , as @entity92 acknowledges			0
but it 's an inevitable as self - driving cars or wearable computers			0
to ban social media , therefore , is to essentially ban people at work			1
it 's like outlawing talking or laughing			0
you might as well ban breathing			0
as anyone with children knows , multitasking is how digital natives live their hyper - connected lives			0
and the same is increasingly true at work			1
@entity123 , we sat in an office all day then went home to enjoy our leisure			0
but today , work and leisure are inextricably connected			1
so that occasional tweet or @entity7 update from the office does n't mean you are n't working			2
it just means that some of your brain might be temporarily focused on something else			0
but that temporary focus describes the nature of 21st century work			2
it 's how we all -- even the most efficient among us -- operate in the networked age			0
as @entity142 notes in her best - seller " reality is broken : @entity146 " , multitasking actually makes us more creative by stimulating our playfulness			0
it makes us more productive because it opens up our minds			0
social media not only enables us to group - solve big problems , but also makes us more literate , able to think with more independence and gives us an @entity154 - like sense of what other people are thinking , according to @entity157 in " smarter than you think : how technology is changing our minds for the @entity161 "			1
through @entity6 , we get access to newspaper articles and stories that we would otherwise have missed			0
@entity8 enables us to network with fellow workers			0
@entity7 gives us intelligence about competitive ideas and companies			0
and banning social media at work only empowers that intelligence even more by encouraging us to network with more open - minded and innovative companies			1
the @entity175 conference brought together entrepreneurs , venture capitalists , writers and technologists to imagine the future of 21st century digital society			0
it was organized and produced by @entity183 and was hosted by @entity184 and @entity185 at @entity184 's @entity186 .			1

*bosses* should be *relaxed* about *employees* going on social media at work , says @entity183
it increases creativity and benefits the company or organization , he argues
and anyway , you wo n't be able to stop it , @entity183 warns *employers*
