-- the stunning assassinations of several key @entity3 leaders and the outbreak of serious combat in @entity6 last week momentarily held out the possibility that president @entity9 's regime will rapidly fall			1
many hoped for a cascade of defections , a rise in popular demonstrations and a rebel surge to bring down the government			0
those hopes were exaggerated , fueled by a feverish rumor mill , psychological warfare and notoriously unreliable information coming out of @entity3			2
while the regime has been shaken , its military capability stands as demonstrated by its bloody reassertion of control over @entity6			0
along with the support of @entity30 , its determination to survive at any price could draw out the endgame			1
the assassinations struck at the heart of the security machine that sustains the regime , and they highlight the extent to which political and military tide has long since turned against @entity9			1
the assassinations were more of an inflection than a turning point			0
diplomatically isolated , financially strapped and increasingly constrained by a wide range of international sanctions , @entity9 's regime has been left with little room to maneuver			1
it resorts to indiscriminate military force and uses shabiha gangs and propaganda to inflict terror			0
the government 's violence against peaceful protestors and innocent civilians has been manifestly self - defeating			0
@entity54 has failed to kill his way to victory			0
day by day , through accumulating mistakes , the regime is losing legitimacy and control of @entity3 and its people			1
nonetheless , it 's premature to think the end is close			0
the opposition 's progress , reportedly with increasing external funding and training , has put greater pressure on @entity9 's forces			1
but the opposition 's military success has exacerbated the fears of retribution attacks and a reign of chaos should the regime crumble			2
the much - maligned political efforts of @entity79 special envoy @entity78 , backed by the @entity80 , were meant to find a political solution that could prevent precisely such a deterioration of the situation on the ground			2
now , even if @entity9 's regime collapses , violence may prove difficult to contain given that the country is deeply polarized and awash in weapons			1
@entity54 's end could pave the way for an even more intense civil war			0
making matters worse , the continuing fragmentation among the @entity3 opposition groups raises deep fears about their ability to unite themselves or to establish authority			2
few foundations exist for an inclusive and stable political order after @entity9			2
the @entity102 administration was prudent and wise to avoid a direct military intervention in @entity3			1
a legion of pundits deemed an @entity80 military role necessary for any progress against @entity9			1
clearly , it was not			0
indeed , a limited intervention would likely have strengthened @entity9 's hand at home and abroad			1
had the @entity80 chosen to carry out airstrikes to enforce a no - fly zone or safe havens , @entity3 's crisis would likely be no closer to resolution but @entity80 would be deeply embroiled			1
some have suggested that the @entity80 should provide weapons to favored factions among the opposition groups			2
this , too , is a dangerous idea			0
there is no reason to believe that these factions would reward the @entity80 with loyalty			2
what the @entity80 should do is focus its efforts on maintaining international pressure and sanctions on @entity9 while preparing for a transition			1
it should disseminate credible information about the regime 's atrocities			1
it should aggressively plan to bring the architects of @entity3 's well - documented massacres to face international justice			2
( it is far too late for an amnesty for @entity9 and his top aides , but lower - level officials should be offered a deadline to defect to avoid prosecution			0
) when @entity9 falls , the @entity3 opposition will urgently need to unite @entity3 and short - circuit the emergence of an insurgency from supporters of the old regime			1
preventing reprisal killings , including all groups in the political process , and incorporating public servants who are not implicated in war crimes will be essential			0
the @entity80 should help prepare the @entity3 opposition for the challenges of governing a fractured country by facilitating the negotiation for a representative and unified political entity , with a greater role for pragmatic leaders on the inside			1
it could send a small @entity79 stabilization force to @entity3 to as a monitor			0
and it will have to persuade the armed insurgency to police its own ranks to avoid sectarian fights			0
the hopes of a soft landing in @entity3 have been destroyed by the regime 's violence			1
the @entity80 must now try to deal as best it can with the grinding struggle to come			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity177 .			0

last week , key @entity3 security leaders were assassinated by @entity3 insurgency
@entity177 : *briefly* , many thought that @entity9 's regime would rapidly fall
he says the regime 's determination to survive at any price could draw things out
