-- " i just love it when i get milk - to - dark converts , " says @entity3 , as she prepares to lead a small cocoa - hungry crowd through the narrow streets of @entity8 's @entity7			1
@entity3 , who makes a living leading people to the city 's finest chocolates , need n't worry too much -- we 're already lost to the dark side			1
we 've joined her on a sunny afternoon in @entity15 , outside the flagship shop of @entity17 , a high - quality chocolate maker known for its delicate @entity21 bite - sized almond meringues			2
we 're here because , although in @entity8 you 're never more than a praline 's throw from an artisanal chocolatier ( not that any sane person would throw away a perfectly good praline ) , it 's surprisingly tricky to locate truly excellent chocolate			1
it 's a task for a local connoisseur who 's already cracked the cocoa code			1
@entity3 is a @entity34 with bright eyes , an unbelievably slim figure and a constant smile fueled by chocolate			1
she 's also the founder of the @entity8 tour			1
a resident of @entity8 for the past six years , @entity39 shares her knowledge and passion about the small shops during tours she 's been running since 2011			1
outside @entity17 , @entity3 steers us away from what we thought would be our first chocolate hit			1
" you should definitely visit @entity17 while you are here , " she says			0
" the place is always lively , but it 's not included in our tour as we will focus on the more hidden , artisanal shops that would be harder to discover on your own			2
a few minutes later , we 're on a lively pedestrian street in the @entity7 , sampling the wares in @entity57 , a family - owned confectionery and chocolate shop founded in 1905			1
unexpected ingredients i 'm instantly hooked on @entity62 -- one of @entity3 's suggestions -- a crumbly nougat feuilletine with tonka bean and a pinch of @entity68 , covered with @entity70 65 % and milk chocolate			1
naturally , it 's easier , and much more fun , to taste than to describe			0
during our next stops , we taste a variety of chocolate creations , often mixed with unexpected ingredients , such as lemongrass or galangal , that test our taste buds and preconceptions			0
" the secret lies in the balance : if you find the correct one , then the combination simply works , " @entity3 says			2
cupcakes are included in today 's menu and we happily try the moist , light cakes with cream cheese toppings ( a refreshing alternative to usual butter cream ) and playful names such as @entity92 and @entity93			0
between choc stops , we pause at some of the city 's numerous fountains to cleanse our palates			0
with church bells in the background , we discuss all things chocolate , such as cocoa bean origins and cocoa percentages			2
we learn that , as with wines , it 's important to know where the beans originate from , because their " terroir " significantly determines chocolate flavor			1
it transpires the cocoa percentage figure given on many chocolate bars merely indicates darkness and sugar content and is no reflection of quality			2
as well as feeding our chocolate - buzzed minds with facts about the world of cocoa , @entity3 also tells us how she began leading tours of @entity8 's sweet spots			1
becoming a chocolate tour guide " when friends and family would come to visit , i would take them to my favorite sweet shops , " she says			2
" of course we would go to @entity17 , a @entity8 institution , but it was fun to go to the small local shops where the owners had become friends , where we would chat and taste lots , too			1
" while answering questions about @entity135 confectionery on her blog , she realized that many of her friends who were either from @entity8 or living there for years , did n't know about her favorite chocolate shops			1
that 's when she decided to do something about it			0
our sugary tour concludes in @entity144 , a legendary coffee house that 's been successfully transformed into a pastry heaven			0
owned by gastronome @entity148 , it 's housed in an impressive 14th - century building with a lavish interior and photogenic ornamental cash register			1
the star here is the hot chocolate , which we taste in its cold edition , but there 's an abundance of homemade pastries , cakes , ice creams and savory items			0
while we 're recounting our favorite tastings from the evening , the manager invites us to taste his latest discovery , a surprisingly refreshing cold brew of coffee mixed with tonic water			0
another great taste from the dark side			0
tasting instructions we ask @entity3 to share her expertise on the art of proper chocolate tasting			2
" use all your senses to recognize and appreciate a good quality chocolate bar ; look for a nice sheen , not too glossy nor dull , " she says			0
" sound : break off a piece and you should hear a distinct snap , letting you know it was well - tempered			0
" smell : there are countless aromas in cocoa beans , so you 'll smell a variety of natural aromas from fruits to spices to nuts , depending on the origin of the bean			1
" taste : let it melt in your mouth -- do n't chew -- and you should taste several flavors and no bitterness			2
" a sign of a good quality chocolate is when there are several stages of flavor -- they develop in your mouth as it melts			2
more importantly , the flavor does n't just disappear after you swallow , but lingers			0
" @entity207 ; tours run tuesday to friday at 2 p.m. and last about two and a half hours ( tour groups are typically two to eight people ) ; @entity212 ( $ 93 ) @entity213 is a freelance journalist with an interest in travel , food and lifestyle stories			0
she 's based in @entity218 , @entity135			0
@entity0 's series often carry sponsorship originating from the countries and regions we profile			0
however , @entity0 retains full editorial control over all of its reports			0

@entity8 tour focuses on local chocolate confectionery gems like @entity230 and @entity231 - @entity148
@entity3 advises chocolate tasters to let the chocolate melt -- not chew
as with wines , it 's important to know where cocoa beans originate , because their " terroir " determines flavor
