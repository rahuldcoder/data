" " you 've got to consult the people from time to time , the @entity9 people have n't been consulted since 1975 , the @entity31 have , the @entity30 have , the @entity29 have -- now is the moment			2
" @entity6 made headlines wednesday by promising the @entity9 people a vote on @entity10 membership if he wins the next general election in 2015			1
@entity6 told @entity2 's @entity38 that he has no regrets over the referendum promise , despite unhappiness among some @entity43 partners			2
" it 's really important that we 've set out a plan for how we get change in @entity43 that will benefit all of @entity43 , making it more open , more competitive , more flexible , and how we secure @entity9 's place within that , " he said			2
@entity51 : do you think @entity9 should stay in the @entity10 ? the @entity10 is already changing to meet the needs of the 17 members who are part of the euro single currency , @entity6 said			1
@entity9 is not in that group			0

" @entity31 foreign minister @entity69 used similar language in an interview on @entity72 saying @entity43 could not be " a la carte , " @entity68 ( @entity68 ) reported			2
@entity6 : we must focus on trade , taxes , transparency @entity14 believes any vote would result in @entity9 remaining in the @entity10			1

" that is always going to be their objective and you have to forgive them for that , they are bound to use what bureaucratic tools they can to achieve those goals			0
they have n't succeeded i the past , i do n't believe they will succeed , " he added			0
" i think the key reason is actually in the end most sensible people in other @entity43 capitals know that it is in their interest , in the interest of the @entity10 , to have a massive global powerhouse in @entity4 rather than in @entity122 or @entity123			1
" and what did @entity4 's mayor think of the @entity16 in @entity0 ? " it 's all a bit intoxicating is n't it ? it is this great cyclotron of egos is n't it , everybody is bumping into each other and having an enormous ghastly , nauseating , mutual feelings of self - regard , " he said			1
