-- @entity1 : @entity2 walks through the door of the restaurant , just like the first time we met			1
her arms akimbo , reeling off her story			1
why she 's angry at someone i do n't know			1
what her son has to write for @entity14 class			1
why her other son 's social studies teacher does n't understand him			1
as large as her holiday dinners , her novel , her unfinished lists , her outrage at the world 's ills , her embrace , her laugh at her own expense			1
she 's invited me to lunch to celebrate my guggenheim fellowship , but 15 minutes in she has not stopped talking			1
finally , i must speak			1
" who would you be without your narrative ? " i wonder			1
possessed , she gets up without a word			1
walks out of the restaurant , comes back in , and starts over			1
this time she raises her coffee cup			1
" to you ! " she says			1
and turns it over -- the morning , the reason we 're here , the dialogue			1
we change direction and revise			2
why are we friends ? this is why			1
@entity0 : are you a good ( or bad ) friend ? @entity2 : i pretty much never fail to remind my friend @entity57 that we first met in our late 20s when i auditioned for a play of hers in which she made the fatal decision not to cast me			2
here is who i remember we were at the beginning			2
no doubts on her part that she was the real deal , an honest - to - @entity70 , daring , one - of - a - kind playwright			2
no doubts on mine that i was a born thespian with unique comedic gifts			2
no doubts that everything was indeed going to come up roses , because our parents told us so			2
i have no other friend who was so equally adored by her parents and no other friend who grasps so completely how shocked i still am that the world did not stop spinning to welcome me to it			2
@entity0 : @entity0 and @entity84 , uncensored @entity1 : do you know you never looked at my scar ? after my mastectomy , i asked you if you wanted to see it and you said you were n't ready			2
@entity2 : i had no memory of this moment and was instantly ashamed , even 24 years later , at the thought that my friend could have survived this loss and that i was too frightened to even acknowledge it			2
until i realized that what i knew all those years ago was that i could n't imagine my life without her in it , and looking at that scar would have brought me too close to the possibility that i might have lost her at our very beginning			2
@entity2 : what 's worse than not looking at your scar is the fight we had on the corner			1
@entity1 : well , not a fight			2
@entity2 : a large disagreeing			2
it felt like a fight			2
@entity2 : i wanted you to move on			2
stop being stuck in regret or sorrow			2
i did n't want you to waste time on what people did n't give you or how people were n't honoring you appropriately			0
@entity1 : that 's you ! you are talking about yourself			1
you ca n't tolerate my -- @entity2 : because i completely identify			0
@entity1 : i was going to say -- darkness			0
you ca n't tolerate my pain and worry over my son 's pain and worry			1
you do n't stop and let the other person 's world take space			1
you 're too wrapped up in your own circumstance			0
you who are totally uncontrollable in your panic at any disruption of your own family			0
that 's what the fight was about for me			1
@entity2 : i want us to live like we have two minutes left			0
but then you 'll have to stop talking			0
@entity0 : 5 friends every woman should have @entity2 : i do n't think i 've ever spent time with you without bursting out in great guffaws			1
@entity1 : that makes me want to cry			0
@entity2 : you have this burst laughter , this relish of laughter			0
i love hearing you laugh			0
i love making you laugh			0
i love laughing with you			0
i can count on you for laughter			0
@entity1 : we help each other get over ourselves			0
@entity2 : here are some boldfaced differences in who we are			0
she is a tiny thing and i can practically circle her wrist twice with my comparatively enormous hand			0
she is delicate inside and out , and i am a @entity163 peasant			0
i have two ( knock knock )			0
she was married to her high school sweetheart for ten years , had intense love affairs , and has been with @entity168 for ten			0
i have been married ( so far ) to the same husband for 26 years			0
she has never been fat			0
@entity1 : once , when i was 11			0
@entity0 : @entity170 meets the @entity171 @entity2 : can you remember the longest period that we have n't talked to each other ? @entity1 : a week ? @entity2 : if a week 's gone by , i start to think , " are we in one of those places where you need to tell me something ? " @entity1 : and i think , " what do n't you want to tell me ? " @entity0 : how to cope with the loss of a best friend @entity1 and @entity2 : sometimes it 's not wanting to be so intimately observed			1
because we 're onto each other			0
as many times as we vow there 's nothing that could rend us asunder , still the anxious space between when something bothers us and when we express it to each other is enormous and scary			1
we both have permission to be anything , to say anything			1
we know each other 's fragile places			1
and are tender with them			0
@entity2 : you 're one of the few friends , @entity57 , whom i walk arm in arm with			1
we do n't do it always , but sometimes			0
and i think the only other woman i 've done that with is my mom			0
@entity1 : so what 's the future of us ? @entity2 : that you finish three or maybe five more fabulous plays			1
that i get to be in each and every one of them			0
that we dance at our grandchildren 's weddings			1
that we wake up joyful and actually sleep through part of the night			0
and that we get to become the two older women we ca n't believe we 'll be			0
@entity1 : walking arm in arm to the movies in the middle of the afternoon			0
