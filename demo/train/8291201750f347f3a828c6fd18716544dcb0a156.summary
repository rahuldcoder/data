all tickets will be $ 45 , with @entity1 reserving the right to cancel a ticket in exchange for a refund if the ticketholder attempts to sell the ticket for " anything above the original price			1
" " making my shows affordable has always been my goal but two things have always worked against that			0
high ticket charges and ticket re-sellers marking up the prices , " explained @entity1 in the email			1
" some ticketing services charge more than 40 % over the ticket price and , ironically , the lower i 've made my ticket prices , the more scalpers have bought them up , so the more fans have paid for a lot of my tickets			2
" by selling the tickets exclusively on my site , i 've cut the ticket charges way down and absorbed them into the ticket price , " he continues			2
" to buy a ticket , you join nothing			0
just use your credit card and buy the damn thing			0
