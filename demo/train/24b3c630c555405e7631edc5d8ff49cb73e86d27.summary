@entity0 -- it 's now official			1
starting tuesday , members of @entity4 may receive generous health care benefits -- subsidized by @entity6			2
most lawmakers accept this insurance -- the same perk afforded to some 8 million federal employees and their families			1
but @entity12 are crying hypocrisy , saying republicans who want to repeal the health care law for @entity16 should not accept similar benefits for themselves			2
" it 's hypocritical when they all voted to undo the bill we did , to repeal the bill that we enacted -- that the president signed into law -- to provide for the first time for many @entity16 in 2014 access to what we as members of @entity4 have , " employer - provided health care , representative @entity19 , @entity21 - @entity20 , told @entity1 in an interview in his @entity24 office			1
some 16 @entity35 @entity14 are in fact opting out of health care benefits , including freshman representative @entity38 , @entity39			1
he told @entity1 his reason is " philosophical " -- saying that he campaigned against the health care law , and on a promise not to accept health care benefits			2
" i think that this piece of legislation that we passed is so critical and it will do such harm to our country , that i think we need a few of us to lead by example to point out some of its flaws , " @entity45 said			2
the @entity55 provides federal employees a wide range of private health care plans to choose from			1
though the benefit is subsidized by the government , the cost of the plans are relatively low because the pool of federal workers is so big			1
that 's the same theory behind the so - called exchanges being set up for most @entity16 as part of the new health care law			2
unlike most of @entity45 's congressional colleagues who are turning down government benefits , the @entity39 freshman did not have alternative health insurance , so he says he bought his own insurance coverage , which has a $ 5,000 deductible			2
@entity45 says his wife has a pre-existing condition , so insurance would not cover her			2
therefore , he says they will pay for the treatment for her ailment , which he declined to disclose , out of pocket			2
he says that cost is " sizeable			0
" " if i would of taken the congressional plan , i 'd taken the group policy , and my wife would have been covered and life would have been a heck of a lot easier			1
but this is the pledge that i made , it 's something my wife and i have thought long and hard about , and it 's a principle , and it 's important to both of us , " @entity45 said			0
representative @entity95 , another @entity14 freshman from @entity39 , is also declining coverage from the federal employees health benefit plan out of principle , saying he too ran on that promise			1
unlike @entity45 , @entity95 already has insurance that he will keep through his pizza parlor business back home			0
but in conversations with aides to nearly all the 16 known @entity14 not taking health insurance for lawmakers , most are doing so not because of philosophical opposition to government - subsidized health care , but instead because it is most practical for them			1
representative @entity111 , @entity112 , has @entity113 with the help of his state government , since he is a retired sheriff			0
others , like representative @entity117 , @entity118 , are veterans and already receive government benefits through the @entity120 department			0
and some , like representative @entity121 , @entity122 , and representative @entity123 , @entity124 , are not accepting the congressional health care benefit because they already have insurance through their own businesses back home			0
but that decision is costing people like @entity123 a lot more money			0
according to his chief of staff , @entity123 pays $ 1,200 a month for health insurance for his family , and would only be paying about $ 400 monthly if he accepted government benefits offered to him as a congressman			0
" they all have @entity140 , " noted democrat @entity138			0
" the 46 million @entity16 who do n't have insurance today do n't have a @entity142 " still -- regardless of their reasoning -- only a fraction of @entity14 who voted to repeal the health care law are forgoing government - subsidized insurance for themselves			1
@entity112 representative @entity149 , a @entity14 freshman elected with significant @entity151 support , is accepting the federal health care benefit			1
he dismisses @entity12 accusations that he and other lawmakers like him are hypocrites			0
@entity149 calls that @entity12 " propaganda			0
" @entity14 leadership aides insist there is nothing wrong with lawmakers , including @entity35 speaker @entity161 , accepting government - subsidized health care benefits , since the government is their employer			1
" the speaker , like president @entity166 , senator @entity167 and tens of millions of other @entity16 , gets his health coverage through his employer			0
that has nothing to do with opposition to @entity0 @entity12 ' unconstitutional , job - destroying health care law , " said @entity170 , spokesman for @entity35 speaker @entity161			0
they may be small in number , but some of @entity161 's freshmen @entity14 colleagues disagree			1
they say their opposition to the health care law is in fact connected to the government - subsidized insurance offered to them			0
representative @entity184 , @entity185 , is a freshman declining the federal benefits for philosophical reasons			1
according to spokeswoman @entity188 , @entity184 has a health savings account for his family , and has seen his premiums increase 30 % in the last year			0
@entity192 said if @entity184 were to opt in to federal health benefits , he would be able to cover his entire family for about $ 300 a month			1
under his current plan , he has to pay approximately $ 1,700 a month out of pocket			1
" he made a promise to his constituents that he would not take members ' health benefits because he wanted to live like everyone else in his district , " @entity192 said .			0
