@entity1 gov. @entity0 signed a wide - ranging gun bill into law wednesday that has critics howling and proponents applauding			1
@entity11 @entity6 , or the @entity7 of 2014 -- which opponents have nicknamed the " guns everywhere bill " -- specifies where @entity1 residents can carry weapons			1
included are provisions that allow residents who have concealed carry permits to take guns into some bars , churches , school zones , government buildings and certain parts of airports			1
@entity23 , which lobbied for the bill , calls it " meaningful pro-gun legislation , " despite it being watered down from the group 's perspective			1
still , the group has lauded the legislation , which will go into effect july 1			0
@entity33 opposed the bill , calling it " extremism in action			0
" wednesday 's signing came at an open - air picnic area along a creek in @entity40 , in northern @entity1			1
it opened with a prayer , the singing of the national anthem and a recital of the @entity46			0
hundreds of people filled more than 25 picnic tables , while others stood			0
many were openly carrying handguns , and some wore @entity53 hats and buttons proclaiming , " @entity55 " and " @entity50			1
" the bill , which easily navigated the state legislature -- by a 112 - 58 vote in the @entity11 and a 37 - 18 tally in the @entity60 -- also earned the support of @entity63 state sen. @entity62 , the grandson of ex-president @entity64 and a 2014 gubernatorial candidate			2
calling it " a great day to reaffirm our liberties , " @entity0 said the law allows residents to protect their families and expands the list of places where they can legally carry firearms , while allowing certain property owners , namely churches and bars , to make judgments on whether they want worshippers and patrons carrying guns			1
" @entity83 should never be an afterthought			0
it should be at the forefront of our minds , " @entity0 said while touting his @entity53 endorsement for governor and " a " rating during his 17 years in @entity87			0
the governor said the law " will protect the constitutional rights of @entity93 who have gone through a background check to legally obtain a @entity96			2
" roughly 500,000 @entity1 citizens have a permit of this kind , which is approximately 5 percent of our population			0
license holders have passed background checks and are in good standing with the law			0
this law gives added protections to those who have played by the rules -- and who can protect themselves and others from those who do n't play by the rules			0
" @entity33 opposed the original bill that @entity23 pushed for , and while the group is pleased that the version deal signed wednesday does n't allow guns on college campuses or in churches , except in certain cases , it feels the legislation " takes @entity1 out of the mainstream			1
" " among its many extreme provisions , it allows guns in @entity128 lines at the country 's busiest airport , forces community school boards into bitter , divisive debates about whether they should allow guns in their children 's classrooms , and broadens the conceal carry eligibility to people who have previously committed crimes with guns , " said @entity122 , the group 's senior adviser			2
" so it is no surprise that while being trumpeted by the @entity53 as the ' most comprehensive ' gun bill in state history , the legislation ... was opposed by @entity1 law enforcement , county commissioners , municipal leaders , and the @entity128 for its potentially harmful impact on @entity93 ' safety			1
" while the bill says no one is allowed to carry a firearm past an airport 's security screening checkpoint , it allows guns in other areas , including " an airport drive , general parking area , walkway , or shops and areas of the terminal that are outside the screening checkpoint			1
" @entity128 spokesman @entity164 would not say how the law might affect its agents at @entity1 airports , particularly @entity168 's , the world 's busiest , but he said , " individuals who bring firearms to security checkpoints are referred to law enforcement and are subject to criminal penalties			1
however , @entity128 has the ability to impose a civil penalty			0
" another provision of the new law allows firearms into any government building that is open for business and does n't have security personnel restricting access or screening visitors			2
some critics have said it was hypocritical to allow guns in so many places but not the state @entity188			2
@entity0 addressed that perception in a question from reporters , saying the @entity188 fell under a wider statewide provision that affects many government buildings , and it 's " a uniform carved - out area all across our state			1
" the law also allows @entity93 to carry guns into bars and churches as long as the property owner has n't banned them			1
anyone bringing a gun into a church that prohibits them wo n't be arrested but could pay a fine up to $ 100 , the law says			2
@entity209 church to give away @entity210 semi-automatic rifle one church that wo n't be allowing parishioners to carry weapons is @entity168 's historic @entity215 , which remembers well the 1974 shooting deaths of a deacon and @entity218 , the rev. @entity220 's mother , in its sanctuary			1
the rev. @entity222 , the church 's senior pastor , said a deranged man who had access to guns but not health care was behind that shooting , a circumstance that still resonates today			1
the shooting would have been even more tragic " had everyone been packing that day , " @entity222 said			0
" the message of today 's bill signing is very clear : our politicians , tragically , are owned by the gun lobby , " he said			1
" no one asked for this bill but the gun lobby , and still , we 're here			0
... we will remind them in november that they work for the people			0
" most churches throughout the state are focused on social issues , such as better health care and education , @entity222 said			2
" i do n't know of a single pastor in the @entity1 who has been lobbying to have guns brought into their churches , " he said			2
" when we say pass the peace , we mean p - e - a - @entity251 , not the @entity252 " the law will also allow the carrying of firearms by any " duly authorized official of a public or private elementary or secondary school or a public or private technical school , vocational school , college , university , or other institution of post-secondary education or a local board of education			2
" deal also touted how @entity266 would allow soldiers to obtain a carry license at age 18 if they 've completed basic training and are either actively serving or have been honorably discharged			0
" if they 're old enough to hold a gun in defense of our liberties , then they 're old enough to hold a gun , and they should n't have to wait until they 're 21			0
" other notable provisions of the law allow hunters to use silencers and suppressors when the owner of the property where they 're hunting is aware they 're using such a device ; permit gun owners who have had their licenses revoked to apply for a new license after three years ; restrict access for anyone whom a court has deemed mentally incompetent or insane , or anyone involuntary committed to a mental institution ; and forbid police officers who see a resident carrying a gun to ask for their permit unless they 're committing a crime			0
opinion : we will fight the @entity53 with common sense			0
