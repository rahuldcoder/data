-- it may not have been a great game until after the lights went out and came back up , but the @entity5 showdown sunday night created quite a few memorable moments on the field and off , even before kickoff			1
there were powerful performances , including a much buzzed - about halftime show by superstar @entity12			1
but there was also a lack of electricity in the stadium and in some of the commercials			1
and @entity20 fans are sure to get emotional over that last play they ran on offense , when two players met in the end zone and , despite interference , the referee did not call a penalty			1
here are the five moments you can expect your coworkers to talk about monday morning			1
@entity31 the men may have duked it out during the game , but when it came to the non-football entertainment at the @entity38 , women ruled the day			1
first up was @entity39 with a stirring rendition of " @entity41			1
" the choir backing her was composed of students from @entity45 , the @entity46 school where 20 students and six school staff were shot dead in december			1
players on the sidelines and fans in the stands wiped away tears			1
" our wish is to demonstrate to @entity57 and the world that ' we are @entity59 and we choose @entity60 , ' " the choir said in a statement			1
next , @entity61 belted out the " @entity67 " as the children , in white polo shirts with green ribbons pinned to them , stood with their hands on their hearts			1
but i just cried , " tweeted actor @entity70 about the @entity59 performance			1
the big show , however , came once the 49ers and the @entity74 got through the first half			1
for 12 minutes , she rocked the stage clad in above - the - knee black stiletto boots and a leather minidress			1
powered by an all - female backing band , there was little doubt @entity12 sang live -- unlike during president @entity84 's inauguration last month where she admitted singing along with a prerecorded track			2
and as if that was n't enough girl power for the night , @entity12 was joined by her @entity89 bandmates , @entity90 and @entity91			2
" watching the @entity92 with family & friends			2
@ @entity12 was phenomenal ! i am so proud of her ! - mo , " tweeted none other than the first lady of the @entity57 , @entity97			2
she was n't the only one			2
@entity12 's performance generated 5.5 million tweets ! lack of power for the first two quarters , the @entity74 seemed unstoppable , steamrolling the 49ers and building a 28 - 6 lead			2
but then , half the lights in the @entity38 went black			2
monitoring equipment sensed an abnormality in the building 's electrical system and cut power to some sectors to isolate the issue			2
power utility @entity113 said the problem was a " customer issue			2
" the @entity116 released a statement saying it was " investigating			2
" the power company said it was not to blame and that electricity in the rest of the city was fine			2
the outage left players , coaches and fans to wait , wait and wait some more			2
after 35 minutes , when the lights slowly went back on , so did @entity129 -- prompting many to wonder if the break in play played to the 49ers advantage			1
running back @entity133 felt differently			2
" you have to wait			2
football is a game of adjustments			1
the elements do n't matter , " he told @entity116			0
" i 've been saying it all year , the elements do n't matter in football			0
you 've just got to learn how to make adjustments			0
" the real mvp ? quarterbacks often get the glory in the @entity5 , but wide receiver @entity147 had a strong case for @entity149			1
he lost out to @entity150			0
@entity147 scored on two of the most incredible plays in @entity5 history , including a record 108 - yard kickoff return			1
it took him just 11 seconds on the clock to slice through the 49ers coverage team			0
" @entity147 's been a blessing to this team , " said @entity74 coach @entity159			1
" we 're grateful to have him on this team			0
" @entity147 , who grew up in @entity164 , also caught a 56 - yard touchdown pass -- his only reception			1
he fell , got up , decked a defender and sprinted at an angle toward the goal line , beating two 49ers into the end zone			1
" everybody dreams of scoring a touchdown in the @entity5			0
but two of ' em ? that 's what 's up ! " @entity147 told @entity177			1
" it was always a goal to win a @entity5			0
to come home and do it , that 's the icing on the cake			0
" @entity147 is definitely the mvp for some @entity183 who bought furniture this weekend at a @entity183 store			1
the @entity186 reported @entity187 promised to wipe out the charges for anything purchased on saturday or sunday if the @entity74 returned a kick for a touchdown to start a half			0
probably seemed like a good bet at the time			0
grading the ads some of the @entity5 commercials -- 30 second ads that cost upward of $ 4 million -- made us weep for different reasons			1
there were quite a few that played on our sentiment , from @entity211 's " @entity210 " to @entity209 's @entity204 - narrated " @entity57 will be @entity205 " to @entity207 's ode , " @entity208			0
" then there was the racy @entity214 ad that made us want to cry , burn our eyes out and have the @entity216 wipe out our memories			0
in it , model @entity218 shares a long kiss with a red - cheeked " nerd " that prompted its own hashtag : # @entity214			0
" oh my gosh those kissing noises , " tweeted @entity226 college student @entity225			0
a no - call to rue @entity20 fans will tell you they were robbed of a possible win when referees failed to call a penalty			0
in the final quarter , @entity129 quarterback @entity235 attempted a pass to the @entity20 ' @entity238 in the end zone			1
what happened next depends on who 's doing the talking			0
@entity20 ' fans will say @entity244 deliberately interfered with @entity238 , making it impossible to catch the ball			0
@entity74 ' fans will say it does n't matter , the ball was too high for @entity238 to catch			0
@entity20 ' fans will say a penalty call should have given the team a first down and a great chance to take the lead with less than two minutes left in the game			1
@entity74 ' fans will say the ball was uncatchable -- that it sailed way over @entity238 's head			0
but if you ask @entity260 wide receiver @entity259 , there should have been a penalty flag , even if the ball seemed like it was too high to catch			0
" for all y'all saying that ball was uncatchable for @entity238 in the endzone ... @entity266 ! ! because dude held thee sh * t outta him ... " he tweeted			0
@entity238 told @entity270 it was " a missed call			0
" " i do n't want to talk about it , " he said			0
" i do n't want to think about it			0
" that 's ok , the 49ers fans will likely do it for him			0
@entity0 's @entity278 contributed to this report .			0
