it 's been a big week for dinosaurs			2
with " @entity3 " still rampaging at the box office , @entity2 also rolled out some privacy changes along with a friendly blue dino to help explain them all			1
in addition to making settings for all new users default to " friends only , " @entity2 announced thursday it will prompt existing users to review their privacy settings			1
your new guide to the intricacies of controlling your personal info on the world 's biggest social platform ? a blue cartoon dinosaur with a snaggletooth , tapping away at a laptop that looks like some kind of @entity24			1
" hi ! " reads one of the new pop - up windows , presumably relaying the sentiments of the new @entity29 spirit animal			0
you have n't changed who can see your post lately , so we just wanted to make sure you 're sharing this post with the right audience			0
it 's part of an effort that @entity2 has been undertaking for months to clarify and tighten privacy settings , something critics have dinged the site for in the past			1
but why a dinosaur ? " our team looked at a few different characters , saw the dinosaur , and just thought he was the friendliest and best choice , " said @entity42 , an engineering manager on @entity2 's privacy team			1
" once we tried him out , we saw some great results and welcomed him to the team			0
" dubbed the " @entity58 " by @entity52 in a nod to @entity2 ceo @entity54 , the ( thankfully ) un-barney - like creature joins an ever - growing pantheon of tech mascots			1
from @entity64 's smiley , leggy tv guy to @entity62 's android , there has been no shortage of cutesy characters introduced by @entity68 and tech companies to reinforce brand identity or help set themselves apart from the masses			2
as a species , they 've provoked a wide variety of reactions			0
some , like @entity77 's beloved @entity76 , the @entity79 bird and the early @entity68 butler invoke warm feelings among users			1
even @entity79 's " @entity85 , " which showed up years ago whenever the platform was over capacity , had its fans			2
other mascots were n't so lucky			0
@entity91 , @entity90 's talking paper clip , became one of the computing age 's most mocked , if not reviled , characters			1
early @entity96 users were forced to click him out of existence over and over again as he popped up to give advice of sometimes questionable value			0
plus , he 's a talking paper clip			0
then - ceo @entity102 retired @entity91 in 2001 , though he was brought back in 2011 for a @entity104 tutorial -- but only if users chose him			1
then there was the @entity108 sock puppet			0
amusing enough at first , the puppet 's schtick had already started getting old by 2001 , when the site went belly up , its once - ballyhooed stock worth a whopping 22 cents a share			0
will @entity2 's privacy dino catch on ? or will he ( or she ) be mocked into extinction ? only time will tell			2
on @entity79 , some users friday were calling the creature a " safeasaur " or a " privasaurus			2
" the @entity52 said the @entity58 " could suffer the cruel fate of other tech industry cartoon characters if @entity2 slips on its promise to be more mindful of users ' privacy			1
" meanwhile , we 'll just be thankful it 's not purple .			0

a new privacy tutorial for @entity2 users features a blue cartoon dinosaur
the @entity52 is calling it the " @entity58 "
the character was " the friendliest and best choice , " engineer says
it joins a list of tech mascots from @entity77 's @entity76 to @entity90 's *annoying* @entity91
