@entity0 , @entity1 -- to feel the vibrancy of @entity0 , all you have to do is step out onto a bustling city street			1
step to it : walking through the city 's streets is the best way to see it			1
negotiating the roads , chock full of motorbikes and an increasing number of cars , can be daunting			1
but copy the fearless locals -- they do n't break stride and never retreat -- and put your fate in the hands , or throttle , of the city 's drivers who seems masterful at avoiding each other			1
a good place to kick off a visit is on one of the main drags , @entity26 , a street that runs through the heart of the city			1
near one end is the picturesque @entity32 , as well as the majestic @entity33 or " @entity36 " ( this is still a communist country of course )			2
you should n't have to do too much motorbike dodging down @entity38 and after just a 15 minute stroll from @entity33 is the famed @entity40			1
however give yourself more time to stop into galleries or buy a classic piece of communist propaganda along the way			2
the hundreds of stalls at @entity40 offer a mix of traditional culture and tourist kitsch			1
you can sit with the locals and sip a solid jolt of @entity1 coffee then move on to shopping for touristy t - shirts and " authentic chopsticks "			2
many of the stalls feature signs saying the prices are fixed			2
but if you 're prepared to drive a hard bargain , or buy in bulk , that idea can be amended			2
it 's also worth a return trip later on in the evening when the market closes and street side restaurants spring up , offering great meals at cheap prices			2
if you 're looking to get away from the strip of @entity70 hotels in the city center , hail a cab and head over to @entity74 , or @entity0 's @entity75			1
in the late 18th century , this enclave was actually a separate city from old @entity0 but the two were united in the early 1930 's			1
today @entity74 is home to the @entity80 , which the locals call " @entity74			0
" just do n't confuse it with @entity83 , or you 'll be right back where you started			0
the area is filled with plenty of local color and is a photographer 's dream			1
despite mass consumption of bottled water and the finest sunscreen , you 'll need to find a way to beat the heat in @entity0			1
one of the best ways is to make regular stops at any restaurant or caf√© for a refreshing lime soda			1
a bowl of the traditional @entity100 ( pronounced " fuh " ) is also a must			0
it 's said that this simple dish -- consisting of noodles , beef and broth -- was created at food stalls in @entity108 nearly a century ago			1
but even in @entity0 you need to walk only a few feet before coming across a food joint claiming to serve the city 's best pho			1
in a place with stifling heat and the motorbike madness , an afternoon rest is a wise move , especially if you want to partake in the nightlife			1
another dose of @entity1 coffee will surely have you revived in no time			0
or , if you 're in need of some pampering , try a foot massage at any of the countless establishments -- to play it safe and avoid " additional services " get a suggestion from any hotel concierge			0
is @entity0 the most exciting city in @entity128 for a short break ? have you say in the " @entity131 " box below			1
if you 're keen to try to play foreign correspondent -- or at least see where they gathered during the days of the @entity134 - look no further than the @entity135 on @entity136			0
the drinks are wildly overpriced and the crowd seems to be on the " 5 @entity128 cities in 7 days " tour , but its large rooftop does offer a great bird 's eye view of the lively streets below			0
the nearby @entity145 on @entity146 offers a quieter setting for a cocktail			0
diners also give great reviews for the food			2
afterwards , stroll over to @entity152 's on @entity153			0
the @entity155 colonial style building features bands playing away upstairs with large lounges on the veranda , while downstairs you can settle in for a more mellow night			0
if your 24 hours in @entity0 happens to turn into 36 or 48 , arrange a day trip to the @entity161 , about 70 kilometers @entity162 of the city			2
the @entity164 built this maze of passageways , which served as supply lines , during the @entity134			0
the narrow tunnels snake underground for a staggering 200 kilometers			0
not only can you take a stroll , or crawl , through a few parts of it , you 'll also be served a unique dose of communist propaganda			0
most trips to @entity176 also include a stop at the very colorful and unique @entity178 in @entity179			0
if these options do n't hit the mark , you can always accept an offer from one of the countless " moto drivers			0
" they 'll have you on the back of their bike and whizzing through the streets in no time			0
and maybe close your eyes .			0

the city is *buzzing* with motorbikes , so be quick to get up to speed
all the sights , smells and color of the city can be found around @entity40
take a break from the heat and *traffic* with regular pit stops for *delicious* local food
