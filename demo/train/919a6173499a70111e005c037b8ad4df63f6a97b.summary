-- a friend of mine who works in advertising recently got called for a job in @entity5 , @entity6			0
knowing i have traveled in the @entity8 , she asked me if she should take it			0
i said it might be interesting in terms of cultural anthropology , but do n't expect to enjoy yourself			2
the social and legal restrictions on women are rampant			2
in the end she turned it down , and one big reason was her trepidation about how she would be treated			0
@entity23 women work in the notoriously misogynistic @entity24 , mostly in pr for governments and doing business with multinationals			2
but the biggest contingent of foreign women working in those countries -- the millions of @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity34 servants -- are off the radar			1
the events of this past week should be regarded as their , and the native women 's , silent scream			1
@entity39 , an interior designer working in @entity40 , reported being raped last year while on a business trip to @entity42			1
although her alleged attacker was arrested and jailed , so was she			0
a court sentenced her to 16 months in prison for having unlawful sex			2
world outrage at the kafkaesque situation apparently provoked the @entity42 potentate @entity50 to " pardon " @entity39			1
she gets her passport back and is free to go home			0
she told reporters in @entity42 she planned to get out soon			1
the incident should be a wake - up call for any woman , and any man who cares about women , working in or doing business with the petro - cash soaked @entity24			1
it is a reminder to us that no matter how many glittery skyscrapers they build , no matter how many jewels of @entity23 culture they attract -- the @entity71 , @entity72 and @entity73 in the @entity74 , for example -- their laws are stacked against women			1
to convict a rapist in the @entity74 , he must confess or at least four @entity79 men who witnessed the rape must come forward			2
@entity82 's government helped negotiate @entity39 's release , perhaps motivated by the 72,000 signatures collected by outraged @entity85			2
that is not always the case			2
in 2008 , an @entity89 woman who reported being gang - raped served eight months in jail			1
in december 2012 , a @entity92 woman reported being raped by three men in @entity42 and was found guilty of drinking alcohol without a license and fined			1
in january 2010 , a @entity92 woman reported being raped by an employee at a @entity42 hotel			1
she was charged with public intoxication and having sex outside of marriage			0
@entity102 thanked the emir for pardoning her ( for what , exactly ? ) , but royal forgiveness of a rape victim is not enough			2
we ought to be pressuring the leaders of @entity42 , and other @entity24 , all the time , and not just when foreign women are victims			1
the @entity110 , incredibly , has had three female secretaries of state in a row who never put this issue on the table despite many meetings with kings and princes			0
we should be applying much more political and diplomatic pressure on these countries to give women their basic human rights			1
we should also be supporting the brave women in these countries fighting for change			0
a slender young @entity6 woman named @entity128 has been courageously fighting for women 's right to drive in the @entity130			1
the rich and powerful nation where she lives and works forbids women from driving by refusing to grant them driver 's licenses and arrests those who do drive			1
the @entity6 ' justifications include the risible statements from religious muftis who preach that driving is a gateway activity to promiscuous sex			0
the real reason women @entity6 forbids women from driving is that the law regards them as children for life			0
females remain legally under male " guardianship " from cradle to grave in the @entity24 theocracies			0
mobility profoundly threatens that lopsided intimate power structure			0
in 2011 , our nation 's 14 female @entity110 senators signed a letter urging @entity6 to let women drive			1
should n't there have been 100 senators ' signatures -- male and female -- on such a letter ? in any other circumstance where biased laws affected men , too , we would see a more coordinated response			0
what if a nation forbade an ethnic group from driving , forced its members to walk about in blankets in desert heat and criminalized them for being victims of violence ? absolute power , as the saying goes , corrupts absolutely			0
the abysmal state of gender relations in the theocracies includes girls in their early teens forced into marriage , rampant and unreported domestic violence and -- as in the @entity191 case -- laws that offer no protection for rape victims but instead make them criminals			1
the @entity196 has n't done much for women anywhere in the @entity199 world , and least of all in the @entity24 , which have avoided any revolutionary activity by crushing dissent and jailing people without charge			1
@entity42 , with its cool , gleaming skyscrapers , has earned a reputation as a playground for the world 's wealthiest people			1
@entity210 , owned by the @entity40 princes , is a reputable news organization not just in @entity212 but in @entity213 as well			0
the trouble is that these visible advancements are attached to medieval attitudes toward women			0
and the real victims are not @entity23 women , who can come and go at will , but the millions of powerless women who live in those countries			0
@entity39 -- blond , @entity223 and educated -- gets to go home to her mother and friends in @entity82			0
how many female rape victims are languishing in the emirs ' and sheikhs ' jails or ostracized by society for life or suffering in silence for the " crime " of having been sexually assaulted ? our silence is a measure of the power of petro - dollars and a powerful signal about where women 's human rights rank on the world stage			1
until and unless @entity246 leaders start making some pro-female changes , women invited to work in these countries should boycott all job offers			0
maybe if the emirs are isolated in their all - male 21st century utopia , they will begin to change			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity255 .			2

@entity255 : case of woman sentenced to jail in @entity42 for reporting rape is not *unusual*
*westerners* can leave , she says , but @entity199 women and foreign servants must stay and endure
she says @entity196 has n't done much for women : do n't be *fooled* by *modern* skyscrapers
@entity271 : the power of petro - dollars fuels our silence , shows we fail on global women 's rights
