separately , the @entity15 voted by a wide margin to allow gays and lesbians to become bishops , @entity14 reported			0
both measures must be approved by the church 's @entity21 before taking effect , but expert @entity24 said there is " little reason " to think the changes will not " sail through			1

the vote shows the @entity1 " striving to actually become the church former presiding bishop @entity54 called us to be nearly 20 years ago now ... a church where there are no outcasts , " she said in a statement on the group 's web site			1
the @entity1 created controversy in 2003 with its decision to ordain @entity8 , who is openly gay , as a bishop			1

the @entity1 , the @entity71 branch of the @entity67 , has not ordained another openly gay bishop since @entity8			1

but monday 's vote ends what had been , in effect , a moratorium , he said			0
it was the @entity1 saying that " this was n't an anomaly when we elected @entity8			2
