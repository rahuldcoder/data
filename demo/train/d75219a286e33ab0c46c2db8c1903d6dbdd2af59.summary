-- the emergence of @entity2 , the leader in the newish field of online crowd - funding , has been a paradigm - shifting boon for artists and other creators looking for a new way to bankroll projects that might otherwise never have happened			1
but as the popularity of the site , and others like @entity16 , increases , users have been asking : what happens when i donate to a project but then the recipient never follows through ? this week , the site said that while that rarely happens , there 's not much they can do about it when it does			1
" @entity2 does not investigate a creator 's ability to complete their project , " a team of @entity2 's top officers said in a blog post			1
" backers ultimately decide the validity and worthiness of a project by whether they decide to fund it			2
" the tuesday post came in response to an @entity41 piece that highlighted the site 's inability to guarantee that users will deliver on their promises			1
the site does review projects before publishing them online , but only to insure that they meet @entity2 's guidelines			1
@entity2 says more than 2 million donors have funded nearly 30,000 projects since 2009			1
the site requires projects have a clear goal ( a specific product as opposed to , say , starting a business ) , fit into one of the site 's mainly arts - related categories and not fall into its broadly defined " prohibited content " clause			1
( this being the @entity66 , we 're presuming they 're mostly taking about porn )			0
the bottom line , @entity2 says , is that the donor needs to weigh the reliability and honesty of the person they are pledging money to , as well as their ability to deliver what 's promised			1
the site began as a haven for independent artists seeking help to make a dream a reality -- be it an independent film , @entity88 release , book , play or video game			2
but as its popularity grew , many @entity2 campaigns began to resemble business transactions more than creators looking for a helping hand			1
in august , a project to build an open - source gaming console raised $ 8.6 million			2
@entity99 , an already successful webcomic , raised more than a half - million dollars to make its site ad - free			2
the @entity103 , a watch that works with @entity105 and @entity107 operating systems , was pledged more than $ 10.2 million			0
while projects like those do fall under @entity2 's guidelines , they 've helped create situations in which donors think of themselves more as customers than helpers , and the " gifts " they get for donating as merchandise they 're owed			1
@entity119 was featured in the @entity41 piece			0
his project , the @entity123 case , was successfully funded in february			2
nearly seven months later , no cases have been shipped after a string of complications			0
he says he 's given refunds to several backers who asked for them , but still plans to complete production			0
@entity119 , to his credit , has actively worked to explain what 's going on			0
the responses he 's gotten from backers on the campaign 's page shows the split in the mindset of those who gave			0
" i think this should be a lesson for any other @entity2 project you do ... , " wrote backer @entity141 on his project 's page			1
" i 've backed a lot of @entity2 projects and every one of them has delivered except this one			2
" others , however , were taking the delay in stride , saying they know that 's sometimes the nature of backing startups			0
" though my financial backing was minimal , my personal support was , and is strong , " a backer named @entity160 wrote in the same thread			0
" i believe i speak for many of your supporters when i say , keep us in the loop , your product is cool and versatile , and who knows what opportunities await ! " that 's the attitude @entity2 wants to encourage , even as it warns users to carefully consider before donating			1
" the number of creative projects that have been funded and produced on @entity2 in the past three years is enormous			1
many could not exist otherwise , " reads the blog post			0
" but of course not every project goes perfectly			2
delays do occur , especially with more complicated projects			0
some creators get in over their heads dealing with processes that are new to them			0
" most backers support projects because they want to see something happen and they 'd like to be a part of it			0
creators who are honest and transparent will usually find backers to be understanding			0

@entity2 urges users to *choose* wisely
most funded projects on the site are realized , but some hit complications
with site 's growth , some campaigns feel more like business transactions
@entity2 : " not every project goes perfectly "
