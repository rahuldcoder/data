-- the beheading of @entity3 journalist @entity2 by @entity5 militants has stirred grim memories , bringing into focus once again the risks faced by reporters in modern conflicts			1
@entity2 's death recalls the murder of @entity13 , the @entity14 correspondent who was kidnapped in @entity15 in 2002			1
videos of their killings were then posted online by extremist groups			0
in @entity23 's case , it was @entity24			2
in @entity2 's , it was @entity5 , a splinter group disowned by @entity24 earlier this year			1
' i wish i had more time ' in the video posted tuesday on @entity29 , @entity2 is seen kneeling next to a man dressed in black			2
@entity2 reads a message , presumably scripted by his captors , that his " real killer '' is @entity3			1
" i wish i had more time			0
i wish i could have the hope for freedom to see my family once again , " he can be heard saying in the video , which @entity0 is not airing			2
he is then shown being beheaded			0
@entity40 spokeswoman @entity39 said that intelligence agencies are " working as quickly as possible " to determine the video 's authenticity			0
" if genuine , we are appalled by the brutal murder of an innocent @entity3 journalist and we express our deepest condolences to his family and friends , " she said			1
shock waves from @entity23 murder the 2002 murder of @entity23 , only months after the september 11 attacks , provoked shock and revulsion around the world because of its brutality and the profession of its victim			0
" what it demonstrates is that the business of reporting on war has changed fundamentally , " the veteran war correspondent @entity61 wrote in the @entity62 following @entity23 's killing			1
" the powers that be in a conflict zone no longer regard the media as a neutral observer but rather as a strategic component -- something to be manipulated or co-opted or simply got rid of , " @entity61 wrote			0
but @entity23 's murder , and the worldwide attention it received , also " catalyzed the resurgence " of the beheading of captives by @entity81 militants , @entity74 , a historian , wrote in a 2005 article for the @entity76			0
during the @entity85 , militants decapitated three @entity3 -- the businessman @entity88 and construction company employees @entity86 and @entity89 -- as well as numerous other foreigners and countless @entity91			1
in @entity93 , @entity24 terrorists beheaded an @entity3 businessman , @entity94 , in 2004			2
@entity5 's brutality now , the focus is on @entity5 , which has become notorious for its savage practices in @entity98 and @entity91 , including putting victims ' severed heads on poles			1
the extremist group , which calls itself the @entity103 , has taken control of large areas of @entity98 and @entity91 , bringing with it ruthless slaughter of civilians and persecution of minorities			1
it has carried out executions , including beheadings , as part of its effort to establish an @entity81 caliphate that stretches from @entity98 into @entity91			1
in many cases , the group has videotaped the executions and posted them online			0
the @entity5 threat in northern @entity91 grew severe enough for the @entity3 to step in with airstrikes to help @entity122 and @entity91 forces			1
that decision apparently prompted @entity5 to retaliate with the brutal killing of @entity2 , who disappeared in northwest @entity98 in november 2012			1
" our hearts go out to the family of journalist @entity2			2
we know the horror they are going through , " said @entity23 's mother , @entity130 , according to a @entity132 post tuesday by the @entity133			0
message to @entity137 @entity5 has also threatened to kill another @entity3 journalist , who appears in the video showing @entity2 's death			1
the life of the other @entity3 -- believed to be @entity142 , who was kidnapped at the @entity98 - @entity91 border last year -- depends on what @entity3 president @entity137 does next , the militant in the video suggests			1
but @entity0 @entity3 security analyst @entity146 said he did n't expect the video would make the @entity137 administration change tack			1
" i do n't think the @entity149 is going to pull back on this , even though there probably will be more executions , as promised by @entity5 , " said @entity146 , a former @entity148 operative			1
" i think this was all foreseen when we started hitting targets in @entity91			2
" the @entity156 said it estimates that approximately 20 journalists , both local and international , are missing in @entity98			1
many of them are believed to be held by @entity5 , it said			1
at least 69 other journalists have been killed covering the war in @entity98 , according to the committee			2
among the missing is @entity164 , an @entity3 freelance journalist who was contributing articles to the @entity166			2
@entity164 disappeared in @entity98 in august 2012			2
there has been no word of from him since his abduction			0
some foreign journalists held captive in @entity98 have been released			1
would you watch the video ? ' shock value ' but @entity5 's decision to behead @entity2 and publicize it online is an ominous development			1
" the purpose of terrorism is to strike fear into the hearts of opponents in order to win political concession , " @entity74 wrote in his 2005 article on beheadings by @entity81 militants			0
" as the shock value wears off and the western world becomes immunized to any particular tactic , terrorists develop new ones in order to maximize shock and the press reaction upon which they thrive			0
" analysts have suggested that terrorists have used beheading previously because of its horrifying effect on the public			0
their acts have fueled debate about the significance of beheading in @entity81 history and theology			0
a @entity207 article on the subject in 2009 said that two apparent references to decapitation in the @entity215 " are traditionally understood as inspirations to ferocity and not literal calls for beheading			0
" the article also points out that decapitation has @entity218 roots , too			0
it was used for capital punishment in @entity221 , @entity222 and other @entity224 countries			0
it was also allowed in @entity226 in the 19th century			0
but it no longer exists as a punishment in the @entity229			0
in the @entity231 , beheading as an execution option remains part of the criminal legal codes in @entity93 , @entity234 , @entity235 and @entity236			0
but only @entity93 continues the practice			0
but @entity2 's savage killing at the hands of @entity5 did n't come after a trial by law			1
" @entity2 was an innocent civilian who was bravely performing his job as a journalist , " said sen. @entity242 , a @entity243 from @entity244 , the state where @entity2 grew up			2
" this barbaric and heinous act shocks the conscience and highlights the truly evil nature of the terrorists we confront			0
" @entity0 's @entity254 contributed to this report .			2

about 20 journalists are missing in @entity98 , many believed held by @entity5 , the @entity156 says
the brutal killing of @entity2 recalls the murders of @entity13 and others
@entity5 links @entity2 's killing to @entity3 airstrikes in @entity91 and threatens another @entity3 captive
" i do n't think the @entity149 is going to pull back on this , " a @entity0 security analyst says
