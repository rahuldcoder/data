-- on @entity4 's " @entity3 " on sunday , @entity2 attorney general @entity1 , who happens to be black , suggested that opposition to him and president @entity6 in part is due to racial animus			1
for that , he has been vilified			0
he has been accused of trying to scare people to the polls ( as if listening to the evening news would n't already do that ) , stoking racial divisions and throwing down the race card			2
and he is asked rhetorically " is it possible to oppose @entity6 and not be a racist ? " the response to the attorney general 's words has been very heated , and there is an obvious explanation			1
" @entity3 " allowed many whites to hear what a black man is thinking about race			1
most whites do n't know because most whites do n't have interracial conversations about race			2
to be fair , neither do most blacks			0
it 's just that we know what other blacks are thinking because , well , we talk to other blacks about race			1
" @entity3 " allowed a window into the thinking about race from a black person 's perspective			1
that is unusual , given the dearth of guests of color on shows such as " @entity3			0
" if anything , this points out the need for white @entity2 to hear more voices from people of color			0
but if you look at @entity1 's actual words , there really is n't anything surprising , or especially bold , in what he said			1
he said : " there 's a certain racial component to this for some people			2
i do n't think this is the thing that is a main driver , but for some , there 's a racial animus			1
" let 's review : he said " i do n't think this is the thing that is a main driver , " but it is as if when certain whites hear the word race ( or a derivative ) as the explanation for any part of an event , they go situationally deaf			1
poll after poll shows how blacks and whites view our country through different lenses			1
consider a recent @entity85 poll that asked whether the justice system was biased against blacks			0
while 69 % of whites answered no , 68 % of blacks answered yes			2
how does this happen ? because by and large when talking about race in @entity2 , whites have conversations with other whites and blacks have conversations with other blacks			2
what @entity1 said is very different from what whites who do n't talk to blacks generally hear			1
as i tell my students when i teach about race and the law , i note that important breakthroughs on race can only come when you have a conversation with someone who does n't look like you and does n't think like you			0
but this is not a level playing field			0
blacks and whites can look at the same event and come up with completely different perceptions			0
when a black person says this is about race , many whites say we 're playing the race card			2
but when a white person says this has nothing to do with race , rarely does he or she ever get called on it			0
in this case , @entity1 , a black man , very gently said race could ... maybe ... possibly have something to do with a piece of it , and look at what happened			1
let 's take a few examples that to me show unprecedented hostility directed toward the president , in my opinion , because he is black			0
first , the utter nonsense about the president 's birth certificate ; it refuses to die -- it is actively kept alive -- despite all the evidence to the contrary			0
second , the number of pictures or posters at rallies with the president 's face on a monkey 's body			0
third , congressman @entity155 yells " you lie " during the president 's @entity157			0
if anything , @entity1 was too tepid in his analysis , but i 'm sure that 's a function of his knowing that whenever he says anything about race , he gets pummeled			1
the real lesson for me is the paucity of guests with the same views as @entity1 who are given a national platform the way that he was			1
if week after week , on issue after issue , blacks were invited on as guests and allowed to inform the discussion , after a while , there would be fewer and fewer instances of situational deafness			0
whites would come to understand that there is more than one way of looking at something -- especially when it comes to race -- and when it comes to race , would not ignore the expertise that lies in black voices .			2

attorney general @entity1 said " racial animus " in part drives opposition to @entity6
@entity195 : for saying what a black man is thinking about race , @entity1 's now being vilified
@entity195 : his remarks were mild , not *shocking* ; whites too rarely get perspectives of blacks
@entity195 : it 's not often that someone with @entity1 's point of view has national platform
