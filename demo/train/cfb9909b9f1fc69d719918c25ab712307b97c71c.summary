@entity0 says it will " pause " its closely watched project to drill for oil off the @entity5 coast this year , instead spending 2013 preparing for future exploration			1
the company began work in the @entity10 and @entity11 seas in the remote @entity12 this summer			1
the project caused widespread concern among environmentalists and suffered some high - profile snags , including the grounding of a drill barge that was being towed back to the @entity19			0
" @entity5 remains an area with high potential for @entity0 over the long term , and the company is committed to drill there again in the future , " a corporate statement issued wednesday afternoon declared			1
but @entity0 said it would take time off this year " to prepare equipment and plans for a resumption of activity at a later stage			1
" @entity0 began preparatory drilling on two wells in september and october			1
before the work began , the drill ship @entity35 slipped its mooring and drifted toward shore in the @entity39 , though it remained afloat			0
then on @entity42 , the drill @entity41 had to be cut loose in a severe storm while being towed back to its winter home port in @entity46			0
it ran aground on an uninhabited island about 200 miles south of @entity49 and was stuck there for a week before being refloated			0
@entity0 said both vessels are now being towed to @entity51 for maintenance and repairs			2
the incidents sharpened concerns about @entity0 's plans to drill in the @entity12 , both among environmentalists and in native alaskan communities			1
the @entity59 , a leading environmental group , called @entity0 's decision wise under the circumstances			1
" throughout the 2012 season , @entity0 's experience proved time and time again the inherent difficulties in meeting challenging @entity12 conditions and the safety standards required by the federal government , " @entity62 , the group 's managing director for the region , said in a written statement			1
the company 's decision " should be heeded by others in the industry as they re-examine their future in this inhospitable environment			0
" and @entity79 , the @entity80 's director of @entity5 projects , said the @entity87 administration should " learn from this experience , step into the ring and end this folly once and for all -- before the next accident happens			2
" sen. @entity88 , the ranking member of the @entity91 's energy and natural resources committee , said that she continues to support @entity0 's plans and that the suspension was evidence of the company 's commitment to safety			1
" i have always said that it must be done to the highest safety standards , " the @entity5 @entity97 said			0
" this pause -- and it is only a pause in a multi-year drilling program that will ultimately provide great benefits both to the state of @entity5 and the nation as a whole -- is necessary for @entity0 to repair its ships and make the necessary updates to its exploration plans that will ensure a safe return to exploration soon			1
" the plans were held up after @entity113 's 2010 @entity112 disaster in the @entity114			0
@entity0 says it 's working at far less depth and lower pressures than the @entity113 well that erupted nearly a mile beneath the @entity114 , killing 11 men on board a rig and unleashing an undersea gusher that took three months to cap			2
" @entity5 holds important energy resources , " the company said wednesday			0
" at the same time , securing access to those resources requires special expertise , technology and an in - depth understanding of the environmental and societal sensitivities unique to the region			2
" the @entity132 estimates more than 90 billion barrels of oil and nearly 1,700 trillion cubic feet of natural gas may be recoverable by drilling in the @entity137 area			0
shrinking of the region 's sea ice -- which hit record lows in 2012 -- has created new opportunities for energy exploration in the region			0
" the causes of last year 's mishaps must be remedied so they do not occur in the future , " @entity145 , director of the @entity147 ' @entity12 program , said in an e-mail			2
she called on the federal government and oil companies to meet with environmental groups to " develop world - class industry standards and ecological and cultural protections to safeguard the @entity12			1
" climate researchers say that a decrease in sea ice is a symptom of a warming climate , caused largely by the combustion of carbon - rich fossil fuels			0
the research is politically controversial but generally accepted as fact by most scientists .			0

one environmental group says company should " end this folly "
@entity0 wo *n't* resume @entity12 drilling in 2013
company taking the year " to prepare equipment and plans " for another time
project had been widely *criticized* by environmental groups
