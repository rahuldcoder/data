@entity0 -- this is the story of two entrepreneurs with two very different interests			2
one thing they have in common : both took major risks and started a business in the middle of the global financial crisis			1
what was the motivation ? for @entity14 , january 2009 was a low point			1
he was laid off and divorced that month			1
he had been an investment banker for @entity16 , whose bankruptcy in september 2008 catalyzed the financial crisis			0
this was not supposed to happen to a @entity21 grad armed with an mba from @entity23			0
" i started interviewing for jobs at private equity firms and five weeks into it , i realized i was n't really in love with the job or the industry anymore , " @entity14 says			1
so he did what most entrepreneurs do			0
he networked with friends , brainstormed and came up with a business idea that embraced his passion : martial arts			1
@entity14 , who grew up in @entity36 and @entity0 , has practiced martial arts his whole life			1
he wanted to start a mixed martial arts company in @entity40 for @entity40 - @entity42 fighters			1
he and a friend @entity43 , who was ready to leave his job at @entity45 , sold all their possessions , put up their own seed capital and set up the business			1
@entity50 was born in july 2009			0
" we saw that @entity40 was doing better than the rest of the world , looking to recover faster and we saw that trends in entertainment , the growth of the middle class , the deregulation of media			0
those all sort of pointed in my mind to a much more favorable environment than ever before to start a sports media - oriented business , " @entity14 says			1
two and a half years later , legend has carved a niche for itself in the mixed martial arts world			1
they will put on their eighth major championship at the end of march in @entity72			1
initially , their revenues came from ticket sales			0
today , it 's a combination of television licensing , sponsorships , ad sales and ticket sales			0
@entity81 is their biggest revenue market followed by @entity84 and @entity85			0
@entity14 says he sees a surge of interest in the @entity88 , @entity89 and @entity90			1
taking the risk @entity92 found a problem and started a business to solve it			1
after living in @entity0 for four years , the 27 - year - old discovered it was difficult to find good quality food - especially meat - at affordable prices			1
he had worked in corporate real estate for @entity100 but was getting the itch to start his own business			1
he and two friends came up with the concept for @entity105 , a delivery service of fresh ingredients for ready - to - cook dishes with the cooking instructions included			1
one selling point is all the meats and fish are imported from @entity85 and @entity113			0
they pooled their own money together for $ 100,000 to start up the business			2
they rented an old print shop , converted it into a test kitchen and spent several months trying out different recipes			0
" the success of our business depends on logistics , " @entity92 says			2
that means figuring out how to deliver the meals during crunch dinner time in a busy city like @entity0			2
@entity105 uses couriers on foot , vans and mopeds			0
after about 250 test meals -- mostly with friends -- @entity105 launched last fall in @entity0			2
since then , @entity135 says the young business is close to serving its 1000th meal			1
one regular client is @entity139 , a vice president of human resources at @entity141			0
" i work really long hours from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. it 's the time question for me ... the price point is really reasonable , " she says			0
" my meals average hk $ 250 ( us $ 32 ) for two people			2
i think that 's good for the quality of food , ease and time it saves you			2
" both legend and @entity105 started in a period of global economic fragility			2
what made @entity14 believe investors would buy into the niche idea of setting up mixed martial arts fights and that the public would pay good money to see a fight ? " economies go through cycles and if you 're always waiting for the perfect time to do something then you might miss the opportunity , " @entity14 explains			1
@entity135 says , " i think in our case , the timing and all the chips kind of fell into place			1
it was less the macro ( situation ) and more the timing of our individual lives that made it work			0
" his two partners bring different skills to the table			0
one is a former lawyer and the other is a chef who used to run a private kitchen in @entity0			0
lessons learned both businesses benefited from running a lean business from the start			2
legend started out in @entity14 's small @entity0 apartment			1
" we paid an intern to work from our dining room table , " @entity14 said			1
in order to decide which fighters to invite to championships , @entity14 and his partner do their initial research by watching fight videos on the internet			1
then they fly to the fighter 's home country to meet and hammer out individual contracts			0
between @entity105 's three co-founders , they have a large social network of friends to spread the word			0
" we do n't have very much of an advertising budget , " says @entity92			0
they utilize @entity212 and have dabbled in @entity214 advertising			0
they 've also bartered with friends in public relations : free meals for free @entity219			2
one unexpected lesson for @entity105 was realizing the timing of their launch was not ideal			0
they opened for business a few months before @entity226 and @entity227 when many new customers leave @entity0 for the holidays			2
" being in the food business , holidays are your big enemy which seems counterintuitive , " says @entity92			2
neither legend nor @entity105 will say whether they 're profitable or breaking even at the moment			0
the one thing the founders will say is they 're glad they went against conventional thinking and took the plunge			0
" i knew this was a good idea			0
i trusted myself and ultimately , i think it 's paid off , " says @entity14 .			1
