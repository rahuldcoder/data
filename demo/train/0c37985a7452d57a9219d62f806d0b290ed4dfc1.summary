@entity0 , @entity1 -- " @entity7 " is how @entity3 remembers the moment he logged on to @entity5 and discovered he was beating nearly two million other competitors			1
tough task : managing a fantasy football team can be hard when you want to get ahead of the rest			1
it 's the stuff dreams are made of for the millions of people managing fantasy football teams in online leagues around the world every year			1
but in most players ' experience , for one reason or another , the glory of victory always remains just out of reach			1
it 's hardly surprising , given that this year alone 1.9 million fiercely competitive fans played the game billed as " the ultimate @entity28			2
" so , then , what separates the players who get to the top from all the rest ? is it instinct , or , maybe knowledge , or is it simply old - fashioned good luck ? @entity3 , who is @entity37 , went on to win the @entity5 in 2007/2008 , beating hundreds of thousands of would - be managers both from @entity1 and around the globe in the process			1
it was the fourth year he had played the game and he says he was surprised to remain so competitive through the season			0
" really only in the last couple of years i have been in the top 200 or so			0
i was nowhere near the leaders before that			0
" @entity3 felt striking a balance between superstars and cheaper players was crucial to his fantasy football success -- as was a bit of luck			1
" having a well balanced side with not too many superstars is important			1
i think you need to pick three or four players who you feel are undervalued and take a chance on them			1
" do you have any @entity28 tips ? share your ideas in the @entity61 box below			2
for @entity3 , taking a chance on players like @entity65 's @entity64 and @entity66 of @entity67 paid off -- and he found himself still around the top 100 by mid-season			2
there were a couple of other tactics that helped @entity3 rise to the top			0
" i think it happened after i started watching a few more games on television			0
i got to see first - hand who was playing , what form they were in and i learned a lot from there			0
having a good knowledge of all the players across all of the teams is really important			1
" checking teams for injuries and selections close to the deadline was also important , he said			2
seven weeks out from the end of the 2007/2008 season , @entity3 hit the lead and managed to hold on for the rest of the season			0
" i came out of nowhere really			0
there was one week where i just logged on to check my team and i found myself in front			0
" from out in front , @entity3 said the tactics were slightly different during his once - a - week team assessment			0
" i kept having a look at the guys below me and tried to keep a similar sort of team so they could n't catch me			0
" creator of the @entity5 game , @entity111 of @entity112 , said he had never done well in the game , but it appeared those that won followed the game very closely			1
" you tend to see the same players up there year after year			2
they would follow the fixtures closely and know all of the players			2
@entity111 , despite being the brains behind the game , says he does n't have any answers to the question of how to play world - beating fantasy football			1
" i do n't know if i have any secrets , though , because if i knew them i 'd be a lot better at the game , " @entity111 said .			0
