-- some of my greatest travel memories are about exploring the local markets -- digging through the goods , chatting with vendors , feeling my way through the nuances of a spirited negotiation			1
each time , i walk away with an earful of native lore and insider info -- on top of armfuls of awesome finds			2
the @entity15 and @entity16 in @entity17 takes place one weekend each month , excluding february and july			1
once , i picked up a pair of swingy silver earrings at a market in @entity22 and simultaneously bagged a tip for the best spot to dance to candombe music , something the seller insisted i do while wearing my new purchase			1
it was just the kind of authentic encounter i 'd never have found in a shop on the main drag			2
each of these @entity35 markets will leave you with that same richness of experience -- as well as heaps of quality souvenirs			2
who needs another plastic snow globe , anyway ? @entity43 where & when : @entity44 , @entity45 ; six consecutive days each in mid-may , july and september			1
what : a local auctioneer , @entity48 , started this outdoor market , now the country 's largest , on a somewhat humbler stage back in 1959 : his own backyard			1
now , more than 1 million visitors flood in every year to shop the peerless selection of affordable @entity56 collectibles ( weather vanes , decoys and @entity60 baskets ) and maritime accoutrements ( brass lamps and ships ' wheels ) spread across more than 20 " fields " on either side of the town 's main road , each containing hundreds of vendors			2
@entity0 : 20 great flea markets around the world three of the best fields are @entity75 , known for its quality rustic furniture ; @entity77 , favored for hobnail glassware and intact grain sacks ; and @entity80 , flush with high - end items like colonial cherrywood chests and convex mirrors			1
even the food has a regional bent : try the generously sized $ 10 lobster rolls , the fresh - popped kettle corn , and the @entity88 , a supersoft roll layered with roasted turkey , stuffing , cranberry sauce , and mayo			2
best shot at a bargain : the slower july and september markets may yield better deals than the crowded may outing , which serves as the region 's antiquing - season opener			1
@entity101 's find : a portable radio			2
" i love how [ it ] is part gadget , part accessory : it swings closed into a ring shape you can carry around like a purse as it plays			0
i got it years ago at @entity44 for $ 15			1
" @entity0 gallery : see these cool flea markets @entity113 & @entity16 where & when : @entity15 , @entity17 ; one weekend each month , excluding february and july			1
what : over the course of its quarter - century run , this busy market held on a county fairground has won a reputation as the heartland 's go - to source for all things folky and primitive , such as old metal pails , @entity125 boxes , cross-stitched samplers , and calico quilts			1
farmhouse antiques , like blanket chests , milk - paint cupboards , and sturdy rocking chairs also figure prominently , as do well - preserved dishware and tabletop items			0
@entity0 : how to shop every market like a pro during each year 's three supersize extravaganzas -- in may , june , and september -- the number of vendors swells to more than 2,500 , some operating out of cattle barns and poultry houses			1
visit the market 's online discussion forum to connect with sellers , preview goods , and even post wish lists			1
best shot at a bargain : go in september , when dealers are trying to liquidate their stock for the winter			1
@entity152 where & when : @entity153 , @entity154 ; saturdays from mid-april through @entity155			1
what : in less than two years , this sale in a @entity153 schoolyard has attracted a large enough following to justify a second location and seasonal spin - off events			0
shoppers come for the mix of vintage clothing and jewelry , architectural salvage , and decorative objects like modernist table lamps and metal desk fans dating from the early to mid- 1900s			0
alongside the secondhand - goods sellers , you 'll find booths from local designers of reclaimed - wood furniture , handmade shoes , and more			1
the food stands are just as diverse : celebrated taco vendors , cheesemongers , and bakers all make weekly appearances			0
best shot at a bargain : many of the antiques vendors are willing to cut deals on their merchandise , but the proprietors of new goods tend to keep their prices firm			1
@entity101 's find : " i bought this desk calendar for $ 30 at the @entity152 from one of my favorite sellers , @entity193 ; the owners come up from @entity195 every couple of months to sell			1
their stuff is the best sort of a happy - industrial meets old - school - classroom vibe			0
" the @entity201 where & when : @entity202 , @entity203 ; first sunday of each month			1
what : the @entity206 skyline and the hills of @entity208 serve as a cinematic backdrop for this 800 - plus - vendor market on the main runway of a decommissioned naval base on @entity213			2
organizers enforce a 20 - year - minimum age rule for sale items , which guarantees you 'll be shopping for real - deal relics ( like @entity220 travel posters , @entity222 movie memorabilia , and early - 20th - century @entity224 pottery ) , not tables of tube socks and cheap electronics			0
the layout is clear and intuitive , with long , evenly spaced rows arranged in a grid ; thoughtful touches like pushcarts for hauling heavy purchases , a porcelain - repair kiosk , and free parking with a shuttle service add to the appeal			0
there 's even a handy printable map on the market 's web site			2
best shot at a bargain : fewer sellers turn out from january through march , but those who do are often more eager to negotiate			0
@entity101 's find : " i grew up in @entity246 , where learning to play dominoes is a rite of passage			0
i 've been collecting vintage sets from various flea markets over the years , including [ one ] from @entity251			2
" 127 corridor sale where & when : from @entity253 , @entity17 , to @entity254 , @entity255 ; first weekend in august			0
what : for sheer variety , nothing tops the @entity259 , a bargain - hunter 's paradise that meanders along 654 miles of scenic rural highway			0
seasoned dealers in formal tents as well as locals unloading the contents of their attics set up shop roadside , hawking crocheted table linens , boxes of fishing lures , weathered iron bed frames , and garden statuary			0
there is n't one stretch of road that 's consistently the best , so let regional attractions narrow your focus : in @entity280 alone , you can stay the night in a tepee or a log cabin and make a pit stop to pick wild blueberries at @entity285			0
best shot at a bargain : at a sale this vast , it 's simply all about persistence			0
