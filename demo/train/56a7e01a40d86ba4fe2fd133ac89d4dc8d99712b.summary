@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 's governor on tuesday named a former head of the federal @entity5 to lead a state investigation into last week 's coal mine explosion that left 29 miners dead			1
@entity9 has overseen investigations into two previous mine accidents , the @entity13 disaster that killed 12 miners in 2006 and the fire at the @entity17 no. 2 mine that left two workers dead			1
the @entity1 native served as the @entity22 administration 's assistant labor secretary for mine safety in the 1990s and is vice president of @entity25			1
" @entity9 has the experience and knowledge to lead what will be a complex and extensive investigation into this horrible accident , " gov. @entity26 said in announcing @entity9 's appointment			1
" we made tremendous progress in 2006 immediately following the @entity13 and @entity36 accidents , and i fully expect that we will learn even more from this and make dramatic changes to protect our miners			2
" the last bodies were recovered early tuesday from the @entity42 mine , the scene of the fatal explosion april 5			2
@entity9 was critical of the mine 's owner , @entity1 - based @entity47 , in the days after the blast			1
" some companies , and this appears to be one , take the approach that these violations are simply a cost of doing business -- it 's cheaper for us to mine in an unsafe way or in a way that risks people 's lives than it is for us to comply with the statutes , comply with the laws , " @entity9 said last week			1
there was no immediate response from @entity47 to @entity9 's appointment , but @entity47 ceo @entity66 said last week that its safety history is among the best in the industry			1
the @entity71 , @entity1 , mine received 458 citations from federal inspectors in 2009 , and more than 50 of those were for problems that the operators knew about but had not corrected , according to federal mine safety records			1
inspectors cited the operators more than 100 times in the first quarter of 2010 , including six times for " unwarrantable failure " to correct violations			0
@entity47 subsidiary @entity84 pleaded guilty to 10 criminal charges and paid a record $ 4.2 million in fines and civil penalties in connection with the january 2006 fire that @entity9 investigated			1
@entity26 said the state owes an explanation for last week 's disaster to the families of the men who died in the @entity42 mine , " and we owe it to them and every coal miner working today to do everything humanly possible to prevent this from happening again			1
" managers of two pension funds have called on @entity47 's board to oust @entity66 , who has been critical of mining regulations in the past			2
" @entity47 's cavalier attitude toward risk and callous disregard for the safety of its employees has exacted a horrible cost on dozens of hard - working miners and their loved ones , " @entity107 state comptroller @entity106 said in a written statement monday			2
he said @entity66 " must step down and make room for more responsible leadership at @entity47			0
" @entity107 's state pension fund , which @entity106 manages , has about $ 14 million worth of @entity47 stock -- a tiny fraction of the company 's estimated $ 4.3 billion market capitalization			0
but his call was echoed by the @entity126 , which manages pension funds for about 6 million union workers			0
@entity126 blamed @entity66 's " confrontational approach to regulatory compliance " and the failure of the company 's board of directors to challenge him for the disaster			0
" under chairman and ceo @entity66 's domineering leadership , @entity47 placed short - term production and profit goals ahead of prudent risk management , with devastating consequences for the corporation , its shareholders and employees , " the fund wrote in a letter to the board			0
" in light of these consequences , the urgent need for new leadership is apparent			0
" the company has not commented on calls for @entity154 's ouster , but said safety " has been and will continue to be our top priority every day			0
" " we do not condone any violation of @entity5 regulations , and we strive to be in compliance with all regulations at all times , " it said in a written statement last week			0
bodies of the remaining victims were removed overnight , said @entity166 , spokeswoman for the @entity167 of @entity168			0
the bodies of seven victims had been recovered shortly after the explosion , and 13 bodies were removed sunday			0
until sunday , @entity173 flags on all federal buildings in the state will be kept at half - staff per a proclamation that president @entity178 signed on monday			2
the mining disaster was the worst in the @entity173 since 1972 , when 91 miners died in a fire at the @entity182 in @entity183 , @entity184			1
@entity2 's @entity185 contributed to this report .			0
