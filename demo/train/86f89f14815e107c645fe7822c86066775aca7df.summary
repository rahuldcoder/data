-- when talking about so - called family values , pastors , popes , and politicians routinely quote the @entity5 as if it were an unassailable divine authority -- after all , they assume , @entity6 wrote the @entity5 , and therefore it is absolutely and literally true			1
but that is a misconception			0
as the @entity5 itself makes clear , its authors were human beings , many of whom are named : @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 , and @entity19			2
these human writers wrote over the course of more than a thousand years , and their writings reflect their own views and the values they shared with their contemporaries			2
so it 's not surprising that inconsistencies are frequent in the @entity5 , both trivial and profound			1
although @entity30 and @entity31 , individually and collectively , have for the last 2,000 years accepted the @entity5 as authoritative in principle , in practice many of its values have been rejected			1
on issues such as slavery , no one today would maintain that slavery is acceptable , even though , according to the @entity5 , it was a divinely sanctioned institution			1
in the debates about slavery in the 19th century those opposed to its abolition cited the @entity5 in support of their position , but despite such biblical warrant , their views were renounced			2
according to biblical law , a father could sell his daughter as a slave , and the last of the @entity54 lists as off - limits a neighbor 's possessions -- his house , wife , slaves , and livestock			0
but the majority of modern @entity30 and @entity31 no longer accept the biblical view of women as men 's property and hence subordinate to them , as they have also abandoned the biblical practice of polygamy			1
in current debates about family values , most of which have to do with sex , opponents of abortion and advocates of a woman 's right to choose both cite the @entity5 in support of their conflicting views , even though the @entity5 in fact says nothing specifically about the issue			1
and with regard to same - sex marriage , although the few biblical writers who mention same - sex relationships , especially between men , were unequivocally opposed to them , many contemporary believers would argue that , as with slavery and the status of women , it is time to recognize that the values of the biblical writers are no longer necessarily our own			1
opponents of same - sex marriage cite @entity98 , which says that when a man sleeps with a man as with a woman it is an abomination			0
they 're right : it does say that			0
but it later calls for the death penalty for such activity , which only the most rabid opponents would insist on			0
the @entity5 also calls eating pork and a woman wearing a man 's clothes abominations , yet many would no longer enforce such prohibitions			1
individual biblical texts should not be appealed to selectively : such cherry - picking is all too easy because of the nature of the @entity5 as a multi-authored book			2
rather , as with another formative text , the @entity119 , one needs first to understand it historically -- what did its words mean when they were written -- and then attempt to determine what its underlying values are , not just what it says in a specific passage			0
only in this sense can the @entity5 be considered to have timeless relevance that transcends the historical particularities of its authors			2
what are those underlying values ? i would argue that they are rooted in love of neighbor , which @entity30 and @entity31 commentators over the ages have identified as the essential and enduring message of the @entity5			1
here are three of them			0
the great rabbi @entity145 , who when asked what the basic principle of the @entity147 was , replied : " what is hateful to you do not do to your neighbor : that is the whole @entity147 ; the rest is commentary			0
" his words are echoed both by his near - contemporary , another rabbi , @entity159 , who put it this way : " whatever you wish people to do to you , so you should do to them : for this is the law and the prophets , " and by an early leader in the movement that @entity159 started , the rabbinically trained @entity19 , who pronounced that " love is the fulfilling of the law			0
" so , i suggest , the essence of the @entity5 -- its ultimate authority -- is not in its individual pronouncements , but in its underlying message : equal , even loving , treatment of all persons , regardless of their age , gender , socio - economic status , ethnicity , or sexual orientation			1
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity183 .			0

@entity183 : bible seen as unassailable divine authority , but it was written by men , not @entity6
written over course of *1,000* years , each writer reflecting values of his day , he writes
much in @entity5 rejected : slavery , women as property , pork as abomination , @entity183 says
@entity183 : @entity5 's true timeless message is equal , even loving , treatment of all people
