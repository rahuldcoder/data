@entity0 made history tuesday after qualifying for the @entity2 for the first time in the nation 's history			1
@entity7 's strike gave his country a 1 - 0 win over @entity10 in @entity11 to ensure his team will compete at next year 's tournament in @entity14			1
it was in 1995 that @entity0 played its first match as an independent nation following the break up of @entity19			1
twice it has come close to reaching major tournaments , losing out to @entity22 on both occasions in the @entity24 and 2012 @entity26 playoffs			1
" i congratulate these guys for their great work in the last four years , and it would have been real injustice if we had failed to win the group and qualify for the @entity2 , " coach @entity27 told @entity0 media			1
the victory sparked wild scenes of jubilation in @entity37 where fans celebrated with fireworks and chanting following the result			2
@entity43 striker @entity42 said : " i wish to send my regards to @entity14 and say that we will show how mighty @entity0 is			1
" elsewhere , @entity46 booked its place in @entity14 with an impressive 2 - 0 victory over @entity49 at @entity50			1
@entity51 and @entity52 were both on target in an entertaining affair			0
it means @entity56 will have to negotiate the playoffs with @entity46 able to relax -- much to the relief of manager @entity59			1
" i 'm greatly satisfied , " @entity59 told @entity60			0
" it was a tough group , both @entity61 and @entity49 showed themselves to be great opponents both home and away			1
" we played some sensational football in the first half and we dug in very well and controlled them in the second			0
" we always said that if we could get to the last two games , we 'd be stronger and have players coming back			0
" we 've found a winger in @entity73 who looks as though he 's been playing there ( international football ) all his life			2
he 's going to be under a lot of pressure now but he 's a level headed young man and he 'll deal with it			2
" we 've been working together for 18 months and the way we play has changed			0
we 're getting better all the time and hopefully will get better still			2
the players really are a group and they trust each other			0
" @entity88 midfielder @entity87 was given a place in the starting line up in place of @entity92 and played a key role in his side 's success			2
" we did everything we wanted to in the first half			0
second half , they came out and created chances straight away , " he told the @entity99			0
" we stayed strong and saw it through			0
at 1 - 0 , sometimes you get caught in between getting another goal and holding on			0
" we set out to qualify , we are not getting over-excited			2
it is what we expected of ourselves , hopefully it is the shape of things to come			0
" we have set standards , and at times we have not lived up to them			0
we are unbeaten throughout the campaign			0
" the @entity2 is still a long way off , with a lot of football to be played			1
the competition in midfield is tough			0
" @entity118 topped @entity119 i following a 2 - 0 win over @entity122 thanks to goals from @entity124 and @entity125			1
that result means @entity127 must now enter the playoffs despite its 3 - 0 win over @entity130			1
@entity127 will not be seeded for the playoffs and could face @entity56 , @entity131 , @entity132 or @entity22			1
@entity133 will also be in the mix after taking second place in @entity136 @entity133 saw off @entity137 2 - 0 and benefited from @entity139 's home defeat by a @entity141 side which had already qualified			1
meanwhile , @entity142 booked its place in the playoffs following a 1 - 1 draw in @entity146			2
@entity147 gave the visiting side the lead and although @entity146 did equalize , it could not prevent @entity142 from finishing second in @entity150 only @entity151 could have prevented @entity142 from finishing second but it succumbed to a 1 - 0 defeat in @entity154			2
@entity155 qualified following a 1 - 1 draw in @entity157 meaning that @entity22 's 3 - 0 win over @entity159 was superfluous			1
in the night 's other games , @entity132 was beaten 2 - 0 in @entity162 , @entity160 was held to a 1 - 1 draw by @entity164 and @entity165 edged out @entity166 5 - 3 in a thrilling contest			0
in @entity169 , @entity168 took a giant stride towards the @entity2 following a crushing 6 - 1 win over @entity172 in the first leg of its playoff tie			1
@entity175 scored twice , while further strikes from @entity177 , @entity178 , @entity179 and an own - goal sealed the win .			0

@entity0 reaches @entity2 finals for first time in country 's history
@entity46 makes it through following home victory over @entity49
@entity118 and @entity155 seal places at next year 's tournament
@entity127 , @entity22 , @entity142 all qualify for playoff stage
