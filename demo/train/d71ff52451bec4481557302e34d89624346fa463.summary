new devices intended to prevent children from dying of heat stroke in parked vehicles are unreliable , and should not be used as stand - alone measures to prevent such tragedies , the federal government warned monday			1
the devices , which sense the presence of a child in a car after the adult walks away , were determined to be " inconsistent and unreliable " and could give parents a false sense of security , @entity8 chief @entity7 said			1
" @entity18 well - intentioned , we can not recommend parents and caregivers rely on technology to prevent these events from occurring , " @entity7 said			0
the warning is the latest concerning a phenomenon that has befuddled safety experts and terrified parents : the unintentional abandonment of children in cars			2
in many cases , parents or caregivers -- stressed by heavy workloads or distracted by minor changes in their normal routine -- absent - mindedly leave children in cars , only to later discover them dead or suffering from hyperthermia			1
indeed , heat stroke is the leading cause of non-crash vehicle deaths for children under the age of 14 , the safety agency said			1
a total of 527 children have died of heat stroke in cars since 1998 , an average of 38 children a year , it said			1
in about 51 % of the cases , a parent or caregiver forgot about the child			2
in another 17 % , an adult intentionally left a child in the vehicle , apparently unaware that heat can quickly rise to deadly levels even on mildly warm days			1
and in 30 % of the cases , the child entered an unlocked , unattended vehicle			1
the tragedies have prompted a number of manufacturers to develop products to remind parents to check their cars			0
though some devices offer simple reminders to check on children , the safety agency 's study , conducted by the @entity69 , focused on devices that sense the presence of a child in a safety seat or restraint and alert the caregiver if he or she walks away from the car			1
" we evaluated whether the device notified the caregiver as they walked away from the vehicle , and we measured the distance at which the alarm sounded , " said @entity81 , the study 's author			2
" the results showed that none of these three devices ... were completely reliable and consistent in their function and ability to detect children			1
" researchers noted numerous problems with the devices , saying some require the adults to adjust the position of the child within the restraint , some ca n't function in the presence of liquids , and some are hampered by cell phone interference			1
@entity81 commended manufacturers for attempting to address the safety issues , and said they are working to refine their technologies			0
the government stopped short of advising parents not to use the devices , saying they could be used as part of a " layered " approach to protecting a child			2
instead , the safety agency advises that drivers should make a habit of looking in vehicles -- front and back -- before locking the doors and walking away			2
they should also place a @entity124 or note on the front seat as a reminder that a child is in the car , or place a cell phone , purse or briefcase in the back seat to ensure no child is accidentally left in the vehicle			1
they also suggest asking child care providers to call if a child does not show up for care as expected			2
importantly , none of the aftermarket devices protect against a child entering an unlocked vehicle			1
the @entity8 said parents should teach children a vehicle is not a play area , and should store keys out of the reach of children			1
agency officials said heat stroke tragedies have befallen people of all education levels and all walks of life			1
during an agency conference call with reporters monday , @entity156 , a supervisor for a telecommunications company , described losing his young daughter after unintentionally leaving her in a car in 2010			0
he did n't realize his error until returning to his suv and opening the vehicle to put down his laptop computer			0
" that 's the exact moment i 'll never forget , " @entity156 said			0
" to my horror , i realized @entity168 was still in her car seat			2
it 's the last thing i remember			0
i heard someone screaming ; it was me			0
" @entity156 said he still does n't understand how the incident occurred			0
" i know you must be asking yourself , how did he forget his own child ? and it 's a legitimate question , and it 's one i 've asked myself every day for over two years now			0
" and regardless of the painful hours of soul searching , therapy and prayers my family and i have undergone , it 's a question that remains unanswered : how did i forget my child ? " he added that " experts will tell you that it can happen to anybody			0
they say our busy lifestyles can create enough stress to trigger mental lapses			0
it appears minor changes to daily routines contribute to these mental lapses and the stressed - out brain can bury a thought			0
something as trite as a cup of coffee or as crucial as a baby can go on autopilot			0
" and while all that might be true , i can tell you personally when you 've gone through it , it really does n't help			0
