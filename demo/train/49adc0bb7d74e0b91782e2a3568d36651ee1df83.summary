-- as @entity3 comes into view , the thoughts of billions of @entity2 turn to @entity5 , to a sacred weekend that includes the crucifixion and resurrection of @entity9			1
of course , people regard these events with various degrees of literalness			2
but @entity3 retains its power			1
it is , in fact , the essential @entity18 celebration , as the @entity19 focus hugely on this part of the @entity9 story			1
they describe in slow motion his entry into @entity5 and the final week leading up to the crucifixion on @entity27 , the uncertain stillness of @entity28 , when the world seems to have slipped into total darkness , then the joy of the @entity32 itself , with a sense that boundaries have been broken -- most aggressively , the membrane between life and death			2
questions arise , of course			2
did @entity9 really rise from the dead ? what would that look like ? many @entity2 imagine some literal wakening from the dead and refuse to accept the slightest hint that the @entity32 might be regarded as symbolic without denigrating it			1
indeed , if you read the @entity50 narratives closely , it 's not easy to say what actually happened			1
all four of them skip the actual @entity32			2
that is , we never see @entity9 waken			1
the first inkling of change comes when a few women close to him visit the tomb			0
accounts differ on who turned up at the tomb that morning : @entity62 , a close friend of @entity9 , alone or with @entity62 , his mother , and with @entity63 ( who is either @entity62 's sister or the mother of apostles @entity67 and @entity50 )			1
in @entity50 , @entity62 visits the tomb alone			1
to her amazement , she finds the stone rolled away			0
in panic , she runs to tell @entity71 and another ( unnamed ) disciple , who rush to the tomb and find it empty			0
they appear to think someone has stolen the body			0
meanwhile , @entity62 sits outside the tomb by herself , crying softly			0
after a while , she walks back into the crypt , where she sees two angels in white			0
they speak to her , and then a mysterious figure appears at her side to ask her why she 's crying			2
she thinks he 's the gardener , then she recognizes the voice if not the face when he calls her by name			0
she cries : " @entity91 ! " -- in @entity90 , " teacher			0
" the @entity94 appearances of @entity9 vary wildly			1
for the most part , those who meet him fail to recognize him , as in the story of the @entity99 , where @entity9 appears beside two of his followers			1
they do n't recognize him , which suggests that he has not reappeared in a familiar form			0
even when he joins them for dinner , they do n't know who sits beside them			0
only when he prays over the bread before eating do they recognize him , and he immediately disappears -- poof			0
even his closest disciples do n't know @entity9 when they see him , as in @entity50 , where he appears by the @entity113 to @entity71 , @entity114 , @entity115 and two other disciples			1
it takes quite a while for @entity71 , alone among them , to recognize this mysterious figure on the shore who advises them where to catch the fish			0
a kind of summary of @entity9 ' @entity94 appearances will be found in @entity128 's first letter to the @entity129 ( 15:5 - 8 ) : " he appeared to @entity71 [ @entity71 ] , and then to the twelve			1
then he appeared to over five hundred brothers at one time , most of whom remain alive now , though some have fallen asleep			0
then he showed himself to @entity67 , then to all the apostles			0
finally , he appeared to me			0
" this letter of @entity128 is one of the earliest examples of @entity18 literature , written perhaps 20 years after @entity9 died , and it gives us some sense of what stories people were telling about him			1
the last appearance , alas , hardly counts for much , as it occurs on the @entity145 , where @entity128 hears a voice from the @entity147 , which says : " i am @entity9 whom you persecute			1
" ( acts 9:5 ) when @entity128 opens his eyes , however , he sees nothing			0
these accounts of what happened after @entity3 suggest that a lot of different rumors circulated about the @entity32 , and the four @entity19 reflect these divergent stories			1
and the characteristics of @entity9 ' resurrected body shift a good deal			1
in one case , @entity9 asks @entity114 , the famous doubter , to touch the wound in his side , proving that he 's really there			1
elsewhere , @entity9 passes through locked doors like a ghost -- an unsettling image			2
in @entity168 , he astonishes his disciples by eating " a piece of broiled fish " as well as swallowing honey			0
for the most part , his appearances retain a dreamlike quality , suggesting that @entity9 did n't want anyone to assume that whatever happened to him occurred in ordinary time and space			1
he did not , like @entity180 , simply get up and walk from the burial crypt and resume life on the street			0
this is the @entity32 , not the @entity185			0
but @entity18 thinking is resurrection thinking			2
it 's about rebirth or reawakening in many forms , about spiritual and moral transformation			2
and this is the really good news of @entity3 .			2

@entity195 : @entity3 is @entity2 ' most powerful *day* . people vary on how literal resurrection is
the @entity50 writings about this are *unclear* on what happened . they skip that part , he says
he says in @entity207 accounts @entity9 appears , but he is not recognizable
@entity195 : differing accounts suggest much was rumor . but @entity3 rebirth *message* endures
