-- @entity1 has lived through some intense winter weather in the decade he 's lived in @entity3			0
but this winter -- which offered an encore monday in the form of up to 30 inches of snow -- takes the cake			1
" this is the snowiest , craziest winter i have ever seen in my life , " he told @entity0 on tuesday , after hand - shoveling enough snow to create a 7 - foot pile by the driveway			0
" between brutally cold days of negative 20 with the wind , then two days where the temperature hit 50 and 30 inches of snow in 24 or 48 hours , this is one for the books , " @entity1 said			1
the storm -- the same system that brought tornadoes to @entity25 earlier in the week -- dumped up to 30 inches of snow on parts of @entity3 , @entity28 and @entity29			1
it also brought heavy rain to parts of @entity33 , @entity28 , @entity34 , @entity35 and @entity36 and prompted flood warnings and watches as far south as @entity39 , according to @entity0 meteorologist @entity40			1
in @entity42 , where the @entity43 officially reported 17.1 inches of snow but posted reports of up to 30 inches in places , @entity41 was still cooped up on tuesday , if comfortably , " with plenty of food for a week if need be			1
" " it 's great to see the sun today -- very pretty with all the pine trees hanging low with their thick coating of snow , " he said			0
although many roads were clear , @entity41 and his family were still stuck tuesday because the family snow removal contractor spent much of the day rescuing people from the snow or getting stuck himself , @entity41 said			0
by the time he arrived monday night , he could get only halfway up their driveway before he had to quit			0
the snow comes as an unwelcome coda to winter for @entity3 , where the 43 inches recorded in february set a record for the month , according to the @entity40			2
that being said , heavy march snow is not unheard of in the state -- the record for the month is 47.6 inches , she said			2
while the snow was a nuisance , flooding was the greater threat throughout parts of the @entity74			1
high water from intense rain caused major flooding along the @entity78 and still rivers in @entity33 , as well as minor or moderate flooding along the @entity33 , @entity82 , @entity83 and @entity84 rivers			1
in @entity87 , @entity33 , video from @entity0 affiliate @entity86 showed fast - moving floodwater rising almost to the doorknobs of some homes			2
@entity87 resident @entity91 told the station that the water rose too quickly for him to get anything out of the house			0
" came out of nowhere , " he said			0
" next thing you know i have 3 feet of water and i had no time to do anything but lock up the house , jump in the truck and watch the water accumulate higher and higher			0
" up to 2 1/2 inches of rain are forecast for parts of @entity33 on thursday , raising the threat of additional flooding in the western part of the state , according to the state department of @entity110 and @entity111			1
the storm also could bring a bit more snow to @entity3 .			2

up to 30 inches of snow fall on parts of the @entity74
heavy rain from the same storm causes flooding in @entity33
more rain is forecast later in the week
