-- @entity2 food was the great star of the second state dinner held in the @entity6 administration			1
in honor of president @entity9 , the menu was @entity2 dishes made from iconic @entity12 ingredients with herbs and vegetables that were grown in the @entity16 gardens			1
who would dare surprise a @entity2 president with @entity2 dishes in @entity20 ? the chosen chef was @entity22 , one of the great gurus of @entity2 cuisine in the @entity12 , who has popularized his dishes through his tv program , six cookbooks and , of course , his three restaurants : the casual @entity31 , the four - star @entity32 and the newly opened @entity33			1
his restaurants are in @entity35 , and the @entity36 were regular patrons before the couple moved to @entity20			1
still , the @entity39 - winning chef was surprised to be invited to their new home			0
" i could hardly believe it			0
i kept going back to see if i actually had been invited or if it was a mistake ... no , it is an amazing honor to be invited to cook at the @entity16 , " @entity22 said in an interview with @entity0			1
the evening 's dishes were carefully chosen after consulting with first lady @entity6 and executive @entity16 chef @entity47			1
" we started with menus that we knew that the president and first lady had enjoyed , things that they have enjoyed they were at our restaurants			1
and we put two or three different menus because i did n't know how they did the service at the @entity16 , and you have to make the menu tailored to the way the kitchen is set up			0
you ca n't do all things in all kitchens , " @entity22 explained			2
" we learned that we could n't serve soup because we knew that the first lady really enjoyed the tortilla soup , the soup that we do , but she said it was too hard to serve for 200 because the service is really fast			0
" and finally , what was the menu ? the guests began their dinner with a @entity76 salad with oranges , grapefruit and pineapple citrus vinaigrette served with a @entity80 2007			0
this was followed by an herb green ceviche of @entity84 opah ( fish ) with sesame - cilantro crackers			0
the main dish was @entity89 beef in @entity91 black mole accompanied by black bean tamalon and grilled green beans , paired with a @entity94 2006			0
finally , dessert was chocolate - cajeta tart with toasted homemade marshmallows , graham cracker crumble and goat cheese ice cream accompanied by a @entity101 brut champagne			0
" the whole idea about a state dinner -- and people do n't usually understand this -- but when you are hosting a dignatary from a foreign country it is not common to serve food from their country			0
it is common to serve them the best of @entity12 cuisine , because you are hosting them , " @entity22 said			2
" it 's huge departure for @entity6 administration to have served food of @entity2 , but they did it because of my work , i have really brought the true flavors from @entity2 to the @entity12 ... however , we did feature a number of fabulous @entity12 ingredients like the opah from @entity128 and the @entity129 from @entity130			1
" " i loved it ... it was such a great menu that we are going to put that menu as one of our tasting menus in @entity32 in a couple of weeks " , said @entity22 , who was born in @entity131 but lived in @entity2 from 1980 to 1986			1
of all the praises chef @entity22 received for the dinner , two made him particularly happy			2
one , from @entity2 first lady @entity146 , " who said that she loved the ceviche verde that we did , she told me that two or three times that she loved that ceviche			1
" the other , from president @entity9 , " who said that it was one of the best mole negro he had ever had , " said @entity22			2
the @entity16 blogged about the dinner that mole was precisely the most complicated part of the dinner , not only because it takes more than 20 ingredients and seven hours to make , but also for another reason			0
" i did n't want the flavors of the toasting chiles and things like that to get out of the kitchen and waft the @entity16			0
i thought it was inappropriate to do that			0
@entity165 , the chef there , she ensured me that they had really good exhaust systems and she was right , it took all those aromas out , but i toasted the chiles just a few at a time so the aroma would not leak out of the kitchen , " @entity22 added			2
at the end , the labor was well worth it because , the chef said , " it 's one of the best moles i have ever made			2
" @entity22 is used to working under the spotlight -- he also took top honors on @entity181 's " top chef masters " tv program .			1

@entity22 was chosen to cook @entity2 food for the president of @entity2
the @entity36 were *familiar* with the chef after dining at his @entity35 restaurants
@entity22 : @entity2 's first lady said several times she loved the *cerviche* verde
