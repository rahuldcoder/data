editor 's note : @entity2 is the playwright of " @entity3 " and the founder of @entity5 , a global movement to end violence against women and girls			1
@entity5 has funded over 10,000 community - based anti-violence programs and launched safe houses in the @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17			0
this commentary was adapted from remarks @entity2 made wednesday to the @entity20 on @entity21 and the @entity22 , @entity23			1
playwright @entity2 says conflict in @entity25 is taking a terrible toll on women and girls			1
( @entity28 ) -- i write today on behalf of countless @entity5 activists worldwide , and in solidarity with my many @entity12 sisters and brothers who demand justice and an end to rape and war			1
it is my hope that these words and those of others will break the silence and break open a sea of action to move @entity12 women toward peace , safety and freedom			2
my play , " @entity3 , " opened my eyes to the world inside this world			0
everywhere i traveled with it scores of women lined up to tell me of their rapes , incest , beatings , mutilations			2
it was because of this that over 11 years ago we launched @entity5 , a worldwide movement to end violence against women and girls			1
the movement has spread like wildfire to 130 countries , raising $ 70 million			0
i have visited and revisited the rape mines of the world , from defined war zones like @entity73 , @entity74 and @entity13 to the domestic battlegrounds in colleges and communities throughout @entity78 , @entity79 and the world			1
my in - box -- and heart -- have been jammed with stories every hour of every day for over a decade			0
nothing i have heard or seen compares with what is going on in the @entity12 , where corporate greed , fueled by capitalist consumption , and the rape of women have merged into a single nightmare			1
@entity91 , the systematic and planned destruction of the female population , is being used as a tactic of war to clear villages , pillage mines and destroy the fabric of @entity12 society			2
in 12 years , there have been 6 million dead men and women in @entity25 and 1.4 million people displaced			1
hundreds and thousands of women and girls have been raped and tortured			1
babies as young as 6 months , women as old as 80 , their insides torn apart			2
what i witnessed in @entity25 has shattered and changed me forever			1
i will never be the same			0
none of us should ever be the same			0
i think of @entity112 , shot in her vagina , who now has tubes instead of organs			0
@entity117 , raped by gangs as she was tied upside down to a wheel			0
@entity121 , who is my heart -- an 8 - year - old girl who was held for 2 weeks as groups of grown men raped her over and over			0
now she has a fistula , causing her to urinate and defecate on herself			0
now she lives in humiliation			0
i was in @entity73 during the war in 1994 when it was discovered there were rape camps where white women were being raped			1
within two years there was adequate intervention			0
yet , in @entity25 , femicide has continued for 12 years			1
why ? is it that coltan , the mineral that keeps our cell phones and computers in play , is more important than @entity12 girls ? is it flat - out racism , the world 's utter indifference and disregard for black people and black women in particular ? is it simply that the @entity151 and most governments are run by men who have never known what it feels like to be raped ? what is happening in @entity25 is the most brutal and rampant violence toward women in the world			1
if it continues to go unchecked , if there continues to be complete impunity , it sets a precedent , it expands the boundaries of what is permissible to do to women 's bodies in the name of exploitation and greed everywhere			2
the women in @entity25 are some of the most resilient women in the world			1
they need our protection and support			0
@entity181 governments , like the @entity179 , should fund a training program for female @entity12 police officers			1
they should address our role in plundering minerals and demand that companies trace the routes of these minerals			0
make sure they are making and selling rape - free - products			0
supply funds for women 's medical and psychological care and seed their economic empowerment			2
put pressure on @entity197 , @entity25 , @entity198 and other countries in the @entity201 region to sit down with all the militias involved in this conflict to find a political solution			2
military solutions are no longer an option and will only bring about more rape			0
most of all , we must support the women			0
because women are at the center of this horror , they must be at the center of the solutions and peace negotiations			0
women are the future of @entity25			1
they are its greatest resource			0
sadly , we are not the first to testify about these atrocities in @entity25			2
i stand in a line of many who have described this horror			0
still , in @entity25 , 1,100 women a month are raped , according to the @entity151 ' most recent report			1
what will the @entity179 government , what will all of you reading this , do to stop it ? let @entity25 be the place where we ended femicide , the trend that is madly eviscerating this planet -- from the floggings in @entity238 , the new rape laws in @entity74 , the ongoing rapes in @entity13 , @entity241 , @entity242 , the daily battering , incest , harassing , trafficking , enslaving , genital cutting and honor killing			1
let @entity25 be the place where women were finally cherished and life affirmed , where the humiliation and subjugation ended , where women took their rightful agency over their bodies and land			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			2

@entity2 : war in @entity25 is targeting girls and women
