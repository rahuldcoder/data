-- with rumors piling up about a forthcoming @entity4 tablet , it appears more and more likely that such a device will emerge soon			1
this illustration imagines what an @entity4 tablet device might look like			1
but what 's still unclear is how this gadget will set itself apart from @entity4 's multimedia - savvy product line , including the @entity13 and @entity14 , as well as the scores of failed tablet pcs that have come and gone			1
judging from the company 's past moves , we 're betting that @entity4 's tablet will be a media - centric device , focused -- at least in part -- on shaking up the publishing industry			1
@entity4 is already prepared to blow @entity24 and other e-book makers out of the water with one key weapon : @entity28			1
having served more than 6 billion songs to date , the @entity29 has flipped the music industry on its head			0
it also turned mobile software into a lucrative industry , as proven by the booming success of the @entity13 's @entity36 , which recently surpassed 1.5 billion downloads			0
@entity4 has yet to enter the e-book market , and making books as easy to download as music and @entity13 apps is the logical next step			1
what can @entity4 do better with e-books ? for textbooks or anthologies , @entity4 can give @entity28 users the ability to download individual chapters , priced between a few cents to a few bucks each			1
it would be similar to how you can currently download individual song tracks from an album			1
it might even have the same earthshaking potential to transform an entire industry by refocusing it on the content people actually want instead of the bundles that publishers want them to buy			0
( of course , @entity4 would likely offer the Ã  - la - carte purchase model in addition to the option to purchase the entire book as one download -- a more attractive option for shorter works such as novels			2
) college students would love this : teachers rarely assign an entire textbook , so they would save hundreds of dollars by downloading only a few chapters of each textbook			0
@entity4 is already popular in the education sector , so here 's even more money to milk from students , with the textbook industry worth an estimated $ 9.8 billion			2
sci - fi fans might only want one story from an anthology , or a historical researcher might target certain subjects			0
all @entity4 has to do to secure the book publishers ' enthusiastic cooperation is to offer them a generous cut of the revenues , like the 70 percent it currently offers app developers			0
other than having the upper hand with digital distribution , an @entity4 tablet can compensate for other e-book readers ' shortcomings			1
in a previous story , @entity96 polled students on their interest in @entity24 's large - format @entity101 reader			1
several of them said they could n't imagine ditching textbooks for a @entity101 , foreseeing challenges with tasks such as notetaking , highlighting and switching between books while writing essays			0
assuming its computing powers and interface design are anything like the @entity13 's , a touchscreen tablet would make these student - oriented tasks as easy as a few swipes and taps -- far more pleasant than clunking around with the @entity101 's cheap buttons and sluggish interface			2
plus , we would imagine students would be able to type their papers on the tablet			0
then there 's the obvious : an @entity4 tablet would have color , making it better for displaying magazine pages , which could also be purchased through the @entity29			1
it would n't be saddled with a slow e-ink screen , so it could display video and browse the web with aplomb			0
let 's not forget to mention the multitude of other tasks an @entity4 tablet will likely be able to perform if developers decide to code applications for it			1
think along the lines of an interactive remote control to enhance the movie - viewing experience on your tv , or a music video player to accompany the tunes blasting from your stereo			0
or , heck , even an album - cover display screen for you to gaze at while listening to music			0
( for more on an @entity4 tablet 's advantages versus current e-book readers , see @entity155 's story " @entity101 wo n't @entity156 if @entity157			1
" ) there 's huge potential in a tablet if @entity4 can pull this off			2
the challenge lies in establishing the right partnerships			0
if @entity4 weaves e-books into the @entity29 , will book publishers hop on board ? given @entity4 's success in numbers , we think so			2
as for a data provider , it would be even better if @entity4 could work with a carrier such as @entity173 to subsidize the tablet , bringing it closer to $ 500 -- a more attractive price point for students			2
because the device presumably would not feature a phone , the monthly plans could be priced significantly lower than an @entity13 -- $ 30 to $ 40 , perhaps , for an unlimited 3 - g internet connection			0
