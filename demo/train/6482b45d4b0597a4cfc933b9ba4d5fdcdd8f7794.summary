-- watch out ! lock up your loved ones ! another bloated , over-produced , high - concept monstrosity has escaped from the labs at @entity5 , and it 's out to devour your kids			1
@entity9 , aka " @entity8 , " has to save the world in " @entity8			2
" but do n't be too alarmed			0
" @entity8 " is relatively harmless -- a toothless satire with a knee - jerk feminist theme and a sorry excuse for a plot			1
that sounds harsh , i know			0
who does n't want to see a 50 - foot woman careening through @entity18 on skates that turn out to be automobiles -- the ultimate demolition roller derby ? but think about that , just for a second			1
roller skates work because they have fixed wheels			0
try it with motorcars and you wo n't get very far			0
is that too picky ? perhaps , but you would n't find @entity31 playing so fast and loose with the laws of physics , and that kind of inattention to detail is typical of the lackadaisical storytelling here and in other @entity5 animated features			0
( the talent pool for this one includes the directors of " @entity43 " and " @entity44 " and the writers of " @entity46 " and " @entity47 , " incidentally			0
) high concepts , top - notch voice talent and scattershot pop cultural references are no compensation for a coherent script			1
the @entity54 lady in question -- dubbed " @entity8 " by her @entity57 military guards -- starts out plain and petite @entity58 ( voiced by @entity59 ) , until a meteorite hits her just minutes before she 's supposed to tie the knot with unctuous chauvinist @entity62 ( @entity63 )			1
her rapid growth spurt saves her from that particular fate worse than death , even if at first glance her new roommates do n't look like much of an improvement			0
there 's dr. @entity71 ( @entity72 ) , a mad scientist who semi-advertently mutated with a bug ; @entity8 ( @entity74 ) an amorphous blue jelly - like blob who gets on just fine without a brain ; missing link ( @entity80 ) , a gung - ho amphibian who 's all mouth ; and a giant dust mite called @entity84 who is n't voiced by anyone because he does n't have anything to say			1
sci - fi fans will have fun counting off the references to myriad classics -- " @entity92 , " " invaders from @entity94 , " " @entity95 , " " @entity96 , " " @entity97 , " " @entity98 " and " @entity99 , " for starters -- and noting a few clever bits and pieces ( @entity103 , as general @entity104 , riffs on @entity106 in " @entity107 " )			0
the trouble is , once the introductions are over , the filmmakers can only launch their desperately limp plot : the @entity112 turns to these monstrous superheroes to save the planet from evil @entity8 ( @entity115 ) , a squidlike creature with four eyes and twice as many legs , and a one - eyed tin robot to do his dirty work for him			1
@entity8 gets a kick - butt finale , and is a much stronger character -- in any number of ways -- than the movie 's president			1
( in a genuinely witty casting touch he 's voiced by @entity128			2
) that may be good politics or at least a sound marketing decision from the studio 's perspective -- it 's been awhile since a family animated feature produced a genuinely strong female character ( unless you count " @entity139 , " which was way too scary for my family ) -- but @entity9 's self - esteem is an awfully long time coming			1
ireport.com : what do you think of ' @entity8 ' ? ( @entity146 -- and maybe it 's just my imagination -- @entity8 bears a passing resemblance to president @entity150			1
i wonder ... would that make @entity9 / @entity8 a surrogate for @entity153 or @entity154 ? ) visually , too , " @entity8 " is undistinguished , although its shortcomings may be disguised if you seek out the @entity158 version			2
funny how @entity158 movies tend to produce two - dimensional characters , with " @entity139 " again the exception to the rule			0
jocular and unpretentiously trashy , " @entity8 " should be a lot of fun -- and it is , in places			2
but the truth is it 's as hung up on itself as @entity9 's preening fiance			0
hand on heart , i had a better time at " @entity174			0
" " @entity8 " runs 94 minutes and is rated @entity176 's take , click here .			2

" @entity8 " about @entity181 - born " monsters " taking on *megalomaniacal* alien
