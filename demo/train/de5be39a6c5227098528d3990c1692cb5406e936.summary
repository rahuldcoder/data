@entity0 -- @entity3 @entity2 vented their frustrations with president @entity6 's tax proposal at a closed - door meeting tuesday night , with rank - and - file members slamming the @entity3 for leaving @entity3 @entity2 out of final negotiations , and agreeing too quickly to a @entity11 proposal on the estate tax			1
according to several @entity14 members and aides , much of the discussion centered on the addition of the estate tax exemption to the package extending all the @entity21 - era tax cuts for two years			1
@entity2 are fuming that the administration agreed to exempt inheritances up to $ 5 million and to set the tax rate at 35 %			1
the estate tax is scheduled to be reinstated at a higher rate of 55 % next year , with the exemption up to $ 1 million			0
a bill passed the @entity3 a year ago that set the threshold for the exemption at $ 3.5 million and the tax rate at 45 %			0
@entity33 democrat @entity32 said , " my sense is people are not happy with this , " telling reporters that @entity2 plan to " push back at little " at the @entity3 to try to change the estate tax back to the version that passed the @entity3			1
@entity32 said if the administration agreed to do that , she could support the package , but she could not predict how many other @entity2 would do the same			1
@entity44 @entity43 of @entity45 called the estate tax provision " one of the biggest problems , because that was the one we had the most leverage on			0
" according to a senior @entity3 @entity14 aide , @entity14 rep @entity51 of @entity52 , who represented @entity3 @entity2 in discussions with the administration and @entity55 , said the decision to accept the @entity11 estate tax proposal was " an unnecessary giveaway to @entity60			1
" @entity11 sen. @entity60 of @entity61 , who was negotiating for @entity55 , sponsored an estate tax bill that is essentially the same as the deal outlined by @entity6			2
about 20 @entity3 @entity2 lined up at microphones at the evening meeting to complain about the president 's proposal			1
according to the senior @entity14 aide , in addition to concerns about the substance of the proposal , equally upsetting to attendees was how " @entity2 were left out of the process at the end			2
" the aide added , " they view it as a trend , " noting that it started with the president 's stimulus package			0
" @entity84 always seems to get rolled , " the aide said			0
house speaker @entity86 " did n't really weigh in either way " during the meeting about how members should vote on the president 's plan , according to the aide , " but she certainly was n't cheerleading for it			0
" but @entity86 made it clear @entity2 were unhappy , telling reporters outside the meeting , " i think it 's fair to say that there is a certain amount of unease with the proposal that was put forth by the president			2
" she also noted that the estate tax benefits a much smaller number of families than the middle - class tax cut			2
the senior @entity14 aide conceded that despite the threats to vote against the plan , it 's also a reality that the proposal could still pass the @entity3			2
" this gets done , but does not get done with a majority of @entity14 votes , " the aide said			0
vice president @entity116 is scheduled to talk to @entity3 democrats wednesday afternoon			0
asked whether @entity116 could convince @entity2 to support the plan , @entity3 majority leader @entity118 quipped , " you 'll have to ask him			0
" @entity118 did n't directly answer whether he believed @entity3 @entity2 could make significant changes to the administration 's plan , saying , " i think it 's under discussion , " but he added , " the majority of the @entity3 is still @entity14 "			1
