@entity0 -- few people have had so much impact on the @entity5 attitude towards sexuality and gender equality than @entity8			1
a spritely , sassy cultural icon , @entity8 ( or @entity10 ) has sashayed her way to stardom as dancer - choreographer of @entity14 's @entity13 , one of @entity5 's first non-government modern dance troupes			1
@entity8 has also emerged as one of the most prominent -- and controversial -- emblem of personal freedom and gender equality in @entity5			1
@entity8 was one of the first @entity5 to have a sex change operation -- and the first officially recognized by the @entity5 government			1
@entity8 's story acquires distinct significance in the @entity5 context			1
although the wall of puritanism built around @entity5 's sexual mores has been gradually crumbling , traditional @entity5 reticence and sexual stereotypes persist			1
i first met @entity8 in 1994 , when he was a man			2
he had just returned to @entity0 after spending four years in the @entity34 , learning modern dance from mentors like @entity37 , and later dancing with professional troupes in @entity39 and @entity40			0
that time , the 26 - year - old was perhaps the best male dancer in @entity5 , much admired for his furious pirouettes , soaring leaps and dazzling choreography			1
a year later , @entity8 decided to have sex change			1
" when i was six years old , i thought i should be a woman , " @entity8 said			2
" i myself knew something was wrong , but i did n't know what was wrong or what was mistaken			0
i had a confusing moment			0
i was wondering maybe i am homosexual , but in the end i said , no , i should come back to myself			0
" it was a difficult decision			0
homosexuality was still considered a crime , tagged as " hooliganism , " and was officially listed as a " mental disorder			0
" " that was quite taboo in 1995 , " @entity8 recalled			2
" the country 's best male dancer becomes a female dancer -- that 's too much for the @entity5 society and government			1
" fortunately for @entity8 , the society and government took a laissez - faire tack			1
" we @entity5 always take the attitude , whenever things are not certain , we step back or stay there , to give it some time and space and let things naturally happen and become right			2
i was really challenging the boundaries of the society but i had confidence in myself			0
" @entity8 's mother was not as sanguine			1
she worried the surgery would not go well and feared for her son 's future			0
@entity8 fretted over what his father , a military officer , would say			2
at age 28 , @entity8 underwent three sex - change surgeries			1
his final operation lasted 16 hours			0
@entity8 recalls sitting in the hospital and telling his father : " your son has become your daughter			2
" the @entity94 officer was briefly speechless , but after smoking a cigarette , he told @entity8 : " twenty years ago , i looked at you and wondered , i have a son but he looks like a girl			2
so 28 years later , you 've found yourself			0
" the new woman continued to thrive with even more charm and effervescence			0
i recall seeing @entity8 a few times in " @entity104 , " a bar she opened in @entity0 which briefly became a hub for local artists and expatriates			2
i remember seeing her driving in a green @entity109 , rushing from one meeting to another , dressed in mini-skirts , loud colored blouses and high heels			0
in 2000 , @entity8 's life changed again			1
she became a mother , adopting three @entity5 orphans -- son @entity118 , daughter @entity119 and little boy @entity120			2
soon after , she married a @entity122 man , @entity121			0
" everything is legal , " she enthused in her gravelly voice , referring to her sex change , marriage and adoption			1
" but how does the society accept you and digest the status matters -- that 's up to you to convince them			0
" meantime , even though homosexuality has been decriminalized in 1997 and was dropped from the official list of " mental disorders " in 2001 , @entity5 's @entity134 community continues to struggle against social stigma and legal discrimination			1
because the @entity5 government remains largely silent on the issue of homosexuality , they risk official ban or harassment whenever they meet , organize or provide services within the community			0
there are no applicable laws and regulations governing gay marriage , divorce , child custody , adoption and other related issues			0
@entity134 couples are not recognized as constituting families			0
yet , with an estimated transgender community of around 400,000 the @entity5 government has granted them civil rights under the law , allowing them to change their national @entity162 cards and passports , and legally recognizing their marriages after sex - change			1
" it 's still in the struggle period , but it 's getting better , " @entity8 said			1
she believes @entity5 needs more time			0
" the day i came out as a woman to society , i said , ` okay , i give myself 50 years ' time , i will tell the society who i am '			0
" @entity8 's willingness to reveal -- and revel in -- her sex - change story continues to make waves			1
when she is not dancing and choreographing , she is acting in films and appearing as a judge in @entity5 's versions of " @entity179 " and " @entity180			1
" is she a good role model for the @entity5 youth ? " i do n't want to be a role model , " she replied , flashing a smile as she tossed back her coiffed hair			1
" i just want to be myself			0
next month , i will release a book , in which i said , " i do n't want to change the world , but i also do n't want the world to change me too much			2
' i just want to be myself			0
