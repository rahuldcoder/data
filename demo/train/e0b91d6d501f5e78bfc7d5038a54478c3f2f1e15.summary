@entity0 plays a dangerous game			1
he walks a tightrope every night , and it 's amazing that he does n't fall on a regular basis			2
he tells jokes about race , gender , class and people love him or hate him			2
does everyone get a joke ? no. but of course he does say , in persona , amazingly offensive things sometimes			2
last week things went south , and @entity17 exploded in calls to # @entity19			0
the offense ? a 140 - character long foot - in - the - mouth that came from the @entity17 feed @ @entity24			2
the tweet was a joke that played off of a show segment that mocked an attempt by the owner of the @entity30 to make peace with the @entity33 community without having to change the team 's name			2
" i 'm willing to show the # @entity38 community i care by introducing the @entity39			1
" race , meet satire			2
but it did n't work			2
the controversial tweet , it turns out , was not written by @entity0 himself , or from anyone on his show			1
but it was a @entity49 account that presumably had license from the show 's producers to publicize and magnify @entity0 's voice			1
but instead of repudiating the tweet , @entity0 on monday night made further jokes about how the incident almost silenced " my message of core conservative principles mixed with youth - friendly product placement			1
" following the lead of @entity38 - @entity64 activist @entity62 , some have been demanding that " @entity65 " be canceled			1
these words perpetuate hateful stereotypes and bring up a history of very public repression and personal shame			0
to use them now is to call forth that history			0
and in calling it forth , these words create more racism			0
defenders say he 's a " satirist " in the best swiftian mold			0
he has a license to say such things , for he speaks in the name of truth and justice			0
they 're saying that the tweet was n't from him ( even though they were his words )			1
and they 're saying that these words were perhaps taken out of context			0
@entity0 's responses on monday night were uninspiring			1
the whole show was devoted to it , but it was the cold opening that people will remember : @entity0 imagined a dystopian @entity96 world			1
think hell ... er @entity98 ... freezing over , before prominent @entity100 - @entity64 actor @entity99 saves the day by explaining to him that it 's all been a bad dream ! this is still " @entity65			0
" # @entity19 has failed			0
i was n't disappointed because i think the show should be canceled			2
but i was hoping for something more sincere , perhaps even an apology or a sit - down with ms. park to let her issues be aired			0
( on the show , he made no mention of whether he tried to invite her to appear )			0
instead , he invited @entity17 co-founder @entity116 for a mock apology to @entity0 himself , and -- offering a tepid " i never want this to happen again " -- shut down the @entity17 account , @ colbertreport			1
many of @entity0 's defenders have been asking why @entity62 and her followers should get to decide what @entity0 can and can not say ? who cares what they think ? @entity0 should care what they think			1
@entity130 and her followers represent a point of view that @entity0 takes himself to be speaking for , liberals , racial minorities , the underprivileged			1
as a privileged white male , @entity0 ( just like the character he plays ) gets his license to use what would otherwise be outrageous language because of his associations to those communities themselves			1
@entity0 , his defenders will say , is a liberal with a history of fighting for the underprivileged			1
but white satirization of racial politics is conditioned on the blessing of the underprivileged themselves			0
this is why @entity0 , in persona , sometimes cites the existence of a " black friend " and why @entity154 regularly discusses issues of race with his " senior black correspondent			1
" they know that it is precisely the underprivileged themselves that get to determine what should be done with the words that have been used to repress and embarrass them			0
@entity0 , out of persona , should know that			1
without an apology , what we have here is a case of a white liberal comedian trying to have his cake and eat it too			0
he 's saying : " i have license to say hateful things because everyone knows i do n't mean them or because i have an @entity38 friend			1
" but the way he should show he does n't mean them is by being sensitive to how his saying them affects others			0
if @entity62 and the broader community are offended , he ca n't hide behind his liberalism			0
liberalism is a license that comes with responsibilities that @entity0 ought to abide by			2
" @entity65 " was never in any danger of being canceled over this			0
but whether or not he ever recognizes it , @entity0 owes @entity62 , as well as the broader @entity38 community , an apology			1
at the very least he should consider dropping the @entity193 character .			0

a controversial tweet from @ colbertreport raised a *firestorm* over racial satire
@entity200 : though @entity0 did n't post it , he should apologize
he says the tweet , taken from a line he spoke , is offensive for @entity38
@entity200 : just because he is a comedian does n't mean he can tell offensive jokes
