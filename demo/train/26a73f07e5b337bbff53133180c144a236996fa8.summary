-- @entity1 was getting off the bus when the suspects exited the @entity5 , @entity6 , bank with their hostages			1
police had already arrived at the @entity9 , the witness told @entity0 affiliate @entity11 on wednesday , but authorities could n't take out the assailants , not with their guns trained on a customer and two bank employees			1
" there was three guys , had three guns and three hostages , and they had the guns to the hostages ' heads , " @entity1 told the @entity18 station			2
they were just so scared			2
" climbing into a @entity30 belonging to one of the hostages , the robbery suspects made one of the hostages drive			1
police " surrounded the car , and they just could n't shoot at them because they were so close to the hostages			1
they just drove right out of the parking lot , " @entity1 said			0
the security guard who called the police had been tied up inside the bank amid frightened patrons and tellers , authorities said			2
as the suspects fled , a 12 - year - old was left stranded in the parking lot after her mother , who had gone inside to withdraw money , became one of the three hostages			2
the girl texted her father saying , " they took mom , " a man who identified himself as @entity56 , one of the woman 's cousins , told a local television station			0
for the next hour , police would chase the suv on surface streets and interstates through @entity68 to @entity69 , then 20 miles back to @entity5			1
gunfire from a semiautomatic " @entity73 - type assault rifle " and other weapons struck 14 of the 50 or so squad cars that gave chase , police said			1
several police cars and an assault vehicle were disabled in the chase and gunfight , police said			1
what concerned @entity5 police chief @entity83 most was the perpetrators ' recklessness and wanton violence , he said			1
two female hostages either jumped or were thrown from the vehicle -- one shot , one grazed -- and the third victim , the mother , was killed			0
it was n't clear whether police or the robbers killed her , but one suspect acknowledged using her as a human shield , @entity83 said			2
the other two hostages are expected to survive , he said			0
asked why police opened fire on the men when they held a woman hostage , police spokesman @entity100 told reporters , " there was a fear for safety , not only for our officers , but also for the community			1
" @entity83 added during a thursday news conference that it was " frankly amazing " no officers were hit , though some had close calls			0
more than 20 officers were on paid leave as of thursday per department policy following a shooting , he said			0
the suspects , who were gang members or associates , were armed to the teeth , the chief said , and appeared to be out for blood			1
" the suspects had mass amounts of ammunition , either taped to or strapped to their bodies			2
the gunfire on our officers was relentless , " he said			0
they not only hit homes and cars on busy streets with their bullets , but they also lost police at one point and used the opportunity to attack rather than escape , @entity83 said			1
rather than pressing the pedal to the floor , putting distance between them and the dozens of officers tracking them , they stopped to set up an ambush , he said			1
" they briefly lost officers and then stopped off of the roadway off - ramp and turned and had their weapons aimed at the officers who were soon to make the turn looking for them , " he said			0
fortunately , a police commander in an unmarked car saw them setting up their trap and fired on a gunman leaning over the back of the suv , sparking another pursuit , @entity83 said			2
" that officer likely thwarted a deadly ambush , " he said			2
some saw one of the hostages lying on the ground			0
others saw officers in hot pursuit through @entity6 streets and highways			0
many heard the deadly gunbattle that brought the chase to its end			1
" it sounded like firecrackers at first , " one witness told @entity0 affiliate @entity180			0
another told the station , " i could see the car getting blasted			0
i could see all the little sparks and everything off the car			0
" amateur video obtained by @entity0 affiliate @entity11 shows the final moments			0
it sounds as if someone set off a long string of firecrackers as puffs of smoke rise from the blue @entity30 facing off with police cars			1
then the gunfire stops , and the only sound on the video is the wail of police sirens			2
" it sounded like five minutes of straight gunfire , " @entity203 told @entity180			0
" it seemed like it was n't real			0
" one of the suspects had been killed , police said			1
another was injured and would die later at a local hospital			0
neither has been identified , but one was 27 , the other 30 , police said			2
they were both documented members of the @entity216 os street gang , and the 27 - year - old , the primary shooter , had an arrest record , @entity83 said			1
the @entity216 os are a problem in @entity5 , he said			1
the surviving suspect , @entity222 , 19 , of @entity5 was wrapped in a yellow blanket and escorted to a police car , where he was taken to @entity225 and booked on felony charges of murder , kidnapping , robbery and attempted homicide of police officers			1
he is expected to make a court appearance monday			0
@entity222 is an associate of known gang members , and he revealed to police that he was uninjured in the gunfire exchange because he used the last remaining hostage as a shield , the chief said			1
police recovered four guns at the scene , @entity83 said : the assault rifle , a .45 - caliber @entity243 , a .45 - caliber @entity244 and a 9 - mm @entity244			2
many questions remain , namely whether police or the suspects killed the woman found inside the assailants ' suv , but @entity83 told the media it could take " some time " to answer that particular question			1
his officers , along with state and federal authorities , were investigating every angle , he assured reporters			0
no matter what they learn , @entity83 said , one thing is certain : authorities did not want the situation to end the way it did			0
" they put our entire community and nearby communities at risk for a very long time , " he said			0
" we obviously hoped for a peaceful resolution , but these assailants wanted no part of a peaceful resolution			0
