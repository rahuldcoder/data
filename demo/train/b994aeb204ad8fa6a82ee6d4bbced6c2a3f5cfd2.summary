generally , the higher up on the spine an injury occurs , the more the nervous system is affected			0
@entity9 's injury occurred in the middle of the neck			1
doctors said monday that with many spinal cord injuries , the first 72 hours after surgery give a good indication of how much function a patient may recover			1
" @entity9 is in good spirits , and we are praying for a full recovery , " @entity9 's family said in statement			1
the @entity48 ' head football coach , @entity47 , affirmed the family 's optimism			2

ten years ago , @entity58 made a tackle in a game against @entity62 that would alter the course of his life			0
" unfortunately , i had my head down a little bit , " @entity58 said , recalling the hit that shattered his @entity67 vertebrate -- slightly lower on the spinal cord than @entity9 's injury			1
" i went to roll over to get up , and nothing happened			0
i said , ' @entity73 , i ca n't move			0
' " after his injury , @entity58 says , he was mentally in shock			0
his family and teammates helped him stay positive , but his doctors were cautious			1

the weeks went by -- no movement			2
until finally , five weeks after his injury , @entity58 wiggled a toe			0
" when i got that movement , that 's when i really started to believe that i was going to walk again , " he said			2

immediately after the collision , @entity9 is seen on his back with his legs sticking straight out at a 45 - degree angle , unmoving except for a shake of his head			1
