-- the 161 passengers aboard @entity2 must have known something was wrong when a crew member announced on the cabin loudspeaker if anyone aboard was a physician			1
the pilot , capt. @entity7 , 63 , was suffering a heart attack			1
the in - flight emergency thursday night that began somewhere in the skies between @entity11 and @entity12 prompted the 737 to divert to @entity13 , @entity14			1
air traffic controllers radioed the plane 's first officer who updated them with the captain 's condition			0
" we got a man down , chest compressions going on right now , " the first officer said			1
" i 'm not sure too much right now on status			0
" once the aircraft was on the ground , first responders boarded and rushed @entity29 to @entity13 's @entity31 hospital , where he later died			1
the tragedy threatens to reignite the debate over @entity36 age restrictions for commercial airline pilots			1
in 2007 , the mandatory pilot retirement age was raised from 60 to 65			1
at that time the @entity36 said five @entity39 -- their ages ranging from 48 to 57 -- had died in - flight since 1994 , when the @entity36 began following that statistic			2
related story : health vs. experience central to pilot - age debate when the @entity36 was considering raising the retirement age , then - administrator @entity47 underscored the value of pilot experience , calling it " an added margin of safety			1
" " foreign airlines have demonstrated that experienced pilots in good health can fly beyond age 60 without compromising safety , " she said			2
friday , former @entity59 inspector general @entity58 said she does n't believe the @entity2 tragedy alone will fuel a new debate over the issue			1
but she says it does point out the importance of careful pilot health screening			2
" people die everyday from unanticipated heart attacks , but in many cases you can find problems when you do a rigorous physical , " says @entity58 , who 's now at the law firm @entity66 , where she specializes in aviation			2
the @entity36 has already shown signs that it 's looking more closely at other pilot related health issues , including the effects of prescription and over-the - counter medications			0
" i think the @entity36 will probably revisit whether they 're monitoring pilot health stringently enough , " @entity58 says			0
current @entity36 regulations call for a medical examination every year for commercial airline pilots under age 40 and every six months for those over age 40			0
to pass the exam , they must not have an established medical history or diagnosis of coronary heart disease that has required treatment			0
all airline pilots are required to get @entity96 heart checks at the age of 35			2
for those age 40 and older , annual ekgs are required			0
and airline pilots are required to report any heart disease to the @entity36 , regardless of when they learn about it			0
it was n't immediately known whether capt. @entity29 was piloting the plane at the time he became incapacitated			0
typically , there are two pilots in the cockpit so that during an emergency , either pilot can quickly take control of the aircraft			0
@entity2 's passengers waited at the @entity13 airport until @entity2 flew in another pilot from @entity115 , before they were able to continue their journey to @entity12			1
@entity0 's @entity117 and @entity118 contributed to this report .			0
