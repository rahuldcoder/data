-- last august , the @entity1 issued an ultimatum : food manufacturers had one year to make sure any " gluten - free " products met @entity1 requirements			1
to use the " gluten - free " label , products must now have an undetectable level of gluten and can not have any ingredient containing wheat , rye , barley , or any their derivatives			1
if manufacturers continue to use the " gluten - free " label without bringing their food up to scratch , they will be subject to regulatory action from the @entity1			1
( some foods , such as pasta , may still be on shelves legally for a while if they were produced before the ruling			0
) a gluten - free diet is the only medically accepted treatment for those who suffer from celiac disease , although gluten - free is increasingly become a popular diet choice for those who do n't have the condition			2

federal regulations stipulate that the " gluten - free " label means that the product contains fewer than 20 parts per million of gluten			1
this measure is the lowest amount scientists can consistently detect in a food			0
a product labeled " gluten - free " also ca n't contain any of the following : â € ¢ an ingredient that is any type of wheat , rye , barley or a crossbreed of these grains			1
â € ¢ an ingredient derived from these grains that has not been processed to remove gluten			2
â € ¢ an ingredient derived from these grains that has been processed to remove gluten if it results in the food still containing 20 or more parts per million of gluten			0
the ruling applies to packaged foods only			0
@entity1 suggests that consumers remain inquisitive and ask questions about their food in restaurants and other establishments			0
