-- two men were found guilty in @entity3 courts this week for , among other offenses , messages they posted on @entity6			1
on monday , one @entity3 man was sentenced to 10 years in prison for using @entity6 to encourage protests and undermine the country 's leadership , according to @entity3 state news agency @entity12			1
" the accused had sent invitations via @entity6 to participate in protests and gatherings against the @entity20 , " read @entity12 's statement , quoting @entity15 spokesman @entity14			2
@entity14 added how the unnamed man , already serving a three - year jail sentence , was convicted of utilizing websites that are " hostile to the government and that promote deviant ideologies			2
" @entity3 officials often use the phrase " deviant ideologies " when describing @entity30 or @entity30 - linked groups			0
on sunday , another man , accused of insulting @entity33 and inciting protests via social media sites like @entity6 , was sentenced to eight years in jail			1
according to @entity12 , he 's also barred from travel and from posting messages on social media sites for eight years after his release			1
the man , also unidentified by @entity12 , was found guilty of " inciting relatives of @entity3 arrested for security reasons to protest their imprisonment by tweeting and via posting videos on sites like @entity47			1
" @entity14 added the man had been arrested once before for similar offenses , but was released after signing a pledge never to do so again			0
both sentences come just days after @entity3 officially declared the @entity52 to be a terrorist organization			0
on friday , the country 's @entity53 announced that the @entity52 , as well as the @entity57 ( @entity57 ) , @entity55 and other groups had been formally designated terrorist organizations			0
@entity59 detained in @entity60 over parody video speaks out the statement also detailed the country 's new , comprehensive anti-terror legislation , warning any @entity3 or foreigner residing in @entity3 they could be sentenced to heavy jail terms for joining extremist groups or fighting alongside them			1
many , however , maintain the new laws are a barely disguised effort to quash dissent , pointing to the fact that friday 's @entity53 statement also criminalized atheism , more specifically , any @entity3 or resident of @entity3 " propagating atheist ideologies by any means , or questioning the principles of @entity57 faith			1
" " it 's unfortunate that the statement comingles the ( @entity3 ) government 's ongoing intent to severely limit freedoms of expression and religion with its efforts to counter extremism and terrorism , " said @entity80 , deputy director for policy and research with the @entity83			1
" it reinforces longstanding concerns that the @entity3 will spare no expense to crush dissent , " @entity80 told @entity0 , " and punish non-conforming views , even if the views are protected by internationally - recognized human rights			2
" @entity80 called the move to criminalize atheism " very troubling , " adding it was " consistent with the way the @entity3 masquerade ' insults to religious feelings ' as a way of garnering support for other laws that seek to counter religious extremism and name specific entities as terror groups			0
" @entity3 , which has jailed several prominent reform activists in the past two years , is consistently singled out and criticized for its human rights record			2
in a statement from late february , @entity116 , a @entity3 researcher for @entity117 , wrote the new anti-terror legislation has " created a veneer of legality for ongoing human rights abuses by @entity3 criminal justice authorities			0
" " the terrorism law , " added @entity116 , " is a vague , catch - all document that can -- and probably will -- be used to prosecute or jail anyone who criticizes the @entity3 government and to violate their due process rights along the way			0
