-- the effects of @entity2 continued to accumulate this past week with a dramatic vote in the @entity5 @entity4			2
by a bare 12 - vote margin , a bipartisan coalition of more or less centrist @entity7 and @entity8 defeated an equally bipartisan coalition of their more ideological brethren , the latter an incredibly improbable alliance that almost succeeded in defunding @entity15 's telephone metadata program			1
one @entity17 participant described the hours before the vote as " hand to hand combat , " but for now , at least , @entity15 will continue to acquire @entity5 telephone " business records " to help it detect terrorist activity in the @entity5			1
even as @entity5 were focused on the fate of this program , however , lines were being drawn for future debates based on other revelations by data leaker @entity29			2
chief among these is @entity33 , an effort probably best understood by contrasting it to the telephone metadata program			1
@entity33 ( authorized by the @entity37 of 2008 ) is about the content of communications , not just the fact that a communication has taken place			0
it deals with digital data , like e-mails , not traditional phone calls			0
the subjects and activities related to @entity33 collection are foreign and specific , not domestic and broad as in the metadata effort			1
finally , @entity33 is used for a number of legitimate foreign intelligence purposes , not just counterterrorism			2
both programs can only work with the court - compelled compliance of electronic communication service providers			1
and both programs are responsive to the world in which @entity5 found itself after 9/11			0
the metadata program was designed to deal with the reality of potential terrorists already inside the @entity5			1
@entity33 was designed to deal with changes in how modern communications are moved , stored and accessed			0
@entity15 is targeting the communications of a known terrorist in @entity69			2
it discovers that the @entity69 - based terrorist is communicating electronically with another individual ; he could be in @entity72 , elsewhere in @entity69 or even in the @entity5			2
they are using a @entity5 hosted internet service ; they send e-mails back and forth			1
similar contours could apply to e-mail traffic detailing the invoice of a delivery of dual use chemicals to a state suspected of developing chemical weapons			0
or to another communication that provides data on the timing and routing of human trafficking in the @entity89			0
in each of these cases , the only thing likely to be " @entity5 " about any of these communications is that they are physically in the @entity5 and are being hosted by a @entity5 - based internet service , a phenomenon that the 1978 @entity96 , @entity96 , could not have anticipated			1
recognizing this , under the prodding of then - director of national intelligence ( and former director of @entity15 ) @entity101 , @entity97 amended @entity96 in 2008 to allow @entity15 more speedy and effective access to these kinds of communications			1
access is still overseen by the @entity107 ( which also compels firms to turn over requested data ) , but the process no longer requires the time consuming , cumbersome , individualized warrants of the past			0
early @entity29 - based stories here and abroad made a great deal of @entity33			0
rushing against deadline , some outlets reported ( inaccurately ) that @entity15 had direct and free access to the servers of @entity5 internet service providers , or @entity122 , and it was a short step from there to near libelous accusations that the agency was routinely rummaging through the e-mails of ordinary @entity5			1
in reality , in performing its foreign intelligence mission , @entity15 treats @entity33 as just another @entity130 , @entity130 , an admittedly new and particularly valuable collection point , but still one among many designed to acquire foreign communications of foreign intelligence value			1
the alleged @entity15 slides that some have ominously included in their accounts of @entity33 look far more benign to anyone experienced in signals intelligence			2
indeed , if the slides are at all accurate , they look like an orientation briefing designed to show new analysts that @entity33 is one tool in a large tool kit for them to use as they work to piece together actionable intelligence out of diverse , dispersed and frequently hard to acquire foreign communications			0
as recently as this past sunday , however , @entity2 chronicler - supporter - spokesman @entity145 was working to revive the meme of an unchecked @entity15			1
appearing on @entity148 's " @entity147 , " @entity145 described tools that allow analysts " to listen to whatever e-mails they want , whatever telephone calls , browsing histories , @entity156 word documents			0
" @entity145 's accusations were sufficiently broad and breathless ( even though he did at one point concede that there were " legal constraints for how you can spy on @entity5 " ) that the stunningly misleading lead of @entity148 's follow - on story was that these tools " allowed even low - level analysts to search the private e-mails and phone calls of @entity5			0
" actually , if @entity145 's description of the tools themselves is correct , they are the product of a decade - plus effort at @entity15 to improve the analytic and collection means available to its work force , to allow @entity15 analysts at all levels -- analysts trained annually in how to protect @entity5 privacy -- to make a single query to access all relevant information across agency databases and to assign tasking across various @entity185			1
put another way , @entity15 can more readily connect dots ( dots comprised of lawfully collected foreign intelligence ) and coordinate tasking ( of legitimately targeted foreign communications ) than at any other time in the agency 's history			1
and if that is true , it is something we should celebrate rather than condemn			0
but it remains to be seen if the coming national discussion will be based on facts like these or on something else altogether			0
and what of that debate , both overseas and at home ? more to follow			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity207 .			2

supporters of @entity15 metadata program only had 12 - vote margin in favor
@entity215 director *hayden* : prism program is used to target foreign threats
he says agency *employees* are trained to respect privacy
@entity207 : @entity15 does *n't* have access to servers of internet service providers
