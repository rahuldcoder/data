-- after his father was diagnosed with dementia in 1996 , @entity1 faced a difficult decision : he and his wife , @entity5 , either could place his father , @entity6 , in a facility , or they could care for him themselves			1
@entity1 ( right ) and his wife , @entity5 ( left ) , cared for @entity6 at home for eight years			1
unable to afford a care facility , the @entity12 brought him home			1
so began eight long years of caring for the @entity15 veteran and onetime truck driver as he slowly declined -- a burden borne largely by @entity5 , 56			1
she fed him , bathed him and changed his diapers on a daily basis while her husband , a truck driver , was on the road			1
slowly , she says , her marriage began to crumble			2
" i could n't take my frustration out on my father - in - law , " she says			2
instead , she took it out on her husband			2
" we almost ended up divorcing over the whole deal , " says @entity28 , 56			2
@entity5 concedes she considered leaving , " but i could n't walk away from my father - in - law			2
" two years ago , the @entity31 finally threw in the towel			2
a bed became available at a local @entity35 facility , and the elder @entity1 was admitted			2
he remained there until april 2008 , when he died at age 95			2
a difficult labor of love as the @entity12 can attest , the stress of caring for an elderly parent can overwhelm a relationship			1
@entity44 loved ones to appointments , handling their shopping , assuming their financial burden , even just living under the same roof can test even the most committed couples			1
in 2004 , the @entity51 for @entity52 and @entity53 reported that over 44 million @entity54 care for an adult family member or friend			1
almost 80 percent of these are caring for someone older than 50			1
although caring for a parent in their twilight years can be rewarding , it can also be a trial , says @entity63 , the @entity64 - nominated author of " caregiving : the @entity66			1
" " caregiving brings out the best and worst in us all , " she says			2
@entity70 , 39 , a @entity71 , @entity72 , occupational therapist , has experienced that kind of strain in his marriage			2
@entity70 says he has been at odds with his wife since his father was diagnosed with @entity79 's two years ago			2
" i felt like my wife was n't taking this seriously enough , and that if it would have been her parents , it would have been more important , " he says			2
for a while , the @entity84 cared for @entity70 's father at home , but eventually it got to be more than they could handle			0
@entity70 placed his father in a nursing home this past summer			0
but he says the ordeal has continued to strain his marriage			0
" it 's complicated , " he says			0
' your best is good enough ' often , couples will harbor unreasonable expectations of what they can or should do -- together or individually -- to care for an aging parent			1
" you have to accept that your best is good enough , " @entity63 says			0
" it may not be pretty , but you will get the job done			0
" it 's also crucial that couples communicate clearly and effectively , @entity63 says			1
too often , one partner will fixate on solving the problem while neglecting to listen to the other 's needs			0
in the @entity12 ' case , @entity28 says he would search for care facilities for his father from time to time , but @entity5 was still left to shoulder most of the daily duties of care -- something her husband still feels guilty about			1
with their three children grown , " it was her time to have and here she was taking care of my dad , " @entity28 laments			1
it was n't until the @entity12 finally found room for @entity120 at the @entity122 facility that they finally found some relief			0
" we knew there was a light at the end of the tunnel , " @entity28 says			0
balancing your needs although finding a balance between caring for an aging parent and maintaining a healthy marriage can be tremendously challenging , it can be done , experts say			1
part of that solution is ensuring the aging parent gets proper care , says @entity139 , senior psychologist at @entity140 in @entity141 , @entity72			1
" when the psychological needs of the care recipient are addressed , this can no doubt have a positive effect on the marital relationship of the caregivers , " she says			1
it 's also important that couples care for one another			1
@entity151 , a 58 - year - old holistic healer in @entity153 , grew frustrated that he could n't take a vacation with his wife for fear of leaving his live - in mother - in - law alone , even though she was in good health			0
so the couple decided to take weekend trips , making sure neighbors and loved ones were on standby in case of an emergency			0
the @entity31 did n't have the luxury of traveling while @entity120 was still alive			0
although they say their marriage has stabilized since his passing -- @entity5 has been able to devote more time to her job coordinating a local volleyball league -- they admit that it could have crumbled			0
" we nearly crashed and burned , " @entity28 says			0
how to cope author @entity174 offers the following tips for coping when a couple 's " for better or worse " turns to the latter in caring for an elderly parent : talk it out			1
bring in a third party such as an attorney to provide objective perspective			0
those short on money can invite clergy or a neighbor			0
make time for yourself -- and each other			0
