-- remember the @entity1 ? five years ago , the buzzing gadget was all the rage -- the rock star of mobile communication and seemingly every office drone 's high - tech status symbol			1
sober - minded professionals talked about @entity1 addiction and " phantom vibrations " that caused users to reach for the devices even when they were n't actually doing anything			1
" it 's like @entity25 's dog , " @entity14 , a technology investor , told the @entity16 in 2007 , referring to the gut - level longing users felt for the click - clack of the phone 's keyboard and humming notice that a new personal message had arrived			1
fast - forward to thursday , and what was the word ? " depressing			0
that 's the only word that comes to mind after reading the @entity36 financial results press release and listening to the conference call , " @entity29 wrote for the site @entity1 , which emerged in 2007 , eight years after @entity1 's first two - way paging device was released			1
" ( @entity38 ) as crappy as the results were , i 'm not going to write up a death certificate for @entity36 here			2
and that shows that the folks who still love their blackberry still really love their @entity1			2
but let 's be clear : some analysts do say it 's over for the @entity1			1
" anyone who 's been paying attention is n't surprised by @entity1 maker @entity52 's recent collapse , " a blogger for @entity49 wrote			1
" it 's unfortunate , but it 's been inevitable			0
" @entity1 maker @entity52 announced thursday it is laying off 5,000 people -- and said earnings for the past three months were significantly less than expected , with the company reporting a first - quarter loss of $ 518 million			1
sales were down 40 % from last year			0
furthermore , the new operating system it 's pinning its hopes on will be delayed until next year , or , a full year after it was originally expected			0
couple all of that with more reports that the company might be looking to sell off its once dominant service , and you had what amounted to a devastating head - kick for the @entity72 company			0
it capped off a gut - punch of a financial year that has seen @entity36 's stock price drop 70 %			1
so , what happened ? as an even more gadget - obsessed society than we were five years ago , how did we stop being @entity1 fiends			2
photos : our mobile " addiction " well , how 's this for cruel and cosmic irony ? a day after the dismal report , something called the @entity87 celebrated its fifth birthday			1
you might have heard of it			0
about 217 million of them have been sold			0
it may not have been the very first smartphone			0
but @entity94 made it sexy			2
and the @entity1 , to many , would soon become the thing they give you at work			2
" @entity94 's new @entity87 could do to the cell phone market what the @entity103 did to the portable music player market : crush it pitilessly beneath the weight of its own superiority , " @entity100 wrote for @entity101			1
" this is unfortunate for anybody else who makes cell phones , but it 's good news for those of us who use them			0
" the guy has since written a book called " @entity119			0
" he must have had a crystal ball			0
critics say @entity36 was too slow to react			2
to be sure , it maintained ( and , to some degree , still does ) the hard - core business user more concerned about reliability and security than playing " @entity127			0
" but for many , the thrill was gone			0
by the time they brought a touchscreen @entity1 to market , the second - generation @entity129 was already capturing hearts and minds			2
and even the goal of becoming the " other smartphone " got further away when @entity137 unleashed its android operating system and opened it up to phone makers everywhere			0
the first @entity141 phone , the @entity140 , hit stores in october 2008 , around the same time as the @entity143			0
@entity137 's quicker response paid dividends , and now there are more phones running @entity141 phones than there are @entity87			1
ditto all of the above for the @entity151 , @entity36 's entry into the tablet market that , to be kind , failed to meet sales goals			1
none of this , as @entity155 notes , means your @entity1 will be a useless brick in the near future			2
@entity36 still has 78 million subscribers and $ 2.2 billion in cash on hand			1
but as a cultural icon , it 's hard to see the magic of the mid- 2000s returning for the @entity1			1
it 's enough to make you want to tap out a condolence note for the company -- even if many of us will be doing so on a touchscreen			0
' @entity1 , ' @entity173 and @entity94 get just desserts			1

after @entity1 heyday , @entity52 has seen hard times
maker of @entity1 reported *big* losses and *layoffs*
@entity94 's @entity87 release in 2007 helped start the *decline*
@entity36 still has billions on hand and 78 million subscribers
