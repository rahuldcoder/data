-- @entity2 's young golfers mixed the rough with the smooth on an historic day at the @entity4 on thursday			1
@entity5 underlined @entity2 's prodigious golfing talent as he teed off to become the youngest player in the history of the @entity9 at the age of 12 years and 242 days			1
it was also a day to remember for another of @entity2 's young talent pool as 16 - year - old @entity14 signed for an impressive two - under - par 70 in @entity15			1
" i was bit nervous at the start , had a bogey on the third but then came back really well with four birdies , " said @entity14 , who was joint 11th after the first day 's play in a group including compatriot @entity18			1
" this is obviously by far the biggest event i have ever entered , so i am very excited to be part of it			0
" this is a very long , tough course for me			0
on a couple of the longer par fours , i need to hit my wood from the fairway to have any chance of reaching the greens			0
" i hit a bit of a top off the first tee and only carried it 230 yards , but it was okay because i still got a par. " @entity5 also made a solid start on the back nine at the @entity40 , holing a birdie at the par - four 14th to cancel out his dropped shot on the 13th to card a creditable 38 at the turn			1
but the schoolboy from the southern manufacturing hub of @entity46 lost momentum over the front nine , dropping five bogeys for a final seven - over - par score of 79			1
@entity5 , who balances his homework with his golfing career , now faces a battle to survive the halfway cut at the $ 3.2 million tournament			2
" it 's the first time i 've played with a baby ! " said his 35 - year - old @entity56 playing partner @entity55			1
" i think i was playing on the computer at 12 , not playing in a big tournament on the @entity9			2
" he 's definitely got something about him			0
he knows how to manage himself out on the course , and i 'm sure he 's going to go a long way in the game			0
" he hits it a long way for his age and he 's got a very good short game			0
i was impressed with him			0
" the 15 - year - old @entity70 , who earned his place in the field after winning the @entity73 , finished the day on 11 over			1
they are following in the footsteps of @entity76 , who drew global focus on @entity2 's young talent with his sensational @entity80 debut last month			1
the 14 - year - old made the halfway cut as the youngest player to enter the prestigious major and finished as @entity85 's leading amateur			1
@entity76 was invited to play at the @entity87 event in @entity88 last week , where he also made the cut but then finished 71st -- bottom of the players who made it to the weekend rounds			0
back at the @entity4 , @entity95 @entity94 held the first - round lead after a late birdie run took the 39 - year - old to a six - under 66			1
@entity100 's @entity99 , @entity102 @entity101 and @entity104 @entity103 were tied for second two shots further back			2
former @entity107 @entity4 champion @entity106 was still in the hunt on 69 but @entity111 's new @entity110 captain @entity109 finished four over for the day			2
@entity113 ruling meanwhile , golf 's governing bodies have backed the decision by officials at the masters not to disqualify @entity113 from last month 's tournament even though the world no. 1 was found guilty of infringing the rules			1
@entity85 's rules committee deemed @entity113 had violated one of golf 's ball - drop rules during the second round and handed him a two - stroke penalty			1
but there had been calls for @entity113 to be disqualified from the tournament after he incorrectly signed for a round of 71			2
the 14 - time major winner hit a shot on the 15th hole that ricocheted off the flagstick and bounced into a pond			0
@entity113 took a drop but later conceded he had not taken the drop at the same place as the original spot -- an infringement that warrants a two - shot penalty			2
at the time , officials determined @entity113 had n't broken any rules and so did not disqualify @entity113 for signing an improper scorecard because it made its " initial determination prior to the finish of the player 's round			1
" it was only under further scrutiny from the television coverage -- prompted by an inquiry from a viewer -- that @entity113 was retrospectively punished , but was not penalized for the incorrectly signed scorecard			0
the @entity158 and the @entity159 supported the decision made at @entity85 -- but stressed it should not set a precedent for future incidents			0
the joint statement explained : " in returning his score card , @entity113 had breached rule 6 - 6d by returning a score ( 6 ) for the 15th hole that was lower than his actual score ( 8 )			2
" the penalty for such a breach of rule 6 - 6d is disqualification			0
under rule 33 - 7 , a committee has discretion to waive that penalty in ' exceptional individual cases			0
' @entity176 elected to invoke that discretion and waived @entity113 ' penalty of disqualification			0
" the decisions on the @entity182 authorize a committee to correct an incorrect decision before the competition has closed , and they establish that where a @entity176 incorrectly advises a competitor , before he returns his scorecard , that he has incurred no penalty , and then subsequently corrects its mistake , it is appropriate for the committee to waive the disqualification penalty			0
" the @entity113 ruling was based on exceptional facts and should not be viewed as a general precedent for relaxing or ignoring a competitor 's essential obligation under the @entity198 to return a correct score card			2
