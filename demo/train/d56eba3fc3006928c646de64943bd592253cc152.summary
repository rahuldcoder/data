editor 's note : @entity2 is a bestselling author whose current book is " when we get to @entity5 : a journey through @entity7 in @entity8			1
" @entity2 says one dentist in @entity10 found an ingenious way of keeping his chair filled with patients			1
( @entity14 ) -- you may not have the answer for how to thrive in a lousy economy			0
i may not have the answer for how to thrive in a lousy economy			0
but the truck stop dentist figured it out a long time ago			1
" when your dental practice is in a truck stop , you do n't have a lot of patients coming in for their six - month cleanings , " said dr. @entity22			1
" you have people walking in holding their jaws in pain			0
treatment is not optional -- they need to see a dentist , and they need to see me now			2
" dr. @entity22 's one - man dental office is inside the @entity39 , at @entity40 of @entity41 , near the small town of @entity43			1
the complex proclaims itself to be the world 's largest truck stop , and if you 've never been there -- well , the truck stop itself is probably a story for another time			1
suffice it to say that the establishment is spread over 200 acres , that it features its own movie theater , a 300 - seat restaurant with a 50 - foot salad bar , the @entity56 ( more than 75,000 truck - related items for sale , festooned with enough gleaming chrome to make you reach for your sunglasses )			2
but the topic for today is dr. @entity22 , and how he ended up offering root canals in a building where people stop for diesel fuel			2
these desperate economic times highlight the importance of individual inventiveness and ingenuity -- and a dentist has to be beyond ingenious to gaze upon an @entity10 truck stop and figure out : a fellow could make himself a pretty nice living in there			1
" i had a regular dental practice over in @entity78 , " dr. @entity22 , 48 , told me			1
" i had an advertisement in the @entity80			0
and in the early 1990s i noticed that i kept getting calls from truckers who were in a phone booth out by the @entity39			2
they had stopped for fuel , and they were in a lot of pain , and they absolutely had to see a dentist			2
" now ... @entity43 , the town adjacent to the truck stop , has only 1,500 residents			1
but the truck stop itself caters to an estimated 5,000 customers a day , most of them long - haul truckers passing through			1
the light bulb above dr. @entity22 's head snapped on			0
" i made arrangements with the truck stop to open up an office , " he said			1
" at first i split my practice between my old office in @entity78 and the truck stop office			1
but i ended up closing the old one			0
my entire practice is in the truck stop now			1
" business is good , he said , even during the recession			2
there have been stories from around the country about doctors and dentists seeing fewer patients , because people just do n't have the money to come in for regular checkups			1
but a truck stop dental office is not a place where patients come because they have planned it -- a truck stop dental office is a place where patients come because they need immediate relief			1
" the sentence i hear the most often is , ' do you pull teeth ? ' " dr. @entity22 said			0
" someone will come in with his hand to his face , and he 'll want to have a tooth extracted			0
he will have heard that i 'm here			0
" but how do truckers learn about dr. @entity22 's practice ? " word of mouth , " he said			2
) the business model of most dental offices , he said , is based on teeth - cleaning : a dentist builds up his or her list of loyal patients and their families who come in to get their teeth cleaned , and when they need fillings or crowns , the office is there for them			1
the truck stop dentist , by necessity , turns that business model inside out			1
" i usually see a patient once , and then never see him again , " he said			0
" truckers are n't going to say to me , ' i 'll be back for a cleaning on september 23 at 2 in the afternoon			2
' they ca n't plan where they 're going to be			1
i make patient files for the people who come in , but i know that i 'll probably never have a reason to open the files after they walk out the door			0
these are mostly one - time patients			0
" he does n't have the luxury of knowing , at the beginning of a day , how many patients he will see -- or even if he will see any			2
" it can range from zero patients in a day to 15 , " he said			0
" it 's unusual for a patient to call in advance			0
i 'll know i have a patient when the door opens and a trucker walks in , with that look on his face			0
" dr. @entity22 's success , he said , is based on two factors : the steady flow of those 35,000 people who pull in to the truck stop every week , and the actuarial certainty that some of them will be truckers with a mouthful of hurt			1
" i had a guy who came in yesterday who told me he was in such pain that he had tried to pull his own tooth , " dr. @entity22 said			0
" i told him there was no need for that			0
i told him that i could help him			0
" it does get a little lonely out at @entity40 , not being able to build up a continuing relationship with his patients , the way most dentists do			0
sometimes , as a patient is getting up from the chair to leave , dr. @entity22 will find himself saying : " make sure you try to get your dispatcher to send you back this way			0
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			2
