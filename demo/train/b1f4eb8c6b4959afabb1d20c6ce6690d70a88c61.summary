blog : court ruling sets dangerous precedent			0
but both men have had their suspensions quashed by the @entity26 high court sitting in @entity27			0
the pair were also seeking substantial damages against the @entity12 of $ 1.5 million , but they have been awarded € 15,000 ( $ 21,630 ) and € 5,000 ( $ 7,220 ) respectively			0
the court gave the @entity12 15 days to pay @entity1 and @entity13 , otherwise it will be given a penalty of € 10,000 ( $ 14,420 ) per day			1
the @entity12 has yet announce whether it will appeal the ruling			0
the court said that it had not annulled the decision by the @entity9 , but ruled it to be " irregular " and non-effective due to @entity39 's level of involvement , the @entity34 @entity33 reported			2
" the decision of the @entity43 was presided over by the @entity12 president , who was well - known to be in conflict with @entity1 , with mr @entity39 having played a leading role in launching the inquiry and its investigation in violation of the principle of separation of the power of the bodies , " its judgment said			2
the 59 - year - old @entity1 said " justice has been done " , the @entity54 reported			1
" as a sports person and one passionately involved in car racing for more than 20 years , the decision to apply to the civil courts to contest a decision of the @entity12 was a difficult one for me to take , " the @entity56 said			0
" the fact the @entity9 had been utilised to deal with a personal agenda aimed at pushing me out of the world of competition left me no other choice			0
" the decision handed down today restores to me the dignity and freedom certain people had arbitrarily attempted to deprive me of			0
" the court recognised all the criticisms i had formulated against the decision of the @entity43 were founded , by finding the @entity12 had rendered a decision it was not competent to pronounce , infringed its own articles of association , totally failed to respect my right to a fair defense and entrusted the tasks of investigation , prosecution and judgment to a principle player known by all to be hostile to me			0
" @entity1 said he would " enjoy this moment of happiness " before discussing whether he planned to return to @entity3			2
the court decision came soon after @entity7 , handed a two - year suspended ban at the @entity12 hearing over the @entity19 incident , announced that @entity26 @entity89 had been appointed as @entity1 's replacement as team principal			1
the team is attempting to restore its reputation in the aftermath of the @entity19 incident , which came to light after @entity15 was sacked and then went public with his admission of involvement			2
double world champion @entity17 of @entity98 won the race -- the first for @entity7 in two years -- despite starting from 15th on the grid			1
just two laps after @entity17 came in early to take on more fuel , @entity15 's crash forced the deployment of the safety car and the subsequent pit stop of nearly all the other drivers -- an action that promoted @entity17 to fifth from where he went on to secure victory .			1
