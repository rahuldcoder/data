as new allegations emerged surrounding the @entity4 bidding process for the @entity6 finals , an @entity1 former anti-terrorism lawyer will interview leading figures from @entity9 's bid team in @entity10 monday			1
those interviews will take place against the backdrop of calls for a new vote on which country should host the 2022 event			1
@entity9 has promised laywer @entity19 " full cooperation " after soccer 's global governing body was engulfed in new scandal following a @entity26 newspaper 's damning investigation into the bidding process for the @entity6 finals			1
the story alleges a @entity30 official paid more than $ 5 million in an attempt to secure support for his country 's successful bid to host the 2022 tournament			1
the @entity36 alleges that @entity37 made secret payments to soccer officials in the run up to the controversial ballot			2
@entity42 , the former president of the @entity43 , was a member of @entity4 's powerful 24 - person executive committee charged with voting on who hosted the finals at the time of the vote in 2010			1
despite the country 's small size , a technical report from @entity4 calling its bid " high risk " and summer temperatures that can exceed 50 degrees @entity52 ( 122 degrees @entity53 ) , @entity9 shocked the world by winning the right to host the 2022 finals , defeating bids by the @entity1 , @entity61 , @entity62 and @entity63			1
@entity4 vice-president @entity64 has said he would back a re-vote , potentially opening the possibility of the @entity1 staging the 2022 tournament			1
when @entity4 voted on who should host the @entity9 in 2010 , the organization 's president @entity67 reportedly voted for the @entity1 , while a potential rival for the presidency , @entity73 chief @entity72 , voted for @entity9			1
' millions ' of e-mails the @entity36 claims to have seen millions of e-mails detailing payments to officials in the @entity77 , @entity78 and the @entity79 designed to secure support for the tiny , gas - rich @entity83 emirate 's quixotic bid to host the world 's most popular sports tournament			1
" bit by bit , we have been unraveling it and finally we hit the mother lode , " @entity86 , deputy editor of the @entity36 , told @entity87 in an interview			0
" we 've seen millions of documents that prove without a shadow of doubt that corruption was involved			0
there is clear evidence linking payments to people who have influence over the decision of who hosted the @entity6			1
" you also have a bunch of officials with a bearing on the vote begging favors			0
they were prepared to sell their influence			0
what @entity37 was doing was buying people up who could have influence			0
" denial from the 2022 bid committee @entity37 responded by saying he would not be making any comments other than he believed " that the truth will find its way to ( the ) public one way or another			2
" the @entity9 2022 bid committee strenuously denies any wrongdoing or knowledge of any payments made on its behalf			1
" @entity37 played no official or unofficial role in @entity9 's @entity131 , " it said in a statement sent to @entity87			2
" as was the case with every other member of @entity4 's executive committee , our bid team had to convince mr. @entity37 of the merits of our bid			1
... " following today 's newspaper articles , we vehemently deny all allegations of wrongdoing			0
" we will take whatever steps are necessary to defend the integrity of @entity9 's bid and our lawyers are looking into this matter			2
" the right to host the tournament was won because it was the best bid and because it is time for the @entity83 to host its first @entity6			1
" dogged by allegations almost as soon as @entity9 won the bid to host the @entity9 finals , the process was dogged by allegations of bribery and corruption			1
in the run - up to the 2010 vote , two @entity4 executive committee members were suspended after another @entity36 investigation filmed @entity163 's @entity162 and @entity165 's @entity164 appearing to offer to sell their votes in exchange for money			1
@entity42 was banned from all football - related activities for life after first being accused of offering bribes to soccer officials in the @entity77 seeking support for his doomed 2011 bid to replace @entity67 as @entity4 president			2
he was cleared of those allegations after a hearing at the @entity179 but was later banned for different " conflict of interest " charges relating to his time as @entity43 president			0
ethics investigation the @entity36 ' allegations come ahead of a @entity4 - commissioned ethics investigation into the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 tournaments			1
that two - year investigation has been led by @entity19			0
" we are cooperating fully with mr. @entity19 's ongoing investigation and remain totally confident that any objective enquiry ( sic ) will conclude we won the bid to host the @entity9 fairly , " the @entity9 bid team added in its statement			1
several leading figures in the sport have called for the vote over hosting the @entity9 finals to be rerun			1
" i certainly as a member of the executive committee would have absolutely no problem whatsoever if the recommendation ( in @entity19 's report ) was for a revote , " @entity4 vice president @entity64 told the @entity202 on sunday			1
but @entity4 's head of media , @entity209 , told @entity87 that @entity64 was not speaking to the @entity202 on behalf of @entity4 when he mentioned a rerun of the vote and that the organization would not be making a statement until after @entity19 's meeting with the @entity30 delegation in @entity10			1
@entity19 did n't immediately reply to attempts by @entity87 to contact him			0
murky world of favors and junkets the 11 - page @entity36 investigation uncovers an alleged murky world of international payments , favors and junkets			2
among the allegations are claims that @entity37 ran a network of 10 slush funds to make payments to 30 @entity78 football officials and that up to $ 1.6 million had been paid to former @entity4 vice president @entity233			1
although the @entity9 bid team denies any involvement from @entity37 , a 2010 interview seems to suggest he did have some role to play			2
" when it comes to executive committee members , we do n't really get involved in what happens inside the committee because @entity4 is very strict , " the bid 's chairman , sheikh @entity238 , told @entity240 a month before the 2010 vote			1
" but outside the executive committee and within the bid itself , @entity37 has been a very good mentor to us			1
he 's been very helpful in advising us how to go about with our messaging and can have the biggest impact			0
" he 's always been advising us and always been by our side			0
he 's definitely our biggest asset in the bid			0
" the @entity79 connection one of the most damaging claims centers on the fate of the former head of the @entity258 , @entity164			0
after @entity164 had been caught on camera allegedly offering to sell his vote , he was suspended from the executive committee and had , according to the e-mails seen by the @entity36 , been preparing to resign , allowing his deputy to vote in his stead			1
but the @entity36 alleges that @entity37 paid @entity164 's legal fees of $ 300,000 before the @entity165 decided that he would not resign after all and would instead fight the charges			0
that move effectively took a vote in the executive committee away the @entity258 , which was likely to choose @entity9 's rival @entity61			1
" i do n't know whether it is a smoking gun , but the @entity164 allegations are very significant , " said @entity273 , one of the world 's leading journalists on @entity4 's @entity6 bidding process			1
" what it shows is clear manipulation by someone very close to the bid , " he added			0
@entity273 believes that many of the accusations of bribery and illicit payments could be connected to @entity37 's abortive presidential campaign rather than the 2022 vote			2
" putting someone ( a soccer official ) from , say , @entity291 up in a five - star hotel and giving them $ 5,000 wo n't win you the @entity6 bid , " he said			2
" but it will get that person 's support for a @entity4 presidential bid			2
and that could have future use			0
" @entity67 and @entity4 to blame ? the problem , he believes , goes even deeper than corrupt payments from a few individuals			2
" it 's not about @entity37 or even @entity9 , " @entity273 said			2
" it is about a system that is rotten to the core and easily manipulated			0
there 's also serious questions that need to be asked about @entity67			0
" @entity42 was heavily involved in his ( @entity67 's presidential ) campaign in 1998			0
was he using these tactics to help defeat @entity314 ? questions need to be asked			0
" the @entity36 has promised to release more revelations in the run - up to the @entity6 in @entity318 , which starts in less than two weeks			2
" @entity9 itself should call for a rerun of the vote , " @entity319 believes			1
" the bid was tainted			0
we are not saying there 's no right of the @entity83 to host the @entity6			2
but @entity9 won through corrupt means			1
" how can you host the @entity6 with integrity ? that is why they should press for the vote to be rerun			1
and if not they should be forced			0
@entity4 's reputation is at stake			0
it is crying out for reform			0
" the end game ? the latest allegations come after a slew of negative reports surrounding @entity9 's hosting of the @entity9 finals			2
attempts to move the tournament from summer to winter have angered @entity73 's powerful and rich soccer leagues			0
allegations of migrant worker abuse under the so - called kafala system of sponsorship , which has been heavily criticized by international human rights groups , have also tainted what had been greeted as a jubilant moment in @entity9 's short history			0
but the latest allegations , coupled with @entity19 's imminent report on the bid process , could be the beginning of the end game			0
" this is a turning point , " said @entity273			0
" for the first time we have seen hard allegations regarding manipulation of the bid process			0
" i think this is the beginning of the end			0
