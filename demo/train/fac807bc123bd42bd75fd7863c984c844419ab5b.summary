-- four @entity2 farmers and the environmental group @entity3 took oil giant @entity4 to court thursday in the @entity5 to demand a proper cleanup and compensation for pollution in the @entity9			1
the farmers want the @entity12 - @entity5 multinational to " clean up the oil pollution in their fields and fishponds " and make sure their pipelines are maintained and kept secure to prevent leaks in the future			2
the civil case has been filed against the @entity2 subsidiary of @entity4 , the @entity21 ( @entity21 ) , and its international headquarters in the @entity5 , @entity4			1

the three villages concerned are @entity34 , hit by a spill in 2004 , @entity36 , affected by a spill a year later , and @entity38 , hit by various spills in 2007 , according to @entity3			0
@entity4 argues that it has cleaned up the spills to the satisfaction of the @entity2 authorities , and has no case to answer			1
but @entity3 says that oil pollution has had a devastating and continuing impact on vegetation , water supplies and local fishing ponds			0
the campaign group says this is the first time a @entity5 company has been brought before a court in the @entity5 over environmental damage caused abroad			1
" it is also the first time that the headquarters of a multinational concern on the @entity58 continent has been summoned to appear in court for environmental or human rights violations in a developing country , " it said			0
@entity4 insists it is " committed to cleaning up all spills from its facilities " and blames saboteurs who steal oil from its pipelines for much of the environmental damage			1

" the real tragedy of the @entity9 is the widespread and continual criminal activity , including sabotage , theft and illegal refining , that causes the vast majority of oil spills , " @entity4 spokesman @entity70 said in a statement thursday			1
" it is this criminality which all organizations with an interest in @entity2 's future should focus their efforts on highlighting and addressing			2
" @entity70 said that @entity4 had cleaned up three leaks at three locations , from 2004 to 2007 , which were caused by sabotage			2
under @entity2 law , oil companies are not liable to pay compensation for damage caused by sabotage spills , he said			1
the court is expected to hear from both sides in the case thursday and will probably deliver a verdict late this year or early in 2013 , @entity3 said			0
" hopefully , the legal route that @entity27 has chosen will ensure not only that four people in the @entity9 have a better life but also increase the opportunity for thousands of their fellow citizens and millions of people worldwide who now often are without rights against powerful and sometimes unscrupulous multinationals , " campaign coordinator @entity96 said			0
the argument over the impact of oil production in the @entity9 , which includes the @entity110 region , is a long - running one			0
