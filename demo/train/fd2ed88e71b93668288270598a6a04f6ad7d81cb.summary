campus republicans at the @entity1 have cooked up a storm of controversy with their plans for a bake sale			2
but it 's not your everyday collegiate fundraiser they 've got in mind			0
they 've developed a sliding scale where the price of the cookie or brownie depends on your gender and the color of your skin			2
during the sale , scheduled for tuesday , baked goods will be sold to white men for $ 2.00 , @entity23 men for $ 1.50 , @entity24 men for $ 1.00 , black men for $ 0.75 and @entity26 men for $ 0.25			1
all women will get $ 0.25 off those prices			0
" the pricing structure is there to bring attention , to cause people to get a little upset , " campus @entity29 president @entity29 , who planned the event , told @entity33 - affiliate @entity32			1
" but it 's really there to cause people to think more critically about what this kind of policy would do in university admissions			2
" @entity29 says it 's a way to make a statement about pending legislation that would let the @entity49 universities consider race or national origin during the admission process			1
but the young @entity53 have been on the receiving end of a fierce backlash			0
reaction has been so negative they 've been forced to cancel their customary lunchtime tabling duties , according to @entity32			0
@entity29 told @entity33 's @entity60 that they expected a certain amount of opposition but not the level of outrage they experienced			1
" we did n't expect the volume , the amount of response that we got , " @entity29 said			1
" in the first few hours , hundreds of posts on our @entity72 page			0
and the tone of some of the responses -- we expected people to be upset			2
we did n't expect personal threats to be made			0
they were implicit and explicit threats made to the organizers of the event , from burning down the table to throwing our baked goods at us and other kinds of physical threats			1
" @entity86 , author of the book " @entity88 : reflections on race from a @entity92 , " calls the bake sale a " sarcastic and rather smarmy slap at people of color			1
" " there are a lot of ways to make a point about your disagreement with affirmative action , " @entity86 told lemon saturday night			1
" i get the joke , " he continued			0
it 's been done for 15 years			0
the point that i think needs to be made ... is that by the time anyone steps on a college campus ... there has already been 12 - to 13 - years of institutionalized affirmative action for white folks , that is to say , racially embedded inequality , which has benefited those of us who are white			0
and it 's only at the point of college admissions that these folks seem to get concerned with color consciousness			0
" @entity29 insists , however , that @entity121 will go ahead with their bake sale and are committed to their controversial pricing structure .			1
