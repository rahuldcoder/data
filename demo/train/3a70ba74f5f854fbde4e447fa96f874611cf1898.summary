@entity0 , @entity1 -- as people head to the polls in @entity1 , the campaigns will learn whether all the funds used for direct marketing to voters was money well - spent			1
mailings , robocalls , phone surveys , doorknob hangers , mass e-mails , texts -- it 's next to impossible to find a registered @entity18 or independent voter in the @entity1 who has n't received several of each			1
a group of voters in the @entity0 area told @entity2 some left an impression but most wound up in the trash or had no impact on their decision			1
while every candidate sent out something to voters , the group said one politician in particular went beyond the others			2
" with @entity37 , it 's been almost a case of overkill , " said @entity34 , a registered @entity18 and small business owner from @entity35			1
" i do n't understand why if he 's been leading the polls here all along			0
" @entity42 received several mailings and phone calls from the @entity37 campaign			1
but he seemed more understanding			0
" it 's a competition ; i mean you ca n't ease up , " said the @entity18 from @entity47			0
" if you want to win , you have to go 100 %			0
i think that 's what @entity37 's doing			1
so i think that makes sense			0
" that method did n't have the same effect on @entity55 , a registered @entity18 : " my take on it is he spends an inordinate amount of time focus - group testing everything he says and sanitizing it to find the exact way to phrase it , " @entity55 said			0
in addition to multiple mailings from the @entity37 campaign , the vice president of sales and marketing at the @entity69 also received several survey calls			1
" it made me pay attention to what he 's doing because i feel like everything is calculated			0
" but @entity76 said he sees it differently			0
the @entity18 from @entity0 said he thinks it shows that @entity37 has a team in place that can take him all the way to the @entity81			1
" i think having the political infrastructure to win a campaign is important , especially for a candidate who wants to go up against ( president ) @entity88 , " said @entity76 , who has lived in the state most of his life and voted in several presidential primaries			0
" he 's done a lot of @entity90 of voters ... so he can understand who he needs to go after and who he needs to target			2
" @entity76 said he has received at least two mailings each week from the @entity37 campaign for the past few months			1
the glossy fliers with images of @entity37 and quotes from people supporting him did n't win over @entity18 @entity100			2
" i 'm looking for substance , " said the real estate consultant from @entity0			2
" empty promises are not really attractive to me			0
i 'm looking for people who use straight talk and give promises that they can deliver on after the election			0
" @entity100 said he did n't get that from the mailings and phone calls			1
most of the fliers wound up in his trash bin			0
one piece of marketing material did have an impact on @entity34			0
" there was one from @entity37 that i did actually open because it was almost like a booklet			2
it was interesting because it shows his @entity1 supporters and a lot of the names in here are people that i support and like			2
" their support for @entity37 made her take another look at the candidate			2
but on the same day she received that booklet two other @entity37 mailings arrived at her house			1
they landed in the garbage			0
@entity37 may have blitzed the state with mailings and phone calls			1
but rep. @entity139 followed closely behind him , according to the voters taking part in the discussion			1
but most of @entity139 's mailings were the opposite of @entity37 's glossy postcards			1
the @entity149 lawmaker 's campaign often sent out long letters laying out the case for his positions on multiple issues			2
while @entity157 's mailbox was refilled every day , her phone was also ringing often			2
" i got a lot of robocalls			0
i got a lot of surveys , " said @entity157 , an independent voter from @entity160 who said she felt the most effective ones came from @entity139 's campaign			1
" i was impressed with two of them that actually caused me to go to an event in @entity169 a few days ago			0
" she said the robocalls concerned issues about which she cared			0
she said she had n't really looked at @entity139 's positions before these calls			1
the folks who participated in the conversation unanimously expressed disdain for the calls and mailings that attacked other candidates ' positions			1
yet they still received them from the campaigns or organizations supporting them .			0
