if you 've seen the 1992 movie , you may remember when @entity5 as @entity6 and @entity7 as @entity8 are parked near an airport runway			1
they 're reclining on the hood of a funky @entity12 , discussing " @entity14 - raham @entity13 , " when suddenly a huge airliner swoops by just a few feet overhead			2
that 's when they begin screaming above the airplane 's deafening roar			2
" i 've done that			2
there are so many times when i just want to ... lay down near the approach lights and watch the planes go overhead and just take it in			2
" he 's talking about plane spotting			1
beginning around the mid- 20th century , countless plane spotters have been trotting the globe to view and photograph the world 's most impressive aircraft			1
schwing ! " some people like cars , " said @entity20			2
" but we like something that 's bigger and faster , and it freaking flies			2
" @entity20 , who created the plane spotting site @entity39 in 2003 , said the hobby is growing more popular as more people are lured in by the magic of flying machines			1
think about it , said @entity20 , " something that weighs up to a million pounds is taking to the air , and you know the next time it comes down is going to be on the other side of the world			2
i think that 's fascinating			2

intrigued ? we 've listed some tips and suggested vantage points below			1
but first , let 's talk about what 's arguably the most famous plane spotting destination on the planet : @entity63 on the tiny @entity65 island of @entity66			1
you may have seen @entity68 in unbelievable interweb photos showing giant airliners flying just a few dozen feet above the beach			0
these photos went viral years ago , and no , they are n't photoshopped			0
" if you like airplanes , @entity68 is like the cherry on top " of a beautiful beach vacation , said @entity74 , a 747 pilot who 's visited @entity75 several times			0
for @entity52 , @entity68 is the " mecca of airplane spotting			1
" the beach sits at one end of a short runway at @entity86			0
the short runway forces approaching planes to come in low , about 30 to 50 feet over the beach			0
larger planes need to touchdown as close as possible to the end of the runway because they need as much runway as they can get			0
as a result , plane spotters get one of the world 's closest public views of giant airliners as they take off and land			1
" it 's a lot closer than you can get at a typical airport , in the @entity105 especially , " said @entity74			1

" people literally try to see if they can touch the planes , " she said			0
" in our office , when they 're taking off or coming in , it 's almost like it was an earthquake			0
" but paradise for plane spotters also has its dangers			1
when airliners prepare for take off and rev their engines , daredevils will stand against the airport fence and hold on			1
the jet blast is powerful enough to throw people off the fence and onto the ground			0
spotters say their hobby is more than a celebration of aviation			1
it 's about fully recognizing the majesty of machines that give us the super power to defy gravity			0
and , perhaps surprisingly , it 's also about camaraderie			0
yes , that is correct			0
plane spotting at popular vantage points comes with a social bonus			1
" when you have a group of 20 people with a lot of different personalities and people from all walks of life , it 's a very diverse group , and we have a great time , " said @entity20			0
some plane spotters will even hook up on occasion , @entity20 said , because obviously there 's nothing more romantic than a roaring @entity163 blotting out the moon and lighting up the night sky			1
