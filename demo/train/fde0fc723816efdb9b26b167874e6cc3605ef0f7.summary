@entity0 was n't a reader , until the words finally spoke directly to him			1
it was n't until college that @entity0 read an entire novel , " @entity6			1
" at first , he did n't like it			2
but by the time he finished , he was on the verge of tears			0
that story , and others , became his gateway to literature , while spoken - word poetry was his gateway to writing			2
" ' @entity17 ' by @entity18 was the first book that made me think i might be able to make writing my livelihood , " de la @entity0 said			0
" and i thought , ' wait , people publish the kind of stories i write ? ' that novel made me feel like publishing was a possibility			0
and then i started digging in on the hard work			0
" finding himself on the page -- and characters he could relate to -- made him who he is today			0
he 's now a creative writing teacher and award - winning author of " @entity33 , " " @entity34 " and " @entity35			1
" he writes his experiences , usually with stories starring @entity40 - @entity39 characters			0
" where 's the @entity44 @entity43 or the @entity41 asked			1
" that would change the game			0
" according to the @entity49 , fewer children 's books were written by @entity50 or african - americans in 2013 than in previous years			2
numbers increased slightly for @entity53 and @entity54			0
there were also more books written about @entity50 and @entity53 , but fewer about african - americans and @entity54			0
this concerns some in the industry , as @entity39 youth become more diverse			0
young people from ages 10 to 18 represent 13.6 % of the @entity39 population , according to the 2012 @entity64			2
more than 16 % are african - american , 12.2 % are @entity54 and 17.7 % are @entity66			0
teens " are hungry for good literature and it hurts me because we 're not offering them enough of what they need , " said @entity67 , author of award - winning books like " november @entity69 " and " @entity70 " in 2014 , the movement to publish more authors of color and write multicultural main characters remains slow and incremental			1
this is not a new discussion : there has long been criticism about the lack of diversity in young adult literature , books written for readers ages 12 to 18			1
experts and authors like @entity93 point back as early as 1965 , when educator @entity94 stirred the conversation with an article entitled " the @entity97			2
" @entity93 recently wrote about the topic in the @entity99 : " as i discovered who i was , a black teenager in a white - dominated world , i saw that these characters , these lives , were not mine , " he wrote			0
" what i wanted , needed really , was to become an integral and valued part of the mosaic that i saw around me			0
" even though young adult literature is enjoying a golden age and authors are working to diversify their stories , lead characters of color or characters who are lesbian , gay , bisexual or transgender are still slow to appear in popular mainstream young adult fiction			1
without these characters , the landscape of young adult literature is n't reflective of our society , author @entity118 said			1
he 's one of many authors , teachers , librarians , publishers and editors have ideas of how to transform this persistent negative with positive changes			1
reaching more readers @entity133 and @entity134 discovered each other when they published their @entity137 young adult fantasy stories			1
what began as a book tour grew into a website , diversity in @entity142 , where they emphasize that books featuring diverse characters are for everyone -- not just people who relate directly to the characters			1
" readers look at our books and if they are n't into @entity54 culture , they think it 's not for them , " author @entity133 said , " our books are for everyone			1
it 's not just about identity			2
" after realizing his other books spoke strongly to the @entity40 - @entity39 identity angle , @entity0 decided to write a story with more mass appeal , " @entity35			0
" he 's currently writing a sequel			2
" there is an evolution within our own work , " he said			0
" when you are writing with race as one of the elements of the story , early on , you write about race			0
as you do more work , the race becomes part of the story and not the story			0
i think that will be the biggest boost for multicultural literature			2
" but on the flip side , i get worried about people who just make the character black on the outside , but not on the inside			0
" facing down challenges @entity118 's book " @entity192 " is a @entity189 winner that was hailed as one of the best reads for young people in 2007			1
it 's also one of the books most often challenged or banned in schools and libraries			2
with young adult fiction , " you can make real significant social change , " @entity118 said			1
" there is a political , social meaning and everything i believe about the way the world should be has been reflected in the way that my book has been treated , appealed to and offended people			0
" currently , there are more than 500 federally recognized tribes of @entity53 in @entity39 , according to the @entity210			0
but in young adult fiction , they are often misrepresented as romanticized " mystical @entity53 " and they do n't reflect the experience of @entity216 kids growing up on the reservation , said @entity218 , founder of @entity53 in @entity219			1
authors such as @entity118 , @entity221 , @entity222 and @entity223 are working to fight stereotypes that @entity53 can only be present in " buckskin and beads " by writing the real experience the @entity229 teens have on the reservation			2
" i 'm not this tragic figure from the past , " said @entity221 , author of " @entity231			2
" sites such as @entity234 in @entity142 encourage all writers to diversify their book characters ; after all , not every book including multicultural characters comes from an author of color			1
but for any writer deviating from his or her own experience , it requires extensive research and cultural immersion to avoid stereotypes or misconceptions			2
still , some authors feel that the publishing industry is reluctant to take risks by marketing books that do n't mimic previous successes			1
@entity254 , executive editor of @entity255 , said publishers do n't see " enormous numbers " of books from writers of color , and publishers turn down 97 % of manuscripts they receive , regardless of the topic			1
@entity265 , co-founder of the @entity266 -- a group of editors passionate about publishing books that reach and reflect the demographics of their readers -- said there 's room for improvement			1
" we want to keep hearing more and more voices , " she said			0
" it 's important to have advocates at every stage , from editing to marketing , from librarians to authors , so it 's an industry - wide effort			1
" changing the publishers authors like @entity118 and @entity93 see the growth of small press publishers of color as one way to expand multicultural representation in young adult fiction			1
" we see it time and time again : innovation comes from the small press world , " @entity118 said			0
at the @entity298 convention in late 2013 , @entity93 spoke about his dream of subsidizing publishers			0
his vision ? teaming up with a university press to host a yearly contest for people of color who write young adult fiction			1
a brief history of young adult literature the exposure to editors and publishers would benefit talented writers who otherwise have a difficult time being seen			1
" hypothetically , here are five finalists who would be exposed to all aspects of the publishing community whose voices might never be heard otherwise , " @entity93 said			0
it could be the beginning of real change in young adult fiction			1
" looking at these kids when i 'm speaking , i think , ' this is the generation , ' " de la @entity0 said			0
" they are going to write what they want and feature themselves			0
" what young adult books did you relate to as a teen ? share your thoughts in the comments , on @entity333 or on @entity336 's @entity335 page !			1

different cultural *backgrounds* are n't well represented in young adult literature , authors say
author : " where 's the @entity44 @entity43 or the @entity344 ? "
writers , educators , publishers and editors have ideas of how to transform @entity142 literature
