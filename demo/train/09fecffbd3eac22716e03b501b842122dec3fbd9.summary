-- president @entity1 spoke thursday about the unrest in @entity3 , @entity4 -- an unrest that began in response to the shooting of @entity7 , an 18 - year - old boy with no criminal record			1
while the community searched for answers about the killing , answers were slow to come -- both from city officials and police			1
the name of the officer who shot @entity7 was not released until today			0
citizens , exercising their @entity18 right to peaceful assembly , protested			0
the police have responded with riot gear , military equipment and tear gas -- banned in international warfare , but used more than once in @entity3			2
against this backdrop , president @entity1 struck the correct tone , telling the country to " take a step back to think about how to move forward			1
" he 's tasked both the @entity29 and @entity30 with independently investigating @entity7 's death , and he has spoken with @entity4 's gov. @entity32 about the details on the ground in @entity3			0
opinion : @entity1 needs to lead on racial profiling legislation while there was no direct mention of the role of race in @entity7 's killing and the protests that ensued , the president emphasized the shared values of all parties involved			1
he urged the local authorities to be transparent and to protect citizens ' rights to peacefully protest			0
he urged local citizens to refrain from looting or vandalism and to uphold public order			0
and he urged everyone to start the path to healing from this tragedy			1
full coverage of @entity3 shooting i do hope that we can begin on this path of healing , but the events in @entity3 are a microcosm of larger forces that pervade @entity68 society			1
first , initial eyewitness reports from @entity7 's friends indicate that @entity7 raised his hands and tried to explain he was unarmed , but the police officer began shooting			2
the tendency to shoot first , ask questions later -- particularly when dealing with young black men -- is an issue the police force must confront			1
second , the subsequent reluctance of the police to release details about such a grave use of deadly force is of concern			2
in a democratic society , we need the authorities responsible for protecting us and given authority to apprehend us to be responsive and transparent			0
5 things to know about @entity7 's shooting third , when the community has a grievance with the authorities , the authorities ' first response should not be an extreme crackdown , characteristic of autocratic countries like @entity96			1
to send militarized units with combat - like gear and weapons into the heart of a suburban community where protests are occurring , is deeply troubling			1
fourth , the tendency of some in the mainstream media to use pictures of @entity7 that reinforce a " thuggish " stereotype has to stop			2
the twitter hashtag # @entity109 has effectively been used to show how the media could reduce an individual to a stereotype with simply one @entity114 picture			0
opinion : @entity1 , ca n't you see black anger in @entity3 ? the situation in @entity3 is changing hourly , but there is hope			1
with gov. @entity32 's decision to take law enforcement duties out of the hands of @entity126 and put it into the hands of other law enforcement groups , there could be a return to effective law enforcement			0
i 'm glad to hear the president will continue to monitor the situation and offer federal support to ensure a transparent investigation			0
when one of our communities experiences tragedy , it deserves answers and it deserves the right to express grievances			0
i continue to pray for the family and friends of @entity7 and for a community torn apart to begin to heal .			2

@entity148 : president @entity1 struck the right tone in asking us to " move forward "
@entity148 : while race likely played a role , i hope we can begin the path of healing
she says tendency of police to shoot first and ask questions later must be dealt with
