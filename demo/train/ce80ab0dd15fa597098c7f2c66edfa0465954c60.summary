-- three days ago , i decided to write an open letter to black protesters because i could n't stay silent any longer			1
since the death of @entity6 , @entity4 has been in an intense debate over how law enforcement operates in communities of color			2
i am an @entity11 police officer -- a term that seems like an oxymoron these days -- and like thousands of other black men and women who wear blue , i exist in two worlds			1
the open letter , published by @entity19 , was an attempt to offer solutions			2
i wrote about how proud i am to see young black men and women mobilize and rally for a cause but that too many in their movement overgeneralize and paint all law enforcement as corrupt			1
i explained how , contrary to what is often portrayed , the vast majority of cops aspire to be peacekeepers and that our good work often goes unnoticed			1
finally , i offered what i believe could be achievable solutions to improve the relationship between law enforcement and the communities of color we serve			2
i wrote , referring to the protesters : " what they fail to understand is that i 'm from the community and just one degree of separation from living in their world			1
my twin brother and i took different paths in life			2
he developed a dependency on drugs and spiraled into a life of crime that led to his incarceration			2
this is why making arrests is still a very difficult part of my job			2
like 99 percent of those in law enforcement , i did not get into this profession to disrupt or end lives ; rather , i want to save the lives of so many people -- like my brother			1
" most police officers do this job because they love the communities they serve			1
we chose to be in a profession where every day you get to make a difference , whether it 's saving a child from an unhealthy home , coming to the aid of a domestic violence victim , finding shelter for the homeless or getting a reckless drunken driver off the road			2
" contrary to what many believe , we do not hope to have violent run - ins			0
it is actually what i dread the most			0
" in the piece , i decided not to give my full name			0
i did n't know what type of reaction or backlash to expect			0
for me , submitting this was not without risk			0
i feared being ostracized in the profession i chose , especially by the community i was born into and love			1
as expected , the post did receive a number of negative comments , which i wo n't give attention to because solutions rarely come from negativity			0
one thing that was abundantly clear from reading the reactions was how much television and movies have overtaken reality			0
there was an all too common perception that within every agency , there is a rogue , a power - hungry officer who would violate any policy in his attempt to destroy the black community			1
one commenter said it best , " bigoted bad guys do n't just stick out like in movies twirling their mustaches and looking evil			0
" a few asked why i chose to single out black protesters when those involved in the movement are from all races			1
to that i say , while this is a national discussion , i believe the solutions are primarily local			0
i spoke to those who are part of our black communities and encouraged them to form relationships with local law enforcement and work with them to recruit more diverse police officers			1
i was pleasantly surprised by how many of the readers welcomed this encouragement			0
these are some of the voices from our community that the media often fails to represent			1
" as an @entity11 teacher in the @entity11 public school system , i can identify with his words			1
i know what it is like to do a thankless job and to be misunderstood and undervalued both when my professional uniform is on and off			0
a huge shift would come if people of color decided to take jobs in law enforcement and teaching			0
" " @entity161 , i was proud that a black man and officer spoke up about it			1
it needed to be said			0
it was the truth of how @entity11 act and respond in these situations			1
" but nothing was more gratifying than to hear the words of encouragement i received from fellow black officers representing various police departments throughout the country			1
they were relieved that someone had given them a voice			0
to hear their appreciation was emotionally rewarding			0
while people are protesting and searching for answers , i just hope they also consider there are police officers who are the living embodiment of the very solutions they seek			2
