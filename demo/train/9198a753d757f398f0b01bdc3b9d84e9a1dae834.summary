regardless of their adult weight , men who were obese as teenagers were nearly seven times more likely than their slimmest peers to get heart disease in their mid- 30s , the study found			1
heavier - than - average teens whose body mass index was in the normal range were at increased risk as well			2
( body mass index , or @entity21 , is a ratio of height to weight that provides a rough estimate of body fat			0
) the good news is that the same was not true of diabetes			0
a man 's @entity21 as an adult , but not as a teen , was linked to an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes , so slimming down by eating right and exercising appears to go a long way toward preventing the onset of the disease , the researchers say			1
@entity0 : 10 signs of type 2 diabetes " for those who do n't become obese as adults , the risk of diabetes goes down , but for heart disease this is not the case , " says the lead author of the study , @entity43 , @entity44 , an endocrinologist at @entity45 , in @entity46 , @entity47			1
" you do n't get rid of the risk just by reducing the weight			0
the body remembers when we were running around with a higher @entity21			0
" current weight and recent weight changes strongly influence the risk of developing type 2 diabetes			1
by contrast , the findings suggest , the narrowing and hardening of the arteries ( atherosclerosis ) that characterizes heart disease and often goes hand in hand with obesity -- both are aggravated by a poor diet and sedentary lifestyle -- is gradual and difficult to reverse , even with weight loss			2

nutrition , exercise , and other lifestyle choices , he says , have a " much greater impact " on risk than body size alone			0
two people with the same @entity21 can have very different risks for diabetes and heart disease if one of them exercises regularly and the other does not , says @entity83 , who was not involved in the new study			1

the @entity115 defines kids and teens with a @entity21 between the 5th and 85th percentile for their age as normal , but @entity43 and his colleagues found that boys with @entity122 as low as the 50th percentile -- which equates to a @entity21 of about 20 -- were at increased risk			1
" for patients at the higher end of the normal range , doctors should be addressing risk factors such as family history of heart disease and smoking , " @entity43 says			2
the study drew on data from the medical records of more than 37,000 @entity137 soldiers who were drafted at age 17 and chose to pursue careers in the military			1
the participants were followed for about 17 years , during which they gained an average of 33 pounds			0

( heart disease was diagnosed with a type of x-ray known as an angiogram ; men qualified if they had at least one coronary artery that had narrowed by 50 percent or more			2
