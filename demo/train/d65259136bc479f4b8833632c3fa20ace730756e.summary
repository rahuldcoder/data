in one photo , a fit , smiling man holds ... plastic flowers			0
in another , three men pose together , all with bouquets			0
that 's not all : the men pose in colorful , patterned pants and in front of equally dazzling backdrops			2
in fact , in picture after picture , the strength of the musclemen is contrasted with the delicacy of the flowers -- a traditional way to show style and taste , according to the artist -- and the boldness of the fabric colors			0
it creates a vibrant , even impish twist on conventional strongman photographs			0
that 's deliberate , says @entity13			0
" @entity18 is all about color -- @entity17 is like a visual assault , " he says in an email on behalf of his client			2

" @entity74 shot in black and white using a 6 x 6 @entity106			0
