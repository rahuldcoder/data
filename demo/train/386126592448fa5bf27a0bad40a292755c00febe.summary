-- last week , @entity1 released its sixth annual supplier responsibility report , which detailed violations made by its suppliers			2
in the same week , news surfaced that about 150 @entity8 workers at a giant manufacturing plant that produces @entity11 's @entity10 had threatened mass suicide by throwing themselves off their factory rooftop amid a labor dispute			1
the incident involving one of @entity1 's chief competitors took place at a @entity20 factory complex in @entity21 , roughly 600 miles from the better - known port city of @entity23			1
@entity25 media outlets carried a haunting photo showing dozens of workers assembled on a rooftop , with several standing at its edge			0
we pluck our favorite phone or game controller off racks at our local electronics store , or they arrive at our doorstep , but in fact , they originate in @entity8 cities like @entity23 and @entity21			0
as a result , labor disputes and injustices on the other side of the world feel far away and difficult to judge			2
journalistic @entity45 © s , along with @entity47 's highly scrutinized one - man play " @entity48 of @entity49 , " have sought to raise awareness of conditions at @entity20 factories in @entity8 in recent months			1
they describe long hours , low wages and overcrowded worker housing units , even if @entity56 reported last may that @entity20 had started making strides under pressure from @entity1			1
still , as we hear stories like the one out of @entity21 last week -- albeit not of @entity1 , but one of its competitors -- there seems to be a collective sense of confusion , helplessness and resignation on the part of consumers			2
the fact that we are overwhelmed is understandable			0
@entity20 is the unimaginably huge , yet virtually unknown producer of the most popular , best - selling gadgets of our time , with an estimated 800,000 employees			2
it manufactures products like @entity75 's @entity74 , @entity76 , @entity11 's @entity77 and @entity79 's @entity78 , among many other consumer electronics			0
but chief among them are @entity1 's @entity83 and @entity84 , which dwarf most others in sales and stature			0
as the unrivaled global technology leader , @entity1 needs to step up its pressure on @entity20 and raise its supply chain standards to remedy labor injustices			1
we consumers need to stand with them ; we 've done it before			0
just look at the sweatshop movement in the 1990s			0
the @entity95 created a media frenzy over the child labor that was used to create @entity100 's @entity99 label , effectively ending it			0
on a larger scale , the @entity101 all but eradicated products that were created by exploitative labor for sale on campuses , simply by raising awareness among students and demanding more from manufacturing standards			0
in recent days , students at @entity113 , @entity1 ceo @entity111 's alma mater , published an open letter calling on @entity111 and @entity1 to guarantee " conflict - free " products			1
in releasing @entity1 's supplier responsibility report , @entity111 is acknowledging @entity1 's role , and in an internal memo to @entity1 staff , he said , " no one in our industry is driving improvements for workers the way @entity1 is today			1
" we , as consumers , have to embrace our own responsibility to the workers who labor over our coveted gadgets by keeping pressure on @entity1 and its competitors to ensure that they will change their ways			1
with injuries and suicides at @entity20 's manufacturing facilities already documented , lives are literally on the line			0
we can start by demanding that @entity1 and other companies that use suppliers like @entity20 provide a safe and healthy work environment for their employees			2
if @entity20 can deliver on @entity1 's extraordinary product and packaging demands , it certainly has the ability to make this happen			1
scores of @entity8 workers have stood up under desperate , if not oppressive , circumstances by one of @entity1 's foremost competitors , probably just trying to keep up			1
while @entity154 and others remain intent on associating @entity1 's late founder with the company 's poor labor practices , this can and should be @entity111 's defining moment			1
after all , before being anointed ceo , @entity111 was the supply chain guru behind @entity1 's remarkable rebirth and success			1
but this is n't just on @entity111 or @entity1 ; it 's on all of us			2

consumers need to pressure @entity1 to improve its supply - side standards , he says
he says this is ceo @entity111 's moment to fix the labor injustices associated with @entity1 products
