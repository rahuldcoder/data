@entity0 -- @entity4 leaders privately agreed to accept a very limited return of the 6 million @entity4 refugees and their descendants to previous homes in what is now @entity10 , leaked documents showed tuesday			1
the leaked documents dealing with the sensitive issue of the " right of return " for @entity4 refugees comes a day after the @entity16 news network @entity15 began releasing documents revealing details of @entity10 - @entity4 peace negotiations			1
the leaks have prompted protests and outrage in the @entity23 and @entity24			2
according to the minutes of a meeting in january 2010 @entity4 chief negotiator @entity26 told @entity28 official @entity27 that the @entity4 had accepted a " symbolic number " of refugees returning to @entity10			1
in minutes from a meeting the year before with his own negotiating team @entity26 said that the former @entity10 prime minister @entity33 had accepted the return of a 1,000 refugees annually for a period of ten years			1
speaking to negotiators in 2009 @entity39 president @entity38 said , " on numbers of refugees it is illogical to ask @entity10 to take 5 million or indeed 1 million -- that would mean the end of @entity10			2
" the " right of return " is a highly sensitive topic for both @entity4 and @entity10 and remains one of the core sticking points in achieving a peace deal			1
any concession on the issue of refugees by either side poses huge difficulties with their political constituencies			2
for most @entity4 the eventual return to their former homes in what is now @entity10 remains a fundamental requirement while @entity10 argue that the large - scale return of refugees would spell the end of the @entity63 majority state			1
complicating matters for the @entity39 in dealing with the issue of refugees return are comments attributed to @entity26 from the minutes of a 2007 meeting with the @entity70 foreign minister @entity69 in which the chief @entity4 negotiator suggested that refugees would not have the right to vote on a peace deal			1
" i never said the @entity76 will vote			0
it 's not going to happen			0
the referendum will be for @entity4 in @entity24 , the @entity23 and @entity0			2
ca n't do it in @entity80			0
ca n't do it in @entity82			0
" in a statement monday , @entity26 said that " a number of reports have surfaced regarding our positions in our negotiations with @entity10 , many of which have misrepresented our positions , taking statements and facts out of context			1
other allegations circulated in the media have been patently false			0
" he added , " our position has been the same for the past 19 years of negotiations : we seek to establish a sovereign and independent @entity4 state along the 1967 borders with @entity0 as its capital and to reach a just solution to the refugee issue based on their international legal rights " , adding any proposed agreement " would have to gain popular support through a national referendum			1
" other revelations from the second day of leaked document include : -- the suggestion by then secretary of state @entity111 in a 2008 tri-lateral meeting with @entity10 and @entity4 officials that refugees could be sent to outside countries such as @entity116 and @entity117 ; -- the suggestion in 2008 meetings by then @entity10 foreign minister @entity120 that future land swaps should include @entity10 @entity16 villages ; -- the refusal of the @entity125 @entity124 to accept a @entity127 administration decision to use 1967 borders as a baseline for negotiations between @entity10 and @entity4 about any proposed land swap agreement			1
on sunday @entity15 began its release of over 1,600 documents dubbed " the @entity134			0
" the first release of papers suggested that @entity4 negotiators offered to give up large swaths of @entity0 to @entity10 during negotiations dating back to 2008 and that they had been willing to offer much larger concessions in private than they were acknowledging public			1
the leaked papers brought a furious reaction form @entity39 officials with president @entity38 calling the release " shameful			0
" " the report aired by @entity15 is an intentional mixing between the many @entity10 proposals and the @entity4 positions , " @entity38 said in @entity147 , @entity148 , in comments published by the @entity4 news agency @entity150			1
@entity155 , a senior @entity38 adviser went further , accusing @entity15 of a " smear campaign			0
" " what happened is a manipulation of the documents and a misrepresentation of the facts and a true distortion , just for mockery and defiance , " @entity155 told reporters			0
contacted by @entity1 , @entity15 declined to comment on the criticisms from the @entity39			0
dozens of @entity4 gathered monday in central @entity168 , burning banners for @entity15 and holding posters comparing the channel to @entity10			2
several demonstrators also attempted to storm the offices of the @entity15 office but were turned back by @entity4 police personnel			0
@entity28 spokesman @entity176 refused to comment on any of the specific documents , but told reporters that their release complicated the efforts to get @entity10 and @entity4 back to the negotiating table			1
" we do n't deny that this release will , at least for a time , make the situation more difficult than it already was , " @entity176 said			0
" we continue to believe that a framework agreement is both possible and necessary			0
" the papers , some of which were posted on the @entity15 's website , shed new light on the details of the @entity10 - @entity4 conflict from 1999 through last year			2
@entity1 could not immediately verifiy the documents .			0

new documents show @entity4 leaders agreed to accept a " symbolic " return of @entity4 refugees to @entity10
the " right of return " is a very sensitive issue for @entity4
the leaked documents , which have prompted outrage , cover negotiations over a number of years
