-- @entity2 's immigration law , @entity1 , has generated a lot of ink recently , especially with a court ruling last week that allowed a controversial provision that in my view will result in racial profiling to move forward			1
the law 's goal is chilling : ramp up deportations of undocumented people by forcing local police into the difficult role of immigration agents			1
and with last week 's ruling , police are now required to go out of their way to investigate the immigration status of everyone they " suspect " might be undocumented whom they arrest or stop			1
in practice , that will mean targeting people just for the way they look or speak , separating families , and trapping undocumented people in local jails for minor infractions to await deportation			1
as an undocumented @entity34 -- and i am , in my heart , an @entity34 -- it is my hope that our nation does n't follow @entity2 's discriminatory example			2
will @entity2 become the norm , or can we work as a nation to fix dysfunctional immigration policies so that they reflect our best values as @entity34 ? all eyes are now on @entity47 for a key part of the answer			2
sitting on the gov. @entity51 's desk is the most important piece of legislation for immigrant communities this year			1
by signing the bill , called the @entity56 , @entity51 can prevent the separation of thousands of families , establish an alternative to @entity2 's approach and send a powerful message to the nation : in a state built and replenished by generations of immigrants , fairness and equality matter			1
under the @entity56 , local law enforcement would only be able to hold people for extra time , for deportation purposes , if the person has been convicted of , or charged with , a serious or violent felony			1
with the @entity56 , @entity74 , the " tamale lady , " never would have been stuck in @entity76 for 13 days on an immigration hold after the most absurd of arrests			0
with the @entity56 , @entity80 ' children would n't have spent weeks worrying if they would ever see their mother again			0
if @entity51 signs the bill , he will bring hope to millions of undocumented @entity34 like me , and some relief to our family members who fear that if we are arrested for even the most trivial of charges , they will never see us again			2
undocumented people and their allies -- their relatives and friends , their neighbors and co-workers -- have created a new political climate in which the passage of the @entity56 is not simply the right thing to do , but the politically strategic thing to do , with supporters from across the political spectrum , from @entity104 to right - leaning think tanks such as the @entity106 and @entity107			0
the enactment of @entity56 would also help turn the page on a painful era of our state 's history that the implementation of the @entity2 law evokes			0
a year after i arrived in this country at the age of 12 , four years before i knew about my own undocumented status , i watched with anxiety as @entity47 voters passed @entity121			0
that ballot initiative , in many ways , was the precursor to @entity1 and @entity125 , @entity2 's and @entity127 's " show - me - your - papers " laws , respectively			0
although courts would ultimately reject @entity121 , fear immediately gripped immigrants in @entity47 upon its passage in 1994			2
the specter of local police acting as immigration agents was one of the measure 's most unsettling provisions			0
and despite how much @entity47 has changed in nearly two decades , the federal @entity139 deportation program , which was supposed to target people " convicted of serious criminal offenses , " has instead effectively done what @entity121 's backers tried to do -- turn local law enforcement into de facto immigration authorities			1
what if while driving from my alma mater , @entity145 , down to my hometown of @entity147 , i were stopped for the most minor traffic infraction ? or , perhaps , simply profiled ? i could be detained for driving without a valid license			0
then , under " @entity139 , " my fingerprints would be sent to @entity152 no matter how minor the charge			0
@entity152 would then ask the jail to hold me for extra time , at local expense , until it came to pick me up for deportation as my grandmother , a naturalized @entity34 citizen , waited for me at home in @entity147			2
this is essentially what 's happened to about 80,000 @entity47 who have quietly been torn from their families under the ridiculously named federal deportation program , " @entity139			1
" seven out of 10 people detained nationally under @entity139 either had no convictions or committed minor offenses , according to @entity152 statistics			2
and even though top law professors have confirmed that requests to detain immigrants for additional time are " optional , " many @entity47 jurisdictions have submitted , no matter the damage done to community - police relations			1
enter the @entity56 , which limits responses to @entity152 's requests to detain people in local jails for additional time for deportation purposes			1
it should not be lost on anyone that the bill 's author is @entity184 assemblyman @entity183 , who was @entity185 's first openly gay teacher			0
@entity183 fought for equality alongside @entity187 in the 1970s			0
as a gay man myself , i see many parallels in the history of the lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender and immigrant communities ' fights for inclusion			0
@entity51 's signing of the @entity56 would be a watershed moment in the long journey toward permanent reform to recognize our common humanity			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity207 .			0

@entity207 : law awaiting gov. @entity51 's action important for immigrants
he says it would stop practice of police holding *nonviolent* *offenders* for deportation by @entity152
@entity207 says 80,000 people in @entity47 have been deported ; vast *majority* are n't criminals
