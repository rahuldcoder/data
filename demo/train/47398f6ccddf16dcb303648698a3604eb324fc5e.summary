" we will work closely with regulators , health officials and our customers in bringing back the products			0
" no one has reported getting sick from eating the vegetables , according to @entity17			2

the company 's products are sold retail as well as to wholesalers , who may then distribute them to restaurants and other establishments , according to @entity69 , a public relations consultant for the company			0

a complete listing of the other recalled produce will be available on the company 's website			2
after the positive results , regulators and health officials in the @entity14 and @entity15 have stepped up inspections of @entity17 's facilities , @entity42 said			1
they also undertook other measures , including stopping and sanitizing all production lines , adding manual inspections , rinsing products more and bringing in consultants			0
" we have a good track record , but we 'll bring our expectations and standards to even higher levels , " he said			0
" we 've already begun improving our systems			0

a separate salmonella outbreak linked to alfalfa sprouts has sickened some 94 people in 16 states and the @entity88 , the @entity139 reported tuesday			1
health officials said those first cases became known november 1 , with many getting ill after eating alfalfa sprouts in products from @entity144 outlets			1
the @entity146 said monday that those vegetables came from @entity148			1
@entity150 's alfalfa sprouts and spicy sprouts , which have alfalfa sprouts plus radish and clover sprouts , were distributed in 4 - ounce and 5 - pound containers to farmers ' markets , grocery stores and restaurants including @entity144 's			1

in a letter to @entity144 's franchisees , founder @entity144 said that the chain had pulled sprouts from all its @entity94 establishments after store locations came up negative for the bacteria			2
about 24 % of those sickened in that outbreak were hospitalized , the @entity139 said			2
no deaths have been linked to the outbreak			0
the @entity146 said monday that the sprouts were distributed in @entity188 , @entity189 , @entity82 and possibly other midwestern states , with roughly half the illnesses occurring in @entity94			1
health officials had previously said the salmonella outbreak had sickened at least 89 people in 15 states and the @entity88			2

those who get it typically develop fever , abdominal cramps and diarrhea between 12 and 72 hours after becoming infected			0
