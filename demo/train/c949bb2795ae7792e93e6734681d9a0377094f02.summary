@entity4 the father of a 27 - year - old man shot dead by an @entity3 agent said thursday that accounts he has heard about the killing make no sense			2
@entity8 was fatally shot early may 22 during questioning about a 2011 triple homicide in @entity10 , @entity11 , as well as his relationship with deceased @entity14 bombings suspect @entity15			1
@entity8 admitted to his direct role in slashing three people 's throats in @entity10 and said @entity15 was involved as well , a federal law enforcement official told @entity5			1
it was during that interview -- which took place in the kitchen of his @entity25 , @entity26 , home -- that @entity8 was shot dead			1
" my son was definitely unarmed , because he never had a gun , " his father @entity28 told @entity5 in @entity4			1
" he could n't attack them or fight them ; he could n't do anything because even two men could easily handle him			1
" contrary to what a @entity37 official said , @entity8 's father claimed there were " four of five " law enforcement agents with his son at the time , " all armed			1
" " he did n't pose any threat to them			2
but even if he threatened them with his fists , could n't they shoot his leg ? " @entity28 said			2
" my son could n't attack them			1
" addressing reporters on thursday , @entity28 added his son had recently undergone leg surgery and needed crutches to walk			2
group seeks investigation into @entity8 's death photographs of his son 's body show that he was shot seven times , once to the head , said @entity28			1
" they were torturing the man for eight hours			0
there was no lawyer , no witnesses , nobody			0
until we get the results of the official investigation , we can only guess what was going on there			2
" the elder @entity8 suggested his son may have been provoked			1
" if you question someone for eight hours , you can provoke him into anything , " he said			0
the father said he had spent much of his life raising his 12 children , and that he knew @entity76 well			2
" i know what he is capable and not capable of			0
my son could not have done this			2
" official : @entity15 involved in 2011 slayings a @entity37 government official briefed on the investigation said thursday that @entity83 had agreed to talk to authorities , and noted that he was never arrested or handcuffed			1
a samurai sword was in the room when @entity8 sat down with two @entity88 detectives and a @entity90 - based @entity3 agent , but it was moved out of his reach			1
after one of the detectives left the room , the other noticed @entity83 was acting odd and he texted that sense to the @entity3 agent with him -- the @entity37 official told @entity5			1
those two law enforcement officials were the only ones with @entity83 , according to this account			0
suddenly , @entity83 knocked over a table -- knocking the @entity3 agent back into a wall -- and came at him with some sort of " long - handled object " that he 'd grabbed from behind him , according to the official			1
the agent fired a few rounds , but @entity83 kept on coming , the official said			0
he finally stopped after yet more gunshots			0
" it all happened in less than a minute , " said the @entity37 official			1
a law enforcement official told @entity5 on friday that @entity83 attacked the @entity3 agent with a broom handle , not a sword			0
" he ( @entity83 ) took a whack at his ( the agent 's ) head , and he got a pretty good gash			0
" the official said that investigators knew going into the questioning that @entity8 was proficient in mixed martial arts			1
the official stressed that the shooting was justified and done in self - defense because the agent felt threatened			0
the description of what allegedly happened -- as well as the comments from the elder @entity8 -- come a day after @entity5 affiliate @entity128 and the @entity129 , citing unidentified sources , reported @entity8 was unarmed when he was shot			2
that led the @entity26 chapter of the @entity132 to call wednesday for an investigation into the death of the @entity136 man			0
" our call for an independent investigation of this disturbing incident is not just about the victim and his family , but is also about constitutional rights and the rule of law , " said @entity138 executive director @entity137			0
but the @entity37 government official briefed on the investigation rebuffed the idea that @entity83 was n't a threat -- noting , for instance , that he could have taken the agent 's gun			1
maybe it was n't a weapon , but he had a long object , " the official said			2
and because of @entity83 's martial arts expertise , " he was a weapon himself			0
" an @entity3 spokesman earlier said the agent sustained " non-life - threatening injuries " in the incident			0
the @entity37 official elaborated that the agent received treatment for lacerations			1
@entity28 said he planned to fly " hopefully " friday to the @entity37 to bring " my son 's body back to his homeland and bury him here			1
" " ( he was ) a regular , funny boy ( who ) loved his brothers and sisters , " the father said			0
" he wanted to stay ( in the @entity37 and @entity176 ) said it was a nice place to train and to live			2
i said he should stay there			0
" former @entity181 rebel : ' i have nothing to do with ' @entity90 bombings the @entity3 opened an investigation into the incident after the killing -- standard procedure in any shooting that involves an agent			2
" while this internal review process is occurring , we can not comment regarding investigative details , " @entity3 spokesman @entity190 said wednesday			0
" the @entity3 takes very seriously any shooting incidents involving our agents and as such we have an effective , time - tested process for addressing them internally			0
the review process is thorough and objective and conducted as expeditiously as possible under the circumstances			0
" @entity83 and @entity15 had become acquainted at a mixed martial arts center near @entity90 , said a source who was briefed on the bombing investigation			1
@entity8 had @entity15 's phone number in his cell phone , the source said			1
@entity8 was from the @entity181 region , as were @entity15 and @entity207 , the source said			2
@entity208 , @entity15 's brother , is a suspect in the april bombings in @entity90			1
@entity28 does n't believe his son admitted to any involvement in the @entity10 triple homicide , saying " the @entity3 can say anything now because a dead person ca n't defend himself			1
" that said , the father said he believes " there are lots of honest workers " in @entity37 law enforcement who he thinks " can be trusted ( to ) conduct a fair investigation " into his son 's death			1
" i do want justice , " @entity28 told @entity5			0
" i 've always taught my children about justice			0
i do believe in it			0
" @entity5 's @entity229 reported from @entity4 , and @entity230 reported from @entity231			0
@entity5 's @entity232 and @entity233 contributed to this report .			0
