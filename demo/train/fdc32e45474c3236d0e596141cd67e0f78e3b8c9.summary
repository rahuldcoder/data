ready to rip apart that dirty restaurant with the rude service , strange - looking patty melts and lukewarm coffee ? @entity5 lawmakers want to make sure you do n't get in financial , or legal , trouble because of it			1
a state law signed this week by gov. @entity10 makes @entity11 reviews a lot safer , saying that restaurants ca n't pursue legal action for customers who give them negative reviews			1
the digital - age legislation appears to be the first of its kind			0
it addresses so - called " disparagement clauses , " lines included in businesses ' terms of service that prohibit customers from posting negative comments about the service they received			0
the new law bans such clauses			1
it would fine any business that tries to enforce one $ 2,500 the first time and $ 5,000 every time after that , with another $ 10,000 added if the action is considered " willful , intentional or reckless			2
" it seems like a law so ridiculous would never be needed			0
sure , freedom of speech under the @entity41 lets us tell the world that we just had the worst bowl of chili in the world , right ? well , that has n't stopped restaurants and other service - industry spots from trying to go after customers for just that			0

hundreds of people took to @entity11 to complain about the policy and write mostly fake , eviscerating reviews of the hotel			2
" trying to prevent your customers from talking about their experiences is bad policy and , in this case , likely unenforceable anyway , " @entity11 said			2
overseas , a @entity71 blogger was fined the equivalent of about $ 3,200 after a negative review of a restaurant began surfacing prominently in @entity76 searches .			0
