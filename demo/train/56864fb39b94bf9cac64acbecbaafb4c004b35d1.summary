-- @entity1 came up with a way to play back recorded sound in 1878			2
but 20 years before the inventor patented the phonograph , @entity6 scientist @entity4 © on @entity7 was fiddling around in his laboratory trying to come up with a way to record sound			1
his invention , the phonautogram , enabled him to create a visual representation of his voice			2
@entity7 was n't able to listen back to his recordings , though			2
the science of acoustics was in its infancy			2
he could only see lines etched in soot			2
his achievements were long - forgotten until a group of historians , audio engineers and scientists searched for his work			1
the @entity29 found it in the archives of the @entity32 in 2008			2
" his machine would capture the vibrations out of the air and write them on to a moving piece of paper , " said @entity33 , one of the founders of @entity29			0
" when you look at the writing that this machine made , it looks exactly like a sound wave would look on audio editing software today			0
" @entity33 and his group analyzed @entity7 's work with audio software and unlocked the sound held in the waveforms			0
the result is like listening to a ghostly time machine , the voice of a man from 150 years ago singing @entity6 song " @entity56			1
" the earliest known sound recordings can be heard at @entity58			1
@entity33 said recordings like these are extremely important			2
" imagine studying art without being able to actually look at the canvases themselves			0
what modern technology and modern scholarship are opening up is a window into past human endeavors that we can hear through			1
" nearly 20 years after @entity7 experimented with recording his voice in @entity70 , @entity1 perfected a way to record and play back audio at his laboratory in @entity74			2
his invention would spark a new industry , the recording business			0
@entity78 is a historian of early audio recordings			1
his home in @entity81 , @entity82 , is a private museum of sorts , with a collection of recording and playback devices from a century ago			2
chests of drawers are filled with recordings made more than 100 years ago			1
@entity78 is part of a network of historians and audiophiles on a mission to find and preserve the earliest recordings ever made			1
they do this with a sense of urgency			0
the recordings from the late 1800s were made on very fragile cylinders			2
" they were made of a soft kind of wax , " said @entity78			1
" they 're very subject to humidity and mold			0
and if they 're not stored carefully , then you will take them out a few years later and suddenly you ca n't hear anything because the mold has eaten it up			2
" a new window onto history was recently opened up at @entity118 's laboratory in @entity74			0
as the place was undergoing renovations , someone discovered a long - forgotten box containing cylinder recordings of @entity124			1
the influential 19th - century statesman unified @entity126 and preserved peace in @entity128 for more than 40 years			1
the cylinders were n't in the best condition , but they were still listenable			0
through the static , you can hear @entity124 on the @entity133 's website reciting poetry			0
" nobody living today had ever heard the great @entity126 chancellor			0
today we can , " said @entity33			0
" by hearing it , it conveys all sorts of information that may or may not have survived in printed accounts of the man and of his speaking			0
" @entity78 is researching the earliest african - american recordings ever made as well as black spirituals recorded by white performers			1
he wrote extensively about @entity148 , the first @entity149 heavyweight boxing champion			1
in 1910 , he beat a white man in what was called the fight of the century			0
his win sparked deadly race riots across a racially divided country			0
" at that time , he recorded his description of the fight			0
... this recording had been thought lost for years and years and years , " said @entity78			1
" he [ @entity148 ] is usually portrayed as a kind of @entity161 character , a very big living in your face guy in the middle of white @entity166 causing lots of turmoil because he lives so large and makes so many outrageous statements			0
" but the recording reveals a very different @entity148			0
" you can see that he 's like a politician			0
he knows he 's in a dangerous place because he 's a black man in a very racist white @entity149			1
and he 's dealing with it in a way that is playing on the fairness of the game -- may the best man win -- as opposed to the racial aspects of it , " said @entity78			1
" that 's a whole different view of this person than we did get before just from the written word			0
" @entity78 says preserving long - forgotten recordings is important work precisely for that reason			1
" in a way , scholarship has n't caught up yet with the importance of recorded sound and understanding why leaders were able to lead and change history the way they did , " said @entity78			1
" once in a while , if our ears are open and we 're really listening it , can change our understanding of how they were able to do what they did			0
" @entity78 anxiously awaits the next discovery of a long - forgotten recording that will change our view of history			1
in the meantime , he has plenty of wax recordings in his home museum to study and preserve .			1
