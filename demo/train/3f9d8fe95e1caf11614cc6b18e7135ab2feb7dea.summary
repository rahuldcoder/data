for the fifth time this year , @entity0 has flaunted its savagery by posting a video about a westerner 's beheading			1
this time , it was the family of @entity9 hostage @entity7 that received the horrific news			1
but the video that purportedly shows the aftermath of @entity7 's beheading is different from the other videos -- and shows hints of desperation by the terror group , analysts say			1
here are some key points about the latest video and what they could indicate about @entity0 : the actual killing is n't shown the video , released online sunday , shows the aftermath of a beheading , but the victim 's decapitated head is not clearly recognizable			1
the @entity28 confirmed that the video showed @entity7			2
@entity7 , 26 , was a @entity9 soldier who served in @entity30 in 2007			1
he returned to the @entity31 as a medical worker , helping victims caught in @entity35 's civil war			0
that 's when @entity0 captured him			1
@entity7 converted to @entity37 in captivity and also went by the name @entity40			0
the @entity0 video does n't show the actual killing , unlike previous videos			1
but it does show -- in gruesome detail -- the beheadings of what the group claims are pilots for the @entity35 government , which is also battling @entity0 forces			1
" it ca n't be said enough , " said @entity53 's @entity52			0
" this is the most barbaric they 've done so far			0
" the production is more basic unlike the glossy productions of the past , the latest footage appears to be more hastily produced , @entity53 national security analyst @entity57 said			0
" i think what this tape indicates is these guys are on the run , " said @entity57 , a former @entity60 analyst			0
" they did n't have time to do a nice setup ( with ) a lot of production values			0
i think they know they 're being targeted			0
there 's a lot of @entity9 platforms in the area looking for the hostages , so i think they 're trying to beat those			1
" and for the first time in such a video , the speaker names the place where he is standing with the victim -- in the town of @entity84 in @entity86 province , @entity35			0
there was no threat of another beheading in each of the previous beheading videos , an @entity0 militant shows another westerner who it says will be next to be killed			2
and each time , it has followed through on its threat			0
in the latest video , @entity0 did not show images of another westerner targeted for beheading			1
but that does n't mean @entity102 are spared from more killings , said @entity104 of the anti-extremist think tank @entity106			0
" as we see the @entity9 and the coalition making gains against @entity0 , we will find that they try and show that they are still strong , try and show that they are just as barbaric as they have been , and unfortunately one of the things we 'll see is that the videos will become more and more barbaric , " @entity104 said			1
@entity0 is another acronym for @entity0 , which calls itself the @entity117			2
" i think it 's a sign of desperation , " he said			0
" i think it 's a sign that they know and feel they are under attack , they 're under siege and they 're struggling			0
" yet after almost 900 airstrikes by @entity9 - led coalition forces , @entity0 is still operating and has shown it is still killing @entity102			1
" i think until we really deal with the political problems in that part of the world , the airstrikes will only go so far			0
" the video could also be directed at @entity35 and @entity30 the video is clearly " a prize piece of propaganda for them , " @entity52 said			0
it is likely also meant to scare @entity35 and @entity30 into obeying @entity0 ' orders when it comes calling , said retired @entity143 lt. col. @entity142 , a counterterrorism expert			2
" what @entity0 is telling them is , ' when we come in and tell you to do what we tell you , you know what the consequences are if you say no , ' " @entity142 said			2
but it also comes at a time when the @entity9 and its anti-isis allies are claiming their airstrikes and support for ground forces fighting the group are beginning to slowly turn the tide , said retired @entity9 maj. gen. @entity160			1
" clearly there are no coincidences , " @entity162 told @entity53 on sunday			2
" this is timed very specifically to those activities by the coalition and , i would say , the results of those activities			2
" has @entity0 peaked ? terror group suffers setbacks in @entity30 the @entity9 says it is making progress since beginning airstrikes in august , @entity9 officials have touted successes in disrupting @entity0 communications and logistics , slowing its advances and forcing fighters to disperse into smaller formations			1
earlier this month , president @entity180 said the fight was entering a new phase that would rely heavily on @entity30 ground troops and other local fighters			0
more recently , @entity9 officials have suggested more openness to a role for @entity9 ground forces in the fight			2
@entity190 chairman gen. @entity189 testified last week that commanders are " certainly considering " the prospect that @entity9 forces might be needed to retake the @entity30 city of @entity195 , currently held by @entity0			1
in the latest @entity0 video , the narrator taunted @entity180 to do just that			1

analysts say the latest video is aimed partly at local residents
some say the video suggests @entity0 is feeling the sting of @entity9 and coalition airstrikes
@entity162 : the video 's release was timed to counter coalition claims that it 's make strides against @entity0
