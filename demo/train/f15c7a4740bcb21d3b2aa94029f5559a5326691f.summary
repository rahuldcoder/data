court proceedings against the five men wrapped up monday and are scheduled to resume july 25			0
they face charges of public insult against the president of the @entity3 and other top officials , the groups said in a statement			1
all five defendants have pleaded not guilty			1
the four groups jointly calling for charges to be dropped are @entity17 , the @entity18 ( @entity18 ) , @entity19 and @entity20			2
the groups accuse @entity3 authorities of misusing the defamation charges " as a pretext " to punish the activists for peacefully expressing their opinions , they said in a statement			1
" we consider all five men prisoners of conscience and call on the @entity3 authorities to release them unconditionally , " said @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity32 deputy director at @entity17			1
other charges against the men , who police detained in april , include undermining the public order and opposing the government system			2
they have been " held in preventative custody , " according to @entity3 's state news agency @entity43			2
the best - known of the five activists on trial is @entity46 , more commonly known as @entity46			0

on trial with him are economist @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 -- all of the @entity3 -- and @entity63 , who " does not carry identification papers , " state news reported			2
all were arrested on the heels of a recent decision by the @entity3 's government to dissolve the elected board of directors of the @entity70 , a prominent civil rights organization in that country , and replace it with state appointees , according to @entity20			1
the @entity70 was one of four nongovernmental organizations that sent a petition in march 2011 to @entity3 president @entity76 and other authorities asking for direct elections			1
@entity46 signed the petition , which also demanded authorities turn over legislative powers to a representative body known as the @entity83 , which exercises an advisory function			0
@entity83 elections are scheduled for september , according to state media			0
authorities justified the sacking of the association 's elected board , saying it had violated a law banning nongovernmental organizations from interfering " in politics or in matters that impair state security and ( the ) ruling regime			0
" @entity20 has accused @entity3 authorities of acting against its own free speech guarantees as well as those propagated by regional and international provisions			1
the @entity3 are " reacting to domestic criticisms by banning websites , detaining peaceful activists and intensifying its chokehold on civil society , " @entity20 claims			1
the country has not faced street protests , but authorities are sensitive to the unrest sweeping the @entity111 world			1
long - standing regimes in @entity113 and @entity114 were toppled earlier this year , and @entity115 has launched a violent crackdown against protesters in @entity118			0
