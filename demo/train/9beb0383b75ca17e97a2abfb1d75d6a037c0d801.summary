-- @entity1 would like to thank a man he never met			1
the man 's name was @entity5 , and he was a member of the editorial department at @entity7			1
he loved musicals and @entity9 , and was primed to like " at @entity12 , " @entity11 - infused musical			1
after the 1975 film flopped , @entity5 quietly decided to recut it			1
" obviously he took one look at what we 'd done and said , ' these guys are screwing up the movie			1
i 'm going to fix it			2
' and he was right , " says @entity1 in an interview			1
" and he took his time and did it right and saved the movie from the garbage can			1
" the film is now out on blu - ray			1
@entity1 , who 's preparing a new film produced by @entity32 and @entity33 , took a few minutes to talk to @entity0 about " at @entity12 , " the value of previews and his thoughts on today 's @entity37			1
the following is an edited version of the conversation			2
@entity0 : tell me how " @entity42 " came to be			2
@entity1 : i was reading through ( a @entity9 book ) @entity44 ( @entity45 , his then partner ) gave me , and enjoying the lyrics , and thought maybe i should write a musical based on these lyrics			1
and then i read one of the songs , a very unfamiliar song and not a very famous one , called " i loved him ( but he did n't @entity53 )			2
" it sort of gave me the idea for the whole picture			2
@entity0 : @entity57 was unusual casting			2
@entity1 : i did n't have @entity57 in mind			1
i was thinking of @entity60 , who was a song and dance man , and then @entity63 became @entity57 ' agent , and she was my agent , and she said , " why do n't you use @entity57 ? " so i met with him and i liked him , and i figured we 'll try him , he 's a big star , and i thought he would be charming			1
@entity57 could do anything -- he was very talented			2
he was limited by his action - hero persona			2
i remember when we made " @entity70 , " he had a scene with a rifle and the first take was a little macho			2
i said , " can we do it a little less @entity57 ? " he laughed			2
@entity0 : when you were making " at @entity12 , " were you worried about the timing was off ? the mid- ' 70s was an era full of dark pictures			1
@entity1 : i guess i did n't give a s * * *			1
i had purposely made " @entity91 " as a g - rated comedy , and that was in ' 72 , and they asked me when we were making it are you sure you do n't want to make it a @entity89 ? i said no , i want to make it for the whole family -- a g - rated comedy with no socially redeeming value			0
and they all laughed and left me alone , and that was the biggest success of my career			1
so i thought a musical with a similar light touch would be welcome , but i did n't realize how difficult it is to find the right balance between singing and talking , which is the key to it			0
putting @entity37 's biggest bombs back together @entity0 : did the reviews sting ? @entity1 : i did n't read all the nasty reviews			1
the thing is , before the picture opened , the critic @entity112 -- she was a friend -- called me up and said , " how is the picture ? " i said , " pretty good , i think			0
" she said , " it better be good			0
they 're waiting for you with the knives out			0
" and she was in the critical establishment -- she knew from which she spoke			0
we showed them the worst version that existed			0
( the film ) began with @entity44 , which was the worst thing to begin with , because they hated her and me particularly			1
that was the period when you could n't open a newspaper or magazine without seeing some nasty crack about us			0
@entity133 , who was a friend , called me and said , " @entity1 , for @entity134 , stop telling people you 're happy , and stop telling them you 're in looooove			1
" " why , @entity139 ? " " ' cause they 're not happy , and they 're not in love			0
" " i thought all the world loves a lover ? " " @entity145 , do n't you believe it			0
" so that was the climate at that point			0
the picture was killed , except for people such as @entity151 , who liked it to a degree , and the @entity155 critic , who liked it to a degree			0
@entity158 told me years later that , " i saw that picture at the ( @entity161 ) @entity162 three or four times			0
" i said , " s * * * , @entity158 , i wish you 'd told me that then			0
" nobody was more surprised than i was when i saw it streaming on @entity167 and i thought , " this is good			0
" you can get too close to a picture			0
we needed to put it in front of audiences -- it would have taken five or six previews and we would have gotten it right			0
we only had two previews , which is ridiculous for a musical			0
@entity0 : did you find previews helpful ? @entity1 : i had very interesting experiences			1
" @entity188 " was at one of those places where the audience was told to turn a knob one way if they like it and another if they do n't			1
and the picture was not liked at all			0
@entity190 turned to me and said , " what do we do ? " i said , " i think they need to be told it 's a good picture			1
" and they snapped their fingers and said , " tastemaker screenings			0
" so we had 30 screenings for small groups of people and the buzz was extraordinary			0
we previewed " @entity91 " in @entity202 and it was a spectacular success			0
we previewed " @entity205 " in @entity202 and it played perfectly			1
we did n't preview " @entity206			0
" and we did preview " at @entity12 , " and you know the results of that			1
i was told by people i trusted to take things out that really damaged the picture			0
@entity0 : what do you think of @entity37 these days ? does the tentpole mentality concern you ? @entity1 : it 's crazy			1
when @entity220 was making " titanic , " everybody was ( saying ) it 's going to be a big flop , @entity220 's folly			1
i said , if that picture 's a hit , we 're in real trouble			2
and sure enough , it was a hit			0
and sure enough ( budgets skyrocketed )			0
spend $ 150 million ! spend $ 200 million ! and that 's where we are today .			2
