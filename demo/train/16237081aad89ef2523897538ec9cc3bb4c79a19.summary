@entity1 a row has erupted over allegations by representatives of @entity1 's @entity6 community that they were locked into the former @entity8 concentration camp in @entity9 and treated " like real criminals " after filming a tv interview			1
@entity1 's jewish community spokesman @entity12 said on @entity13 that he and the head of @entity1 's @entity6 community , @entity14 , had been filming with a tv crew from @entity17 's @entity16 following a ceremony tuesday to mark 70 years since the camp 's liberation			1
the crew had finished their work at 11 p.m. , and the group tried to leave , he said			2
but group members found they were locked in the camp in subzero temperatures with no security guards in sight			1
" @entity14 then pushed through a window that was in the ticket sales building , and the window opened up , " @entity12 said			2
" he entered and then opened the door for us			0
at that point , the alarm went off			0
and we thought , ' good , finally someone from security will come to let us out			2
' " however , at this point , their night got worse , @entity12 said			0
" the security guard arrived indeed , but instead of letting us go , they kept us there			2
for hours , and hours and hours			2
they started to interrogate us and they treated us like real criminals , " he said			1
@entity12 said the guards were inflexible and insisted on following procedure			0
eventually , they took the party to the @entity8 police station , he said , where they were kept until 5:30 a.m. and questioned one by one			1
" they do n't know how to distinguish between the real criminals and those who were there simply to do an interview and honor the @entity57 , " he said			0
the incident ended with the party writing down their version of events , @entity12 said , adding that they had asked for the matter to be looked into through @entity17 diplomatic channels			0
a spokesman for the @entity8 museum gave @entity2 a different account of the evening 's events , however			1
@entity69 said the @entity17 tv crew had permission to film at the site until 11.30 p.m. , when they had agreed that they would exit and security guards would come to the gate to let them out			1
he said @entity79 footage shows they finished early and went to the gate a few minutes past 11 p.m. rather than waiting for the security guards to come at the agreed time , one of them broke into the visitor center and let others in , too , he said			1
this triggered an alarm , so the security guards came to the building , which houses cash registers and an atm			1
according to protocol , they asked the men to show @entity96 , but they refused to do so , @entity69 said			0
the police had to be called since they can only demand that people show @entity96 documents , he said			0
the police then arrived and took over the matter , he said			0
" while being on the site , we have to follow the rules , " @entity69 said			0
" so until the unfortunate incident , everything was ok because they had our permission , they cooperated with our security and they had the time that they declared they would be leaving			0
" he said the group could also have gone to another exit 150 meters ( nearly 500 feet ) away where the security guards were based if they wanted to leave earlier -- and could then have been let out of that gate			1
" however , they decided to act outside the regulations and triggered the security alarm and triggered the whole reaction and then refused to cooperate			1
" @entity8 is a " priceless heritage place , " he said			2
" it must be protected and there must be security			0
" @entity2 's @entity126 wrote and reported from @entity127 and @entity128 from @entity1 .			1

@entity1 's @entity131 spokesman says they were treated like criminals at @entity8
he says they were interrogated for hours by security guards and police after being locked in
@entity8 spokesman says the group broke into a building and then refused to cooperate
