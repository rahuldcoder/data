@entity0 -- @entity2 neared hurricane strength monday night , closing on the @entity4 with a projected landfall a day short of the seventh anniversary of the devastating @entity7			1
@entity2 was forecast to strike land south of @entity0 on tuesday night , perhaps as a category 1 hurricane with top winds of about 90 mph			1
the @entity12 anniversary was leaving much of the @entity4 with " a high level of anxiety , " as @entity0 mayor @entity15 put it monday			1
residents of low - lying coastal areas from the @entity19 to southeastern @entity20 were ordered to evacuate ahead of storm surges and heavy rain , while @entity15 acknowledged his own jitters due to the coincidence			1
@entity2 is expected to be weaker than @entity7 , which came ashore as a category 3 hurricane with 125 - mph winds			1
but @entity0 could start to feel tropical storm force winds by midnight monday , and while @entity2 may veer off its currently projected course , " it seems to be settling into a pathway and a speed that is becoming predictable , " @entity15 said			1
" it is quite ironic that we have a hurricane threatening us on the seventh anniversary of @entity7 , " he said			2
but he added that as of monday afternoon , " there is nothing this storm will bring us that we are not capable of handling			2
" most of @entity7 's nearly 1,800 deaths occurred when the protective levees around @entity0 failed , flooding the city			1
but @entity15 said the levees have had $ 10 billion in improvements since 2005 , and the city 's pump stations have backup generators ready in case of electrical outages			0
one of those stations is the biggest in the world and some can move as much as 150,000 gallons per second			0
" this is the best system that the greater @entity0 area has ever seen , " col. @entity52 of the @entity53 said			1
preparing for @entity2 , state by state @entity2 faltered a bit in the @entity61 as an eye wall that had been forming appeared to break up monday afternoon , slowing its development , @entity59 deputy director @entity58 told @entity1			1
as of 11 p.m. et , its top winds remained 70 mph -- just under hurricane strength -- and it was expected to become a hurricane " monday night or early tuesday , " the @entity65 - based hurricane center reported			1
@entity2 was centered about 190 miles ( 305 kilometers ) southeast of the mouth of the @entity70 , and it was moving to the northwest at 10 mph			1
but tropical - storm - force winds extended more than 200 miles from the center , and hurricane warnings stretched from @entity76 , @entity20 , to the @entity78 - @entity19 border			1
tropical storm warnings extended eastward to @entity80 , @entity19 , and westward from @entity76 to @entity81 , @entity20 , about 150 miles west of @entity0			1
there was also the potential for a lot of rain , as much as 18 inches in a few areas of @entity78 , @entity20 and @entity70 , the hurricane center said			1
as the storm heads north , its rain would benefit some drought - ravaged states like @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 and @entity95			1
@entity15 has not ordered an evacuation of his city , most of which is below sea level and protected by a network of levees			0
but he said he would " strongly urge " about 900 people who live outside the levee system to leave -- and if anyone else is thinking about getting out , " now would be a good time to go			0
" live blog : @entity2 moves in others in low - lying @entity20 parishes and in coastal counties and barrier islands of @entity70 , @entity78 and northwest @entity19 were told to clear out ahead of the storm			1
in @entity78 , state emergency management agency director @entity113 warned that strong winds and high water may affect the @entity117 area even if the storm hits as far west as @entity20			1
" it is a very large storm , " @entity113 said			2
" and oftentimes we confuse and focus on a specific dot that may be identified as the center of the storm when very dangerous conditions may exist as far as 200 miles from that specific dot			2
" the storm lashed @entity126 and the @entity127 over the weekend after slamming into @entity128 , where at least 19 people had been reported dead by monday , the country 's civil protection agency reported			2
the @entity59 projected storm surges of 3 to 6 feet for the @entity19 , 6 to 9 feet for the @entity78 coast and 6 to 12 feet for the @entity70 and southeastern @entity20 shores			1
in @entity135 , @entity70 , @entity134 authorities ordered residents of low - lying areas to evacuate monday evening			2
the @entity138 had already ordered visitors to leave the barrier islands off the @entity70 coast			0
@entity142 , which includes the coastal cities of @entity144 , @entity145 and @entity146 , ordered evacuations for anyone living south of @entity149 -- a major artery along the @entity70 coast -- or for those living in mobile homes , along rivers and in other vulnerable areas			2
" those residents that experienced flooding during @entity7 should evaluate what the effects of the possible 8 - 12 foot tidal surge would have to their property and make an informed decision with regard to evacuation , " a message from the county board of supervisors added			0
but on @entity168 , south of @entity117 , many residents were preparing to sit out @entity2 at home , said @entity170			1
" we are boarding up ( and ) getting supplies ready , " said @entity171 , who lives and tends bar on the island			0
" we 've had a little bit of people leave @entity168 , but not much			0
most of the locals are going to ride it out			0
" @entity168 was badly damaged by @entity7 , which cut the island in half -- a gouge since filled by sand and rock			0
the skies there were just clouding up monday afternoon , @entity171 said			0
@entity20 resident @entity188 plans to stay in place despite an evacuation order			1
he filled up gas tanks sunday night in case he has to run his generator			2
" starting to get a little sense of anxiety , like , ok , am i ready for it ? " he said			0
" realizing we ai n't really ready for a storm			2
so we 're just all thinking about what we got ta do to get in place to get ready for it			0
" residents of @entity204 and parts of @entity206 and @entity207 in @entity20 had been ordered to clear out as well			1
some 9,000 residents in @entity206 , @entity20 , were ordered to evacuate monday morning , along with the towns of @entity210 , @entity211 and @entity212			1
" we 're worried about tidal surge , " @entity210 mayor @entity213 said			0
airports across the region also made plans to shut down as the storm passed			0
@entity0 will shut its international airport after its last flight monday night , spokesman @entity221 said , while smaller airports in @entity70 , @entity78 and @entity19 also announced closures starting tuesday			1
@entity20 gov. @entity224 called on residents in coastal parishes prone to flooding to voluntarily evacuate			2
even pro football player @entity227 of the @entity228 was a little nervous			0
" kinda a scary feeling of uncertainty , " he said via @entity229			0
disaster dining : how to stay safe and stay fed in a storm @entity70 officials dispatched 1,500 @entity236 troops to the state 's three southern counties to help with emergency operations , as well as 45 state troopers to ease traffic flow			2
the state has distributed 10,000 sandbags to residents ahead of the storm			0
" in short , we have done everything in our power to be prepared for the storm , " @entity70 gov. @entity245 said			0
in the coastal @entity70 city of @entity251 , people were moving their boats to higher ground and preparing their homes			0
" @entity260 ' like we 're gon na be ground zero again , " said @entity255 , as he prepared to place sandbags in front of his doors and garage			0
" it seems like @entity7 just happened yesterday , " @entity255 told @entity1 affiliate @entity262			0
" hopefully we 'll dodge a bullet here this time			0
i did n't last time			0
" @entity266 : @entity2 pounds @entity268 beach it appeared monday that the storm 's ferocity would mostly bypass @entity19 's west coast and the @entity273 in @entity274 , where the schedule was pushed back a day by organizers over concerns about the storm			1
