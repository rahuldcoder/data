-- the world economy may be bracing for another grim year , but political donors in the @entity3 are breaking out their checkbooks to finance what is expected to be the most expensive presidential election in @entity3 history			1
the @entity8 estimates $ 6 billion will be spent in the @entity3 elections by campaigns , political parties and corporations hoping to propel their candidates into the @entity14 and what writer @entity15 once called the " best @entity17 money can buy			1
" the projected price tag of the 2012 @entity3 election dwarfs that of other nations , but corruption monitors from @entity22 ( @entity22 ) say it 's not just how much will be spent but where the money is coming from that threatens the integrity of politics around the world			1
@entity29 while the trajectory for spending in @entity3 elections is soaring , total party spending in the 2010 general election in the @entity29 was actually 26 % less than in 2005			1
but despite the fact party spending dropped to $ 49 million , the absence of limits on the amount individuals or corporations can donate has contributed to the ongoing erosion of public confidence in the political process in the @entity29 , according to one watchdog organization			0
" when donors are making contributions exceeding Â £ 20,000 ( $ 31,000 ) -- and some are making donations well over Â £ 250,000 ( $ 390,000 ) -- it 's perfectly understandable you do n't give away that kind of money without expecting something in return , " @entity55 , executive director of @entity22 @entity29			1
in november 2011 , a @entity29 advisory body recommended increased public funding as one way to avoid future scandals and limit the influence of big donors in elections , but the three main political parties rejected the proposal			0
@entity65 @entity55 , citing @entity66 as a model , believes increased public funding would cut down party dependence on large donations and give the election system more credibility			0
in @entity65 , government funding accounted for 74 % of political parties ' income in 2010 , according to @entity75			1
and unlike in the @entity3 , where candidates and their supporters can buy as much television time as they can afford , political ads are banned from television and radio			2
@entity82 corruption monitors say the lack of public funding in @entity82 , the world 's largest democracy , has contributed to a staggering influx of under the table corporate contributions to candidates that has undercut the integrity of recent elections			1
intelligence reports received by @entity82 's @entity95 suggested that upwards of $ 2 billion in so - called " black money " will be spent to influence the @entity98 state elections this year , according to @entity99 , executive director of @entity100			1
" everybody knows about black money , " @entity99 told @entity0			1
" corporations are expected to donate no more than 5 percent of their profits , but they pay more than that under the table			0
those who donate funds also control the politicians , and the politicians ( become ) more accountable to their sponsors than to their constituents			0
" @entity82 's @entity95 told @entity0 it is committed to curbing the use of money power in elections			1
but it 's not just corporate black money that 's a problem , but the buying of votes in poor areas with hard cash , and sometimes with smuggled liquor			1
in the 2009 election in @entity125 , a state with a population roughly the size of @entity128 , 33.4 % of voters received money from candidates ' supporters for their vote , according to a poll by @entity82 's @entity135 -- and in 2011 , voters were lured to the polls with blenders , grinders and other household appliances			1
but @entity140 says there 's a lack of political will to bring about fundamental change in politics in @entity82			2
" it 's extremely difficult to get into politics if you do n't grease somebody 's palm , " she said			0
" this is why good people do n't want to contest elections ... so ultimately you vote for corrupt people , because those are the only people you have to choose from			0
" @entity157 corruption monitors say the issue of big money in politics pales in comparison to the abuse of government resources by the @entity166 party of prime minister @entity167 , who announced on march 04 he had won @entity157 's presidential election , returning the former @entity170 officer to the office he held from 2000 to 2008			1
while there are no limitations on the amount @entity3 political parties can spend on televison ads , broadcast time in @entity157 is doled out on a limited basis , and is proportionate to the results of the last election			1
but as opposition parties prepare ads to maximize a limited amount of television time , nightly news broadcasts on state - run channels are filled with stories of @entity166 politicians repairing hospitals , or opening new underground rail stations -- officials benefitting politically from initiatives paid for with taxpayer money			2
" there are two sets of rules in @entity157 -- one set for parties who are paying out of their own pockets , and another for the party and candidates with access to public resources , " says @entity193 , head of @entity157			2
while opposition parties must finance campaign trips around the country during election season , incumbent politicians can campaign during official state - funded trips , according to @entity193			0
abuse of media and @entity157 's public resources may be time - tested tools of incumbents here , but that has n't stopped @entity166 from trying other ways to get a leg up on the competition			2
in november a crowd at a concert in @entity222 rained down boos on veteran rock band @entity224 -- @entity224 in @entity225 -- when they were introduced by an emcee who announced that the concert was backed by @entity166 and awarded them medals from the local governor			0
" the parties try to hijack whatever they can hijack in @entity157 , " @entity193 told @entity0			0
@entity231 another country where big money and elections go hand in hand is @entity231 , @entity237 's largest country and one of the world 's fastest growing economies			1
roughly $ 2 billion was spent by parties and candidates in the 2010 presidential election , according to @entity244 , executive director of @entity245			1
nearly 98 % of winner @entity247 's campaign donations -- and 95.5 % of her main opponent 's -- came from corporations , says @entity244			1
@entity244 says corporations donated 99.04 % of all money spent in @entity252 , @entity231 's most populous state , during the 2010 election -- a reflection mainly of voters ' apathy and politicians ' failure to form relationships with their constituents			1
" this is an enormous problem , " @entity244 told @entity0			0
" the distribution of money reveals something deeper in the @entity231 political landscape , which is that citizens are not very much concerned about supporting parties and having a political life			2
" while some observers want to ban corporate spending outright , @entity244 says that will only make it harder to track corporate influence on politics in the country			0
" the interests are still there even if you prohibit corporations from donating to candidates above the board , " he told @entity0			0
" they will do it in a hidden way , and they will lose visibility			0
" @entity286 while political finance watchdogs such as the @entity8 monitor the amount of money spent during @entity3 elections , a financial adviser for the @entity292 says no reliable information exists for how much money was spent during the 2011 presidential election in @entity286			1
while @entity286 law gives the country 's election commission the right to set a maximum spending limit for parties , the commission neglected to do so before the 2011 election , according to @entity304			2
" parties can do whatever they want , there 's no limit to the amount they can spend , " @entity304 told @entity0			0
" candidates do have limits , but the money they get from their parties is excluded from that limit			2
" while the 2011 elections were hailed as a step forward in @entity286 's evolution as a young democracy , the lack of restraint on political spending is a worrying development for election monitors			2
" it really was an expensive election not only at a presidential level but also at the gubernatorial level , especially down in the south , " said @entity304			0
" it 's an electoral system where you need to spend			0
" @entity29 corruption monitor @entity55 says an ever - increasing amount of money in elections is a global problem			2
" in many countries across the world , the cost of elections is increasing , " he told @entity0			0
" if parties and politicians ca n't find the resources from the state , there is an increasing desperation to seek them from private sources -- and that is where the corruption comes in			0
" @entity0 's @entity351 contributed to this report .			0

an estimated $ 6 billion will be spent by candidates , parties and outside groups in the 2012 @entity3 election
corruption monitors say billions of *dollars* in ' black money ' are *undermining* the integrity of @entity82 's elections
98 % of donations to @entity231 's 2010 presidential election winner came from corporations , @entity245 says
monitors say @entity166 abuses government resources to gain an edge on opponents
