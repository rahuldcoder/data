diver @entity0 swam deep into @entity2 's @entity1 in search of fossils and relics			1
in 40 feet of murky water , fighting the current , something shiny caught his eye			2
" without even shining my light on it , it was clear that it has weight to it , and it was metal or gold , " @entity0 said			1
" and when i shined my light on it , i said , wow , this is the first time i 've ever found jewelry underneath the water , " he said			0
but it was more than just jewelry			0
it was a ring that had become the " stuff of legend " since the owner lost it nearly 40 years ago			1
" i held onto it for the rest of the dive			0
i just did n't want to lose it , " @entity0 said			1
inscribed on the large , gold ring were the initials @entity32 and the date 1974			2
the ring also displayed the name of a nearby school : the @entity37			2
with those clues , @entity0 's journey to return the jewelry began			1
the hunt for @entity32 @entity0 first called the college 's alumni association			1
the college determined that only two people who graduated in 1974 had those initials , and one was female			0
now , @entity0 knew who he was looking for : @entity48			2
after searching on social media , @entity0 eventually connected with @entity48 's son , @entity50			1
@entity0 quizzed him to make sure he had tracked down the rightful owner			1
@entity50 e-mailed a copy of his father 's diploma , and @entity55 was convinced he was in the right place			1
@entity0 soon learned that like so many other things in life , this very simple college ring -- lost for so many years -- had more meaning to it than many will ever understand			1
@entity63 airport tries to find century - old lost teddy 's family another man 's treasure " my dad was a storyteller , kind of a used - car salesman at times , " @entity50 said			1
" he kind of has some of the same jokes , but he talked about the ring all the time because it came from his mother , and you know it 's just one of the stories that just epitomized a season of his life , " he told @entity72			2
@entity83 was boating on the @entity1 with his future wife , @entity84 , when he lost the ring in 1974 -- just two weeks after he got it			1
" he was very upset and hated to tell his mom that he lost it , " @entity86 said			0
" losing it in the river , we never thought we would never , ever , ever see it again , " she told @entity72			0
a symbol of success growing up without his father in his life , @entity83 was determined to succeed on his own			0
he graduated from the @entity37 with a degree in business administration			0
the ring , a symbol of all he had accomplished , was his mother 's last gift to him before she passed away from pancreatic cancer			2
@entity0 hoped he could return the cherished ring to @entity50 at his home , but @entity50 -- now fighting cancer -- was not there			1
he was rushed into surgery at the @entity107 in @entity108 last weekend for brain surgery			0
that setback did n't stop a reunion 39 years in the making			0
a few days after @entity50 ' operation , @entity0 met @entity50 in the hospital			1
with his family by his side , @entity50 sat in a hospital chair			1
his voice was barely above a whisper , but it was full of life as a stranger returned a part of his life to him			0
down on one knee , @entity0 opened up a ring box to reveal @entity50 's lost treasure			1
" i was down there fighting strong currents and alligators trying to get you your ring back , " said @entity0 , as @entity50 smiled			1
" and i 've got it here , and i know this is going to look like i 'm proposing to you , so please do n't tell my wife , ok , " he said , as the room erupted in laughter			0
that is awesome , " @entity50 said			2
how was a class ring found after 13 years ? coming full circle then , @entity50 began to tell @entity0 and everyone the story that his family has heard endlessly -- the story of the lost ring			1
" i was on the back of the boat			0
and i decided i needed a beer , " he said softly			0
" i pulled the pop top and when i did , my finger got caught in the pop top , and it went with it , " he told @entity150			0
" i guess i have to go have it sized now , do n't i , " he added with a grin			0
" you 've got a lot of years left			0
so , you 're going to be wearing that ring , " @entity0 responded			1
with his wife and two children watching this reunion of sorts , they all felt this ring would give their patriarch the comfort he needs right now			2
" no matter how much time he has with us , we 'll always have that ring			2
and it will always signify a good season of our life and a good memory of our father , and the fact that he got to share in it before he left us , " @entity50 said			2
in some ways , this decades - long loop of life has been closed , and a new story -- one that the @entity50 family will be telling for generations -- has been written			1
" thank you lord that i got it back , " @entity83 said			0
" i had a nightmare the other night that i lost it again , " he said			0
" no more beer cans , " he laughed .			0
