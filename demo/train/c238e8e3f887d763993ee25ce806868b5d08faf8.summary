-- the great @entity2 talking shop is now up and running , with delegates of all levels of importance , shapes and nationalities zeroing in on this quaint , alpine town to put the world to rights			1
for many ordinary people the annual meeting of the @entity12 ( @entity12 ) is yet another " important " summit in the calendar where the elite of business and politics will schmooze for a few days in a rarefied environment they have little or no experience of			1
whether or not you believe events such as @entity2 justify their lofty ambitions , they are certainly a unique experience			1
so how do you become a @entity2 delegate ? @entity28 invite the @entity12 is strictly by invitation only , with 2,600 participants representing over 100 countries			1
the roll call includes @entity33 and representatives from the world 's biggest corporations ; politicians and heads of state from the @entity39 and other key countries ; technology innovators ; social entrepreneurs ; philanthropists and media companies			0
however these special invitations -- or white badges -- are not free for everyone			0
unless you 're an anchor for one of the many broadcasters covering the event ; an academic ; a faith leader ; a @entity56 ( young people with great potential selected by the @entity12 from all fields of business ) ; a social entrepreneur ; or from an @entity62 , the average cost to a business to send each delegate is close to a whopping $ 20,000			1
huge travel budget getting to this small ski resort , nestled in a picturesque valley high up in the @entity67 150 km south - west of @entity64 , is not for the budget traveler			1
for a delegate arriving from @entity71 this week flying business class , the price comes in at between $ 4,200 and $ 5,300			1
a visitor from @entity74 can expect to pay between $ 7,200 and $ 10,500 , while a delegate flying in from @entity76 , @entity77 will pay around $ 4,150			1
and once in @entity64 there 's the small matter of the transfer to @entity2			1
a regular shuttle bus and train service is available , but a two - hour trip by public transport may not suit the business client			2
the alternative would be a limousine which would cost 650 @entity88 ( $ 689 ) for a one - way trip			2
however corporate ceos may choose to come by helicopter , which costs around $ 9,500 for a return flight			2
place to stay finding accommodation in @entity2 during the week of the @entity12 is not easy , with a limited number of large hotels			1
predictably tariffs reflect the resulting demand / supply imbalance , with a room in a modest three - star hotel coming in at around 500 @entity88 ( $ 530 ) per night			0
those with a considerably bigger budget often choose to rent out whole apartments or chalets			0
a chalet sleeping up to ten people for the week can command as much as 60,000 @entity88 ( $ 63,600 ) - though catering might just be included			0
the right outfit it 's cold in @entity2 , very cold			2
at 5,052 ft ( 1,540m ) above see level , temperatures average -6 degrees @entity110 ( 21.1 degrees @entity111 ) in january			0
thermal underwear , winter jackets and snow boots are a must , particularly when the temperature plummets in the evenings as you make your way to the various cocktail parties , meals and social events hosted by partner companies			0
it is not uncommon to see $ 2,000 bespoke suits finished off with bulky snow boots around the @entity128			0
knowing where to go with all the above boxes ticked , it is essential to have a plan once you have run the gauntlet of airport - style security -- there are 4,000 @entity67 troops in @entity2 this week -- and made it inside the newly - extended @entity128 with the correct color of identity pass			2
some delegates do nothing but network with other delegates , oblivious to the feverish discussions going all around them about the post-crisis new reality			0
so delegates can spend four days roaming this cavernous indoor amphitheater attending conferences and workshops about everything from how the environment agenda will change in light of current trends and norms , to how music can transform communities and unite people			0
$ 40,000 - per head well spent .			0
