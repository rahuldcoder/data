@entity0 -- the companies that have recalled more than half a billion eggs following a salmonella outbreak fell short of safety standards at their farms , @entity3 commissioner @entity2 said sunday			1
" there 's no question these farms involved in the recall were not operating with the standards of practice we consider responsible , " @entity2 told @entity1			2
she said " about 1,000 " people have been sickened by a salmonella outbreak that federal regulators have traced back to two @entity21 egg producers			1
one of those companies said sunday it is " devastated " by the possible connection between its product and salmonella			1
@entity27 of @entity21 announced friday it was recalling more than 170 million eggs			1
another 380 million have been recalled by another @entity21 producer , @entity30 , after the @entity3 linked the eggs to an outbreak of salmonella that has sickened hundreds of people nationwide			1
" we are devastated that our eggs have been implicated in making people sick , " @entity27 , one of the largest @entity37 producers , said in a statement issued sunday			1
" we have never had a product recall in our 45 - year history , and it flies in the face of our mission to provide wholesome , nutritious food for the @entity37 public			2
we regret that anyone might have become ill , and the concern and disruption this has caused our customers			0
" the eggs were shipped to 17 states across the country			0
the company said it would work with the @entity3 to review its " every phase of our operation " and fix any problems			1
@entity27 said it shared " a number of common suppliers " with @entity30 , including a company called @entity58 , which provided feed and young birds			1
both @entity63 and @entity58 are owned by the @entity65 family , which has a string of agribusiness interests in the @entity69 and @entity70			1
those companies ' records have come under new scrutiny since the recalls were announced earlier this month			0
in june , company owner @entity65 admitted to 10 civil counts of animal cruelty in @entity77 after a nonprofit animal welfare group conducted an undercover video investigation and forwarded its findings to @entity77 animal welfare officials			0
dr. @entity82 , the @entity77 state veterinarian , said the allegations included keeping too many birds in case , failing to treat injured chickens or promptly remove dead animals and improper euthanization			0
@entity82 said @entity65 and his company agreed to a $ 25,000 fine and made a $ 100,000 payment to reimburse the state for future monitoring of the facility			0
in 1996 , the @entity94 accused @entity65 of maintaining " sweatshop conditions " for migrant workers at its @entity96 , @entity77 , chicken farm , where then - labor secretary @entity97 said workers risked salmonella by handling dead chickens and manure with their bare hands			2
the @entity105 fined it $ 3.6 million			0
in january 2002 , the @entity107 hit another @entity65 company with allegations that its supervisors sexually assaulted and harassed female employees , including some of whom were in the country illegally , and threatened to retaliate against them if they complained			0
the managers were fired for " unrelated reasons , " the @entity107 said , and @entity65 agreed to pay a settlement of more than $ 1.5 million			2
and in 2000 , @entity21 's attorney general declared @entity65 a " habitual violator " of state environmental laws after a series of discharges of manure from his hog - farming operations			2
he paid a $ 150,000 penalty , had to build six concrete storage structures and his company was barred from expanding those operations			0
in a statement issued sunday night , @entity30 said it was working with the @entity3 on the current recalls and defended its record			1
" when issues have been raised about our farms , our management team has addressed them swiftly and effectively , working with recognized outside experts to identify and establish corrective measures for our operations , " it said			1
" we are approaching our work with @entity3 in the same forthright manner			1
" while the recall involves hundreds of millions of eggs , they represent less than 1 percent of the 80 billion eggs produced in the @entity37 each year , said @entity145 , director of the food safety program at the trade association @entity147			0
" this is one of the larger recalls that have happened , " @entity148 said			0
but she added , " this is an extremely rare occurrence			0
" @entity1 's @entity153 , @entity154 and @entity155 contributed to this report .			2
