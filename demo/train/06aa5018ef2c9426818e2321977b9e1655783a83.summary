dr. @entity0 has been under fire recently for promoting weight loss products on tv 's " the dr. @entity3 " that are n't backed by a lot of scientific evidence			1
now a study supporting one of those products , diet pills made with green coffee bean extract , has been withdrawn by its lead researchers			1
" the sponsors of the study can not assure the validity of the data so we , @entity21 and @entity22 , are retracting the paper , " the pair of scientists posted online			1
the small study , published in 2012 in the journal @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27 : targets and therapy , found that the main ingredient in green coffee beans helped human participants lose , on average , 18 pounds over 22 weeks			1
it was funded by @entity34 this year , the @entity35 filed a complaint ( @entity37 ) against the company , saying it paid researchers in @entity40 to conduct a trial on @entity42			0
the @entity35 says the study 's unnamed lead investigator " repeatedly : ( 1 ) altered the weights and other key measurements of the subjects ; ( 2 ) changed the length of the trial ; and ( 3 ) confused which subjects took either the placebo or @entity42 at various points during the trial			2
" in the complaint , the @entity35 says that @entity34 asked @entity21 and @entity53 to write up the @entity40 researcher 's study results for publication but that the pair of scientists never reviewed the raw data , despite noting several discrepancies in the data sets they received			1
" we retracted the paper because of an error in one of ( the ) data points on the @entity69 graph and because , as the @entity35 pointed out to us , there was inadequate disclosure of diet restrictions on the subjects and inadequate disclosure of the blinding procedures for the supplements given the subjects , " @entity21 and @entity22 said in a joint statement thursday			0
the researchers added that while they did not have the raw data collections , they did seek clarification from the @entity40 researcher on how the study was conducted and " at no time did we suspect the data provided were fraudulent			0
" " @entity34 knew or should have known that this botched study did n't prove anything , " @entity84 , director of the @entity35 's @entity85 , said after the company settled with the @entity35 in september			0
" in publicizing the results , it helped fuel the green coffee phenomenon			2
" the @entity35 says @entity92 also played a role in promoting the diet pills			1
@entity92 was grilled by a @entity96 panel in june over the weight loss products being publicized on his show			2
" in prior seasons , we covered @entity104 and its potential as a useful tool for weight loss , " the show posted on its website this week			0
" recently the authors of the peer reviewed research paper on which our coverage had been partially based formally retracted their study			0
while this sometimes happens in scientific research , it indicates that further study is needed regarding any potential benefits of @entity104			0
