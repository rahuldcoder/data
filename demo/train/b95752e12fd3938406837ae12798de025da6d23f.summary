-- with talk about the 2016 election heating up , most of the national media has turned the focus on former secretary of state @entity6 and vice president @entity7			1
@entity8 and @entity7 would be formidable candidates			2
either would be a logical successor to president @entity11 as the leader of the @entity13			2
yet if they are to be successful , they will need to look outside the beltway to learn about the kinds of issues that are animating voters outside of @entity20			0
they would do well to draw on some of the ideas that have been percolating in recent months from newer voices in the party			0
and at a time when politicians can suffer quick downfalls , as @entity26 gov. @entity25 is learning , @entity13 would do well to make sure that they have other potential candidates who can compete on the national stage , should @entity8 or @entity7 fail to materialize as 2016 candidates			1
inside politics : @entity6 's telling words about critics whoever runs , the future of the @entity13 may lie in learning from two mayors , two governors and a gubernatorial candidate who are all building on the traditional @entity13 theme of security -- a theme that has been central to the party since @entity46 -- but trying to do so in new ways			1
@entity13 have an exciting group of mayors who have been garnering enthusiasm for their efforts to tackle the big economic and social issues that @entity20 seems incapable of resolving			1
in @entity54 , mayor @entity53 has launched a full - scale attack on economic inequality			1
his campaign captured national attention when he spoke about the tale of two cities , one poor , struggling and devastated , and the other wealthy and thriving			0
@entity61 kicked off his time in office with ambitious proposals for affordable housing as well as prekindergarten education			0
he 's already run into obstacles , including tensions with @entity54 's gov. @entity69 , who shot down his plan for a higher minimum wage			1
@entity61 has had to fend off complaints about snow removal and controversy over his call to a police official to ask about the arrest of a pastor , who has been one of his strong supporters			0
still , the mayor has excited @entity13 about the possibilities for the revitalization of urban liberalism			2
@entity85 : enough already with the obsession over @entity6 @entity88 mayor @entity87 , who delivered the keynote address at the @entity90 , has devoted energy to the challenges facing @entity93 in his city			1
he has made an impassioned plea to treat immigration as a human rights issue , urging @entity98 to provide a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants			0
he has also been addressing the issues that greatly concern working families , such as prekindergarten education and job creation			0
the mayor has been able to boast about its strong economic record in 2013 , with growth in health care as well as oil and gas development , in addition to a thriving housing market			0
@entity88 is frequently placed in various top 10 lists of thriving @entity116 cities			0
@entity13 governors have also been making waves			1
in @entity120 , one potential 2016 presidential candidate , @entity119 , has been responding to social and cultural changes that have been transforming the nation in recent years			1
@entity119 has been one of the governors to preside over the legalization of medical marijuana and to oppose the death penalty			1
he championed economic and financial assistance to illegal immigrants , such as legislation that offers in - state tuition rates for universities			0
he has also been a staunch supporter of tougher gun control , something that the national parties have failed to achieve even in the aftermath of horrendous shooting incidents			0
@entity120 has made some notable progress in education as well as in attracting innovative companies to the state			0
gov. @entity69 in @entity54 has tried to combine tough fiscal discipline with an ongoing commitment to the social safety net			2
@entity69 has demonstrated his willingness to question some political orthodoxies among @entity13			1
early in his term , @entity69 took on public employee unions and got big concessions from them in his effort to limit spending and taxes			2
like @entity119 , he has supported same - sex marriage legislation			1
@entity69 backed legislation that imposed higher taxes on wealthier @entity54 earlier in his term , though he disagreed with @entity53 's push for further increases this year , when @entity69 is running for re-election			1
he , too , has obtained stricter gun controls at a time that the federal government seemed paralyzed on the issue another source of new ideas is @entity165 , a former assistant secretary of @entity166 and former @entity0 contributor			0
she is seeking the @entity13 nomination for @entity170 governor against @entity171			2
@entity165 is running a campaign centered on the need for government to help restore security to middle - class families			1
@entity165 is proposing ideas to promote the interests of working women , including efforts to eliminate the wage gap and to enable affordable childcare			0
she is tackling structural problems in the economy with ideas for improving public transportation and investing in community colleges			0
building on her experience in government , she is also looking for better ways to provide physical security by dealing with vulnerable infrastructure that national policymakers have not done enough to protect			2
@entity13 are building a sizable farm team in the states , filled with new voices and innovative ideas that will play a big role in the coming years : support for education , educational assistance to immigrants , job growth programs , child care , gun controls and more			2
only of few of these candidates might be ready for the national spotlight -- like @entity119 and maybe @entity69 -- but the others might have bright futures on the horizon			1
given the gridlock in @entity20 , @entity8 , @entity7 and anyone else running in 2016 would do well to look to the state and local level as they craft their agenda			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity219 .			0

@entity219 : if they run in 2016 , @entity6 and @entity7 need new ideas
