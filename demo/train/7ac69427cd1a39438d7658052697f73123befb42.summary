-- the amazing discoveries from @entity4 's @entity3 planet - hunting space telescope keep rolling in			1
the latest , announced this week by astronomers , is the discovery of a planet just 10 % larger than the @entity8 orbiting in the so - called " habitable zone " of the star @entity10			1
in our solar system , @entity8 is the only planet in the habitable zone -- the distance from the sun where liquid water can exist on the surface without boiling away ( like on @entity19 ) , or turning to ice ( like on @entity21 )			1
the new planet , imaginatively dubbed @entity3 - 186f for now , appears to be in the same kind of @entity25 place in its solar system			1
not too hot , not too cold , just right			0
186f could be the closest planet yet found			2
it could be @entity8 2.0			2
the @entity3 telescope can detect planets like 186f and tell us their size , but it ca n't tell us what they 're made of or what they 're like			1
is 186f a rocky planet like the @entity8 with a thin atmosphere and oceans and continents ? or does it have a thick atmosphere and a small rocky core ? or is it a big metallic body with no atmosphere at all ? or something else entirely ? over the past decade a veritable zoo of planets has been discovered around other stars using a variety of telescopic methods , from hot @entity52 ( giant planets close in to their star ) to super @entity8 ( rocky worlds many times the size of our planet )			1
add to that the amazing diversity of planets and moons that we 've discovered right here in our own solar system during the past four decades from the @entity67 spacecraft and other missions , the variety is astounding			2
even if 186f does n't turn out to be @entity8 - like , the number of actual @entity8 - like extrasolar planets out there appears to be staggering			1
during its four - year mission , @entity72 observed just a tiny , random , average piece of the sky , one you would cover with your fist held at arm 's length			0
more than 1,000 planets have been discovered so far from just the nearby stars in that tiny patch of the sky			0
@entity86 , for example , is " just " 500 light years away -- a veritable next - door neighbor on the galactic scale			0
if you extend the results of that little survey across the entire , 100,000 - light - year - wide @entity91 galaxy , you end up concluding that there are likely to be tens of billions of @entity8 - sized planets in our galaxy alone			1
and many of them must be orbiting in their sun 's habitable zones as well			0
astronomers are scrambling to use other telescopes , on the ground and in space , to try to figure out what 186f and the thousand other new worlds discovered so far are really like			1
and new space observatories are being planned to try to follow up and expand on the results from the @entity3 ( which stopped collecting new planet data last year )			0
the implications of what they find could be profound , especially if they 're able to detect an atmosphere there , and -- the @entity116 -- especially if that atmosphere contains telltale gases like water vapor , oxygen , or methane , key indicators that the place may be habitable			0
just because a planet is in a star 's habitable zone , though , and just because it has an environment that is potentially habitable , does n't mean that planet is necessarily inhabited			2
but there are astronomers looking out for that possibility , too			0
it 's no coincidence , for example , that the lead author of the study that discovered 186f , dr. @entity136 , is from a research organization called the @entity138 , or @entity138 , institute			2
i 'm sure other @entity138 astronomers are making extra efforts to train their radio telescopes on @entity10 and those other recently discovered exoplanet systems , to listen for any stray signals			0
or , perhaps , they 'll find a targeted signal , a cosmic " hello ? " beamed our way by our neighboring astronomers on 186f , who are also trying desperately to answer the question , " are we alone ? "			0

@entity4 's *kepler* telescope discovered a planet that is 10 % larger than @entity8
@entity156 : the new planet , 186f , may or may not be inhabitable
he says there appears to be a large number of @entity8 - like extrasolar planets
@entity156 : @entity164 supports the idea that habitable worlds are probably *common*
