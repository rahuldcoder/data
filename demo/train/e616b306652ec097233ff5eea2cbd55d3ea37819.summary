@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity3 and @entity4 stepped up efforts to open other aid routes wednesday after a leading relief agency complained that air traffic congestion in @entity0 was costing lives on the ground			1
@entity11 has blamed five deaths on the delays , telling reporters that flights carrying drugs , surgical supplies and dialysis machines have been diverted from @entity0 to the neighboring @entity20 three times since sunday			1
" if we do n't move now , we will lose patients , as we did , " @entity21 , an official at the group 's hospital in the @entity0 slum of @entity25 , told @entity2 tuesday			2
" we lost two patients tonight because we do n't have the capacity to do more			0
" at least 72,000 people have been confirmed dead in the magnitude 7.0 earthquake that struck @entity1 january 12 , according to the country 's prime minister			0
international aid contributions have totaled hundreds of millions of dollars since then , but relief agencies on the ground say transportation bottlenecks and poor communications have slowed the delivery of food , water and medicine to survivors			0
the @entity3 military , which has been assisting @entity1 authorities in controlling air traffic into @entity0 , says the single - runway airport has been handling up to 180 flights a day			1
but in an effort to open up the flow , the @entity3 military said wednesday that it has obtained landing rights at the @entity20 's air base at @entity54 , near the capital of @entity56 , about 220 km ( 150 miles ) east of @entity0			1
lt. gen. @entity57 , the head of the @entity3 military task force in @entity1 , told @entity2 's " @entity63 " that any aircraft identified as carrying medical supplies has priority for landing rights			1
aircraft are only turned away " if there 's no parking space on the ramp , and they do n't have sufficient fuel to hold in their holding pattern			0
" but he said wednesday night one aircraft was sent back to the @entity20 " that we should have put on the ground , but we did not know what was on it because it was not posted			0
" " if the air traffic controller knows what 's on the plane and what the tail number is and he has three planes stacked up and he knows one of them has got medical supplies on it and that 's the top priority identified by the government of @entity1 , then that plane is going to come in , " @entity57 said			1
in addition , the @entity93 is dispatching a ship equipped with cranes that could get the port of @entity0 back into operation " within a week or two , perhaps , " defense secretary @entity92 told reporters wednesday during a visit to @entity101			0
and @entity4 troops are working to open up an airfield in the southern city of @entity106 by thursday , @entity4 defense minster @entity102 said			1
" this achievement is crucial , as it will allow the @entity4 forces access to a viable landing strip 24 hours a day , making it easier to ensure a continuous flow of aid supplies and equipment , " @entity102 announced in a statement from @entity108			2
meanwhile , he said , two warships are landing supplies by sea , and @entity4 has reached an agreement with @entity120 to fly supplies into southern @entity1 from there			2
a senior @entity3 military official , speaking on condition of anonymity , said wednesday that the priorities for aid flights are set " by the government of @entity1 first and then by the @entity128 second			1
" but the number of flights that can land at @entity0 is " a sheer issue of physics and geometry ; you just ca n't get them all in there			0
" " there are great people on the ground , working very , very hard to try and get as much in as they can as fast as they can , and try and keep everybody impressed that we are there to support them			0
but there are some people that are just not going to be happy because we ca n't get it all , " the official said			0
the @entity3 military has the capability to build dirt runways that rugged cargo planes like the @entity153 can use , but the equipment needed to build those is " always at a premium , " the official said			2
the @entity3 military has nearly 50 helicopters in the field that can help move supplies around the stricken country , he said .			2
