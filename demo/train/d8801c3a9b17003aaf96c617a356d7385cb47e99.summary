-- we 've all done things in our past we might prefer the general public not talk about , but only the lucky few get to be the targets of whole industries dedicated to digging those things up			0
and apparently @entity11 , that is if the abrupt resignation of @entity15 's new chief @entity14 is any indication			1
for many , the story of @entity14 -- who stepped down this week amid criticism of his contribution to a 2008 initiative to ban same - sex marriage -- is one of freedom of speech trampled by the intolerant			1
i do n't see it that way			0
do n't get me wrong ; to paraphrase @entity28 , i disagree with @entity14 's views on marriage equality but will defend to the death his @entity33 right to express them			1
but as i 've written in the past , the @entity33 does n't protect him , @entity15 , or anyone else from others ' using their @entity33 right to signal their disapproval			2
to me , @entity14 's case is about the power of information , and how -- with technology , 24 - hour news and social media - - everyone 's past is just a hashtag away from being the present			1
sometimes this is a good thing for the public , like the digging up of @entity54 's @entity53 past as he attempted to climb the political ladder			2
sometimes the information is significant , but used mainly to score points against a political opponent , as in the @entity60 's escalation of the @entity63 - @entity62 saga			2
but more often than not it 's about gossip to sell magazines or get clicks on a website			0
@entity69 , one of the stars of " @entity71 of @entity72 , " for example , is currently trying to explain why a 20 - year - old mug shot of her is on the cover of @entity76			0
the @entity78 family members , of @entity80 fame , were exposed as frauds after photos of the clan looking less like down - home folks and more like a @entity86 ad began circulating on the @entity87			0
the more notable a person is the riskier the strategy of distancing him or herself from the past in hopes that it just goes away			0
did @entity15 even think about this ? to @entity14 's credit , he has stuck with his position on same - sex marriage despite a torrent of complaint from inside and outside his company			1
that the company did n't anticipate the backlash is the real head - scratcher			2
six years ago , when @entity14 donated to an anti-marriage equality initiative , less than 40 % of @entity105 favored marriage for same - sex couples			1
today 54 % do , including nearly 70 % of people ages 18 - 29			0
that latter number is particularly important to @entity15 because 1 ) no group goes online more than millennials , 2 ) no group supports marriage equality more than millennials , and 3 ) millennials are a significant portion of current and future employees			1
the @entity120 fallout is less about the @entity33 and more about a business not understanding its business			0
the country 's present attitude regarding same - sex marriage is not top secret			1
and neither is @entity14 's past			1
@entity15 should 've had a better strategy than " let 's hope nobody notices			2
" yet the fact that the board caved to the pressure , instead of standing behind its choice , suggested it was completely blindsided by the uproar			0
this is mind - boggling considering that the controversies surrounding @entity139 and @entity140 did not happen in an alternate universe			0
by all accounts @entity14 , who helped develop some of the @entity143 's most important technologies , was qualified for the job and @entity15 would likely be hurt by his resignation			1
but @entity15 is an activist organization more than a money - making corporation			2
the @entity148 and @entity149 of the world can lure top young talent with money and perks			0
@entity15 's recruiting success depends on its ability to sell its mission			1
thus the effectiveness of the ceo rests heavily on his or her ability to foster a community , not just make a buck			0
and generally speaking , discrimination is a community buzzkill			0
still , the company 's leadership , not @entity14 , is to blame for this pr nightmare , they 're the ones who thought what happened in 2008 stays in 2008 .			1

@entity173 : @entity15 ceo resigned after *firestorm* over 2008 donation to *anti-same* - sex marriage @entity176
he says this is less a free speech issue than a poor move in the first place by @entity15 board
far more in @entity105 , particularly millennials ( @entity15 's *consumers* ) are *pro-gay* marriage than in 2008
@entity173 : @entity15 should have *planned* how it would handle the *inevitable* backlash over @entity14
