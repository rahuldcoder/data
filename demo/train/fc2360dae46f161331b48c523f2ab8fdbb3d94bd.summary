@entity0 , @entity1 -- in a tea shop in @entity0 , a dusty town in northeastern @entity1 , an empty kettle hangs on a hook waiting to be used , while flies hover over baskets piled high with sweetmeats drying out in the july sunshine			1
the surrounding streets are unusually quiet -- no children playing , no old men selling fruit , no whir of machinery from local workshops			0
the buzz of life has been replaced by deathly silence in the largest town in @entity1 's troubled @entity21			1
much of it now lies in ruin , its population nowhere to be seen			0
in a rare visit organized by @entity1 's military , i was one of the few journalists transported into the region where the army has been waging a full - scale ground offensive against militants since mid-june			1
the operation has been named @entity35 after a famous sword of the prophet @entity37			2
maj. general @entity38 , the commander of the @entity1 army 's @entity39 and the man in charge of the operation , told @entity2 that in the months leading up to campaign , the region had become " a hub and safe haven " for militants -- foreign and local -- in @entity1			1
for almost three weeks , @entity21 , a mountainous region bordering @entity48 , was pummeled by a series of air strikes before ground troops moved in			1
according to @entity38 , 80 % of @entity0 and its surrounding areas have been cleared of militants			1
unfortunately , the local population appears to have been cleared too			0
the head of @entity1 's @entity56 ( @entity56 ) , maj. general @entity55 , guides us through various compounds recovered in the town , which is now back under military control			1
leaving the 7th division base , we 're driven through a land of beige , past villages such as @entity65 , which has been hit by drone strikes and now lies abandoned			2
soldiers stand guard outside a suspected @entity71 compound near the village			0
according to @entity55 , recovered pamphlets and papers indicate it was used by fighters affiliated with the terror network			0
we 're led down a series of steep steps inside the compound , and we find ourselves in a cold , labyrinth of tunnels , with only the dim light from our torches to guide us			0
@entity55 tells us the tunnels " go on for at least two kilometers			0
" it 's a formidable operating base for militants			2
the drive to the town proper is surreal : vintage film music plays as the soldiers accompanying us discuss the @entity94 - @entity93 @entity92 match the previous night			0
outside our windows , we see troops searching blast - damaged and hollowed - out buildings			2
we 're told not to stray from the group since the area has not been completely cleared of improvised explosive devices ( @entity101 ) -- the signature bomb of militants in the region			1
according to maj. @entity106 , at least 23 tons of ied - making equipment has been recovered from @entity0			2
in the courtyard of a house in the battered remains of the town 's bazaar , guns and ammunition have been displayed in abstract designs , bullets placed in macabre symmetry			2
military officials tell us that this was the compound used by the @entity119 -- a murky terror group blamed for attacks in other countries in the wider region such as @entity124			1
we 're shown the in - house dental clinic that they had established for themselves			0
alleged terrorists get toothaches , too , it would seem			0
a mosque provides the front for another underground hideout ; a series of steps lead up to a bookshelf that opens up like a door into a secret passageway that we 're told was used as an escape route			0
it seems that no one was captured			0
maj. @entity106 says leaders of other groups such as the @entity1 @entity144 fled into @entity48 before the ground operation began			1
" they now manage things from across the border , " he says			0
military sources say over 400 militants have been killed in this operation , but information about which groups they are affiliated with is vague			1
meanwhile , the number of internally displaced people from @entity21 has now reached over 876,000 , according to figures released by the @entity157 , @entity1 's federal government organization that administers the @entity159			1
despite the access , details about the captured militants seem opaque			0
as we 're leaving @entity21 , we find that a new militant group called @entity165 has declared its existence , claiming that the regions of " @entity172 , @entity173 , @entity174 , @entity175 , @entity176 , @entity177 and other parts of @entity21 are under the full control of @entity144 while security forces are only controlling @entity169 and @entity170			1
" the military denies the existence of any such group			2
" we will never let militants return to @entity21 , " @entity38 tells the press in this valley in the foothills of the @entity185			1
yet the very next day , @entity187 , the spokesperson of the shadowy @entity165 claims they " will welcome security forces with bullets in @entity21			1
" this month of alleged gains by the @entity193 , it would seem is only the beginning for operation @entity196 - e - @entity35			0
journalist @entity197 contributed to this report from @entity199 .			0

@entity0 remains empty after @entity1 military operation in @entity21

@entity21 pummeled by air strikes before ground troops moved in
