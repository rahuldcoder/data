-- when a client asked @entity5 to furnish his daughter 's 500 - square foot , one - bedroom apartment in @entity3 , the interior designer met her match			0
she struggled to find furniture scaled for a small space that served multiple purposes			1
most sofas were too large to fit through the front door , let alone inhabit a hybrid living room - kitchenette			0
tables , beds and ottomans lacked the storage space needed by a college student with a lot of clothing , handbags and shoes			0
so @entity24 took matters into her own hands , designing banquettes that held pots and pans and turned into beds , a storage ottoman that doubled as a seat and coffee table and modular bedroom storage units that fit through the front door			0
working with craftsmen in @entity38 , @entity39 -- striking distance from @entity24 ' home office in @entity42 -- she came up with a stylish collection of upholstered furniture and hardwood storage units in less than three months			1
after the apartment was finished , she began hearing from others who wanted the same small , multipurpose pieces			2
" at that point , i said to my husband , ' i think there 's a real opportunity and need here , ' " said @entity24 , who has been working in interior design in @entity3 and @entity39 for more than 30 years			1
it might sound counterintuitive considering the decline of @entity61 manufacturing in the post-industrial age , especially in the furniture industry			1
products that are especially labor - intensive , such as hardwood and metal furniture , were the first to go overseas			2
nowadays , most household furniture sold in the @entity61 is imported , according to the @entity68 , with the exception of upholstered furniture , because most of it is custom - ordered			1
still , consumer spending on household furnishings continues to post modest year - to - year increases , according to the latest figures from the @entity61 @entity76			0
after all , the life events that trigger furniture purchases persist , such as births , children growing up and moves to new homes , said @entity83 , vice president of corporate communications for the @entity68			2
small companies have found they can compete if they produce specialty or high - quality items that sell for a premium , according to @entity89 , part of the company @entity92 , which provides business and industry insights			1
@entity24 was confident she had found a ripe niche market and spent the next two years developing prototypes			0
in 2012 , she and her husband launched the @entity100 , a line of multipurpose modular furniture for small spaces			1
the business represented a reunion for the couple , who ran an advertising agency together in the 1980s and 1990s			0
they shuttered the business in the online boom , and @entity5 pursued interior design while @entity24 went into online marketing			0
as her small space prototypes took shape , she decided to draw upon her husband 's expertise in marketing , brand positioning and business development			2
their son , @entity121 , joined a few months later to handle digital operations , sales and business development			0
the @entity100 pieces are undeniably an investment -- dressers start at $ 1,300 and sofa beds start at $ 2,100			1
but that 's the point , said @entity24 , to create high - quality pieces made by skilled tradespeople that can be passed down			1
the @entity100 relies on a small network of manufacturing partners within driving distance of the @entity24 ' home in @entity138			1
@entity5 found them during her years working as an interior designer			0
having a close manufacturing network allows the @entity100 to keep its carbon footprint low and lets @entity24 regularly visit to keep on top of projects			1
" i have very high standards and they all share my dedication to quality craftsmanship , " she said			1
" they 're great at what they do , but they 're also reliable ; they deliver when they say they 're going to deliver , and they do a great job			0
" @entity24 pays regular visits to the @entity158 , @entity39 , upholstery manufacturing plant of @entity159 , which makes sofa and sleeper beds			1
owner @entity162 , whose father started the company in 1943 , says high - end clients like the @entity100 help keep his business alive			1
because of offshoring and global competition , he acknowledges they 're past the days when several trucks left loaded with products every day			0
" no matter how cheap we are , we 're not cheap enough , " he said in a phone interview			0
" we 've maintained our quality level and that 's working out for us ; that 's the only reason we 're still here , because some people still want quality products			2
we 're holding our own and we 're going to stay that way			0
" @entity24 also visits @entity181 several times a month in her workshop on the main drag of the coastal town of @entity186 , @entity39			1
there , @entity181 and her son , @entity187 , work with a small team to construct upholstered banquettes and ottomans			2
a few miles up @entity193 , @entity194 and his family build hardwood dressers and storage units in a workshop in the old @entity200 factory in @entity201 , @entity39			1
in the year since launching , the @entity100 has shifted its focus toward commercial work for hotels and planned communities , in the interest of maximizing operating margins			2
the company also entered into a deal with a luxury apartment development in @entity3 to furnish model apartments , allowing it to offer its furniture for sale to tenants as an in - house design concierge service			2
as a new business , the company is still finding its footing and enjoying each moment , @entity24 said			0
" i 'm doing what i love and i 'm doing it with my family and other families who share our passion , " she said			2
" even on bad days , you know you 're working toward something positive			0
how is that a bad thing ? "			0
