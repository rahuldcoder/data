" a significant tsunami was generated by this earthquake			2
however , sea level readings now indicate that the threat has diminished or is over for most areas , " the center said			0
how are earthquakes measured ? the center earlier said that " when no major waves have occurred for at least two hours after the estimated arrival time or damaging waves have not occurred for at least two hours , then local authorities can assume the threat is passed			0
" the center posted approximate arrival times for waves in different parts of the region , which were predicted at various times in different cities throughout the day			0
waves were reported at 1 - meter ( about 3.3 - foot ) amplitude -- or height above sea level -- offshore in @entity75 , @entity1 , but in other cities , they were reported at about a foot or less , according to the warning center			1
@entity80 prime minister @entity79 announced that @entity80 " stands ready to help if required			0
" the first quake took place at 2:38 p.m. local time ( 4:38 a.m. et )			0
it appears to have involved a horizontal movement rather than a vertical movement , so it is less likely that it will generate a tsunami , @entity21 said			0
he also said that the tremor took place a long way offshore and was therefore unlikely to have caused much damage			0
still , officials called on coastal residents in some low - lying areas in the region to seek higher ground			1
the power went out in @entity11 , and residents moved to higher elevations , said @entity102 , a spokesman for the @entity103			0
the areas most at risk of a tsunami are coastal areas of @entity13 , particularly the island of @entity46 , @entity107 , an official for the @entity1 geophysics agency , said on @entity109			1
in some areas , residents were allowed to return after the tsunami watch was lifted			0
in @entity114 , the @entity113 issued an evacuation order for residents and tourists along the @entity119 coast , state - run news agency @entity112 said			1
" the tremor was felt as far as in @entity122 where office workers at several high - rise buildings said their workplaces were shaken " for three to five minutes , the report said			1
" several southern provinces also felt the tremors			0
" in the @entity129 , some resorts were evacuated in advance of possible waves , according to @entity2 's @entity132 , who was on vacation in the region			0
" what strikes me most is essentially the lack of a warning system " in the @entity129 , she said			1
officials rely primarily on information from the @entity9 , @entity132 said			0
