the deafening roar of state - of - the - art warplanes being catapulted into the air from its huge flight deck signaled that the @entity5 @entity4 was back in combat mode after its recent detour to the @entity8 to take part in the aid effort in the wake of @entity12			1
barely a week on and the 90,000 - ton nimitz - class aircraft carrier is now patrolling waters off the island of @entity16 as part a huge naval exercise -- @entity18 2013 -- involving dozens of warships , submarines and aircraft from the @entity23 's 7th fleet and the @entity24 ( @entity24 )			1
the aim ? to provide a stern test of their ability to effectively and mutually respond to the defense of @entity30 or to a regional crisis or contingency situation in the @entity33 , according to the @entity23			2
but this year 's war games have taken on an added dimension given the high - pressure atmosphere in the region at present -- they take place in the shadow of a controversial new @entity40 announced by the @entity41 last weekend			1
this zone , which incorporates among other areas an @entity45 island chain at the center of an acrimonious tug of war between @entity48 and @entity49 , requires that all military aircraft in the area must report their flight plans to @entity41 , maintain two - way radio and clearly mark their nationalities on the aircraft			1
@entity41 has warned it will take " defensive measures " if their orders are ignored			2
' steady as you go ' the commander of the @entity63 7th fleet , vice admiral @entity61 , appeared relaxed about the situation while addressing a group of reporters aboard the @entity5 @entity4			1
he said while @entity41 's air defense zone did not appear to be " well thought out " given the overlap with both @entity30 and @entity70 territorial claims , he did not think @entity63 military activity in the region would be negatively affected			1
" we are going to continue with our operations in international airspace as we always have , " he said			0
" it 's about international norms , standards , rules and laws			2
when anybody makes an extreme claim it is really an imperative that the international community can continue to operate in accordance with international law and not be distracted			0
" so for us it 's ' steady as you go			2
' our operations in the @entity45 will continue as they always have			0
" ' profoundly dangerous ' @entity30 , which administers the largely uninhabited island chain -- known as @entity94 by @entity41 and @entity94 by the @entity30 -- has described @entity41 's move as " a profoundly dangerous act that may cause unintended consequences in the area , " while @entity63 secretary of state @entity99 said " this unilateral action constitutes an attempt to change the status quo in the @entity45			1
@entity104 action will only increase tensions in the region and create risks of an incident			0
" @entity41 has rebuffed any criticism by stating that its action is not directed at any one in particular , and that other countries -- including @entity30 -- have established similar control zones in the past			1
in recent months , both sides have been involved in a dangerous game of " cat and mouse , " prompting fears that any miscalculation could set the two @entity121 powers on a collision course -- with the @entity63 likely to be dragged into such a conflict to defend its @entity30 ally			1
@entity48 says it has twice scrambled fighter jets this month after @entity41 aircraft appeared on course to enter its airspace			1
for its part , @entity41 lodged a complaint after it said a @entity30 warship recently entered waters where the @entity133 ( @entity133 ) @entity23 was holding live - fire drills , noting " the provocative move may have led to unexpected emergencies			1
" meanwhile , @entity41 's first aircraft carrier , the " @entity138 , " set sail this week from its home port of @entity140 in eastern @entity41			1
according to the @entity142 's website , it will head for the @entity143 to " conduct scientific experiments and military training			2
" this course would take it through the @entity45 accompanied by four other warships			0
restraint yet with so many potential flashpoints in the region , @entity61 is optimistic that conflict will be avoided			0
he pointed to the professionalism shown by the armed forces on all sides in the region as the basis for this confidence			0
" the @entity70 have shown great restraint with regard to @entity159 and those severe provocations , while the @entity161 has also been very measured , " he said			0
significantly , he pointed to @entity41 's development of a " world class " navy , with a level of professionalism that matches its improving infrastructure			1
" the more confident they become in their own capabilities , then this will actually ' depressurize ' the situation , " he said			0
he added that the @entity142 was no longer an unpredictable , conscription - based force training only at certain times of the year			0
he said the @entity142 was now showing signs of being able to operate far beyond its own waters , carrying out missions -- such as anti-piracy patrols -- that could make it a useful and responsible global operator			0
humanitarian challenge with f - 18 fighters taking off and landing almost every few minutes , it was easy to forget the role the carrier played in the @entity185 more than a week ago			0
many of its fighter jets were flown back to @entity30 to make room for more helicopters able to ferry in supplies to remote areas of the @entity8 in the wake of @entity12			2
" the ship became a ' lily pad ' for relief operations , " said the carrier 's commander , rear admiral @entity194			2
" this is something we 'll train more for , " he added , citing the need for a modern navy to be able to adapt to an increasingly diverse range of challenges and missions within its theater of operations			0
" it was humbling to be able to take part in the extraordinary humanitarian effort in the @entity8			0
" yet the sight of dozens of warships in tight formation in high seas off @entity30 was another reminder of how serious the @entity63 and @entity30 are taking the threat to regional security -- undeniably their biggest challenge .			1
