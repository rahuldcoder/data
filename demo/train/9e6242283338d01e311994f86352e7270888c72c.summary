-- in the past week sanctions have been handed down in both @entity2 and @entity3 in relation to a growing trend that is fast becoming a stain on soccer 's integrity -- match - fixing			1
but @entity10 , the worldwide players ' union , are preparing a project to tackle fixing , that will include an education program and an online tool for their members to report illegal approaches			1
match - fixing has proved a particular problem for @entity3 football in recent years			1
@entity21 were hit with a two - point penalty that dropped them from third to fifth in @entity24 as part of an ongoing investigation , though they vehemently deny any wrongdoing			0
defender @entity28 is appealing his six - month ban for failing to report an illegal approach			0
@entity32 coach @entity31 recently returned from a 10 - match touchline ban imposed for failing to report match - fixing while coach at @entity36			1
in 2006 , @entity32 were stripped of two league titles and relegated to the third division of @entity3 football -- before later being reinstated in the second tier -- for their part in the " @entity42 " scandal			0
elsewhere , the president of the @entity44 ( @entity44 ) and four other officials were suspended this week as part of an investigation into match - fixing ahead of the country hosting the @entity49 in 2010			1
it is alleged four friendly games were prearranged for the benefit of convicted @entity55 match - fixer @entity53 and his @entity57 organization			0

" it is not solely a problem of individual countries , as recent reports and incidents have proven that match fixing is widespread in numerous nations on all continents : from @entity69 to @entity93 , from @entity94 to @entity3			2
" in @entity10 's opinion , one of the ways to reduce the incidence of match fixing and the potential for match fixing in football is education of the players : the campaigns need to be taken into the dressing rooms of the clubs			1
" once their online reporting method is up and running @entity10 estimate a total of 12,000 players and 20,000 people associated with the game will be able to disclose any bullying , intimidation , harassment , and inappropriate approaches .			2
