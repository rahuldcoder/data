gay - rights activists in @entity1 warned monday of mounting violence against homosexuals after parliament passed controversial legislation last week that would make some gay acts punishable with life in prison			1
" the witch hunt had already started , and now it has been legitimized by the parliament of @entity1 , which is very scary , " said @entity9 , coordinator for the @entity1 @entity10 on @entity11 and @entity12 , an umbrella gay - rights group			1
" we do n't know how brutal the police will be now that the bill has passed			1
with this legitimization , it 's going to get worse			2
" homosexuality is illegal in most @entity23 countries , where sodomy laws were introduced during colonialism			1
currently in @entity1 , homosexual acts are punishable by 14 years to life in prison , according to rights activists			1
but lawmakers in the conservative nation sought tougher legislation , saying the @entity33 lifestyle risks destroying @entity1 family units			0
gay activists in @entity1 are regularly detained , blackmailed and harassed in what they say has been an ongoing campaign led by religious and political leaders in the conservative @entity23 country			1
" what we are convinced and sure of is that nobody can in one 's right conscience and consciousness choose to be homosexual , " said @entity41 , @entity1 's minister for ethics and integrity			2
" this must be under pressure or conditions because we know that the natural tendency is always for a male to go for a female and vice-versa			0
" the moral fervor has even impacted the expatriate community in @entity1			0
a retired @entity58 man is facing up to two years in prison over the possession of a gay sex video			1
the man says the images were stolen along with his laptop in a break - in at his home			2
images from the video were later published in a local tabloid newspaper notorious for outing gays			0
@entity70 , 65 , was scheduled to appear in an @entity72 court last week , but his case has been postponed until january 22			0
@entity70 was arrested and released on bail last month and is charged with " trafficking obscene publications , " which carries a sentence of up to two years			0
his partner , @entity1 @entity77 , was arrested and will stand trial alongside him , facing a more serious charge for " gross indecency , " which carries a sentence of up to seven years			0
" there certainly seems to be a ramping up of pressure from the state here against homosexuals , " said @entity70 , citing a string of arrests and trials against gay activists in recent months			1
" i 'm still very concerned if they drop the case or if i 'm found not guilty			0
" early this year , another @entity58 national , @entity94 , faced up to two years in prison for staging a play with a gay character without government permission			1
though the charges against him were dropped for lack of evidence , he was deported from @entity1 one month later			0
@entity94 has since filed an appeal against his deportation at the @entity104 in @entity1 , but those proceedings have also stalled			0
the bill , which in its original form prescribed the death penalty for cases of " aggravated homosexuality " -- for instance if someone is infected with @entity113 -- was reduced before the vote to life imprisonment			1
clauses that criminalize the " promotion " of homosexuality could cause activists and even doctors treating gay patients with @entity113 to face prison time			1
member of parliament @entity123 praised the bill 's passage on friday , thanking the speaker " for the courage and defending the children of @entity1 and the cause for humanity , to protect our marriages , to defend culture and to defend the future of our children			1
" the @entity136 said in a statement that the bill will have a " disastrous impact on the country 's @entity113 response			2
" @entity1 is one of only two countries in @entity144 with a rising aids rate , after being hailed for its early success in fighting the epidemic in the 1990s			2
president @entity148 still has to assent to the bill for it to become law -- " so our only hope now is with the president of @entity1 -- and we plan to put as much pressure as necessary to ensure that this bill does n't pass into law , " said @entity9 , who is also a winner of the @entity159 's 2011 @entity158			1
to become law , it requires @entity148 's signature within 30 days			1
human rights groups are also on high alert and outspoken about the recent measures			2
" president @entity148 must veto this wildly discriminatory legislation , which amounts to a grave assault on human rights and makes a mockery of the @entity1 constitution , " said @entity165 , deputy @entity144 director at @entity167			1
" passing the @entity174 was a retrograde step for @entity1 's @entity176 , which has made some important progress on human rights in recent years , including criminalizing torture			2
it flies in the face of the @entity1 government 's stated commitment to ensure all legislation complies with human rights			2
" gay activist @entity185 said that he has been verbally and physically attacked since the bill 's passing and that many @entity1 think the bill has already become law			1
the 2011 @entity191 winner told journalists at a news conference in @entity194 monday that gay - rights activists will be challenging the bill in constitutional court			1
the activists say they will contest the lack of a quorum in parliament , which prime minister @entity202 has also noted , saying the @entity203 did not have the necessary number of mps for the bill to be passed			2
according to a parliamentary statement , the prime minister tried to defer consideration of the bill , saying that government was involved in " negotiations " over the proposed legislation			0
" i was not aware that this bill was coming up for debate			0
there are some issues on which we are still consulting , " @entity202 was quoted as saying			0
however the bill has public backing from the parliamentary speaker , @entity221 , who last year had promised to pass the bill as a " christmas gift " to @entity1 , but it was carried into the current session			0
the bill has also brought condemnations from the international community , which could lead to @entity1 losing millions in donor aid			0
last year , @entity229 cut off aid to @entity1 , citing the bill as one of the reasons			0
@entity58 prime minister @entity234 has also threatened to cut aid to @entity1 over the bill			0
@entity237 foreign policy chief @entity236 last week urged the @entity1 government " to ensure respect of the principle of non-discrimination , guaranteed in the @entity1 @entity242 , and to preserve a climate of tolerance for all minorities in @entity1			0
