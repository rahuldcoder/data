-- president @entity1 on sunday used his annual commemoration of @entity3 , the @entity3 , to underscore his administration 's repeated argument that the @entity7 government is on the wrong side of the popular , pro-democracy movement sweeping across the region			1
" we all know that these movements for change are not unique to these last few months , " stated @entity1 in a sunday press release			2
" the same forces that swept across @entity16 were seen in @entity17 in june of 2009			0
" @entity18 's @entity17 was the site of massive anti-government protests following the controversial re-election of @entity7 president @entity22 , for whom , opponents claimed , the contest was rigged			2
pro-government paramilitary forces violently suppressed the demonstration and dozens of people were killed			0
likewise , recent @entity7 protests inspired by the @entity30 and @entity31 revolts have been stymied by force			2
" just as the people of the region have insisted that they have a choice in how they are governed , so do the governments of the region have a choice in their response , " @entity1 stated			2
" so far , the @entity7 government has responded by demonstrating that it cares far more about preserving its own power than respecting the rights of the @entity7 people			1
" with the collapse of autocratic governments in @entity30 and @entity31 and amid the threat pro-democracy uprisings pose to others , the @entity1 administration has repeatedly sought to portray @entity22 's government as a hypocritical and meaner sibling of other repressive and dictatorial @entity53 regimes			1
the @entity54 has accused the @entity7 government of hypocrisy for comparing the @entity31 and @entity58 uprisings to @entity7 's own 1979 @entity60 revolution , while crushing its own protesters			1
in @entity1 's 2011 sunday commemoration of @entity3 , the president addressed only the @entity7 people and not their government			1
the message was also specifically aimed at young people			0
" you , the young people of @entity7 -- carry within you both the ancient greatness of @entity72 civilization , and the power to forge a country that is responsive to your aspirations , " @entity1 stated			1
" and though times may seem dark , i want you to know that i am with you			0
" in 2009 , @entity1 told @entity7 's leaders that his administration was seeking " engagement that is honest and grounded in mutual respect			1
" in 2010 , the president chided the @entity7 government for its violent suppression of peaceful demonstrators			1
" you have refused good - faith proposals from the international community , " @entity1 stated in 2010 , referring to @entity7 's aspirations to develop nuclear power			1
in his 2011 statement , @entity1 never strayed from referring to the @entity7 government in the third person			1
the president excoriated the @entity7 government for waging a campaign of " intimidation and abuse , " including jailing hundreds of activists , silencing journalists , torturing women and sentencing children to death			1
that includes the jailing of human rights defender @entity103 , filmmaker @entity104 and journalist @entity105 , the president said			0
@entity1 also named student @entity106 , who has been sentenced to death " for throwing three stones , " he said			2
" these choices do not demonstrate strength , they show fear			0
for it is telling when a government is so afraid of its own citizens that it wo n't even allow them the freedom to access information or to communicate with each other , " @entity1 stated			1
" but the future of @entity7 will not be shaped by fear			0
the future of @entity7 belongs to the young people -- the youth who will determine their own destiny			2
" @entity3 , which literally means " new day , " marks the first day of spring and the start of the @entity7 year			1
it is celebrated around the start of the vernal equinox			0
it is also considered a holiday for @entity127 as well as adherents of @entity129 and the @entity131 faith			0
@entity54 secretary of state @entity132 on sunday also released a statement marking the @entity3			0
" this year allows us to reflect on recent events in the @entity53			0
we commend the demonstration of peaceful expressions of human rights and dignity we have seen in much of the region , " @entity137 stated			0
" we join the world community in embracing @entity3 's opportunities and in striving to uphold its values			0
" may this new year be filled with a renewed sense of hope and a new commitment to the human rights and fundamental freedoms that are our universal birthright , " @entity137 stated .			0

@entity1 tells @entity7 youth , " i am with you " in @entity3 message
