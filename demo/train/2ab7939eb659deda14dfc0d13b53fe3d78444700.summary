-- if there 's only one @entity4 musician you 've heard of , it 's probably my father : @entity8			1
his innovative musical style and flamboyant showmanship made him famous not just in @entity11 , but throughout the world as he pioneered what became known as @entity14			0
but @entity8 was more than a musician -- he was also a legendary activist , who with many other brave @entity4 was jailed for speaking out			1
one of the great injustices of our time is that some of the poorest people in the world are living on top of some of the @entity24 's richest resources of oil , gas and minerals			1
but rather than benefiting from this wealth , they 're too often being robbed of it			0
in many @entity4 countries , the deals to extract these resources are done in the dark , with no information made available to citizens who deserve to know what their natural riches were sold for , and whether the money went to the national budget , or someone 's @entity40 bank account			1
as world leaders gather for the @entity45 summit in @entity46 , @entity47 , this weekend , it 's time to draw a line in the sand over the corruption that wracks @entity4			1
after all , you do n't have to visit @entity52 or @entity53 to see the disparity between the haves and have - nots			2
indeed , given revelations of government officials from some of @entity4 's poorest countries owning luxury homes in the @entity62 , @entity63 and @entity64 , it is clear we need strong international transparency laws to help ensure such assets are n't purchased with money stolen from public coffers			1
but this is no longer my father 's fight			0
it 's time for the next generation of activists to hold today 's leaders accountable to their people			2
corruption is not just an @entity4 problem ; it 's a global issue			1
in today 's globalized world , where stolen money can be wired instantly from one country to another , we need global action to end corruption			1
after all , it takes two to tango			0
although a corrupt official or business in @entity4 may be the one stealing money , those funds often end up in bank accounts and anonymous shell companies based in supposedly reputable financial centers like @entity96 , @entity97 and @entity98			2
take , for instance , the case of former @entity11 military dictator @entity101			0
during his five - year reign in the 1990s , an estimated $ 3 billion to $ 5 billion of public money went missing			0
it is widely believed that much of that money ended up in bank accounts and shell companies in @entity109 and the @entity63			0
the @entity11 government has spent the past decade trying to find and recover it , with only modest success			0
with this in mind , we need to start by asking powerful countries to stop enabling the flow of ill - gotten spoils from developing nations to their shores			2
@entity122 nations must pull up the welcome mat to criminals and they have a great opportunity to do just that at the upcoming @entity45 summit			1
so what practical steps can the @entity45 take to crack down on corruption ? first , they should require companies to publicize the names of their owners so that anonymous companies can no longer be used to steal the riches of developing countries			1
second , they should endorse mandatory transparency laws for oil , gas and mining companies so citizens can follow the money and hold their governments accountable for the effective use of natural resource wealth			0
and finally , the @entity45 should lead on greater tax transparency for companies , making information publicly available that can be used to ensure that businesses pay their fair share of taxes to governments			2
we can not lose sight of the impact of corruption on real human beings			0
according to @entity159 , nearly $ 1 trillion each year is siphoned out of developing countries through shady deals and money laundering , with sizable amounts of that money ending up in the world 's richest countries and offshore tax havens			0
this money could and should be used to build hospitals , schools , roads and infrastructure necessary to save and improve millions of peoples ' lives			0
for decades , my father , and countless activists whose names history has forgotten , risked their lives to expose corruption and bring people to act , urging them to stand up for justice and human dignity			2
now is the time for world leaders meeting in @entity47 to honor their legacy by tackling the problem of global corruption with smart , meaningful action .			1

many of the poorest people live in resource - rich nations , says @entity193
@entity8 : corruption not just an @entity4 problem ; it 's a global issue
@entity45 should take steps to tackle corruption , says @entity8
