-- on a walk through @entity3 about a decade ago , @entity1 noticed a bird swooping from branch to branch , as if to follow a group of kids walking below			1
maybe it was a trick of the eye , something people see and forget			0
@entity1 , a writer and illustrator , could n't shake it			1
" i thought , ' boy , that 's a good story , ' " he said			1
it was fully formed in his mind : it could be a children 's book			1
the place would be @entity21 , with flashes of @entity23 , @entity3 , even the @entity25 towers			0
the illustrations would be almost monochromatic , all blues and grays			0
the story would be wordless , " of course			1
" it would follow a lonely boy and his bluebird friend through joy and wonder , then fear and loss at the hands of bullies			1
for years , the idea went nowhere			0
@entity1 had other projects and obligations -- books to write , @entity21 covers to draw -- and besides , he was sure nobody would publish it			1
" let me get this straight , " he knew any editor would ask , " the bird dies ? " early drafts of the art drew attention on @entity50 , including the eyes of an editor at @entity53 , an imprint of @entity55			0
" @entity57 " hit bookstore shelves this spring			1
since then , @entity1 has been on the road , " reading " the book to kids and adults -- describing the images , and letting listeners come to their own conclusions about what happens to the bird , boy and bullies			1
wordless picture books have had a big few years			1
several won the @entity70 for picture book artwork , including " @entity72 " in 2012 , " @entity73 " in 2010 and " @entity74 " in 2007			1
even @entity1 , who wrote and illustrated children 's books " @entity77 " and " @entity78 , " was surprised by the details kids spotted in his drawings -- and the variety of ways people interpreted his story			1
" kids are far more intelligent than we give them credit for , " he said from his studio in @entity89 " whether you 're a child or an adult , it 's so universal , it resonates with everyone			1
" between work on magazine covers , newspaper illustrations and a new picture book about a child who has a book for a pet , here 's what @entity1 had to say about " @entity57			1
" @entity0 : you said " of couse " the story would be wordless -- why ? @entity1 : never in the history of children 's literature has a 5 - year - old walked into a bookstore and laid down $ 18 for a picture book			1
these are precious items that are passed down from an adult that has a wallet in his or her pants			0
you have to find a way to resonate with the adult			0
but beyond that , kids look			2
they do n't read a book			2
they look at a book			2
it 's as worthwhile to look at pictures as it is to read words			2
( as a kid ) , i would pull books out of the library , i 'd look at @entity135 and dream about those incredible places			0
i did n't necessarily read the words			0
you can tell his broad story page to page to page by simply having a child inferring			0
it 's a magical thing			2
we should all be so lucky to have a book that 's so open - ended that it 's ripe for interpretations all over the place			1
@entity0 : what do you think of all the ways people have interpreted the book and its ending ? @entity1 : when i read it , i describe what 's occurring on every page			1
( kids ) just go slack - jawed when they see the bird hit by the stick thrown by the bully			2
i say the little bird flies off and disappears by the cloud and you decide what happens			0
" does the bird die ? does the bird fly away ? does the bird go to heaven ? what happens to the boy in the sky ? does he fly up with his friend ? " getting a kid to read a book and ask questions , that 's where we want all these books to be			1
that 's an awesome thing			2
i do n't know what happens at the end of the book , but that does n't matter			2
if people want to see it as a story about @entity194 , that 's great			2
i view it as a story about loss			0
i feel like the book could help families who are dealing with real , painful loss			2
the vast majority of people look at it and they do have their own interpretation , their own personal relationship with it			0
you determine how that book ends			2
@entity0 : even if you see hope in the book , it still tackles pretty heavy themes for a picture book			2
@entity1 : if you 've got your eyes wide open , you remember those less - than - beautiful moments in your childhood , when you were faced with these eye - opening lessons : people can be completely ridiculously obnoxious			1
it can be painful stuff			0
if i was bullied by a kid , they found out i could draw and all of a sudden , i was drawing cartoon characters for them			0
in a lot of ways , people might say " you let them get their way			0
" i let them see what was beyond			0
they could appreciate that i had something that was really unique			0
@entity233 , here i am a 55 - year - old author , i constantly have to think back to 5 , to @entity234 , @entity235 , those lessons i learned as a kid			0
@entity0 : what was it like to create the bullies and show how they changed after they hurt the bluebird ? @entity1 : it 's a tough thing to pull off			1
the bullies could not believe what they did			2
you infer that through the expressions			0
those kids will never , ever bully again -- that 's the way i view it			1
those were really difficult scenes			0
i had to make sure they were remorseful			0
they know they pushed it too far , and they will never do it again			0
they run off in complete shame			0
@entity0 : how did you know kids would get it ? @entity1 : they completely get it			1
i do n't care if i talk to kindergartners or prekindergarten			0
everything that happens in " @entity57 " i went through as a kid			1
there 's no kid who is n't bullied , no kid who does n't encounter kids who are completely irrational , gang mentality , no kid who does n't look in the world , who does n't have these moments of @entity280			1
the best children 's books come from the heart of the author			1
it sounds so trite and ridiculous , but if i ca n't go ahead and pull out from the depths of my childhood that experience that little @entity288 had , it does n't have soul .			0
