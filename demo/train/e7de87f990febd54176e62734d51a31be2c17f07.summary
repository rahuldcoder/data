-- the boy stood out because of the bright blue shirt he was wearing , not for his arms stretched toward the heavens or the look in his eyes that said : i am hungry			2
all the other boys were desperate , too			1
photographer @entity9 looked down at them from the @entity12 military helicopter about to drop food and water			1
she would never know their names but she would tell their story			2
the boy in the blue shirt is one of 20 million @entity12 suffering in a land washed away by massive monsoon flooding			1
aid workers say that media coverage of a disaster helps bring in donations			1
@entity9 , working for @entity26 , and other photographers are attempting to unveil the unfathomable scope of @entity12 's human misery			1
three weeks into the crisis , thousands of homeless packed into makeshift , fly - infested camps			1
they endured the searing summer heat and the ache of their empty bellies			1
they wondered , with more rain on the way , when they might see home again			0
some voiced frustration that aid had not reached them			2
others were downright angry at their own government for perceived failure in a time of national need			0
much of the criticism has been pointed at president @entity52 , who was in @entity53 as the crisis unfolded and was late visiting flood zones			0
@entity52 again left @entity12 wednesday , arriving in the @entity57 town of @entity58 to participate in a four - nation summit with @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity57 , according to the state - run @entity62 of @entity12			1
@entity52 's office has defended the president 's travels as part of his job and called the criticism " venomous propaganda of his opponents			0
" but one thing is clear : @entity52 , leader of a country already coping with poverty and violence , will have to deal with far - reaching consequences of the floods			0
the @entity79 has received less than half of the $ 460 million it needs for relief efforts			0
@entity83 secretary of state @entity85 's office said she would announce more aid thursday on top of the roughly $ 70 million already pledged by @entity89			2
no one knows exactly why the flow of aid money is failing to keep up with the need , though @entity9 , interviewed wednesday on @entity0 , suspected one reason might be the death toll			1
at just over 1,400 , it is low given the scale of the disaster			0
" what usually takes people 's breath away is the sheer number of people who die , " she said			2
" but this is a different kind of disaster			0
" it has been evolving and people 's suffering increased incrementally along with the water that spread from the mountains in the north to the plains of the south			2
aid workers have also said it has been hard to reach people because of continuing rain and damaged or flooded bridges and roads			1
in villages and towns where they were able to get through , people raced trucks carrying relief			1
only the young boys , like the one with the blue shirt , had the energy to keep up , it seemed to @entity9			1
from the back of an aid truck all she could see were a mess of tangled arms forced through open windows			2
others grabbed onto chunks of ice distributed by a local charity			0
another photo showed a woman in a black and pink dupatta ( scarf )			0
her left hand hugged her cheek in despair , her eyes failed to meet the camera 's lens			0
@entity9 snapped a perfect portrait of uncertainty			1
" when you are here , you see how little people have , " @entity9 said			1
" the poorest people have been affected			2
" even when the rescue choppers land or the boats arrived , many @entity12 were reluctant to leave home			1
they depended on the land and their animals to make a living			0
they already lost their crops			0
if they left their livestock behind , they would be leaving with nothing			0
how would they restart life ? but it was only from the air , said @entity9 , that she could see what it meant for one - fifth of the country to be underwater			1
a group of people stood on an island of dry , dusty ground with a handful of ramshackle shelters			2
they were surrounded by water , water and more water			0
the helicopter hovered before dropping bags of flour and 10 - packs of bottled water			0
a man on a rooftop thrashed his arms about for attention			0
no one can afford to be forgotten , to be left behind or left without			0
@entity9 pointed her camera toward people who have nothing			1
the world , she felt , needed to see			0
@entity0 's @entity199 and @entity200 in @entity12 , and @entity201 contributed to this report .			1
