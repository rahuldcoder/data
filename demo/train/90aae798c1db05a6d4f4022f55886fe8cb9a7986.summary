@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity3 had praise saturday for this week 's announcement that scientists had created the world 's first synthetic cell , calling it an " interesting result " that could help cure disease			1
in an article saturday , the @entity3 newspaper @entity11 called it " important research " and " the work of high - quality genetic engineering			1
" but it said the scientists who created the cell had not created life , just " replaced one of its motors			2
" the response may appear to mark a turn for the @entity3 , but in fact the church does not officially oppose genetic engineering as long as the science avoids embryonic stem cells , cloning or anything else that fiddles too much with the re-creation of human life			1
" genetic engineering can do good : it is enough to think that it could heal chromosome - related diseases , " the article said			1
however , scientists must " join courage with caution , " it said			0
" they touch a very fragile territory where the environment and manipulation play a role that can not be underestimated , " the article said			0
genetics pioneer @entity49 , who runs an eponymous @entity51 institute for genomic research , announced thursday that he and his team had created artificial life for the first time			1
using sequences of genetic code created on a computer , the team assembled a complete dna of a bacterium and inserted it into a cell of bacteria			2
the new cell was self - replicating , controlled only by the synthetic genome			0
" the weight of the dna is great , and great are the expectations of genetic science , " @entity11 said			0
" nevertheless , the @entity68 , even though it is an excellent engine , is not life			0
" @entity49 said his team had not created life			1
" we created a new cell			2
but we did n't create life from scratch , " he said			1
@entity49 said the discovery would help give science new tools for a range of applications , from converting carbon dioxide into fuel and creating new food substances to creating new vaccines to treat diseases			2
the breakthrough will stimulate discussion about the possibilities , @entity49 told @entity2			0
he said his next step would be to " see if we can create some of these cures for the planet			0
" @entity2 's @entity96 contributed to this report .			0

@entity49 says he and his team created artificial life for the first time
@entity3 praises announcement , says it could help cure diseases
@entity106 does not oppose genetic engineering that avoids embryonic stem cells , cloning
" we created a new cell . it 's alive . but we did n't create life from scratch , " @entity49 says
