@entity1 @entity0 jumped into the political story of the day late on monday night with a tweet that compared people who deny the power of vaccines to those who question whether the earth is round or the sky is blue			1
@entity11 is the prohibitive favorite for the @entity14 presidential nomination in 2016 and the tweet was seemingly aimed @entity17 presidential hopefuls who have questioned whether vaccinations should be required and whether they are tied to mental disorders			1
@entity11 ends the tweet with a nod to her granddaughter , @entity24 , who was born late last year			2

the issue has become political , despite the fact that claims like vaccines leading to childhood autism have been debunked by scientific research			1

" " i 'm not arguing vaccines are a bad idea			1
i think they 're a good thing			0
but i think the parents should have some input , " he said during an interview on @entity54			0
@entity58 gov. @entity57 , when asked about the issue , said that he choose to vaccinate his children , but added , " parents need to have some measure of choice in things as well , so that 's the balance that the government has to decide			0
