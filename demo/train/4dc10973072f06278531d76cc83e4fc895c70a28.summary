-- @entity0 sent photos of his mother 's traditional @entity4 wedding ceremony			1
@entity0 , 22 , who lives in @entity6 , took the pictures at the wedding of his mother @entity9 to @entity10 at @entity11 in @entity12 in february this year			0
the traditional ceremony is called @entity14 , or wine carrying , because it involves the bride carrying a cup of palm wine to her groom			1
@entity0 said that prior to the ceremony itself the groom must visit the bride 's compound with his father and ask the bride 's father 's permission to marry her			2
in this case , the bride 's brother took the place of her late father			0
on a second visit , when a meal is served , the two fathers must discuss a symbolic price for the bride			1
" the bride 's price is negotiated between the fathers			2
in most cases there is only a symbolic price to be paid for the bride , in addition to other prerequisites such as kola nuts , goats , chicken , wine , " said @entity0			1
" usually it takes more than one evening before the final bride 's price is settled , offering guests from both sides a glamorous feast			2
" another evening is taken up when the settlement is paid , before the day of the ceremony itself			0
describing the wedding day itself , @entity0 said : " the bride 's father fills a cup ( @entity65 ) with palm wine and passes it on to the girl while the groom finds a place between the guests			1
" it is the custom for her to look for her husband while being distracted by the invitees			0
only after she has found the groom , offered the cup to him and he has sipped the wine , is the couple married traditionally			0
" during this ceremony , there is also the nuptial dance where the couple dances , while guests wish the newly weds prosperity by throwing money around them or putting bills on their forehead			0

before a traditional @entity4 wedding can take place , the fathers negotiate a symbolic price for the bride
the bride carries a cup of palm wine to her groom during the ceremony
