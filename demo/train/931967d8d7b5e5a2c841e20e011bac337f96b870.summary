certain products are definitely ok to rent			1
or the cheapest room at a motel 6 when you find yourself strolling down @entity6 at midnight with no pants			2
things are weird at home			1
but a @entity11 - based company caught the internet 's attention this week for renting something completely unexpected : wives			1
yes , the @entity16 might just be as horribly misogynistic as it sounds			2
because it 's pretty much what you think it is : a housekeeping and odd jobs service where renters can choose a " wife " from three pricing tiers , ranging from the @entity24 to the good wife to the @entity25			1
the company 's founder , @entity27 , says most of her clients are actually women			1
so , who the hell knows ? what really matters is that , clearly , if you just surf the @entity35 long enough , you 'll find lots of really weird stuff you can rent			1
alas , when i started googling " rent a ... " followed by each letter of the alphabet ( minus vowels and @entity43 ) to see what would autofill , this is what i found : @entity46 : a self - service garage in @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 is where you can work on your own vehicle with the same professional conveniences of a mechanic			1
it 's a good idea , but there 's also a 100 % chance i would kill both myself and others in the process of changing a spark plug			1
@entity63 : this is a fairly well - known store for rent - to - own furniture and appliances			1
it 's also not a bad rebuilding option for the @entity69			1
rent - a - dreads : this one sort of blew me away , for it has nothing to do with leasing a temporary dreadlock weave like the words might suggest			1
it 's actually a term used in regards to female sex tourism			1
in the @entity80 and @entity81 , male sex workers are often referred to as @entity70			2
in @entity81 , a male sex worker is simply known as " @entity83 with access to @entity85			2
" rent - a - friend : this site claims to have " friends from around the world available for hire , " perfect for anyone who just needs a buddy			1
some of the activities they say people are using @entity95 for are sporting events , wine tasting and hot air balloon rides			2
would you like to ride in a balloon with me ? " " hi			2
no. " @entity103 : this is just what it sounds like			2
you rent a goat and then let it eat unwanted plants and weeds			1
but , really , i just want to get one for my dog			2
" @entity114 , this is goat			0
goat , this is @entity114			0
if you need me , i 'll be inside shopping for friends			0
" rent - a - home : a house leasing company in @entity122 , @entity123 , somehow managed to come up first in my @entity125 search			1
which is n't very exciting			0
but right below it was @entity127			0
their slogan is " for those jobs that never get done ! " which leads me to believe they specialize in renting out alcoholics who like watching football			1
" my @entity127 was just as advertised ! the garbage disposal is still busted , and he left the toilet seat up			0
five stars ! " rent - a - @entity139 : if you live in the @entity142 and need a temporary outdoor toilet that doubles as a sweat lodge , these guys have you covered			1
@entity145 : this is the title of a really bad @entity148 movie from 1995 about a guy who rents out orphans			0
i actually found it on @entity153 and watched the entire thing when i literally could 've been doing anything else with my time			0
like riding in a balloon with @entity100			0
@entity157 : put that coffee down ! this lead generator aims to help people in sales find potential customers to sign on the line that is dotted			0
a ... b ... c ... always be cluttering people 's inboxes			1
rent - a - @entity166 : lacking morals ? having a party ? looking for alternative entertainment ? you 're in luck			1
" @entity173 , i have the perfect idea for @entity176 's bar mitzvah reception ! " @entity177 : back in 2003 , damali ayo -- who , officially , does n't capitalize the first letters of her name -- created this ( now - defunct ) website as a form of " web - art - performance " based around the fact that she felt like a " professional black person " to her white friends			1
through @entity177 , she created a special mock rental form so white people could request services such as touching her hair , teaching them how to dance and speaking with their racist grandmother			0
she eventually turned her art experience into a book called " how to rent a @entity200			1
" because that 's what i need on my shelf			2
@entity204 : this led to several articles about renting animals			0
on that note , my dog is now available for quincea√±eras			0
@entity211 : turns out , this is a term used to describe someone who will shamelessly provide a comment to the media on pretty much any topic			0
usually , this person 's motivation is money and / or exposure			2
rent - a - @entity221 : ruminants are mammals that eat plants and then barf out the cud			1
thus , we have yet another service for renting out goats			2
i wonder if my new friend @entity100 knows about this			0
rent - a - swag : comedian @entity232 portrays the character @entity234 on @entity236 's " @entity235			1
" in the fifth season , he comes up with a business idea for renting expensive clothes to boys in middle school who , because they are still growing , have parents who wo n't buy them nice things			0
we had @entity231 growing up			0
it was called crappy hand - me - downs from my brother			2
@entity250 : this just takes you to a site for textbook rentals			0
when i was in college , i once opened a textbook			0
@entity258 : it appears @entity260 strategically cornered the internet market for when you absolutely , positively need an all - white windowless van			1
they 're perfect for driving slowly down sorority row while breathing heavily			0
@entity268 : this is the " largest rent - to - own custom wheel and tire retailer in the nation			1
i 've been thinking of tricking out my @entity273			0
nothing is more fun than camping in a large round room			0
" @entity278 ! @entity278 ! whee ! no corners ! " so , if you want to rent a yurt lodge somewhere in @entity81 , @entity280 will help get you there			2
because we all want a round room at the end of the day			0
@entity287 : this search leads you to a specifically titled strip from a web comic called @entity291 by @entity292 and @entity293			0
it involves ninjas and jails and monsters			0
kind of like my bris			0
but that 's a long story			2
and i 'm saving it for my balloon ride with @entity100			0
