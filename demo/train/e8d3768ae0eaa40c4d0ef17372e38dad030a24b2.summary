@entity0 -- federal firearms agents in @entity5 cringed every time they heard of a shooting after letting waves of guns pass into the hands of @entity12 drug gangs , some of those agents told a @entity14 committee wednesday			1
it was part of an operation aimed at tracking the flow of weapons across the @entity20 - @entity12 border , but the operation has come under intense criticism since the december killing of a @entity20 @entity24 officer			1
@entity26 , as the program was known , was " a colossal failure of leadership , " said @entity29 , a supervisor at the @entity31 field office of the @entity32			1
when @entity20 rep. @entity33 was wounded and six others were killed in a january assassination attempt in @entity36 , @entity29 said , an agency spokesman told him " that there was concern from the chain of command that the gun was hopefully not a @entity26 gun			1
" another agent , @entity44 , said , " this happened time and time again			0
" " every time there 's a shooting , whether it was mrs. @entity33 or anybody , any time there is a shooting in the general @entity31 area or even in , you know , @entity5 , we 're fearful that it might be one of these firearms , " @entity44 told the @entity47			1
the killings of three people connected with the @entity20 consulate in @entity61 , @entity12 , caused similar anxiety , @entity44 said			2
and a third agent , @entity63 , told lawmakers : " i can not begin to think of how the risk of letting guns fall into the hands of known criminals could possibly advance any legitimate law enforcement interest			2
i hope the committee will receive a better explanation than @entity72 " @entity26 focused on following " straw purchasers , " or people who legally bought weapons that were then transferred to criminals and destined for @entity12			1
but instead of intercepting the weapons when they switched hands , @entity26 called for @entity32 agents to let the guns " walk " and wait for them to surface in @entity12 , according to a committee report			1
the idea was that once the weapons in @entity12 were traced back to the straw purchasers , the entire arms smuggling network could be brought down			2
instead , the report argues , letting the weapons slip into the wrong hands was a deadly miscalculation that resulted in preventable deaths , including that of @entity24 agent @entity26			1
@entity26 was killed last year just north of the @entity12 border in @entity5 after he confronted a group of bandits believed to be preying on illegal immigrants			1
two weapons found near the scene of the killing were traced to @entity26			2
i could n't believe it at first , " @entity26 's mother , @entity100 , said of when she learned that the @entity32 may have let some of the guns used in the attack slip through its fingers			1
@entity26 's family said they want all those involved in his killing and who helped put the weapons in their hands to be prosecuted			0
" we ask that if a government official made a wrong decision , that they admit their error and take responsibility for his or her actions , " @entity112 , @entity26 's cousin and family spokesman , testified			0
the committee 's chairman , @entity125 @entity123 rep. @entity123 , called the operation " felony stupid			1
" as many as 2,000 semi-automatic rifles reached the hands of the cartels as a result , and @entity123 said the top two @entity32 officials were briefed the program regularly			1
assistant attorney general @entity134 testified that the @entity32 never knowingly allowed the sale of assault weapons to straw purchasers , who then transported them into @entity12			1
but @entity123 and other congressmen said the claim was deceiving			0
although it is technically true that straw purchasers did n't cross any weapons into @entity12 , they did transfer them to third parties who did , they said			0
@entity123 also was upset over heavily redacted documents that his committee had received from the attorney general 's office			2
@entity134 said his office was cooperating to the greatest extent possible , given concerns about disrupting the ongoing investigation			0
but @entity134 said he did not know or was not able to answer questions about who authorized the operation			0
" the attorney general has said he wants to get to the bottom of it , " he said			0
speaking before the committee , sen. @entity162 , @entity163 , said that the operation started with the flawed assumption that there was a large arms trafficking network that was operating			0
" that kind of assumption can cause you to start with a conclusion and work backwards , looking for facts that fit the case			0
until you figure out that you 've got the cart before the horse , you 're probably not going to get anywhere , " he said			0
@entity44 said @entity32 supervisors in @entity31 , where the project was based , brushed off several agents ' concerns over letting guns go			2
and @entity63 said that despite evidence that straw purchasers were giving their weapons to cartels , the agency went no further than to do some surveillance			0
" knowing all the while , just days after these purchases , the guns that we saw these individuals buy would begin turning up at crime scenes in the @entity20 and @entity12 , we still did nothing , " he said			2
@entity29 , also criticized the @entity195 in @entity5 for what he described as a tendency not to prosecute arms trafficking cases , and said " toothless " laws against straw buyers made it difficult to recruit low - level operatives as witnesses			0
" with these types of cases , for somebody to testify against members of a cartel where the alternative is seeing a probation officer once a month , they 're going to opt toward not cooperating with the law enforcement authorities , " he said .			0
