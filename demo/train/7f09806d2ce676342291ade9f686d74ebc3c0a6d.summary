-- " @entity5 " gives the @entity1 a shotgun , and the shotgun appears to fire explosive rounds			1
in the first half hour , three people get their heads cut off			2
and you know how throughout @entity11 history there have been witch trials , which historians retroactively consider the result of mass hysteria ? turns out all those witches were actually witches			2
none of these things even comes close to being the kookiest part of the series premiere of " @entity5 , " a crazypants â € ” and entertaining , if you squint â € ” hour of television			1
our critic @entity24 has already weighed in with a look at some of the deeper resonances in the show			1
the goofy , intriguing , timely allegory that is @entity31 's ' @entity5 ' what follows is a handy primer for the show 's insanity : the episode starts in the middle of a @entity39 battle , which you have to admit is not a common starting place for tv shows			1
nor , for that matter , can i think of any other tv show in history that has suddenly introduced an invulnerable @entity48 soldier wearing an " @entity50 " mask			2
and certainly , it 's rare for the protagonist of a tv show to chop off someone 's head in the first three minutes of his show			2
we do n't really know who this guy is yet , except that obviously we do because the title of the show is @entity5 and we all remember @entity64 's @entity63 song			1
after being knocked out and losing a lot of blood during his fight with the @entity68 , @entity63 suddenly wakes up inside of a cave covered in weird cave stuff			1
when he wakes up , a couple of glass jars break			2
one of them contains a snake , and one of them contains a frog			0
this will probably be important later , unless it 's not			0
@entity31 orders ' @entity5 ' pilot from ' @entity83 ' team @entity63 immediately runs into the middle of a road and almost gets hit by not one , but two terribly animated digital cars			1
the second one actually clips him			0
actor @entity90 kind of sells it			1
so , to recap , in the first five minutes , the protagonist of " @entity5 " has decapitated a @entity96 , flash - forwarded 250 years in history , woken up in a cave , and been hit by a car			1
elsewhere in @entity5 , we meet @entity98 , who 's basically playing the same character @entity100 played on the first episode of " @entity102			1
" he fires 12 rounds of ammunition at the @entity1 and gets his head chopped off			0
in one of the night 's many flashbacks , we see @entity63 in a revolutionary war - era infirmary			1
he 's hanging out with his wife , who is a nurse , and also a priest who appears to be immortal			0
but none of that is important right now ! what is important is that they put a @entity115 on @entity63 's body , and in the present day , @entity63 finds it and flips right to the @entity117 and decides that the @entity1 is the @entity118 of the @entity119			1
and they keep on reading revelations throughout the episode to get clues about stuff			0
so basically , the @entity117 is to " @entity5 " as @entity125 is to " the following			1
" so excited for the " @entity126 " musical episode ! also , @entity128 is in this tv show			2
although he only appears in flashbacks that are shot like re-enactments on " @entity133			0
" anyhow , all you have to know is that the pilot of " @entity5 " features the line " the answers are in @entity138 's @entity115 ! " so it 's basically " @entity140 " meets " @entity141 " meets " @entity142			1
" remember that immortal priest i mentioned ? turns out that he 's telekinetic or whatever ! he tries to hold off the @entity1 using his brain to control chains , but the @entity148 cuts through them with his axe , which i should mention is heated to 500 degrees			0
this priest also gets decapitated			0
trailers for the new @entity153 2013 tv shows we should mention @entity63 's new partner , @entity155			1
when we meet her , she initially seems like an everywoman police officer			0
she is also the source of most of the pilot 's self - mocking exposition , including the immortal line , " so the killer is the @entity118 of the @entity119 , and the proof is a @entity115 we found in a cave			2
" but it turns out that she has a crazy history			2
when she was young , she and her sister were wandering through the forest , when suddenly they saw four white trees , which represent the @entity171 probably , because numbers			0
they also saw a strange creature			0
( it turns out that @entity98 was investigating this and many other mysteries before he died , and basically " @entity5 " is " @entity179 " plus " @entity180			1
" ) it also turns out that @entity63 's wife is a witch who is currently residing in some weird dimension in the forest that looks like @entity187 in " @entity188			1
" she 's a good witch , though , and she 's trying to stop the apocalypse , but there 's a group of bad witches who are trying to cause the apocalypse			0
somewhere , the decapitated head of @entity196 is rolling his eyes			0
right about the time that the @entity1 starts firing a shotgun , you 're probably thinking to yourself , " certainly the only thing sillier than this would be that the shotgun appears to be shooting fireworks			0
" gentlemen , your chariot has arrived			0
the fireworks do n't hit anyone , because this is broadcast tv and you ca n't show anyone getting shot , although you can show three decapitations			2
@entity212 appears in the pilot episode as a duplicitous cop who is a witch or whatever , and is mostly just there to remind you how much you liked @entity212 's character arc in " @entity218			0
" he gets killed by some kind of strange creature who appears in the mirror and is basically the devil , probably			0
also , the @entity1 's horse has red eyes			0
spooky ! so there 's no way the show can possibly maintain this momentum week - to - week , unless at the end of episode 4 , @entity11 launches its nuclear arsenal at the @entity234 in order to destroy an attacking horde of bat - people			1
but i would watch the heck out of that show			2
