@entity0 -- a brief respite from the violence in @entity0 appeared imminent wednesday after both sides agreed to a u.n - requested temporary cease - fire			1
" factions of the resistance have agreed to accept the offer of the @entity12 regarding a ' field calm ' for 5 hours from 10 am until 3 pm ( local time ) thursday for humanitarian needs , " @entity7 spokesman @entity6 said in a text message			1
@entity16 had already accepted the proposal ; however , the military warned it would not sit idle if attacked			1
" should the humanitarian window be exploited by @entity7 or other terror organizations for the purpose of launching attacks against @entity16 civilian or military targets the @entity19 will respond firmly and decisively , " the @entity19 said in a statement			1
an effort to permanently stop the killing stalled tuesday when @entity16 resumed airstrikes following a brief , one - sided cease - fire brokered by @entity29			1
while @entity16 paused for six hours , @entity7 leaders rejected the deal and continued firing rockets			1
they said they had not been consulted , and complained the deal did not address their demands for greater freedom for @entity0 's 1.8 million residents			2
" the initiative is no longer acceptable , and there is no basis for the continuation of this initiative , " @entity7 spokesman @entity6 had told @entity1			2
children on beach killed anger is rising over civilian deaths -- including those of four children killed while playing on the beach			2
the boys , ages 9 to 11 , died wednesday when a shell from an @entity16 gunship exploded near them at the @entity55 refugee camp in northern @entity0 , according to @entity57 officials			1
an @entity16 official said the shelling was another example of @entity7 using civilians as human shields -- intimating that the boys had been left to play near a rocket launcher			1
" what they are deliberately doing is seeking to kill as many @entity57 as possible in order to yell to the world to , ' help us , ' " @entity16 @entity65 member @entity64 told @entity1			2
" this is cynical and this is cowardly			0
" a @entity7 official , however , called the shelling by an @entity16 gunship a " massacre " and a " war crime " and demanded @entity12 action			1
" those children were not firing rockets , they were just playing , " @entity7 spokesman @entity6 told reporters			1
@entity16 's military said it was aware of the report and was investigating			1
the military , spokesman @entity86			0
gen. @entity87 said , never intentionally targets civilians			2
" based on preliminary results , the target of this strike was @entity7 terrorist operatives			1
the reported civilian causalities from this strike are a tragic outcome , " the @entity19 said in a statement			0
" we 're checking it out because we do n't target civilians			1
we do n't target children			2
there 's obviously been a mistake , " @entity16 government spokesman @entity100 told @entity1 's " @entity103 with @entity104			2
" the incident inflamed already raw emotions over civilian deaths in @entity0 , where at least 221 @entity57 have died and close to 1,600 have been injured since @entity16 began its anti-hamas military operation july 7 , according to @entity57 health officials			1
the one fatality on the @entity16 side so far occurred monday when a mortar shell hit a man at the @entity116 border crossing , @entity16 rescue services said			2
rejection of @entity29 efforts also wednesday , @entity7 declined to join talks in @entity119 between @entity29 president @entity120 and @entity122 president @entity121			2
like @entity16 , @entity29 considers @entity7 a terror organization because of the group 's roots in the @entity126 , which @entity29 's military - led government banned after the country 's 2013 coup			1
@entity7 officials said they are not opposed to a cease - fire , but want to see a broad agreement that would , among other things , end restrictions on border crossings that they say are choking the life out of @entity0 's 1.8 million residents			1
" i think what they want is to see a cease - fire agreement that addresses the real problems that they face and the system of violence that is this siege , that is the occupation , so that it can be a genuine cease - fire agreement that brings an end to hostilities , not just from one side , " @entity151 , executive director of the @entity152 , a @entity153 think tank , told @entity1 's " @entity155			0
" but @entity16 prime minister @entity156 said that @entity7 had brought the continued @entity16 operation on itself after rejecting the @entity29 - brokered cease - fire			1
" we held our fire for six hours and during that time , @entity7 continued to barrage our cities with rockets , " @entity156 said			1
" @entity7 thus shut the door to a diplomatic solution , and it therefore bears sole the responsibility for the continuation of the violence			2
" former @entity122 foreign minister @entity168 said @entity7 has legitimate complaints about how @entity16 has implemented past accords			1
" @entity0 is still fully under siege			2
and none of the agreements that have been signed before have been implemented , " he told @entity1 's @entity104			0
" but we think this is something that can be discussed later			0
what we should do now is proceed to an immediate stop of the @entity16 attack on @entity0 and , therefore , an immediate cease - fire			1
and we are working very hard to make that happen as soon as possible			0
" ' we are in jail here ' both palestinians and @entity16 say they are living in fear			2
" we are forced to live in this , and there is nothing for us to do , " said @entity186 , a , 21 - year - old member of @entity187 , one of the groups that is firing rockets at @entity16			0
" the children are scared , but we struggle to continue our lives			0
" the @entity197 neighborhood of @entity0 , where @entity186 lives , was like a ghost town wednesday			0
many people had fled during the night			0
at the @entity55 , 65 - year - old @entity200 said , " we are in jail here , big jail			0
" in the @entity16 city of @entity206 , less than 15 kilometers ( less 10 miles ) from the @entity0 border , people live under the constant threat of rocket fire			1
" it 's a difficult situation , " said @entity209 , a resident of the city			0
" i know that @entity0 has a difficult situation also			0
we feel for them , we feel for them			0
but you ca n't live in your own country and someone will bomb you all the time , it 's not a normal situation			0
" @entity0 crisis : who 's who in @entity7 people on both sides of the conflict " deserve to live in peace and security , free from fear , " president @entity223 told reporters wednesday			1
he said the @entity231 will continue to encourage diplomatic efforts to reach a cease - fire			0
' failure is not an option ' the failed cease - fire took shape after a secret telephone call between @entity29 's @entity120 and @entity156 coordinated by @entity240 peace envoy @entity239 , the @entity16 newspaper @entity241 reported wednesday , citing unnamed diplomatic sources			0
the @entity29 plan calls for all sides to cease hostilities in @entity0 , the opening of border crossings and for high - level talks among those involved			0
the deal was " prepared hastily " without consulting all the parties involved , most notably @entity7 , @entity241 reported , citing @entity253 and @entity16 diplomatic sources			1
the effort to find a new path to a cease - fire is a " must for all of us , " said @entity259 , chief negotiator for the @entity122			0
" failure is not an option here , " he said			0
@entity231 secretary of state @entity263 said the immediate need is to find a way to stop the violence			0
" our concern is to have a legitimate cease - fire and see if we can find a way to stop the conflict killing so we can get to the real issues that are underlying it , " he said			0
" and we 're doing everything in our power			0
" @entity16 military 's ' knock on roof ' warnings criticized by rights groups war - scarred @entity0 medical crews also in harm 's way opinion : a smart way out of the @entity0 confrontation @entity1 's @entity286 and @entity287 reported from @entity0 , and @entity288 reported and wrote from @entity289			1
@entity1 's @entity290 , @entity291 , @entity292 , @entity293 , @entity294 , @entity295 , @entity296 , @entity297 and @entity298 also contributed to this report .			0
