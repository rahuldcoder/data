-- @entity1 , the nation 's largest cable provider , wants to acquire @entity3 , the nation 's second - largest cable provider			1
should we be concerned ? i certainly am ; that 's why i oppose this deal			0
and i 'm not alone			0
more than 100,000 people -- including many from my own state of @entity12 -- have written to me expressing frustration that they are already paying significantly higher prices for increasingly poor cable and broadband service			1
many note that they are unable to get a better deal because , where they live , there is only one viable option ( in @entity12 , it 's usually @entity1 )			1
and they worry that this deal will only make things worse			0
@entity1 takes merger case to @entity28 @entity1 dismisses these concerns by pointing out that it does not directly compete with @entity3 in any zip code -- as if that 's supposed to reassure us			1
but the fact that the two biggest cable companies have already effectively managed to carve the country up into local monopolies should n't make us feel any better about their plan to become one giant company			1
indeed , it 's a clear sign that the cable market needs more competition , not less			2
as for satellite tv and wireless internet providers -- which @entity1 would have you believe are forcing it and @entity3 to band together in an uphill battle for survival -- they simply do n't represent real competition			1
@entity1 grilled in @entity51 over merger plans you can get your tv from a satellite provider , but it usually wo n't come with high - speed broadband internet			1
and wireless internet is not a viable substitute for broadband -- particularly if you want to watch tv online			2
essentially , if you want both tv service and high - speed internet , you are stuck with a big cable and broadband company like @entity1 or @entity3 -- " or " being the appropriate preposition here , because , as @entity1 brags , many @entity67 already have just one of these companies to choose from where they live			1
and if this deal goes through , @entity1 will become the only option for millions more consumers			2
the danger in allowing @entity1 to accrue even more power is not purely hypothetical			2
the company is already using its dominant position to dictate terms to content providers seeking to reach its 20 million customers			0
take @entity81 , for example			0
@entity1 , which happens to have a rival video streaming service of its own , was able to exploit @entity81 's growing popularity by refusing to provide the network infrastructure needed to keep @entity81 streaming smoothly			2
in the end , @entity81 had to pay @entity1 an undisclosed amount of money to get direct access to @entity1 's broadband network and alleviate the slowdown			1
as @entity81 ceo @entity101 wrote , " some big @entity93 are extracting a toll because they can -- they effectively control access to millions of consumers and are willing to sacrifice the interests of their own customers to press @entity81 and others to pay			0
" " extracting a toll " is a polite way of putting it ; this is nothing short of extortion			0
and acquiring @entity3 would give @entity1 millions more customers to use as leverage			1
if @entity1 is able to effectively charge popular providers extra for access to broadband customers , those costs will inevitably be passed on to consumers themselves			1
and if @entity1 is able to determine what traffic can make it into consumers ' homes , content not owned by @entity1 could become harder to find online			2
when the @entity118 recently met to review the proposed acquisition , @entity1 -- which is represented by 107 lobbyists , including several who have passed through the ever - revolving door between the company and the agencies charged with regulating it -- promised to forgo such behavior			2
but the company 's own actions have already proven that such promises are not to be believed			0
for example , three years ago , when @entity1 announced plans to acquire @entity133 , i and others raised concerns about vertical integration : @entity1 already owned the pipes through which cable programming flowed , and now it would own @entity133 's programming , including @entity133 , @entity140 , @entity141 , @entity142 , @entity143 , and others -- more than 20 networks in all			1
@entity146 : blocking @entity1 - @entity3 will not fix @entity67 's internet monopoly as a nod to these concerns , the @entity148 required as a condition of the deal that @entity1 " neighborhood " -- or group -- cable channels into categories , so that programming not owned by @entity1 would n't be relegated to the far reaches of the dial where viewers would be unlikely to find it			1
but once the acquisition went through , @entity1 did n't comply with this condition			2
it refused to put rival @entity163 in the same " neighborhood " as its own news channels , @entity140 and @entity141 -- a textbook example of the kind of anti-competitive behavior we warned about , and in which @entity1 promised not to engage			0
as another condition , @entity1 was told by the @entity148 to create a stand - alone broadband product -- one that was n't bundled with a cable tv package -- so that people who wanted to ditch their cable plans in favor of online services like @entity179 and @entity81 would have an option			1
indeed , @entity1 did create such a product			0
one small problem : it failed to tell customers about it			0
and after receiving complaints , the @entity148 fined @entity1 for failing to live up to this obligation			0
now @entity1 plans to expand its empire by gobbling up the second - largest company in the cable market ( and third - largest in broadband ) , a move that , as even @entity1 's executive vice president admits , could mean that rates will rise at an even faster pace			1
not to mention worse service -- and a threat to the free flow of information in @entity67			0
that 's why i will continue to make the case against this deal			0
and i hope that , @entity1 's outsized political influence notwithstanding , regulators at the @entity148 and the @entity204 will listen			0
join us on @entity208 / @entity207 .			0

sen. @entity210 says *pending* merger between @entity1 and @entity3 is bad for @entity67
the two biggest cable companies , he argues , have already carved country into local monopolies
@entity210 : *takeover* could *negatively* impact internet access ; @entity1 controls much of broadband market
