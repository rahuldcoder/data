@entity0 -- @entity3 @entity2 stripped food stamp provisions opposed by conservatives and narrowly passed scaled back legislation on thursday to overhaul the nation 's farm programs			1
@entity9 chastised the @entity2 for ignoring initiatives they argue poor @entity12 need to keep from going hungry			2
the vote was 216 - 208 and no @entity14 voted for it			0
twelve republicans opposed the bill			0
debate on the floor was raucous and @entity9 several times angrily screamed at @entity2 and accused them of dismissing the needs of low income @entity12			2
" you have removed food stamps ... from this legislation			1
i do n't know where it is going to go			0
it looks like it is going to die a slow death			0
what is it about poor people that you do n't like ? " @entity38 said to @entity3 republicans			1
@entity9 decried the decision to discard a bipartisan framework and instead move forward with a vote only on sections of the bill focused on farm supports			2
republicans pledged a vote at a later time on legislation focused on nutrition and the food stamp program , which is the largest domestic safety net against hunger			0
food stamps cover more than 47 million people , nearly half children , according to the @entity54			1
but escalating costs are a problem for conservatives as has been the program 's continued expansion under the @entity61 and @entity62 administrations			0
the food stamp and nutrition program costs roughly $ 78 billion annually with participation rising sharply in recent years partly due to recession and the sluggish economic recovery marked by high unemployment			1
food stamps account for much of the farm bill 's overall cost			1
many republicans from rural states argued it was important now for @entity75 to address agricultural programs because farmers needed to plan			0
" farms and families in this country need the certainty of this agricultural policy and i ask that you support the bill , " @entity78 said			0
the legislation overhauls federal agricultural policy by consolidating a number of farm programs and ending direct payments to farmers while expanding crop insurance provisions			0
the @entity93 passed farm legislation last month that included the food stamp program and some lawmakers pointed out that @entity3 - @entity93 negotiations to craft a compromise could still include the initiative in a final package			1
but @entity9 said there was no guarantee the @entity3 would ever vote on food stamps as part of farm legislation , and suggested @entity2 leaders lured support from conservatives for thursday 's vote by also promising to make deep cuts to nutrition programs in the future			1
the @entity3 issued a veto threat on the new @entity2 version of the bill on wednesday			1
for decades farm bills have been approved by @entity75 with fairly significant bipartisan support because they include both agricultural programs backed by those representing rural districts and nutrition assistance programs supported by those in urban areas			2
but a bipartisan alliance fell apart in the @entity3 , which defeated a previous version of the farm bill last month			1
@entity9 then said proposed cuts were too severe and also protested additional work requirements for nutrition assistance programs			0
republicans voted against the measure because they argued food stamp cuts were n't steep enough			0
@entity2 leaders scrambled to find a strategy that would get farm legislation through before rural state members go home next month and have to face disappointed farm communities			2
splitting the measure in two pieces was the way to set aside conservatives concerns			0
@entity2 @entity143 chairman @entity142 said he could n't guarantee that a nutrition - only package could pass the @entity3 , but he pledged to democrats he would work with them to ensure those programs continued and were funded .			1
