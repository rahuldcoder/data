twice - convicted murderer @entity0 is set to be executed in @entity2 on tuesday night despite pleas from human rights groups and legal representatives who say his intellectual disability should make him ineligible for the death penalty			1
@entity0 has an iq of approximately 70 and the " emotional capacity of a young boy , " said his attorney , @entity11			1
federal law stemming from a 2002 @entity14 case that went to the @entity16 @entity15 says executing intellectually disabled individuals violates the @entity19 's ban on cruel and unusual punishment			0
but the case also allows states to define intellectual disability			1
in @entity2 , that means attorneys for death row inmates have to prove mental impairment " beyond a reasonable doubt			1
" " this is the strictest standard in any jurisdiction in the nation , " @entity11 said			0
@entity0 's execution would come two weeks after the state executed @entity34 , a @entity35 veteran suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder who killed @entity40 deputy @entity38 in 1998			2
@entity11 also was @entity34 's counsel			0
@entity11 , who has represented @entity0 for 20 years , said in any other state , @entity0 would be serving a life sentence			2
@entity0 was sentenced to death in 1990 for killing fellow prison inmate @entity44 , beating him to death with a nail - studded board			1
at the time , @entity0 had been serving a life sentence for the 1985 shooting death of his girlfriend @entity49			1
" we acknowledge that mr. @entity0 should be held accountable for his actions and behavior , " @entity50 , president of the @entity51 , said in a letter written on @entity0 's behalf			2
" however , it is our contention that mr. @entity0 , who has an intellectual disability , should not be subject to capital punishment			1
" the @entity51 is a nonprofit organization that advocates for and serves people with intellectual and developmental disabilities			0
@entity0 also has the support of the @entity65 , the @entity66 and former president @entity67 and his wife , @entity68			2
the victim 's family and former jurors have also expressed support for mercy in @entity0 's case , saying they were n't given the option of life without parole when sentencing him to death			0
@entity11 said seven doctors agree that his client is intellectually disabled , including three doctors for the state who initially evaluated @entity0 and said he did n't meet @entity2 's standard			1
@entity11 said those doctors have since signed an affidavit admitting they felt rushed during @entity0 's examination and now believe he does meet the standard for " intellectually disabled			0
" in previous clemency hearings , attorneys for the state have argued that @entity0 served in the @entity91 , held a job and managed his money before killing his girlfriend -- signs that he did n't necessarily meet the legal standard for intellectually disabled , even though he has a low iq			1
but @entity11 said examples of @entity0 achieving " self - sufficiency " do n't make a strong case for his execution			0
several of the letters supporting @entity0 's clemency cite last year 's @entity15 decision that struck down a @entity106 law that used " unscientific standards for determining intellectual disability " for death row inmates			1
attorneys tried to use the @entity111 v. @entity106 decision as grounds to spare the life of @entity2 inmate @entity115 , who was sentenced to death for the murder of a local sheriff 's deputy			2
@entity115 , who also had an iq of 70 , was executed in december			0
@entity0 's case was presented monday before the @entity120			0
a statement from the board said it " will make a decision prior to the scheduled execution , " which is set for 7 p.m. tuesday .			0

@entity0 was convicted of murdering a girlfriend and a fellow inmate
hill has iq of " approximately 70 , " his attorney says
in @entity2 , inmates must prove intellectual disability " beyond a reasonable doubt "
