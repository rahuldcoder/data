for years , chocolate , jewelry and flowers have been @entity4 staples			2
however , many consumers are now giving gifts that not only say i love you , but also help those in need			0
recently , the concept of giving back through consuming gained traction with @entity14 shoes , the company that makes the popular slip - on shoes and donates a pair to a child in need for every pair sold			2
@entity14 seemed to open the door for other socially conscious brands , ones that make a difference through product sales			1
now , many entrepreneurs are opening businesses and nonprofit organizations that produce socially conscious goods			0
from backpacks that provide an education to jewelry that empowers women to crocheted goods that help people rise out of poverty , here are three socially conscious companies that are trying to change the world with their products			1
buy a backpack , fund an education in @entity44 @entity45 traveled to @entity44 to climb @entity46 in 2008			1
" i always had this dream of climbing each continent 's highest summit			0
one of my buddies called me and asked if i wanted to climb @entity46 , the highest peak in @entity52			0
it was my first opportunity to check one of those seven summits off the list , " says @entity45			2
little did he know , reaching the peak would inspire him to pursue an even loftier goal			0
@entity45 realized that his success on the mountain would have been impossible without the help of the porters who carried his extra gear , prepared his meals and ultimately guided him to the summit			2
as @entity45 descended the mountain , he discovered that his porters made less than a dollar a day -- an amount he later learned was not nearly enough to put a child in @entity44 through school			1
after returning to the @entity72 , @entity45 made it his mission to provide education opportunities for underserved communities			1
he started stone + cloth , a backpack company that donates part of its profits to support children 's education in @entity44			1
" i decided to make backpacks to create a symbol linking my mountaineering trip with education			1
i kept thinking about how i used a backpack for school as a kid and wanted to create a tool for people to use to spread the word about educating those in need			0
" all stone + cloth backpacks are made in @entity96 , with $ 10 from every backpack purchased going directly to its partner in @entity44 , the @entity99			1
together with the @entity99 , stone + cloth supports education programs , including tuition assistance , school meals , and school supplies -- the learning essentials			2
" by purchasing a backpack our customers carry an education , " says @entity45			1
beads of hope help women in @entity114 @entity115 traveled to @entity114 in the summer of 2007 to volunteer			1
she began working with women at an after - school program and quickly learned about the hardships they faced after years of conflict in the region			2
while getting to know the women , @entity115 was introduced to jewelry they made from paper beads			2
" they showed me this beautiful product but told me they were n't able to sell it			0
in @entity114 [ the jewelry made from paper beads ] is looked down on , " says @entity115			1
the women at the school taught @entity134 how to make the paper beads and asked her to sell the jewelry for them in the @entity72			1
@entity134 agreed to purchase a box from them and try to sell some pieces when she got back home			0
the jewelry sold quickly and inspired @entity115 to team up with her friends @entity142 , @entity143 , @entity144 and @entity145 to create the company 31 bits			1
in august of 2008 , the five traveled to @entity114 and started purchasing jewelry from six women , promising to employ them for at least two years			1
@entity115 stayed in @entity114 in order to oversee operations while @entity142 , @entity153 , @entity144 and @entity145 traveled back to the @entity72 to spread brand awareness			2
through its success , 31 bits has been able to hire more women and launch programs for its @entity114 employees that include @entity161 lessons , health education , and business development programs			1
more than 100 @entity114 women now participate in 31 bits programs , and the company reports it has raised more than $ 500,000 for women it employs through product sales			1
programs provide participants the skills they need to support their families and communities , allowing the company " to empower women to be self - sufficient			0
" @entity177 empowers women in @entity114 , @entity179 @entity180 was inspired to create the nonprofit organization @entity181 after traveling to @entity114 in the summer of 2006			1
@entity180 met a group of refugees who for 20 years had depended on government and aid organizations for food and protection as a result of war			0
when @entity180 returned , he brought with him a message that he passed on to his two childhood friends			0
the refugees he met were tired of handouts			0
they wanted to have jobs and provide for themselves			0
@entity180 's friends took this message to heart and the three decided to act			0
together , @entity180 , @entity199 and @entity200 set out to provide the tools , knowledge and opportunities needed to enable @entity114 refugees to better their circumstances ; but first they had to figure out how			2
years earlier , while still in high school , the three had made extra money crocheting hats			1
" [ we ] sold them to friends of ours who were skiers and snowboarders in the @entity214			0
and it was the one thing we knew that we could [ teach ] people and even provide a job for in the process , " @entity199 explains			0
the group traveled to @entity114 in 2007 and taught 10 women to crochet			1
@entity180 , @entity199 and @entity200 sold the hats in the @entity72 , providing income for the women they employed			0
the company 's success has allowed for expansion of programs into @entity179 ; they currently employ more than 150 women in the two countries			0
more than 250,000 hats have been sold , with each one personally signed by its creator			0
as a nonprofit , @entity181 has been able to raise $ 5 million , which has gone to teaching and empowering the women in its programs and allowing them to rise above poverty			2
@entity242 + cloth , 31 bits , and @entity181 provide three different ways consumers can show their love for that special someone while making the world a better place			1
by informing themselves about companies ' social policies and programs , consumers can channel their purchasing power to make an impact .			0
