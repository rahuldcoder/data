president @entity2 has decided to nominate sen. @entity1 to be the next secretary of state and could make a formal announcement as early as next week , a @entity0 who spoke to @entity1 told @entity5 saturday			1
the expected nomination follows @entity9 ambassador @entity8 's decision to withdraw her name from consideration for the post			1
she dropped out of the running thursday after weeks of criticism from @entity15 about statements she made about the september 11 , 2012 , attack on the @entity20 mission in @entity21 , @entity22 , which left four @entity20 dead , including ambassador @entity23			1
if confirmed by the @entity24 , @entity1 would replace current secretary of state @entity25 , who plans to leave her post within the administration			1
@entity1 , the senior senator from @entity28 and the @entity30 's 2004 presidential nominee , is noted for the experience , gravitas and relationship - building skills that could help him succeed as the @entity20 ' top diplomat			1
sen. @entity35 , @entity36 , recently jokingly referred to @entity1 as " mr. secretary			1
" sizing up @entity1 as secretary of state in his current role as chairman of the @entity41 , @entity1 has traveled the globe on behalf of the @entity2 administration to mend frayed relationships			1
most notably he has traveled to @entity45 after a series of incidents , including the raid that killed @entity50 leader @entity49 , that had set relations back			0
@entity2 's @entity53 : who 's in , who 's out ? world travel is second nature to @entity1 , 69			1
born in @entity58 , he spent much of his childhood overseas , living in @entity60 before going to a @entity62 boarding school at age 11			0
after graduating from @entity64 in 1966 , @entity1 was deployed to @entity65 as a lieutenant in the @entity67			2
@entity1 served as a gunboat officer on the @entity69 , earning the @entity70 , the @entity71 and three @entity72			2
upon his return home in the early 1970s , @entity1 gained public recognition as the head of the group @entity76 and for his anti-war testimony before the @entity41			1
jockeying begins for @entity24 seat in 1972 , @entity1 ran his first campaign , a losing effort for a congressional seat in @entity28			2
he eventually entered politics in 1982 as lieutenant governor under gov. @entity85			0
two years later , @entity1 won the @entity87 seat he has held for five consecutive terms			2
the @entity65 experience came back to haunt @entity1 during the 2004 presidential election			2
a @entity15 - funded group called " @entity92 " aired campaign ads accusing @entity1 of lying to receive two of his five combat decorations and criticizing his anti-war activism			2
incumbent president @entity97 won the @entity99 vote 292 to 252 and racked up 3 million more votes than @entity1			0
@entity35 , @entity101 , @entity2 and the politics of personality after winning his fifth @entity24 race in 2008 , @entity1 took over the @entity41 the following january			1
if nominated by the president and confirmed by his colleagues in the @entity24 , @entity1 would leave @entity107 , and @entity108 , @entity28 ' @entity30 governor , would appoint a replacement			0
by state law , a special general election is required to take place 145 to 160 days after a vacancy occurs			0
so if @entity1 were nominated , confirmed , and then stepped down on january 21 ( @entity115 ) , the election would take place between june 14 and june 29 , with primary elections being held six weeks earlier			0
whoever wins the special election would serve the final year and a half of @entity1 's term and would then be able to run again for a full six - year term in office in the 2014 midterm elections			0
@entity108 says it 's too soon to say whether he 'll name a caretaker or appoint someone who would run in the special election			0
but a @entity30 strategist in @entity28 says @entity108 is under pressure to avoid naming a caretaker , in hopes of preventing a divisive primary			0
the strategist told @entity5 that both rep. @entity134 and rep. @entity135 have already separately met with @entity108 to ask for the appointment if @entity1 's seat does open up .			0
