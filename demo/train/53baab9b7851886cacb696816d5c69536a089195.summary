@entity0 -- @entity3 chairman @entity2 demanded wednesday that the @entity4 turn over records of more than five years of communications with the @entity7 -- a move that significantly expands the @entity11 @entity10 's ongoing probe of alleged federal targeting of conservative groups			1
in a letter to @entity4 chairman @entity15 -- a @entity16 -- @entity2 cited @entity1 reporting on monday that raises " the prospect of inappropriate coordination between the @entity7 and the @entity4 about tax - exempt entities			1
" among other things , @entity2 asked for records of all communications between the @entity7 and the @entity4 dating back to the start of 2008			1
he also requested records of any @entity4 discussions relating to tax - exempt applications or organizations since 2008			0
the letter was co-signed by @entity31 rep. @entity30 , a prominent member of @entity2 's panel			1
@entity4 vice-chair says email raises questions of improper contact with @entity7 iss'a letter came after @entity38 , the vice chairman of the @entity4 and a @entity10 , told @entity1 that he saw an e-mail from an @entity4 investigator to @entity41 , the former head of the @entity7 division responsible for reviewing applications from various groups for tax - exempt status			1
the investigator asked @entity41 , herself a former @entity4 employee , to discuss the status of the @entity49 , a conservative political advocacy group			0
@entity38 noted that after @entity41 was contacted , the @entity7 sent a questionnaire to the @entity49			0
@entity41 , the figure at the center of the congressional investigation into alleged @entity7 targeting of conservative groups seeking tax - exempt status , invoked her @entity57 right against self - incrimination when called to testify before @entity2 's panel in may			1
" dealing with @entity41 is probably out of the ordinary , " @entity38 said , stressing that @entity4 commissioners had not given their staffers permission to reach out to the @entity7 on the matter , a step typically required for such inquiries			2
last week , @entity31 congressional investigators disclosed several e-mails between @entity41 and an @entity4 attorney inquiring about the status of both the @entity49 and another conservative outfit , the @entity70			2
@entity7 , @entity2 escalate fight over investigation @entity2 's letter identifies the @entity4 attorney as @entity75 , an official in the commission 's office of the general counsel			1
the e-mails between @entity75 and @entity41 were initially uncovered by @entity80 chairman @entity79 , @entity81 , who sent a letter last week to acting @entity7 commissioner @entity83 requesting additional details about the controversial contact			2
while the prospect of potential @entity4 involvement with the @entity7 raises the prospect of a broader federal targeting effort , @entity86 continue to insist there is no conspiracy , and stress that the publicly released contact between the two agencies was nothing more than requests for information already in the public domain			2
@entity38 told @entity1 , however , that additional e-mails he has seen do not clearly state whether the @entity4 was only seeking public data			2
requesting private data would likely violate federal law			0
for her part , @entity15 told @entity1 monday she does not know about the e-mails between the @entity4 investigator and @entity41 to which @entity38 is referring			0
" if there was any evidence or targeting based on ideology , that would be extremely serious , but i have not seen any evidence of that , " she said			0
" i am not aware of requesting or receiving any confidential taxpayer information			0
i am not aware of any requests for anything that was n't publicly available			0
" @entity2 wants the @entity4 to turn over the records no later than august 21			1
