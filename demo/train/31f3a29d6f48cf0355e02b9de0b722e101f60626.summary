-- " be as paranoid as possible ! " the screed from our homeowner association manager arrived in our mailbox printed inside a cheery holiday border			2
the message continued : " our neighborhood is as safe as we make it			2
make no mistake about it , you must be on your guard ! report suspicious behavior or individuals that do not belong in our community			0
" the call to arms echoed the strident sentiment of neighbors left nervous by the robbery of our home the day before			0
while we slept unaware at the back of an upscale gated community in @entity27 , @entity28 , intruders came through the front door , took our big - screen tv , laptops and all of the presents from under the christmas tree			1
no matter that we had n't activated our security system and most likely forgot to lock the door			0
hysterical efforts to fortify the perimeter were in full swing			2
an 8 - foot iron fence was installed to seal the breach in the back wall used to circumvent the electronic entrance gate			0
an evening patrol was hired to circle in our eight - block subdivision			0
the developer sent apologetic champagne , and the homeowners association sent repeated encouragements to " keep an eye out for anything unusual ! " heavily marketed as havens of prestige and a sure footing on the social ladder , gated communities in @entity28 also create an insidious fortress mentality			1
inside the enclaves that boast exclusivity and safety as their primary features , security means not just freedom from crime , but also protection from annoyances such as solicitors and strangers of any kind			0
you know , individuals that do not belong in our community			0
in other words , minorities and other less desirable social classes			0
this is the paradox of @entity28 's famed gated lifestyle , into which @entity82 walked , was shot and tragically died			1
and within such communities , a neighborhood watch member such as @entity84 can get carried away			1
while we do n't know what exactly happened in the encounter between @entity84 and @entity82 , questions about racial profiling , vigilantism and police prejudice were slow in coming partly because of @entity28 's penchant for enclave living			1
the forting - up phenomenon that began in the 1960s shows no sign of slowing , ranking @entity28 as second only to @entity99 in the number of walls , street patterns and barricades that separate people from each other			1
even though these features do not necessarily deliver on the promise of lower crime rate or more stable home value , they remain highly desirable			0
their popularity complicates the debate over whether @entity82 or @entity84 deserves the benefit of the doubt			1
" for residents who are n't expecting people to be passing through , to be in their space , attitudes can be taken to the extreme , " @entity116 , @entity118 's representative at the @entity119 , told me			2
fenced in against their own insecurity , residents living within the perimeter revere active vigilance			1
those who want to play border patrol and muscle outsiders around can easily do so unchecked			0
" when you discourage drive - through traffic and pedestrians , it becomes abnormal to see someone walking			0
and now you 've created a situation where two people alone are hazardous to each other because there 's no one else around , no cars driving by , no eyes on the street , " @entity137 added			0
today 's cameras , fences , walls and gates do little to create an atmosphere of openness , which is an essential element in a diverse society			1
when segregation of our living spaces becomes the wallpaper we no longer see , communities become brittle , unable to prevent and shut down the most dangerous behavior			1
our children deserve to grow up in a culture of responsibility that does n't stop at the neighborhood gates			2
as the design of our communities becomes more divided , the " as paranoid as possible " citizens living in fear of those lurking outside of their walls too often overlook the more distressing attitudes within			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity173 .			2

@entity173 : gated communities in @entity28 create an insidious fortress mentality
@entity178 : residents living within the perimeter of such places revere active vigilance
she says a neighborhood watch member like @entity84 can get carried away
@entity178 : to have a diverse society , we need less segregation of living spaces
