the @entity0 has a big problem on its hands : finding someone to replace defense secretary @entity4 , who was pushed out of the administration this week			1
since @entity7 withdrew her name from consideration on tuesday , there is a growing sense that many potential candidates may be shying away from the job due to the short time frame they would be in office and concerns over how independently they can function from the @entity16 , according to both current and former senior administration and congressional officials			1
@entity7 cited family reasons for her decision to withdraw her name , but several administration officials say the decision came as a surprise because she had known she was on the short list of candidates being vetted			0
another name now being widely circulated is former deputy defense secretary @entity27 € ” who is widely credited with reforming cumbersome and expensive weapons acquisition procedures and programs , but who had clashed in the past with @entity0 staff as well			1
the scramble to find a new defense secretary comes as new details emerge over @entity38 's departure from the administration			2
@entity38 submitted his letter of resignation on monday after it became apparent over a series of meetings with president @entity45 that the president no longer wanted him in the job			1
" @entity38 did n't wait to be asked to leave , " a senior administration official close to @entity38 tells @entity49			1
@entity45 and @entity38 had three conversations since late october , the last one being on nov. 18			1
" if you have three conversations with the president , you know where things stand " , the official said			0
after the final conversation , @entity38 has a personal sense of " inevitability " he would resign , rather than wait to be fired , the official said , describing to @entity49 in detail the secretary 's actions and thinking			2
the official said @entity38 rapidly came to the conclusion after that final meeting he " would not put up a fight , " to keep his job , but would instead resign " giving the president options " to chart a different course			1
@entity38 views his decision somewhat in military terms , when an officer submits his resignation knowing he will otherwise be fired			2
the official said @entity38 is " at peace " with his resignation and believes it was the honorable thing to do			2
" he knew he was n't wanted , " the official said			0
@entity38 has been criticized for being a secretary who implements @entity0 policy rather than being a dynamic member of a tight inner @entity45 circle offering new ideas and options			1
but this official strongly disputed portions of that characterization , saying " even @entity89 is n't a member of that circle , " referring to the secretary of state			0
while @entity38 may not have regularly spoken up in large meetings , he did seek to be involved the official says			1
in september , he wrote a memo for @entity45 and the @entity16 to " make the case " that the administration needed to look for more " creative and active ways to deter @entity99 , " the official said			2
behind the scenes , @entity38 had grown deeply frustrated by the decision making process at the @entity16 , which is universally described as " micromanagement			0
" @entity38 joins former defense secretaries @entity103 and @entity105 , who have also detailed @entity16 interference in both of their books and recent public appearances			0
@entity38 was also frustrated on several key issues where he had indeed offered specific views			0
he had wanted more immediate action on sending non lethal military aid to @entity116 , and also had written a memo calling for a clearer approach to @entity120 military and diplomatic action in @entity122			0
the @entity123 was aware both memos had been poorly received at the @entity16			0
the official insisted that @entity38 is fully supportive of the president 's policy of not putting troops on the ground in @entity130 in combat roles			0
if @entity45 pushed @entity38 out because he is looking for a course correction on the war against @entity135 in @entity130 and @entity122 , it has not gotten to the point where @entity38 or the chairman of the @entity138 , general @entity137 , have been asked for any new options			1
opinion : pushing out @entity38 not shake - up @entity45 needs it now appears likely a confirmation hearing for @entity38 's successor might not be scheduled before february , leaving a new @entity123 chief with less than two years on the job			1
several administration officials tell @entity49 the @entity0 is also well aware any confirmation hearing could be a bruising fight given that sen. @entity150 ( @entity151 ) is taking over the @entity152 and is a deep odds with the @entity0 over @entity122 and @entity130			0
that all adds up to a relatively short term in office likely that will almost certainly be characterized by fights with a @entity157 on everything from the war against @entity135 to potential mandatory spending cuts .			0

@entity4 resigned this week
@entity38 *stepped* down after meetings made clear @entity45 did n't want him on the job
@entity0 is having a hard time finding a successor
