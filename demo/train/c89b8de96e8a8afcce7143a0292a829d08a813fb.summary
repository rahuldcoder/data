-- a single phone call by @entity5 's trusted courier tipped off @entity7 officials to his @entity2 compound , ultimately leading to the raid that killed the @entity11 leader , a senior @entity2 intelligence official told @entity0 saturday			1
the telephone call the courier made was " not the final one -- it was the initial piece of evidence " that sparked the focus on the compound in @entity19 , the official said			1
four years ago , @entity7 officials uncovered the identity of a trusted @entity5 courier -- later identified as a @entity22 named @entity23 -- whom they believed was living with and protecting the @entity11 leader			1
the @entity26 , citing @entity7 intelligence officials , reported friday that @entity7 had intercepted a " catch - up phone call " @entity23 took from an old friend			1
" this is where you start the movie about the hunt for @entity5 , " one @entity7 official briefed on the intelligence - gathering leading up to the early monday raid on the compound told the @entity26			1
the @entity2 official told @entity0 the phone call was made by the courier , though he did n't know when			1
the courier and his brother were among those killed in monday 's raid			0
in recent days , the materials taken from @entity5 's compound continued to yield a trove of intelligence , including details about a possible attack on the 10th anniversary of 9/11			1
at a briefing saturday focusing on the intelligence aspects of the raid , @entity7 officials released five videos showing the @entity11 leader			1
they were seized at his compound			0
one video looks like a home movie , a portrait of a graying man watching television , but it is an image that suggests how conscious @entity5 was of his image			0
the other videos showed him in more formal attire , making remarks , but @entity7 officials removed the audio in all five videos			1
as early as february 2010 , @entity11 members discussed a plan to derail trains in the @entity7 by placing obstructions on tracks over bridges and valleys , the alert said , according to one law enforcement official			2
the plan was to be executed later this year , coinciding with the 10th anniversary of the september 11 attacks , though no specific rail system was identified , the official said			0
the @entity82 confirmed a notice was sent to federal , state , local and tribal authorities			0
" we have no information of any imminent terrorist threat to the @entity7 rail sector , but wanted to make sure our partners are aware of the alleged plotting			0
it is unclear if any further planning has been conducted since february of last year , " spokesman @entity92 said			0
rail agencies across the @entity7 heightened security			0
a @entity7 official said that " valuable information has been gleaned already " from the information gathered at @entity5 's compound , though no specific plots or terrorist suspects were identified			1

investigators want to know whether any of the people are @entity11 members or sympathizers			0
the @entity7 and @entity2 have been allies for years in the anti-terrorism effort , but @entity7 concerns that @entity2 have n't been robust enough in the fight against @entity142 militants and suspected @entity7 drone attacks that killed innocent civilians have heightened tensions			2
