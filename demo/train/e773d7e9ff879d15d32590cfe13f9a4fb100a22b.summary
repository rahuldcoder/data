instead they got life without parole			0
@entity10 was the first woman executed in @entity1 in nearly a century			1
the victims ' family members witnessed the execution , state @entity26 spokesman @entity25 said			1
news media witnesses said @entity10 appeared frightened when she entered the death chamber and approached the gurney			1

and i am very sorry			0
" the inmate was referring to her stepdaughter , witness @entity35 , daughter of murder victim @entity10 and sister of victim @entity37			1
" she has no recriminations , she has no ill will for anybody , " @entity10 attorney @entity38 said			2
" i think frankly that she had accepted what was going to happen tonight a long time ago , and she was very peaceful with that			0
" the death row inmate pleaded guilty in the 2002 slayings of her husband and stepson in their rural home near @entity49 , @entity1 , about 145 miles from @entity50			1
@entity10 , whom the state argued is evil , was the first woman executed in the @entity53 in five years			2

@entity66 also released a statement late thursday			0
" tonight , the machinery of death in @entity1 extinguished the beautiful , childlike and loving human spirit of @entity5 ... " @entity38 said			1
" @entity5 asked that i send her thanks and love to all of those who have supported her in this fight for her life			1
in her words , ' it 's just awesome			0
' it is our hope that @entity5 's death will cause a re-examination of the badly broken system of justice that could allow something as wrong and unjust as this to happen			1
" on tuesday , the @entity53 @entity88 denied a stay of execution appeal			0
@entity1 gov. @entity91 also rejected a clemency request			1
" having carefully reviewed the petition for clemency , the judicial opinions in this case , and other relevant materials , i find no compelling reason to set aside the sentence that was imposed by the @entity100 and affirmed by all reviewing courts , " @entity91 wrote			0
" accordingly , i decline to intervene and have notified the appropriate counsel and family of my decision			0
" @entity10 and her lawyers argued to the governor that she had an iq that was borderline mentally retarded and that she was manipulated into committing the crimes by a dominant male co-defendant			1
she pleaded guilty to her participation in the murders but later regretted her actions , they said			0
two anti-death penalty groups pleaded with @entity91 to show clemency			2
" @entity5 's death sentence , imposed despite clear evidence of her diminished mental capacities , disabilities and addictions , undermines any confidence that she was properly adjudicated to be ' worthy ' of death , " argued @entity117 for @entity118 and the @entity119			1
" the final failure of the death penalty system in @entity1 rests squarely on the desk of governor @entity91			1
he should do the right thing and allow @entity5 the same punishment , which was given to her co-defenders -- life imprisonment			2
" " i just want the governor to know that i am so sorry , deeply from my heart , " @entity10 recently said			1
" and if i could take it back , i would , in a minute			0
... i just wish i could take it back			0
and i 'm sorry for all the people that i 've hurt in the process			0
" @entity10 admitted to police that she concocted the plot to kill her husband , @entity10 , and his son @entity144 , an @entity145 reservist set to be deployed to @entity146			1
at the time , she was having an affair with @entity148 and paid him and then - 19 - year - old @entity149 to commit murder for the victims ' insurance money			0
court records show that @entity10 gave the two killers cash to buy weapons and left the door of the home open for easy entry			2
@entity10 was in bed with her husband when he was hit with a shotgun blast by @entity148			1
@entity10 survived long enough to tell police , " my wife knows who did this to me			2
" @entity149 killed @entity37 in his bedroom down the hall			0
despite her guilty plea , a state judge later sentenced @entity10 to death while sparing the lives of @entity148 and @entity149			1
at sentencing , the judge called her " the head of this serpent			0
" " i can frankly say that @entity5 is as evil a person as i 've ever met , " @entity178 , commonwealth 's attorney for @entity179 , who was at the scene shortly after the crimes occurred			1
" i would wager with some assurance that you would n't find anyone who knew her before this event occurred who thought she was mentally retarded or had a limited mentality -- that it would ever cross their minds			0
" her supporters said @entity10 was deeply remorseful and had been a model prisoner , helping fellow female inmates cope with their circumstances			2
" i do feel i could be a lot of help to some of the women , which i have already			0
from my understanding , i 've already helped a lot to change their lives or made them look at their lives in a different way , " @entity10 said			2
@entity207 and best - selling author @entity208 were among those supporting leniency			0
@entity178 said @entity10 had a " fairly low " iq but noted that courts have concluded she was not mentally retarded			2
the state also argued that @entity10 waited 45 minutes after the shootings before calling police and that she had involved her then - 16 - year - old daughter in the plot			2
@entity66 argued that such evidence suggested " @entity5 could not have been the mastermind			2
" " @entity148 has stated , and the experts that have examined her agree , that she was being used by @entity148 , not the other way around , " he said			0
@entity10 ' attorneys said that @entity148 admitted he used @entity37 to get at the $ 250,000 she would receive in the event her stepson died			1
a letter from @entity148 to another woman , they say , said that the only reason he slept with @entity37 was " so she would give me the insurance money			0
" " she was exactly what i was looking for , " he wrote			0
" some ugly bitch who married her husband for the money and i knew i could get to fall head over heels for me			0
" furthermore , they said , @entity148 said he " manipulated the whole thing " and " knew he was going ' take ' @entity10 from the moment he met her , " according to an affidavit from one of their investigators			1
but @entity148 , who committed suicide in 2006 , refused to sign the affidavit and actually tore up and ate part of it			0
still , @entity178 said , his investigation showed that @entity10 took an active role in the plot , that she connived and manipulated everyone from her late husband to her lover to her children			1
from early on , he said , @entity10 schemed several different ways to get the inheritance money			2
she helped plan an earlier plot to kill her husband that failed .			0
