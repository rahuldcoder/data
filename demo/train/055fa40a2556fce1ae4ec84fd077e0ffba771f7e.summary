-- should the world 's best video game players -- those who earn six figures and play professionally -- be considered athletes ? are they on par with @entity8 ? people who read @entity0 's recent story on pro gaming and gaming addiction in @entity13 raised these questions in comments threads , on @entity16 and over e-mail			1
many criticized @entity0 for highlighting the dark side of video gaming in that country , instead of celebrating the achievements of the world 's best e-sports athletes			1
specifically at issue was the story of @entity27 , one of the world 's best " @entity33 " players who , in the past , worried his parents and teachers because he practiced sometimes for 20 hours a day			1
they flagged him as a potential gaming " addict , " but his parents now support his quest to be the world 's best at the strategy game he loves			2
furthermore , they regret having pushed back against their son 's passion			0
how do you draw the line between obsessive , unhealthy behavior and a drive to be the world 's best ? should pro gamers ( or chess players , for that matter ) be put in the same class as track - and - field stars and gymnasts , who also go to extreme lengths to get in shape for competition ? many pro gamers in @entity13 , for example , are required to run , swim and lift weights as part of their training			1
here 's a look at what some of you had to say			0
comments may be edited for brevity and clarity : on the training schedules of pro gamers vs @entity8 : " would you claim that @entity73 is addicted to swimming ? simply because someone works hard at something that is not what you view as a traditional sport does not mean their work is not real , and difficult			1
i dare you to compare top e-sport athlete 's training regimens to top @entity85 athletes training regimens			1
i would n't be surprised in the least if their schedules were similar			0
" -- @entity88 , 22 , from @entity89 , @entity90 on @entity27 as an athlete : " to me , @entity92 ( @entity27 ) represents many things			1
he represents dedication and skill and perseverance			0
he is one of the best in the world at one of the most difficult endeavors that has ever existed and he is beloved by his fans for good @entity103 to mention him in the same breath as something bizarre like addiction is to belittle everything he has worked for and everything we as a community value			2
" -- twitter user @ kevinflo , over e-mail on passion / love vs. addiction : " they make money doing something they love , which takes hard work , perseverance and sacrifice			2
" -- @entity0 commenter " @entity127 " on when that passion goes too far : " we all know that most pro gamers started because they became addicted to gaming , not because they played every now and then			1
and it was their addiction and their willingness to spend most of their time in front of a computer that made them so good and eligible to become pros			2
also , it 's not because you make money doing something that makes it ok ( just look at gambling )			0
you can rationalize it as much as you want but an addiction is an addiction , period			2
it means that your life is not balanced and therefore it means you have a problem			0
are there other ( more conventional ) professions in the world like that ? of course there are			0
but two wrongs do n't make one right			0
" -- @entity0 commenter " diiggas " on the skill required to be a pro gamer : " this article did not truly distinguish the difference between game addiction and professional gaming or even gaming as a hobby			1
i do no ( t ) believe the article shows the amount of skill needed to be one of the best in the world or how truly big professional gaming has become			0
" -- @entity177 , 24 , from @entity178 , @entity179 on " physicality " being an important part of athletics : " i would n't call them athletes			0
the one common denominator with all @entity8 is the physicality involved			0
even the word athlete refers to physical activity			0
i have no issues with video gaming , but the @entity85 just seems to be the wrong venue			2
" -- @entity0 commenter " t0of1y " on video games as physical challenges : " their reflexes ( physical ) approach the zenith of human capability			1
" -- @entity0 commenter " @entity199 " we would love to continue this conversation , so please let us know what you think in the comments section of this post , or message @entity207 on @entity16 or @entity209 .			1
