-- @entity16 's " @entity15 " has been mired in controversy since it debuted in 2009 , and much of the distaste for the series stemmed from concerns about whether we were feeding the stage mothers ' desire for attention , or about the insensitivity in taping and televising children in the middle of a meltdown or temper tantrum			1
but whether you think child beauty pageants are just a chance for little girls to play dress - up , or a training ground for superficial , self - centered princesses in the making , everyone should agree that sexualizing a 3 - year - old little girl is wrong			1
in what was likely a misguided effort to gin up publicity and ratings for the show , @entity16 released footage of a 3 - year - old contestant dressed as the prostitute played by @entity36 in the 1990 film " @entity38			1
" this stupidity came just one week after @entity16 -- still known to many as @entity16 -- was forced to pull its @entity42 page because of the deluge of negative comments over an episode that featured a little girl dressed up to look like @entity47 , complete with padded bust and buttocks			1
instead of creating ratings - friendly buzz , @entity16 engendered outrage among millions of parents and grandparents , who are tired of seeing children exploited for ratings and robbed of their innocence by a greedy entertainment industry that will stop at nothing to make a buck			1
like @entity36 ' film character just before she hits the streets , the toddler is shown strutting back and forth on stage wearing thigh - high pvc boots , a blond bobbed wig , and a white tank top connected to a tight blue skirt at the midriff by a large silver hoop			2
common sense is all too often a casualty of the media culture we live in			0
parents assume the sexual content and innuendo in the programming they are watching will go over their child 's head , or think it 's cute to dress their child in sexy clothes or encourage her to imitate @entity87 's dance moves so they can post it on @entity89			0
in reality , they are teaching their children what kind of behavior will help them get noticed			0
for years we 've seen adult sexuality being inappropriately and aggressively foisted on innocent young children , but kids today are being sexualized at younger and younger ages			0
a decade ago , parents worried about their teen daughters coming home from the mall with hip - riders			0
now parents have to combat marketing forces that are telling their third - graders they need to have a padded push - up bikini top , or their second - graders that they need to have shoes that promote fitness , but are the same shoes sold to adults to tone and shape buttocks and thighs			2
where does it all stop ? what have we come to when toddlers , not yet able to read , let alone make decisions for themselves , are getting schooled in dressing and acting sexy for adults ? everyone in society suffers when children are sexualized , but those hurt worst are the children themselves			0
in february 2007 , the @entity127 released a report on the sexualization of girls that found that girls ' exposure to hypersexualized media content can negatively impacts their cognitive and emotional development ; is strongly associated with eating disorders , low self - esteem and depression ; leads to fewer girls pursuing careers in science , technology , engineering and mathematics ; and causes diminished sexual health			1
but it 's not just our daughters who are being affected by these images			2
boys and adult men are also learning to value women only for their sex appeal , which the report says can lead to increased incidents of sexual harassment and sexual violence , and increased demand for child pornography			0
@entity16 's official " no comment " response to a question from @entity0 about the outrage is ridiculous			1
executives are not only complicit in the act of sexualizing toddlers , they are unwilling to own up to their role in encouraging this kind of behavior			0
the product that @entity16 , a mainstream cable television network , is selling is sexed - up toddlers			1
they should be ashamed , and parents across the country should renew their commitment to teach their children that they are valued for who they are , not for how sexy they look			0
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity179 .			2

@entity179 : @entity16 's " @entity15 " promotes sexualization of toddlers , girls
a 3 - year - old wore a padded *bra* and buttocks , another dressed as a prostitute
@entity179 says girls ' exposure to hypersexualized media is *harmful* in many ways
she says @entity16 should be ashamed for promoting images of sexed - up toddlers for ratings
