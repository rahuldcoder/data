-- he has sculpted a new career , much to the relief of his body			2
where once it was concussions and broken bones @entity5 had to contend with , now the former @entity11 jockey works with clay molds and bronze casts			1
to the casual racegoer , the 64 - year - old sculptor 's work will already be well known -- his trademark life - size models of celebrated racehorses are dotted around racecourses , stables and the homes of wealthy horse owners across @entity23 and the @entity24 " @entity29 was my first love , " he says of a 13 - year - old riding career , which included 340 winners and in which he came close to winning the prestigious @entity28			1
now he is consumed by a love of art. his latest exhibition is a series of bronze friezes , which also feature a number of horses , though with a more somber theme in bearing witness to @entity41 's 100th anniversary			1
entitled " farewell , @entity42 " the friezes capture the horrors of that conflict in graphic detail			2
before discovering a gift for sculpture , @entity5 initially struggled to adjust to life out of the saddle , missing the adrenalin fix the sport had given him			1
" you name it , i tried it -- all sorts of dangerous things , " recalls @entity5 , " jumping out of an airplane , riding motorcycles very fast , that sort of thing			1
" it was about five years of trying to seek a substitute but it wore off			0
" so the former art student , who realized an aptitude for sculpting during the latter part of his jockey career , began to pursue the discipline more seriously after finally hanging up his silks			1
" the sculpture is exciting in a similar way -- it 's like itching for a ride , the way you want to get into a studio if a piece of work is going well , " he explains			0
" when you 're into a work it 's mesmerizing			0
it 's your total focus -- that 's the same for a four - minute horse race to sculpture being a slow - motion version			2
" @entity5 's first big work was a life - sized version of three - time national winner @entity89 in 1988 which still takes pride of place at @entity93			1
he has also sculpted @entity94 , the famous gray steeplechaser , for @entity96 , as well as former @entity99 winner @entity97 for @entity100 in @entity101			0
@entity89 was a horse which in some ways defines @entity5 's two lives			1
in 1973 , @entity5 finished fourth on @entity105 as @entity89 won the @entity28 for the first time , while four years later he rode @entity107 to seventh in 1977 as the heralded bay gelding sealed a third victory over the @entity93 fences			1
@entity89 became something of a sporting celebrity in the @entity11 psyche , not falling in 100 races , and his third win is regarded as one of the greatest moments in @entity11 sporting history			0
an event often referred to as the " the ultimate test of a horse 's courage " and the richest jump race in @entity124 with a prize fund of Â £ 1 million ( $ 1.6 million ) -- the @entity28 is tinged with frustration for @entity5			1
he believes he could and should have won the race in 1982 on board favorite @entity128			0
but the day before , against the advice of his trainer , he went to ride at @entity132 , only to fall at the last fence of the final race of the day			0
it ended with him being taken to hospital with a broken shoulder and , in his absence the next day , @entity128 fell at @entity138			0
" that horse needed a rider that knew him and on that day he did n't , so i really saw that as my one big chance to win the race , " says @entity5 , who placed in the top four on three occasions at @entity93			1
" but stupidly i threw it away			0
it 's one of the biggest regrets of my life			2
" @entity150 is a race he loved , one he rode well and one where he embraced the potential perils , falling to the turf for four of his nine rides in the race			2
" i had too much fun , " says @entity5 as he looks back on his career			1
" when i look at a jockey like @entity161 -- notorious for his relentless pursuit for riding perfection -- perhaps i was n't as dedicated as i might have been			2
there were missed opportunities , i could have done better			0
" instead with @entity89 and his other equine creations , @entity5 has become the @entity161 of equine sculpture , successfully allowing his initial passion to still live on through his art work			1
each one is created initially from a 1/16th - size model made of wire with clay molded around it before ironing out any issues			1
that then becomes a life - size model , with about three - quarters of a ton of clay used before the foundry comes in to take molds and the cast before the final creation is set in bronze			1
@entity5 's latest show is perhaps a nod to his father , @entity185 , a former general in the @entity186 , who also passed on his equine passion as a show jumper and steeplechaser to his son			1
his son , however , was unaware of his father 's military exploits until reading his 1993 autobiography			1
@entity194 was the recipient of the @entity195 , one of only 50,000 ever awarded , in his case for his role in the three - day @entity199 against @entity201 forces in @entity202 in 1944			2
he was later general officer commanding - in - chief in @entity204 just before the start of " @entity206 " -- bloody conflict between @entity209 republicans and the @entity11 government that began in the late 1960s until the @entity211 in 1998			0
in 1974 , @entity5 's father 's home was badly damaged by an @entity215 bomb			1
" i read about that but honestly i ca n't remember anything about it at the time , " admits his son			0
" it 's bad but i was so busy trying to ride winners that i do n't think i paid too much interest			0
" he kept that sort of thing quiet			0
of course , i realized he might be a target as a high - ranking officer but , really , that incident passed me by			0
" @entity5 's military friezes are made in bronze with a patina ( or thin layer of chemical on top ) which is blow - torched , thereby causing a reaction that changes the color of the metal , producing haunting images			1
further inspiration was derived by an earlier commission from former jockey and now journalist @entity242 to depict warrior , a famous military horse			0
@entity242 had once tried to persuade @entity5 to give up riding after yet another crash , and move into art full - time			1
" he did n't listen , carried on and finished third in the 1981 @entity28 , " recalls @entity242			1
" in fact , that year the top three jockeys i 'd advised all of them to pack it in			0
what do i know , hey ? " @entity242 argues his good friend was perhaps initially overshadowed by sir @entity185 , who was knighted in 1969			0
" it was difficult as his father was this amazing overachiever -- he had a picture in the @entity258 , an article in the @entity260 and rode a winner at @entity262 all in the same week , " @entity242 says			2
" so initially i think @entity5 went the other way , a bit of an underachiever			2
but actually he 's rather extraordinary -- he became a thoroughly good jockey and then the sculpting			0
he kept that to himself initially and his latest exhibition is wonderful , really quite daring			1
" i remember his son getting into music so he decided to take up the saxophone and taught himself			0
now he 's very accomplished			0
" @entity5 's artistic pathway has not been without its troubles -- his studio has twice suffered from nearby fires			2
in the first , his work was untouched , but in the second molds which had taken weeks to create make were ruined			0
recently relocated to @entity281 in the southwest of @entity23 , such fires are hopefully a thing of the past but when most are ready for retirement , @entity5 , having gone from @entity28 to grand designs , has no plans to call it quits			1
" i 'm a workaholic so i ca n't , " he says , driven by making his next piece of art better than the last			0
casting his mind three decades back , retirement from riding was something a relief , the pressure of having to make racing weight of 64 kilograms no longer a requirement , nor having to contend with a litany of injuries : four broken wrists , a fractured femur and all manner of concussions			2
@entity138 -- that famous @entity28 fence -- is no longer the driving force , more @entity308			2
" @entity312 , @entity42 " is on show at @entity311 's @entity310 from november 6 - 15 .			0

@entity5 rode horses for over a decade , now he sculpts them in life - size models
he came close to winning the @entity28 in his 13 - year riding career
now 64 , his latest exhibition of friezes remembers events of @entity41
it is part - inspired by his military father , whose home was once blown up by the @entity215
