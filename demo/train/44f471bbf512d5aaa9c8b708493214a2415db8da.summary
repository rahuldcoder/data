this year 's @entity1 was awarded to an @entity3 scientist who " fought a fierce battle against established science " and " fundamentally altered how chemists conceive of solid matter , " the @entity0 announced wednesday			1
@entity11 " tore apart what we thought we knew about crystals , " a scientist at the @entity13 said			1
@entity11 discovered that crystals do not have to have a regular repeating pattern , @entity15 said , comparing the revelation to the fall of the @entity18			1
" there are a few things that you know in life , like ' the @entity18 is not going to fall			1
' that was one of things that i knew growing up in @entity25 , " @entity15 said			1
@entity11 's discovery in 1982 was as disruptive to chemistry as the fall of the wall was to world politics , @entity15 said			1
the very definition of a crystal was that it was " periodic , " or that its molecules were packed together in a regular , repeating way			0
" @entity11 comes along and proves us all wrong , " said @entity15			1
" it 's the next step in crystallography			0
before dr. @entity11 's discovery , this was thought impossible			1
it absolutely deserves the @entity1			1
" @entity11 is a professor at the @entity44			2
his discovery is called quasicrystals			0
unlike other crystals , quasicrystals do not have a repeating pattern at the molecular level			0
they are very hard , but break easily , like glass			0
interestingly , the structure of quasicrystals seems to have been foreshadowed in medieval @entity56 art that contradicts what @entity58 geometry had always taught			2
" if you want to tile a bathroom floor with squares , you can do it out to infinity , " said @entity60 , a post-doctorate researcher at @entity61 who has studied @entity56 tile work			1
" if you want to do it with five - sides figures , there are gaps , " he explained			0
but @entity56 artists figured out how to do it without leaving gaps by making the pattern irregular rather than repeating -- the same thing that happens in quasicrystals , he said			2
" @entity81 mosaics , such as those found in the medieval @entity56 mosaics of the @entity84 in @entity85 and the @entity86 in @entity87 , have helped scientists understand what quasicrystals look like at the atomic level , " the @entity79 academy said			2
@entity56 tile patterns dating back to the early 1400s were put together in ways not understood in the @entity97 until 1973 , @entity60 and @entity92 of @entity93 argued in a paper in 2007 in the journal @entity100			1
the @entity56 artists discovered ways to tile shapes with five , 10 or 12 shapes without leaving gaps between them -- a structure thought by standard geometry to be impossible			1
@entity109 mathematician and physicist @entity108 explained in 1973 how it was done , and just over a decade later the same pattern was found at the molecular level in quasicrystals , according to a report in @entity116 and @entity92 's work in the journal nature in 2007			0
@entity60 said he was " thrilled to pieces " that @entity11 had won the prize			2
" the discovery was incredibly monumental , and he 's just the nicest guy , " @entity60 said			2
@entity15 , a principle research scientist at @entity13 , said he was " fascinated " by the structure of quasicrystals , even as he admitted he would not have the knowledge to analyze them himself			1
but specialists in quasicrystals will eventually " gain knowledge of some structures which we can not analyze with conventional methods , " he predicted			0
the academy that awards the @entity1 said quasicrystals have a " unique atomic structure " which makes them " bad conductors of heat and electricity , and ( they ) have nonstick surfaces			2
" " their poor thermal transport properties may make them useful as so - called thermoelectric materials , which convert heat into electricity , " the academy said			0
the prize in chemistry is worth 10 million @entity79 kronor ( about $ 1.44 million )			1
on tuesday , the @entity0 named @entity149 from @entity150 and the @entity151 ; @entity152 of @entity153 and @entity154 of @entity155 and the @entity156 , the winners of the 2011 @entity158			0
they made the discovery that our universe apparently is expanding at an accelerating rate some 14 billion years after the @entity163			0
the @entity1 committee on monday named @entity165 , a biologist with @entity167 , and scientists @entity168 and @entity170 , the winners of the 2011 @entity172			0
the announcement came three days after @entity165 died of pancreatic cancer at age 68			0
this week , the committee also will announce prizes in literature and peace			0
the prize in economics will be announced monday .			0

@entity11 's discovery was like the fall of the @entity18 , a scientist says
@entity11 " tore apart what we thought we knew , " @entity15 of @entity13 says
@entity56 tile patterns hundreds of years old help explain the discovery
the @entity1 is worth about $ 1.44 million
