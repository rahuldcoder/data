@entity0 -- @entity3 prime minister @entity2 defended his government 's decision wednesday to speed up construction in @entity0			1
" we will continue to build in @entity0			0
this is our right and obligation , " @entity2 said at a @entity9 memorial ceremony for former tourism minister @entity10 , who was assassinated by @entity12 militants a decade ago			1
" this is not a punishment -- it is our national right to build our capital			2
i guarantee that we will never return to the situation we had on the evening of the @entity22 , " @entity2 said			0
his remarks came a day after his government announced it was expediting construction of 2,000 housing units in @entity0 and the occupied @entity27 and suspending the transfer of @entity12 tax revenue in wake of the @entity32 's successful membership bid at @entity33 , the @entity35 cultural , science , and education agency			1
@entity39 foreign minister @entity38 released a statement wednesday condemning the @entity3 measures and calling them " a serious blow to the ( @entity45 ) quartet 's efforts to restart peace negotiations			1
" " this settlement building program is illegal under international law and is the latest in a series of provocative and unhelpful settlement announcements , " he said in the statement			0
in @entity53 , @entity52 press secretary @entity51 said president @entity55 's administration was " deeply disappointed " with @entity3 's announcement			1
" unilateral actions work against efforts for direct negotiations " necessary to achieve a two - state solution to the @entity3 - @entity12 conflict , @entity51 told reporters wednesday			1
on tuesday , a senior @entity3 official said the planned construction involves 1,650 units in @entity0 and the rest in the @entity27 settlements of @entity68 and @entity69			0
the construction will take place in areas that are expected to be part of @entity3 territory in any future peace agreement , the official said , and there is no contradiction between it and the various peace plans that have been on the table			2
@entity12 claim the land @entity3 occupied in @entity0 and the @entity27 after the 1967 war as part of a future @entity12 state			1
@entity32 president @entity86 has said repeatedly that the @entity12 will not return to negotiations until @entity3 halts all settlement construction and accepts the borders in place before the @entity22			1
@entity3 , for its part , has maintained that negotiations should begin with no preconditions			0
" you can not expect @entity3 to continue to be restrained when the @entity32 leadership repeatedly slams the door in our face , " said the @entity3 official , who was not authorized to speak to the media			0
as an example of a door slamming , the official cited the @entity33 bid and the effort to win membership in the @entity35 among other instances of @entity12 actions that damaged prospects for a peace deal			1
the @entity3 government has also put a temporary hold on the transfer of @entity12 tax revenue collected by the @entity3 government , the official said			2
@entity12 rely on the revenue to fund government operations , including the payment of public sector salaries			0
@entity38 , in his statement , expressed concern about that as well , saying it would have " direct implications for the @entity32 's ability to maintain effective security in the @entity27			0
" @entity129 , @entity86 ' spokesman , criticized the @entity3 construction announcement tuesday , calling the decision one " to accelerate the destruction of the peace process , " according to @entity134 , the @entity32 's official news agency			1
senior @entity12 negotiator @entity135 also condemned the move			2
" two days ago , they ( the @entity3 government ) announced the building of 1 million settlement housing units over the span of 10 years			0
what @entity3 decided today was another episode in settlement construction			0
using the @entity33 @entity12 membership is only looking for excuses and another way of building settlement housing units			1
this fits within the overall plan which was announced two days ago before the @entity33 vote , " he told @entity1			0
separately on tuesday , the permanent observer of the @entity32 to the @entity35 , @entity152 , said he sent a letter to the @entity35 secretary - general and the president of the @entity156 about @entity3			0
" we write today to express our grave concern about the military escalation undertaken by @entity3 , the occupying power , against the @entity161 , " he wrote			0
within the past four days , @entity3 airstrikes have killed at least 11 people and injured many more , @entity152 said			0
since saturday , scores of rockets have been fired into @entity3 from @entity161 , resulting in the death of one @entity3 civilian and the temporary closure of schools and universities in the southern part of the country			0
the @entity173 said monday that it would cut funding to @entity33 after the agency voted in support of @entity12 membership			1
the vote , which required two - thirds approval by @entity33 members , passed with 107 in favor , 14 against , and 52 abstentions			2
it was the first such vote by a part of the world body and is separate from the @entity12 bid for full membership in the @entity35			1
after monday 's vote , @entity12 officials told @entity1 they are considering the pursuit of membership in other international groups , such as the @entity194			2
" instead of sitting around the negotiating table , " @entity2 said after the vote , @entity12 leaders " have decided to make an alliance with @entity197 and are carrying out one - sided endeavors in the @entity35 , including today			2
we will not sit with folded arms against these measures which are hurting @entity3 and are violating bluntly the most basic obligations the parties took in the peace process , to solve the conflict between us through negotiations			1

@entity2 : " it is our national right to build our capital "
