@entity0 , @entity1 -- an army officer testifying at a military hearing wednesday that he first thought the rapid rate of gunfire suggested there was more than one shooter in last november 's @entity0 massacre			2
maj. @entity10 of the @entity11 told in chilling detail that he felt the shooter stalking him and could see the red laser from the gunsight flickering in his eyes			1
he said the gunman then turned away from him , distracted by gunfire from the civilian police officers who had rushed to the scene			2
@entity24 , testifying via video link from @entity23 , said all the shooting ceased when maj. @entity26 was brought down by police fire			1
@entity26 is charged with killing 13 people and wounding dozens of others in the rampage			1
@entity24 said he called out when he saw the gunman 's uniform and identification badge			2
" i remember saying to the police officer , ' he is one of us , ' " @entity24 said			2
still convinced there were other shooters , @entity24 said that after @entity26 was felled by the police fire , he grabbed @entity26 's handgun off the ground and prepared to fire it himself at any additional attackers			1
the gun was jammed , he said , and he burned his fingers on the barrel as he tried to clear it			2
the barrel was hot from firing what apparently was scores of rounds			2
in earlier testimony , @entity53 special agent @entity52 said 146 spent shell casings had been collected			2
sources close the prosecution later clarified that he was referring only to those found inside the building where the shooting began			2
another 68 were collected outside , for a total of 214 , they said			2
and @entity11 investigators said wednesday that the gunman still had 177 rounds on him when he was shot by police			2
the two police officers also testified wednesday			0
one of them , maj. @entity69 , testified that he found extra magazines and a second handgun , a revolver , after @entity26 was shot four times			1
@entity69 and his fellow civilian police officer , sgt. @entity75 , described the gunfight outside the building where the final stand - off occurred			1
" i challenged him , ' halt , military police , drop your weapon , ' " @entity69 said			0
" he raised his weapon and fired			1
" @entity85 , who was widely praised for her role in ending the shooting , admitted that she did not know how many times she had hit the gunman			0
" i did not see him fall from my shots			1
no , " @entity85 said			0
during her testimony , prosecutors showed a video automatically recorded by a camera mounted on the dashboard in her police car as she raced toward the shooting			0
in addition to the sound of sirens wailing and fast driving on the way to the scene , the video shows @entity85 dashing out of her vehicle and bystanders pointing to where the shooter was			0
@entity85 is then seen racing off camera			0
moments later the tape provides clear audio of repeated gunfire			0
a separate police car " dash - cam " was introduced during @entity69 's testimony , but because of a technical glitch there was no audio			1
neither police camera recorded the video of the final confrontation			1
@entity85 said she exchanged fire with the gunman and was injured herself			0
she told of the difficulty of getting off an accurate shot at the start of the confrontation because of people in the background			0
in the final moments , " i realized he was closing in , " @entity85 said			1
" we began to exchange fire again			0
he was shooting and i was returning fire			0
" after she was wounded three times , @entity85 was on the ground and her police weapon " malfunctioned , " she testified			0
the gunman walked up and kicked her weapon away			0
he did not shoot her again and @entity85 said he appeared to be having problems with his own weapon			0
she described the man , whom she identified as @entity26 , as solemn , with no expression , a description other witnesses have described in the previous days			1
listening to her testimony wednesday , @entity26 gave no reaction , occasionally looking down			1
he wore his usual fleece watch - cap pulled low on his brow and had a blanket bunched up around his shoulders			1
@entity85 said she remains on medical leave but expects to return to work on november 1			0
the defense spent longer in cross-examining @entity85 than any of the other more than 50 witnesses heard so far in this @entity155 , pointing up small differences between her testimony and what she told investigators immediately after the shootings			0
during the period of the final shots , @entity69 made repeated calls for @entity26 to drop his gun			1
he said the gunshots seemed to echo between the buildings			0
" it sounded like thousands of shots being fired , " he said			1
asked whether he knew if he hit @entity26 , @entity69 replied , " i see [ sic ] him wince a couple of times			1
" in the end , @entity26 fell to the ground , and @entity69 ran up , kicked his gun away , turned him over on his stomach and searched him			1
that 's when he found the additional gun , extra ammunition magazines and a cell phone			1
new testimony shows that the deadly massacre could have been much worse if @entity85 and @entity69 had not arrived when they did			0
@entity53 officer @entity182 said 177 unexpended rounds were recovered from @entity26 in both 30 - and 20 - round magazines			1
he also explained that he had two gun sights to help him shoot accurately : a red laser gunsight for low - light conditions and a second green laser , which is most effective in sunlight			1
@entity182 showed receipts found in @entity26 's car for gunsight batteries , providing a glimpse into the planning for the attack			1
at the end of the morning session , the defense entered objections to the introduction of autopsy reports for the 13 fatalities , saying they had been denied funding for an independent pathologist			1
the investigating officer , col. @entity205 , who acts as the presiding judge in the case , said he would receive the autopsy reports only to identify the victims and their cause of death			0
nine people died after being shot in the @entity11 medical processing center and four more died after they were rushed to the base hospital			0
the prosecution said it planned to complete presenting its case on thursday			0
the defense has been told it can take up its case november 8			0
a pause of at least one week in the proceedings had been planned to allow @entity0 to mark one year since the shooting and to honor the victims and those soldiers and civilians who exhibited special heroism			0
an article 32 hearing determines if there is enough evidence to proceed to a court - martial .			2

a witness says he saw the red laser from the gunsight flickering in his eyes
another says it " sounded like thousands of shots being fired " in the final standoff
a *cid* investigator says @entity26 still had " 30 - and 20 - round magazines " at the end
