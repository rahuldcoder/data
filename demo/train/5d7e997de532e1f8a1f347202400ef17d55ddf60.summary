@entity0 has long prided itself on its commitment to fairness			2
it is a signatory to a range of international conventions intended to protect the vulnerable and has in the past provided sanctuary for those seeking refuge , most notably in the wake of the @entity12			0
in recent years , however , successive @entity0 governments have adopted increasingly punitive measures to deter asylum seekers from coming to @entity0 by boat			1
this is despite @entity0 hosting relatively low numbers of refugees			0
now the @entity0 government has adopted a military response to the arrival of boats : its @entity24 is led by a three - star general and implemented by @entity0 @entity27 and @entity28 personnel			2
boats attempting to bring asylum seekers to @entity0 territory are intercepted and either towed or escorted back to @entity33 waters			1
if an intercepted boat is unseaworthy , @entity0 may transfer asylum seekers to lifeboats , with limited provisions , and release them close to @entity33 waters			1
they then have no choice but to return to @entity33			0
in implementing this extraordinary policy , @entity0 has entered @entity33 waters on a number of occasions , sparking protest from @entity33 over incursions into its sovereign territory			0
perhaps the most disturbing aspect of @entity0 's policy is its failure to identify and protect refugees among the asylum seekers it intercepts at sea , despite its obligation under the @entity53 to protect refugees from being returned to persecution			1
as @entity33 is not a party to the @entity53 , @entity0 has no assurance that refugees returned to @entity33 will not be deported to their home countries where they face harm			0
offshore processing a further troubling aspect of the policy is the refusal to process the claims of those arriving by boat in @entity0			1
asylum seekers are transferred to the @entity70 island nations of @entity71 and @entity73 's @entity72 for detention and processing within 48 hours of arriving in @entity0 territory			1
the detention centers on @entity71 and @entity72 are grossly overcrowded , lack adequate health services , are prone to outbreaks of disease and have inadequate water and sanitation			2
asylum seekers have engaged in self - harm and attempted suicide			2
the centers have been criticized by @entity87 and the @entity88 for not meeting required protection standards			0
in fact , the @entity0 minister for immigration and @entity91 has conceded that @entity0 is unable to guarantee the safety of every asylum seeker in the @entity73 detention facility			2
the stark reality is that a young @entity98 asylum seeker , @entity97 , was murdered on @entity72 in february 2014			0
asylum seekers have reported living in constant fear in detention and staying awake in shifts to watch over each other ; and many asylum seekers have suffered serious injuries there			1
the situation in the @entity71 detention center is equally grave			0
asylum seekers burnt down a significant portion of the detention facility in july 2013 , there have been allegations of sexual assault and the @entity88 has highlighted the gross inadequacies of the detention centre , particularly for children			1
who 's responsible ? disingenuously , @entity0 has attempted to argue that it only plays a support role in the facilities and has no responsibility for asylum seekers in these detention centers because @entity71 and @entity73 are sovereign nations			1
however , @entity0 has clear power and effective control in the facilities			0
it is responsible for selecting and transferring asylum seekers to the centers and for their day - to - day operation			2
@entity0 is also solely responsible for the high financial costs of running these detention centers			1
it pays for the operation and service provision at the centers , pays a visa fee in @entity71 for every asylum seeker detained or resettled there and is paying the legal costs @entity73 is incurring to fight the constitutional challenge to the @entity72 detention center			0
@entity0 's clear power and effective control in the centers means that it has certain responsibilities under international law to the detained asylum seekers			1
by failing to determine the suitability of detention for each individual detainee and exposing asylum seekers to unacceptable conditions , @entity0 is arbitrarily detaining asylum seekers and subjecting them to " cruel , inhuman and degrading treatment and punishment , " according to @entity87			1
such treatment violates its obligations under the @entity158			0
further , the current indefinite detention of children in @entity71 places @entity0 in violation of its obligations under the @entity163 and @entity24 targets asylum seekers who come to @entity0 by boat , in violation of @entity0 's obligation under the @entity53 to refrain from punishing refugees for their mode of arrival in a country			1
resettlement plans @entity0 has vowed not to resettle any of the refugees it sends to @entity71 and @entity73			0
@entity71 has agreed to issue five - year visas to refugees processed in @entity71 and @entity73 has also indicated a willingness to resettle refugees processed in that country			0
in addition , @entity0 has reached in - principle agreement with @entity181 to resettle some of the refugees processed in @entity71			0
relying on impoverished nations , which may not be in a position to protect the rights or safety of refugees , is deeply concerning			0
the @entity0 government 's unwillingness to resettle refugees in @entity0 is another reminder of the deliberate harshness of its asylum policies			2
these extreme measures are intended to make asylum in @entity0 an unattractive option for the vulnerable people who may wish to seek protection			2
they repudiate the country 's reputation for fairness and commitment to human rights .			1
