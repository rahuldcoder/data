-- @entity2 president @entity1 has now paved the way for imposing economic sanctions against @entity5			1
however , these would be an ineffective and naive response by the @entity2 to the crisis in @entity9			0
economic sanctions have little independent usefulness for the pursuit of non-economic goals			1
this is not to say that sanctions never work , but rather that 95 % of cases are unsuccessful			1
in many cases , sanctions will make the political situation worse			1
@entity18 often makes states and societies willing to endure considerable punishment rather than abandon their national interests			0
modern states , simply put , are not that fragile -- sanctions can hurt a regime , but they can not break it			1
in this way , imposing economic sanctions on a state is similar to backing an angry dog into a corner -- in most cases , the dog will become more vicious , and more defensive			1
history might seem to indicate otherwise			0
economic sanctions often go hand - in - hand with military intervention , which can sprout misleading conclusions			1
this is true of the sanctions we imposed on @entity41 in 1990 , when @entity42 invaded @entity43 : @entity2 military intervention in 1991 was still necessary to force his retreat			0
few would say that economic sanctions were successful in kicking him out			1
indeed , sanctions continued after the @entity50 with little to no effect , until we finally removed the regime by force in 2003			2
further , sanctions typically take the form of a great power or coalition seeking to leverage a relatively weak state			0
the suggestion that they might be effective against a major global power like @entity5 is seriously flawed			2
even those who do believe sanctions might work on @entity63 would likely find the idea of imposing sanctions on @entity5 to be preposterous			1
there are two reasons why			0
first , even if economic sanctions were an effective form of leverage , @entity5 can squeeze us almost effectively as we can squeeze them			1
@entity72 , a @entity73 economist , simply threatened to not repay debt to @entity2 bankers in response to @entity2 - imposed sanctions			0
between great powers , leverage is a two - way street			0
second , @entity81 is clearly prepared to incur economic costs to accomplish his objectives in @entity9			0
even without sanctions , the deployment of troops to @entity86 has already affected the @entity5 economy			1
on march 3 the @entity90 stock market fell more than 10 % which , as a @entity92 article pointed out , wiped nearly $ 60 billion off the value of @entity5 companies -- more than the $ 51 billion spent on the @entity95 in @entity96			2
meanwhile , @entity81 's approval ratings remained high			0
by threatening sanctions , @entity1 is not giving @entity5 president @entity81 enough credit			1
of course the @entity5 leader has considered this scenario , and it did not deter him from occupying @entity86			2
furthermore , if we impose sanctions and @entity5 breaks commitments with @entity2 bankers in response , what would be the effect ? from a strategic standpoint , none			2
we certainly would n't let @entity5 use economic threats to dictate our foreign policy , no matter what the economic cost ; why should we expect the @entity5 leadership to budge ? but if sanctions are a bad idea , what is the alternative ? the key to keeping @entity9 unified is to take away support for @entity5 annexation			1
this means solidifying support for the new government in @entity125 among the @entity5 population in the @entity127 , especially in @entity86			2
@entity1 must encourage the new government in @entity9 to strengthen economic and political ties with the @entity131 population			2
this means bringing in election monitors to encourage faith and participation in the new regime , and creating new economic programs to bolster well - being in the eastern part of the country			0
the @entity2 should offer support to fund those efforts			0
the @entity142 must remember that in 2011 , 70 % of @entity143 considered @entity9 their " motherland , " despite most of them being @entity5 - speaking			0
in other words , until the proposed @entity147 deal went sour , there was little sentiment in @entity86 for secession or annexation			0
a return to these conditions in @entity9 , and not economic sanctions against @entity5 , is the key to stopping @entity81			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity158 .			0

@entity158 argues economic sanctions against @entity5 would not work
he argues that while sanctions can hurt a regime , they can not break it
in many cases , sanctions will make the political situation worse , he says
