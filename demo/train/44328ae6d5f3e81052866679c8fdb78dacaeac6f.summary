more than one month after a police officer fatally shot 18 - year - old @entity1 in @entity2 , @entity3 , the case continues to provoke public unrest and remains far from settled			1
the white police officer 's shooting of the unarmed black teenager in the @entity10 suburb is being robustly debated and investigated			2
where does the criminal investigation stand ? so far , there have been no charges filed , but the investigation is ongoing			2
a @entity10 grand jury is investigating and hearing testimony into @entity1 's killing and whether @entity19 police officer @entity19 should be charged or not			1
the grand jury will look at two issues : was a crime committed and is there " probable cause " that the accused person -- namely @entity19 -- committed that crime			1
the grand jury , which meets in secrecy , consists of nine white people ( six men and three women ) and three black people ( two women and a man ) , court officials said			1
grand jurors began meeting last month , and their progress on reaching a decision is n't public information , though it 's expected to take two months			2
@entity10 prosecuting attorney @entity38 is the prosecutor presenting evidence to the grand jurors			2
what is the @entity41 doing ? federal officials are conducting two civil rights investigations , one into @entity1 's killing and the other into @entity48 's overall track record with minorities			1
one investigation is looking into the august 9 shooting by @entity19 , a 28 - year - old officer with six years of experience , including four in @entity19			2
a civil rights violation would require that @entity19 had shown " racial hostility " against @entity1 in the shooting , legal analysts say			1
the @entity41 also announced a second inquiry this month to examine accusations that the police department as a whole practiced racial profiling and heavy - handed tactics			2
" people consistently expressed concerns stemming from specific alleged incidents , from general policing practices and from the lack of diversity on the @entity19 police force			0
these anecdotal accounts underscore the history of mistrust of law enforcement in @entity19 that has received a good deal of attention , " @entity71 attorney general @entity70 said earlier this month			0
" our investigation will assess the police department 's use of force , including deadly force			0
it will analyze stops , searches and arrests			0
and it will examine the treatment of individuals detained at @entity19 's city jail , " @entity70 said			0
the second investigation typically looks at possible reforms for a law enforcement agency , rather than punishing past alleged misconduct , analysts say			0
how long will the two federal probes take ? they will likely require lots of time , if similar past cases are any indication			0
for example , the @entity41 took five years in its investigation of whether @entity107 police officer @entity106 , who is white , violated the civil rights of @entity109 , 19 , who was black and fatally shot by @entity106 , the @entity103 reported			1
as in the @entity1 case , the killing of @entity109 ignited riots in @entity107 in 2001 , but the @entity41 announced in 2006 that @entity106 did n't violate @entity109 ' civil rights , the newspaper reported			1
when investigating an entire police department , the @entity41 investigation can easily take a year or more , according to a 2013 report by the @entity120 that 's entitled , " @entity115 of local police : lessons learned			1
" for example , in 1994 , the @entity41 investigators took a year to investigate the @entity125 , @entity126 , @entity127 for civil right abuses , the research forum said			1
by 1997 , @entity125 entered into a consent decree in which the city would identify problematic police behavior and collect data on officers ' conduct			0
in 1999 , the @entity137 police officers in the @entity138 were accused of misconduct and later convicted of " an array of crimes that included unprovoked shootings and beatings , " the research forum said			0
by 2001 , @entity137 police entered into a consent decree to make reforms over five years , but a federal judge became displeased with the progress of reforms and he extended the decree five more years , amounting to a total of 12 years of federal oversight , the forum said			0
in all , more than 25 police department have experienced some form of @entity41 intervention the past two decades , and " some later investigations and reform processes have taken 10 years or more , " the police forum said			1
what is @entity19 doing to address community anger ? in the aftermath of street riots following the shooting , the @entity161 has tried to soothe public outrage , but at a council meeting this month , the first since the @entity1 shooting , the gallery turned raucous			1
residents chanted @entity1 's name and shouted at council members , according to media reports			2
nonetheless , the council gave the first reading of a proposed ordinance to create a citizen review board to work with the police department			1
the proposal must undergo another public reading at a subsequent meeting , and then the council can vote on it , city officials said			0
some critics have found the measure inadequate			0
the proposed citizen board is " a step in the right direction , " but " it is very weak " in terms of how complaints against police would be filed , said @entity194 , a member of @entity196 board			1
" at the meeting , very little details were given regarding this board , as to who can sit on it , what type of qualifications they will need , how these people will be elected			0
" the day after the september 9 council meeting , dozens of protesters threatened to shut down a portion of @entity208 near @entity19 and threw rocks and bottles at police			0
about three dozen people were taken into police custody after refusing to leave the street , and four were charged with assault on a law enforcement officer .			0

a grand jury is hearing testimony into killing of @entity1
feds are conducting two civil rights investigations , which could last a year or more
@entity161 proposes a citizen board to work with police
but the proposal " is very weak " in terms of how complaints could be filed , @entity196 says
