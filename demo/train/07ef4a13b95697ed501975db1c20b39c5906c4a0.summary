-- more than 40,000 @entity2 have returned to the abandoned neighborhoods of @entity4 in the past six weeks , despite some of the heaviest fighting in months , the @entity1 high commissioner for refugees said friday			1
violence continued this week in @entity4 between @entity2 @entity9 fighters and @entity11 soldiers			1
they are part of more than a million residents who have been displaced by fighting , including 100,000 who fled to neighboring countries last year , according to the @entity1			2
most of those returning are families from @entity2 's southern and central regions , areas that are suffering from drought and renewed fighting , according to @entity24			1
they are now living in neighborhoods in northern @entity4 that had been abandoned over the past two years of conflict , the @entity1 agency said			0
part of the reason displaced @entity2 may be braving the violence and returning to the war - torn capital city is because of the recent pullout of @entity36 troops , who were blamed for indiscriminately killing civilians in @entity4 , a @entity2 journalist said			1
" the @entity11 [ @entity11 ] and [ @entity2 ] government forces only defend in their positions , they do n't move around , " according to @entity41			2
" this may reduce the fear of the civilians that their homes may be raided			0
" during the @entity36 presence , it was different : when their bases were attacked , they used to come and carry out search operations in which civilians may be detained , killed or wounded			0
" @entity41 also said another reason refugees may be returning is the bad conditions at the camps for internally displaced @entity2			1
" people had been living in very poor conditions in the makeshift camps on the road between @entity4 and @entity60 for the last two years , " @entity41 said			2
" so that is i think why people are returning			0
" those returning to @entity4 will have limited access to basic necessities , a problem that is compounded by the scarcity of international aid agencies , who have fled @entity2 because of the violence , @entity24 spokesman @entity63 said friday			1
" @entity24 is not encouraging returns to @entity4 at this juncture , as the security situation is volatile and the conditions are certainly not conducive , " he said			0
" nevertheless , we are preparing to help returnees or those who wish to return in the near future , in the hope that the security situation will improve			0
