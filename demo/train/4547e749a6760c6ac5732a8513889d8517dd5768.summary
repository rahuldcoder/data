-- on the surface , the first round of the @entity3 presidential election seemed to show that the @entity5 and the remnants of the @entity8 regime are locked in mortal combat for the political soul of @entity3 -- as @entity5 candidate @entity11 faces pro-military candidate @entity12 in a second round of voting in june			1
buying into this simplistic formula , however , would be a total misreading of the far more complex picture			0
to understand the political reality of @entity3 and the strengths and weaknesses of the major political forces operating in the country , one needs to look more closely at all of the electoral results			0
first , it is very clear that the @entity5 , despite @entity11 's emergence as the presidential front - runner , lost almost half its support base between the parliamentary and presidential elections -- from 47 % to 25 %			1
it is true that the well - organized @entity5 was able to mobilize its political base in the presidential elections more effectively than its competitors			1
but the support of a mere quarter of the electorate is nowhere near sufficient for the @entity5 to govern the country by itself			1
only part of this decline in support can be attributed to former @entity5 leader @entity41 's 2011 defection from the party and his decision to run for president as an independent			1
the decline also reflects a disenchantment with the @entity5 's poor legislative performance , its attempt to pack the constituent assembly with its supporters , reneging on its promise not to run a presidential candidate and its tendency to compromise with the military on important issues			1
the election results also demonstrate that the total @entity57 vote is somewhere around 40 % of the electorate			2
that might be overstating its strength			0
@entity62 garnered many votes from secular liberals who mistakenly considered him to be the anti-establishment front - runner			2
many voted for him to prevent @entity8 - era candidates @entity67 and @entity12 from winning			1
the real surprise of the election was the emergence of @entity72 -- whose campaign was built on nationalism and demands for social justice -- with 22 % of the vote			1
@entity72 was often referred to as the @entity79 candidate who represented the legacy of the @entity81 , the leader of the 1952 revolution and @entity3 's first president			0
his campaign did not get going until very late in the day ; otherwise it is more than likely that the runoff would have pitted him against @entity11			0
that would have given @entity72 a real shot at winning the runoff , given the @entity92 search for a viable candidate untainted by the @entity8 regime			1
@entity72 's performance in the first round indicates that many who voted for the @entity5 in parliamentary elections , especially the working classes , were disillusioned with its advocacy of a free market economy and lack of attention to social justice and welfare issues			1
@entity72 's message of social justice worked , as demonstrated by his lead in @entity109 's working - class district @entity110 , long considered a @entity5 stronghold			1
@entity72 carried the two most populous cities , @entity109 and @entity113 , without much organizational support -- a remarkable performance by any standards			0
the fact that pro-military @entity12 , the leading remnant of the @entity8 regime , took almost a quarter of the votes seems remarkable			2
but the superior financial capability and patron - client network of the former ruling party @entity123 , especially in the @entity124 , and covert support from the military brass played a big role			2
reports are emerging that the security services and military - linked @entity131 landlords coerced many of the @entity134 peasantry to vote for @entity12			1
it appears that pressure was also put on public servants and their families			0
@entity140 's law - and - order message also attributed to his success			0
the security situation in much of the country has deteriorated markedly -- some argue deliberately engineered by the military			0
but his performance can also be read as the last gasp of the old regime , which can be well and truly buried if its opponents , from the @entity5 to the @entity150 and liberals , can form a coalition capable of providing effective and legitimate government			1
this should not be an impossible task			0
it is clear that the @entity57 forces are fractured and the @entity5 's base is shrinking , as the political playing field becomes increasingly level in a democratizing @entity3			2
there are indications that the @entity5 is aware of its limitations , which has forced it to mellow considerably , sacrificing some of its ideological purity at the altar of political pragmatism			2
if the leaders of the various trends of political opposition to the @entity8 regime demonstrate adequate wisdom and put together a governing coalition that includes no remnants of the old regime , @entity3 's democratic experiment could be securely launched on the road to maturity			2
it is most important that the @entity5 and @entity72 's campaign come to an understanding that would allow them to share power , possibly with @entity11 as president and @entity72 as vice president of a democratic @entity3			0
the @entity5 must also give the @entity150 and liberals a voice in writing a new constitution that would guarantee the fundamental rights of citizens and delineate a process for orderly political transition , based on periodic elections for the executive and the legislative branches of government			1
a consensus will also have to be built on the role of @entity197 in the new political order			0
the @entity5 has demonstrated remarkable flexibility in the past on this issue			0
it may be even more flexible now that it realizes a consensus on @entity197 that is acceptable to the majority of political parties and factions would be essential to creating a coalition			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity209 .			0

@entity209 : @entity5 lost half its support between the two elections
the @entity5 ca *n't* govern by itself with support of only 22 % of electorate , he writes
@entity209 : @entity8 - linked candidate did well , but social justice *proponent* did well , too
liberals , @entity150 and @entity5 must form their own coalition , @entity209 writes
