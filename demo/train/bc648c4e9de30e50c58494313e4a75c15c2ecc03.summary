-- one of two wildfires burning in @entity2 on wednesday pushed north toward suburban @entity3 , illuminating the windy night sky with spirals of flame and flying embers			1
the fire broke out tuesday in the less densely populated northeast @entity2 and was moving in a northerly direction toward more largely residential , @entity3 fire chief @entity8 said			1
" the winds have shifted a bit , " @entity8 said			0
" it 's current path it 's going to travel through a heavily wooded area , which will allow the fire to grow in intensity			1
" he said it is hoped the fire can be stopped before it crosses @entity22 to the southeast of @entity3 , but the department had already initiated its @entity26 system , which autodials residents ' telephone numbers encouraging them to evacuate			1
about 380 residents were affected by the initial evacuation call , he said			0
" it 's real difficult to fight a fire like this when it gets to all those trees , " @entity8 said			2
" we ca n't get our rigs in			0
" he said that firefighters were getting support during the day from @entity40 helicopters equipped with water buckets , " but now that it 's dark , it 's up to the crews on the ground			0
" the northeast fire had claimed about 15 square miles since it broke out on tuesday			2
live aerial images from @entity0 @entity2 affiliate @entity47 wednesday night showed brilliant columns of flame bursting through tree canopies and threatening homes in a residential area			1
@entity2 fire chief @entity55 said firefighters had " pretty much " contained the northeast fire on wednesday before winds freshened and caused it to flare up anew			1
meanwhile , a fire that started wednesday afternoon in the southeast side of the city had destroyed two structures and caused some evacuations , he said			1
@entity55 said that fire covered an area 1.5 miles long and a mile wide			2
@entity47 reported that the evacuations from the southeast section covered a square - mile area			2
the fires forced closure of a 40 - mile section of @entity22 between the capital city and @entity74 , according to @entity75 , a spokesperson with the @entity76			0
@entity55 said that in the case of both fires , the evacuations have been targeted because the areas are not densely populated			0

like neighboring @entity86 , nearly all of @entity40 is suffering from a severe drought , with two - thirds under the most severe category , according to the @entity90 at the @entity91 .			0
