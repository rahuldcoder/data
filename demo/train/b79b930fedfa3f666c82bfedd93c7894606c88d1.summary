@entity0 -- graphic photos of the violent death of former @entity5 strongman @entity4 dominate most front newspaper pages on friday , amid a sense of relief that an end to the conflict in the @entity12 country is in sight			1
some tabloids effectively dance on @entity4 's grave			1
the headline in @entity18 tabloid in @entity19 has the headline : " that 's for @entity22			1
" in an editorial , the paper adds : " @entity19 forces should be very proud today as a liberated @entity5 celebrates the death " of @entity4			1
" our brilliant troops spearheaded the operation to end the dictator 's tyranny			2
the architect of @entity22 , who supplied the @entity33 with bombs and had @entity35 ( policewoman ) @entity37 murdered , died like a rat after being cornered in a drain			2
" six months after the killing of @entity42 , the world is rid of another madman			0
" even the left - leaning @entity44 recognizes the success of @entity47 's military campaign in @entity5			1
" after all the waiting , the killings and the tears , the wheel of history turned inexorably , and all who watched knew it would never turn back , " wrote the paper 's @entity48			2
" @entity56 had claimed another infamous scalp			0
the risky western intervention had worked			0
and @entity5 was liberated at last			0
" @entity60 's @entity59 reports the events of thursday as " @entity62 " for @entity47 after a seven - month - long campaign which has seen 26,000 sorties flown over @entity5			1
but it warns that @entity5 's new leaders , the @entity67 , must do all they can to avoid the country falling into the same state of chaos and anarchy which hit @entity72 in 2003 after the fall of @entity74			2
" the @entity67 has an obligation to put an end to the ragtag bands of rebels , to protect those @entity5 residents with darker skin than others , to forbid any wild behavior ; in short it must ensure the spirit of justice and reconciliation prevails over that of revenge			2
" in @entity89 , @entity88 ponders the question of how exactly @entity4 's end came about , reporting on the conflicting information about his capture and subsequent killing , and questioning whether he died " in the crossfire or at the hands of a lynch mob			1
" the @entity100 - based daily reports on the bizarre combination of character traits that made up the " poet and butcher " @entity4 , reporting that with his death , " the world has one less mass murderer and brutally inhuman dictator , but also one less paranoid ' bird of paradise			1
' " the @entity110 also hints at a sense of unease over the killing , commenting in an op - ed that " it might perhaps have been better " if @entity4 had been captured alive and put on trial			1
however it added that his death " has the merit of depriving the remnants of the old regime of a figurehead to rally round			2
" the @entity124 edition of the @entity125 reflects on what the @entity127 intervention in @entity5 shows us about the contenders for the @entity131 in next year 's presidential election			1
" mr. @entity134 's decision to keep a political low profile during the war -- to ' lead from behind ' -- hurt the cause			2
@entity47 was left without a political general , and at times it wobbled			1
the @entity139 was too late to recognize the @entity141 government , and mr. @entity134 's calculated reticence invited a backlash in @entity144 over war powers			0
" yet the president was a statesman compared with some @entity148 pretenders to the commander - in - chief 's chair			2
@entity151 , @entity152 and @entity153 opposed @entity139 participation as a high - risk intervention , a claim that now looks strategically mistaken and politically opportunistic			0
@entity157 , a @entity148 who never wavered on @entity5 , yesterday offered adult advice for the @entity139 now ' to deepen our support ' for @entity5 's coming move from dictatorship to something new			0
" it concluded by saying the world 's sole superpower " can still shape events for the better			0
" " @entity5 's successful revolution is the latest proof that liberating the world of a dictator can serve @entity139 's strategic interests and its moral principles			0
" in @entity19 's independent newspaper , @entity175 , who met @entity4 30 years ago , recalls how the former @entity5 strongman was alternately feted , then demonized by the @entity178 -- often with confusing haste			1
then we loved him again			0
then we hated him again			0
then @entity182 slobbered over her @entity183 and we really hated him even more again			0
let us all pray that he was n't murdered			0
' died of wounds suffered during capture			0
' what did that mean ? " he was a crazy combination of @entity190 and @entity191 ... and we who had to watch his ridiculous march - pasts and his speeches bit our lips and wrote about @entity5 tanks and marines and missiles that were supposed to take this nonsense seriously			0
his frogmen flipped and flapped through @entity201 in the heat and we had to take this rubbish at face value and pretend that it was a real threat to @entity206 ; just as @entity181 tried to persuade us ( not unsuccessfully ) that ( @entity4 's ) pathetic attempts to create ' weapons of mass destruction ' had been skewered			1
this , in a country that could n't repair a public lavatory			0
" finally across the @entity218 , another of @entity217 's tabloids , the @entity214 managed to produce one of the most bizarre front pages on @entity4			1
alongside a photo of one of @entity4 's alleged captors wearing a @entity226 baseball cap , the paper got in a cheeky critique of star player @entity229 's recent performances , with the sub-headline : " @entity231 had more hits than @entity229			1

graphic photos of violent death of @entity4 dominate @entity124 's newspapers
some tabloids effectively dance on @entity4 's grave . @entity18 headline : " that 's for @entity22 "
