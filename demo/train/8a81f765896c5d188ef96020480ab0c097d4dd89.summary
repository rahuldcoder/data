-- @entity1 has been touted as having the biggest , baddest , fastest @entity2 around			2
it 's been this way since the carrier debuted its lte network in late 2010			1
but now that @entity9 has joined the @entity6 game , consumers looking for top speeds might consider turning their focus to @entity9 instead			2
if only for a while			0
@entity13 , a firm that does network and mobile device analytics , took a look at @entity6 service in the @entity18 , focusing on two of the nation 's largest carriers , @entity1 and @entity9			1
the company 's latest report shows that @entity9 's average @entity6 speeds are better than @entity1 's ( for now at least ) , and that @entity6 provides more than five times the performance of the carriers ' respective 3g offerings			1
@entity28 used five @entity6 handsets for its tests : two on @entity9 , three on @entity1			1
on @entity9 , the @entity31 and @entity32 were measured			0
the @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity35 were tested on @entity1 's network			1
in stationary download speeds , @entity9 's @entity6 handsets outperformed those on @entity1 , but @entity28 believes this disparity is likely due to the fact that @entity1 's @entity6 service is more established and has significantly more subscribers using data on it			1
indeed , as of april , @entity1 had over half a million @entity6 subscribers			2
@entity9 , meanwhile , just launched its lte network in five markets this summer			1
but while @entity9 's data speeds were better , web pages actually loaded faster on the three @entity1 smartphones tested			1
" in general , the subscriber experience is not simply driven by the network or the device , but by the combination of the two , " the report states			0
" even devices with similar specifications connected to similar network technologies still demonstrate variation in performance			0
" this was especially true with regards to video performance			0
of the smartphones tested , the @entity34 ( on @entity1 ) consistently yielded the highest frame delivery rate , while the @entity35 ( also on @entity1 ) had the lowest			0
also , if you 're really concerned about web page load times , consider this : all carrier - to - carrier comparisons notwithstanding , both @entity9 and @entity1 handsets delivered web page load times that were 80 to 85 percent shorter on @entity6 relative to @entity75			2
what about battery life on an @entity6 device , notoriously reported as being poor ? well , depending on how you use your device , you may be able to squeeze out a few more hours , as the report found that battery life was heavily related to app use			2
on the @entity9 @entity32 , you 're going to get 300 to 350 minutes of use out of your device , whether you 're a power user or someone who 's making calls all day long			0
on the @entity89 , though , those who primarily use their phones for voice calling will gain about 150 minutes of usage over those who spend most of their time on @entity94 and @entity95			0
@entity1 's @entity6 network is currently the largest in terms of nationwide coverage , but @entity9 's is set to rival it as it expands			1
and , indeed , we 're finally beginning to see @entity6 infrastructure build - outs , industry - wide			0
joining @entity101 , @entity1 and @entity9 in the @entity6 game is @entity103 , perhaps best known for its budget mobile phone and prepaid plan options			2
cricket will offer speeds up to 6 @entity108 with a 5 gb data cap			0
@entity110 will begin rolling out its 4g lte network in mid to late 2012			1
