@entity0 sent fighter jets into its newly claimed air defense zone thursday , as @entity3 and @entity4 sounded notes of defiance by declaring they would continue to fly through disputed airspace without notifying @entity9			1
@entity4 announced yesterday it had already sent a military flight into @entity0 's newly claimed " air defense identification zone " ( @entity12 ) on tuesday without alerting @entity0 , while @entity3 appeared to claim it had also flown into the territory since @entity0 's announcement saturday that it was unilaterally establishing the zone			1
the flights have raised the stakes in a rapidly escalating dispute over contested territory in and above the @entity20			0
they follow @entity23 flights into the territory earlier in the week , when two unarmed b - 52 bombers passed uncontested through the zone , in what the @entity27 described as a pre-planned military exercise			0
col. @entity30 , spokesman for the @entity31 , said the @entity0 warplanes , including @entity33 and j - 11 fighters and an airborne radar early warning system , were flown thursday into the @entity12 in what he described as a " defensive measure ... in line with international practices			1
" the fighter jets conducted " routine air patrols ... aiming to strengthen monitoring on air targets in the zone and fulfill the air force 's historic mission , " @entity30 said in a statement posted on the @entity50 's website			0
@entity0 's military has been on " high alert , " he added , and was prepared to act " based on different air threats to firmly ensure air - defense safety			2
" opinion : @entity9 's foreign policy balancing act in the @entity20 an @entity12 is a unilaterally imposed buffer zone outside a country 's sovereign airspace , with scant recognition in international law , in which foreign aircraft can be requested to provide identification for entry into that country 's airspace			1
@entity0 's newly claimed @entity12 overlaps similar zones claimed by neighboring countries , including over the @entity69 , which have been at the center of a festering territorial dispute between @entity9 and @entity72			1
meanwhile , @entity4 announced yesterday its military had flown into the area tuesday on a routine patrol flight without notifying @entity0			2
a @entity77 official said the flights -- over a disputed submerged rock in the @entity80 , known by @entity4 as @entity81 and by @entity0 as @entity82 -- were regularly carried out twice a week , and would continue despite @entity0 's @entity12 declaration			1
the spokesman said @entity4 officials asked @entity9 at a meeting thursday to amend the boundaries of the new @entity12 so that there was no overlap with @entity4 's @entity12 , a request that @entity0 had rejected			2
@entity91 responded by saying it was considering expanding its @entity12 to protect its national interest , according to the official			0
@entity3 also signaled its rejection of @entity9 's move thursday , with chief cabinet secretary @entity96 telling reporters his country 's @entity98 had been continuing surveillance patrols of disputed territory in the @entity20 just as it had before @entity0 's declaration			1
" we have no intention to change this operation out of consideration for @entity0 , " said @entity96			0
" we will continue the surveillance / patrol operation with strong determination to protect our territory against @entity0 's one - sided attempt to change the status quo by force			0
" read more : why @entity0 's new air defense zone has incensed neighbors @entity0 has grown more assertive beyond its recognized borders since @entity0 president @entity116 took office in march this year -- creating a delicate situation for @entity119 , which has promised to focus more on @entity120 and uphold commitments to its allies in the region			1
" unlike his predecessors , @entity116 is making foreign policy with the mindset of a great power , increasingly probing @entity23 commitments to its allies in the region and exploiting opportunities to change the status quo , " @entity124 , director of @entity126 programs at the @entity127 , wrote in a commentary for @entity129 this week			0
the @entity23 and @entity3 have criticized @entity9 's air defense claim , saying it escalates tensions in the region and raises the risk of an incident			1
@entity0 hit back at those comments , describing the @entity23 and @entity3 statements as unreasonable and unacceptable , and saying @entity3 should first repeal its own zone , claimed more than 40 years ago			0
but in statements thursday , @entity0 's @entity147 spokesman @entity146 appeared to soften demands that commercial airliners passing through the airspace notify @entity0 authorities , saying the zone was not targeted at " normal " flights by international airliners			2
however , he hoped that airlines would cooperate with authorities , by providing flight plans and responding to radio requests for identification , as he said many airlines have begun to do			0
two major @entity3 airlines have already refused to comply with the request .			0
