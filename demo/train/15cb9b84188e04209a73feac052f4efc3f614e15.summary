-- the global appeal of football can hardly be doubted			1
it is said the membership of ruling body @entity5 exceeds that of the number of member countries in the @entity9			0
furthermore , football is attributed the status of being one of only two entities that are truly global languages			1
the passion of this sport has been known to halt armed conflicts and to unite rivals , all for the good of the " @entity23			1
" i venture that there is nothing within the sphere of the human social arena that can transcend or perhaps even challenge the passion and fixation associated with this truly global sport			1
more than a kick in the universal grass , football is a script that translates without interpretation , that amends without severe changes , that entertains an informed audience , and pleasures even the most casual and naive observer merely through its grace and simplicity			1
aside from its widespread appeal and acceptability , football provides opportunities for personal development , social exposure and travel			1
it is a tool for product marketing and even tourism			0
it is participatory with no regard to social and economic status			0
the impact of this great and wonderful sport is evidenced in the excitement of the pauper and through the accolades from the palaces of the royal fans			2
it is because of all these things , and more , that the " @entity23 " deserves to be respected , preserved and immortalized			1
arguably those players and administrators who have emerged as notables should be lionized ; some may even revere them as icons and deified gods			2
i will not lend myself to such lofty thinking			0
i am a mere lover of the " @entity23 " -- one who has trotted through the athletic portals and has been blessed to perform on its many green expanses			1
discipline is integral to successfully achieving in this sport			2
discipline to get there , discipline to maintain your performance , and discipline to sustain your humbleness as the benefits accrue			0
there is even the element of self - discipline to accept when your role alters , and to accept that neither you nor anyone else is bigger than the " @entity93			2
" challenges have always been present in this sport , and although some have mutated over time as the game became more global , others remain problematic			2
perhaps it is symptomatic of modern society that despite the diversity of practitioners and the potpourri of fans , the ugliness of racism seeps through			2
is it so ominous that we should shudder in fear ? is it so idiotic that we can attempt to minimize it by not diverting great resources towards its eradication ? after all it is only the ignorant and the inebriated that dare spoil this pristine scene			1
i offer this explanation : the " @entity23 " is not immune from the variances and the often pejorative behaviors that inculcate the minds of many in our community			1
the same unpredictability that causes people to riot at an event celebrating @entity129 or @entity130 -- the same mob mentality that sends fans crashing and burning all in their paths after their favorite team has triumphed in some distinguished competition -- is the same uncontrollable factor that leads to much of the racial abuse			0
we can do much in terms of our formal response			0
we can be infinitely creative in proactive initiatives			0
however , what has never been done -- and what will never be accomplished -- is to legislate an attitude			0
the hallowed sanctums of the " @entity23 " will survive because it is the " @entity23			1
" it is neither the cause nor the panacea of society 's ills			0
it is an avenue that has shown that it offers resiliency and relief come what may			0
respect it , enjoy it and it serves us well .			0
