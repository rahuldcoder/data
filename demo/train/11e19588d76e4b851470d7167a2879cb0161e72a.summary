-- a teenager who only picked up sailing to keep out of mischief while her mother worked at a yacht club has become a sporting success story in @entity6			1
@entity7 , 14 , won the bronze medal in the women 's laser radial sailing event at the @entity11 last year , and was subsequently named @entity12 at her country 's sports awards			1
her rapid success has seen her travel as far away as @entity17 and @entity18 to sail in tournaments -- a far cry from the humble village of @entity22 , from which @entity7 regularly makes the 40km trip to train at the @entity25			1
despite being blessed with thousands of kilometers of coastline , sailing is not a common pastime in @entity6 , a former @entity27 colony is south east @entity31			1
