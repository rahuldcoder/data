@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3			1
residents in this small hamlet at the eastern edge of @entity8 are exhausted and on edge			1
eleven days after @entity10 made landfall , flooding nearly all of the @entity8 , they are still cold and in the dark			1
huddled beneath blankets and with the car 's heat cranked up , 56 - year - old @entity14 has spent every night sleeping in his car since @entity3 left him homeless			1
" my place got washed out , " he said , adding that work and community ties have kept him from evacuating			2
" there 's nothing left			1
" parked by the liquor store where he works , @entity14 has squeezed in a few hours of sleep each night while keeping an eye out for looters			1
" i 'm a survivor , " he said with a certain @entity1 's swagger that now barely masks the slight quake in his voice			1
waiting for gas , he said , " i hope everyone on this line is a survivor too , because we 're all together now			2
" the frustration has boiled over at times			2
in @entity38 , @entity37 residents booed local and federal officials who came to address power restoration			1
" what are you doing for us ? " they shouted			2
earlier in the week , fistfights broke out at relief supply depots in @entity0 , @entity47 , just as the first snowfall of the year blanketed the region and ushered in fresh misery to those already battered by @entity3			2
many , like @entity14 , have had no choice but to eat meals that the @entity54 is handing out			2
" it 's all right			1
the military came through for me , " he said			0
" they 're not too bad			0
" clean , running water is also in shorter supply across the peninsula in the wake of the crisis			1
some residents were seen carrying buckets of water to wash down their toilets			1
others boiled water to drink later or use for cooking			1
still , gas remains the crucial thing here			1
cloaked in blankets and heavy clothing , shivering residents queued up at one of @entity0 's few fuel depots on thursday , often carrying two or three gas cans at a time			1
puffy winter jackets wrapped around young children who accompanied their parents rather than stay in damp , cold homes			1
and many commuters remained stranded as @entity38 rail lines remained down there and in @entity86			0
" a majority of people work in the city and there 's no transportation , " said @entity87 , 41 , whose home was badly damaged during last week 's storm			1
" you just ca n't get to work			0
" other residents , like 60 - year - old @entity97 , are using the fuel for generators			0
" i thank @entity102 for this gas , " @entity97 said after finally filling her gas can			0
in an effort to alleviate the long gas lines , police on friday began enforcing a new alternating fuel ration system in @entity1 and @entity38			1
drivers with license plates that end with a letter or an odd number can fill up friday			0
those with even numbers or zero can fill up saturday , and so on			0
authorities cut off @entity97 's electricity last monday , along with thousands of others , as a precaution ahead of @entity3			1
but unlike other storm refugees now holed up in warmer places with family and friends , @entity97 decided to stay put in her @entity0 home			1
" you have to stay , " she said			2
" if i leave , what would happen to my house when i got back ? " more than a week after floodwater rushed into her basement , destroyed her property and soaked her circuit box with salt water , there is still no clear sign of when power might be restored			1
meanwhile , the weather has been getting colder			0
" it was freezing last night , " she said			0
unfortunately , getting power back is not just matter of fixing substations and flipping a switch			1
city officials say electricians are now needed for homes like @entity97 's , whose house is flagged with a yellow sticker , so that electrical cabling and circuit boxes can be individually checked before the power grid is restored			1
that means contractors must go door - to - door checking houses , adding to the time it takes for the power to return , while temperatures drop			2
just down the street are the charred remains of more than 100 homes destroyed in an inferno that raged in the coastal community of @entity161 , making officials especially wary of the risk of electrical fires			0
more than a half million households are still in the dark across @entity167 and @entity1 , including nearly 40,000 homes on @entity8			1
without a clear timetable for restoration , the town is rife with speculation			0
and that effect has fueled mounting tension			0
" i 'm pissed , just like everybody else is , " said @entity175 , 55 , an iron worker who normally commutes to @entity176 but has been out of work since the storm hit			0
" the biggest problem really ai n't so much the electricity			0
it 's that no one knows when we 're going to get it			2
they wo n't even give you a ballpark figure , " he said			0
a @entity190 spokesman could not be immediately reached for comment regarding restoration of the @entity0 area			0
the utility 's website indicates there is " a long road ahead			2
" @entity190 has dispatched some 250 utility workers to the @entity8 , working 16 - hour shifts in a round - the - clock operation to get power restored			1
but soggy and salt - caked electrical panels and wiring in homes and businesses " could present unsafe conditions when re-energizing those areas or facilities , the utility says on its website			0
police are working with the @entity213 and the @entity54 to provide evacuation services and have set up heating areas for residents , while churches and aid groups hand out food and water			2
a nonprofit called the @entity222 donated the fuel , but its supplies are limited			0
" right now we have to clean up , so i do n't know if this is the place to be for people right now , " said @entity226 deputy inspector @entity225 , who described the surrounding damage as " unparalleled			0
" " i know people are attached to their homes and their neighborhood , but emergency services have to get in here			0
" earlier this week , the city opened a relief center a few blocks away in a building once submerged in five feet of water , bringing generators and gas to those still battling the cold			2
in @entity176 , only about 200 customers now remain in the dark -- a fact that does not escape most @entity0 storm victims			0
" they 're going about their lives , and we 're the ones at the end of the line , " said @entity87			0
" they did the city first and they just forgot about us			0

many on @entity1 's @entity8 are still without power and running water
one man is sleeping in his running car to stay warm and ward off looters
some say the most frustrating thing is not knowing when power will come back on
