-- money , husbands , record deals or a free stay at a celebrity sober living house			0
just when you thought there could n't be a more shocking trade - off for national exposure on a reality show , @entity11 brings you " @entity12			1
" the new series , set to make its debut november 28 at 9 p.m. , will feature 12 brides - to - be competing for a different plastic surgery each week as they prepare to walk down the aisle			1
despite " @entity12 's " unsettling tagline -- " the only show where the winner gets cut " -- the reality competition follows a surprisingly standard format : each week , the contestants will participate in a wedding - or relationship - themed challenge , such as picking the perfect dress , according to @entity26 , vice president of original programming and series development for @entity11 so what 's the grand prize ? the last bride standing will receive her dream wedding , paid for by the show , and the remaining procedures on a " wish list , " which she drafts at the beginning of the season with the help of dr. @entity40 , who appeared on @entity42 's " @entity41 " in 2004			1
the procedures will range from veneers and @entity44 to breast augmentations and tummy tucks			2
and like many reality competition shows , a winner is granted immunity each week and thus is exempt from competing the following episode			1
but , on " @entity12 , " immunity is also a form of " medical leave			1
" " [ @entity54 ] will wait until they 're ready to return -- doctor 's orders , " @entity26 said			0
" they wo n't participate in any part of the episode that could mess with recuperation			0
" but recovery time is not the only concern for dr. @entity61 , a board - certified plastic surgeon in @entity63 , @entity64 , who is not affiliated with the show			1
@entity67 says , " by competing in a show like this , patients might feel pressured to undergo surgeries they would n't have under normal circumstances			1
" that pressure , he says , can stem from contestants ' peers on the show , as well as the fact that the surgeries are free			1
" if a contestant is only interested in her nose , but every other woman around her is talking about her breasts , all of a sudden , she may feel pressure to do her breasts , as well , " @entity67 said			0
" it 's almost like a peer pressure spurred on by this competition			0
" @entity67 also said that major events , like weddings or reunions , sometimes cause people to evaluate their appearance			0
" who does n't want to look their best on their wedding day ? " @entity26 said			2
" plastic surgery is a taboo topic , and a lot of people support it , and a lot of people consider it a guilty pleasure , and a lot of people are against it			2
" he added : " a show like this could go different ways			2
at the end of the day , we 're making a really great show			2
" supporters and critics alike agree that " @entity12 " will most likely be a hit			1
" this is the natural , absurd next step for reality programming			2
... it has all the elements of what would be successful for a faceless demographic : bridal themes , aspiration themes , plastic surgery , " said @entity120 , the managing editor of @entity122 , a website that assesses print , online and broadcast media			2
" it 's going to be a huge hit in the way ' @entity135 ' was a huge hit , " he added			0
" it 's a train wreck to watch , but people will love to sort of feel better than the participants			0
" @entity140 , senior editor at @entity141 , said she 's worried the show will send a negative message to viewers -- " equating cash to plastic surgery			1
" " anyone emotionally unstable enough to desire that much plastic surgery really needs @entity44 for the soul , " @entity140 said			2
" they should be giving out therapy instead of nose jobs			0
... when you start planning a wedding to include lip [ injections ] and rhinoplasty in addition to flower arrangements , it 's almost as belittling to your groom as it is to yourself			0
" of course , " @entity12 " is not the first tv show about plastic surgery			1
" @entity41 " and @entity169 's " @entity168 " both followed subjects who went under the knife to modify their appearance			0
these shows are a double - edged sword for plastic surgeons , said dr. @entity173 , a practicing plastic surgeon in @entity174 , @entity175 , and president of the @entity177			1
" it puts plastic surgery in a possible negative light , in that it cheapens the value of surgery			0
... on the other hand , it does generate some talk -- both positive and negative , " @entity173 said			0
" from a marketing standpoint , any time your product is talked about generically , it may be somewhat beneficial			0
" and " @entity12 " is certainly generating talk			1
" in today 's entertainment landscape , the most absurd and crazy idea wins , " @entity191 said			0
" this certainly feels like the most absurd and crazy tv show in a long time			1

reality tv show will feature 12 brides - to - be competing for a different plastic surgeries
the winner will receive her dream wedding and the rest of the procedures on her " wish list "
" @entity12 " is set to make its debut november 28
