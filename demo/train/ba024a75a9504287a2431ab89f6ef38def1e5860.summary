the names , which some liken to slurs , spread everywhere -- triggering anger in the @entity3 as well as @entity4			1
last week , @entity5 , a tv station based in the @entity7 area , aired what it believed were the names of the @entity11 pilots			1
a @entity13 intern confirmed the bogus names -- phrases which sounded like " @entity16 " and " @entity17			2
" and hello , perfect storm			0
or as one blogger put it -- " an epic mind - blowing fail			0
" the crash of the @entity4 carrier had already hit racial notes -- with jokes mocking @entity27 driving or piloting skills and questions whether the crash had to do with the @entity4 culture			1
@entity3 comedian @entity32 quipped on his show , " now that we know the cause of that @entity37 crash was the pilots flying too slowly , i do n't want to hear another word about me doing @entity27 driver jokes			1
" his comment followed an array of similar jokes on social media			2
@entity45 of the " @entity45 " blog , said he was bracing himself for jokes after the crash			2
" it 's completely inappropriate especially because we 're talking about a tragedy			2
people died , people were seriously injured , " he said			0
the crash prompted speculation as to whether the @entity4 cultural deference to authority played a role in bringing the @entity59 777 down on the @entity7 runway on july 6			1
this is a hypothesis made about @entity4 airlines long before the @entity37 crash			1
a blogger at ask a @entity4 sarcastically asked : " what is it about @entity3 culture that contributed a local station with heavily @entity27 population to blindly buy the obviously false representation from the @entity13 ? is there an inherent deference to authority in @entity3 culture that contributed to this gaffe ? " the bogus names prompted the @entity4 carrier to say it would take legal action against @entity5 , because " it was their report that resulted in damaging the company 's image			1
" several legal and pr experts questioned the wisdom of the lawsuit -- which the airline later said it would not pursue , while others on @entity88 's discussion board questioned whether the joke was even racist			2
" ah yes , the " r " word : racism			0
and the " o " word : offensive , " wrote one commenter			2
a mildly clever person pulled a reasonably funny ( if insensitive - to the victims of the crash ) prank			2
" " i honestly believe nobody has a sense of humor anymore , and when someone does , they have to apologize for it			0
it was hilarious ! " another wrote			0
@entity37 wo n't sue tv station @entity27 - @entity3 advocates say that creating vaguely @entity27 sounding names to crack jokes about a deadly plane accident that killed three @entity114 girls is completely insensitive			1
" making up @entity27 names or mimicking foreign accents are not innocent forms of satire , " wrote @entity115 and @entity116 , of the @entity117			1
" doing so demeans and hurts			0
" racial jokes around the fatal air crash " are not benign , " said @entity122 , an associate professor of political science and @entity124 at the @entity125			1
" those kinds of jokes reflect a deeper view of @entity27 as culturally different and inferior , " she said			1
" that 's not a joke , that has material effects			0
it leads to a general sense , even those who are born here in the @entity3 , they simply do n't belong			0
" @entity122 says denying that something is racist is a sign of the times			0
" people are minimizing it as a joke , " she said			0
" in this particular period , many people claim that racism is a thing of the past , we live in a colorblind society , we should brush these things off			0
" the mocking of @entity27 names dates back to when immigrants arrived to the @entity3 , said @entity154 , founding director of the @entity155 at @entity156			1
" in the 19th century , many immigration officials who first greeted @entity27 migrants demeaned them , by first of all , making fun of their names because they could n't pronounce them properly , or assigning them names like @entity164 or @entity114 @entity165 , " he said			1
" anything foreign seems to be open season or free game , " @entity154 said			0
passengers begin legal action against @entity59			0
