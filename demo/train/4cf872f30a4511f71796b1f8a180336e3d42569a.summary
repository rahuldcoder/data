-- every year , millions of tons of milk deemed unsafe for human consumption are discarded in @entity4			1
now , a @entity6 company is turning the spilled milk into high - end fashion			0
@entity9 , a biochemist turned fashion designer , is the inventor of @entity12 -- a fabric made entirely of milk			1
" milk fabric has been around since the 1930s , but the process involved chemicals			1
@entity12 does n't , and it uses up fewer resources than natural fibers do , " said @entity9 , whose fashion label @entity20 is a favorite with stars including @entity23 and @entity24			2
the fabric is created from milk which is allowed to ferment before it is turned into a powder			2
it is then heated and mixed with other natural ingredients and turned into yarn			0
" to make one kilo of cotton takes 20,000 liters of water ... our process only uses two liters of water , " said the 29 - year - old entrepreneur , who hopes her environmentally friendly fabric will revolutionize the fashion industry			1
the fabric might use less water than cotton but it is far more expensive to produce -- @entity12 costs around $ 30 per kilo to produce , compared to $ 3.8 per kilo for cotton yarn			1
@entity12 has a similar feel to silk , and is marketed as a luxury fiber			2
but , unlike other labor intensive materials like silk -- whose commodity prices fluctuate depending on the markets and the weather -- the cost of @entity12 is expected to be stable , which @entity9 said is feeding into its popularity			0
" we are just ordering machines for producing 1,000 tons per year , " she said			0
" it is scaling up from producing two kilos per hour to 120 kilos per hour , " she added			0
the fabric , which @entity9 said is non-allergenic , is attracting interest outside of fashion			0
makers of hospital and hotel bedding , and even car upholstery firms , are keen to clad their products in the sustainable fabric formerly known as milk .			1
