@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 president @entity3 enjoys one of the highest popularity ratings of any leader in @entity7 , so much that his supporters are pushing for a third presidential term for him			1
@entity1 president @entity3 has not said whether he would be willing to run for a third term			1
but the constitution would have to be changed to allow that , and recent global issues have even some supporters questioning whether @entity3 should be allowed to seek that extra time in office			1
" when the president was first re-elected in 2006 , the economy was thriving , and the president benefited from its success , " said @entity17 , a political consultant			2
" now , the economy is in a very different situation			0
" five million @entity1 might disagree			1
they have signed petitions asking for a constitutional referendum that would grant @entity3 the chance to run again			1
that could happen in 2010 or , if he sat out a term , in 2014			0
the nation 's @entity30 is debating the referendum , and not all lawmakers are convinced it 's a good idea			2
" another re-election is not good for @entity1 , because it would concentrate the power of government on the president , " said @entity35 , a member of @entity1 's @entity36 , the lower house of @entity30			1
added representative @entity43 , " in 2001 , voters agreed @entity3 was the most qualified person for the job			1
but , like any other democracy , there are plenty of capable people for the job			0
and those people should get their chance			2
" the third - term argument in @entity1 mirrors to a large degree the situation in rival @entity52 , where president @entity53 announced last month that he will press for a constitutional amendment to enable him to seek re-election in order to govern until 2021			1
observers say the efforts to expand presidential terms reflect a historical shift in @entity7			0
" historically , those countries did not have re-election			0
the president could serve one term , and that was it , " said @entity64 , director of the @entity66 - based @entity65 , an independent research and information organization			2
" there would be military coups , with the military ousting one civilian ruler to put in another civilian ruler			0
then in the 1970s , the coups changed			0
the military seized power and held it and did n't turn authority over to civilians			0
so one country after another revised their constitutions to allow standing for re-election , " @entity64 said			0
" we now have a situation where ruling parties want to stay in power , but for different reasons			0
in the case of @entity1 and @entity3 , it is law and order			1
for @entity53 in @entity52 , it is extending his vision , getting more time to institutionalize that vision , " @entity64 said			0
in @entity1 , there is also talk of " vision " among congressional supporters of a third term for @entity3			1
" i believe president @entity3 's success requires us to consider the [ constitutional ] referendum and grant it , so that we can continue his vision of long - term stability , " @entity103 member @entity102 said			1
but former @entity1 president @entity110 believes that it is time for a change , and changing the constitution to allow for a third term is not the change he means			1
" i think that changing the constitution for someone 's personal gain is against our democratic principles , and it would be a grave mistake for this country , " he said			0
that is a risk that supporters of the referendum are willing to take			2
" it is not going to weaken our democracy , " supporter @entity127 said			0
" just look at @entity133 , who governed for 11 years , or @entity134 for 10 , " he said , referring to two former @entity132 prime ministers			0
as the debate goes on in @entity1 , @entity3 is not saying whether he wants another term in office			1
and opponents are arguing that it would not be worth spending an estimated $ 57 million on a referendum to find out whether he should even be allowed to be a candidate .			2

5 million @entity1 signed petitions seeking constitutional referendum
some say others *deserve* chance to run for president
supporters speak of giving @entity3 a chance to continue " vision "
