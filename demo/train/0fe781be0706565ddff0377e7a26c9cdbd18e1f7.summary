-- " the father of my child began cheating on me with this whore on july 14th , 2013 , " begins one post on the website " she 's a homewrecker , " on which scorned women publish the names , photos and , in some cases , contact information of women with whom their husbands and partners cheated , along with detailed narratives of how the affair went down			1
the website , which has 250,000 likes on @entity21 , operates under the guise of offering important reader service or , as the tagline goes , " exposing the women who choose to become involved with an involved man			2
" who knows if any of these affairs actually happened			0
but no words are minced here for the so - called " other women " who are , invariably , " life sucking whores , " " homewrecking sluts , " " tramps " and " skanks " who " stole " someone else 's man			1
but wait -- does n't it take two to tango ? of course it does			0
although sleeping with a married man is of questionable morality -- and that 's , of course , assuming the woman is even aware the man 's attached -- the job of staying faithful belongs to the man who took the vow			2
and yet on " she 's a homewrecker , " the men get off largely scot - free			1
they are not named or pictured			0
in many cases , they are forgiven , even in cases where the man " abandoned me and my child ... he then kicked me and our baby out of the house and onto the street to be with her , " as one woman writes			0
another woman writes about the " twit " who started " talking to her husband at work			0
" after the " twit " got pregnant with the husband 's baby , the woman says she and her husband fought for custody of the child and won			2
she writes : " our marriage is now the best that it ever would have been because we have worked through issues that we did n't even know we had			0
we are a happy family ... " despite this , the " homewrecker " still must pay , and does , in the form of having her name , details of her life and no fewer than six photos of herself splashed all over the site			1
the fact that this site exists , and was created by women with the sole intent of bullying and shaming other women , is especially notable given the recent discussions about how to deal with the problem of " revenge porn , " in which scorned people -- men , mostly -- post explicit , formerly private photos of their exes online without their consent			1
states are working to criminalize both the posting of such photos and the host sites , with advocates saying that under existing law , it 's nearly impossible to get remediation or the pictures removed			1
revenge porn exists to belittle and shame women and to " put them in their place			2
" but what 's happening at " she 's a homewrecker " is just as misogynistic ; that it 's women targeting women does n't make it any less so			1
bullying among grown women has often happened out of public sight : undermining in the workplace , whispers during the @entity131 meeting			1
although sleeping with a married man is of questionable morality -- and that 's , of course , assuming the woman is even aware the man 's attached -- the job of staying faithful belongs to the man who took the vow			2
as @entity143 told @entity145 magazine this summer , " we 're living in a time where , whether it 's the @entity149 or tabloids , being sh - tty has become a sport			1
" with revenge porn and sites such as she 's a homewrecker , the damage is tangible : intimate photos and character attacks that may turn up with a simple @entity158 search of a person 's name			1
despite the women 's stories of betrayal and humiliation and the sympathy they hope to elicit , humiliation is exactly what they intend to dole out , continuing the cycle of meanness			1
they play the victims while making victims of someone else , bullying others in the name of " just desserts			0
" the whole @entity177 of bullying is , of course , to gain leverage and power			0
at least some of the women posting on she 's a homewrecker do so , it seems , out of desperation to regain some of the control they lost when they were betrayed by their partners			1
but that does n't make their retaliatory actions defensible			0
for one thing , it does n't explain why the cheating men are n't taken to task			0
what 's happening on she 's a homewrecker is bullying			1
in many cases , it 's illegal -- it 's flush with defamatory comments -- and not without consequences			0
by turning on their own gender and by encouraging a community based on judgment and fear , women sabotage their ability to develop strong female relationships			0
they promote the idea that other women are untrustworthy			0
and so , instead of finding empowerment and community just when they need it most , women who use and read sites like these will end up feeling more alone than ever			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity221 .			2

betrayed women post details about partners ' *mistresses* on " she 's a homewrecker " site
@entity221 : " other women " called " life - sucking whores , " " skanks " who " steal " men
@entity221 : women never blame the men ; posts seem to be attempts to regain control
she says posting details , photos on " she 's a homewrecker " is simply cruel bullying
