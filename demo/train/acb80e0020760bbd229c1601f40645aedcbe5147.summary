-- the solution to ending an abusive relationship seems simple : walk out the door			0
but for an abused woman , leaving can be a confusing process , complex at every step , said a newly published article in an @entity9 journal			1
co-author and graduate student @entity10 told @entity0 that abused women actually go through a five - step process of leaving that involves denial , contemplation , preparation , action and maintenance			1

@entity34 said that physically leaving a relationship entails more than a woman 's decision to embrace change and prioritizing her own safety			1
the abuser can affect her decisions , as can children , who can motivate her to return to the relationship , @entity34 said			2
even though a woman may return to the abuser at some point , practitioners and women themselves need to understand that every time the woman disengages she gains additional resources and support , @entity34 said			2
" so next time she is contemplating and preparing she 'll be stronger and perhaps more likely to stay out of that relationship , " she said			0

" not all women are ready to leave , but recognizing it 's a process can be empowering , " she said .			1
