remember when flying used to be romantic and glamorous ? no ? back in the ' 60s and ' 70s , the airline industry had its challenges , but it also offered a lot of perks that travelers pine for today			1
like a full meal , served on real china , even in coach			2
like food that was more home - cooking than pre-packaged snack			0
like wide , comfy seats with plenty of leg room			0
it all made travelers feel like they were doing more than simply hurtling through the air from @entity16 to point b in a metal tube			0
it made them feel pampered			0
@entity21 proved that they were privileged			0

@entity22 admits that he 's obsessed with @entity23			1
visitors to the tourist attraction can see a collection of memorabilia that he 's collected his entire life , such as branded carry - on bags , colorful luggage tags and warm blankets			1
" i restored everything to look like it did back in the era of the ' 70s , when @entity23 was sort of in its heyday , " @entity22 said			1
the @entity23 takes place in an airliner " cabin " designed to look like the jumbo jets that @entity23 flew back in the day			1
there 's also a fake check - in counter			2
for aviation enthusiasts , it sure looks like fun			0
settle into seats that make today 's equivalent seem like furniture for hobbits			2
watch flight attendants glide through the cabin in retro uniforms			0
they wear hats ! they sport white gloves ! they greet each boarding " passenger " with a glass of champagne ! a time machine transports visitors to a day before humans ate with plastic sporks			0
the flight attendants will serve you a four - course meal , the old - fashioned way , with silverware			0
the only thing you ca n't do that you could do on planes back then is smoke			0
it will remind you how much the airline industry has changed			2
yet there 's one thing that has n't changed : the sticker shock			2
tickets for a @entity23 " flight " range from about $ 200 to about $ 300			1
the popularity of the @entity23 brand remains strong , decades after the airline went belly - up			1
@entity89 even tried a tv series in 2011 , starring @entity91 , about a group of @entity23 pilots and flight attendants who enjoyed the glamorous , globetrotting lifestyle of the emerging jet set in the 1960s			1
it appears the top - shelf passenger service of that era is gone forever , relegated to the likes of nostalgic tv dramas and specialty museums like the @entity23			1
