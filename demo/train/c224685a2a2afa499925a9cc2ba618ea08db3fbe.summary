-- the latest trend at teen parties is n't warm beer or prescription medicines pilfered from parents ' medicine cabinets			0
instead , increasing numbers of youths are turning to an herb - based product to get high , and unlike marijuana , it 's perfectly legal			1
it 's known as @entity13 or @entity13 , a synthetic substance that , when smoked , gives users a marijuana - like high , according to drug authorities			1
its growing popularity is causing increasing alarm among health care professionals , law enforcement authorities and lawmakers , with one @entity24 official calling its use the equivalent of " playing @entity28 roulette			0
" should some illegal drugs be legalized ? manufactured in @entity30 and sold online or in local stores , @entity13 and similar substances are marketed as herbal incense			1
a disclaimer on a @entity13 - selling web site reads : " @entity37 products are novelty incenses and are not for consumption			1
" sold in various flavors in 3 - gram bags , the product consists of herbs that are sprayed with synthetic substances that mimic @entity45 , the high - causing natural chemical found in marijuana			1
a call to regulate @entity13 health and drug officials say the danger in using such products is the unregulated nature of their production and makeup			1
" our biggest concern is that this particular chemical is likely manufactured in a dorm - room setting			0
and these dorm - room scientists are not going to be exhibiting a lot of quality assurance techniques , " says dr. @entity59 , a toxicologist and head of the @entity61			0
as a result , there 's a potential for users to inhale contaminants along with the substance they think they 're smoking , @entity59 said , which may be a contributing factor in the adverse symptoms some of its users have been experiencing			0
political activist wants @entity13 banned " synthetic drugs and herbal drug products like @entity13 and @entity13 are not made in a controlled environment and thus you are playing @entity28 roulette when it comes to these types of products , " said @entity79 , a spokeswoman for the @entity24 , which first began receiving reports about abuse of the substance last year			1
" there is no way , outside of a controlled laboratory environment , to determine the chemical makeup , synthetic ingredients or amounts , and therefore there is no way to determine with any accuracy what the potentially harmful effects may be			2
" @entity59 says his center first heard of the substance in december when @entity106 hospitals began reporting patients who had used @entity13 or @entity13			2
since then , the center has seen a spike in cases , with 20 people -- mostly teenagers -- visiting emergency rooms with such symptoms as heart palpitations and respiratory issues			1
in the most serious case , an otherwise healthy teenage boy , who has since recovered , lapsed into a coma , @entity59 said			0
according to @entity79 , additional side effects can include panic attacks , hallucinations , delusions , vomiting , increased agitation and dilated pupils			1
around the center , @entity59 said his employees have begun referring to the substance as " @entity128			0
" earlier this month , @entity129 became the first state to ban synthetic marijuana			2
@entity129 state sen. @entity132 , a supporter of the effort , said the ban was prompted by reports of abuse of @entity13 and similar products in cities across the state among high school students and prison parolees who were using it as an alternative to pot to avoid a positive drug test			1
lawmakers in several other states are considering similar legislation , including @entity106 , @entity148 , @entity149 , @entity150 , @entity151 , @entity152 and @entity153			2
" although it is a synthetic drug , it is still a drug with a high potential for abuse , " says @entity132 , who is a physician			0
" it was our desire in @entity129 to be ahead of the problem			0
" @entity13 has already been banned in some @entity161 countries , including @entity162 , @entity163 , @entity164 and @entity165 , and the @entity24 lists it as a drug of concern in the @entity168			2
" we are seeing several indications that these @entity45 - like substances could become a significant problem both domestically and internationally , " @entity79 says			0
she says the agency is in " the preliminary stages of determining whether or not some or all of ( synthetic substances ) need to be controlled			0
