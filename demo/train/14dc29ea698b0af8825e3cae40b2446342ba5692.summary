@entity0 -- in scenes that would not have been out of place in a @entity10 science fiction thriller , at dawn on march 31 , 2003 , armed police and @entity0 health authorities dressed in biological suits , theater masks and surgical gloves descended on @entity13 housing estate			1
working swiftly on an order from the @entity16 to isolate @entity17 , the residents were sealed in			1
under 24 - hour medical surveillance , they could neither leave the block nor receive visitors , according to a report from the @entity0 @entity16			1
later moved to confinement camps under quarantine laws that had not been invoked since an outbreak of bubonic plague in 1894 , the residents of @entity13 were locked out for 10 days as doctors , clinicians , sewerage experts and engineers scoured the block for clues			1
but even before @entity17 could be quarantined , police were on a manhunt for 147 residents who had already fled the infected apartment block -- to hotels or to stay with family or friends -- possibly spreading the virus into the community			2
if @entity43 ( @entity43 ) -- then a new and barely understood type of pneumonia -- demonstrated anything , it was that rumor and panic spread almost as fast as the virus			1
" @entity52 , proactive communication that provides accurate information in a timely fashion is certainly one of the lessons of @entity43 and to some extent this was implemented during the ( swine flu ) pandemic of 2009 , " said professor @entity49 of the @entity50 at @entity51			1
" but there were even lessons to learn from 2009 because communicating like this in a crisis is difficult and challenging precisely because you are in a situation of grossly imperfect knowledge , " he said			0
in the case of @entity13 , epidemiologists and health authorities were faced with a serious dilemma -- find out how the deadly virus was spreading , but contain panic that could send more infected people into the wider community			1
almost immediately , worried residents filled the information vacuum themselves , launching the website sosick.org			2
collecting information from residents on infected buildings , the website was able to record the spread of @entity43 from @entity13 to nearby @entity84 a week ahead of the authorities , according to reports at the time			1
but if government information on the @entity93 outbreak was perceived to be lacking , the investigation ( conducted at speed ) to establish how the disease was spreading was a masterpiece of medical detective work			1
while people in @entity0 had been coming down with the virus at the rate of 50 a day , the infection could be traced to contact with a person showing symptoms of the disease			1
now , at @entity103 , more than 200 people had contracted the virus almost overnight and their only connection was that they lived vertically above or below each other in the same apartment block			0
ultimately , a total of 329 residents at @entity13 came down with @entity43 and 42 were to die , 22 of them at @entity17 ,			1
within 24 hours a team of experts found evidence the building 's sewerage was involved in the vertical spread of the virus			0
intense diarrhea from one of the patients -- a 33 - year - old @entity120 resident in @entity0 for kidney treatment and identified only as patient @entity122 -- was believed to have spread the disease through defective piping in the building			2
according to the @entity16 , a break in e block 's flush - water system earlier that month had meant the water - sealed s - bend in some of the apartments ' toilets had been dry for an extended period , allowing virus - laden droplets to collect from the system 's soil pipe			0
bucket flushing by residents may have disturbed and released contaminated droplets , government agencies said			0
similarly , exhaust fans may have sucked droplets into bathrooms where the virus was deposited on floor mats , towels , toiletries and toothbrushes			0
even then , the government had to work quickly to quash panic sparked by medical conjecture that exhaust fans had drawn contaminated droplets into the building 's light well , a disturbing development , if it had been true , that would have meant the virus was airborne			2
for @entity0 's government , @entity13 was a turning point			1
" the general public expects things to be cut and dried with clear answers -- obviously that may not be possible all the time			0
the lesson is that one really needs to be upfront in communicating uncertainty , " @entity49 said			0
@entity166 , director general of the @entity168 , but then head of the @entity0 @entity16 , said the fight against @entity43 was a triumph of dogged medical work			1
" @entity43 taught the importance of meeting an emergency with whatever tools are at hand , " she told the @entity173			2
" @entity43 was a 21st century disease in its mode and speed of spread			2
but it was eventually defeated using the 19th century tools of case detection , contact tracing , isolation and infection control			0
" in terms of epidemiology , the study of the spread of diseases , the lessons from @entity43 were that the categories of epidemic diseases and their modes of transmission may never end			2
@entity43 was believed to have originated in civet cats at the exotic food markets of southern @entity200 , leaping the species barrier through human contact , possibly even through the food chain			0
according to professor @entity206 , the head of the @entity207 at @entity51 , the spread of disease does not just work in one direction			0
virologists , he said , are now looking at how viruses pass , not just from animals to humans , but from humans to animals and then back to humans again			0
" @entity43 was a wake up call , not just to @entity0 but to the rest of the world and what it showed us is that the world of infectious diseases is ever present			1
microbes will always be with us and we can never proclaim -- as we did in the 60s and 70s -- that the book on infectious diseases is closed , " @entity206 said			0
" it reminds us that human health and veterinary health are one and the same thing and we need to be constantly vigilant , " he added			0
" we are linked to animals not just by contact but also by the food chain and the latest horse meat scandal is a good illustration of that			0

@entity0 housing estate @entity13 was center of 2003 @entity43 outbreak
authorities had to work fast to isolate the virus and quarantine residents
the events at @entity13 *underscored* the difficulties of containing epidemics
public information an important part of the fight against epidemics
