-- @entity2 drivers threatened to boycott the @entity4 gp this weekend if the tire problems which blighted the @entity7 round at @entity8 are repeated			1
the @entity9 ( @entity9 ) issued a statement after a meeting thursday to " express their deepest concerns " over the events sunday which saw five drivers , including race leader @entity15 , suffer high speed blow outs			1
manufacturer @entity17 promised prompt action after the chaotic scenes and new tires will be used , which feature a @entity23 belt rather than the steel one previously used , apparently offering better protection from punctures			1
teams have also been banned from tire swapping and have been told to adhere to limits on tire pressures			2
" we trust that the changes made to the tires will have the desired results and that similar problems will not occur during the @entity4 gp weekend , " said the @entity9			1
" we are ready to drive our cars to the limit , as we always do , and as it is expected by our teams , sponsors and fans			0
" aside from @entity15 , who battled back to fourth place behind victorious @entity42 teammate @entity41 , @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 and @entity46 were also affected , with four of the drivers suffering the same left rear tire blow out			2
the stars of the grid said that if similar events manifested themselves at @entity52 then they would not hesitate to pull out of the race			0
" we shall immediately withdraw from the event , as this avoidable problem with the tires endangers again the lives of drivers , marshals and fans , " ended the statement			0
earlier , @entity63 ace @entity62 , who narrowly avoided serious injury when debris from @entity45 's puncture nearly hit him at high speed , said he was keeping his fingers crossed that the problems will be eradicated by the new measures introduced by @entity17			1
" at the moment , we ca n't make any predictions , because no one has tried them and we do n't know what and how many benefits they can bring , apart from trusting in the fact that it wo n't be dangerous to race , " he told the official @entity63 website			0
" let 's hope that means all drivers can race in safe conditions , " he added			0
@entity62 , second in the title race , will be hoping the triple defending champion @entity85 will extend his run of failing to win his home grand prix , despite his incredible success of recent seasons in the @entity91			2
the 26 - year - old @entity4 secured his first podium finish in @entity2 at the 2009 race but has not improved on that result			1
" surely , it is special , " he said			0
" in terms of championship points , it is the same as every other place , but it is something special to race in front of your home crowd , " he told the official @entity2 website			2
