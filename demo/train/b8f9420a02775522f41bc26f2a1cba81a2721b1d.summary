-- nothing gets conspiracy theorists going more than a passenger plane crashing under mysterious circumstances			1
in the absence of hard information to explain such disasters , people look for answers , and the disappearance of @entity11 early saturday could prompt the same response			1
@entity13 fell out of the sky on july 17 , 1996 , shortly after leaving @entity15 , killing all 230 people on board			1
recovery and investigative efforts were hampered because @entity13 went down in the @entity20			2
some soon posited that terrorists armed with surface - to - air missiles had brought down the plane			0
this theory seemed to be bolstered by eyewitness accounts such as that provided by @entity27 , who said she saw something streaking up toward the doomed plane			0
" i thought it was something on the beach going straight up			0
" three months after the @entity38 crash , former @entity35 correspondent @entity34 , who had once been president @entity36 's press secretary , weighed in at a news conference that a @entity41 ship had brought down @entity38 800 with a missile			0
@entity34 came to this conclusion because of a document on the internet making this claim			0
@entity47 , the former vice chairman of the @entity48 , said of @entity34 , " he was an idiot			0
... he did n't know what he was talking about , and he was totally irresponsible			0
" opinion : why so few clues about missing @entity55 flight ? after a four - year investigation , the @entity48 ruled that the @entity13 crash was caused by " an explosion of the center wing fuel tank , resulting from ignition of the flammable fuel / air mixture in the tank			1
" three years after @entity13 went down , @entity63 left @entity15 and soon plunged into the @entity20 , killing more than 200 people on board			1
two competing theories about what happened emerged			2
the @entity48 , widely regarded around the world as the most authoritative investigator of plane crashes , concluded after a three - year investigation that one of the @entity74 pilots , @entity72 , had intentionally downed the plane			2
@entity48 pointed to the fact that the downward trajectory of the plane was inconsistent with mechanical failure			0
based on the recovered cockpit voice recorder , @entity48 also underlined @entity72 's constant use of the phrase , " i rely on @entity85 , " and his lack of surprise when the passenger jet suddenly began descending			1
in @entity74 , this was not a popular view , and @entity74 officials pointed to supposed mechanical failure as the cause of the crash			0
the conspiracy theories that developed around @entity13 were caused by unreliable eyewitness accounts and @entity94 rumor - mongering			1
in the case of @entity96 900 , @entity74 officials would not accept that an @entity74 pilot would commit suicide , killing many others , and came up with an alternative explanation for which there was scant evidence			0
in the case of the downing of @entity106 , there was a deliberate effort to inject a conspiracy theory into the narrative of the events			2
@entity111 103 blew up over @entity112 on december 21 , 1988 , because of a bomb in the hold , which killed 270 on board and others on the ground			1
@entity118 , who presented himself as a former @entity120 counterterrorism official , was hired by @entity111 to investigate what happened			2
in his report , @entity122 claimed to have proof that the murder of the passengers on @entity106 was the result of a @entity129 sting operation that went awry , an assertion for which there was not a shred of evidence			0
yet a piece partly based on @entity122 's fairy tale then ended up as a cover story in @entity138			0
the @entity140 government later concluded that the attack was ordered by the @entity143 government , something the @entity143 would eventually concede was , in fact , true			2
the @entity38 800 , @entity63 and @entity111 103 cases represent the likely range of reasons that brought down @entity11 : mechanical failure , pilot actions or terrorism			1
based on these past cases , we should be careful not to allow conspiracy theories about what happened to get too much play			1
the truth will come out only after a careful and lengthy investigation .			1

@entity11 disappeared early saturday with more than 200 aboard
@entity161 says passenger jet disasters lead often to conspiracy theories
he notes that people *questioned* government findings on @entity13 and @entity111 103
@entity169 : the truth will come out after a careful and lengthy investigation
