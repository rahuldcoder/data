-- this is the summer of @entity2			1
the @entity3 have become a viral hit with their " @entity5 " videos			1
no matter how hard some people -- notably @entity8 -- have tried to kill the trend of musicians using computers to make their voices sound like whiny robots , @entity2 technology continues to ride a cultural high			1
now the voice - altering effects are migrating from recording studios to @entity18 and mobile phones			1
an @entity21 app called " @entity25 " lets people manipulate their voices to sound like the popular rapper and @entity2 advocate			1
the @entity3 , a sibling band out of @entity26 , @entity27 , has become a hit on @entity18 with a series of videos that @entity2 cable newscasts and political speeches			1
the group , which also tours as a low - fi soul band , started its series of videos called " @entity5 " during the 2008 presidential debates and has gained millions of fans in recent months			1
@entity0 spoke with @entity39 , a 27 - year - old member of the band , about the popularity of @entity2 -- the trademarked name for the popular pitch - correction software -- and the role of technology in music and society			1
the following is an edited transcript of our conversation : why do you think your videos have taken off like they have ? i think with any sort of viral video there 's a little bit of luck involved			0
so we 're counting our lucky stars that we 've been lucky enough to have it take off like that			0
at the same time i think the novelty of seeing people like @entity68 and @entity69 sing has really captured peoples ' attention			1
how do you make the videos ? what actually goes into it ? @entity75 likes to joke that there 's a huge @entity2 lever that he hooks up to his computer and whenever he sees video footage he just pulls the lever , and anything that strikes his fancy is automatically @entity5 - tuned			1
but there 's a lot of technical stuff that goes into it			0
... we scour a lot of footage to see what 's going to work and what 's not going to work			0
we try to find what people are going to tune well and what people wo n't tune well			1
... really , by the time the video gets made i 'd say it 's eight or 10 days of work that goes into one of these videos , between the four of us			0
what makes someone a good candidate for @entity105 ? an example of a great candidate for @entity105 would be either @entity68 or @entity108			1
both @entity68 and @entity108 have just continued to astonish us with their unbelievable , almost hidden melodies in their speaking voices			1
a lot of it has to do with how they project their voice in terms of their soft palate			2
but it also has to do with how much of an oratorical fashion they speak			0
@entity108 , in a lot of his speeches , is delivering them in a preacher sort of fashion that tunes really well			0
while someone who ended up tuning really poorly -- we thought he would tune really well ! -- was @entity131			1
we thought he 'd tune really well just because @entity131 is always talking really loud			2
but it turns out that despite the fact that he was talking really loud , it was a nasal talking and it was a harsh and abrasive loud voice , so it ended up not tuning well at all			2
does president @entity135 make for a good @entity2 ? you know , what was great from @entity135 was the campaign speeches			1
his campaign speeches were excellent , because he was sort of using that almost gospel - preacher rhetorical style			2
since he 's been president , he 's been so relaxed and sort of so laid back and cerebral and sort of intellectual			0
he 's not been quite as excellent for @entity105 because there 's a lot more of a mumbly tone about him			0
a lot less of the " yes we can ! " and a lot more of the " @entity152 , as we see ... " has " @entity5 " helped your other musical efforts or do you think it 's pulling you away ? it 's certainly making us focus a lot more on " @entity5			2
" as the videos have sort of grown in scope and become more popular , we ca n't help but continue to work on them as our fans clamor for more			2
do you ever use @entity2 in the other performances , like in your band ? we 've never used it live			1
but i think we 've used it a little bit on our record			0
right now it 's a huge fad to @entity2 the crap out of people so that they sound like robots			1
but on pretty much any record you listen to these days there 's some level of @entity2 on it , even if it 's a very , very small amount			2
if there 's just one small note that 's just a little bit flat , why would n't you @entity2 it to make it sound ok ? do you think it 's hurting music at all that people expect a singer 's pitch to be perfect ? it means that people who ca n't sing as well are becoming famous singers			1
but i do n't know , that 's why i love going to see live music , because that really sorts out the real singers from the not - so - real singers			1
if you could invent any technology or pick a technology that you would like to see invented , what would it be ? oh , wow			2
i 'd probably go for a teleportation machine myself			0
... like the one they used in " @entity197 , " hopefully , right ? where you can jump in the teleportation machine and get to your gigs without having to carry all your amps and drive eight hours in your van			0
i mean , i play music for free			0
it 's carrying my amps and driving places in my van that i have to charge people for			2
that 'd be the real revolution for the music industry			0
do you have the @entity21 app ? yeah , we were beta testers for that app. do you use the app in day - to - day life ? we 've been joking around and showing it to friends who did n't have it yet			1
but we 're playing our first concert in a while tonight [ september 11 ]			0
and we 're going to try to hook our iphones up to the sound system and we 're going to try to @entity227 our voices live			1
so we 'll see if it works			0
do you have a favorite @entity21 app just in general ? i 'm not much of an app guy , but when i really need to kill some time i go for @entity233			0
it 's like the simplest , dumbest game possible on the @entity21			0
other than that , the @entity237 app is nice			0
what have you learned about the internet in watching your videos go viral ? i think a lot of people are using the internet for just a sort of quick laugh fix			0
whether you 're bored at work or looking for something fun to do at home , people sort of live serious enough lives			2
i think everyone loves to laugh			0
and if you can get five minutes of the day at work ... to get a couple yucks in , i think you 'd rather do that than watch your latest @entity18 conspiracy movie or something .			0

@entity0 talks with @entity39 , one of the people behind " @entity5 "
