@entity0 -- the @entity2 focused wednesday on whether " evolving standards of decency " in the @entity9 forbid a resumption of capital punishment for any felony but murder			1
but the justices offered no clear indication of how they will rule in the case of a man who is on @entity15 death row for raping a child			1
@entity17 , 43 , is on @entity15 's death row for the rape of his 8 - year - old stepdaughter			1
" the trend since 1995 has been more and more states are passing statutes imposing the death penalty in situations that do not result in death " to the victims , said chief justice @entity21 , who appeared to support the state 's position			2
justices @entity31 , @entity33 and @entity34 expressed concern about applying the death penalty fairly			1
" it gives tremendous discretion to the prosecutor to pick and choose who should be executed , " @entity34 said , summarizing the position of death penalty opponents			1
he wondered whether degrees of child abuse could be capital eligible , including molestation not involving intercourse			0
@entity17 , 43 , would be the first convicted rapist in 44 years to be executed in a case in which the victim was not killed			2
he was sentenced to die in 2003 for sexually assaulting his 8 - year - old stepdaughter in her bed			1
in addition to severe emotional trauma , the attack caused internal injuries and bleeding to the child , requiring extensive surgery , @entity15 prosecutors said			2
both in 1976 and a year later , the @entity9 @entity2 banned capital punishment for rape -- and , by implication , any other crime except murder			1
but 19 years later , @entity15 passed a law allowing execution for the sexual violation of a child under 12			1
state lawmakers argued that the earlier high court cases pertained only to " adult women			0
" in oral arguments wednesday , @entity17 's lawyer , @entity70 , faced spirited questioning from several conservative justices			2
" our jurisprudence just requires the narrowing of the death penalty to be [ for ] particularly heinous crimes , " justice @entity74 said			2
" and one could say the rape is in and of itself particularly heinous , rape of a child of 12 or under			0
" but @entity70 said @entity15 's law " is particularly at odds with national values " on whether the death penalty should be expanded			1
the high court has in recent years banned execution for the mentally retarded , underage killers and those receiving an inadequate defense at trial			1
those exceptions drew a good deal of interest from the justices in the one - hour argument over what the trend now is			0
" what about treason ? " asked justice @entity100 , a possible swing vote			1
he noted that the @entity104 generally opposes the death penalty , except for treason			0
" you can slaughter your fellow citizens , but if you offend the state , you can be put to death			0
" and @entity111 solicitor general @entity110 told the high court that " few evolving standards are more pronounced than the growing understanding in modern society of the unique and irreparable harm caused by violent child rape			0
" @entity118 , @entity119 , @entity120 and @entity121 have long had death - penalty laws for rape but have not applied them in decades			1
@entity111 enacted a version in june , but no defendant has been designated death - eligible for child rape in any state but @entity15			1
@entity111 and other states have submitted a " friend of the court " brief in the case , supporting @entity15 's position			2
@entity17 recently was joined on @entity15 's death row by another child rapist , @entity135			1
@entity135 ' legal appeals have barely begun			0
arguing for the state , @entity137 , @entity138 assistant district attorney , described in some detail the injuries suffered by the victim in an attack @entity144 called " savage			0
" in their appeal , @entity17 's lawyers repeatedly raised the issue of skin color and whether that has played a factor in the political and legal debate over expanding capital crimes to include rape			1
@entity17 and the victim are both african - american			2
@entity157 of the @entity158 cited @entity160 statistics that all 14 rapists executed by @entity15 in the past 75 years or so were @entity162			2
nationwide from 1930 to 1964 , nearly 90 percent of executed rapists were black , he said			0
but race did not come up in court wednesday			0
no one in the @entity9 has been executed for rape since 1964			0
other state and federal crimes theoretically eligible for execution include treason , aggravated kidnapping , drug trafficking , aircraft hijacking and espionage			0
none of these crimes has been prosecuted as a capital offense in decades , if ever			0
supporters of @entity15 's law say that besides murder , no crime is more deserving of the death penalty , and that the punishment would be used only in the most heinous of circumstances			1
death penalty opponents contend , among other things , that it could give attackers a reason to murder their victims			0
a ruling is expected by late june			0

@entity2 banned execution for rape in 1970s , but @entity15 law *differs*
