@entity0 , @entity1 -- the father of @entity5 student @entity4 says prosecutors have " no case left , " after an @entity1 judge rejected a request for new dna testing of evidence			1
" it really appears to me that they want to find the truth , " @entity12 said of judge @entity14 's decision wednesday			1
" i 'm very hopeful that by the end of the month , we 'll be able to bring @entity4 and @entity20 home			1
" @entity4 is fighting her conviction for killing her @entity24 housemate , @entity25			1
@entity12 and her ex-boyfriend , @entity26 , were found guilty of the killing in 2009			1
the judge also rejected prosecution efforts to introduce newly found records about the original testing and to hear a new witness -- all victories for @entity12 's defense , which opposed the motions			1
@entity12 said his daughter is " handling it a step at a time			1
she 's not pessimistic by any means			0
but she 's also not saying , you know , i 'm coming home			0
" he told @entity2 that the family will be allowed to see @entity4 on friday and will have a better sense of her reaction to the court 's decision then			0
still , he acknowledged that " it was very good news for @entity4			0
" even the prosecutor 's office told @entity2 that its attorneys are less certain of the outcome			0
the prosecution is still confident that the verdict will be upheld , but is aware that it could go either way , the office said			0
but @entity58 , an attorney for the @entity60 family , said that the rulings were not a defeat and that he understood why the judge rejected the requests			1
the judge adjourned the hearing until september 23 when final arguments are expected to begin			0
the earliest possible verdict date is september 29 under a timetable the judge released wednesday			0
@entity12 and @entity26 were found guilty of the killing two years after @entity60 's semi-naked body was found in the house they shared in @entity0			2
@entity12 was sentenced to 26 years in prison , while @entity26 got 25			2
a third defendant , @entity25 , was convicted in a separate fast - track trial			2
@entity12 and @entity26 are appealing their convictions together , having been convicted in a joint trial			2
attorneys for @entity12 and @entity26 this week have worked to cast doubt on dna evidence found on the knife and @entity60 's bra clasp			1
dna on the knife used to kill @entity60 could not have been from blood , a forensic expert testifying for @entity12 's defense told the court wednesday			1
@entity90 , one of @entity1 's best - known forensics experts , presented a detailed technical argument about the dna on the knife			1
prosecutors in 2009 said there were traces of @entity12 's genetic material on the handle and @entity60 's in a tiny groove on the blade			2
@entity100 , another defense witness , testified wednesday that @entity26 's genetic material could have gotten onto the bloodied bra if it was on @entity12 's clothes when they were washed with @entity60 's before the killing			1
other experts working for the defense argued this summer that the @entity108 allegedly found on the bra clasp should be " inadmissible			0
" @entity110 and @entity111 said the clasp was " dirty " and had been allowed to rust , making further testing futile			0
@entity110 has also testified that tests for blood on the knife were negative , and that the amount of @entity87 said to be @entity60 's was so low , it could not be examined again with any conclusions			2
but @entity1 state police forensic expert @entity120 defended tuesday the methods and the equipment used in the investigation			2
@entity120 said the machine used for the @entity87 examination was clean and rejected suggestions the clasp had been contaminated			0
she said it had been moved but not turned over or stepped on at the scene			0
@entity2 's @entity130 and @entity131 contributed to this report .			0
