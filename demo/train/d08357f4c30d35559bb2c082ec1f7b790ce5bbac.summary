-- news that the @entity2 has a man in custody who has implicated himself in the 1979 disappearance of @entity6 raises the tantalizing possibility that this case might finally be solved			1
it 's the latest in a long series of twists and turns as investigators try to unravel a mystery that has stymied them for 33 years : what happened to @entity6 ? commissioner @entity15 of the @entity2 says investigators will divulge more details later thursday			1
police : man in custody in @entity21 case in the meantime , the man 's statements raise hopes that investigators might learn -- at last -- of what happened to the six - year - old boy who disappeared on his way to the school bus stop 33 years ago			1
there have been a series of such leads over the years in the case , which changed the nation 's attitudes toward children 's safety and helped launch the missing children 's movement			1
one of those leads raised hopes last month of a break in the case -- but it did not pan out			1
first there was the drifter living in a drainage tunnel with pictures of boys who looked eerily similar to @entity50			0
a rash of false leads that took investigators as far afield as @entity54 chasing look - alikes			1
then , more recently , a cadaver dog picking up the scent of human remains in a basement near @entity50 's home , leading a team of investigators to tear it up			1
each time , the result has been the same : sometimes a few answers , often more questions , and rarely anything resembling the full truth for @entity50 's parents , @entity68 and @entity21			1
the family has endured years of crank calls and far - fetched theories on the home telephone number they never changed in hope @entity50 might some day try to call			1
" they exacted the biggest emotional cost , riding @entity68 and @entity21 on a steep vertical incline up the tracks , to plunge straight back down to hell every time , " journalist @entity75 writes in her definitive account of the case , " after @entity50 : the @entity83			1
" missing child case ' awakened @entity85 ' such dramatic ups and downs have long been part and parcel of the investigation into @entity50 's disappearance			1
in the days and weeks after he went missing in may , 1979 , police , the family and neighborhood volunteers worked tirelessly tracking down leads , according to @entity75			2
in the two weeks following @entity50 's disappearance , police put in more than 4,000 hours on the case , interviewing some 500 people , @entity75 writes in her book			1
police cruisers swarmed the neighborhood as volunteers plastered the area with 10,000 posters , according to @entity75 's account			2
then came the first letdown			0
the police officers who 'd camped in the @entity21 home , answering phones and dispatching detectives to follow up on possible leads , packed up and left , the emergency phase of the response over			2
in their place , they left a legal pad next to the phone and instructions to log each call			0
what had been a stream of calls slowed to a trickle , but kept coming , with their stories of boys matching @entity50 's description seen in places near and far			2
three years later , in 1982 , the roller - coaster would start its climb again with reports that a man , @entity132 , had swiped a boy 's book bag and tried to lure him and another boy into the drainage tunnel where he was living			1
police found photos of young boys among the man 's possessions , and took them to @entity50 's parents to see if their son was one of them			2
" almost three years into their ordeal , the half - formed scab covering their private life and private pain was being picked off yet again to ooze fresh blood , " @entity75 wrote in her book			2
" they greeted the news with the now familiar mix of trepidation tinged with the faint hope , one that could never be discounted , that new exposure could yield new information			0
" the case did n't pan out , at least initially , and @entity132 vanished			2
interest moved on to other reports , @entity75 wrote in her book : a photo in @entity54 , another in @entity165			0
a cab driver who said he picked up the boy the morning of his disappearance			2
like the other leads , nothing came of them			2
in 1988 , the cycle began turning again			0
investigators turned their attention back to @entity132 after locating him in a @entity176 prison -- where he was serving time on a molestation conviction			1
they brought @entity132 back to @entity178 for questioning , and got a bombshell , @entity75 writes			0
@entity132 acknowledged picking up a boy he believed was @entity50 and bringing him back to his apartment for sex , according to @entity75			2
but he said the boy declined his advances , so he took him to the subway and waved goodbye			2
three years later , in 1991 , after helping secure another conviction against @entity132 , federal authorities visited the @entity21 family again			0
they were there to deliver the news the family had long dreaded -- that investigators believed their son was dead and they believed @entity132 was responsible , @entity75 writes			2
" the words were not earth - shattering ; they were n't saying anything that twelve years into the case both parents did n't already know , " @entity75 writes in her book			1
" but now for the first time law enforcement was sitting across the table , telling them that the weight of evidence supported their worst fears			0
" at the same time , the federal authorities said they 'd come to the end of their journey , saying only @entity210 prosecutors could take the case to court			2
there have been more milestones since that day in 1991			0
in the summer of 2000 , @entity178 investigators examined evidence from the basement of the apartment building where @entity132 once lived			1
in 2001 , @entity219 had his son declared legally dead , and in 2004 , a judge found @entity132 liable for @entity50 's death in a wrongful death civil lawsuit			0
but none of those milestones brought them closer to what the family has long said it wants , barring the return of their son : a criminal conviction			0
in 2010 , manhattan district attorney @entity234 reopened the investigation after his election , something he had promised to do during his campaign			0
the promise that authorities were closer to mounting a criminal case seemed alluringly close last month , when investigators flooded the neighborhood and began dismantling the basement where handyman @entity245 once had a workshop			1
@entity50 knew the man and had sometimes helped him with odd jobs before he disappeared , @entity75 said in an interview on @entity0 at the time			0
authorities had looked at the basement workshop years ago , but never tore up the place as they were doing now , she noted			0
investigators recently renewed their interest in @entity245 , 75 , in part after interviewing him about his connection to the basement			1
during the interview , a source said he blurted out , " what if the body was moved ? " a few weeks ago , a cadaver dog picked up the scent of human remains			0
then investigators began to tear down drywall and cut through concrete in search of clues			1
" it was a huge number of resources being thrown into this case , " forensic scientist @entity272 told @entity0 last month			1
" it shows you that this case is still alive in the minds , ( of ) not only the public , but certainly , of law enforcement			0
" @entity282 , a retired police detective and cold - case investigator in @entity284 , @entity285 , who now heads the @entity286 , said last month that as he watched coverage of the case , the kinds of details that were emerging led him to believe investigators were confident they had finally come up with a solid line on hard physical evidence in the case			1
the big news came over the weekend , when it leaked out that investigators had recovered a chunk of concrete that appeared to be stained with blood			0
" i thought , ' man , this is going to be a slam dunk , they already know the answer to this story , ' " @entity299 said			0
then , suddenly , once again , nothing			0
the blood was n't blood , it turned out			0
no human remains had been found			0
@entity50 's family had to be told that the search had come up empty			1
through his attorney and daughter , @entity245 has denied any role in @entity50 's disappearance			0
cases as old as this one can be tough to crack , @entity299 said			0
" the longer it gets away , the more you really have to have hopes and prayers for technology to come into it , " he said			0
while investigators did n't get the answers they wanted -- again -- @entity299 says there 's still some good to take out of the effort			1
" it 's a success that 33 years later , somebody is still looking at it , " he said .			1

the 33 - year - old @entity6 case continues to stymie investigators
investigators recently concluded a search of a basement near where the boy disappeared
like other leads , it failed to definitively reveal what happened to @entity6
investigator says it 's a success that the case is still getting attention and resources
