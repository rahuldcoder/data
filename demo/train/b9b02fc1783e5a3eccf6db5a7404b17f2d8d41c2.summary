-- @entity2 co-founder @entity1 has been using @entity3 quite a bit lately , and he has some friendly advice for the company , from one social network to another			1
@entity1 thinks @entity3 should offer an ad - free subscription version for $ 10 a month			1
a premium version of @entity3 could appeal to people who do n't want to wade through the barrage of ads for a juice - cleanse delivery service or @entity17 fan fiction ( these are the actual ads i currently see on my @entity3 account )			1
" in general , the ads on @entity3 do n't seem particularly useful or engaging			2
however , ads on the service are universally tolerated because that 's what makes @entity3 free , and free is nice , " @entity1 said in a post on medium			1
the company could also throw in some special features for these @entity31 customers to sweeten the pot , according to @entity1 , though he does n't suggest anything specific			2
he does a bit of math to show how lucrative a paid tier could be			0
if just 10 % of the service 's 1 billion active users dropped $ 10 each month , the company would make $ 1 billion a month			1
for the first quarter of 2013 , @entity3 reported making just $ 2.85 per user from ads in the @entity43 and @entity44			1
that number is lower globally			0
advertising makes up 85 % of @entity3 's revenue			1
the rest comes from payments and other fees , which include social games and virtual goods , and amounts to about 65 cents per user for the quarter			0
the subscription model is common among tech companies offering content , such as music or tv shows on @entity59 , @entity60 and @entity61			0
but it has n't taken off with many social networks			0
@entity64 offers premium accounts that have beefed - up search , mail and other features starting at $ 20 a month			0
as an @entity70 's joke this year , @entity2 announced a premium service that , for the low cost of $ 5 a month , would include all letters in tweets , including vowels			1
the lowly free service would be rebranded @entity2 and include only consonants			2
@entity1 is n't joking with his new suggestion , though			0
in his post , he also said that @entity3 was too complicated			2
" the truth is , if i ca n't figure an application out in a minute , i usually move on to something else			0
too many settings and options frustrate and confuse me			0
i like making simple stuff because i enjoy simple stuff , " he said			0
he recently hired a few ex-facebookers for his new startup , and they guided him through optimizing all the settings for the least overwhelming experience			0
he 's now using @entity3 regularly to keep in touch with family , but like any regular @entity3 user , he still has gripes about how it works			2
this is n't the first time someone has suggested a paid , premium version of @entity3			1
but because he 's @entity1 and @entity2 is a hugely successful social network , people are paying attention -- unlike when your distant cousins or people you knew in high school complain in @entity3 's news feed .			1

@entity2 co-founder @entity1 suggests @entity3 launch a paid version without ads
he thinks people would pay $ 10 a month for the service
@entity1 also said he found @entity3 's settings to be too complicated
