if you have n't heard of them yet , you will soon			2
they are about to change something basic about @entity7 life : the sight of the mail carrier strolling up to the front door to drop off that day 's letters , magazines , bills and advertising fliers			1
door - to - door mail delivery appears to be a luxury that the @entity17 no longer can afford			1
it 's no secret that the @entity17 is in terrible financial trouble ; last year the agency lost $ 16 billion			2
no business can afford to go on that way without making dramatic changes			0
as @entity25 's @entity24 reported from @entity26 last week , the @entity17 has begun telling communities with new housing developments that mail carriers will not provide doorstep , or even curbside , delivery			1
instead , cluster boxes -- groupings of mailboxes at a centralized point in the community -- will be constructed			1
homeowners will be expected to leave their houses and go to the nearest cluster box to pick up their daily mail			1
and in @entity43 , rep. @entity41 , @entity42 , is proposing that door - to - door delivery be done away with not just in new developments , but at existing homes , too			1
he believes the @entity17 could save $ 4 billion a year this way			2
it 's hard to counter the argument that if something drastic is n't done , the @entity17 simply wo n't be able to operate much longer			1
with @entity7 relying more and more on e-mail and text messages , and with bills being routinely paid online , the @entity17 is n't bringing in enough revenue to justify the enormous costs of universal mail delivery			1
postmaster general @entity57 has been pushing for the elimination of saturday mail delivery , but congressional resistance made him put the plan on hold			1
even though @entity57 says that saturday delivery is no longer fiscally feasible , members of @entity43 are reluctant to anger their constituents -- both individuals and businesses -- by letting the plan go through			2
if the cluster boxes begin proliferating , though , and people are told that the mail carrier wo n't be appearing at their doors , you can expect widespread unhappiness and high - decibel frustration			1
it 's not that people do n't understand that the @entity17 is on the ropes			1
but to declare such a fundamental @entity7 tradition -- the arrival of the postal carrier at the front door -- past tense will not go unnoticed or uncontested			1
it 's hardly wild speculation to predict that people will not relish having to go out into the weather every time they want to retrieve their mail			1
some wo n't trust the security of the group mailboxes , no matter how many assurances they receive			2
they 'll be especially vexed on rainy or snowy days when they make the trip to the cluster boxes , only to find that the carrier has n't arrived yet			1
for those accustomed to door - to - door mail service , the act of picking up and sorting through the mail in front of other people may feel less private			1
opinion : no more saturday visits from @entity103 yet the really noteworthy thing is not what may be ending -- the noteworthy thing is what we have taken on faith for so long			0
if someone in government , today , were proposing to start the @entity17 from scratch , offering the amenities @entity7 are accustomed to , he 'd be laughed out of the room			0
" you 're saying that this service of yours would be expected to send uniformed workers to every house and business in @entity7 ? " " yes			0
" " how would the homeowners and business owners summon these couriers ? " " they would n't have to summon them -- the postal workers would be required to just automatically show up			2
" " how often ? " " every day but sunday			0
" " and then you say that they 'd carry the letter anywhere in the country ? door to door ? " " yes			0
" " so how much would it cost to take a letter from , say , @entity133 , @entity134 , to @entity135 , @entity134 ? " " forty - six cents			0
" " but how can you possibly do such a thing so cheaply ? " " some people will complain that it 's too expensive			0
" " all right -- but if it 's 46 cents to take a letter from one town in @entity134 to another town in @entity134 , how much would it cost to carry a letter from , say , @entity145 to @entity146 ? " " forty - six cents			2
" " what ? " " it would cost the same , no matter how great the distance			0
" " that makes no sense at all			0
what about the cost of fuel ? how can you charge the same amount for a letter to go five miles as you charge for it to go 3,000 miles ? " " because that 's what people will insist on			0
" it does sound impossible , does n't it ? it sounds like a plan so farfetched that it would never get off the ground			0
yet it has been an unquestioned part of the way we 've always lived			0
we no longer live that way			0
we expect our information to reach us instantly , on screens and phones and tablets , wherever we may be			0
but we expect to receive our mail the old way , too			0
it 's an unenviable position for the people who run the @entity17 to be in			1
see you at the cluster box			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity180 .			2

@entity180 : postal service may kill door - to - door service , switch to ' cluster boxes '
he says it 's an *unpopular* idea , but postal service must find ways to save money
he says if a *personalized* service like mail delivery were proposed today , it would n't *fly*
@entity180 : cluster boxes almost *inevitable* ; postal service is in an unenviable position
