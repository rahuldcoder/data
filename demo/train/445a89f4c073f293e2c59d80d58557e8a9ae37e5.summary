-- an @entity5 nomination , abs of steel and five leading roles in a 10 - month span typically denotes @entity7 golden boy			0
despite critical acclaim and a smoldering stare , @entity8 still manages to fly under the radar with most of the moviegoing masses			2
the actor has already received praise for his performance as the press secretary / spin doctor to gov. @entity18 ( @entity19 ) in " @entity20 , " which hits theaters friday			1
and his role as heartthrob @entity23 in 2004 's " @entity24 " will continue to haunt mediocre boyfriends everywhere			1
yet @entity8 's movies , many of which are smaller films , do n't always resonate at the box office			1
consider this our public apology to you , @entity8 , for not rewarding your hotness and all around good - guyness by making you a mega-star by now			1
we 've loved you since you started out as a mouseketeer on @entity38 's " the @entity37 , " though we assure you it was in an age - appropriate way			1
so if his rocking bod and humble nature -- he told @entity0 that women are disappointed when they realize he 's not @entity45 -- are n't enough to draw crowds , what is ? do n't ask @entity19 , @entity8 's " march " co-star and director			1
the @entity49 explored the likeness between the two leading men in september			0
despite being adored by fans and critics , @entity19 and his films do n't always garner commercial success either , as the article pointed out			2
remember " leatherheads , " " @entity57 " and " @entity58 " ? each of those clooney - starrers reportedly grossed between $ 31million and $ 35 million domestically , which is considered low these days for an a-lister			0
but like his " march " co-star , as @entity8 sets hearts afire while his movies fail to do the same , the media only becomes more infatuated with the 30 - year - old actor			1
first there was that amateur video of @entity8 breaking up a @entity72 street fight that surfaced in august			2
then those heartwarming photos of the actor carrying his tired pooch around hit the @entity75			0
and what about that time he told @entity79 paper @entity78 , via the @entity80 , " i 'll make movies until i make babies			0
" are you swooning yet ? " he is willing to show real vulnerability and ugliness , " movie buff @entity84 told @entity87 's @entity86			0
" there are moments in ' @entity24 ' when he is absolutely tragic , begging , weak			0
" it 's safe to say @entity8 has perfected the sexy , yet vulnerable persona			2
so much so that you 'd be hard - pressed to find someone who did n't fall just a little bit in love with him after seeing " @entity100			2
" speaking of that july release , with help from @entity103 and @entity104 , that flick brought in about $ 82 million domestically , making it @entity8 's highest - grossing film by more than $ 40 million since " @entity24			1
" frankly , " @entity100 " -- @entity8 's first mainstream film since the 2007 dud " fracture " -- featured the actor 's six - pack so prominently , it 's a wonder it did n't break box - office records			1
meanwhile , with a 93 out of 100 rating on @entity114 , " drive " was expected to find major box - office success upon its september release			0
however , the movie , which @entity8 said was crafted to resemble a violent " pretty in @entity119 , " has raked in $ 21 million domestically so far			0
it cost about $ 15 million to make			0
and december 's " @entity121 , " co-starring @entity122 , brought in $ 9.7 million domestically after costing about $ 5 million to produce			0
so will the numbers continue to catch up with the hype surrounding the release of " the @entity20 " this weekend ? at this point it may not even matter because @entity8 will continue to heat things up .			1

@entity8 started out as a mouseketeer on @entity38 's " the @entity37 "
@entity8 currently stars *alongside* @entity19 in " the @entity20 "
" @entity100 " has become his highest - grossing film since 2004 's " @entity24 "
