@entity0 -- @entity3 will begin enforcing an often - flouted evacuation order and keep people out of the 20 - km zone around the @entity8 nuclear power plant , a top official announced wednesday			1
about 78,000 people have homes in the evacuation zone , and many have been going back to retrieve belongings , and check on farms and businesses in recent weeks			2
animal rescue groups have gone in to get pets for owners who did n't expect to be gone for more than a month , and numerous journalists have ventured inside to document conditions			1
all that needs to stop " to guarantee the health and safety of the people , " chief cabinet secretary @entity21 told reporters wednesday			1
@entity21 , the government 's point man for the crisis , said @entity0 will work with local officials to make plans for closing the zone soon			1
he would not elaborate on how the closure would be carried out , but said that families would be allowed to enter the area to get things from their homes under proper protections			2
police are stationed at checkpoints leading into the area currently , but enforcement appears to vary from post to post or officer to officer			1
inside , cars and trucks swept away by the march 11 tsunami that triggered the @entity8 accident remain scattered across the untended fields			2
the line where the wave halted remains clearly visible , marked by the debris it left behind			2
abandoned houses stand open , with cattle and chickens left behind in their pens			0
a @entity1 crew entered the area for a short time wednesday and encountered a young farmer whose family lives just inside the 20 - km ( 12.5 - mile ) boundary			1
he said his father was considering returning home -- but as a young , unmarried man , he was considering quitting the farm his family has worked for three generations			0
" i 'm concerned about the impact on my health , " said the farmer , who declined to be named			0
" i wish i could trust the government , but i ca n't			1
" @entity3 authorities drew the 20 - km radius around the plant in the early days of the @entity8 disaster , now the worst nuclear accident since @entity79			0
the plant was struck by the march 11 tsunami that devastated northern @entity3 , knocking out its coolant systems and causing its three operating reactors to overheat			0
the accident resulted in the plant belching radioactive particles into the surrounding environment , leading to widespread concerns about crops , homes and livelihoods well beyond the immediate area			0
four days after the tsunami , @entity3 advised residents in a second belt , from 10km to 20 km away from the plant , to stay indoors if they remained in the area ; and on april 11 , it said residents of several other towns outside the zone to be ready to evacuate soon			0
the @entity3 government says it has no detailed readings of radiation levels inside the 20 - km zone			1
but journalists who have entered the areas have recorded radiation levels that typically range around a few thousandths of a millisieverts per hour			0
by comparison , a typical resident of an industrialized country receives about 3 millisieverts per year			0
one reporter who came within 2 km of the power plant in early april recorded a dose of about a tenth of a millisievert per hour -- high enough to increase the long - term risk of cancer with prolonged exposure , but a tiny fraction of the dose that would induce radiation sickness			0
currently , the evacuations are " very difficult " to enforce legally , government spokesman @entity122 told reporters tuesday			1
@entity21 said the government plans to designate the area an " alert zone " under @entity3 laws governing disaster response , a move he said would give authorities the power to crack down on people going into and out of the evacuated area			2
@entity21 ventured into the closed zone last week to meet with police and troops inside , and he said prime minister @entity138 is currently making plans to visit the @entity8 area to meet with some of those affected by the disaster			0
@entity143 and @entity1 's @entity144 contributed to this report .			1

a government official says the *crackdown* is needed for *public* safety
enforcement currently seems to vary from checkpoint to checkpoint
