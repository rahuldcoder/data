-- in 1917 , at age 24 , @entity1 went from being a musician to an instrument of war			1
the @entity7 , @entity8 , native is n't in any textbook			1
his name did n't go down in history like @entity12 or @entity13			1
but on @entity16 , and every day , retired @entity15 capt. @entity14 remembers his grandfather			1
there are no more surviving @entity20 veterans			1
they were largely remembered in the 1920s and 1930s , but after @entity23 , the forgetting began , said @entity24 , author and @entity26 professor			1
as time passes , their stories become lost , except for the families that preserve their words , photographs and memories			1
some relatives reach out to the @entity36 , which was created by @entity20 veterans , to share stories in its publication , @entity41			1
it was an avenue that allowed @entity14 to first share his grandfather 's story			1
" @entity36 constitution includes ' to preserve the memories and incidents of our associations in the great wars , ' " said @entity45 , editor of @entity41			1
" if we do n't share these stories , they 'll be gone			1
" through @entity14 and historians , a picture of his grandfather 's war experience emerges , and how the lessons from the first world war still reverberate a century after it began			1
a world on fire a love of music set the tone for @entity1 's life			1
along with his two sisters , @entity69 and @entity70 , @entity1 enjoyed performing in a musical trio			1
and had not @entity72 joined @entity20 , @entity14 suspects that his grandfather might have continued hosting community performances			1
but @entity1 saw the writing on the wall and registered			1
it would n't be an easy decision for him			2
tragedy had surrounded the @entity1 family early			2
his father , @entity81 , had died in 1895			2
his mother , @entity82 , had lost an infant son a year earlier			1
and now , the man of the house would leave his family			2
but protecting his family was also a big motivation for @entity1			2
" the war in some ways was really a war for family , " said @entity88 , a @entity89 associate professor and author			2
" the public culture around the war was draped in familial metaphors , a war to defend women and children from deprivation			2
" the doughboys , as @entity72 troops were called , became youthful , iconic symbols for the nation			2
because of exemptions from the draft , many of the men were sons , rather than fathers or husbands , @entity88 said			2
@entity1 left his community for the first time to attend training camp			1
camps were dangerous themselves , with the threat of disease such as the influenza epidemic , according to @entity24 , the @entity26 professor			2
after camp , shipping overseas was also hazardous , with waters infested with @entity123 u-boats keen to sink ships full of troops			0
@entity1 landed in the strange new setting of @entity127 in may 1918			0
he was surrounded by @entity129 , @entity130 and @entity131 troops , which would shift his view of the world			0
it was a hybrid army of less experienced @entity72 volunteers and conscripts melded with war - weary troops who had already endured three years of trench warfare			0
it was also a war of hybrid technology , @entity24 said			0
there were modern machine guns , poison gas , tanks , aircraft and submarines , but many artillery pieces were pulled into positions by horses , @entity24 said			0
communication was key , so armies relied on sounds			0
a series of counteroffenses had pushed troops back toward @entity123 , and trenches were abandoned , rendering telephone and telegraph wires useless			0
bugle calls were an old form of communication , but the archaic became necessary , @entity24 said			0
@entity1 's musical talent enabled him to become a bugler with the @entity167			1
removing his gas mask , he used bugle calls for signaling advance , attack , charge and retreat as well as for mustering the troops			0
@entity1 was a main target for enemy troops			0
knocking out communication in the heat of battle could further disrupt troops already shaken by the confusing fog of war			0
@entity1 's division saw heavy fighting and some of the worst battles at the end of the war			0
on august 1 , 1918 , @entity1 was wounded during the @entity186 by shrapnel in his arms , chest and legs			0
officials sent a notice to his family that @entity1 had been killed in action , and his grandmother raised a flag over their home , honoring his life and service			0
three days later , the @entity200 arrived to say that the message had been delivered in error , and that @entity1 was alive			0
but given the severity of his injuries , his family worried that he might not survive			0
@entity1 wrote home often , brushing off the injuries and letting everyone know that he was improving			0
read one of his letters ( @entity210 ) near the end of september , @entity1 rejoined the fighting in time for one of the most well - remembered battles of @entity20 -- the @entity215			1
the fighting broke through the @entity123 line and pushed back through five miles of territory			0
it was n't long afterward that an armistice was declared			0
@entity1 received the @entity221 , gold stripes that were worn on the cuff			0

as time passes , the stories of many @entity20 veterans have become lost
@entity14 shares the experience of his grandfather , a @entity20 bugler
the @entity36 and the @entity233 allow these stories to be shared
