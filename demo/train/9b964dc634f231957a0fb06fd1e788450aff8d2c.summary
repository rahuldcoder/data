-- maybe a phone 's not big enough for you and your spouse to cuddle up with on the sofa			2
or single folks need to travel light when they 're on the prowl			1
whatever the reasons , a new survey suggests that married couples are more likely to own a tablet , while smartphones are more popular with unhitched folks			1
the @entity14 , a digital marketing company , recently released its 2012 online @entity16 ( @entity17 ) , created with the help of market research firm @entity19			0
in it , 49 % of single respondents said they own a smartphone , compared with only 43 % of married people			1
meanwhile , 45 % of people who have said " i do " reported owning a tablet , compared with 36 % of singles			2
@entity14 vice president @entity27 said that differences in the ages of single and married respondents may have played a bigger role than specific habits			2
" for many of the findings , percentages zigzagged between age groups , rather than plotting a consistent bell curve -- indicating how factors such as generational differences , disposable income , and the influence of children on their parents impact results , " @entity27 said in a written statement			0
" married people are often older , have more disposable income and can more easily justify superfluous pieces of technology , such as tablets			1
at the same time , baby boomers are often more tech - literate than their slightly younger counterparts -- likely because their millennial children are pushing them to use new tools and devices			0
" the survey of 2,006 @entity55 adults was conducted online between august 14 and 16			1
it provides some other interesting glimpses into what could be called the mobile revolution that has taken over the computing world			0
for example , 59 % of smartphone owners said they had launched a web search on their mobile phones when they were sitting within arm 's reach of a desktop or laptop -- a number that jumps to 74 % for younger users , age 18 - 34			0
and 66 % of tablet owners said they 've quickly jumped onto their @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 or other gadget to get more information about products they see on tv .			0

survey : singles are more likely to own smartphones , couples to have tablets
