@entity0 -- @entity2 stole the slogan			0
but cruise ships can also lay claim : whatever happens on cruise ships , stays on cruise ships			1
only a tiny portion of alleged crimes on cruise ships is ever publicly disclosed , according to a report by the @entity9			1
of 959 crimes reported to the @entity11 since 2011 , only 31 were disclosed on a web site maintained by the @entity13			0
as a consequence , passengers have an incomplete picture of crime on board of ships			1
sen. @entity20 , a @entity22 @entity21 , disclosed the statistics on wednesday in advance of a hearing on safety and security on cruise ships			1
luxury cruise fails surprise health inspection " i 've been told time and again that cruise lines will change , that things will get better for passengers , " @entity20 said in a statement			0
" but according to our investigation , it does n't appear to me that passengers are substantially safer			0
" in 2007 , the @entity11 , @entity13 and the cruise lines agreed that the industry would voluntarily report to the @entity11 incidents involving serious violations of @entity45 law , including homicide , suspicious death , missing @entity45 nationals , kidnapping , assault with bodily injury , sexual assaults , firing or tampering with vessels , and theft greater than $ 10,000			2
three years later , @entity55 ordered the @entity13 to maintain a web - based statistical record of alleged crimes			0
but the site discloses only incidents no longer under investigation , giving the public an incomplete picture , @entity20 said			1

" if someone steals your property or assaults you on a cruise ship , you can not call 911 and have the police there in a few minutes			2
you can only call the ship 's security officers , who also happen to be employees of the cruise line , " he said in written remarks			2

for instance , two big cruise companies , @entity104 and @entity105 , reported a combined seven incidents in the quarter ending june 30			0
all were either assaults involving serious bodily injury or sexual assaults			0
