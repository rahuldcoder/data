@entity1 , @entity0 -- governments around the world continue to pump billions of dollars into financial markets , but there is still no telling whether the " injections of liquidity " will be enough to prevent " this sucker " -- to quote the @entity9 -- from going down			0
could 700 billion greenbacks be put to better use and kickstart a green revolution ? to many people one of the more fascinating aspects of the unfolding spectacle has been the bewildering amounts of money made available by governments to avert financial catastrophe			1
and no one knows yet whether it will all be worth it			0
the same could be said of climate change			1
no one really knows how bad it will get , but as the @entity28 concluded in 2006 doing nothing about it now is going to massively increase the costs of mitigation further down the line			2
but the amounts being talked about and spent on climate initiatives by governments is dwarfed by the bailout package			2
take , for example , a statement issued by the @entity40 at the end of september which revealed that 10 leading industrialized nations -- including the @entity43 , @entity44 and the @entity45 -- have pledged a total of $ 6.1 billion to help " @entity47 "			1
that 's around $ 675 million per nation			2
this sense of skewed priorities was recently put into perspective by rock star @entity53			0
speaking at the @entity56 , the @entity55 front man made a damning comparison			0
" it 's extraordinary to me that the @entity43 can find $ 700 billion to save @entity59 and the entire @entity60 ca n't find $ 25 billion dollars to save 25,000 children who die every day from preventable diseases , " he said			1
so what would happen if governments ignored the un-capitalist cries for mercy spilling out from @entity59 and put the money towards climate change instead ? what would $ 700 billion buy ? let us start at the margins of common sense			1
you could buy 100 billion energy saving light bulbs			2
at the other end of the scale , $ 700 billion would contribute a third of the cost towards a geo - engineering project which imagines deflecting the sun 's rays away from earth			1
astronomer @entity84 believes that the bill for his idea of a vast array of space mirrors would be around $ 2 trillion			0
a slightly more plausible idea might be to oversee a comprehensive insulation program for 700 million homes or perhaps fund domestic solar panels			0
a $ 10,000 photovoltaic solar array could be installed atop 70 million homes			0
much of the responsibility for our future energy needs rests on the fortunes of large - scale renewable solar and wind projects			0
why not roll out a comprehensive program now ? for example , the 40 megawatt @entity103 in @entity104 , @entity102 is due to be switched on in 2009 at a cost of $ 180 million			0
the @entity59 bailout would pay for nearly 3,900 such solar farms			0
if wind power was the only item on your shopping list then you could afford to build 3,700 farms similar to the 90 megawatt facility being built offshore at the @entity115 in the @entity45 , which would collectively generate an impressive 330 gigawatts			0
alternatively , nuclear energy -- now back from the dead and a big favorite with energy ministers worldwide -- would see 175 new plants at $ 4 billion each			1
but as @entity121 , head of @entity123 's @entity122 , points out : " there are two sides of the coin in tackling climate change			1
one is to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions , the other is adaptation , " he told @entity2			0
using figures from the @entity28 , the @entity132 and renewable energy industries @entity121 gave @entity2 his assessment of how @entity123 would spend the money			1
" if you put $ 30 billion a year towards protecting forests , then that could cut greenhouse gas emissions by one fifth , " he said			1
" another $ 20 billion per year is enough to spur an energy revolution and a massive uptake of green energy			1
and approximately another $ 10 billion per year would make sure we are using energy much more efficiently			1
" that 's about $ 60 billion right there for mitigating climate change			1
" for adaptation , @entity121 put the figure at around $ 50 billion per year for saving lives in developing countries and continents such as @entity154			1
" so that 's about $ 110 billion per year , " he said			1
" so if the @entity157 diverted money from the financial bailout we could have a really good head start on climate change in the next six years , if we applied the $ 700 billion in this way			1
" read about @entity123 's @entity163 here			2
an economist 's view earlier this year , @entity166 , @entity168 / @entity167 professor of economics at @entity169 in @entity170 participated in @entity173 's @entity172 exercise where global issues are rigorously debated and then ranked in terms of importance			0
@entity166 headed a team of three economists whose task it was to calculate a workable fiscal plan for global warming			0
" almost by coincidence , " @entity166 told @entity2 , " $ 700 billion is close to the discounted budget for the @entity172 exercise			1
$ 800 billion , actually			2
" " allocating $ 50 billion to research and development ( r&d ) on carbon friendly technology produced a discounted payback of nearly three times that amount			2
" adding reflections of aversion to risk , as well as optimally allocating effort over time , increased the payback to more than six times the investment			0
" download @entity166 's challenge paper here			0
but he cautions against spending $ 50 billion on @entity187 without economic incentives			2
" we would be wasting a lot of effort , " he said			0
" we should be thinking about risks and the degree to which you are reducing risks as you make these investments , " @entity166 said			0
" that 's a reasonable question about the bailout as well			0
$ 700 - 800 billion dollars would n't guarantee that you are going to avoid climate change			1
nor does that figure guarantee you are going to avoid significant financial trouble			0
but the benefits avoided are likely to be really quite substantial			0
" @entity166 says that the $ 800 billion figure he drew up in his @entity172 paper is n't necessarily the right number , but it would produce " an extraordinary gain relative to doing nothing			1
" he concludes that a mixture of adaptation and mitigation approaches coupled with greater research and development into greener technology would yield the best returns on the money allocated			2
the bailout bill passed by the @entity229 now stands at $ 810 billion -- strikingly similar to the budget @entity166 himself has been theorizing about			2
when the dust settles on the financial crisis his analysis may well provide politicians with a useful framework from which to start developing a meaningful large - scale climate change strategy			1
but climate change is going to require a lot more than just plain hard cash			1
" this is going to sound @entity242 centric , " @entity166 said			0
" but i think the world is looking for @entity43 leadership and if , in january , it picks up a leadership role -- accepting the notion that there is a void in leadership -- there will be a great deal of response			2
" how would you spend $ 700 billion to combat climate change ? let us know in the sound off box below .			1

how much would $ 700 billion help climate change mitigation and adaptation ?
@entity123 *spokesman* says $ 700 billion would " give us a good head start "
@entity43 economist says gains would be " extraordinary " compared to doing nothing
