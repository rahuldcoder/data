@entity0 hit his party 's " magic number " on tuesday , unofficially clinching the @entity2 presidential nomination in a race he entered as the front - runner and has had to himself for weeks			1
@entity0 led the pack when he announced his second run for the @entity9 last june , and he has watched his rivals for the nomination slowly trickle out as their own wins looked increasingly unlikely			1
the delegates to put him over the 1,144 necessary for the @entity2 nomination came in @entity15 , the lone state to vote this week			1
@entity0 entered the day 78 delegates away from the magic number , and on tuesday @entity18 projected he would win the state 's @entity2 presidential primary , where 152 of the state 's 155 delegates were at stake			1
on tuesday , @entity0 said he was humbled to have secured the requisite delegates to become the @entity2 nominee			1
" i am honored that @entity26 across the country have given their support to my candidacy and i am humbled to have won enough delegates to become the @entity2 's 2012 presidential nominee , " @entity0 wrote			1
" our party has come together with the goal of putting the failures of the last 3Â½ years behind us			0
i have no illusions about the difficulties of the task before us			0
but whatever challenges lie ahead , we will settle for nothing less than getting @entity26 back on the path to full employment and prosperity			0
on november 6 , i am confident that we will unite as a country and begin the hard work of fulfilling the @entity26 promise and restoring our country to greatness			0
" the chairman of the @entity50 , @entity49 , congratulated @entity0 on the milestone , saying @entity0 would " offer @entity26 the new direction we so desperately need			2
" @entity49 ' @entity54 counterpart , rep. @entity53 , was less enthusiastic			0
" tonight , after six years of trying and millions of dollars spent , and after a year of tepid support against one of the weakest fields in history , @entity0 has finally secured enough delegates to become the @entity2 's presidential nominee , " wrote @entity53 , the chairwoman of the @entity55			1
" @entity0 may have finally gained enough delegates to become the nominee , but what 's been truly remarkable about his path to the nomination is how much damage he 's left in his wake as he enters the general election			1
" @entity0 has been the presumptive nominee for weeks , but will not be the official party nominee until the @entity69 , set to be held the week of august 27 in @entity70 , @entity71			1
@entity0 launched his campaign on a warm day last june , telling his supporters gathered at a @entity75 farm that " @entity76 has failed @entity26			2
" opinion : how political ads can elect a president " from my first day in office my no. 1 job will be to see that @entity26 once again is @entity82 in job creation , " he said			0
the early primary battleground state would play an important role in his campaign			0
he initially invested more in @entity75 than the first - in - the - nation caucus state of @entity87 , which he eventually lost by a small margin to former sen. @entity89 of @entity90			0
@entity92 voters have long been familiar with @entity0 , even before his 2008 presidential bid			2
he served as governor of @entity95 between 2003 and 2007			0
@entity15 figured into this presidential race long before the first votes cast on tuesday			2
one of the three factors in @entity89 's april decision to end his presidential bid was a decision by @entity102 not to change their proportional delegate model to a winner - take - all system , which -- if he had stayed in the race and won the state -- could have given him a boost and held back @entity0 's delegate accumulation			1
opinion : @entity2 's problem with @entity112 - as big as @entity15 two of @entity0 's rivals in the once - crowded field are from @entity15			1
@entity15 gov. @entity116 exited the race two days before the mid-january primary in @entity119 after a disappointing fifth - place finish in @entity87 and his decision to stop campaigning in the second state to vote , @entity75			2
earlier this month , rep. @entity123 of @entity15 said he would no longer actively campaign for the @entity2 nomination , effectively ending his third run for the @entity126 with 122 delegates			1
when @entity89 , @entity123 and others were still in the race , talk of a contested convention swirled and it seemed to some a realistic possibility that @entity0 might not reach the magic number before the last state voted in june			2
former house speaker @entity136 vowed to push his bid onward to the convention unless @entity0 were to clinch the nomination earlier			2
he told reporters in late march that if @entity0 " does not have a majority [ of delegates ] , i think you 'll then have one of the most interesting , open conventions in @entity26 history			1
" he suspended his bid in early may , and on tuesday was to appear with @entity0 at a fundraiser in @entity147			2
the earliest contests weeded out rep. @entity149 of @entity150 , who won the @entity87 straw poll last summer but finished sixth in its january caucuses , and former @entity155 gov. @entity154 , who ended his bid before the @entity119 vote after falling short in @entity75			0
others dropped out before the voting began			0
businessman @entity160 's once - unlikely rise ended in december amid allegations of sexual misbehavior			0
former @entity150 gov. @entity163 dropped out months earlier , in august , after the high stakes @entity165 , @entity87 , straw poll			0
@entity0 , who becomes the first @entity168 presidential nominee of a major party , previously sought the @entity2 presidential nomination in 2008			1
he dropped out after @entity171 , which allocated 1,020 delegates from 21 states			0
the @entity15 primary in early march of that year gave sen. @entity175 of @entity176 the necessary delegates to seal up the @entity2 nomination			1
' other - ness ' : what @entity76 and @entity0 have in common on religion , race in his 2008 convention speech , @entity0 spoke about many of the same themes that are prominent in his campaign this cycle , including a call " to rein in government spending , lower taxes , take a weed wacker to excessive regulation and mandates ... pursue every source of energy security , from new efficiencies to renewables , from coal to @entity197 producing nuclear and for the immediate drilling for more oil off our shores			0
" president @entity76 faced no national competition for the @entity54 presidential nomination , and @entity18 projected he accumulated the 2,778 necessary delegates on april 3 .			0

with projected @entity15 win , @entity0 has necessary 1,144 delegates
" i am humbled to have won enough delegates , " @entity0 says
he will not be the official party nominee until the @entity69
