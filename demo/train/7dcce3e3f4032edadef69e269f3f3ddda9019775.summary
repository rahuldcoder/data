@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 's latest attempt to charge a fiery @entity5 cleric on terrorism charges was swiftly adjourned moments after it started in a south @entity0 court thursday			1
@entity9 could face the death penalty under fresh charges , which include planning and / or inciting a terrorist act and involvement in a paramilitary training camp discovered last february in @entity17 province			1
however , proceedings were postponed to monday after his lawyer argued that they were not given enough time to respond to the court summons			2
the 72 - year - old waved and smiled to hundreds of his supporters , who chanted " @entity25 is great			2
" @entity9 was first detained in august for suspected links to a militant training camp raided by authorities in @entity17 in early 2010			1
police said the suspect and his organization , the @entity30 or @entity31 , were involved in setting up the camp			1
the militants were preparing to launch attacks similar to the one in @entity38 2008 , and assassination attempts on @entity1 government officials , authorities have said			2
but the lawyers have called the case weak and a fabrication			0
this was going to be his third trial			0
in the first two , prosecutors tried to link the elderly cleric to the 2002 bombings in @entity50 and the 2003 hotel bomb attack in @entity0			0
the courts found him guilty of minor charges , and sentenced him to 25 months			1
he was released in june 2006			0
" this trial is very significant , because if the @entity1 government failed to provide a strong unshakable court evidence , they will use this as a weapon , an ammunition to gain more recruits , " said @entity55 , founder of @entity0 's @entity56 , which aims to reform radical inmates			0
" @entity66 is clearly a symbol , he gains certain level of celebrity among jihadist , he 's very strong , he has a strong charisma to build networks			0
" @entity66 is known for his fiery rhetoric			0
he was accused of being the spiritual leader of @entity1 's homegrown terror network , @entity75 , which inspired many of those involved in the bombings he has denied all the allegations and often blamed a @entity81 - led conspiracy to put him behind bars .			1
