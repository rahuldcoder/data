-- attorneys for 16 @entity3 soldiers on wednesday sued the largest @entity5 contractor in @entity6 , alleging the company knowingly exposed the soldiers to a cancer - causing toxic chemical			1
16 @entity11 have sued the @entity13 - based company @entity12 , known as @entity12			1
the lawsuit against @entity13 - based @entity12 , which seeks an unspecified amount , alleges that the soldiers were exposed to sodium dichromate , an inorganic compound containing a highly toxic form of chromium known as hexavalent chromium			1
the soldiers say that they , along with other @entity5 civilian contractors , were exposed to the chemical at the @entity26 water pumping plant in southern @entity6 shortly after the @entity5 invasion in 2003			1
@entity12 was tasked with getting the plant up and running using civilian contractors			1
the @entity11 were assigned to protect the civilian workers			2
the @entity11 and civilian contractors who worked there have described walking on and sitting near the bright orange powder that was widely dispersed throughout the grounds of the water plant			2
the chemical was believed to have been left behind by forces loyal to @entity38			2
some of the @entity11 already suffer from nasal tumors or respiratory system problems and other health problems , according to the lawsuit			1
one of the guardsmen may have died from the exposure , though the exact cause of his death earlier this year is still not clear			2
the odorless sodium dichromate was used at the plant as an anti-corrosive , the lawsuit says			0
the chemical contained nearly pure hexavalent chromium , the toxic substance that poisoned homeowners in @entity55 , @entity56 , and was made famous by activist @entity57 , according to the suit			2
for the @entity11 , @entity12 's " knowing acts and omissions " resulted in " months and months of unprotected , unknowing , direct exposure to one of the most potent carcinogens and mutagenic substances known to man , " the lawsuit alleges			1
a spokeswoman for @entity12 said the company was still reviewing the lawsuit , but denied responsibility for creating unsafe conditions at the plant			1
" we are not providing comment on the suit at this time			0
the company does intend to vigorously defend itself , " @entity12 spokeswoman @entity75 said			2
the guardsmen say the company knew about the dangers of exposure to the chemical as far back as 2003 , but did not act to protect the soldiers			1
" @entity12 managers knew full well long ago that this stuff was incredibly dangerous			1
but there was no information about it for years			0
and now these soldiers are facing some pretty serious health concerns			0
they 're going to be stuck with this the rest of their lives , " said @entity90			0
" the most frustrating thing is that these guys are finding out years later that they were exposed to something , " said @entity90 , one of the @entity13 attorneys representing the @entity11			0
@entity12 took issue with the allegation that the company knowingly exposed the soldiers or anyone else and did nothing to help			1
" @entity12 's commitment to the safety and security of all employees , the troops and those we serve is the company 's top priority , " the statement read			1
" @entity12 appropriately notified the @entity114 upon discovery of the existence of the substance on the site and the @entity114 concluded that @entity12 's efforts to remediate the situation were effective			1
further , the company in no way condones any action that would compromise the safety of those we serve or employ			0
" @entity127 , a father and grandfather , was an @entity3 sergeant at the water plant from may through september 2003 , when the worst exposures are believed to have occurred			0
he is one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit			0
" the worst part is that the military has only just recently advised us that the stuff we were exposed to was much worse than they thought while we were out there , " said @entity127			0
" it 's in our bodies , but we do n't know how bad it is			0
maybe within the next five years cancers could start showing up			0
you 've got a ticking time bomb in you -- and when 's it going to go off ? " the @entity5 military is not named as a defendant in the lawsuit			0
the toxic chemical made famous by @entity57 in @entity56 was a diluted form of hexavalent chromium that caused serious illnesses after being ingested by homeowners through their water			0
the chemical the @entity11 were exposed to in @entity6 was a nearly pure form of the chemical and could have been inhaled directly by anyone working at the plant			1
the @entity158 held hearings in august on emerging concerns about the exposure to the toxic chemicals after reports of civilian contractors and their exposure to the chemicals at the water plant			2
but officials of the @entity3 -- and most of the guardsmen who worked at the plant -- were not even aware of the possible dangers at the time of the hearing			2
some heard about for the first time during the televised hearings			0
only then did the @entity3 begin efforts to find the men , some of whom had already been back in the @entity5 for four years			0
an estimated 275 @entity5 soldiers may have been exposed to the chemical at the water plant , over a period of months through mid- to late - 2003 .			1

suit alleges @entity12 knew of *contamination* threat and did nothing to protect soldiers

@entity12 says it 's not to blame for creating unsafe conditions at plant
