@entity0 , @entity1 -- president @entity3 brought his midterm economic message -- that the economy is better but not better enough -- to a steel plant here friday , noting a strong jobs report and taking partial credit for the nation 's economic recovery			1
" this progress that we 've been making -- it 's been hard , " he said at the @entity13 plant in @entity0 , which provides a nearby @entity15 factory with parts			2
" it goes in fits and starts			0
it 's not always been perfectly smooth or as fast as we want , but it is real , and it is steady , and it is happening			0
and it 's making a difference in economies all across the country			0
" the @entity32 believes the nation 's economic recovery could help propel democrats to wins in november , though polls show @entity37 are still pessimistic about how far the nation has come since its recession - era depths			0
while jobs have returned -- as evidenced by a report friday showing the unemployment rate dropping to its lowest point since july 2008 -- many @entity37 are still struggling to find full - time work or positions that pay pre-recession wages			0
" there is a lot of good stuff happening in the economy right now , " @entity3 said friday			1
" but as we all know there there are still challenges			0
" that 's the message @entity3 and fellow @entity34 plan to sell to voters in the month left before midterm elections , though @entity3 himself has yet to campaign for a candidate running in november			1
even when he visits states with competitive races , @entity34 on the ballot have been reluctant to appear at official events with @entity3			1
friday 's event , in far southwestern @entity1 , was covered heavily by media outlets from nearby @entity65 , where sen. @entity66 , the @entity67 leader , is battling @entity69 @entity68			1
that race that 's become a referendum of @entity3 's own policies , which @entity73 has crusaded against on @entity74			2
the line likely to make the local newscasts : @entity3 's defense of new power plant rules that @entity73 and other @entity67 have lambasted as a " war of coal			1
" " the real war on coal is natural gas , " @entity3 said , noting cheaper alternatives to coal had led to problems for the industry			2
" obviously causes some hardship in communities that traditionally relied on coal , " he conceded , saying he was working to find ways to burn coal in ways that emit less pollution .			0
