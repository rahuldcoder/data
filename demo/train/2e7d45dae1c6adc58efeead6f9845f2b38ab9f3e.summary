@entity0 -- the 16 afghans killed in a shooting spree in early march were buried without autopsies , in accordance with the @entity7 tradition of a quick burial			1
any effort to do disinter the bodies and do an autopsy would probably be resisted by the @entity13 villagers			1
but that could present one of many challenges military prosecutors will have in making a case against the alleged shooter , @entity21 staff sergeant @entity20			1
last week , after meeting with @entity13 president @entity23 , secretary of defense @entity22 said that the " @entity13 people would see that the @entity25 is indeed going to not only prosecute this individual but ensure that he 's held accountable			1
" but making good on the secretary 's promise will not be easy			2
" i think the chances that he will walk are not bad , " said @entity29 , who spent 20 years in the @entity30 as a judge advocate general and military prosecutor			1
he now teaches the laws of war at @entity36			2
@entity37 is another former military prosecutor and the former president of the @entity39 who currently teaches at @entity41			1
he 's a little less pessimistic about the prosecution 's chances in the case but he said " of course , they 're going to have their hands full			1
" the lack of autopsies on the victims of the massacre in @entity13 's kandahar province is just one of many hurdles that the prosecution in this case will face once the charges become official			1
to prove someone caused a person 's death , prosecutors need a cause of death			1
as any fan of tv 's " @entity66 , " or countless other cop shows knows , that usually means an autopsy by a forensic pathologist			2
but @entity13 is a @entity72 country and @entity7 law dictates the dead be buried right away , usually within 24 hours			1
so no such post-mortem exams were possible			2
one @entity13 minister tried to help @entity25 investigators but hajji @entity78 , a member of @entity79 from @entity80 , told @entity1 that investigators " should take some samples of the dead bodies but ( many ) people gathered around this place and said , ' no this is not acceptable			1
' " this is not the first time @entity25 prosecutors have tried a murder case without an autopsy			1
" this is a big problem			0
prosecutors have faced that problem in several of the cases growing out of incidents like this in @entity101 and @entity13 , " said @entity92 who in his 20 years as a @entity30 , worked as defense counsel , prosecutor and a military trial judge			1
but even without autopsies , military prosecutors have been able to present evidence at previous trials establishing cause of death			1
" how it 's usually done is that ( with ) the cause of death , you have photographs hopefully of the bodies and of the wounds on each body			0
and although you do n't have the body , you present evidence depicting the wounds and the dead body and you present these to a prosecution witness ( and ) a doctor , and the doctor testifies these wounds would unequivocally would result in death , " @entity114 said			1
" it 's certainly not a preferred means , but that 's how it 's been done			0
" the next hurdle is getting witnesses to testify			0
" the court - martial itself has subpoena power , to require people to come to court , but that subpoena power does not extend beyond our national basis , " @entity92 said			0
" what we 've seen in the past is that the @entity25 government will make every effort to ask people and encourage them and provide them transportation to come to the @entity25 to testify			0
more often than not , they decline that			0
" if potential witnesses decline , attorneys involved in the court martial turn to @entity145 " the next best option is video teleconference testimony			0
" that would require a live closed - circuit tv feed be established between @entity13 and a court room in the @entity25			1
@entity152 's defense attorney has indicated he intends to raise the issue of @entity152 's mental state during the trial			0
" anybody that has seen what he 's seen and done what he 's done at the request of the military -- and i 'm not talking about these allegations -- i think would have ptsd , " attorney @entity164 , @entity152 ' attorney , told reporters earlier this week			1
@entity114 said that could help @entity169 's client avoid prison time			0
" defense counsel may argue that there is diminished capacity , despite that fact			0
if the jury is sympathetic and accepts that there was a lack of capacity , it 's conceivable that the jury would find him not guilty			2
" if @entity152 has mental problems , @entity114 said , it might lead to his being convicted on a less serious charge than being found not guilty across the board			0
" if the chances are not bad that he will walk , i think the chances are extremely good that he will not be convicted of the maximum charges			1
i think that if any he 'll be convicted of a lesser ( charge )			0
" between the difficulty with the evidence and the mental health issues , at least one of the attorneys suspects there might be a plea bargain before the case ever reaches trial			2
the hurdles " may incentivize the government to negotiate a plea , " @entity37 said			2
but if all this sounds like defense attorneys have an easy job ahead , they have hurdles , too			2
" the accused may have made incriminating statements , he may have made admissions when he was apprehended , " @entity114 said			0
defense secretary @entity22 told the media last week that @entity152 " told individuals what happened			0
" " that greatly narrows the options of the defense when your man admits he did the killing , " @entity114 said			0
but @entity152 ' attorney told reporters " there 's no confessions			0
" and there is the issue of video from @entity152 ' base that @entity1 's @entity231 reports shows him leaving the camp before the shooting and coming back afterward			2
" the film of him snooping through an orchard to avoid detection to get back into the case -- that , too , will militate against the defense case , " @entity114 said .			0

victims of the shooting in @entity13 were buried without autopsies
@entity7 tradition calls for a quick burial
that lack of pathology evidence is just one of the many hurdles prosecutors will face
