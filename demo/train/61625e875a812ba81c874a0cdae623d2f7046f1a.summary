editor 's note : @entity2 is senior lecturer in economics at @entity4			1
@entity5 says the government ca n't assure affordable , high - quality care for all @entity8			1
@entity9 , @entity10 ( @entity11 ) -- government spending on health care is growing at an alarming rate			1
if recent trends continue , the two main government programs , @entity16 and @entity17 , will increase from 6 percent of the nation 's @entity19 now to about 15 percent by 2040			2
this means that , without policy changes , the @entity8 faces enormous budget deficits , substantially higher taxes , or huge cuts in non-health spending			2
no one wants higher deficits or taxes , and there is no consensus about cutting other spending			2
the only way to avoid some combination of these outcomes , however , is to reduce the growth rate of what we spend on health			2
the question , of course , is how ? in a report this month , the @entity43 administration outlines its preferred approach			0
in a nutshell , the administration 's plan is to make health care delivery more efficient			1
indeed , the report suggests that improved efficiency can not only slow the growth of health expenditure but also fund government health insurance for the 46 million uninsured @entity8			1
increased efficiency in health care is indeed possible , but assuring " high quality , affordable care for every @entity8 , " as the administration seeks to do , is not			1
most health care is paid for by insurance			1
when people are insured they do not pay the full costs of the medical care they receive , so they demand the best and pay little attention to the expense			1
patients opt for surgery rather than medication or wait - and - see , even when the medical advantages are small			2
patients choose new , expensive medications rather than existing , cheaper generics in search of minor reductions in side effects			2
family members exhaust every life - saving intervention for an elderly relative , even when the prospects of significant life extension are minimal			0
doctors order excessive diagnostic tests , partially to avoid malpractice liability			0
if most people paid the full cost of their insurance , the incentives that insurance creates for excessive care would be modest			0
insurance companies would utilize co-pays , deductibles , coverage limitations , and other contractual features that discourage inefficient levels of care , and more generous policies would be more expensive , discouraging demand for such coverage			0
most people , however , do not pay the full cost of their health insurance			0
the poor and the elderly receive free or highly subsidized insurance via @entity16 or @entity17			0
much of the working - age population gets subsidized insurance because employer - paid health insurance premiums are not treated as taxable income			1
thus most insurance policies do not contain adequate incentives for patients and providers to balance costs and benefits in choosing the level of care			1
this absence of cost incentives is especially problematic -- paradoxically -- because of the technological progress that has occurred and will occur in medicine			0
these advances in health care are beneficial , but the new techniques are expensive			1
the implication is that patients and doctors constantly face the choice between high - cost , state - of - the - art care and moderate - cost , conventional care			1
if these decision makers face little financial penalty for choosing the best possible care , they will do so every time			0
thus subsidized - insurance combined with medical advancement means rapidly increasing expenditure			0
this suggests that to restrain government health spending , policy must reduce existing subsidies , not introduce new government insurance			1
inefficiencies in health care are a problem , but they persist because existing subsidies mean health care providers face limited incentives to control costs			1
a new government insurance program for the uninsured just makes things worse			0
in addition , this program will undoubtedly cost far more than initial estimates , as has occurred with @entity17 and @entity16			0
one way to reduce health insurance subsidies is to eliminate the tax - exemption for employer - paid health insurance premiums , while simultaneously lowering other taxes to hold revenue constant			0
this change in the structure of taxation would cause those now covered by employer plans to choose less generous packages and therefore make more efficient choices about health care			1
a second way to reduce subsidies is to gradually increase the age of eligibility for @entity17 from its current level of 65 , to 70 or more			0
this makes sense because of the improvements in life expectancy and health status of the elderly that have occurred over the past 40 years			0
a higher age of eligibility would reduce expenditure directly by shrinking the @entity17 beneficiary base , and indirectly by pushing more people to face the cost - control measures in private insurance plans			1
@entity191 back subsidies for health insurance is not pleasant medicine , but past improvements in health technology mean that even low - cost care is superior to the state - of - the - art a few decades ago			2
society must accept that we can not give everyone the best care all the time ; the attempt to do so will bankrupt the economy			0
as in other areas , societies must make tradeoffs about health , and that happens well only when governments subsidize less			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity5 .			2

@entity5 : government spending on health care is rising fast
he says government ca n't afford to provide top quality care for all
@entity2 : health *system* provides no incentive for patients or providers to control costs
he says taxing health benefits and raising *retirement* age would help
