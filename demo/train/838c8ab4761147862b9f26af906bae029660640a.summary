@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 , the former high - flying @entity1 politician whose dramatic fall from grace shook the ruling @entity5 , made a defiant court appearance thursday , disputing several of the accusations against him at his trial in eastern @entity1			1
once considered a contender for the top rungs of @entity1 's political hierarchy , @entity3 is now on trial on charges of bribery , embezzlement and abuse of power			1
a charismatic and divisive figure when he was in power , @entity3 has spent more than a year in detention			1
during that time , his name has regularly been featured in headlines , but he has been kept out of public view			0
on thursday , he returned to the spotlight , albeit one controlled by @entity1 authorities			2
timeline : @entity3 's fall from grace many observers had expected the high - profile court hearing in the eastern city of @entity0 to stick to a script of accusation , admission and conviction			1
but @entity3 , 64 , appeared to be unwilling thursday to let all the prosecution 's allegations against him go unchallenged			1
the thursday session has been adjourned and proceedings will resume at 8:30 a.m. local time friday , the @entity37 said			1
testimony disputed in posts about the proceedings on its official microblog account , the @entity0 court said that @entity3 contested the claim that he had taken bribes from @entity49 , a businessman in the northeastern industrial city of @entity51 , where @entity3 used to be mayor			1
@entity3 said that he had previously accepted the charge " unwillingly " when he was being investigated by a party disciplinary commission			2
" but at that time , i did n't know the details mentioned above , " he said , according to the court			0
after watching a video in which @entity49 detailed how he sent @entity3 money , @entity3 remarked , " i saw an ugly performance by a person who sold his soul , " the court said			1
the prosecutor showed the court written testimony from @entity3 's wife , @entity64 , who was convicted last year of murdering a @entity66 businessman			1
@entity64 's statement mentioned a safe the couple shared from which she took tens of thousands of dollars to cover expenses for her and their son , who was studying in @entity66 at the time			2
@entity3 reportedly described @entity64 's testimony as " ridiculous " and questioned its reliability , as it came after she received a suspended death sentence for her murder conviction			1
he then said that an accusation that another @entity51 business executive , @entity78 , gave him and his family a multimillion - dollar villa in the south of @entity82 is " totally false			2
" although @entity1 authorities had talked of a public trial for @entity3 , the former party boss of the sprawling southwestern metropolis of @entity89 , journalists from the international news media were n't allowed in the courtroom			2
reporters had to rely on the frequent updates from the court 's microblog account and official state - run news outlets , as well as a separate briefing by officials			2
as it dished out details through the day , the court 's account on the @entity102 - like @entity101 service quickly gained tens of thousands of followers			2
@entity1 leaves nothing to chance for @entity3 ' trial of the century ' high conviction rate it was n't immediately clear whether @entity3 's denial of part of the allegations was an unexpected development			1
the court 's publication of his comments suggested that authorities were comfortable with the situation			0
and his rejection of bribery allegations does n't mean the court will acquit him			0
the conviction rate for criminal trials and their appeals in @entity1 -- where the party controls police , prosecution and courts -- stood at 99.9 % in 2010 , a @entity123 report cited the @entity131 as saying			0
analysts have suggested that the court proceedings are more about settling @entity5 business than delivering justice			0
" it 's a political exercise , " @entity136 , a political science professor at the @entity137 , said before the trial started			0
" it is not a trial , per se , but a political settlement			0
" @entity3 's punishment will in part be retaliation for his audacity in challenging @entity146 , @entity147 and other top party leaders by pushing his own " @entity89 model " and engaging in public grandstanding , @entity136 said			1
first photos in more than a year authorities published photos thursday of @entity3 , who had n't been seen in public since he was stripped of his high - ranking party posts in april 2012			1
one image showed him standing at the dock in a white , long - sleeved shirt , flanked by two tall uniformed police officers			0
his hands , clasped in front of him , were not in handcuffs , and he appeared little changed compared with pictures taken before he disappeared from public view			0
the court published what it said was a dialogue between @entity3 and the chief judge in which the defendant was cited as saying he hoped the court " can hear my case reasonably and fairly , as well as following our country 's legal procedure			1
" the chief judge replied that the court " understands your concerns , and will use our legal authority fairly and in accordance to the law			0
" @entity3 's spectacular downfall -- complete with tales of murder , corruption and betrayal -- set off the @entity5 's biggest political crisis in decades			1
his wife is in prison			0
their son , living in the @entity192 , says he has n't spoken to his parents in a year and half			0
five members of @entity3 's family were in the public gallery at the trial thursday , state media reported without providing their names			1
they were joined by 105 other people , including 19 journalists			0
@entity3 trial : son @entity204 hopes father can ' answer his critics ' a career unravels @entity3 is a princeling , a term that refers to the children of revolutionary veterans who boast of political connections and influence			2
his late father , @entity213 , was a revolutionary contemporary of @entity215 and former leader @entity216			0
over the past three decades , @entity3 rose to power as a city mayor , provincial governor , minister of commerce and member of the @entity220 , the powerful policymaking body of the @entity5			2
a charismatic and urbane politician , @entity3 was credited with a spectacular , albeit brutal , crackdown on organized crime during his time in @entity89			2
but when his deputy , @entity227 , walked into the @entity192 @entity228 in the city of @entity230 in february of last year and told @entity192 diplomats that @entity3 's wife , @entity64 , was an accomplice in a murder case , a glittering political career began to unravel			1
@entity227 's move precipitated @entity3 's political demise			1
soon after news of the events began to emerge , @entity3 was removed from his party posts			2
a court found @entity64 guilty last year of murdering @entity66 businessman @entity241 in a @entity89 hotel room in 2011			0
a family employee , @entity243 , was also convicted in the killing and sentenced to nine years in prison			0
the following month , @entity227 was convicted of bending the law for selfish ends , defection , abuse of power and bribe - taking			0
he received a 15 - year prison sentence			0
the last chapter ? @entity3 's trial is seen as a potentially concluding chapter in the scandal			1
authorities have n't said how long it will last			0
but with only part of the charges reportedly addressed in the first day , it appears it could go on for longer than the two days some observers had predicted			0
under the bribery indictment , prosecutors accuse @entity3 of using his political posts to secure influence for others			2
they say that between 2000 and 2012 , @entity3 , @entity265 and their son , @entity204 , received about 22 million renminbi ( $ 3.6 million ) in bribes from @entity49 and @entity78 , the @entity51 businessmen			1
the embezzlement charge alleges that @entity3 and @entity64 transferred 5 million renminbi of public money from a construction project in @entity51 to a private account through a law firm in @entity276			1
and the abuse of power indictment relates to @entity3 's actions after he was informed about his wife 's involvement in the killing of @entity241 and @entity227 's attempted defection to the @entity192			1
@entity2 's @entity284 and @entity285 reported from @entity0			0
@entity288 and @entity289 in @entity276 contributed to this report .			0
