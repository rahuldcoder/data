over the last year , i have been working on a new documentary called " @entity2			0
" the title " @entity2 " may sound cavalier , but the content is not			0
i traveled around the world to interview medical leaders , experts , growers and patients			0
i spoke candidly to them , asking tough questions			0
what i found was stunning			0
long before i began this project , i had steadily reviewed the scientific literature on medical marijuana from the @entity16 and thought it was fairly unimpressive			1
reading these papers five years ago , it was hard to make a case for medicinal marijuana			1
i even wrote about this in a @entity24 article , back in 2009 , titled " why i would vote no on @entity2 " well , i am here to apologize			0
i apologize because i did n't look hard enough , until now			0
i did n't look far enough			0
i did n't review papers from smaller labs in other countries doing some remarkable research , and i was too dismissive of the loud chorus of legitimate patients whose symptoms improved on cannabis			1
instead , i lumped them with the high - visibility malingerers , just looking to get high			1
i mistakenly believed the @entity36 listed marijuana as a schedule 1 substance because of sound scientific proof			1
surely , they must have quality reasoning as to why marijuana is in the category of the most dangerous drugs that have " no accepted medicinal use and a high potential for abuse			1
" they did n't have the science to support that claim , and i now know that when it comes to marijuana neither of those things are true			1
it does n't have a high potential for abuse , and there are very legitimate medical applications			1
in fact , sometimes marijuana is the only thing that works			1
take the case of @entity63 , who i met in @entity64			0
she started having seizures soon after birth			0
by age 3 , she was having 300 a week , despite being on seven different medications			0
medical marijuana has calmed her brain , limiting her seizures to 2 or 3 per month			1
i have seen more patients like @entity74 first hand , spent time with them and come to the realization that it is irresponsible not to provide the best care we can as a medical community , care that could involve marijuana			1
we have been terribly and systematically misled for nearly 70 years in the @entity16 , and i apologize for my own role in that			1
i hope this article and upcoming documentary will help set the record straight			0
on august 14 , 1970 , the assistant secretary of health , dr. @entity87 wrote a letter recommending the plant , marijuana , be classified as a schedule 1 substance , and it has remained that way for nearly 45 years			1
my research started with a careful reading of that decades old letter			1
what i found was unsettling			0
@entity87 had carefully chosen his words : " since there is still a considerable void in our knowledge of the plant and effects of the active drug contained in it , our recommendation is that marijuana be retained within schedule 1 at least until the completion of certain studies now underway to resolve the issue			1
" not because of sound science , but because of its absence , marijuana was classified as a schedule 1 substance			1
again , the year was 1970			0
@entity87 mentions studies that are underway , but many were never completed			1
as my investigation continued , however , i realized @entity87 did in fact have important research already available to him , some of it from more than 25 years earlier			1
high risk of abuse in 1944 , @entity124 mayor @entity123 commissioned research to be performed by the @entity126			1
among their conclusions : they found marijuana did not lead to significant addiction in the medical sense of the word			1
they also did not find any evidence marijuana led to morphine , heroin or cocaine addiction			1
we now know that while estimates vary , marijuana leads to dependence in around 9 to 10 % of its adult users			1
by comparison , cocaine , a schedule 2 substance " with less abuse potential than schedule 1 drugs " hooks 20 % of those who use it			1
around 25 % of heroin users become addicted			0
the worst is tobacco , where the number is closer to 30 % of smokers , many of whom go on to die because of their addiction			0
there is clear evidence that in some people marijuana use can lead to withdrawal symptoms , including insomnia , anxiety and nausea			1
even considering this , it is hard to make a case that it has a high potential for abuse			1
the physical symptoms of marijuana addiction are nothing like those of the other drugs i 've mentioned			2
i have seen the withdrawal from alcohol , and it can be life threatening			0
i do want to mention a concern that i think about as a father			0
young , developing brains are likely more susceptible to harm from marijuana than adult brains			2
some recent studies suggest that regular use in teenage years leads to a permanent decrease in @entity188			1
other research hints at a possible heightened risk of developing psychosis			2
much in the same way i would n't let my own children drink alcohol , i would n't permit marijuana until they are adults			2
if they are adamant about trying marijuana , i will urge them to wait until they 're in their mid- 20s when their brains are fully developed			2
medical benefit while investigating , i realized something else quite important			0
medical marijuana is not new , and the medical community has been writing about it for a long time			2
there were in fact hundreds of journal articles , mostly documenting the benefits			0
most of those papers , however , were written between the years 1840 and 1930			0
the papers described the use of medical marijuana to treat " neuralgia , convulsive disorders , emaciation , " among other things			2
a search through the @entity220 this past year pulled up nearly 2,000 more recent papers			2
but the majority were research into the harm of marijuana , such as " bad trip due to anticholinergic effect of cannabis , " or " cannabis induced pancreatitits " and " marijuana use and risk of lung cancer			1
" in my quick running of the numbers , i calculated about 6 % of the current @entity16 marijuana studies investigate the benefits of medical marijuana			1
the rest are designed to investigate harm			0
that imbalance paints a highly distorted picture			0
the challenges of marijuana research to do studies on marijuana in the @entity16 today , you need two important things			1
first of all , you need marijuana			2
scientists can get research marijuana from a special farm in @entity257 , which is astonishingly located in the middle of the @entity257 campus , but it is challenging			1
when i visited this year , there was no marijuana being grown			2
the second thing you need is approval , and the scientists i interviewed kept reminding me how tedious that can be			2
while a cancer study may first be evaluated by the @entity271 , or a pain study may go through the @entity273 , there is one more approval required for marijuana : @entity276 , the @entity276			1
it is an organization that has a core mission of studying drug abuse , as opposed to benefit			2
stuck in the middle are the legitimate patients who depend on marijuana as a medicine , oftentimes as their only good option			2
keep in mind that up until 1943 , marijuana was part of the @entity16 drug pharmacopeia			2
one of the conditions for which it was prescribed was neuropathic pain			0
it is a miserable pain that 's tough to treat			0
my own patients have described it as " lancinating , burning and a barrage of pins and needles			0
" while marijuana has long been documented to be effective for this awful pain , the most common medications prescribed today come from the poppy plant , including morphine , oxycodone and dilaudid			2
most of these medications do n't work very well for this kind of pain , and tolerance is a real problem			0
most frightening to me is that someone dies in the @entity16 every 19 minutes from a prescription drug overdose , mostly accidental			0
it is a horrifying statistic			0
as much as i searched , i could not find a documented case of death from marijuana overdose			2
it is perhaps no surprise then that 76 % of physicians recently surveyed said they would approve the use of marijuana to help ease a woman 's pain from breast cancer			2
when marijuana became a schedule 1 substance , there was a request to fill a " void in our knowledge			1
" in the @entity16 , that has been challenging because of the infrastructure surrounding the study of an illegal substance , with a drug abuse organization at the heart of the approval process			1
and yet , despite the hurdles , we have made considerable progress that continues today			0
looking forward , i am especially intrigued by studies like those in @entity349 and @entity350 looking at the anti-cancer effects of marijuana and its components			1
i 'm intrigued by the neuro - protective study by @entity355 in @entity350 , and research in @entity350 and the @entity16 on whether the drug might help alleviate symptoms of @entity359			0
i promise to do my part to help , genuinely and honestly , fill the remaining void in our knowledge			0
citizens in 20 states and the @entity365 have now voted to approve marijuana for medical applications , and more states will be making that choice soon			0
as for dr. @entity87 , who wrote that letter in 1970 , he passed away 16 years ago			0
i wonder what he would think if he were alive today .			0

dr. @entity374 says we have been " systematically misled " on marijuana
@entity36 lists marijuana as a schedule 1 substance with " high potential for abuse "
most recent research on marijuana has been on its *negative* effects , @entity374 says
studies on marijuana require approval from @entity276
