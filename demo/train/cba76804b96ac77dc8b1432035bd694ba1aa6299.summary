-- a @entity3 lawmaker 's film critical of @entity4 has been posted on a @entity6 - based web site , though other web sites and hosts have refused to air the film and the @entity11 government has warned that it could spark protests and riots			1
@entity15 ' 15 - minute film , " @entity16 , " thursday was the top film posted on @entity17 in both @entity18 and @entity3			1
in @entity21 , its title means " strife " or " conflict " of the type that occurs within families or any other homogenous group			0
@entity27 , a member of the @entity3 parliament from the @entity30 , has been outspoken in his criticism of @entity4 and his support of immigration restrictions			1
he says @entity4 and the @entity34 are a long - term threat to the @entity3 and the world , and that his film is a " last warning			1
" " it 's not a provocation , but the harsh reality and a political conclusion , " @entity15 told reporters on thursday			2
@entity3 prime minister @entity44 rejected the film in a statement thursday , saying , " the film equates @entity4 with violence			1
the vast majority of @entity52 reject extremism and violence			0
in fact , the victims are often also @entity52			0
" the film opens with a controversial caricature of @entity4 's prophet , @entity59 -- one of those that prompted demonstrations in early 2006 after newspapers published the images -- followed by translated portions of the @entity34			1
the passages are followed by graphic images of the september 11 , 2001 , terror attacks against the @entity11 juxtaposed with audio from 911 calls made by the victims trapped inside the @entity71 in @entity72			1
the video includes disturbing images of other terror attacks ; bloodied victims ; beheadings of hostages ; executions of women in hijab , the traditional full - body attire ; and footage , with @entity18 subtitles , of @entity4 leaders preaching inflammatory sermons against @entity87 and @entity88			1
in one sequence , the film includes a series of newspaper headlines suggesting that @entity93 is under threat from @entity4 beliefs and practices hostile to democracy , and that some @entity52 want to create @entity4 states in @entity93			1
the film concludes with scrolling messages reading in part : " the government insists that you respect @entity4 , but @entity4 has no respect for you " and " in 1945 , @entity104 was defeated in @entity93			1
in 1989 , communism was defeated in @entity93			0
now the @entity4 ideology has to be defeated			2
" another film -- " about @entity16 , the @entity3 and @entity15 " from @entity108 -- is posted on @entity17 as a counterargument to " @entity16			1
" it questions the lawmaker 's motives and criticizes the @entity3 government for not reprimanding @entity15			1
@entity17 issued a statement thursday saying the site " has a strict stance on remaining unbiased and allowing freedom of speech as so far as the law and our rules allow			2
" on the site , @entity17 's posting rules include a ban on illegal media , such as child pornography , and videos glorifying death with " gory scenes with no explanation and / or set to music			2
" @entity17 officials referred questions about posting " @entity16 " to a statement issued monday that says , " there was no legal reason to refuse @entity15 the right to post his film			1
" however , the statement adds , " to many of us involved in @entity17 , some of the messages therein are personally offensive			0
that being said , our being offended is no reason to deny mr. @entity15 the right to have his film seen			1
" some in the @entity146 rejected the film as nothing more than dangerous @entity150 propaganda			0
" this film is a direct attempt to incite violence from @entity52 and help fan the flames of @entity160 , " @entity151 , a contributor to @entity154 - based @entity153 , told @entity0 on thursday			1
" any reasonable person can see this is meant to spit in the face of @entity52 and insult our religion			0
" however , he called on @entity146 leaders to react peacefully : " calmer heads should prevail			0
" @entity151 said he doubted the film would spark the same type of violence that followed the caricature of @entity59 , adding , " we in the global community learned a lot from the @entity176 cartoon controversy ... i do n't think it will be anything remotely like that			0
" @entity44 said the @entity3 government is aware of the concerns among @entity52 about the film			2
" we have recently spoken with many people at home and abroad to promote mutual understanding , " he said			0
" we will continue to follow this course			0
" @entity15 said he hopes that the film does not result in violence			2
but , " should this happen , which i do n't hope , then it 's the people who use violence or threats who are responsible			0
" this week , a web site promoting " fitna " was suspended by its host company after the firm received unspecified complaints about its content			0
" this site has been suspended while @entity205 is investigating whether the site 's content is in violation of the @entity209 , " the company said in a posting on the web site set up to promote the film			0
" @entity205 has received a number of complaints regarding this site that are under investigation			0
" the @entity11 @entity213 and the @entity214 also warned this month that the release of @entity15 ' film could spark protests and riots			2
last month , @entity220 's government blocked the popular video - sharing web site @entity222 because of a " highly blasphemous " and " anti-quranic " video featuring @entity15 , according to a government news release			2
the video was reportedly a trailer for his movie			0
