@entity0 -- an increase in the number of suicides among military personnel can be traced , in part , to a " stressed and tired force " made vulnerable by multiple deployments , a military leader said wednesday			1
long troop deployments in @entity11 , above , and @entity12 have been cited in the rise in military suicides			1
" we must find ways to relieve some of this stress , " said gen. @entity15 , vice chief of staff of the @entity16 , in testimony before the @entity18			1
" i think it is the cumulative effect of deployments from 12 to 15 months , " he said , adding that the longer deployments are scheduled to continue until june			1
he cited long deployments , lengthy separations from family and the perceived stigma associated with seeking help as factors contributing to the suicides			1
adm. @entity32 , vice chief of naval operations , said suicides are the third leading cause of death in the @entity36			1
" we must eliminate the perceived stigma , shame and dishonor of asking for help , " he said			1
gen. @entity41 , assistant commandant of the marine corps , said his branch of the service has incorporated education and training about suicide prevention " at all levels			1
" he said four of 55 mental health professionals deployed in the @entity50 were recently embedded with @entity51			2
he expressed optimism that that tactic would pay off , but he said he had no data to support his expectation			2
and gen. @entity56 , vice chief of staff of the @entity57 , said his branch , too , was taking steps " to ensure airmen are as mentally prepared for deployment and redeployment as they are physically and professionally			1
" sen. @entity63 , @entity65 - @entity64 , said the efforts have not sufficed			0
he noted that last year , for the first time , the suicide rate among military personnel has exceeded that of the civilian population			0
" what 's going on ? " he asked rhetorically			0
the panel members made clear that , whatever is going on , it is complex			0
@entity15 said the @entity16 tallied 133 confirmed suicides last year and is still investigating another seven possible ones			1
at least 70 percent of the suicides had " some kind of relationship problem , " he said			1
often , the situation was worsened by something else , such as a financial or legal problem , he said			1
and it was n't just the trauma of war that appears to heighten the risk			0
the suicides were about evenly divided among those who had returned from deployment , those who were still deployed -- some on a third or fourth tour -- and those who had never been deployed , @entity15 said			1
all of the military leaders said they had too few mental health professionals in their ranks			0
but @entity96 said professionals are not the only people who must be trained to intervene , noting that it is often the shipmate or the battle buddy who seeks assistance for someone in need			0
and @entity36 counselors are now asking family members for feedback that often proves more illuminating than what the sailors themselves are willing to impart , he said			1
" if i survey the family , i 'm going to get a different set of answers			1
" one reason some service personnel are reluctant to seek help from their chain of command is because they fear they will then be passed over for promotions , the panel members said			0
in some cases , they pay out of their own pockets to seek help privately , @entity121 said			0
and others call civilian hotlines , one of which reported getting three calls per day this year from active - duty military personnel			0
representatives of all of the branches of the military said they have seen recent increases in suicides			2
at the @entity136 , defense secretary @entity135 said he believes the 15 - month deployments " were a real strain " on many , but expressed optimism that beneficial changes are in the works			2
" all the services are are addressing this problem , but the @entity16 in particular , i think , is really going after it in a very aggressive way , " he said			2
but some suicides appear to defy all prevention efforts			2
maj. gen. @entity121 , deputy surgeon general of the army , cited the case of a 33 - year - old soldier who was living at home with his wife and three children			1
he suffered a traumatic brain injury more than two years ago and had been giving weekly motivational speeches to other soldiers in a clinic			0
for the past two years , the soldier also had been seeing a psychiatrist			0
the most recent visit occurred last friday			0
on monday , he saw his primary care doctor and his nurse case manager , and also had a life - skills appointment			0
" on tuesday , he apparently committed suicide , " @entity121 said			0
" this soldier was treated , compliant and supported in every way , and yet he 's dead today			0
" the suicide underscores that suicide is " a complex , very difficult problem that causes all of us to scratch our heads and wonder : how do we stop the next one ? " last year , at the @entity172 at @entity172 , two cadets and two members of the staff and faculty killed themselves , said @entity177			2
gen. @entity178 , commandant of the cadets			2
he cited stress from broken relationships and , in one case , a pre-existing mental health condition that academy officials had not known about at the time of admission			1
none of the four had been deployed to a combat zone			0
@entity178 called the spate of self - directed violence at the school " troubling and unacceptable " and said preventive measures there had been beefed up in recent months .			0
