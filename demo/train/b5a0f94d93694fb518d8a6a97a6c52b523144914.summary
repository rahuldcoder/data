-- every superhero movie is , on some level , an attempt to demonstrate that a godlike being with flabbergasting powers â € ” he flies ! he wields a megaton hammer ! â € ” also has an inner life			1
the success of the film hinges on how well it yokes together the external and the internal			0
" @entity13 : @entity20 , " a watchable but technologically over-scaled slab of @entity16 boilerplate , is far from a great superhero movie â € ” it 's more like the diagram for one			1
having done his time as a magical @entity29 hunk - out - of - water in " thor " ( 2011 ) and " @entity25 " ( 2012 ) , our hero ( @entity28 ) now finds himself back on @entity30			0
there , his father , @entity31 ( @entity31 , serving up his own special brand of highbrow scenery chewing ) , enlists him in a battle for the cosmos			0
muggles rejoice ! butterbeer is now being served at @entity39 the @entity40 are about to converge , which means that the @entity42 , led by the scowling @entity43 ( @entity44 ) , can now finally seize their moment to destroy @entity30			0
are your eyes already glazing over ? to succeed , the elves must gain control of the @entity50 ( pronounced '' ether '' ) , a supreme energy force in the form of what looks like a floating spill of red wine			0
in the film 's rather desperate attempt to personalize the plot , the @entity50 , which requires a host organism , has leaped inside the body of @entity62 ( @entity63 ) , the astrophysicist who fell for @entity13 and has been waiting two years for him to return			2
@entity63 plays her like a petulant schoolgirl , and that 's the movie 's notion of a joke : @entity62 just wants a boyfriend , while @entity13 , who loves her back , has weightier concerns			1
really , though , " @entity20 " should have given @entity62 a better reason for hanging around than the fact that she 's playing host body to a glob of extraterrestrial protoplasm			2
the first " thor " was directed by @entity77 with an elegant verve that made the special effects at once witty and spectacular			0
@entity81 , who directed this sequel , is a prestige veteran of the small screen ( " @entity85 , " " @entity86 , " " @entity87 " ) , but he brings little of that avid storytelling tightness to " @entity20			1
" which ' @entity90 ' personality are you ? see the characters ' @entity92 chart the new film sprawls , often with more spirit than reason			0
and though its images can be exciting ( the @entity101 - like palace of @entity30 , airships that glide like daggers ) , the battles have a videogame medieval dazzle that temporarily heightens the senses , then leaves you numb			0
@entity28 's @entity13 is once again a charismatically fast and bold stud - @entity108 warrior , but now that he 's mostly on his home planet ( with occasional forays down to @entity112 ) , he somehow seems less super			1
only when @entity113 is on screen , as @entity13 's dark - souled stepbrother , @entity115 , does any real drama take hold			1
@entity115 has been imprisoned for his treachery , but it turns out that @entity13 needs his help to defeat the @entity42			1
can he trust @entity115 not to betray him ? @entity113 , with pleading eyes and a mad - dog grin , plays @entity115 as a wounded sociopath who 's cackling at the world but seething on the inside			1
which makes you realize he 's just about the only character in the movie who has an inside			2
