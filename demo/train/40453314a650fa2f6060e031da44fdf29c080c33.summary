the coal ash poured out of a broken pipe into the @entity2 , turning water into dark muck			1
it took nearly a week to stem the spill , which sent millions of gallons of sludge from a retired power plant into a river that supplies drinking water to communities in @entity12 and neighboring @entity13			1
workers stopped the spill by plugging the broken pipe with concrete this weekend			1
now government scientists and the @entity19 ' largest electric utility face a daunting task : cleaning it up			0
tests since the spill have turned up higher levels of harmful chemicals such as arsenic in the river			2
but so far , officials say tap water is safe to drink			2
some environmental activists in the area say they are n't so sure			1
they fear the consequences for wildlife and say that the situation shows state regulators have n't done enough to crack down on @entity35			1
the utility has apologized for the spill and vowed to clean up any damage			0
" we 're committed to the @entity2 and the communities that it serves , " @entity39 , the company 's senior vice president of power generation operations , said in a statement saturday			1
" we are accountable for what has happened and have plenty of work ahead of us			0
" concerns over drinking water , wildlife @entity35 announced last week that it found the leak in a 48 - inch stormwater pipe at the retired @entity53 in @entity54 , @entity12 , on february 2			1
on saturday , six days later , the company said it had plugged the broken pipe that was causing the spill and was working with officials on developing a cleanup plan			1
coal ash , the material that remains after burning coal for electricity , contains metals such as arsenic , selenium and cadmium			0
tests of the river last week revealed levels of copper , aluminum , iron and arsenic above state standards for surface water , state environmental officials said			1
it 's unclear what that could mean for wildlife in the area , said @entity83 , a spokesman for the @entity84			2
" it 's certainly cause for concern for the long - term impacts of this coal ash spill on the health of the @entity2 , " he said			1
environmental advocates warn that the damage could be significant , potentially harming fish in the river and impacting the food chain			1
" you have a cleanup effort that is going to be difficult , " said @entity95 , who works for the @entity96 , a nonprofit advocacy group dedicated to protecting waterways in the area			2
" this shows even a small spill has an impact on the ecosystem			0
" some activists accuse authorities of deliberately playing down the danger of the situation and taking too long to notify the public			0
" this is another shameless attempt by ( environmental officials ) to downplay the risks facing the communities along the @entity2 downstream , " @entity110 of the @entity112 advocacy group said in a written statement to @entity114 on friday			1
" are we supposed to feel good that there are only four hazardous toxins , including a carcinogen , in our drinking water supply ? " samples taken by the @entity112 last week contained " extremely high levels of arsenic , chromium , iron , lead and other toxic metals , " the group said in a statement			1
state environmental officials said sunday that arsenic levels appeared to be decreasing , but recommended avoiding prolonged direct contact with the river in the area of the spill until further notice			1
unclear how long cleanup will take @entity83 said authorities have been open about what they 've found			0
" we 're not downplaying risks			0
we 're doing our objective analysis of what we 're seeing so far , and i think we are concerned , " he said			0
" the @entity2 is a gem , and people value it throughout the state for not only being a source of drinking water , but also for its aquatic life that it provides a home to and all the recreational uses			1
this is certainly something that concerns all of us			0
" @entity158 , executive director of the @entity159 , first learned about the spill from a mail carrier , who warned that the river 's water had turned black			2
the situation is heartbreaking , she said			0
" i stood on the bank a day or two after the spill , and i can say that i openly cried , " she said			0
" i was thinking , ' how can this ever heal ? how can this ever be cleaned up ? and what is this going to do to what i would consider one of the most beautiful parts of our country ? ' " now , she said , cleanup is key			0
" the longer it 's allowed to sit there ... t he sediment that has not gone down the river will be constantly churned up as it goes downstream , and the longer that we wait , obviously the more damage can occur , " she said			0
the @entity12 spill comes weeks after a chemical spill in @entity13 left 300,000 people unable to use their water supply for days			1
now , a federal grand jury is looking into that spill in what one official called a criminal investigation			0
in @entity12 , authorities will investigate the coal ash spill to determine what violations occurred , @entity83 said			2
state and federal agencies are working with @entity35 to figure out the next steps for cleanup , he said			1
at this point , it 's unclear how long that could take			0
authorities were still working to develop a cleanup plan sunday , @entity35 spokeswoman @entity206 said			1
" simultaneous efforts have been under way to not only plug the pipe and cap the system , which we successfully achieved last night , but also to test water quality			2
we 've been testing water quality since the leak occurred and will continue to do so , " she said			0
" water quality tests will inform our cleanup efforts and accelerate our planning for the best long - term solution at the site			2
" even before last week 's spill , coal ash contamination was a concern for @entity12 officials			2
the state filed lawsuits against @entity35 last year , asking the court to order the utility to deal with groundwater and wastewater violations at 14 sites where the byproducts of coal power plants are stored , according to a statement from gov. @entity238 's office			2
@entity239 said sunday that the utility is in the midst of plans to close the sites where it stores coal ash in @entity12			2
" @entity247 basin closure planning is already well under way for the ash basins located in @entity12 , including the one at @entity2 , " @entity239 said			1
" we look forward to moving ahead with that project			0
" governor has close ties with company before he ran for governor , @entity238 worked for @entity35 for nearly three decades , and critics have claimed he 's shied away from regulation during his time in public office due to his close ties with the utility			2
in a statement last week , @entity238 said his administration was the first in the state 's history to take legal action against the utility over the ponds			0
" we have been moving on this issue since the beginning of my term and will continue to do so , " he said			0
environmental advocates say the spill is a reminder of a troubling problem that 's widespread in the state : coal ash ponds storing large amounts of waste close to drinking water supplies			1
the spill raises questions , the @entity96 advocacy group said in an online post			0
key among them -- what chemicals are scientists testing for , was drinking water contaminated and will the utility change its coal ash disposal approach as a result ? according to figures released by @entity35 , last week 's spill appears to be similar to , but smaller than , a 2008 coal ash spill at a power plant in @entity295 , @entity296 , which sent 1.1 billion gallons of sludge into the adjacent @entity298			1
state authorities slapped the @entity302 with $ 11.5 million fines after that spill , which authorities said violated state clean - water and solid waste disposal laws			0
in statements announcing the @entity12 spill last week , @entity35 said up to 82,000 tons of ash had been released and up to 27 million gallons of basin water had flooded into the river			1
that amount of ash , the company said , would fill up to 32 @entity317 - size swimming pools .			0
