@entity0 , @entity1 -- it 's a regular monday morning in one of @entity0 's city slums and 14 - year - old @entity6 is getting ready to face the day ahead			1
just as she 's about to step out , a frantic voice calls out her name -- it 's a friend from her local neighborhood in @entity12			2
@entity6 's face turns pale as her friend whispers urgently into her ear			1
eventually she reaches for the nearest telephone			0
her call , which turns out to be to the police , results in a raid on a wedding ceremony in the neighborhood shortly after			0
but this is no ordinary union because the bride is a child			2
fortunately she 's rescued -- a rare success story on this occasion			2
according to @entity27 , an estimated 50,000 children live on the streets of @entity1 's capital and do what they can to survive , from selling their wares at busy roadsides , begging , rag - picking and even performing street acrobatics			1
and these children , often as young as seven or eight , face constant danger -- more than 50 % have suffered verbal , physical or sexual abuse , sometimes at the hands of policemen , according to the children 's rights group			1
dealing with the darker aspects of @entity1 society is far from easy for these kids -- especially in the city 's heaving slums			1
pen power so what gives one teenage girl the courage to do so ? according to @entity6 , it 's the power of the pen			1
she 's not just any other teen from @entity0 's slums ; she 's a journalist			1
to be precise , she 's a crime reporter who documents life on the streets for the neighborhood children through her articles in @entity58 , a free newspaper published every quarter in @entity60			1
to her friends and family , @entity6 is no less than a star			1
anybody and everybody who faces a problem in the area comes to her			0
it 's a far cry from the way things were four years earlier when she worked as a domestic helper			2
too poor to attend school , she was forced to scrape a living with other family members : she 'd wake well before dawn , feed her younger siblings and then join her mother to clean other people 's homes until late at night			1
it was a tough life			2
through a friend , she heard about a group of people from a similar background who were organizing a newspaper -- but not just any newspaper			2
it told stories -- their stories -- of the harsh existence on @entity0 's streets			1
despite reservations from her mother , @entity95 saw this as a chance to break out and make a difference , to tell her story in her way			0
" now i can study and contribute to the newspaper , " she says			2
" i felt like a superstar when my photo first appeared in the newspaper with my name on it			2
i 've never looked back			0
" eventually she hopes to become a teacher and educate underprivileged children like her			0
@entity109 , also 14 , has a similar story			0
he used to wander aimlessly on the streets of the city with his friends before he too discovered the power of the pen			1
he was only nine when he heard about the newspaper			0
despite opposition and derision from friends and family , @entity109 decided to give it a chance			0
" when i joined @entity82 , my friends used to make fun of me			1
but now when they read my articles and see me grow in my life -- they wish they too had done so , " he said			0
like @entity6 , he puts the spotlight on issues that affect daily life for some of @entity1 's most impoverished and forgotten people -- from abuse to poverty and healthcare			1
anniversary edition founded in 2003 , @entity82 is an initiative of @entity140 , a federation of street and working children in northern @entity1 , in association with @entity0 - based @entity144 , @entity145 ( @entity146 )			1
it aims to give a voice to the most underprivileged and marginalized sections of @entity1 's society			1
here , young people can write about the afflictions and suffering they witness on a daily basis in a sympathetic environment			0
@entity156 , who also spent years battling to survive on the unforgiving streets , is one of the founders			0
he has big plans for the paper			0
" with the growing popularity of our newspaper , we want to increase its circulation and turn it into an eight - page edition from the existing four pages , " he said			0
they recently published a 10th anniversary edition in color for the first time			0
every contributor to the paper has a compelling story			0
eleven years ago , @entity156 was himself a school drop - out forced to move to @entity0 to make a living on the streets			1
he sold magazines on busy traffic intersections , earning barely us $ 2 - 3 a day			0
it was at one of these intersections that one of @entity146 's activists noticed the skinny youngster hiding nervously behind another teenager selling magazines and offered him shelter and the chance to make a life			1
@entity156 feared it could be a trap laid by human traffickers , but eventually decided to take a leap of faith and accompany this stranger			0
pride and self - confidence the newspaper idea offered @entity156 a new lease of life -- his daily existence was given direction , while his pride and self - confidence was restored			2
he is now pursuing a masters degree in @entity204 and plans to do a phd in the future			0
@entity207 , director of @entity146 , feels the newspaper experience not only gives the children a chance to talk about some of the harrowing things they 've seen , it is also empowering			2
" children associated with @entity82 are much more aware about their rights than the average school - going child , " he said			1
" they 're also shown how to deal with some of the emergencies that may come their way			0
" the kids also benefit from @entity146 - sponsored services , from access to support groups and workshops that help them deal with the issues they 've experienced , to health clinics , drug rehabilitation and counseling			0
back at the newspaper , the sight of @entity6 and her colleagues completely absorbed in their work is inspiring , an example of how even the most forgotten members of @entity1 society can blossom if given the chance .			1
