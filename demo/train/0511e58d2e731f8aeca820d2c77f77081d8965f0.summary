-- @entity2 's fiancé will not let her live down the fact that she chose a hotel for their weekend getaway from @entity7 , @entity8 , to @entity9 based on the teenage drama " @entity11			1
" @entity12 , a 26 - year - old public relations executive , watches the @entity14 show regularly			1
like many viewers this past season , she took notice when the show 's resident bad boy , @entity19 , opted to invest in some @entity9 real estate , the very real @entity22 on @entity24 's @entity23			1
" we walked into the lobby and my fiancé was like , ' oh , now i know why you wanted to stay here , even though this hotel is in a horrible neighborhood , ' " @entity12 recalled			2
it is women in their 20s and early 30s , like @entity12 , who have built a fan base for " @entity11 " and who are now driving traffic to the hotel across the street from @entity40			1
while hotels in @entity9 have been suffering over the past six months because of the nationwide recession and an increase in the supply of hotel rooms in the city , @entity22 has seen a 5 to 10 percent increase in bookings and a 50 percent increase in web site traffic since september			1
the marriage between property and television show began last summer when the production company called @entity55 , the president of hotels for @entity57 , which owns the @entity22 , and said it was looking for a hotel for location filming and also to include as a quasi-character on the show			1
" they were looking at three major competitors of ours at the time , " @entity55 said			0
" they finally picked us and i thought it was a great match for the hotel because we already catered to a young , affluent crowd in @entity9 with our rooftop lounge			1
" the show started filming quietly in the hotel 's rooms and lobby over the summer			1
the hotel made its tv debut at the start of the fall season when @entity19 began living and working out of the hotel			2
its bright red sign is featured prominently on the show			2
" my phone never stopped ringing from folks in the industry asking ' really ? ' " @entity55 said			0
" but i thought it was a great idea			0
i watched as a woman around 17 years old came to stay at the hotel with her mother			2
she did n't realize that the show would be filming and she nearly hyperventilated right there in the lobby			2
" it is girls like that and women like @entity12 who are driving traffic to the hotel these days			0
that is an invaluable asset as tourist traffic is up and business travel is down			0
" i think that teenagers can dictate where their parents stay over vacation and we saw a lot of that over the @entity109 holiday and into the bookings for @entity111 and @entity112 's , " @entity55 said			2
@entity113 manages the front desk and concierge service for the @entity116 and said there is no shortage of guest questions about the show during the room booking process			0
" the standard questions we get are about how often the cast shoots and when they will be back			0
a lot of people call just wanting to know if they really shoot here in the hotel or whether they just use the name , and i have to tell them that yes , they really do shoot on location here , " @entity125 said			0
on site , most of the questions @entity125 and her staff are asked do n't come from starstruck teenagers			0
they come from women @entity12 's age			0
" the questions here come from girls in their 20s and 30s			0
they want to know if @entity19 is really as cute as he is on the show and if the girls are actually skinny in person , " @entity125 said			0
when the show 's stars , @entity154 , @entity155 and @entity156 , are at the hotel filming , it is n't unusual for crowds of around 400 people to gather outside the hotel 's entrance on @entity162			1
the @entity116 's boom comes amid an overall decrease in occupancy for hotel rooms throughout the rest of @entity9			1
@entity168 , a senior vice president with @entity169 , a consulting hotel advisory firm , reviews hotel numbers every day			0
he noticed an uptick in the @entity116 's numbers recently but had not thought to attribute it to the hotel 's guest appearance in a television show			1
@entity168 said the rest of @entity9 's hotels are just starting to put the dark days behind them			1
compared to the @entity116 's increased sales , occupancy for the city as a whole has been at 81 percent , down 5 points from 86 percent last year			1
additionally , room rates have been down , decreasing by around $ 70 last year			0
the change , @entity168 said , comes from the replacement of business travelers to the city with the kind of tourists who are flocking to the @entity116			0
" you can compare it to what ' @entity197 ' did for the shoes [ of ] @entity200 , " said branding expert @entity192 of the @entity194			0
" it increases the awareness of the hotel to a national audience and people who are loyal viewers of the show will want to experience in their lives what they see the characters experiencing			2
plus people who are new to @entity9 will already feel like they know the hotel and that is comforting for out - of - town travelers			1
" the hotel 's staff has been enjoying capitalizing on its newfound fame			2
they hired cocktail consultant @entity217 to concoct a menu of " @entity11 " - themed cocktails for the property 's rooftop bar and lounge , including the " i 'm @entity19 , " a mix of @entity225 and apple cider that the menu promises will start out sweet and turn sour , much like the character played by @entity156 .			1

@entity9 's @entity22 is regularly featured on the @entity14 's " @entity11 "
the hotel has seen a 5 to 10 percent increase in bookings since september
the show 's stars , @entity154 and @entity156 , draw crowds when filming there
