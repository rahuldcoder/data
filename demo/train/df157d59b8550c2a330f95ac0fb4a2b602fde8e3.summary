human activity has caused at least half of climate change in the last half - century , hundreds of scientists say			1
they are 95 % certain of this , the surest they 've ever been , says a @entity8 report published friday			2
that activity ? driving cars , running power plants on coal and oil , torching swathes of forestland and debris ; anything involving burning carbon - based fuels and emitting greenhouse gases			0
we are seeing the consequences already in extreme weather patterns , particularly drought and flood , and they will probably get worse this century , the report said			1
" it should serve as yet another wake - up call our activities today have a profound impact on society , not only for us , but for many generations to come , " @entity26 , head of the @entity28 , said at a news conference in @entity30 , @entity31			0
@entity38 secretary of state @entity37 echoed his words in an official statement			1
" those who deny the science or choose excuses over action are playing with fire , " he said			2
" once again , the science grows clearer , the case grows more compelling , and the costs of inaction grow beyond anything that anyone with conscience or common sense should be willing to even contemplate			0
" beneath @entity54 's ice , a grand canyon the assessment report from the @entity57 is the benchmark study on global warming published every few years			2
nearly 1,000 researchers from around the world work on the document , which then undergoes review by about as many scientists			0
the panel released a summary report friday and plans to post the full version , roughly 2,500 pages , online on monday			2
this year 's report further strengthens the suspicions that scientists already have			2
in 2007 , climate researchers were already 90 % sure that people were behind a seemingly small rise in global average temperature of about half a degree @entity78 ( 1 @entity79 ) that has already notched up extreme weather events such as heat waves , droughts and flooding			2
while 90 % constitutes a " very likely " degree of certainty , friday 's report stating scientists are now 95 % sure indicates an " extremely likely " degree of certainty , which is considered the gold standard when discussing probability			1
the effects humans are already causing are expected to increase for a century or more , the report reads			1
weather catastrophes , previously called storms of the century , are on their way to striking every 20 years or even more frequently			0
@entity97 : why @entity98 forced cities to take lead on climate change this means , unfortunately , that we could see more @entity105 tornadoes like the one that ground up @entity108 , @entity109 ; stronger and more floods like those that inundated @entity112 towns ; another @entity98 or @entity113 or two in our lifetimes ; more crops wiped out by drought ; and more forestland consumed by roaring wildfires			1
the @entity121 ice cap could melt nearly completely in summer , and sea levels could continue to rise			0
in the @entity123 , the ice cap could continue to increase slightly			0
and if greenhouse gas emissions continue to climb as they have , the resulting temperature rise and its deadly effects would get even worse , the report says			0
hundreds of experts weigh in the 2013 assessment report from the @entity57 brings together the latest research from top scientists in the field			0
it contains a " summary for policymakers " aimed at guiding politicians and lawmakers worldwide on decisions regarding the environment over the next several years			2
the document released friday explains the physical science behind climate change			1
the @entity8 panel releases a report every five or six years			0
friday 's report is the culmination of work by more than 250 authors from 39 countries and was subject to an extensive review process involving more than 1,000 experts			0
more than 850 expert authors from 85 countries contributed research for the full report , which will be released in three stages through april			0
the first , on the physical science behind climate change , accompanies the summary for policymakers			1
the second , expected in march , will cover " impacts and vulnerabilities " of climate change ; the third , on mitigation efforts , is set to go out in april			1
climate change may increase violence , study shows critics of the report despite the breadth of the scientific expertise involved and the extensive review and approval process , the assessment reports spark quite a few criticisms , from both climate change believers and skeptics			1
skeptics say the panel exists only to produce further evidence supporting the idea of man - made climate change while ignoring opposing research			1
but climate change activists , and many climate scientists , say the panel 's consensus - seeking policy produces conclusions and estimates that are too conservative			1
another often - cited critique of the report is that , due to its size and lengthy approval process , it is already outdated by the time it is released			0
several important studies already have been published in the past year in the constantly evolving science of climate change that will not be included in this assessment			1
despite the critics , this week 's document will serve as a major measuring stick for the current state of the world 's climate and what type of change is in store			1
the summary for policymakers will be available friday at @entity210			0
climate sticker shock : @entity121 thaw could cost $ 60 trillion			0

climate change deniers *beware* , says secretary of state @entity37
there is even more certainty that humans are playing a role
the report lays out *projections* for climate change through the end of the century
the first section of the report is aimed at assisting policymakers
