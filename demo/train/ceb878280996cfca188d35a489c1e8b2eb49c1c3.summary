-- something strange happened monday on the @entity2			0
@entity3 -- the once - underdog social network founded by a kid in a hoodie in a dorm room -- may have officially cemented its status as a titan of the tech establishment it once challenged			1
what changed ? @entity3 -- no longer a feisty startup but a 3,000 - person , soon - to - be - public corporation with $ 3.9 billion in cash and an $ 85 billion to $ 100 billion valuation -- spent $ 1 billion to gobble up a much - smaller competitor , the photo - sharing app @entity20			1
when it did so , it stirred up a caldron of ill will that the " people of the @entity2 " have been harboring toward @entity24 's once - hip company			2
some @entity20 users said they were downloading all of their photos and then deleting them from the app just so @entity3 could n't get its hands on them			1
pundits were n't kind to @entity3 , either			1
@entity30 of the @entity31 , writing about the @entity20 purchase , noted that the company is looking more and more like " @entity34 , " a gentler variation on @entity37 's all - seeing @entity36			1
data indicate others share that view , too			0
a new poll , conducted before the @entity20 news , found that 28 % of @entity43 have an unfavorable view of @entity3 -- twice as many as disapprove of @entity46 and nearly three times as many as @entity48			1
this backlash highlights a new reality : as a technological juggernaut , @entity3 is more @entity52 than @entity53			2
to use a musical analogy employed on @entity55 , it 's the @entity56 to @entity20 's @entity57			1
@entity3 and @entity20 's images could n't be more different , so it 's tempting to say that this @entity61 - buys - @entity30 event is a turning point for @entity3			1
but people have been writing about @entity3 losing its mojo for years now			2
in 2009 , @entity65 ran this headline : " is @entity3 getting uncool for 18 - 24s ? " a year later , mainstream news websites noted the phenomenon of parents and grandparents joining @entity3 , scaring off younger people			1
" it 's official , @entity3 is becoming uncool , " @entity73 declared			1
it 's hard to pinpoint the moment when @entity3 's image problem started			1
maybe it was when users realized how much data @entity3 was collecting about them			1
maybe it was when ceo @entity24 started to seem less like that geeky , counterculture college kid and more like a run - of - the - mill billionaire			0
but it is possible to take a look at the conversation and tease out a few factors that seem to have led to @entity3 's current status as an inescapable , perhaps orwellian , internet giant			1
nothing leads to public skepticism quite like a few billion dollars in pocket change			0
compare that kind of situation at @entity3 to @entity20 , which as @entity97 notes , had n't monetized its product			1
it did n't support advertisements and apparently did n't sell its users ' data			2
@entity3 , on the other hand , is accused of profiting wildly on the backs of the 850 million people who share personal details about their lives on the social network			2
for more on that , see the @entity111 's recent feature " selling you on @entity3 , " which analyzes the info that @entity3 apps collect			1
view some of the photos , comments from readers second : size			0
as companies get bigger , people tend to question their motives			0
@entity48 is a good example of this view			0
the @entity122 company once was the darling of the @entity2 -- the search engine that did n't have ads on its homepage and declared its company ethos was " @entity128			0
" as the tech blog @entity133 writes , @entity48 " built a very lucrative company on the reputation of user respect			0
" that was easy enough when @entity48 was small			0
as it grew , however , some people started to lose faith in the company -- and to question its motives			0
@entity133 : " in a privacy policy shift , @entity48 announced today that it will begin tracking users universally across all its services -- @entity143 , @entity144 , @entity145 and more -- and sharing data on user activity across all of them			2
so much for the @entity48 we signed up for			0
" people never talked that way about @entity20 , which only had 13 employees and 33 million users			2
it 's the kind of company journalists love to use the word " scrappy " to describe			0
as the company has grown , some people have come to trust @entity3 so little that they 're pulling photos from @entity20 in advance of the takeover			1
according to @entity166 at the @entity167 , 25,000 people visited @entity169 's site in six hours on monday after the news broke , compared with 400 people on a normal day			0
@entity169 is a service that helps people pull photos off @entity20 for home storage			1
" you could read that spike , on the one hand , as a mass freak - out on the part of users who do n't trust @entity3 -- despite @entity24 's promises -- with their networks and memories , " @entity166 writes			1
" you could also read it as an insurance play , a just - to - be - safe move on the part of people who want to feel sure that their photos are secure			0
" mistrust of @entity3 stems in part from concern about its privacy policies , which have been described as overly confusing			0
@entity3 itself acknowledges that privacy concerns could trip up the company in the future			0
in its initial public offering filing with the @entity201 , the company wrote : " we have in the past experienced , and we expect that in the future we will continue to experience , media , legislative , or regulatory scrutiny of our decisions regarding user privacy or other issues , which may adversely affect our reputation and brand			0
" finally : the cool factor			0
maybe it 's less that people see @entity3 as evil and more that the site just is n't as cool as it used to be -- partly because it 's so popular and also because it 's not the new kid on the block anymore			1
@entity24 launched @entity3 in 2004 , which is eons ago in internet time			0
@entity220 and @entity221 -- all of @entity3 's predecessors -- did n't survive ( or did n't continue to grow ) for this long			1
@entity20 , meanwhile , was founded in late 2010 and was only in recent months becoming part of the zeitgist			0
@entity227 - toting hipster types liked the app for its mobility -- you cold post photos easily from your phone -- and filters that gave their pics a retro , vintage vibe			2
" @entity20 is , in a word , cool			2
@entity3 is losing its ' cool ' , rapidly , " wrote @entity239 at the @entity240			2
@entity20 managed to create a cache in part from its status as an underground hit			0
even with tens of millions of users , the app was praised by reviewers as intimate -- a place , true or not , where it was safe to post personal photos and share stories with a relatively small network of friends			2
( just to throw in some data : i have 815 @entity3 friends but only 67 people whom i follow on @entity20 , and i actually know almost all of them			1
) it 's not clear that any of that will change for @entity20			2
@entity24 says the app will continue to operate as a product that 's independent from @entity3 and that people wo n't have to post @entity20 photos to @entity3 just because the company owns the app. but the backlash helped crystallize the idea that @entity3 no longer is seen as the always - cool company that everybody implicitly trusts			1
" some @entity20 fans are acting as if this is a tragedy , " @entity30 of the @entity31 writes of the acquisition			0
" they liked the idea that there was a little corner of the online world where they could gather and be outside the reach of the @entity24 empire			0
... " there was a time when people clamored to be part of @entity24 's network , which launched at first only for @entity288 students			0
but now , as the @entity20 backlash shows , @entity3 has long stopped being an exclusive club			1
it 's seen as the big , bland company that the app 's users worry will ruin the cool thing they had going .			1

@entity3 buying @entity20 for $ 1 billion , as photo - sharing app hits mainstream
some @entity20 users express outrage at the sale and *threaten* to pull their photos from the app
*observers* say @entity3 is n't as cool as it used to be because it 's so rich , popular and *powerful*
