" @entity15 then placed @entity2 under oath and asked him questions about the crime			1
a law enforcement source told @entity1 the decision to plead guilty was @entity2 's			1

in a news release , the @entity47 said @entity2 received explosives training from @entity42 , a militant extremist group in @entity4			1
in february , it said , he received approximately $ 5,000 in cash in @entity52 sent from a co-conspirator in @entity4 who @entity2 believed worked for @entity42 and he received $ 7,000 more in @entity54 , @entity0 , which was also sent at the co-conspirator 's direction			1
" once i got back to the states , i started working on the plan , " he said			0
" getting together what i needed for the bomb			0
i rented a place in @entity62 , @entity63			0
that is where i built the bomb , put it in the @entity67 and drove it to @entity6			0

" i consider myself a mujahedeen and a @entity28 soldier , " he said			0

" it 's a war and i 'm a part of it			0
" asked whether he understood that his actions represented a crime , he said , " i would not consider it a crime			0
... i 'm aware it 's a crime in the @entity3 , but i do n't care about the law of the @entity3			0
" a source familiar with the case told @entity1 that prosecutors will ask for the maximum sentence on the charges during sentencing , which is scheduled for october 5			1
the source said there was no plea deal and no cooperation deal			0
that means that , despite the fact that @entity2 cooperated with prosecutors for two weeks after his arrest , they will not request any preferential treatment for him			2
of the 10 charges , six carry a maximum sentence of life : attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction , conspiracy to use a weapon of mass destruction , possession of a firearm in relation to conspiracy to use a weapon of mass destruction , attempted act of terrorism transcending national boundaries , conspiracy to commit an act of terrorism , and attempted use of a destructive device in relation to conspiracy to commit an act of terrorism			1
because @entity2 pleaded guilty to count 3 , count 6 carries a mandatory minimum penalty of life in prison			1
counts 7 and 8 -- transportation of an explosive and conspiracy to transport an explosive -- each carry a maximum sentence of 10 years			1
counts 9 and 10 -- attempted destruction of property by fire and explosives and conspiracy to destroy property by fire and explosives -- each carries a maximum sentence of 20 years			2
@entity2 's arrest heightened concerns about the @entity4 @entity42 , who authorities believe directed the @entity6 plot			2
@entity3 intelligence officials fear that the @entity42 are plotting to strike within the @entity3 and are targeting @entity3 interests overseas			0
