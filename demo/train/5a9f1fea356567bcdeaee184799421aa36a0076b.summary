nevertheless , the @entity7 college student is going to resist searching for her when he leads a group of students into @entity4 in may			1
" i 'm dying to go to @entity15 right now , " said @entity10 , 22 , a @entity11 senior in chemistry who lost three cousins in the january 12 earthquake			1
he was told that his mother and other family members moved " to the countryside , " but he does n't know whether she 's in a house or under a tarp			1
because @entity11 's @entity4 is a student - led organization without chaperones , @entity10 is responsible for all 25 people on the trip , " and i do n't feel that [ searching for his family ] is the best course of action for us			1
" @entity10 said he 'll go back on his own during the summer " to do what i can in @entity15 and to seek out my family			1
" @entity4 had planned to visit the @entity36 orphanage near the central town of @entity38 during spring break in march , but the earthquake forced the group to wait until the week between final exams and graduation			1
" it never occurred to me that i should n't go			1
it made me more determined to go , " said @entity11 psychology senior @entity45 , 21 , of @entity46 , @entity47			1
" originally the plan was to go over spring break , and i 'd never had an interest in going anywhere where it was just about lying around and partying , and that 's not me at all , " she added			2
" so i wanted to do something that would actually be worthwhile over my break			2
" @entity45 's roommate , @entity57 , 21 , of @entity58 , @entity47 , desires to bring hope and encouragement to @entity36			2
@entity57 , a senior business student , said she wants " to go there and help children and to see them smile and have them feel like someone loves them and someone cares about them			1
and also to show them there 's more to the world than where they are right now , and they can do whatever they want to do			2
" each @entity11 student will bring to the orphanage two suitcases stuffed with clothes and other supplies for the children			1
the group holds fundraisers throughout the school year and a " packing party " shortly before departure			2

the project is no longer affiliated with the church , which several years ago reassigned @entity87 to an abbey in @entity96 , @entity47			2
" i 'm a cheerleader on the sidelines , " @entity87 said			2
" ... our culture has such a lack of faith in young people , but there 's a lot of good stuff happening out there			2
" @entity10 , who will participate in @entity107 after graduation , has been to @entity36 twice before			2
" we drive into the complex , and all the kids are waiting for us			2
it 's almost like a parade , like we 're important , " he said			0
" ... it 's an absolutely awesome experience			0
it 's like elephants ; they will not forget you			0
and if you make a promise , they will hold you to that			0
i owe someone an @entity124			0
" @entity11 alumna @entity125 made the trip in 2000 and became president of @entity4 the following year			1

" it was kind of crazy how it all came full circle			0
my first time of doing a project in another country was actually @entity4 , and it just kind of planted this seed , " said @entity125 , 29 , of @entity144 , @entity145			0
she said all college students should be given the opportunity to serve in another country			1
" it 's so mutually beneficial			0
i realized pretty quickly that it was n't just me helping other people			1
it totally changed my perspective on the world , and it was such a good lesson to have learned			0
you can sit in class in college forever and you just do n't learn the same kind of things that you would learn in one day in @entity4			1
" three students from @entity165 in @entity166 , @entity167 , are going ahead with a working spring break in @entity4			1

" i 'm excited i have an opportunity to help , " said @entity188 , 24 , an architecture graduate student from @entity195 , @entity167			0
immediately after the quake , only people with rescue or medical skills were needed in @entity4 , but " by the time we get down there , the next wave -- the rebuilders -- are going to be needed , " she said			0
she hopes seeing people coming to help them rebuild will give @entity205 hope			0
the man who created the program agreed			0
" @entity4 does n't need a bunch of @entity7 coming down and doing it for them , they just need some @entity7 to come down and do it with them , " said @entity165 alumnus @entity208 , the architect and builder who founded @entity182 after the 2004 @entity211 tsunami			1
@entity174 , a 20 - year - old junior from @entity213 , @entity167 , studying computer engineering , said he has used previous breaks as a pause for partying			0
but he 's up for working in the sun in @entity4			0
" they need our help now more than ever , " he said			0
@entity222 wants the trip to have an impact at home as well as in @entity4			0
" i just hope the work i do down there can inspire others to give back to their communities and the world in general , " he said			0
