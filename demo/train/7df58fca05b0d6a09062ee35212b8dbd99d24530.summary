-- with world no. 1 @entity2 struggling at the @entity3 , a tired @entity4 exiting early , and third - ranked @entity5 limping out of contention , the scene is set for renewed protests by tennis stars about their testing tournament schedule			1
but @entity12 , perhaps the greatest of them all , has flatly rejected the notion that players should go on strike			1
" it was brought up a few months ago , the whole boycott thing			0
it 's nonsense , " the 16 - time grand slam champion told reporters after clinching his third successive @entity21 win at the season - ending event on thursday			2
" it 's not going to happen anytime soon			0
things are good right now , so i do n't see a reason why we should just boycott			0
there 's absolutely no reason for it			2
" can @entity12 make finals history ? @entity5 's call for a players ' meeting before last month 's @entity37 did not eventuate in any action , and the @entity39 himself later stated that he did not think a strike was necessary -- but that the issue of fixture scheduling needed to be addressed			1
@entity12 took a long break after the @entity44 in september , while @entity4 also had a rest with next month 's @entity47 final between @entity48 and @entity49 in mind			1
tsonga sends @entity4 tumbling out of finals @entity2 , meanwhile , had to take time out due to the back and shoulder injuries which have plagued the end of his sensational season			0
the @entity58 looked a weary figure in his second match in @entity61 on wednesday as he lost to @entity5 's opening conqueror @entity62 in straight sets			1
@entity5 pulled out of the tournament the day before , citing a groin injury he suffered in training last week			2
@entity68 to @entity4 : @entity70 ' popstar makeover but @entity12 is on course to become the first man to win the @entity3 championships six times after overcoming @entity75 6 - 1 3 - 6 6 - 3 to eliminate the eighth - ranked @entity76			1
the defending champion , who is president of the @entity78 , said a strike makes no sense			0
" it 's not been an option really , in my opinion			0
next year 's season is going to be shortened by two weeks , " he said			0
" that 's , i think , as much as we can squeeze it really because otherwise a lot of tournaments would have to go , or we would have four tournaments the same week , which i do n't think is a very smart idea , to be honest , for the game			2
