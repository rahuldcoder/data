@entity1 president @entity0 said he is expelling the @entity2 from his country for allegedly meddling and conspiring against the government			1
" @entity2 is out ; i ask the foreign minister to immediately communicate with the @entity12 embassy , " @entity5 said in a speech wednesday , according to the state - run @entity8 news agency			1
according to @entity2 's @entity1 website , the agency has operated there since 1964			1
it says it carries out health , sustainable development and environmental programs in the country			0
the agency says its 2011 budget for @entity1 was $ 26.7 million			0
the @entity23 called the decision regrettable and said the ones who will be hurt by the expulsion will be ordinary @entity1			2
" we deny the baseless allegations made by the @entity1 government , " @entity23 spokesman @entity28 said of the accusations that the agency meddled in @entity1 affairs			1
after @entity5 ' announcement wednesday , @entity1 's foreign minister called the @entity37 in @entity38 to inform officials of the decision and said @entity2 would be given a " reasonable " amount of time to end operations , which employ nine @entity12 and 37 @entity1 , @entity28 said			1
@entity1 and the @entity12 have had diminished relations since september 2008 , when each country expelled the other 's ambassador			1
@entity5 , a strong proponent of the cultivation of coca plants -- the source of cocaine -- expelled the @entity52 a month later			0
he also delivered a strong verbal criticism of the @entity12 government at the @entity56 that year			0
the order to expel @entity2 appeared to be off - the - cuff , but it 's not the first time it 's been suggested			2
in 2011 , an influential @entity1 official accused the agency of " destabilizing " the government and called for its ouster			0
" the expulsion of @entity2 should be ... an act of sovereignty , " @entity65 , director of a @entity1 government development agency and a former top presidential aide , said at the time			1
the move is also in protest of a comment made by @entity12 secretary of state @entity74 at a hearing in @entity76 last month , @entity5 said			1
in response to a question about @entity79 , @entity74 told lawmakers that " the @entity81 is our backyard			2
it 's critical to us			0
" to many in the @entity12 , the reference to " backyard " would mean that the @entity81 is a neighbor			0
but @entity5 took offense , apparently interpreting the phrase as derogatory toward @entity79 's place in relation to the @entity12			2
a history of @entity12 policy toward @entity79 that asserted @entity12 dominance over the region made @entity74 's phrase stinging to some			1
the phrase " @entity79 's backyard " harkens back to the @entity101 , which considered @entity79 under the influence of the @entity12			0
" we may be a small country , but we deserve respect , " said @entity5 , stating his offense to being called the " back patio " of the @entity12			2
@entity28 said @entity74 did not intend to offend anyone with his remarks			0
" it 's about us being neighbors , " he said .			0

@entity12 calls allegations by @entity1 president " baseless "
was a comment by @entity74 partly responsible for @entity1 's expulsion of @entity2 ?
@entity5 made the announcement , then told his foreign minister to *contact* @entity12
@entity12 - @entity1 relations have been strained for years
