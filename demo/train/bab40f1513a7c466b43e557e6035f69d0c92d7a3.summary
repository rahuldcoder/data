@entity0 -- a spanish - language newspaper in @entity3 has drawn bipartisan criticism for publishing a doctored photograph depicting the state 's new governor as a @entity8			1
@entity3 editor @entity9 said the picture was meant to call attention to @entity13 issues -- and grab the attention of residents and politicians who often ignore the @entity13 community			1
" @entity18 do n't read our paper because they ca n't read @entity21			0
they do n't read our news , our editorials and the opinion of the community			0
but if they see a picture , they 'll get it , " he said			2
the photo illustration , published in the paper 's january 6 edition , shows @entity33 gov. @entity32 wearing a @entity8 uniform , a swastika armband and a @entity37 - like mustache			1
the accompanying story , entitled " repression in the @entity45 , " recaps an ethics investigation against @entity40 and talks about the governor 's past financial troubles			1
the full - page article also quotes local community leaders forecasting tough times ahead for illegal immigrants in the state			2
one leader quoted is @entity53 state rep. @entity52 -- one of only two @entity13 legislators in @entity3			1
@entity52 condemned the photo and said he did not know about it when he spoke to the newspaper			2
" it is disrespectful , " @entity52 said			0
" i might disagree with the policies of @entity60 , but i respect him and the office he represents			0
" @entity52 said he understands firsthand what it means to be the target of inflammatory rhetoric			0
" ever since i got elected and began supporting immigrant issues , i have received hate mail and my house and car have been vandalized , " he said			0
@entity52 said the photo might make it harder for the @entity13 community to communicate with state leaders			0
@entity32 , who took office earlier this month , has not spoken out about the photo			1
his spokesman , @entity77 , issued a statement saying , " those who ca n't formulate a coherent argument in our society 's marketplace of ideas often resort to childish , even offensive tactics			2
" @entity9 , who immigrated to the @entity18 from @entity87 , said he printed the picture knowing he did n't have to fear retaliation from the governor because of the freedom of speech guaranteed by the @entity18 @entity92			1
@entity93 recognizes that right , but also said that responsibility comes with freedom , adding that " it is a shame that he decided to print the photo to sell more papers " @entity3 prints about 40,000 copies every month			1
@entity9 admits that after other local media started to report on the controversy , traffic to the paper 's website rose to record levels			0
but @entity9 said the picture represents the fear immigrants in @entity3 feel with the arrival of @entity32 to the state 's top office , because of @entity40 's strong anti-immigrant rhetoric during the last campaign			1
@entity9 pointed to @entity32 's support of legislation similar to laws enacted in @entity117 aimed at tough enforcement against illegal immigrants			1
@entity32 was elected last november			2
he won the @entity33 primary , edging out a former secretary of state who was endorsed by former @entity123 gov. @entity122			0
then he defeated @entity124 and former governor @entity125			0
both of @entity40 's rivals also supported immigration legislation similar to @entity117 's .			0

the newspaper 's editor says he *wanted* to grab the attention of readers
he says the picture represents the fear immigrants in @entity3 feel as @entity32 becomes governor
a governor 's spokesman describes the illustration as " pathetic "
a *lawmaker* describes the photo as " disrespectful "
