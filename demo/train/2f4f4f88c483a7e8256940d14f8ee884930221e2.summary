-- air travelers across the country are breathing a sigh of relief that they might get to their destinations on time after @entity7 took action to roll back a part of the automatic spending cuts that forced furloughs on air traffic controllers			1
as someone with a 2,300 - mile commute , i understand the frustration that travelers felt as delays tripled to nearly 9,000 by thursday evening -- i am pleased air traffic controllers are back on the job full - time			2
i am not relieved , however , that @entity7 gave the @entity22 administration authority to end furloughs but has not yet done a single thing to help the many @entity25 who are suffering the consequences of these cuts			1
@entity7 made a @entity29 fix when sequestration needs a triple - bypass surgery			1
in my district , and across the country , kids are being turned away from early education programs like @entity36			2
children in military communities are being hit especially hard because federal dollars that support their schools have been slashed			2
and communities are reporting that funding cuts are forcing them to kick some seniors off @entity44			1
but it was business travelers and vacationers who took center stage last week , and it was for them alone that @entity7 acted			1
on friday morning , just hours before many in @entity7 would head to the airport to catch flights home for a weeklong district work period , the @entity50 voted to end the furloughs of air traffic controllers			1
airline passengers can now count on more reliable service			0
but the kids in my district who are losing their school bus ca n't book a flight to class			0
when @entity7 passed sequestration , it was considered such an unthinkable option with such unfathomable consequences that it would have to be replaced			2
members from both sides of the aisle gave long speeches about the harm that would come if we allowed the sequester to go into place unmodified			0
and yet @entity77 seemed to be shocked , shocked , to find flight delays ripple through airports across the country			0
they ran to television cameras to point fingers at president @entity22 , saying these delays were preventable			0
i am not sure what they expected to happen			0
it would be irrational to expect that we can cut more than $ 600 million from the @entity90 budget in six months and not see effects on the flying public			0
just as we should not expect that we can cut 4 million meals to seniors , as the @entity95 reports , and not hurt them			0
everyone in @entity25 who watched @entity0 last week learned the sequester has real consequences			0
while members of @entity7 are n't getting a lot of calls for 4 - year - olds being turned away from @entity36 programs , that does n't mean they do n't exist			1
their voices may not be as loud as air travelers were last week , but their pain is greater			1
@entity7 can and should pass legislation that will replace the entire sequester with a balanced approach to deficit reduction that includes spending cuts , reduction in future spending growth , and new revenues			1
we need to fix it			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity120 .			2
