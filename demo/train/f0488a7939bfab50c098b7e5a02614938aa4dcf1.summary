-- if you grew up in the 1980s there 's nothing guaranteed to make you feel older than a trip to the movies			2
" @entity6 " , " @entity7 " and " footloose " ... what 's next ? " @entity10 " ? but if there have to be remakes , then let them all be as much fun as @entity16 's " footloose			1
" @entity16 's previous movies , " @entity18 " and " @entity19 , " were southern exploitation pictures with a smooth retro gloss , their sleazy trappings disguising a heart of pure vanilla			1
but both showed a real feel for music : hip - hop and 12 - bar blues respectively			2
that 's a good starting point when it comes to " footloose , " a fairly trite rock - n - roll rebellion story that 's redeemed by its faith in dance			1
the 1984 original was the first screenplay by songwriter @entity38 , and @entity16 sticks close enough to the template that @entity38 shares a screenplay credit with him here			1
both versions get bogged down in silly speechifying , but in almost every respect @entity16 's high fidelity cover version improves on the previous movie			1
it 's sharper , punchier , better written and mostly better acted too			0
if anything the city - country cultural divide cuts deeper today than it did in the @entity50 era , but @entity16 shifts the action a few degrees south and navigates a more even - handed course between them			2
his small town , @entity55 , @entity56 , is quite sympathetically drawn			0
and if the city by - laws prohibiting loud music , drink and public dancing make the local elders come off like the @entity64 , @entity58 's @entity57 is not the shrill evangelical caricature @entity66 played , but a concerned parent and pastor who assumes responsibility for protecting his flock in the wake of a personal tragedy			0
as @entity74 , the urban hipster who is taken in by his uncle after his mom dies , @entity73 does n't eclipse @entity80 's star - making performance , but he 's an attractive actor who refrains from posturing			1
and he 's a sensational dancer			0
" @entity83 " alum @entity82 -- who plays @entity84 , the wild preacher 's daughter -- has the trickier challenge of showing us a young woman acting out , sexually , and frankly seems a shade too mature to carry it off			0
that 's partly @entity16 's fault -- @entity84 does n't get the chance to explain herself until too late in the day , and it does n't help that @entity82 seems to have been made up to look like a young @entity94			1
but again , she comes into her own in the dance numbers			0
@entity97 gives ' footloose ' a 3 out of 5 because he 's cast real dancers , @entity16 does n't have to slice and dice the choreography : the music sequences ( including eight new numbers and the four biggest hits from the 84 version ) are dynamic and exciting			1
the choreography runs from line dancing to hip - hop and krumping , as well as a cute , funny sequence in which @entity74 's flat - footed buddy @entity111 ( @entity111 ) learns rhythm from a posse of five - year - old girls			2
granted , it could never best the original for , you know , originality , but now -- as then -- " footloose " is an irresistible celebration of young bodies in motion			0
altogether now : loose , footloose , kick off your sunday shoes ...			0

@entity16 's " footloose " is a fun remake of the 1984 *classic*
@entity73 does n't eclipse @entity80 's performance , but he 's an attractive actor
because he 's cast real dancers , @entity16 does n't have to slice and dice the choreography
