-- the string of attacks at the @entity3 in the past two weeks has sparked terrible memories of a week in august 1990 that sent a tsunami of fear through the student population and the city of @entity10			1
unlike the most recent attempted assaults around campus , the victims in 1990 did n't have a chance			1
for five students that year , assaults ended in dismemberment and death			1
the first attack happened the sunday before school started			0
@entity10 police were called to check on two students in their apartment			2
when they arrived , the scene horrified them			0
both @entity29 and @entity30 had been stabbed to death , one of them mutilated , her body posed in a sexually explicit manner			0
within 72 hours , five students were fatally stabbed , the crime scenes staged for dramatic effect			2
police soon surmised @entity10 had a serial killer in its midst and it appeared @entity3 students were his targets			1
i was a freshman back then and remember students being pulled out of school by their parents , who feared their children would be the killer 's next victim			1
the killer was entering students ' apartments , usually through sliding glass doors , as people slept			1
police said he was likely stalking his prey and was very meticulous , staging crime scenes and cleaning them up to avoid detection			0
there was a sense that no one was safe at night			0
every day the killer roamed free and gruesome details surfaced , a wave of fear swept across the city			1
gun stores began selling out , students traveled in groups or left campus entirely			1
the university even offered to reimburse tuition for those too afraid to return			2
eventually , we all learned and memorized the names of the five students killed : @entity30 , @entity29 , @entity76 , @entity77 and @entity78			1
after @entity78 was killed , fear increased , because it became clear men would not be spared and were just as vulnerable			1
by the time the killer was caught and about to go to trial , i was nearing graduation			2
it happened that as a student journalist working at the university television and radio station , i ended up covering the trial			2
i was among those allowed to view the crime scene photos that were entered into evidence			0
i have never been able to get those scenes out of my head			0
the worst : a picture of a victim 's body on a bed with her severed head staring down from a bookshelf			2
it is the stuff of nightmares			0
they were haunting , purposely theatrical photos that were pornographic in nature due to the positioning of the bodies			0
all of them seemed to be scenes from a horror film too gruesome to make			0
" i was here then , " @entity3 vice president of student affairs @entity111 said of those difficult days in 1990			1
" this community came together , unified and i really think that the closeness that was forged during that terrible time really is what you are seeing today			0
" this is a campus that never forgets			0
long after serial killer @entity119 confessed to the killings and was executed by the state in 2006 , a memorial to the five students he killed remains .			1
