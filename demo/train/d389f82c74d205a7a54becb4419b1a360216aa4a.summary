which has shortened its name to " @entity2 " or " is " , led by @entity6 , its self - proclaimed caliph , has hit a new low			2
having spread across huge swathes of @entity3 and @entity4 , leaving absolute devastation in its wake , its latest offensive has brought it to @entity13 , a city in the north western region of @entity15 in @entity3 and home to at least 200,000 of the world 's 700,000 members of the @entity20 faith @entity1 has always worn its love for sectarianism on its sleeve , and its vicious hatred for @entity20 has been no mystery			1
repeatedly , disturbing videos have been circulated on social media depicting @entity20 held in tiny cells being cruelly taunted by @entity1 prison guards			1
on top of this , " is " propagandists have continuously warned of their intention to execute or enslave the adherents of this ancient @entity36 - linked religion , whom they view as " devil worshippers " on account of their revering a fallen angel			0
therefore , it should come as no surprise that , when it seemed that @entity1 were about to sweep into @entity13 last week , thousands upon thousands of @entity20 fled from their homes			1
tragically , alongside the local yazidis that fled were others who had taken refuge in @entity13 the month before , when @entity1 captured @entity49 , a neighboring city			1
everyone 's fears proved to be rightly placed , with @entity1 fiercely battling and soon routing the @entity52 , leaving them in control of @entity54 and many of its surroundings			1
while most fled to refugee camps in semi-autonomous @entity3 @entity58 , some 30,000 families ended up on @entity13 , where they are now stranded , surrounded by jihadists			1
they are forced to sleep in caves , faced with temperatures of over 50 degrees @entity62 ( 122 degrees @entity63 ) and have no food or water , let alone arms to defend themselves with			0
initially , they could contact the outside world using mobile phones			0
now , though , most of these have run out of battery and there is no telling how critical the situation has become			0
what is for certain is that their prospects for escape are minimal			0
this is yet another instance of the appalling brutality of " is " , a group that has consistently abused the most basic human rights of the people it has forced itself upon			0
over the last two months , it has committed countless mass summary executions of @entity89 soldiers and tortured and shot hundreds of @entity91 tribespeople who resisted its rule before taking to social media to boast about their actions			0
likewise , it recently gave the entire @entity98 population of @entity99 a choice -- either they leave their homes and livelihoods , or they pay a tax to is on the basis of their religion			2
those who refused to do either faced death			0
the list of human rights offenses goes on			0
these jihadists are making a mockery of international law			2
it is becoming increasingly clear that they will not stop committing these criminal acts unless they are forced to stop			2
unfortunately , the prospects for this are becoming more remote by the day , as @entity1 fighters continue from strength to strength , capturing most of north - west @entity4 's largest military facilities and repelling all counter attacks by the @entity125 ( @entity125 )			1
we , the international community , must not turn a blind eye to what 's happening in on @entity13 like we did in the wake of the expulsion of @entity132 or the mass executions of @entity89 soldiers			1
what 's transpiring now is a new @entity135 , an ethno - religious cleansing on a huge scale			1
that it is taking place at the hands of a jihadist group too extreme for @entity142 , a group that has repeatedly shown that it has internationalist ambitions , is all the more worrying			0
it is ludicrous that no one has acted against it already when it is clear that neither the @entity125 nor the @entity52 is capable of shutting it down alone			2
@entity1 has acted with impunity in the region for far too long			1
it has been allowed to take control of an area larger than the @entity153 , commandeer hundreds of thousands of dollars of @entity155 - made weaponry and subjugate nearly 6 million people			1
the international community needs to step up to this most troubling challenge			1
it must provide substantial and coordinated humanitarian assistance to all refugees and internally displaced people -- of any faith or ethnicity -- in the region			0
furthermore , diplomatic pressure must be exerted on @entity166 , the only military power in the region that stands a chance of crushing this false caliphate			0
@entity171 must be ready to bury its differences with the @entity58 and extend all the assistance it can to them on a human rights basis , even if this means military support			0
lastly , it is imperative that states across the world reaffirm their absolute commitment to article 18 of the @entity181 , which establishes the right to free thought , conscience and belief			0
if we do not stand by our principles , who will ? it is not enough to just condemn something with rhetoric ; the world must react robustly and directly to these reprehensible developments			2
the views expressed in this commentary are solely @entity195 's .			1

@entity1 has taken control of @entity54 in @entity3 , home to members of the @entity20 religious minority
thousands fled from their homes , with some 30,000 families now stranded
@entity195 says @entity1 ' hatred of the @entity20 is clear and a " new @entity135 " is transpiring
he says rhetoric is not enough and the international community must take action to halt @entity1
