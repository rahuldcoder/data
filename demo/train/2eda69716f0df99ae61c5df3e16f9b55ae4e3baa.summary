the @entity0 approved a $ 1.1 trillion spending measure saturday night funding most of the government through september , removing the threat of a shutdown for much of 2015			1
the bipartisan 56 - 40 vote sends the bill to president @entity7 , who is expected to sign it into law			1
passage closes a chapter of yet another fiscal battle on @entity13			0
it came after attempts to delay the legislation by liberals who sought to strip out a policy provision that eases a @entity20 regulation and conservatives who tried to slow action on immigration			1
in fact , the @entity0 would not have been in session this weekend if it had n't been for a small band of conservatives who sabotaged an agreement by @entity29 leader @entity28 and @entity30 leader @entity30 , who wanted to vote on the bill monday			1
in a late friday night procedural sneak attack , carried out after @entity33 left the @entity13 , the group led by sen. @entity35 , @entity36 , forced the @entity0 to stay			1
they also pressed to get a vote on a measure to declare the bill unconstitutional because it funds what they say is " illegal amnesty " included in the president 's recent executive orders on immigration			1
the move by rank - and - file members to undermine an agreement between the @entity0 leaders is highly unusual and may reflect the difficulty incoming majority leader @entity33 will face managing the @entity0 when the new @entity53 convenes next month			2
" every @entity56 candidate all across the country said we 'll do everything humanly possible to stop president @entity7 's illegal amnesty			1
we 're honoring those commitments , " @entity35 said as he shuttled between strategy sessions in the @entity13 with his cohorts sen. @entity64 of @entity65 , sen. @entity66 of @entity67 , and sen. @entity68 of @entity69			0
" they 're going to get nothing out of this , " said sen. @entity71 , @entity72 , who , like a lot of senators , was frustrated by @entity35 's tactics and predicted he would not succeed in scuttling the bill			0
" this is absolute utter nonsense for us to be here			0
" @entity35 ultimately did receive a vote challenging the funding bill because it included money for the @entity84 , which is carrying out the president 's recent executive actions on immigration			1
@entity35 and other republicans say the president 's orders are unconstitutional			0
though his challenge failed , the senator wanted a vote to " ensure that every senator will be on record regarding the constitutionality of president @entity7 's illegal amnesty , " @entity91 , @entity35 's press secretary , emailed reporters early saturday ahead of the vote			1
@entity29 took advantage of the saturday session to begin procedure votes on 24 nominations , including some controversial ones like @entity107 for director of @entity109 , @entity110 for surgeon general , and @entity112 for commissioner of the @entity114			0
a senior @entity29 leadership aide said some of the nominees would most likely have not received a vote because of timing and senators leaving for the holidays			0
" we gave away literally nothing , and we got a number of nominees we would not have been able to confirm if we had n't been in session today , " the aide said			0
before the unusual weekend session , much of the drama over the spending bill was in the @entity131 , where @entity132 speaker @entity132 and @entity7 formed an unusual alliance to quell their own parties ' rebellions -- led on the left by minority leader @entity136 , @entity137 , and sen. @entity138 , @entity139			2
all the maneuvering was an ominous sign of what 's to come now that this @entity53 is wrapping up its work and a new one is set to start in january			0
@entity132 and soon - to - be senate majority leader @entity33 are still struggling to rein in tea party conservatives who are itching for more showdowns over @entity7 's immigration policies , the health care law , the debt ceiling and more			1
and @entity29 who had been loyal to @entity7 now find they no longer need the president , especially since many of the party 's more centrist members lost their seats in a midterm election that saw @entity56 gain control of the @entity0 and expand their advantage in the @entity131			1
" this by definition was a compromise bill			0
this is what is produced when you have a divided government that the @entity168 people voted for , " @entity7 told reporters friday			2
" had i been able to draft my own legislation , get it passed without any @entity56 votes , i suspect it would be slightly different , " he said			0
" that is not the circumstance we find ourselves in and i think what the @entity168 people very much are looking for is responsible governance and the willingness to compromise , and that 's what we 've clearly done , " @entity7 added			2
beyond keeping the government open , the spending bill includes dozens of far - reaching policy provisions			2
it blocks a voter - approved law in the @entity186 , that legalizes marijuana and blunts a school lunch program championed by first lady @entity189 .			0

the 1.1 trillion spending measure passes the @entity0 with a vote of 56:40
