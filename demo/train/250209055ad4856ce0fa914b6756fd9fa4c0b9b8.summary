@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 drivers spend a lot of time talking about the gym and going jogging			1
@entity8 's @entity7 has to spend a lot of time in the gym to be fit enough to race			2
even when they 're on holiday there is a gym close at hand -- in fact many list fitness as a hobby , which is a little on the sad side			1
however , they 're exercise obsessed for a good reason : without being in peak fitness they would not be able to handle the stresses of driving a @entity3 car at 350kmh			1
it 's perhaps the one situation where sitting down for up to two hours is actually very , very tiring			0
according to @entity8 , their drivers -- @entity31 and @entity7 -- would not last a race without getting sweaty in the gym			1
" the highly - efficient carbon brakes slow a car down so rapidly and the downforce generated by current aerodynamics is such that a driver experiences a peak of around @entity41 under braking and in high - speed corners , " the team said			1
" this affects the whole body but has its most dramatic consequence on the neck and chest			0
" the team said for a " typical person " the forces were almost unimaginable , the closest comparison they could make was with a rollercoaster -- though that is some way off			1
during a race , most drivers had an average heart rate around 170 beats per minute -- higher than most other athletes -- with a peak of 190 , @entity8 said			1
moreover , this season -- with traction control removed -- the drivers heartbeats had increased up to 10 beats a minute			1
@entity7 said @entity3 was unique when it came to the fitness requirements			1
" i would say it 's completely different to any other sport because you have a heartbeat average of 170 over an hour and a half and you never see that in another sport , " @entity7 said			0
" that makes it completely different			0
that 's the reason why you have to be really fit as a @entity3 driver			1
" @entity8 team doctor @entity77 said the drivers had to have a very high aerobic fitness level			1
" they go jogging , cycling , all sports that involve aerobic area			2
the second part of the training is specific for the neck			0
they need a very strong neck because every corner puts a load of around 20 - 25kgs on the neck , and obviously a strong upper body and forearms			0
" @entity77 said keeping the brain in top condition was also important			2
" the brain is just like a muscle and you can train it			0
" he has developed computer simulations which could test -- and improve -- reaction times , multi-tasking and spatial awareness			2
@entity31 said he used the above to ensure he was mentally prepared for a race			0
" we do mental preparation with some of these simulations which have been developed through the years			0
i can easily do them at home or even during the @entity111 weekend using my computer			0
" it 's all about keeping concentration and trying to be fit and concentrated for a race distance , which is not so easy in a @entity3 car because obviously it 's very quick			1
" @entity77 said studies had shown a marked difference between how racing drivers and normal people responded to the tests			2
" the difference is that the driver is much more economical in managing this performance , so his brain is working in an economical way compared to a normal person			0
" that means he is able to carry on this performance for a longer time compared to a normal person			0
that is the important point we have to consider in the training			2

@entity3 drivers ' hearts beat up to 190 times a minute during races
heart rate is above most other athletes , making aerobic fitness very important
drivers have to deal with forces of up to @entity41 during races
