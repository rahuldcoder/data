-- @entity2 manager @entity1 was not even alive the last time his club claimed a home win over @entity5 in the top - flight			1
@entity1 was born on july 14 , 1963 , just two months after @entity2 had pulled off victory against a @entity5 team which would go on to win the @entity9 three days later			1
led by the prolific @entity10 , @entity5 went on to defeat a @entity12 side which had won the trophy in each of the previous two years and claim the title as the first @entity16 team to have won the competition			2
what a contrast to that of a few days earlier when @entity2 pulled off a famous victory , courtesy of a goal from @entity23 -- a player on loan from @entity5 's famous rivals , @entity26			1
back to the future fast forward to the present day and @entity1 was hoping his side could reverse their awful record against the @entity5			0
it began in perfect fashion when @entity32 headed home @entity34 's corner with just 11 minutes on the clock			2
@entity5 stuns leaders @entity37 @entity5 , looking for back - to - back wins in @entity40 for the first time this season following its victory against @entity37 last week , looked lethargic in the opening exchanges			0
@entity44 should have doubled @entity2 's advantage but sent his free header wide of the goal from just six - yards			1
it was not until the second period that @entity5 really began to exert its dominance and even then it took the sending off of @entity52 to inspire them			2
red card @entity52 , already on a booking , only had himself to blame after taking a pointless swipe at @entity57 which earned him a second yellow card			0
that gave @entity5 the boost it was looking for and @entity61 fired home a 53rd minute equalizer			0
@entity5 forged into the lead three minutes later as @entity65 beat @entity66 , before unleashing a rasping effort into the top corner			1
@entity5 continued to dominate with @entity69 and @entity70 both missing glorious opportunities to seal the points , while @entity73 hit a post			0
@entity5 were reduced to 10 - men in the final minute when @entity65 was dismissed for a rash challenge			1
but @entity61 sealed the win , bending home his second of the night and 12th of the season to fire @entity5 up to seventh place and leave @entity1 dreaming of that famous victory .			0

@entity5 comes from behind to defeat @entity2 3 - 1
