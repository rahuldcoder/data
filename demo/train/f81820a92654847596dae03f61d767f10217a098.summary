-- a @entity2 panel investigating alleged war crimes in the @entity5 conflict has found credible evidence that the military shelled civilians in no - fire zones and sought to silence critics in brutal fashion , according to the panel 's report , leaked to a @entity5 newspaper			1
the report contradicts claims by the @entity5 government that it adopted a policy of " zero civilian casualties " in the final stages of its bloody 25 - year battle with the @entity24 rebels			1

" it shelled the @entity2 hub , food distribution lines and near the @entity38 ships that were coming to pick up the wounded and their relatives from the beaches			0
it shelled in spite of its knowledge of the impact			0
... most civilian casualties in the final phases of the war were caused by government shelling			2

the report says the @entity89 , who fought fiercely to secure an independent state for minority tamils , " refused civilians permission to leave , using them as hostages , at times even using their presence as a strategic human buffer between themselves and the advancing @entity5 army			1

the government , the report says , " systematically shelled hospitals on the frontlines			2

sometimes , it says , those who were singled out as suspects were summarily executed			0
" if proven , those most responsible , including @entity138 commanders and senior government officials , as well as military and civilian @entity89 leaders , would bear criminal liability for international crimes , " the report says			1
