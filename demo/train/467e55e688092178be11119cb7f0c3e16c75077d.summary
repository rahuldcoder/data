-- more than half a million people a year flock to the @entity2 , @entity3 's most accessible wilderness , to see its impressive peaks and ancient rainforest			1
but @entity3 is grappling with a dilemma : how to balance conservation with the need for tourist spending			1
" although it looks gorgeous and beautiful it is a park under pressure -- there are a lot of vulnerable species in this national park , " said @entity11 , a local teacher and president of @entity14			1
" it 's not a completely resilient piece of nature we can do anything with			1
" maintaining wilderness is an expensive business , and visitor numbers have fallen in recent years			2
the number of trips including an overnight stay has almost halved in the last decade , from 1.045 million in 1999 , according to @entity33 figures quoted in the @entity34			0
they show an 18 percent drop in one year , from 687,000 in 2008 to 563,000 last year			1
the @entity38 government now wants to increase both tourist numbers and spending by attracting visitors interested in a more comfortable , less rugged experience			1
its tourism strategy has attracted criticism for refusing to rule out development within the park			1
@entity47 , who runs a hotel in @entity49 , the main tourist town in the @entity51 , just an hour and a half from @entity53 , said : " we 're very concerned because the uniqueness of area revolves around the fact that we sit in between @entity59 parks			1
" so the fact that they are looking at developing , the fact that if there is a potential to do it , it 's not right for this area			2
" it 's not in @entity53 's interests to see this area develop -- the attraction for @entity53 people to come here is our lack of development			1
" @entity72 agreed : " what i see happening in @entity38 is a distraction and diversion away from nature conservation as the primary purpose of parks -- and if we do n't focus on that the standards and the state of our parks will slowly decline			2
" however , @entity82 , chairman of @entity83 , argued that it is possible to develop sustainable tourism without damaging the natural beauty that visitors come to see			1
" if there was increased interest in development , i think those investors would only do it in terms of : is it sustainable ? " said @entity82			0
" is there going to be a return on investment ? and it 's going to be in built - up areas where zoning allows it			2
i do n't think there would be any development that would be a negative impact on the environment			0
" " we have to have a sustainable impact on the natural asset , which all tourism operators value and treasure and want to preserve			2
" @entity110 , a government advisor on conservation and tourism , also believes the park has to develop			1
she said : " everybody is looking for how we can make national parks relevant into the future			0
we have very urbanized population who are not as connected with nature			0
" the @entity38 government wanted to see how we could connect with nature but also at the same time stimulate regional economies through tourism activities related to nature conservation			1
" i ca n't think of a better way to persuade somebody to be an advocate for a beautiful and wild area than going there and immersing themselves in that experience , " she added			0
the danger in this quest for something new , is turning nature into a commodity , argued @entity72			0
" i think national parks and nature is worth more than just being the new thing , the sort of new product , " she said			0
" we have 92 percent of the state of @entity38 that is taken up by people			2
" only eight percent is national park			0
they 're the bits that we 've put aside for nature -- do we really need to encroach on those as well			0
" the coffee shop is not an endangered species			0
humans are doing very well -- we are looking after ourselves very well			0
at some point we need to say : ' when is it nature 's turn ? ' " @entity156 contributed to this report			0

more than *500,000* people visited @entity51 last year , but that 's a *big* drop on previous years
