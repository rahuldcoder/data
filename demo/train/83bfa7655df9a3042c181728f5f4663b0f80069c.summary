-- this week 's @entity2 meeting could mark a turning point in the acidic relationship between @entity5 and the @entity6			1
will @entity6 president @entity7 shake the hand of newly elected @entity5 president @entity9 ? will the two presidents even hold a meeting ? those are key questions after @entity9 's " we must work together " opinion piece published by the @entity16 's website last week			1
his comments have sparked optimism on the streets of @entity5 's capital , where residents are hopeful as they take note of their new president 's unprecedented charm offensive pushing for better relations with @entity27			1
but the @entity5 president 's new approach has n't played as well in @entity30			1
the @entity31 reported sunday that @entity30 prime minister @entity32 is stepping up an effort to blunt @entity5 's diplomatic offensive , and plans to warn the @entity2 that overtures toward a nuclear deal could be a trap			1
@entity5 insists its nuclear program is for peaceful energy , but the @entity6 and others suspect it 's for atomic bombs			1
the dispute about why @entity5 is seeking nuclear capability has prompted international sanctions and escalated concerns about additional warfare in the @entity46			2
in his op - ed , @entity9 wrote that he wants " a constructive approach " between his country and the world , including about @entity5 's nuclear program			1
" we must work together to end the unhealthy rivalries and interferences that fuel violence and drive us apart , " @entity9 said			2
analysts are divided about @entity9 and his sincerity in addressing his country 's nuclear program			2
but there 's one thing all analysts agree on : the op - ed was a jumping off point for a very high - profile public relations push			0
and this week , @entity9 could take things a step further			2
analyst : @entity9 needs to strike a deal quickly in many ways , @entity9 's recent election is like @entity7 's in 2008 : @entity9 enjoys enormous political capital , offering an opportunity to renew @entity6 - @entity5 relations			1
@entity9 overcame hard - line conservatives by campaigning as a centrist and a reformer , using a " hope and prudence " slogan			2
to keep hard - liners at bay , @entity9 now must deliver something -- namely , economic relief as @entity5 strains under global sanctions -- or his critics will prevail as they did against @entity7 in 2009 when his own venture on @entity6 - @entity5 diplomacy foundered , one analyst said			1
" now the roles are reversed : @entity9 needs to strike a deal quickly , " said @entity91 , president of the @entity92 , who authored " a @entity93 : @entity7 's diplomacy with @entity5			1
" this week 's @entity97 meeting " could be quite decisive , " @entity91 said			0
" that 's going to be the moment where the two sides have to invest the political capital needed			0
otherwise it will go nowhere			0
it 's going to be costly politically to strike a deal			2
there 's going to be critics on both sides , " @entity91 said			0
" there is a need for a huge dose of political will to be injected into the process			0
" will the two presidents meet ? @entity7 delivered a speech tuesday at the @entity97 , and @entity9 is scheduled to as well			1
but it 's unclear whether the two presidents will meet			0
@entity116 , a @entity117 deputy national security adviser , said monday that no meeting has been scheduled with @entity9 for this week , but the @entity117 remains open to diplomacy that serves @entity6 interests			1
@entity121 , a senior fellow at the @entity122 , said @entity7 should n't meet with @entity9 during the @entity2 gathering , though shaking hands in a corridor would be appropriate			1
@entity121 says that 's because while @entity9 is @entity5 's president , he is not the country 's leader			1
ayatollah @entity130 is the supreme leader of @entity5			0
" they are not counterparts , they are not equal , " said @entity121 , who also supervised @entity6 policy in the @entity46 under former president @entity132			2
" so for the president to meet with him , i think confers too great a recognition on him			0
" @entity121 said @entity9 was a skilled political tactician when he was the country 's chief nuclear negotiator from 2003 to 2005			2
" remember this is the guy -- @entity9 -- who wrote several years ago with pride how he tied us up in negotiations while the nuclear program ( of @entity5 ) was going forward , " @entity121 said			1
" so we should approach this with skepticism			0
" asked monday whether the two presidents may just shake hands , @entity116 replied , " i do n't think anything will happen by happenstance on a relationship this important			0
" @entity117 weighs in the @entity7 administration has welcomed @entity9 's published column			1
" but the fact of the matter is actions are what are going to be determinative here , " @entity117 spokesman @entity156 said			0
" the @entity5 , for a number of years now , have been unwilling to live up to their obligations to the international community as it relates to their nuclear program			0
" the international community 's economic sanctions against @entity5 has " taken a significant toll on their economy and put pressure on them to come back to the bargaining table , " @entity156 said			2
he did acknowledge that @entity9 now enjoys a window of opportunity against his hard - line adversaries at home , but @entity5 must " demonstrate their seriousness of purpose " and show " their nuclear program is for exclusively peaceful means			1
" for now , @entity7 's schedule this week does n't contain any meetings with @entity9			1
asked if the @entity6 is willing to ease sanctions against @entity5 , @entity156 said such economic pressure " is what has brought the @entity5 to the table			1
" optimism in @entity190 on the streets of @entity5 's capital , many appear to be hopeful that their president 's overtures toward the @entity6 are a good sign			1
but they 're also realistic that 34 years of mistrust will not disappear overnight			0
" i am 99 % sure things will be better , " said @entity190 resident @entity198			0
" i can just feel it			0
" @entity201 said he wants sanctions to end			0
" i want to see better relations , " he said , " so we can live a little easier			0
" @entity205 was n't even born the last time @entity5 and the @entity6 had diplomatic relations			1
but now , he feels like there 's a chance for change			0
" i want to see mr. @entity9 and mr. @entity7 sit in front of each other and speak about life , " he said			1
at the @entity215 in the famous @entity216 , merchant @entity213 said he 's optimistic			0
" we believe that two nations -- @entity5 and @entity6 -- they realize that they need each other			2
they like each other , " he said			0
" and they feel that it 's the right time to get together and to start talking at least			0
" @entity0 's @entity227 in @entity190 , @entity228 in @entity27 and @entity229 in @entity230 contributed to this report .			2
