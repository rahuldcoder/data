@entity0 -- eight months ago , the international community stifled a snigger when @entity5 's hyped rocket launch ended with a fizzle			1
at the time , @entity7 surprised just about everyone by actually admitting its failure , a departure from previous efforts to project success at all costs			1
but this time , they 've succeeded			0
no one is laughing now			0
object seen in orbit after launch " the world is not falling apart , like some would say , but at the same time this is not a joke			2
there was a lot of pre-media coverage that said that @entity5 was not good at missile technology and were sort of ridiculing them , " said @entity22 , executive director of the @entity23 and a former adviser to the @entity26 government			1
" are we that much less secure right now ? " he asked			0
" marginally , but at the same time , this is something that we have to worry about			0
" what we know is that just before 10 a.m. local time , @entity5 launched the long - range @entity38 rocket carrying " the second version of satellite @entity41 " from the @entity42 in @entity43 in the country 's west			1
it soared over @entity47 , dropping debris into the sea off the @entity50 , the @entity51 and waters near the @entity53 , according to the @entity55 government , which slammed the launch as " unacceptable			2
" " the success of the launch -- which most analysts assume is a clandestine missile test -- brings @entity5 one step closer to demonstrating a viable and reliable long - range delivery vehicle for a nuclear warhead , " said @entity57 , lecturer in @entity58 and @entity59 at @entity60			1
" if the missile technology is mastered , the last technical hurdle remaining is miniaturization of a nuclear warhead that can be deployed on the @entity38 rocket			1
" @entity22 says that 's still some way off			0
" there 's still a lot of work that needs to be done if they 're actually going to mount a nuclear device or a weapon on a rocket , " he said			2
" the good news is we have a fair amount of time			0
the bad news is that if we 're not proactive , and if we do n't figure out a way to curtail @entity5 's actions , they 're going to continue to develop and learn more and over the long term we 're going to have to deal with it in a much more difficult situation , " he said			1

" we do n't know if the one in 2009 was a nuclear device rather than a weapon itself			2
they might need additional refinement and testing of a weaponised as well as a miniaturized version that can fit on a warhead , " said @entity106 , senior research fellow for @entity107 in the @entity108 at @entity109			2
" more concerning would be an explosion that used a uranium - based warhead because the plutonium program is largely capped			2
" we do n't think they have any more available plutonium but the uranium path is really wide open			0
so if they have a uranium - based explosion , that will cause a great deal of concern in the @entity26 and its allies that there is an uncapped nuclear weapons program , " he said			1
read more : @entity5 shouts ' look at me ' with rocket the missile that @entity5 fired wednesday appeared to be a four - stage rocket based on old @entity132 technology , much less advanced than the rockets being used across the border in @entity135 , said @entity136 , a former @entity137 engineer and the author of " @entity139			1
" " what the @entity5 have done is taken the technology the @entity142 developed 50 years ago and upgraded it a little bit and they 're trying to use that old technology to cause a splash in the international scene and to get paid attention to , " he said			1
it seems to have worked			0
international condemnation has been building since the launch , which came just days after @entity5 admitted that technical problems could cause a delay			1
multiple theories have been given for the launch 's timing , but most analysts agree that a combination of domestic and international pressures and priorities came into play			1
after the humiliation of the failed april launch , leader @entity163 was desperate to assert his leadership credentials , some analysts say			1
a rocket launch was also seen as a fitting tribute to mark the first anniversary of the death of his father , former leader @entity171			2
analysts have also pointed to the curious timing of the launch , which came just days before national elections in @entity55 and @entity177 , where the candidates ' stance on @entity5 is dominating debate in the final days of campaigning			1
@entity182 , a professor of international relations at @entity184 , says the launch was also designed to send a message to the @entity26 and @entity135			0
" @entity163 has told president @entity187 and @entity188 , ' i am not going to do business as usual			0
i 'll go down this particular path , come what may			0
' this sends a very negative signal and puts the @entity135 into a box			0
@entity188 must react either way			0
i believe that the @entity135 will be a lot stronger on @entity5 this time than on any other previous occasions , " he said			1
it 's not a view shared by @entity200 , research fellow in @entity201 and security affairs at @entity109			0
why did @entity5 launch a rocket ? " frankly , i do n't expect very much from @entity188 , " he said			1
" this new @entity135 leadership looks to be extraordinarily weak , in part because of the seven members of the @entity208			0
five of them will have to retire by 2017 , which means that the jockeying is already under way for the next succession			0
" he said the government is likely to take a " wait - and - see " attitude while the rest of the international community seeks to exert pressure on @entity5 through the @entity221 @entity220			1
" if @entity5 develops longer - range ballistic missiles , @entity135 does n't think that they 'll be aimed at @entity223			2
so from @entity135 's perspective , it has very little interest or need to come down very hard on @entity5 until the @entity26 , @entity55 and @entity177 make it clear to @entity135 that allowing @entity5 to do this is going to be more costly than cracking down on them , " @entity200 said			2
in a statement wednesday , @entity230 spokesman @entity229 expressed regret about the launch			0
" @entity135 has always insisted on bringing peace and stability to the @entity50 through multilateral dialogue			0
we hope relevant parties stay calm in order to maintain peace and stability on the @entity50 , " he said			0
@entity135 has traditionally been a stumbling block in efforts by the international community to pressure @entity5 with sanctions imposed through the @entity220 , @entity106 said			1
" when the @entity26 and @entity177 went to the @entity221 working group after the april launch with a proposed 40 additional entities , @entity135 rejected all but three , " he said			0
he added that the @entity26 's ability to convince @entity223 to back its efforts on @entity5 will be a real test of @entity26 ambassador to the @entity221 @entity255 and the @entity187 administration 's policy toward @entity135			1
timeline : @entity5 's rocket - fueled obsession			2

successful @entity5 launch is cause for concern , analysts say
the launch brings @entity7 closer to the capability to launch a nuclear warhead
there are fears the next step could be another nuclear test
*urgent* action is needed through the @entity220 , analysts say
