-- views on marijuana are shifting , but nearly everywhere , it is too early to talk about substantive changes to drug policies			0
the small @entity8 country is poised to become the first nation to legalize and regulate the production , sale and consumption of weed			1
this would place @entity6 at the vanguard of liberal drug policies , surpassing even @entity17 , where recreational drugs are illegal but a policy of tolerance is in place			2
the bill , which was passed by @entity6 's @entity23 and will be taken up by the @entity24 , attempts to answer the questions that inevitably arise when debating drug policy : how will marijuana be regulated ? who will grow it ? how can the country avoid cannabis tourism ? the @entity6 government offers specific proposals for how to manage a legal market for marijuana			1
the government supports the marijuana bill and says it was designed to resolve issues particular to @entity6			1
but the model the bill proposes will undoubtedly be studied by other countries that grapple with the similar questions			1
why @entity6 , why now ? there is a contradiction in @entity6 law , the secretary - general of the country 's @entity43 on drugs , said : consumption of marijuana has been legal , but its production and sale are not			1
" we seek to eliminate that incongruence , " @entity53 told @entity0			0
the other tenets of the marijuana bill are to treat the use of weed as a health issue and to make a distinction between dangerous drug traffickers and consumers			1
the same debates about marijuana that exist in the @entity66 -- about medicinal properties , recreational use , the impact on the justice system -- have been happening in @entity6 for a long time , @entity53 said			1
the decision to push legislation to overhaul its drug policies did not come overnight			0
" we have reflected on our problems , " @entity53 said , and the government felt that @entity6 's tradition of tolerance and equality merited action on the marijuana issue			1
president @entity83 's @entity82 coalition has a majority in the @entity24 , making passage of the marijuana bill likely when the chamber considers it in october			1
then , @entity88 has said , he will sign it into law			0
however , the progress that the bill has made is at odds with what polls say is the will of the people			2
according to a @entity100 poll in july , 63 % of @entity6 respondents said they disagreed with the bill			2
only 26 % said they approved			0
the poll , which surveyed more than 1,000 @entity6 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points , is not much different from earlier polls published when the bill was proposed			1
" the government does not overlook the polls and public opinion , " @entity53 said , but the government believes it is in the best interest of the country to go forward with the bill			1
it is not the executive branch , but the @entity118 that will pass the law , and voters will decide in the next elections whether to " punish " the ruling party for going against public sentiment , he said			2
the model the marijuana bill could be modified by the @entity24 , but as it is currently written , it provides several paths for the legal production and sale of marijuana , while increasing health education about the risks of drug abuse			1
in short , the proposed law states that the planting , cultivating , harvesting and selling of marijuana remain illegal but adds a long list of exceptions to that rule			2
households may grow up to six plants and harvest a maximum of 480 grams of weed per year			0
another avenue would be the creation of " membership clubs " made up of between 15 and 45 people , who can grow up to 99 marijuana plants			0
these growing operations must be licensed by the government , and the pot will be sold to the public through pharmacies , which also will be licensed to do so			0
those who grow or sell marijuana outside of these government - licensed options will be subject to prosecution and could face prison terms of 20 months to 10 years			0
the bill calls for the creation of a new government body -- the @entity162 -- that would be in charge of the licensing and any sanctions for noncompliance			0
the institute would also oversee a registry of all marijuana buyers that would be designed to ensure that those who buy marijuana are at least 18 years old and residents of @entity6			2
this requirement is also meant to deter cannabis tourism to the country			0
the bill also instructs the health system to provide educational programs about the risks of drug use at all levels of schooling			0
any direct or indirect advertising for marijuana in any media would be prohibited			0
a grand experiment the government studied drug policies in many countries where marijuana is decriminalized or tolerated , but the bill that has garnered international attention was not designed to be copied			1
it is tailored for the problems that @entity6 faces , @entity53 said			0
rising drug violence " has impacted daily life in our country , " and regulating the market could be a solution , he said			0
if it becomes law , the new marijuana regulation will put @entity6 at odds with many countries that continue to pursue an aggressive policy of prohibition			1
but conversations about rethinking marijuana laws have sprung up in @entity207 and elsewhere , and @entity6 is prepared to take any heat about its decision , @entity53 said .			2

@entity6 is close to legalizing and regulating marijuana
if the bill becomes law , it will allow the production and sale of weed
the proposal is specific for @entity6 , but the model will be of interest to other countries
the government is pushing for the bill , which polls show the public is against
