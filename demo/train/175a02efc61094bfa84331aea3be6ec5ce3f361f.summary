president @entity1 will meet with more than a dozen tech company bosses tuesday , one week after industry leaders asked the government to change its spying practices			1
the @entity6 meeting comes a day after a federal judge said the government 's collection of domestic phone records is unconstitutional			1
such practices were brought to light by former @entity15 contractor @entity13 , who leaked the classified information			1
@entity1 plans to sit down with @entity18 of @entity19 and @entity20 of @entity21 , as well as executives from @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 , sherpa @entity32 , @entity34 , @entity35 and @entity36 , a @entity6 official said			0
but national security and " unauthorized intelligence disclosures " are only part of the agenda			0
the meeting will also include talks about how the tech sector can help the government avoid it debacles like the healthcare.gov website rollout			1
@entity13 's open letter offers to help @entity48 investigate @entity15 surveillance the judge 's decision @entity54 district judge @entity53 's ruling came as the @entity1 administration completes a review of @entity15 surveillance in the aftermath of the @entity13 leaks			1
@entity53 said the @entity15 's bulk collection of metadata -- phone records of the time and numbers called without any disclosure of content -- apparently violates privacy rights			1
his preliminary ruling favored five plaintiffs challenging the practice , but @entity53 limited the decision only to their cases			2
" i can not imagine a more ' indiscriminate ' and ' arbitrary invasion ' than this systematic and high - tech collection and retention of personal data on virtually every citizen for purposes of querying and analyzing it without prior judicial approval , " said @entity53 , an appointee of president @entity72			2
" surely , such a program infringes on ' that degree of privacy ' that the @entity84 enshrined in the @entity85			0
" @entity53 's ruling said the " plaintiffs in this case have also shown a strong likelihood of success on the merits of a @entity85 claim , " adding " as such , they too have adequately demonstrated irreparable injury			2
" judge : @entity15 domestic phone data - mining unconstitutional but he put off enforcing his order barring the government from collecting the information , pending an appeal by the government			1
@entity53 rejected the government 's argument that a 1979 @entity105 case provided precedent for the constitutionality of collecting phone metadata , noting that public use of telephones had increased dramatically in the past three decades			2
@entity53 also noted that the government " does not cite a single instance in which analysis of the @entity15 's bulk metadata collection actually stopped an imminent attack , or otherwise aided the government in achieving any objective that was time - sensitive in nature			1
" @entity118 sen. @entity117 of @entity119 , a critic of the @entity15 data mining , called on @entity121 to pass legislation he proposed to " ensure the @entity15 focuses on terrorists and spies - and not innocent @entity54			1
" a @entity126 spokesman said monday that " we believe the program is constitutional as previous judges have found , " but said the ruling is being studied			0
the avalanche of information explosive revelations earlier this year by @entity13 triggered new debate about national security and privacy interests in the aftermath of the september 2001 terrorist attacks			2
@entity13 's revelations led to more public disclosure about the secretive legal process that sets in motion the government surveillance			1
in a statement distributed by journalist @entity145 , who first reported the leaks , @entity13 said he acted on the belief that the mass surveillance program would not withstand a constitutional challenge , and that @entity54 deserved a judicial review			2
" today , a secret program authorized by a secret court was , when exposed to the light of day , found to violate @entity54 ' rights			0
it is the first of many , " @entity13 said in the statement			2
he is living in @entity156 under a grant of asylum to avoid prosecution over the leaks in the @entity54			0
@entity145 said the judge 's ruling vindicates what @entity13 did			1
" i think it 's not only the right , but the duty of an @entity54 citizen in @entity13 's situation to come forward , at great risk to himself , and inform his fellow citizens about what it is their government is doing in the dark that is illegal , " the journalist told @entity177 's " @entity176 " monday night			1
@entity15 official : @entity13 amnesty ' worth having a conversation about ' secret court approval the case before @entity53 involved approval for surveillance in april by a judge at the @entity186 ( @entity186 ) , a secret body that handles individual requests for electronic surveillance for " foreign intelligence purposes			1
" under the @entity192 of the 1970s , the secret court was set up to grant certain types of government requests -- wiretapping , data analysis , and other monitoring of possible terrorists and spies operating in the @entity54			0
the @entity15 has admitted it received secret court approval to collect vast amounts of metadata from telecom giant @entity203 and leading internet companies , including @entity24 , @entity19 , @entity21 , @entity30 and @entity25			0
the @entity206 that @entity121 passed after the 9/11 attacks broadened the government 's ability to conduct anti-terrorism surveillance in the @entity54 and abroad , eventually including the metadata collection.in order to collect the information , the government has to demonstrate that it 's " relevant " to an international terrorism investigation			0
but the 1978 @entity192 law lays out exactly what the special court must decide : " a judge considering a petition to modify or set aside a nondisclosure order may grant such petition only if the judge finds that there is no reason to believe that disclosure may endanger the national security of the @entity54 , interfere with a criminal , counterterrorism , or counterintelligence investigation , interfere with diplomatic relations , or endanger the life or physical safety of any person			0
" in defending the program , @entity15 director gen. @entity234 told the @entity236 last week that " 15 separate judges of the @entity186 have held on 35 occasions that @entity239 ( of the @entity206 ) authorizes the collection of telephony metadata in bulk in support of counterterrorism investigations			0
" initially , telecommunications companies such as @entity203 , were the targets of legal action against @entity206 provisions			0
@entity121 later gave retroactive immunity to those private businesses			0
@entity203 turned over the metadata to the government			0
an array of legal challenges last month , the @entity255 refused to take up the issue when it denied a separate petition , which was filed by the @entity258			1
prior lawsuits against the broader @entity15 program also have been unsuccessful			0
days after the @entity13 disclosure in june , some @entity203 customers filed legal challenges in the @entity265 federal court			1
the left - leaning @entity266 also filed a separate , pending suit in @entity269 federal court .			0
