@entity1 was in a brutally reflective mood in the words he chose to describe his opening round in the @entity5 the world no.2 carded an eight - over - par round of 79 as the world 's golfing giants made their first forays on @entity13 's testing @entity12 course			1
all the golfers are contending with the rarities of a @entity17 heatwave but @entity1 said he was tortured by a long - term torpor			1
" sometimes i feel like i 'm walking around out there and i 'm unconscious , " said @entity1 , a two - time major winner , told the media			1
" i just need to try to think more			0
i 'm trying to focus and trying to concentrate			0
" but i ca n't really fathom it at the minute , and it 's hard to stand up here and tell you what 's really wrong " it 's just so brain dead			0
seriously , i feel like i 've been walking around out there like that for the last couple of months			0
i 'm trying to get out of it			0
" @entity1 lost his top ranking to @entity34 in march and the @entity36 golfer is still searching for his first win in 2013 , having only chosen to enter seven tournaments before the @entity5			1
the 24 - year - old 's slump in form has also been linked to his switch to @entity43 equipment this year in a deal reported to be worth $ 250m			2
@entity1 struggled to the turn at @entity12 in one over before two painful double - bogeys and four bogeys on the back nine left him searching for answers			1
a comeback of epic proportions is required if @entity1 can make the cut for the third major of the year			2
" i want to try to be here for the weekend , " @entity1 said			2
" but the thing that i need to do tomorrow is just go out there and freewheel it and try and make birdies and try and play with that little bit of whatever it is i have usually			0
" @entity1 faced questions about his dubious form on the eve of the @entity5 with suggestions his high - profile relationships with @entity67 tennis player @entity66 was a distraction			1
but he rebuffed that suggestion , saying : " no , not at all , no , no. it 's not that at all			0
no , i 'm fully focused on the golf out there			0
" @entity1 was n't the only golfer mired at @entity12 , where temperatures nudging 80 degrees @entity76 ) had hardened the course and sped up the greens			2
@entity80 winner @entity79 finished on four over par after carding a 75 which included just a single birdie on the 17th hole			1
fellow briton @entity85 , the world no. 9 , finished five shots further adrift of @entity88 after going round the links course in 80 while @entity91 masters champion @entity90 settled for a par - round of 71			1
@entity34 , on the hunt for his first major win since 2008 , was one over at the turn but clawed his way back into contention on the back nine			0
the 14 - time major winner lashed his opening tee - shot into the rough and ended up taking a penalty drop but four birdies - and just one bogey - on the run - in helped him finish on two - under			1
" there was n't a lot of talking out there because we 're trying to grind it out on that golf course , and it 's one of those courses where it just got so difficult , " @entity34 told reporters			0
" as the golf course dried out it got quick			0
some of these putts today , i mean , i putted the ball off the green today			0
and it really was n't that bad a putt			0
" eagle eye fellow @entity123 @entity122 , winner of the 2007 masters , held the overnight lead with a five - under 66			1
it was a punchy round from the 37 - year - old , who eagled the long par - five fifth and dropped just a single stroke at the 14th			1
" any time you shoot under par in an @entity5 or a major , for that matter , you have to be putting at least decent and i putted great , " @entity122 told reporters			1
the @entity123 holds a one - shot lead over 57 - year - old compatriot @entity137 and @entity139 's @entity138 , who both carded 67			1
@entity140 came a group of five players -- @entity123 @entity143 , @entity144 and @entity145 , @entity146 of @entity139 and @entity148 's @entity147 -- on three under			2
@entity123 teenager @entity149 , who beat @entity122 and @entity150 to the @entity152 title in a play - off earlier this month , joined @entity154 on two - under			1
that victory earned the 19 - year - old the last spot in the @entity5 and the debutant is in relaxed mood at @entity12			2
" it has been a great couple of weeks , " @entity149 said			0
" i 've kind of accomplished more than i 'd thought possible this year			0
" what would n't @entity1 give to be able to say the same thing ?			2

@entity1 shoots an eight - over - par round of 79 in first round of the @entity5
@entity36 's world @entity167 says he is " walking round unconscious "
