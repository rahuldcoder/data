@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity5 in @entity6 have momentum that makes any effort to negotiate with them difficult , the @entity4 defense secretary said			1
defense secretary @entity10 arrived in @entity11 , @entity12 , on monday			1
he 's visiting @entity6 on wednesday			2
secretary @entity10 spoke to @entity2 's @entity13 in an exclusive interview tuesday evening before leaving for @entity6 , where he is visiting troops and bases wednesday			1
" the political level of the @entity5 probably is n't ready to think about reconciliation or any kind of accommodation at this point , " @entity10 said in the interview			1
" they probably feel like they have the momentum with them			0
and until that momentum changes , it will be difficult			0
" as part of the @entity4 strategy in @entity6 , the military and @entity6 government are attempting to reach out to elements of the @entity5 who are engaged in the battle for financial gain , rather than ideological gain			1
" there are really two groups we 're talking about -- the younger , or less committed , who do this mainly to earn a living and put food on the table for their families , and those that are more ideologically committed			0
the latter are going to be a tougher pull , and we 'll probably have to wait awhile before there 's an opportunity there			0
" on monday , @entity2 's @entity53 interviewed a spokesman for the @entity5 , @entity55 , who said the @entity5 will only negotiate with the @entity6 government when the @entity4 leaves the country			1
" our conditions are clear , we want to negotiate and they [ the @entity4 ] will not interfere in our affairs ; secondly , they [ the @entity4 ] will leave the country , " @entity55 told @entity2			2
@entity10 said the stance was not surprising			2
" well i do n't know what else he 'd say			0
he 's leading the opposition , he 's leading this insurgency			0
he 's not going to sort of , sort of throw down and say ' we 're ready to negotiate , we 're about done here , ' " @entity10 said			1
the @entity4 is adding 21,000 troops to the @entity6 battlefield			1
the majority will be moving to the south to confront the @entity5 along the porous @entity71 border			0
the @entity5 have had mostly free rein in that area with few @entity4 or coalition forces to confront them until now			1
@entity10 admitted moving the battle to the south will mean there is " a tough fight ahead			2
" " i think , certainly , i have been pretty clear			0
as we move into areas of the south that have not seen any @entity6 or coalition forces so far , we 're clearly going to be going into areas where the @entity5 are very entrenched , " he said			1
" and , sad to say , i expect with the rising level of our activity and operations , there probably will be higher casualties			0
" in recent weeks , the @entity71 government has seen the @entity5 gain control on its side of the @entity6 - @entity71 border			1
privately , @entity71 officials have expressed concern to the @entity4 that the increased fighting in southern @entity6 will only push the @entity5 back to the @entity71 side			1
" well i think it 's just the reality that there are extremists on both sides of that border			0
and they threaten both the elected government of @entity6 and the elected government of @entity71			2
so like it or not , they both have a certain common enemy , " @entity10 said			0
@entity10 said he is encouraged by recent cooperation efforts between the two countries to deal with the problem , and by @entity71 's recent confrontation with the @entity5 in @entity114 province , near the capital of @entity116			2
" the signs right now are pretty positive , " he told @entity2 .			0
