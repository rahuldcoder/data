-- the @entity1 has settled its case with the state over the release of safety data for its embattled pediatric heart surgery program , which was closed last year following patient deaths			1
the dispute stems from a request last year by a local radio reporter for information about the program			0
the university declined to give that information , citing patient privacy laws , but then released it august 9 when a @entity0 investigation caused an uproar among parents of children with congenital heart disease			1
" we are pleased that the litigation has been resolved , " said university spokesman @entity21			0
" the university was not put in the position of having to disclose patient and family information that would violate either peer review or privacy laws -- both of which are protected by federal laws			2
" the @entity35 attorney general got involved in december when the university declined to provide the safety data requested by @entity38 , then a radio reporter for @entity40			1
the attorney general asked the university to make the information public , but the university declined , and sued @entity38 in order to keep it private			1
after the @entity0 report , the university revealed that the pediatric heart program had a higher mortality rate than the national average			2
the university still has n't released all the information @entity38 had asked for under the state 's open records law , but she issued a statement last week saying she had agreed to a dismissal of the case			2
" @entity1 's release of its mortality rates in the pediatric cardiothoracic surgery program has achieved in large part my purpose for filing the open records request , " wrote @entity38 , who now works in the @entity60 mayor 's office			1
" families who are entrusting their children to @entity69 now have access to this type of information			0
" among the pieces of information @entity38 asked for that still have not been released are documents relating to the evaluation and accreditation of the pediatric heart program and the date of the last surgery completed by the university 's chief heart surgeon , who has since resigned			1
" @entity88 is not required to disclose any documents , remaining mortality statistics ( which are protected by federal law ) , or any dates , " @entity83 , @entity1 general counsel , wrote to the board of trustees on august 16 , adding , " we could see further litigation involving other media outlets			2
" the university is planning to reopen its pediatric heart surgery program after conducting a review , which it anticipates will be completed in the next few weeks , according to @entity21 , the @entity1 spokesman			0
" when the review is completed , we will release as much of the final report as federal and state law allow , " he said , adding that the report will be " focused most intently on how best to move forward than as a retrospective examination			0
" @entity103 , whose infant son , @entity104 , went into heart failure after having surgery at @entity1 , said she 's concerned the university will keep crucial parts of the review a secret			0
" they 've used federal and state laws before when they did n't want to give statistics , so what 's to say they wo n't do that again ? " she said .			0
