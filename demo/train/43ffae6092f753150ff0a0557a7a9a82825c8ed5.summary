-- october 4 , 2010 download @entity2 maps related to today 's show : @entity4 @entity5 @entity6 , @entity7 transcript this is a @entity10			1
this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated			2
@entity14 , @entity15 : it 's the first full week of october , and we are ready to kick it off with 10 minutes of commercial - free headlines			1
hello and welcome ! you 've found your way to @entity0 ! first up : @entity4 @entity25 @entity26 : first up , a highly unusual travel alert from the @entity29 government			1
it 's telling @entity29 who are in @entity4 -- or who are going there -- to be on guard			1
the reason : intelligence that indicates the potential for a terrorist attack			2
this goes back to a story we told you about last week : concerns that @entity42 or another terrorist group might be planning some kind of attack in @entity4			1
the @entity29 government says it 's not telling people , " do n't to go to @entity4			1
" but if they do go , they should be careful while they 're there			2
for example , the travel alert recommends that @entity29 be cautious if they decide to ride public transportation or visit tourist sites like the @entity55 in @entity56 , @entity57			1
the alert also suggests that if @entity29 see anything suspicious or hear loud noises , they should move away as fast as they possibly can			1
flooding in @entity5 @entity26 : in the @entity29 , parts of the @entity62 are suffering from some severe flooding that hit the area over the weekend			1
some of the rain that caused the floods came from what was left over of @entity68			2
officials say at least 8 people were killed			2
@entity5 took some of the worst of the severe weather			2
roads were wiped out , businesses and houses were underwater			2
look at this ! you can see how high the water got , how it totally covered a street			2
in some spots , the water was even as high as the stop signs			2
in one @entity5 town , officials were trying to make sure that all the animals in the zoo got to higher ground			2
they evacuated most of the animals , but there were three water buffalo that had to be set free			2
those were found later on a hill nearby			1
@entity93 @entity26 : " one nation working together			2
" that was the theme of a rally in @entity97 on saturday			2
you can see some of the crowd gathered around at the @entity100			0
this rally was organized by the @entity93 movement			0
it 's a political movement with a lot of smaller groups all coming together for big events like this one			1
the @entity93 group says it 's pushing for things like better jobs and changes to @entity29 's immigration and education policies			1
it planned saturday 's rally to kind of show off its strength one month before this year 's mid-term elections			1
@entity118 @entity119 , @entity15 : it 's time for the shoutout ! how many justices are there on the @entity29 @entity124 ? if you think you know it , shout it out ! is it : a ) 5 , b ) 7 , c ) 9 or @entity131 ) 12 ? you 've got three seconds -- go ! the @entity124 has one chief justice and eight associate justices ; a total of nine			1
that 's your answer and that 's your shoutout ! new @entity138 @entity26 : all nine of those justices are back on the bench today as the @entity29 @entity124 kicks off a new session			1
this is the first session for @entity144 ; you might remember us covering her nomination several months ago			0
during a ceremony last friday , @entity144 was officially welcomed as the newest associate justice on the nation 's @entity150			1
the docket for this session , what the @entity124 will hear and rule on , has been more or less in place since february , though it can be added to after that			1
it includes some interesting cases			0
for example , is it legal to ban the sale of violent video games to anyone under 18 ? the court will also look at the issue of immigration and consider whether federal laws should overrule state laws			0
@entity169 @entity26 : something else starts this week : it 's @entity171			1
it happens every year from october 4th to the 10th			0
the @entity173 established @entity171 to help teach people about space exploration and to encourage support for space programs around the world			0
the @entity173 picked october 4th because it 's significant : it 's the anniversary of @entity181 ! on october 4th , 1957 , @entity182 became the first man - made satellite to be launched into space			1
in 2004 , on the same day -- october 4th -- @entity186 was awarded the @entity187 ; it was the first private , or non-governmental , manned space flight			0
what 's the word @entity192 , @entity15 : what 's the @entity191 ? no longer around ; vanished or non-existent @entity194 that 's the word ! back from the @entity196 @entity26 : well , you 've probably spent some time in your science classes learning about different kinds of animals that have gone extinct			1
@entity202 birds and dinosaurs are some of the more famous ones			0
but some scientists are warning people not to throw around that extinct label too quickly			0
the reason ? well , we 'll let @entity210 tell you about that ; he shows us some scientific examples of lost and found			1
( begin video ) @entity215 , @entity0 anchor : back from the dead ! a new study by the @entity219 says that more than a third of mammal species , like this okapi , once considered extinct or missing in the wild have eventually been rediscovered			0
though they thrive in zoos around the world , okapi are native to the @entity227 , where they were found in 2006 for the first time in fifty years			1
that 's a relatively short period though of " extinction , " especially compared to this massive fish called a coelacanth			1
experts thought it had died out with the dinosaurs before it was found swimming off the coast of @entity238 in 1938			1
from all corners of the animal kingdom , and the plant kingdom too , these species have defied declarations of extinction : a small frog in @entity238 , a short - necked beetle in @entity246 , rare flowers and ancient trees			1
all of these were once labeled lost to history and later turned up , alive and well			1
the study acknowledges a lot of effort is being wasted trying to find animals that are truly gone forever , like the @entity256 tiger , that died out more than 70 years ago			0
but perhaps the searching will pay off someday for other creatures that appear to have vanished , but perhaps are just waiting to be found again			1
@entity210 , @entity0 , @entity259			0
( @entity260 ) blazing trails @entity26 : high school on friday , college on saturday , the pros on sunday			0
if you have a friend or a relative who 's been spending weekends in front of the television , might be because it 's football season ! in @entity7 , two players are making a name for themselves under the friday night lights			1
that 's partly because of their names : @entity277 and @entity278			1
one school district , two schools , two different girls who are both playing varsity football			1
@entity283 of affiliate @entity284 tackles the story			0
( begin video ) @entity287 , @entity6 mills high junior , running back : it 's not about boys and girls , it 's just about the game and what we are out here doing			1
@entity297 , @entity284 4 reporter : a love of the game ; it 's what @entity302 senior @entity300 and @entity304 junior @entity303 have in common , first and foremost			1
but compared to their teammates , they 're quite different			0
the only girls in a boys ' game			0
@entity312 , @entity313 , defensive and offensive tackle : i 've always loved it , said i was gon na do it			0
@entity319 : for these ground - breakers , it took all kinds of guts just to get up the courage			0
@entity325 : i did n't know how the guys would take it			0
@entity319 : then to make it through two - a - days			0
@entity287 : it 's not as hard as people make it seem ; it 's really easy			1
you just have to try and put your best foot forward			0
@entity335 , @entity6 mills high coach : i 'm from the old - school , i guess you could say , and so having a female on the football team was not something i was looking forward to			1
@entity319 : both coaches had their reservations			0
special accommodations in equipment and locker rooms were made , but these girls proved their muscle			0
@entity349 , @entity313 high coach : she got in our off - season program , lifted weights , ran and got bigger and stronger			0
excuse me , she got stronger			0
i better not say that for @entity278			0
she got stronger , more agile			0
@entity319 : now , they 're just one of the guys			0
@entity358 , @entity313 , @entity360 's teammate : you have some times where you forget that she 's a girl and you just treat her like another football player			1
@entity319 : at least on the field			0
@entity277 's boyfriend is number 51			1
@entity287 : he 's proud of me and he supports me probably more than anyone else in my life except for my dad			1
@entity319 : like other new players , they do n't see a ton of game time			2
but they have a newfound notoriety , perhaps winning over a few of the skeptics			0
@entity379 : she 's fit in and i 'm proud of her			2
@entity319 : maybe blazing the trail for others to come			0
@entity325 : i think it 's just a time for us to change and say that we can do what we want to do just as well as anybody else			2
( @entity260 ) before we go @entity26 : all right ! before we go , we 're showing you pictures of a @entity392 festival that 's really full of hot air			2
in this case , that 's a good thing			2
fellow flyers flock from around the globe to @entity392 for nine days every year			0
when this thing started back in 1972 , 13 balloons -- that was it ! -- 13 balloons took off from a mall parking lot			0
now , there are so many balloons that they need a launch area that 's the size of 54 football fields ! goodbye @entity26 : we guess you could say the fiesta has ballooned out of control			1
but getting to watch all those things take off could really inflate someone 's spirits			2
time for us to go			0
man , we 're sorry			0
we 'll be popping back tomorrow to launch into another edition of @entity0			0
we 'll see you then .			0
