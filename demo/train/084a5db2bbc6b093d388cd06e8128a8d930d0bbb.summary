-- language experts weighed in thursday after poring over the nearly 2,700 words of president @entity5 's @entity4 speech on the @entity7 oil disaster			1
" it was straightforward and easy to understand , " said @entity8 , assistant professor at the @entity9 at the @entity10 , referring to the explanations of the crisis and its possible solutions			1
he divided the speech into 1,200 " idea units , " each of which represents a point the president was trying to make			2
he then looked at how many of those idea units contained jargon -- unexplained terms that the average person might not recognize -- and found none in the 65 idea units that explained the problem			1
of the 417 idea units that discussed what @entity5 planned to do , " i found only one idea unit that probably would be potentially confusing to a nonexpert			2
that was the term ' relief well			0
' he never explained that			0
" @entity36 is digging a relief well that is expected to intersect with the blown - out well in august			0
at that point , @entity36 plans to pump heavy drilling fluid into the runaway well , ending the flow			0
" if you look at the entire speech , and you look at the amount of jargon , it came out to 1.5 percent , " he said			2
ireporter : @entity5 's speech too fuzzy on details but @entity5 's speech may have gone over the heads of many in his audience , according to an analysis of the 18 - minute talk released wednesday by @entity57 , president of @entity58			1
tuesday night 's speech from the @entity4 of the @entity60 was written to a 9.8 grade level , said @entity57 , who gave @entity5 a " solid @entity62 " his @entity64 , @entity65 - based company analyzes and catalogues trends in word usage and word choice and their impact on culture			1
he singled out this sentence from @entity5 as unfortunate : " that is why just after the rig sank , i assembled a team of our nation 's best scientists and engineers to tackle this challenge -- a team led by dr. @entity81 , a @entity82 - winning physicist and our nation 's secretary of energy			0
" " a little less professorial , less academic and more ordinary , " @entity57 recommended			1
" that 's the type of phraseology that makes you [ appear ] aloof and out of touch			0
" @entity8 disagreed , supporting the quality of the president 's explanation for spelling out the efforts under way , even if they have not succeeded in ending the flow			0
" he 's just trying to be transparent , " @entity8 said			0
" we ca n't cure cancer , but i 'm comforted to know that the best researchers in the nation are devoted to finding a cure			0
" @entity57 found these three sentences insensitive : " already , this oil spill is the worst environmental disaster @entity106 has ever faced			1
and unlike an earthquake or a hurricane , it is not a single event that does its damage in a matter of minutes or days			0
the millions of gallons of oil that have spilled into the @entity7 are more like an epidemic , one that we will be fighting for months and even years			0
" " you should n't be saying that in katrina - land , " said @entity57 , referring to the 2005 hurricane that devastated the @entity120			1
" @entity121 lost a third of its population [ to evacuees who did not return ] ; it 's still recovering			0
" but he praised @entity5 's phrase " oil began spewing " as active and graphic			0
@entity5 's nearly 10th - grade - level rating was the highest of any of his major speeches and well above the grade 7.4 of his 2008 " yes , we can " victory speech , which many consider his best effort , @entity57 said			1
" the scores indicate that this was not @entity5 at his best , especially when attempting to make an emotional connection to the @entity106 people , " he added			2
though the president used slightly less than four sentences per paragraph , his 19.8 words per sentence " added some difficulty for his target audience , " @entity57 said			1
@entity144 , a linguist at the @entity145 , was unimpressed with @entity57 's criticism of the sentence length			1
" i think we can all agree that those are shockingly long professor - style sentences for a president to be using , especially in addressing the nation after a disaster , " @entity144 wrote on his blog			0
" why , they were almost as long as the ones that president @entity156 , that notorious pointy - headed intellectual , used in his 9/15/2005 speech to the nation about @entity159 , where i count 3,283 words in 140 sentences , for an average of 23.45 words per sentence ! and we all remember how upset the press corps got about the professorial character of that speech ! " @entity8 challenged the value of @entity57 's analysis			1
" there 's a tremendous amount of difference between analyzing the written word and interpreting the spoken word , " said @entity8 , a former science reporter who studies how to make complex topics understandable			1
@entity57 acknowledged thursday in a telephone interview that his analysis is indeed based on a written version of the speech , but said that does not necessarily render it invalid			1
" with the internet , probably as many people read the transcript as heard it , " he said			2
" to think it 's not read and analyzed by tens of thousands of bloggers is looking at the old model			0
" @entity8 countered that he does n't just count words and sentences , but instead measures the audience 's comprehension of news content			2
@entity144 said the " grade level " calculation had been debunked as " a mindless bit of math " that does not take into account the skill with which words were chosen or delivered			2
@entity8 , too , declined to rank the speech by grade level			0
" in my opinion , placing a ' grade level ' on 2,698 written words that are spoken ( with a variety of delivery aspects such as pauses , emphases ) does not accurately represent the importance of clear explanations about the key information presented in the speech , " he said in an e-mail			1
" in other words , i could confuse you with my introduction and conclusion , but if -- in the middle of my talk -- i specifically addressed and answered your concerns , then i have adequately communicated what you cared about			2

nearly 2,700 words with little jargon
people understand spoken and written word differently
