-- @entity1 has been banned from operating in @entity4 's strife - torn @entity2 , following official accusations the aid organization is biased towards the state 's persecuted @entity8 minority			1
the international medical ngo , also known as @entity1 , was last week banned from the southeast @entity12 nation , where it provides essential healthcare to tens of thousands of patients and has operated for 22 years			2
on saturday , the organization announced that the government had allowed it to resume operations in a number of regions , but not in @entity2 , where the majority of the predominantly @entity25 country 's disenfranchised @entity23 minority is concentrated			1
since 2012 , the state , home to an estimated 800,000 stateless @entity8 , has seen outbreaks of communal violence that have killed hundreds and left 140,000 displaced			2
in a statement , @entity1 said it was " deeply shocked by this unilateral decision			0
as the major ngo healthcare provider in @entity2 , it ran clinics in nine townships across the state , " treating anyone who was unable to access the medical care they required , " including tens of thousands of vulnerable people who displaced into camps by recurrent communal violence			2
but @entity43 , spokesman for @entity4 president @entity44 , said the organization had been banned from the state for consistently showing favoritism towards the @entity8 -- a stateless group @entity4 's government does not recognize as a legitimate ethnic minority , but regards instead as interlopers from neighboring @entity51			1
" @entity1 's foreign and local staff in @entity2 have created a lot of problems because they are not following their core principle of neutrality and impartiality , " he said			1
" when they give treatment to people they prefer to emphasize on the @entity64 people			0
sometimes rakhine people visit their clinic seeking help and they 're refused			0
they allow transportation of @entity64 patients to the nearby hospital but they fail to provide the same service to the @entity2 people			0

the @entity105 and human rights groups claim at least 40 @entity106 were killed by state security forces and ethnic @entity2 , with the @entity1 claiming it treated 22 people in the area for weapon wounds			1
but a government inquiry stated that only one police officer had died			0
@entity43 said the disagreement over the @entity103 massacre was " not a major issue , " but had been the " final straw " for the @entity2 state government when it came to the @entity10			2
" the state government and local people think the @entity1 is intentionally creating tension in the community by spreading baseless information like this , " he said			0
