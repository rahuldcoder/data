@entity0 -- summer 2013 was blurry for @entity3 , according to what the " @entity5 " singer told lawyers in april			1
" every day i woke up , i would take a @entity9 to start the day and then i would fill up a water bottle with vodka and drink it before and during my interviews , " @entity3 said in a deposition transcript made public monday			1
being high and drunk appears to be @entity3 's defense in a high - stakes lawsuit filed by @entity16 's family against @entity3 , producer @entity17 and hip - hop artist " @entity19 " @entity19 the lawsuit filed last fall contends @entity3 's " @entity5 " is an illegal rip - off of @entity24 's " @entity23			1
" " it is a musical impossibility , " he said in in the april 23 , 2014 deposition			0
" they 're two complete different syncopations and note choices and different keys			0
one 's a minor key and one 's a major key			0
" fans , journalists and music experts immediately recognized similarities between @entity24 's 1977 hit and the 2013 's summertime smash , @entity24 's heirs contend			1
@entity41 writer @entity40 wrote that the " @entity5 " bass line " came right from " @entity24 's song			1
musicologist @entity44 , an expert hired by the @entity24 family lawyers , said she identified a " constellation of at least eight substantially similar compositional features between the two works			1
... the signature phrase , vocal hook , backup vocal hook , their variations , and the keyboard and bass lines " are substantially similar and they share " departures from convention such as the unusual cowbell instrumentation , omission of guitar and use of male falsetto , " she said			0
if it was stolen , @entity3 was too high and drunk to do it , his testimony suggested			1
" i was high on vicodin and alcohol when i showed up at the studio , " @entity3 said			1
" i walked in and he [ @entity17 ] started singing me some ideas he had and the song happened very quickly , " he said			2
" i jumped right into the booth and started singing whatever he said			0
" @entity3 does claim creation of the melody and four - part harmonies in the second verse , but otherwise @entity17 " geniused the whole thing			1
" several print and video interviews @entity3 gave last summer tell a different story of @entity3 being thickly involved in creating writing and producing the hit			1
" @entity17 and i were in the studio making a couple records , and then on the third day , i told him i wanted to do something kinda like @entity16 's ' @entity23 , ' that kind of feel ' cause it 's one of my favorite songs of all time , " @entity3 told @entity86 for a story published in july			1
" so he started messing with some drums and then he started going ' hey , hey , hey ' and about an hour and a half later we had the whole record finished			0
" Ã‚ @entity3 now says he was lying to interviewers , partly blaming drugs and alcohol			2
" with all due respect , i was high and drunk every time i did an interview last year , " he said in the deposition			2
" so there are some quotes i do n't remember saying , but i do generally remember trying to sell the public on the fact that ' @entity5 ' was my idea in some way			1
" his lies were elaborations he " thought it would help sell records , " he said			0
" i thought that it being my song -- my idea would make it more personal because my music has always been so personal , that this was the first time i had a song out that was n't personal and had nothing to do with me , and yet it was my biggest successful , which , you know , was very tough for me			0
and so i lied in my story so i could at least make it seem like , hey , i 'm the guy who came up with this great idea			2
" @entity3 denied the lawsuit 's contention that he has a " @entity16 fixation			1
" " i 've been called ' the white @entity16 ' since i got started , " he said			2
" so i think i 've embraced that , consider it an honor			0
" @entity3 said that he was not drugged or drunk during the april deposition			2
in fact , he had been sober for the previous two months , he said			0
" i 've actually only been sober off the pills , off of @entity9 , " he later said			2
" " when your wife leaves you , it gives you good reason to sober up , " he said			0
@entity3 and his wife , @entity138 , publicly announced that they had separated in february			0
" sorry , " he told the lawyer			0
" that 's why i 'm starting to feel a little sad , because i had a tough year			0
" @entity3 has no idea what he 's doing @entity3 , who has a 20 % writing credit for " @entity5 , " said he did n't know how much money he 's made off the huge hit , since he let 's his business manager take care of his finances			1
" @entity5 " stayed at the top of @entity86 's pop chart for a record 16 weeks this summer and sold more than 6 million copies , according to court documents			2
@entity24 's heirs also accuse @entity3 of stealing from their father 's 1976 hit " after the dance " when he recorded " @entity157 " in 2011			1
those tunes " contain substantially similar compositional material in their choruses , including the melodies of their hooks , " the @entity24 filing contends			0
# @entity166 backfires big time on @entity3			0

@entity3 says @entity9 and vodka kept him high and drunk every day
@entity3 testifies he lied about creating " @entity5 "
" @entity5 " was @entity17 ' idea , not his , @entity3 says
@entity16 's family accuses @entity3 , others of ripping off a 1977 @entity24 hit
