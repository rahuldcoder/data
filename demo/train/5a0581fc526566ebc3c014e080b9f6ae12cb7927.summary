@entity0 -- @entity3 , a key leader of the @entity5 @entity4 , has been charged for his alleged involvement in the killings of seven @entity9 citizens at an @entity9 military base in @entity11 in 2009 , the @entity2 announced wednesday			1
a $ 5 million reward is being offered for information leading to the capture of @entity3 and another top @entity5 @entity4 leader , @entity16 , @entity9 officials announced			1
a complaint listed two criminal charges against @entity3			2
" we support any lawful means to hold this terrorist accountable for what he 's done , " @entity20 spokesman @entity19 said wednesday			0
" the announcement today is part of that			0
" a @entity9 official said the criminal charges are meant to deal with @entity3 if he 's captured , and added , " he can face justice in other ways , too			1
" the " in other ways " comment was a backhanded reference to @entity38 missile strikes in @entity5 , which have killed a number of suspected @entity41 terrorists and other extremists			2
the group -- which was declared a terrorist organization by the @entity9 -- is believed to be responsible for terrorist acts , including the december 30 , 2009 , suicide attack on a @entity20 base in @entity11 and the attempted @entity49 bombing earlier this year			1
a criminal complaint unsealed wednesday details the @entity9 government 's case against @entity3			1
all the victims were killed by a suicide bomber , a @entity55 national named @entity54 , at a @entity9 base near @entity57 , @entity11			1
the attack killed five @entity20 officers , two private military contractors working for the @entity20 , and a member of @entity55 intelligence			0
also killed was the base chief , @entity64 , a 45 - year - old mother of three			0
@entity9 officials believe @entity3 was working with @entity68 in planning the attack as well as planning the failed bombing attack in @entity49 in may			1
the counts against @entity3 include conspiracy to murder a @entity9 national while outside the @entity9 and conspiracy to use a weapon of mass destruction against a national of the @entity9 while outside the @entity9			2
@entity3 is believed to be the commander of @entity78 , which a @entity9 official described as a " @entity4 - inspired alliance of @entity5 - based @entity82 tribal militants			1
" the group claimed responsibility for the suicide bombing as well as the failed attempt to bomb @entity87 's @entity49			1
@entity89 investigators are piecing together their case based on interviews with survivors of the @entity11 attack and details gleaned by combing through personal items left behind by the victims			1
it is believed that @entity68 was working with @entity55 intelligence as a double agent , offering information to @entity55 and @entity9 intelligence officials on the aftermath of drone attacks while garnering enough support and trust to carry out the suicide attack			0
witnesses told investigators that @entity108 was welcomed on the base in december before he exited the right side of the vehicle , reached under his clothing and detonated the device he had strapped to his body			0
after the attack , a previously recorded video was released of @entity3 and @entity68 together talking about the attack			2
the @entity9 government listed the @entity5 @entity4 as a foreign terrorist organization , indicating its intent on going after terrorists one way or another			2
" we have no higher priority than bringing to justice terrorists who kill @entity9 serving and working abroad , " said @entity9 attorney @entity124 , jr. in a news release			0
" we will continue to use every tool at our disposal to seek justice for the victims of this heinous arrack			0
" complaints generally list the address of the accused			0
in this case , the accused 's address reads " @entity139 of @entity5			2
" and therein lies a problem			0
serving an arrest warrant against a suspected terrorist living in the tribal areas will be difficult			0
but the @entity9 has added a financial incentive by offering the $ 5 million reward for information leading to the capture of @entity3 and @entity16 , another leader of the group			1
