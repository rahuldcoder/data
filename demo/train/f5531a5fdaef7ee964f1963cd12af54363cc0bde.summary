@entity1 , @entity0 -- @entity4 nations have always played a major part in the world of football , and when it comes to the @entity9 they are considered among the main contenders every time			1
but this time around there may be a new threat from the continent making its mark internationally			0
@entity15 ( left ) celebrates his goal against @entity17 , tuesday , to keep @entity19 top in qualifying			2
out of 18 @entity9 to date , a @entity4 team has won the competition nine times , demonstrating that although @entity26 may be where the money is , the other side of the @entity25 has the raw talent			2
generally speaking , however , the continent 's dominance has been largely down to two countries : @entity33 , who have won the title an astonishing five times ; and @entity37 , who have made it to the tournament 's final match four times and taken the trophy home twice			2
the rest of the continent has rarely played a major part in the proceedings			0
now , though , as the qualifying stages for the 2010 @entity9 finals gather speed , the two giants are being put to shame by a footballing nation that has , until now , had very limited success at international events : @entity19			1
having only qualified for the finals seven times , and never made it further than the second round of the competition , @entity19 are n't usually seen as a serious threat to the big international teams , but this year the bookmakers may have to take a serious look at the small country from the center of the continent , with a population of just 6.1 million			0
following tuesday night 's 2 - 0 victory over @entity17 , @entity19 cemented their position at the top of the @entity4 qualifying group , with 17 points from eight matches -- four points clear of the faltering @entity37 and @entity33 , who share second place			1
so far in the group , the @entity79 have recorded a 2 - 0 home win over @entity33 and managed to secure a 1 - 1 draw away to the recent @entity84 champions @entity37 , proving they can keep up with the best in the world , even without one of their star players , striker @entity91 , who was injured for the @entity93 fixture			1
so , how are they managing it ? and can they continue this form through the qualifiers and into the finals themselves ? since 2006 , the team has undergone some radical changes			0
a lot of big names in the squad and behind the scenes left the team following @entity19 's relatively poor performance in the @entity9 in @entity109			1
so it was goodbye to the old , including @entity19 's most capped player , @entity111 and coach , @entity111 , who has been replaced by @entity114 @entity113			2
but this left the door open for a whole new face for the nation 's team			0
and the new breed of players clearly have a lot of skill , impressing people all over the world			0
players like @entity135 , for the @entity127 side @entity126 , and @entity128 , an integral part of the @entity131 squad in @entity133 's @entity132 , represent @entity19 's swelling talent in the major @entity26 leagues			1
the @entity79 presence in the world 's top leagues , shows the depth of their squad , and it also means players will be given the benefit of experiencing top level football on a regular basis ; something that can only aid the development of an already talented player			1
the style the team plays -- emphasizing a strength in attack , boosted by @entity135 and his gifted strike partners , @entity157 's @entity156 and @entity158 's @entity15 -- hints at a tactical change , as well			0
in the past , the @entity79 have relied heavily on a solid defense to secure results , and not always had the goals to back that up			0
now , although the defense is still strong -- featuring @entity167 regular @entity166 , and the powerful partnership of @entity169 and @entity170 -- there is some flair up front , which the manager is capitalizing on			0
so , with an influx of good players , who are getting the necessary top level experience and a manager who knows how to get the most out of his team , this may be an opportunity for a new country to step to the foreground from @entity4 and end the dominance of @entity33 and @entity37			1
as the table stands now , @entity19 are looking good to qualify , and if they can exercise the same level of skill they have shown in the opening eight matches , they could top the group and head to @entity192 as the team to watch in the finals .			2

in the past @entity33 and @entity37 have dominated @entity196
@entity19 are *challenging* , beating @entity33 and topping @entity9 qualifying group
the team has had a *reshape* since 2006 , many new , talented players
experience of playing in major leagues across the world helps player development
