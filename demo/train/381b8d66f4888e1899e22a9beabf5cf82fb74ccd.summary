-- imagine a star so luminous that it would burn the @entity8 up if it were anywhere near , a star that outshines the sun as much as the sun outshines the moon			1
a monster even in the abyss of space			0
the star is not some scientist 's celestial dream			2
astronomers used a @entity17 -- the instrument 's official name -- to detect the most massive star discovered to date			1
in scientific lingo , it 's a " hypergiant			0
" led by @entity25 , professor of astrophysics at @entity28 's @entity27 , the team of astronomers studied two young clusters of stars , @entity31 and rmc 136a			1
@entity33 , found in the @entity35 136a cluster , is 10 million times brighter than the sun and is the heaviest star ever found , @entity25 said wednesday , with a mass that is roughly 265 times more than the sun. it was born even heavier , with a solar mass of 320			1
astronomers previously thought 150 to be the upper limit			2
several of the stars studied had surface temperatures of 40,000 degrees , more than seven times hotter than the sun. @entity33 is rare and resides in another galaxy called the @entity47			1
its home is more than 165,000 light years away from @entity8 's @entity51 galaxy			0
as such , said @entity25 , it is not visible to the naked eye , nor with a rooftop telescope			0
" owing to the rarity of these monsters , i think it is unlikely that this new record will be broken any time soon , " @entity25 said			0
@entity25 's team used the sophisticated infrared equipment on the @entity17 in a @entity62 facility in @entity63 as well as data collected from the @entity65 to detect the colossal star			1
the telescope is considered the world 's " biggest eye on the sky " and is 8 meters ( 26 feet ) in diameter			0
the research was published in the current issue of the @entity75 scientific journal @entity76			0
" unlike people , these kind of stars are massive when they are babies , " @entity25 told @entity0			1
" they lose weight as they get older			1
" at over a million years old , the star is already middle - aged , @entity25 said , and could easily be a poster child for @entity85 , having shed a fifth of its initial mass over time because of powerful winds			2
in another million years -- a brief life span compared to the sun 's 5 billion years of existence -- the giant star will probably explode as a supernova			1
it wo n't be noticeable on @entity8 because it 's so far away			0
@entity25 , excited about the new find , had to find simple terminology to describe it to his 6 - year - old son @entity98			0
@entity98 , in turn , wanted dad to name the monster star after him			0
that might have sounded a whole lot better than @entity33 , but nonetheless , a star is born .			2

the newly detected star is 10 million times brighter than the sun
its birth weight was 320 times the sun
unlike humans , stars are born heavy and lose weight as they get older
