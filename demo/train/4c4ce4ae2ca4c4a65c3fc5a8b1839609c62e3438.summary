-- if you tirelessly rack up frequent - flier miles only to encounter snags when you try to redeem them , it 's time you discovered the increasingly generous world of hotel reward programs			1
@entity7 on both business and leisure travelers of late , hotel chains are doing whatever it takes to fill their beds			2
" this is an awfully good time to be using hotel points , " says @entity14 , publisher of @entity15 , a site that tracks loyalty programs			1
" you 'll save money , and you should n't have any problems getting a free night			0
" @entity21 knows full well how generous hotels can be			0
the retired mortgage banker and his wife , @entity24 , are n't paying a dime for 58 of the 61 nights they 've booked on an around - the - world trip starting in april			0
the couple piled up points with five different chains by using hotel - reward credit cards and signing up for all the giveaways they could find			1
( they even endured a 90 - minute time - share tour in @entity37 to earn 7,500 @entity39 points			1
) " it takes time to learn the system , and you 've got to keep your eyes open , " says @entity21 , who pens a blog on travel deals , @entity42			0
" but i rarely pay for a hotel room			2
" @entity0 : best value hotels stay ( almost ) any night many travelers have long harbored a big gripe when it comes to hotel loyalty programs : blackout dates			1
but those discouraging words may be a thing of the past			0
initially , @entity39 was the only chain that allowed rewards members to trade in points for a room on any night			1
but then @entity60 and @entity61 followed suit in the early 2000s , and two other biggies , @entity64 and @entity65 , relaxed their rules this past year			1
fantastic news , right ? unfortunately , there 's often a hitch : many chains still have what are known in hotel lingo as capacity controls , or curbs on the number of rooms available to loyalty club members during peak travel times			1
of the major players , only @entity64 and @entity39 claim not to have any capacity controls , while @entity65 , @entity60 , and @entity61 admit that some standard rooms are off - limits on popular nights , such as @entity84 at the @entity85 overlooking @entity86			1
one other alert : some chains require that you keep your account active every year by earning or redeeming points -- or your stash will disappear			2
have a hotel shopping spree a free room is n't the only thing your points buy -- @entity60 has @entity97 and @entity98 for sale at its online mall , @entity65 dangles rounds of golf at its links in @entity104 and @entity37 , and @entity64 hawks tickets to @entity107 tapings			1
not to be outdone , @entity39 last fall became the first chain to allow rewards members to directly exchange hotel points for airfare			1
for example , a round - trip ticket worth about $ 350 on any airline costs 25,000 points -- and there are no dreaded blackout dates or extra fees			1
another plus for loyalty members is the current bonanza of point bonuses			2
@entity39 recently showered guests at its @entity126 hotels with quadruple the points they 'd normally earn for a night , while @entity61 is bestowing between 2,000 and 20,000 extra points for stays of two to eight nights through the end of april			1
a great resource for finding these bonuses is the delightfully nerdy new web site @entity136 , which has a database of thousands of offers across the country , color - coded to show the best deals			0
finding the right match because every program is different -- and many can be mind - numbingly complex -- comparing them is tricky			0
for one , every chain has its own formula for calculating how points are earned			2
@entity65 doles out 10 points per dollar spent at most of its hotels , @entity39 awards two points per dollar , and @entity60 allots 2,000 points per visit at its main brand , no matter how long you stay			1
many chains also have partnerships with credit card companies , allowing you to amass points every time you make a charge			2
the cards are usually free for the first year , and hotels often give away as many as 25,000 points just for signing up			2
trading in your cache is another matter : each chain requires a different number of points for a room , depending on the grade of the property and the desirability of the location			2
you 'll spend 7,500 points for a night at a low - frills @entity65 ( such as a @entity178 ) or a whopping 20,000 points to live it up at the deluxe @entity181			0
to help you zero in on the program for you , we 've broken down exactly how much you have to spend in dollars to earn a free night at five of the biggest chains ( see the chart )			0
experts have their favorite programs			0
@entity188 , publisher of @entity189 , another web site that tracks loyalty clubs , likes @entity39 's cash - and - points option , which lets travelers use money to make up the difference when they do n't have enough points for a free stay			1
@entity21 is a fan of @entity60 's @entity199 promotions , which make rooms available for 5,000 points , half the normal rate			1
his best piece of advice : just dive in			0
" it does n't cost anything to sign up , so join all the programs			0
then stay poised for the deal with your name on it			0
