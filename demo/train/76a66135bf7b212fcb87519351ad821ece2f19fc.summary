-- the head of the nail -- @entity4 's new movie hits it hard and square			1
maybe too hard for those who appreciate a little ambiguity with their messaging , but ambiguity is not on the agenda in this tale of business ethics at the dark end of the street			2
adapting and updating @entity15 's 1974 crime novel " @entity16 " and resuming his collaboration with " @entity18 " producer / star @entity19 , @entity4 has crafted a poison pen letter to late capitalism in general and the @entity22 in particular			1
that sounds like a long reach for a thriller , but gangster films as different as " @entity27 " and " @entity28 " have cast a baleful eye on the @entity22 pursuit of happiness before			1
but even then , " @entity36 " never seemed so rotten to its core as in this caustic , corrosive piece of pulp nihilism			2
this is @entity38 , so wet it 's as if the floods never left			1
@entity41 and the dam have burst			2
the airwaves are clogged with economic meltdown			2
president @entity45 is trying to sell the bailout			2
@entity47 is trying to sell himself and a vision of community that 's wildly at odds with the dog - eat - dog world we see on screen			1
( the two presidents feature so strongly in the elaborate sound design they 're practically supporting characters			1
) @entity19 is @entity57 , one of those guys you go to with a job you do n't want to spell out			1
for $ 10,000 , he 'll resolve the problem			0
who are his employers ? it 's never specifically stated , but his contact , played with squirmy embarrassment by @entity67 , complains about the committee mentality , the squeamishness and the lack of leadership , so we know it 's the corporate mafia			1
gambling has been shut down in the city after a couple of lowlifes hit a big - money poker game knowing that the host , @entity78 ( @entity79 ) , will pay the price ( he 's foolishly admitted to jacking his own game once before )			1
@entity57 knows that @entity78 was n't involved this time -- no one is that dumb -- but recognizes that it makes no difference , he 'll have to pay before things can settle back to business as usual			0
meanwhile the real thieves -- pathetic scuzzballs looking to stake their own claim on the dream ( @entity93 and @entity94 ) -- soon spill their secret , and @entity57 calls in a colleague from out of state to dispatch the guy who put them up to it			0
he does n't want to do this one himself , he knows the guy			0
" have you ever killed someone ? it gets touchy - feely			0
they cry for their mothers			0
i like to kill them softly			0
" the plotting is as remorseless as @entity57 's logic , but the movie has an unusual and distinctive structure , one that comes straight from @entity119 , the @entity121 lawyer best known for " @entity122 " ( filmed with @entity123 the year before " @entity16 " was published )			1
@entity119 let his stories seep out from eavesdropped conversations , almost between the lines , putting the reader in the position of a juror trying to untangle a case from dozens of competing testimonies			0
in " @entity136 , " action scenes are doled out almost as counterpoint , tense but self - contained exclamations of aestheticized blood - letting			0
the movie 's real meat -- its heart and soul , if it has any -- lies in its coursing torrent of words ; a filthy tirade of crude , funny , deeply cynical man talk ( there 's one female speaking part in the movie , and she 's a hooker )			1
the men speak at each other			0
they 're all incontinent storytellers , bragging , justifying , hustling , cajoling , complaining , but only dimly comprehending			0
there 's an echo of @entity155 here -- and @entity157 before him -- but there are no pop culture references in @entity119			1
the speechifying is n't flip , cool or ironic , even if it does encourage displays of actorly machismo ( closer to @entity163 , in fact )			0
in the movie 's superb , sour centerpiece , there are two lengthy conversations -- monologues , almost -- featuring @entity170 as a bloated , alcoholic , bitter and defeated killer			1
he 's an aging hit man gone to seed facing a third long spell in jail and no one there at home when he comes out again			2
@entity170 is brutal in this role , all his tenderness turned vicious and repulsive through self - pity			1
but still , at least we discern the ashes of emotion in this wreck of a man			0
discreetly , not unkindly , @entity57 arranges for his removal and takes over the contract			2
@entity57 is the consummate professional , the hero by default in a movie without heroics , a savagely cynical satire on a bankrupt system in terminal decline .			0

the film is based on @entity15 's 1974 crime novel " @entity16 "
