@entity0 -- a convicted rapist seeking to prove his innocence with a new dna test lost his appeal thursday at the @entity6			0
the @entity8 @entity6 case involved a crime in which post-conviction dna testing was available			1
the justices ruled 5 - 4 that inmates can not use a federal civil rights law to press for advanced dna testing that was unavailable at the time of the crime			1
forty - four states and the federal government have laws allowing post-conviction access to biological evidence for such testing , but that number does not include @entity24 , where @entity25 was sentenced 15 years ago for a vicious attack on an @entity28 woman			1
" he has no constitutional right to obtain post-conviction access to the state 's evidence for dna testing , " chief justice @entity29 wrote for the majority			1
he was supported by his conservative colleagues justices @entity37 , @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity41			0
in dissent , justice @entity42 said , " there is no reason to deny access to the evidence and there are many reasons to provide it , not the least of which is a fundamental concern in ensuring that justice has been done in this case			2
" justices @entity55 , @entity57 and @entity58 backed his conclusions			0
@entity25 's trial attorney in @entity28 made a strategic decision 16 years ago to forgo more sophisticated dna testing of the evidence in the criminal assault case , believing it might end up working against her client			1
several years later , the @entity24 inmate sought access to the state 's biological evidence to have a state - of - the - art dna test done			1
although the court was ruling on the specific facts of @entity25 's case , the implications could be felt across the country			2
the high court refused calls to provide an automatic constitutional right to post-conviction dna testing for older crimes in which biological evidence is available for such testing			1
some states had feared a flood of frivolous lawsuits clogging the courts from prisoners whose guilt has already been established , a fact @entity29 noted in his opinion			0
the @entity94 , representing @entity25 , said dna testing has exonerated 232 wrongly convicted people in the past two decades			1
that includes 17 men on death row			0
@entity24 officials told the justices that even if more sophisticated genetic testing did not show the semen and hair at the crime scene matched @entity25 , other evidence remains strong enough to uphold the conviction			1
and they said that since there was no trial error , @entity25 should have made his claim of right to access to biological evidence at the trial , not on appeal			1
@entity25 was found guilty in 1993 of kidnapping and assault			2
he and a co-defendant were convicted of raping an @entity28 prostitute , then beating her with an ax handle , shooting her in the head , and dumping her in a snowbank near the airport , believing she was dead			0
the victim survived and identified @entity25 from photo lineups			2
he was sentenced to 26 years behind bars , with five years suspended			2
his co-defendant has continued to implicate @entity25 , and the 37 - year - old prisoner admitted his guilt in a 2004 parole hearing , although he later said he had made the confession only in the hope it would secure his release			2
he was not granted parole at that time , but was in 2007			0
initial state forensic testing on a condom and hairs found at the crime scene found the dna consistent with @entity25 's genetic profile , but that one in six -- or about 15 percent -- of african - americans like @entity25 might share a similar genetic profile			1
@entity25 's appointed trial counsel declined more sophisticated , independent testing , believing the initial one - in - six ratio represented " very good numbers " to make a case for mistaken identity , according to an affidavit submitted in the high court appeal			1
the trial lawyer was also worried that further testing could work against @entity25			1
a federal appeals court ruled in favor of @entity25 , saying @entity24 was trying to " foreclose " his possible innocence " by its simple refusal to open the evidence locker			1
" @entity25 's legal team said that under a section of the @entity159 , he has a right to such evidence in the government 's possession when making a " free - standing " claim of innocence			1
the high court had never before decided what role @entity138 can play in post-conviction appeals , despite a variety of testing that has been around for more than two decades			0
@entity29 noted that states are " actively confronting " how to handle evolving dna technology and increasing challenges by inmates			2
" to suddenly constitutionalize this area would short - circuit what looks to be a prompt and considered legislative response , " he wrote			0
he said having courts take over this issue now would be wrong			0
" we are reluctant to enlist the federal judiciary in creating a new constitutional code of rules for handling @entity138			0
" the majority found that @entity24 's procedures are adequate			0
but @entity55 said the state " has demonstrated a combination of inattentiveness and intransigence in applying those conditions that add up to procedural unfairness that violates the [ @entity193 's ] due process clause			0
" within months after @entity25 was paroled , he was re-arrested and then convicted of kidnapping and assault in a home invasion in @entity28			0
he is awaiting sentencing on those counts			0
the @entity6 case is @entity202 's @entity201 v. @entity25 ( 08 - 6 ) .			0
