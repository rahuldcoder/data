-- more than 4.3 million people tuned in to watch the @entity3 women 's soccer team beat @entity4 in a 2 - 1 victory in the gold medal olympic game			1
@entity7 was just happy to be on the field			1
after injuring her hamstring , @entity7 was sidelined for the team 's earlier game against @entity12			1
it was heartbreaking for the athlete to sit on the bench after all the health problems she had already battled during her journey to @entity19			2
@entity7 was diagnosed with lupus in 2007 when she was 30 years old			1
at the time she was playing for the @entity22 and had begun feeling extremely fatigued ; regular training sessions left her with joint pain and muscle soreness			1
she went public with her lupus diagnosis in april 2012 and is now working with the @entity27 to create awareness about this chronic autoimmune disease that affects 1.5 million people in the @entity3 with lupus , @entity7 's body produces auto - antibodies that attack and destroy healthy tissue because her immune system ca n't tell the difference			1
the auto - antibodies cause inflammation that leads to pain			2
symptoms can flare up at any time , and although the disease is somewhat controlled with medication , it is a lifelong problem			0
we caught up with @entity7 after the @entity44 to talk about her diagnosis and how she deals with it as an elite athlete			1
the following is an edited version of that interview : you have lupus , in addition to @entity53 -- another autoimmune disease			1
how do the two conditions affect you ? lupus is a chronic inflammatory disease that affects various parts of my body like my skin , my joints and various organs			2
( one symptom of lupus is the so - called " butterfly rash , " across a person 's cheeks and nose -- similar to the shape of a butterfly			1
) @entity53 is an autoimmune in which your body attacks your moisture - producing glands			1
i deal with fatigue and joint pain just like with lupus , but it also affects my skin , my eyes and my mouth			1
i have to regularly use eye drops , drink lots of water and get regular checkups for both my eyes and my teeth			0
keeping my inflammation down throughout my body is my biggest concern			0
@entity91 attacking my kidneys , @entity90 says how has having an autoimmune disease affected your job ? as an elite athlete , it is my job to maintain a high fitness level , as well as sustain a strong mentality			2
now add in a disease where my main symptoms are extreme fatigue and joint pain , and that standard becomes a little bit more difficult to maintain			1
i am very fortunate that i have finally found a medicine that helps control my symptoms , but a few years ago that was n't the case			0
i remember in 2010 going to training sessions completely exhausted and my knees throbbing from all my joint pain			1
i remember willing myself through those training sessions and then getting home and lying on the couch the rest of the day			0
mentally , i was exhausted because i was trying to figure out the right medicines to use ; i was dealing with side effects from those medicines and i was keeping it a secret from my teammates			0
on the positive side , it has made me so much stronger as a person and as an athlete			0
i have the mentality that this disease is not going to beat me			0
i may have a bad day , but it wo n't stop me from trying again the next day			0
how do you control your symptoms ? the medicine i am on now helps control the amount of " flare - ups " i may have , as well as control the amount of inflammation in my body			0
to help with joint pain , i wear compression pants to sleep in and i have also been able to tweak our lifting routine so that i do n't have to put as much pressure on my joints			1
i do less @entity145 lifts and more body - weight exercises			1
fatigue is probably the hardest one to control because you do n't know when it 's going to hit you			1
the best solution for me is , if i start to feel more fatigued than normal , i will train lighter that day or even just take it off completely			0
learning to live with lupus what do you eat on a regular basis ? i do n't have a specific diet			2
as much as i am training , my goal is to just make sure i 'm getting enough food			0
i do my best to eat a balanced diet , but as of right now it is n't any different than the rest of my teammates			0
what advice do you have for our readers who are dealing with lupus and / or @entity53 ? i understand that people with lupus and / or @entity171 's range from mild to severe and no two people are alike in their struggle with either of these diseases			1
i believe it 's very important to have a support system -- friends , family , the @entity91 foundation and the @entity171 's foundation -- that understands what you are going through			2
i think it 's important that you have someone who understands that you can feel good a majority of the time but are there for you when a flare - up happens			2
i also believe it 's important to stay active , whatever level of activity feels comfortable to you			2
i hope this is where i have inspired people			0
i have n't let this disease stop me from doing the sport that i love			0
you 've just begun to talk publicly about your battles with autoimmune disease			2
why did you decide to start sharing your story ? i kept my story a secret for a long time because i did n't want anyone to use it against me in my profession			0
as i am nearing the tail end of my career , i have realized it is a lot more important to use my voice to help bring awareness to lupus and @entity171 's			1
it takes people an average of seven years to be diagnosed , and in that time period they could be doing more damage to their body			0
if i can help spread the word about what lupus or @entity171 's is and what the symptoms are , maybe i can help get people in to visit a doctor sooner			1
dealing with an injury during the @entity145 is something every athlete fears			1
how do you weigh the benefits of rest / recovery over pushing through the pain to help your team ? good question			1
all of these thoughts went through my head when i felt my hamstring go 15 minutes into my first game in the @entity145			1
in a matter of seconds , i had to weigh both options			0
do i push through and maybe do more damage to my leg and maybe hurt the team in the process , ' cause i 'm not 100 % ( and in the worst case scenario , be out for the rest of the tournament ) : or do i take myself out and give our team the chance with a healthy body in there ? i chose the second , and even though it was hard sitting on the bench i knew i put the team first			2
i worked hard every day to get back as healthy as i could so i could be available if needed during the playoff rounds			0
it seems everything worked out in the end			0
my hamstring healed and i was able to start in the final game and help my team to an @entity263			2
not a bad way to the end the tournament			0
how becoming a patient can make you stronger			0
