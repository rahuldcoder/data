@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 has lived all his adult life without his right hand			1
he was only 15 when rebels of the @entity7 swept through @entity0 , the capital of @entity1			1
in their signature , sinister style , they hacked off @entity3 's hand with a machete			2
@entity3 , now 28 and a goalkeeper for @entity1 's amputee football ( soccer ) team , was one of thousands of victims who felt huge relief thursday after an international tribunal convicted former @entity21 president @entity20 on 11 counts of aiding and abetting the rebels to carry out war crimes			1
@entity20 convicted in the @entity25 " i think this should send out a very big message to those who want to commit crimes , " @entity3 said			1
" people will listen , even if they do n't care , and they will know what has happened today is important for us victims			2
" those who suffered in @entity1 's notoriously brutal civil war reveled in the fact that @entity20 was finally held to justice for the bloodshed , an act of accountability that had seemed implausible to many			1
in the diamond - mining region of @entity42 , where much of the atrocities took place , almost everyone has a story to tell about the rebels , who the @entity47 concluded were supported militarily by @entity20			1
" things went bad , but this will let people know that it will not go unpunished , " said the rev. @entity48 , head of the @entity49 in @entity42			2
@entity48 saw loved ones die , children abducted , women raped and homes burned			2
" my experience was very bitter			2
i lost everything in a heartbeat , " he said			2
the verdict , he said , will help heal the wounds			2
or at least begin healing			0
the court found @entity20 guilty of abetting murder , rape , conscripting child soldiers , sexual slavery and mining diamonds to pay for guns in the decade - long war that ultimately left 50,000 dead or missing			1
who is @entity20 ? it has been another decade since @entity1 emerged from violence			1
but another @entity42 resident was still too afraid to speak openly			0
he had seen hell and lives in fear of retribution for telling the world about it			0
during the worst of the war , he and his family walked by the cover of night to escape across the @entity87 border			2
but the rebels caught them and lined them up with others for execution			0
one of the rebel fighters recognized the man and called him out			0
he asked his son to point to all those he knew			0
the boy picked out his father , mother , sister and grandfather			0
everyone else was shot to death			0
" they killed them in front of our faces			0
my boy was so terrified -- he was only 5			0
" thursday , the man watched a judge read out @entity20 's verdict on a television screen in a bank			1
he stood among amputees and ex-combatants			0
they felt vindicated : @entity20 , they said , had robbed them of their youth and education			1
they might have been something in life had it not been for him			0
justice took a long time coming , the @entity42 resident said			0
" now i am waiting to see what will be the sentence , " he said			0
" will it be a life sentence ? we live with the bitterness of war			2
we can see scars all over			0
" opinion : who really benefits from these trials ? in @entity20 's homeland , @entity21 , the reaction to the court 's historic ruling was mixed			1
@entity20 had just become the first former head of state to be convicted by a war crimes tribunal since the @entity148 after @entity149 in @entity151 , the @entity21 capital , a man sported a " not guilty " t - shirt and advocated for @entity20 's freedom			1
others said they want their president back			0
" if i want him to come back ? yes			0
i would be happy , " said @entity158			0
" i 'm a @entity159			0
i do n't have any bad mind against him			0
" @entity162 said he was angry about the bad reputation the world has attached to @entity21			1
he said the people of @entity1 were hardly innocent			1
" we did not chop our people 's arms during our war			2
we are not ... wicked enough to chop up people , " he said			0
" we expect that our war crimes court , the court of @entity21 , will come here , too , to try people from @entity1			1
" added @entity173 : " i feel there was an international conspiracy			1
president @entity20 never ... went to fight in @entity1			1
" but not every @entity21 was defending @entity20			1
" i feel good for @entity20 to be guilty , " said @entity177 , " because he killed my people , he destroyed this country , so i do n't like him			1
i want they should ( put ) him in jail for life imprisonment			0
" back in @entity0 , people gathered at the @entity47 thursday to watch the verdict			0
@entity20 's proceedings were moved to the @entity187 because of fear that the trial might trigger instability in @entity21			1
how ' blood diamonds ' fuel conflicts in @entity0 , @entity20 still has a following			1
" the court says it is trying those who are most responsible , " said @entity194 , head of the @entity7 and the former spokesman for the rebels			0
" @entity199 took part in the war			2
in one way or another , they did take part in the war , " he said			2
" so if you would like to bring everyone to justice , i do n't know when the case will end			0
" for @entity214 , the amputee footballer , there is no end , either			1
and not for other victims of the war , who said that the conviction of one man was not enough to help get the damaged lives of thousands of others back on track			1
" i think more has to be done for the things that happened to us not to happen again , like amputation , rape , burning of houses , " @entity3 said			0
in @entity1 , said aid worker @entity228 , there are bullet holes in all the buildings			1
and there are bullet holes in the national psyche			0
in that sense , the verdict was a big victory , said @entity238 , @entity239 's director in @entity1			1
change is slow , she said			0
but with @entity20 likely to go to jail , the victims of his war know now that they do n't have to be mired in the past			1
journalist @entity247 reported from @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 's @entity248 reported from @entity249			1
journalist @entity250 contributed to this report from @entity151 , @entity21 .			2

an international tribunal finds @entity20 guilty of aiding war crimes
in @entity1 , war victims feel relief
@entity214 says much more has to be done for those who suffered
@entity20 finds some support in his homeland , @entity21
