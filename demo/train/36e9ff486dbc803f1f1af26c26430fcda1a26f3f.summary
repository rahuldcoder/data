-- every july in the lush , green mountains of @entity7 , @entity8 , many of the top present and former @entity4 national security officials and other experts gather to discuss how the war against @entity11 and its allies is going			1
ahead of last year 's @entity7 conference , i wrote a piece for @entity0 provocatively titled " time to declare victory : @entity11 is defeated			1
" and i then spoke on a panel at @entity7 where i tried to make the case for this position			0
i 'm not sure too many of the folks in @entity7 were convinced			0
( if they had been , it would hardly seem necessary to travel back to @entity7 again this year ! ) since last year 's @entity7 conference , a group of men only very loosely aligned with @entity11 attacked the @entity4 @entity25 in @entity26 , @entity27 , killing four @entity4 diplomats and @entity30 contractors			1
and in april , the @entity34 brothers whose family originated in the @entity35 -- one an @entity4 citizen and the other a @entity4 resident -- were accused of detonating pressure - cooker bombs in @entity39 that were based on a design that @entity11 's @entity42 affiliate had widely distributed on the @entity43			1
the bombing killed three and wounded more than 250 and brought ordinary life to a screeching halt in one of the nation 's largest cities			2
certainly the attacks in @entity27 and @entity39 were victories for " @entity52 , " the ideological movement that @entity11 has spawned			1
indeed , the @entity56 - born cleric @entity55 who was a leader of @entity11 's @entity42 affiliate before he was killed in a @entity4 drone strike in 2011 , was influential not only on the @entity34 brothers who possessed some of his writings but also on 22 other @entity4 - based jihadist extremists , according to a count by the @entity62			1
however , the attacks in @entity27 and @entity39 do n't really change the prognosis that @entity11 , the organization that attacked the @entity4 on 9/11 , is going the way of the @entity66 tape			1
@entity11 itself has n't carried out a successful attack in the @entity69 since the suicide bombings in @entity71 in 2005 that killed 52			1
and the terrorist group has n't carried out an attack in the @entity4 since 9/11			2
nor have any of its affiliated groups			0
the killings of several high - level @entity11 militants -- foremost among them the organization 's founder and leader , @entity79 , during a @entity81 raid on his compound in may 2011 -- have dealt a serious blow to @entity11 's core leadership			1
a few months after @entity79 's death , a @entity4 drone strike killed @entity89 , who had become @entity11 's no. 2 commander after @entity91 had assumed @entity79 's leadership role			1
@entity89 was one of 30 leaders of @entity11 in @entity94 who have been killed in @entity30 drone strikes over the past five years , according to a count by the @entity62			1
@entity11 " @entity97 , " in short , remains on life support			1
a second chance with the @entity100 however , the unrest that swept the @entity103 world in the wake of the 2011 @entity100 has provided jihadist extremist groups with more room to operate and injected large amounts of arms into the region			0
@entity11 affiliates subsequently gained significant footholds in @entity27 , @entity112 , @entity42 and @entity113			1
but the bulk of jihadist violence in those countries is focused on purely domestic targets			0
and in countries such as @entity113 and @entity42 , jihadist militants have overplayed their hands and have suffered real reverses in the past year or so			0
as a result , the attacks by @entity11 - aligned groups on the @entity4 @entity25 in @entity26 in september and on the @entity125 gas facility in @entity126 , at the beginning of this year represent the current state of jihadist anti-western capabilities abroad			1
worldwide , @entity11 affiliates and allied groups are n't a major threat to the @entity69 : -- @entity134 remains a real threat to @entity42 , but despite its strong interest in @entity4 targets , the group has not attempted any serious @entity140 attack since its failed october 2010 plot to plant bombs hidden in printer cartridges on cargo planes destined for the @entity4			1
however , @entity134 's capable chief bomb maker , @entity146 , remains at large			0
-- a long - term safe haven for the @entity11 affiliate in @entity112 known as @entity149 , ( " the @entity150 " ) could create an organization with the capability to attack the @entity69			1
for the moment , the group , which is widely regarded as the most effective fighting force in @entity112 , is focused on overthrowing the regime of @entity156 , a project that may take years to achieve			0
that said , this group is gaining substantial territory in @entity112 ; is attracting thousands of foreign fighters , including hundreds from the @entity69 ; and might eventually turn its attention to @entity163 targets			2
-- @entity11 in @entity164 has also become deeply involved in the civil war in @entity112			2
it has also successfully leveraged a growing sectarian divide in @entity164 to garner support from the @entity169 community and is , once again , a real threat to the stability of @entity164			2
-- @entity172 and its splinter groups have little ability to target the @entity69 but still pose a threat to @entity163 interests in their areas of operation			1
@entity172 and its splinter groups remain active in parts of @entity126 , where they attacked the @entity125 gas facility in early 2013 , and northern @entity113 , where they launched an offensive against the government alongside separatist @entity187 rebels in 2012			0
however , @entity172 and its splinter groups were pushed out of major @entity113 cities by a @entity190 military intervention earlier this year -- in the past two years , the @entity192 affiliate , @entity191 , has lost substantial territory and influence in @entity195			0
while @entity191 remains a potential threat to @entity163 targets because of the group 's influence among the @entity195 diaspora in the @entity69 , recent battlefield defeats have forced the group to focus internally			1
@entity191 has never conducted a successful attack in the @entity69 and has not conducted a mass - casualty attack outside of @entity195 since it carried out bombings in @entity206 , @entity207 , in 2010			2
-- @entity209 militant groups remain a threat to stability in @entity27 in the @entity213 era			0
@entity134 's loose network of @entity209 militants have conducted attacks and gained some legitimacy among the local populace in @entity26			2
@entity134 is not , however , organizationally or operationally linked to @entity11 , and it operates only within @entity27			2
-- the @entity94 @entity219 , also known as @entity220 , is largely a threat to @entity94 , @entity222 , @entity224 soldiers and @entity163 interests in the @entity222 - @entity94 region			0
it has attempted only two attacks outside the region			0
@entity220 has not conducted an attack on @entity4 soil since it directed @entity231 to carry out a car bombing that proved unsuccessful on may 1 , 2010 , in @entity233			0
-- the @entity222 @entity219 continue to lead a potent insurgency in @entity222 , launching persistent attacks against @entity4 forces , as well as military , diplomatic , and aid facilities			0
they remain in control of significant swaths of land in rural @entity222 , and will continue to threaten @entity222 stability after the @entity224 combat mission ends in december 2014			0
however , they have shown no interest in mounting an attack against the @entity4 homeland			0
-- the @entity94 - based @entity248 has not conducted a mass - casualty attack outside of the @entity222 - @entity94 region since its lethal rampage in @entity252 in 2008			0
similarly , the @entity253 and the @entity254 have not showed an interest in or ability to engage in international terrorism since an @entity254 - linked terrorism cell was broken up in @entity259 , @entity260 , in 2007			0
-- because of continued government crackdowns throughout @entity262 , the once - virulent threat posed by the @entity11 aligned regional terrorist group @entity264 has decreased significantly over the past few years			1
terror groups have local preoccupations given the weaknesses and the local preoccupations of the terrorist groups described in this story , many @entity4 counterterrorism officials believe the chances of a large - scale , catastrophic terrorist attack in the @entity4 by @entity11 or an @entity11 - affiliated or inspired organization are quite small			2
also , the long - term prognosis for most of these terrorist groups is poor because they have all tended to kill many @entity277 civilians , and they offer no political or economic ideas to cure the real problems of much of the @entity254 world			0
however , continued unrest throughout the greater @entity282 , especially the current turmoil in @entity284 , the rising tensions across the region between @entity169 and @entity287 , the continuing @entity112 civil war and the uncertain future of @entity222 after @entity4 and @entity224 combat troops are withdrawn in december 2014 are all potential wild cards that could create an environment that gives @entity11 and allied groups opportunities to resuscitate themselves			2
and at home , the @entity296 bombings remind us that the @entity4 still faces a threat from disaffected individuals inspired by @entity11 's ideology and who often radicalize in the online world			1
although they are difficult to detect , these individuals are also quite unlikely to be capable of perpetrating an attack even remotely on the scale of 9/11 .			0

@entity307 : @entity26 and @entity39 do n't alter reality about jihad
he says @entity11 central is in trouble and that it offers no solutions to regional problems
@entity307 says some affiliates of @entity11 show life but do n't pose major threat yet to @entity69
