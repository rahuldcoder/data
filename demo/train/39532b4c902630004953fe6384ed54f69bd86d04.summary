the first sign there was a problem friday with @entity5 's @entity4 came at about 45,000 feet , just two minutes after the spaceplane separated from the jet - powered aircraft that carried it aloft , officials said			1
it was n't something overt with @entity4 , said @entity11 , the chief executive of @entity12 in @entity13 , where @entity4 was launched and monitored			2
it was what did n't happen next during the test flight , he said			2
@entity11 did not offer details , but appeared to indicate the spaceplane did not follow its previous test - flight patterns			2
nothing seemed abnormal during the takeoff or flight prior to the spaceplane 's failure , he told reporters			1
" ... if there was a huge explosion , i did n't see it , " @entity11 said			2
according to @entity11 and others , one pilot is dead and another has been hospitalized with serious injuries			1
the injured pilot was airlifted to @entity34 in @entity35 , authorities said			1
@entity5 conducted " extensive ground testing of all parts of the spaceship , " said @entity39 , founder of the @entity40			1
" we 've always known that the road to space is extremely difficult -- and that every new transportation system has to deal with bad days early in their history , " @entity39 said in a statement as he was en route to the firm 's @entity12 site			1
the pilot who is hospitalized parachuted to the ground , @entity5 said			1
" our thoughts and prayers are with the families of all those affected by this tragic accident , " it said			2
the two pilots worked for @entity59 , according to that company 's president , @entity60			1
he declined to publicly identify the pilots or detail their experience			1
" @entity65 is hard , and today was a tough day			0
we are going to be supporting the investigation as we figure out what happened today , and we are going to get through it , " @entity5 ceo @entity66 said			1
" the future rests in many ways on hard , hard days like this			0
" @entity5 has planned for years to sell trips in which @entity4 transports passengers about 62 miles above @entity76 -- the beginning of outer space -- and lets them experience a few minutes of weightlessness before returning to ground			1
news of the crash of @entity4 came just after 10 a.m. local time ( 1 p.m. et )			0
the incident occurred over the @entity87 shortly after @entity4 separated from @entity88 , the vehicle designed to carry it aloft , the @entity85 said			0
the jet - powered @entity88 returned safely to the @entity12 , @entity11 said			0
said @entity39 : " this was the latest part of an extensive test flight program , and the 55th time @entity4 had flown			0
it was @entity88 's 173rd flight and the 35th time @entity4 had flown freely			1
" television footage from @entity98 affiliate @entity97 in @entity99 showed @entity4 in pieces in the @entity87			0
questions are being raised about a new fuel mixture used after @entity60 said it had been ground - tested a number of times , but friday 's flight was the first time it was used in a test flight			1
the @entity109 is sending a " go team " to investigate the test flight failure , the agency said			0
the @entity109 is leading the investigation with @entity85 support , under a voluntary cooperative agreement between the agencies , the @entity85 said			0
the @entity85 regulates the @entity118 commercial space transportation industry , and the agency 's @entity119 provides compliance monitoring and safety inspectors for each @entity85 - authorized launch , the agency said			1
" regulations require that crew members are aware of the inherent risks involved in the operation and acknowledge them , " the @entity85 said			0
deadly day for space tourism -- but future ' rests ' on such days , official says in a written statement , @entity131 administrator @entity130 offered his condolences to the family of the pilot killed in the test flight failure			1
" while not a @entity131 mission , the pain of this tragedy will be felt by all the men and women who have devoted their lives to exploration , " @entity137 said			1
" spaceflight is incredibly difficult , and we commend the passion of all in the space community who take on risk to push the boundaries of human achievement			0
" it 's unclear what the failure of the spaceplane will mean for the program			1
@entity5 planned to send paying customers on @entity4 as early as 2015			1
@entity5 has sold more than 700 tickets , each costing more than $ 250,000 , for future flights			1
several celebrities have already signed up , including @entity163 , @entity164 , @entity165 and @entity166			0
with composite lightweight materials , " feathered " rudders capable of turning 90 degrees and a hybrid rocket engine , @entity4 is as safe as modern technology can make it			0
as designer and aviator @entity176 put it in 2008 , " this vehicle is designed to go into the atmosphere in the worst case straight in or upside down and it 'll correct			0
" opinion : the truth about launching spaceships details of friday 's test flight plan were not immediately known			2
but in previous test flights , @entity4 has been loaded on the jet - powered @entity88 , which can take the spaceplane to about 50,000 feet before the spaceplane is released to fly free			0
at that altitude , @entity4 would then fire its @entity188 , a hybrid rocket engine powered by both solid and liquid fuel			0
@entity4 would reach supersonic speeds on its way to its intended altitude of about 62 miles above the @entity76			0
at that point , people onboard would get about five minutes of weightlessness before the bonds of @entity76 retract with 6 g 's of force			2
the spaceplane would then glide back through the atmosphere to landing			0
friday 's is the second incident in a week involving the commercial space industry			2
on tuesday , an unmanned @entity204 rocket exploded just after takeoff off the coast of @entity206			0
controllers deliberately destroyed the craft after it became apparent there was a problem , a spokesman for @entity208 said thursday			0
