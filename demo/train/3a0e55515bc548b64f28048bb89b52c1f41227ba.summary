@entity0 -- the @entity2 is confirming that it has stored more than 35,000 " whole body " images of people who had entered a @entity6 courthouse in @entity7 , @entity8			1
the images captured by millimeter wave technology are more ghost - like and far less detailed than those produced by " backscatter " machines commonly used by the @entity15 at airports nationwide			1
but the @entity18 , a privacy rights group that obtained the @entity2 photos , said the disclosure shows that body imaging machines can store intrusive images of people 's bodies and that the federal government will store images in the absence of strong judicial or legislative restraints			1
the center and other privacy groups filed suit against the @entity15 this year , asking the court to bar it from using body imagers at airports			0
the disclosure about the @entity2 storing images came this week in response to a @entity39 request from the @entity18			1
in a letter to the center , @entity41 attorneys agreed to give 100 images of the approximately 35,314 images that were stored on the @entity7 courthouse machine from february 2 until july 28			1
it called the 100 images a " representative sample " of stored images			0
a @entity51 spokeswoman said the @entity53 machine in @entity7 automatically stores the images to a hard drive , and security officers can look at an image of the person who just entered the machine and the two previous images			2
but all other images can only be accessed via an administrative passcode , spokeswoman @entity61 said			0
@entity61 said the stored images had never been accessed before the receipt of the @entity66 request			2
@entity67 of the @entity18 conceded that the @entity2 's images are " not particularly revealing " but said this experience highlights the necessity for prohibitions on government 's use of backscatter technology , which can capture far more revealing images by using x-rays to provide detailed images in or under a person 's clothing			1
" the only thing that is preventing the @entity15 from [ storing images ] is that we keep raising this with them , " @entity67 said			0
in written comments this year to @entity1 , the @entity15 said images at airports " can not be stored , transmitted or printed " when in normal operations			0
" @entity15 has clearly demonstrated the extensive steps and strict measures that have been taken to protect passenger privacy , " the agency said			0
the images released to the @entity18 were captured by a machine at the @entity95 in the @entity7 courthouse			1
the @entity2 also tested a machine at a @entity6 courthouse in @entity0 for about 90 days in the 2007 and 2008 time frame , @entity61 said			2
during the test , the machine was not used to screen individuals entering the courthouse , she said			0
that machine was returned to the vendor , and any images that may have been stored on it are no longer under agency control , the @entity41 said .			0

the @entity2 used millimeter wave technology to collect images
the images were of people entering a federal courthouse in @entity7 , @entity8
a sampling of the ghost - like images was obtained under the @entity39
the @entity2 says the images were never accessed before the request
