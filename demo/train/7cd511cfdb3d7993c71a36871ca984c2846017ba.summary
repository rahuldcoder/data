-- a three - goal blitz in nine minutes sent @entity3 second in the @entity4 as they finally ended their hoodoo against champions @entity6 by winning 3 - 1 at @entity7 on monday night			1
goals from @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 put @entity13 's side two points behind leaders @entity15 , and ended a run of five successive defeats to @entity6			1
@entity19 pulled a goal back for the visitors , but it was n't enough to end their miserable run of form as they continue to search for their first win since early november			1
the @entity29 were handed a boost before kickoff as @entity32 midfielder @entity10 was restored to the starting lineup , as well as @entity35 striker @entity34 , but @entity6 's @entity37 forward @entity36 was absent with a knee injury			1
@entity40 's heroes and villains of 2010 the first half was a scrappy affair as @entity6 sat back and invited their opponents to attack them , with neither side creating much in the way of goalscoring opportunities			2
but that all changed five minutes before the break as @entity49 forced @entity6 keeper @entity50 into a fine save with an effort that was curling towards the top corner			2
and just four minutes later @entity3 were ahead			0
@entity9 exchanged passes with @entity54 , before picking up a loose ball in the area and driving it into the corner of the net			0
the home side came roaring out of the traps in the second half , as @entity11 latched onto a loose pass from @entity63 and drew @entity50 before squaring to @entity10 , who stroked the ball into an empty net on 51 minutes			1
little more than a minute later the roles were reversed as @entity10 clipped a ball through to @entity11 , who fired low past @entity50 from the edge of the area			1
@entity6 gave themselves a glimmer of hope on 57 minutes as @entity19 glanced @entity72 's curling freekick into the net , but despite committing plenty of men forward the champions could n't fashion a way back into the match			1
@entity49 and @entity78 had chances to compound @entity6 's misery , but both squandered late opportunities			0
@entity6 's defeat is bound to heap more pressure on their @entity86 manager @entity85 , who has presided over a wretched run of just one win in eight games			2
" we have to wake up because we are asleep , " he told @entity90 after the game			0
" we did not play well but @entity3 did and they deserved to win			0
we must stay focused and continue to work hard			0
" @entity3 boss @entity13 said : " we were disciplined , played for each other and were less nervous and perhaps less adventurous at some stages			0
" let 's hope the game has strengthened our belief and that we can challenge for the championship			0

@entity3 beat @entity6 3 - 1 in the @entity4 on monday
goals from @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 see off *reigning* champions
@entity6 managed a *consolation* through @entity19 but their poor run continues
