-- @entity1 is likely coming -- if it has n't already -- to a state near you			1
since mid-august , the @entity4 had confirmed 153 cases of respiratory illness caused by @entity1 in 18 states : @entity8 , @entity9 , @entity10 , @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25			1
the @entity27 @entity26 has confirmed four cases in patients in @entity31 and @entity32 counties			1
and " in the upcoming weeks , more states will have confirmed cases of @entity37 infection , " the @entity4 said in a statement wednesday			1
" several states are investigating clusters of people with severe respiratory illness , and specimens are still being tested for @entity37			2
it can take a while to test specimens and obtain lab results ... these increases will not necessarily reflect changes in real time , or mean that the situation is getting worse			0
" @entity52 health officials have confirmed three cases of @entity1 in @entity54			1
a fourth suspected case from a patient with severe respiratory illness is still under investigation			0
two of the confirmed cases are children between 5 and 9 , said dr. @entity60 , lead epidemiologist on emerging respiratory viruses at the @entity62			1
the third is a teen between 15 and 19			0
the @entity4 estimates that 10 million to 15 million infections occur in the @entity67 each year			2
these viruses usually appear like the common cold ; symptoms include sneezing , a runny nose and a cough			0
most people recover without any treatment			0
but @entity75 seems to be exacerbating breathing problems in children who have asthma			1
the virus is hard to track as many enteroviruses cause similar symptoms and hospitals generally do not test for specific types			0
but health officials have asked doctors to send in samples if they suspect that @entity75 has caused a patient 's severe respiratory illness			0
enteroviruses " tend to have a summer - fall pattern , " @entity60 said , so the high number of cases will likely subside over the next few months			2
what parents should know in the meantime , parents should be on the lookout for the symptoms of @entity1			2
unfortunately , in the beginning it 's difficult -- if not impossible -- to tell the difference between a regular cold and this type of virus			0
but if your child develops a fever or a rash , or if he has difficulty breathing , seek medical attention right away			2
children with asthma or a history of breathing problems are particularly susceptible for severe symptoms			1
