-- i worked as a @entity4 operations officer and station chief during the @entity5 years			1
in the gray world of espionage , there was a clear distinction , at least in my mind , between the @entity4 and our opponents : they tortured their prisoners , we did not			2
the @entity4 's main opponent was the @entity17 's @entity16 , whose headquarters on @entity19 in @entity20 was notorious for torture			1
in those days , i believed that the greatest thing going for me as an intelligence officer was the fact that i was an @entity25			2
now , as the @entity26 prepares to make public some of the findings of its investigation into @entity4 torture after 9/11 , let 's hope we can start a much needed public reckoning over a tragic mistake that has undermined the very principles i and many others felt we stood for			1
our resorting to torture after 9/11 has cost us dearly -- we can no longer assert that we do not torture our enemies , leaving us in a much weaker position when urging our allies or our opponents to eschew such tactics			1
now any @entity25 , civilian or military , who falls into the hands of our fundamentalist enemies is in even greater danger of being tortured or killed			1
advocates of allowing for the use of torture ( or what they prefer to describe as enhanced interrogation techniques ) assert that since we have n't suffered a major attack since 9/11 , that torture must somehow have played a part in preventing one			2
even president @entity62 , in his admission that unnamed officials " tortured some folks " in extremely dangerous times after 9/11 , seemed only apologetic , not outraged			0
indeed , he appeared to urge understanding for the torturers ' failings			0
meanwhile , there is profound reluctance on the part of @entity4 to reveal its own evaluation of the efficacy of its use of torture , as this might risk disclosing the torturers ' identities -- and those of the people who put them to work			1
( the @entity4 's extraordinary admission that it has essentially spied on the @entity26 by hacking into computers of committee staff members is merely another stark example of its reluctance to come completely clean about what it has been doing )			0
it is difficult not to conclude that such reluctance is largely based on the fact that very little of value was learned -- in line with what is reported to be the conclusion of the @entity26			0
this is all the more frustrating because during my tours in wartime @entity97 in the early 1970s , and as station chief in @entity99 , @entity100 , i worked hard and effectively against the use of torture			0
but it would be almost impossible for me to take such positions today			0
so what do we do now ? in addition to public release of the @entity26 report , the @entity4 should be compelled to make public , with the fewest possible redactions , its detailed internal evaluation of what , if anything , torture achieved , what it failed to do and what its use has cost us			1
based on an examination of that report , and with input from experts in the field , a new executive order should be crafted and considered that bans torture by any @entity25 governmental organization , while also naming techniques , such as water boarding , that are specifically forbidden			2
the basic issue is this : are we a country that stands by its traditional standards and values through thick or thin , or are we a country that says " we can not cope with this situation , so let 's turn to torture ? " for those who assert that @entity25 is weaker than it once was , i would say in response that our lapse into the use of torture simply lends credence to such accusations			1
of course , accountability can be a bitter pill to swallow			0
but if we are to move away from this debilitating tendency to resort to torture when the road ahead looks tough , then accountability must start with those that have brought us to where we are today -- it is essential that they face up to the consequences and costs of their decisions			0
maybe then @entity25 can lead by example on an issue where we have needlessly sacrificed the high ground			0
public release of @entity4 report delayed			2

@entity25 can no longer assert that we do not torture our enemies , argues @entity162
@entity4 should make public any evaluations it might have about effectiveness of torture , @entity162 says
@entity162 : use of torture by @entity25 puts captured @entity25 in even greater danger
