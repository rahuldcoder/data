-- when i was young , one of my best friends lived in my grandmother 's village			0
i saw @entity6 every weekend as we made our way through childhood -- she in the village school and i in the town school			1
we finally came together as students in secondary school			0
sadly , @entity6 studied with me for only one term , as her parents could not afford the school fee of $ 6			1
she returned to her village , married early and had more than a half - dozen children			0
she lives there still , locked in poverty			2
my parents , on the other hand , could afford the school fees , and i was lucky enough to finish my schooling and eventually to run a successful business			0
now , i am president of @entity26			1
on wednesday , i take the floor of the @entity28 as the second female president of an @entity31 country , and one of about 14 in the world , i am honored to bring my message of hope for @entity26 and for @entity31 to the world			1
when i travel through my country and talk to the people , i see myself and @entity6 in the children i meet , who are bursting with intelligence and creativity and joy			2
but when i take the stage at the @entity44 to represent my country , i also represent the parents of @entity26 's children , the women who fear the dangers of giving birth and the men who search desperately to find work to pay for their families ' basic needs			1
the bad news about @entity26 is not news to anyone			2
about 85 % of @entity26 live in rural villages in extreme poverty ; @entity58 and malaria are rampant			1
a single crop failure can ruin so many			0
these development challenges are intertwined in the lives of @entity26 , and we must fight for progress on many fronts if we are to lift my country from poverty			1
the journeys of women in my country -- and in countries all over the developing world -- are never easy			0
the health of our women in particular is central to many of our development challenges , and is an issue to which i have been devoted since i almost lost my life delivering my fourth child			0
it was only because i was fortunate enough to have access to a specialist in a hospital that i am alive today			0
last year , i visited a hospital where a baby had just died			0
born in the dark of night with no electricity , that child had the cord wrapped around her neck and no one had seen it			0
in clinics i see women waiting to give birth on the floors of the corridors because there is no other place			1
when i took office , i launched the @entity98 and @entity99 , a project that i hope will reverse the poor access to reproductive health services for women in my country			2
our girls , 15 - and 16 - year - olds , are having children themselves ; they should be going to school , and we must support them and provide them with family planning education			1
when we empower women with education and access to reproductive health services , we can lift an entire nation			1
women who can choose when to have children and how many they will have are more likely to complete their education , start small businesses and participate actively in society			0
and as i witnessed with my friend @entity6 , education itself is vital to give women that choice in the first place			1
this is why efforts to improve the lives of women and children reinforce efforts to strengthen our economy and reduce poverty			2
after the speeches of the world leaders are over , the @entity28 will come together to determine how it will tackle poverty and set benchmarks to measure progress in economic development			0
i will do everything i can to make sure that women 's reproductive health remains a central focus			2
we can not afford to squander the potential of girls such as @entity6 any longer			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity148 .			0

childhood friend of @entity26 president @entity148 had to drop out of school
@entity6 's family could *n't* pay for school , @entity148 says , so now she lives in poverty with kids
@entity148 : in @entity26 , girls often give birth and have no health care
@entity148 calls for education , access to birth control to lift families out of poverty
