@entity0 may not be missing after all -- in fact , she might be missing by her own accord			1
that 's what her family said thursday , after days of pushing for help in finding the 33 - year - old last seen leaving her in - law 's house in @entity10 , @entity11 , just northeast of @entity12			1
but the bottom line is that @entity0 is still missing , nearly two weeks after she went for a walk			1
pointing to investigative work done by the @entity10 police , the @entity16 and @entity17 , the family said they now believe @entity0 may have gone missing intentionally			1
" there is evidence that @entity0 may have voluntarily left the area , and we understand this is a strong possibility , " the family said in a statement posted thursday on a @entity23 page devoted to finding the young woman			1
if nothing else , @entity0 is a veteran traveler			1
in the last couple of years , she traveled the world with her husband , @entity32 , in an epic 22 - month trek that she extensively documented in a blog			1
they climbed @entity36 , swam in the @entity37 , attended an @entity39 wedding and much , much more			0
then , in december , the couple returned to the @entity41			0
her brother , @entity43 , said upon returning to the @entity41 , the couple had spent a short time in @entity44 , then went to @entity11 for a few weeks to visit @entity32 's family			1
he said they were working to find jobs in @entity48 , where the couple was married and had settled			0
coming back to her native country was n't necessarily easy , her family suggested			2
" the pressure of transitioning from her two - year trip back into what we consider ' normal ' life seems to have left her very anxious and stressed , " they said			1
on january 17 , @entity0 told her family she 'd be back in about an hour after setting out on a walk from her in - laws ' residence where she and her husband were staying			1
@entity32 told @entity64 affiliate @entity63 , " she left on her own free will			2
that is what she did			0
that is absolutely true , but what happened after she left the house on her own free will i do n't know			2
" he and other relatives and friends worked intently to spread the word after she did n't return , as the search for her expanded			2
her brother told @entity64 two helicopters searched for nearly three hours six days after she was last seen , and that followed ground searches the previous two days			0
" it 's baffling right now about what happened			2
maybe she fell and hurt herself			0
you start thinking about things			0
i do n't think she had any enemies			0
she is loved very much , " @entity43 said then			0
the biggest such search -- covering 23 square miles , by air and land -- was last saturday			0
@entity10 police noted their serious concern about @entity0 last week , while adding " there is no indication at this time that ( her disappearance ) is criminal in nature			2
" they and other authorities talked to relatives and friends , combed through e-mails and text messages , checked out phone records and contacts -- all in addition to looking for physical signs of her			0
but none of these efforts have revealed any " evidence ... of her presence , " according to her family			2
" if @entity0 has indeed fled the area , she is extremely vulnerable , " they said			1
" she left with only a few assets and is traveling very light			0
" the family added that while @entity0 is athletic , " she is small in stature			1
" " her mental and physical status is uncertain , " they said			0
" we fear for her greatly			0
" the facebook page devoted to finding her continued pleading thursday night -- shortly after the family 's statement came out -- for the public 's help , asking people to print and post fliers with her picture and share her story through social media			1
" continue to send your positive thoughts and prayers to the family and friends of @entity0 who are really in need of them now , " the post said .			1
