you 've got a week and a bit to get your s --- together , otherwise i 'm blowing the airport sky high			0
" he claimed it was a joke and sent it during a moment of frustration while the airport in the north of @entity33 was closed by snow			0
the original trial heard that the tweet was discovered when an airport manager , who was not a @entity39 member , searched for " @entity19 " on the social networking site			0
thousands of people joined an online campaign to support @entity43 , retweeting his message , and recently posting @entity39 comments under the hashtag # twitterjoketrial			2
the high - profile @entity6 actor , broadcaster and prolific tweeter , @entity51 , said friday : " complete vindication and victory for @entity15 in # twitterjoketrial			1
well done @ @entity55 and team			0

the airport police took no action			0
" the verdict prompted a grateful response from @entity43 who said to his @entity39 followers : " we could n't have done this without you , we would n't have got close			2
" @entity6 comedian @entity76 tweeted : " # twitterjoketrial means comedians will feel more secure tweeting jokes and people making threats will try work in some humour			2
" another @entity6 actor and comic , @entity86 , who has notched up major tv successes on both sides of the @entity89 , was more provocative in his reaction , tweeting : " original judge in the @entity15 twitter joke trial admits he was only joking when he convicted @entity15			1
" @entity94 , a prominent author and scientist , added : " he may have got off , but after years of angst and expense # twitterjoketrial is a disappointing stain on the credibility of the @entity6 judiciary			2
" defense solicitor in the case , @entity103 , was equally scathing in his reaction , tweeting : " this shameful prosecution should never have been brought			0
the @entity105 [ @entity106 ] made the personal decision to oppose the appeal			0
" the hashtags # @entity15 and # twitterjoketrial were both trending in the @entity6 friday , but if anyone was opposed to the verdict they were not immediately visible on the social networking site			1
