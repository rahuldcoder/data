-- tensions continue in @entity2 , with soldiers in unmarked green uniforms positioned at military bases and major cities , and citizens fearfully awaiting a resolution to the conflict			1
although @entity12 president @entity11 says these soldiers do not belong to @entity12 , their military vehicles ' license plates -- and even some of the troops themselves -- suggest otherwise			1
at the port of @entity19 , where about 100 soldiers were stationed , a commander openly told @entity0 that he and his men were from the @entity12 @entity22 , which has a base in @entity2 's port city of @entity25			1
outside the @entity27 headquarters in @entity25 , a woman and her young daughter were stopped from bringing soup and meatballs to her husband inside wednesday			2
angry @entity12 supporters descended on her , calling her a " provocateur " and accusing her of being paid to make trouble			1
" i 'm here to give them food , because they 're hungry , " she said of the people inside			0
" no one is feeding them			0
they ca n't go in or out			0
" since last week , members of a self - appointed civil defense force -- volunteers who support @entity12 -- have blocked the headquarters entrance , backed up by masked , armed men in green combat fatigues , presumed to be @entity12 soldiers			1
the men blocking the navy headquarters entrance turned away a @entity25 @entity54 worker who tried to bring in supplies			0
" there are no problems with food , " one of the men told him			0
" anyone who wants to eat can go home			0
" across the street , wives and mothers have gathered to wave to the men holed up inside			2
locals in @entity2 are on edge			1
opinion : @entity71 towns -- apricot trees and vanished graves in @entity75 wednesday , @entity74 , 24 , observed a small demonstration , consisting mostly of women , advocating against war coming to @entity2			1
the held signs with messages such as " @entity11 , get your hands off @entity2			1
" pro-russian activists pushed the protesters from where they were standing and ripped their signs , @entity74 said			0
before the invasion , @entity71 and @entity12 military units interacted closely in places like @entity25 , said @entity74 , who has been translating for international radio journalists this week , but the soldiers who have invaded military bases appeared to be keeping their distance			1
@entity71 officials say 10 military installations that has been surrounded or taken over by @entity12 forces -- 16,000 troops in the past week			1
" either you surrender , or you 're at the gunpoint of your ex-friend , " @entity74 said			0
at a @entity71 air base in @entity102 , near @entity25 , @entity103			1
@entity104 decided to face the green - clad troops peacefully on tuesday			0
as the @entity71 approached , the intruders fired warning shots , as shown in a video recorded by one of the @entity71 soldiers			1
" stop , or i 'll be forced to shoot at your legs , " one of the intruding soldiers said in @entity12			1
" you 're standing here with machine guns , " @entity104 said			0
" and we 're standing here without weapons			0
" this confrontation resolved itself peacefully			2
but it showcases how tense the conflict has become , and how quickly it could become violent			0
dozens of military families live at @entity102 and find themselves caught in the middle			2
" we 're asking our government and the @entity12 government to get together as quickly as possible to sort this out , " said @entity127 , wife of a @entity71 soldier			2
the same tensions are playing out at the @entity134 military base , with an unmarked army -- presumably @entity12 -- locked in a mysteriously cordial standoff with @entity71 soldiers			1
army wives there are anxious that war might come			1
they say @entity141 , the newly installed @entity142 leader of @entity2 , has put their husbands in an impossible situation			2
" if they do not take the oath to the new @entity2 authorities , then there will be fighting , " one woman told @entity0 's @entity146			2
" and if there is a drop of blood spilled on either side , then our husbands will be held responsible			0
" anchor quits : i ca n't be part of network ' that whitewashes ' @entity11 's actions @entity11 said tuesday that local @entity71 asked @entity12 for help , and that his military is n't planning to seize the @entity2 peninsula			1
any action would " only be to protect local people , " he said			0
but @entity11 has denied that troops in @entity2 belong to @entity12 ; instead , he described the armed men as " local self - defense forces , " not @entity12 troops			1
before the crisis broke out , a significant number of @entity12 troops already were stationed in @entity2 under an agreement reached between @entity71 and @entity12 in the 1990s			1
it appears that in recent days they have been deployed to places such as @entity19 -- a port on the strait connecting the @entity180 and the @entity181 -- and @entity182 , but it is unclear how many other forces may have come directly from @entity12			2
in @entity188 , the capital of @entity2 , the regional government building boasts a @entity12 flag flying next to the @entity2 flag ; the @entity71 flag has been taken down , @entity0 's @entity185 reported			1
many people in @entity2 say they want the @entity12 troops there to " save them from the ' fascists , ' " @entity185 said , noting the epithet some have used to describe the pro-western @entity71 government that has taken over since the ousting of president @entity198			1
but not everyone shares this view			0
@entity201 , 35 , from the coastal @entity2 city of @entity203 , says @entity12 supporters in his region tend to be over 30 , while younger people seem less supportive of @entity12			1
for his part , @entity201 does not think the invasion is justified and can not understand why the @entity12 troops have come to @entity2			1
there are no " fascists , " he says			0
" here , just local people -- that 's all we have , " he said			0
@entity74 said the notion of fascists in @entity71 has been part of @entity12 " propaganda			2
" like @entity201 , she is against the invasion			0
" the people who share the same view as mine , they are afraid for their well - being , " she said			0
as of tuesday night , @entity201 had not seen any @entity12 soldiers in @entity203 , or any other direct evidence of a @entity12 military presence , but the situation troubles him			2
