-- @entity1 simply did n't want to be at work , and in the process cost the @entity4 nearly a half - billion dollars and one attack submarine			1
@entity1 admitted to setting fire to the @entity8 , a nuclear sub , in may 2012 while it was in dry dock			1
he was sentenced to 17 years in federal prison in march and ordered to pay $ 400 million in restitution -- roughly the cost of the damage			1
the @entity4 wo n't see anything close to that amount from @entity1 , of course , but neither will it from @entity19			1
on tuesday , the @entity4 announced that despite the demand for attack submarines being " as strong as ever , " the @entity8 is being inactivated			2
the reason : under sequestration , the federal government 's forced budget cuts , the @entity4 simply ca n't afford to make the repairs			1
" the type of damage was unlike anything we 'd seen in recent memory , " rear admiral @entity27 , director of undersea warfare , said on a @entity30 blog post			1
" the anticipated scope of work is four times greater than any previous submarine repair due to damage , " the post continued			1
military shows @entity42 where mandatory cuts will hit home @entity27 blamed across - board budget cuts , saying , " sequestration pressures remove the needed foundation of stability to support an endeavor of this magnitude			0
" @entity1 was working inside the @entity8 on may 23 as a painter and sandblaster while the @entity54 - class attack submarine was at the @entity55 in @entity56 undergoing a massive overhaul			1
initial investigations by the @entity4 found that the fire may have been started by a vacuum cleaner			2
but a federal criminal complaint said @entity1 admitted to setting fire to a pile of rags near a vacuum cleaner in a stateroom in the submarine			1
seven people were injured in the blaze , including three shipyard firefighters			0
the sub 's reactor was not operating when the fire broke out and remained unaffected and stable throughout , capt. @entity73 , commander for the shipyard , said at the time			0
@entity1 also admitted to starting a second fire at the dry dock three weeks later , according to federal court documents			2
the second fire was started in an area underneath the submarine where @entity1 was working			2
in both cases , he told investigators that he started the fires because he was having extreme anxiety and was trying to get out of work , according to federal documents			0
@entity87 sens. @entity86 and @entity88 of @entity56 , and @entity89 and @entity90 of @entity91 , expressed their disappointment at the announcement , saying in a statement that inactivating the @entity8 , " will mean a loss to our nuclear submarine fleet -- yet another unfortunate consequence of the across - the - board cuts known as sequestration			1
we will continue to work together to find a responsible budget solution that replaces sequestration			2
" @entity103 launches largest warship since @entity105 the @entity8 was commissioned in 1990 and was one of 42 @entity54 - class subs in the @entity87 fleet			0
it carried a crew of 12 officers and 98 enlisted personnel , according to the @entity4 , and was capable of carrying @entity114 cruise missiles and @entity116 torpedoes			0
no weapons were on board at the time of either fire , according to the @entity4			2
this is the second warship the @entity4 has lost this year			0
the @entity122 , a minesweeper , ran aground on the @entity124 in the @entity125 in january , damaging an estimated 43,000 square feet of the @entity126			0
to prevent further damage to the reef , salvagers had to cut it into pieces to lift off			0
it was struck from the fleet in february			0
@entity0 's @entity134 contributed to this report .			0

@entity1 is serving 17 years for setting fire to the @entity8
the fire caused $ 400 million damage to the nuclear submarine
because of sequestration , the @entity4 says , it ca n't afford the repairs
rear admiral : scope of required work is " four times greater " than any previous repairs
