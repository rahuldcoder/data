-- headlines and pundits once again declare that we have a crisis on our hands in the wake of discovering that @entity7 is building a new nuclear reactor and a uranium enrichment plant			1
more ominously , tuesday brought news of direct artillery barrages between @entity12 , heightening tensions and costing lives			0
but as provocative and serious as this is , neither is a crisis			0
both fit a clear pattern of @entity7 behavior -- a pattern that ultimately holds out the opportunity for progress			1
unfortunately , so far the @entity23 response also fits a pattern of rhetorical condemnation but little in the way of creative or effective engagement			1
some key lessons need to be re-learned in light of these developments			0
first , the fundamental security situation with respect to @entity7 has not changed			1
@entity34 's estimated stockpile of plutonium bombs remains the same ( four to eight bombs ' worth )			0
it does not have the capability to deliver these devices by aircraft or missile and its plutonium program remains frozen or perhaps even further eroded , as described in a report by dr. @entity44 , who visited the @entity7 's nuclear facilities two weeks ago			1
tuesday , in a briefing in @entity47 , @entity44 , the former head of the @entity49 , said that his report had been " hyped " in the media			0
he detailed how the new facilities , while potentially capable of producing material for bombs , are hardly the quickest route for @entity7 to do so			2
uranium weapons are bigger than plutonium weapons , thus more difficult to shrink to the size needed for a missile warhead			2
the facility @entity44 visited could only produce one or two bombs ' worth of material a year , it is not clear when it will be fully operational and it has been built to replace the plutonium production facilities , not add to them			0
the new , small light - water reactor under construction is actually not very good for producing weapons - grade plutonium			0
if @entity7 wanted to expand its nuclear arsenal , it makes much more sense for it to restart the plutonium reactor it has , not replace it with this new one			2
finally , the @entity7 said they would scrap their plutonium capabilities completely in exchange for improved relations with the @entity23			1
in short , it is conceivable that the facilities are what the @entity7 claims , its attempt at home - grown nuclear energy , a goal the @entity7 has had for decades			2
as @entity44 said , the trip raised " as many questions as it answered			0
" second , as difficult as engagement is , it is preferable to the alternative , isolation and instability			0
remember that @entity7 succeeded in acquiring or building these new facilities during a time when sanctions were extreme and @entity23 engagement was absent			1
in fact , we only know about the facilities because of an unofficial visit by @entity23 whom the @entity7 wanted to use to reveal them			1
before that , the @entity105 administration 's years - long policy of complete isolation allowed @entity7 to produce plutonium , fashion it into bombs and test two of them			1
only in the last two years of the @entity105 era did a change in @entity23 approach bear some fruit in freezing @entity7 's programs			1
" strategic patience " has been the nickname for the @entity23 approach to @entity7 since the early weeks of the @entity121 administration , when @entity34 rejected early overtures of dialogue			1
what the administration failed to grasp is that diplomacy with the @entity7 is pretty much the most difficult exercise one can do in international relations			2
but that does not mean you should n't continue to try , even when -- or maybe especially when -- the response is a poke in the eye			0
so where does this leave us ? what can or should the @entity23 do to respond to these latest developments ? here again , everything old is new again : creative , thoughtful approaches to engaging @entity7 have to be designed and tested -- persistently			1
yes , @entity23 overtures will annoy allies in the region , but not if done in concert with or through consultation with them			2
yes , the administration will suffer reactionary criticism from the right for " dealing with evil " or similar screeds			0
but the stakes are too high to allow the long - term threats that @entity7 poses to be hamstrung by near - term political scorekeeping			2
president @entity121 has to be bold			0
a number of ideas about how to proceed are offered in a recent piece by @entity157 of the @entity158			0
these suggestions , including economic incentives and diplomatic measures such as a trip by secretary of state @entity163 to @entity7 and the conclusion of a peace declaration involving both @entity166 and @entity167 , are a good starting point			1
@entity169 , an ancient @entity167 expert on the region , advised , " keep your friends close and your enemies closer			0
" good advice and as relevant as ever for the @entity23 regarding @entity7			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity177 and @entity178 .			0

@entity7 's artillery barrage was serious , but this is not a crisis , say *co-authors*
they say the action fits pattern of @entity7 's behavior and does n't *preclude* progress
*revelation* of a uranium enrichment plant does n't signal escalation in its weapons capability , they say
@entity23 needs to try economic and diplomatic measures to move ahead , they say
