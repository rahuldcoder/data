the disappearance of @entity6 between @entity7 and @entity8 over the weekend -- and discovery of debris from the plane two days later -- caps a bizarre year in aviation			1
but could 2014 be the worst year in recent aviation history ? yes and no. depends on how you define " worst			1
" crashes in terms of crashes , 2014 has seen the lowest number in more than 80 years , says the @entity20 - based @entity19 , or @entity21			1
with the @entity6 disappearance now counted as a crash , this year 's number totals 111			1
the last time the world had 111 crashes was in 1927			1
" if you consider sheer numbers of aircraft crashes , flying today is safer , " says @entity27 , an analyst with the @entity28 , a global aviation consulting group			1
" however , there are more aircraft in the sky , so naturally the overall number may appear similar to previous decades and , in some categories of disaster , higher			1
" fatalities in terms of fatalities , the numbers paint a grimmer picture			2
before @entity4 , aviation disasters this year claimed 1,158 lives			1
the @entity6 flight was carrying 162 people ; authorities have not issued a statement on whether everybody died			2
if all the people on board died , this year would have the most aviation deaths -- 1,320 -- since 2005 , according to @entity21			1
already , 2014 has put an end to a steadily improving global aviation safety record			1
" every 10 years or so , we have a year that is less safe than others			1
unfortunately this year was one of those , " said @entity58 with the @entity21			1
last year , 265 people were killed in flight incidents , marking the safest year in aviation since 1945 , the @entity61 said			2
the @entity61 and the @entity21 track their numbers differently			1
the @entity61 says its figures on fatal aircraft accidents include only civil aircraft of which the basic model has been certified for carrying 14 or more passengers			2
the @entity21 includes accidents of aircraft capable of carrying at least six passengers , besides the crew			1
another key difference : the @entity61 does n't include fatalities from @entity78 17 because it does not count shoot - downs or acts of sabotage in its safety indicator numbers			0
the @entity21 statistics count " any event where aircraft suffered such damage that it is not in a position to be used anymore			1
" bad year for @entity90 @entity90 has endured a particularly brutal year			0
before 2014 , @entity91 had an excellent safety record			2
then in march , @entity1 disappeared en route from @entity94 to @entity95 with 239 aboard			0
officials believe that plane is somewhere in the @entity98			2
but , nine months later , @entity1 has n't been found			0
in july , @entity99 was shot down over eastern @entity100 , killing all 298 aboard			0
while @entity6 is based in @entity78 , the flight that crashed sunday was operated by @entity102 , an affiliate with hubs in @entity104 and @entity105			0
the wreckage was not found until tuesday , creating a fear that two airliners had disappeared in the same year in the same part of the world			0
search teams located @entity6 debris on tuesday in the @entity113			0
@entity6 had a near flawless safety record , with no previous fatal accidents			0
but now that record has changed			0
" this is my worst nightmare , " @entity6 ceo @entity117 tweeted as crews searched for @entity4			0
( two other disasters claimed dozens of lives , both in july			0
in @entity122 , 48 died on @entity123			0
the cause of that crash is unclear			0
the crash of @entity127 killed 116 people while en route from @entity129 to @entity130			0
the plane went down in @entity132			2
the cause of that crash is also uncertain , but the plane changed flight paths because of bad weather			2
) still safe when air disasters happen , they make news			0
but on the whole , far fewer people die in plane crashes than in cars			1
about 1.24 million people die each year on the world 's roads , the @entity144 said last year			0
by contrast , the deadliest year in aviation had 3,346 deaths , the @entity21 said			1
since then , technology has improved and airlines , insurance companies and regulators have worked to increase aviation safety levels to get closer to zero risk , said @entity58			2
" accidents are not always avoidable , " he said , but " with each accident , we learn something new and improve			0
" according to the @entity163 , the number of commercial flight departures has grown in recent years to 30 million in 2011			1
despite the fatalities from this year , @entity164 said , " that 's a relatively low rate when you compare it to the massive numbers of people who are flying today			2
" @entity0 's @entity171 contributed to this report .			0

2014 has had the lowest number of plane crashes in over 80 years , the @entity21 says
but 2014 had the most aviation deaths since 2005
statistics show flying is still far safer than driving
