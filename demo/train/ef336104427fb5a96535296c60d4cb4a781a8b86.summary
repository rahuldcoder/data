@entity0 -- house speaker @entity3 's proposal to avert the looming fiscal cliff 's automatic tax increases failed to curry enough @entity7 support thursday night , after which @entity8 left for the holiday with no clear end in sight in the high - stakes debate			1
@entity3 said earlier thursday that he was confident that his so - called @entity13 -- which would extend tax cuts that are set to expire at year 's end for most people while allowing rates to increase to 1990s levels on income over $ 1 million -- would pass the @entity20 , and in the process put pressure on president @entity23 and the @entity25 - controlled @entity24			1
but his gambit seemed in doubt later as @entity7 leaders struggled to get most all their members to sign on -- even enlisting senators like sen. @entity31 , to work the @entity20 floor -- knowing the chamber 's @entity25 oppose it			1
then , around 8 p.m. , @entity20 majority leader @entity34 announced that the measure would not go up for a vote as planned			0
" @entity20 did not take up the tax measure today because it did not have sufficient support from our members to pass , " @entity3 said in a statement			1
" now it is up to the president to work with @entity46 ( @entity45 ) @entity44 on legislation to avert the fiscal cliff			1
" @entity25 leaders already had signaled they oppose the so - called @entity13 after thursday night 's unexpected reversal , @entity7 legislators walked past reporters through the halls of @entity8 , and most did not take questions			1
one who did -- rep. @entity56 , an @entity57 who will move to the @entity24 next month -- said he was disappointed			0
" it 's too bad ; i 'd rather vote on it tonight , " said @entity56 , who said he sides with @entity25 in backing the extension of tax cuts except for household income of more than $ 250,000			2
" what this means next in the fiscal cliff talks is unclear			1
from here , scenarios range from intensified and ultimately successful talks in the coming days or entrenchment as the fiscal cliff becomes a reality next year , when a new @entity8 could enter negotiations with @entity23			1
the @entity13 was significant because @entity7 leaders previously insisted they would n't raise rates on anyone , while @entity23 called tax rates for those earning more than $ 250,000 threshold to return to 1990s levels while extending tax cuts for everyone else			1
although the @entity20 did n't vote on @entity3 's tax measure , most @entity7 did vote together earlier thursday as the @entity20 narrowly approved , 215 - 209 , a related measure to alter automatic spending cuts set to kick in next year under the fiscal cliff , replacing cuts to the military with reductions elsewhere			1
the @entity90 said this would lead to $ 217.7 billion in cuts over the next decade , short of the $ 1.2 trillion in cuts that would go into effect in january if the fiscal cliff is n't averted			1
moments after that vote , the @entity95 issued a statement indicating it would veto this bill			2
but that should be a moot point , since senate majority leader @entity44 has said he wo n't bring it up for a vote			0
@entity7 consider piggybacking spending cuts to ' @entity13 ' " for weeks , the @entity95 said that if i moved on rates , that they would make substantial concessions on spending cuts and entitlement reforms , " house speaker @entity3 said before his plan fell flat			1
" i did my part			0
" while the @entity113 congressman said @entity23 seems " unwilling to stand up to his own party on the big issues that face our country , " @entity25 say @entity7 leaders are buckling to their conservative base by backing off as negotiations seemed to be nearing a deal			0
@entity95 spokesman @entity122 called the @entity7 alternatives " a major step backwards , " claiming they 'd lead to extended tax cuts of $ 50,000 for millionaires			2
@entity44 slammed the two @entity7 measures -- the one that passed and the one that was n't brought up for a vote -- as " pointless political stunts			0
" the war of words notwithstanding , @entity3 , @entity122 and @entity24 @entity25 leaders all said they are ready to talk			0
@entity44 has said the @entity24 -- with many members attending a memorial service friday and funeral in @entity139 on sunday for sen. @entity140 -- will be back at work december 27			0
and after thursday 's session , @entity34 's office said legislative business was finished for the week but the @entity20 could reconvene after @entity145 if needed			2
" i remain hopeful , " @entity3 said			0
" our country has big challenges , and the president and i are going to have to work together to solve those challenges			0
" the path toward the fast - approaching fiscal cliff the possibility of a fiscal cliff -- which economists warn will hit the @entity157 economy hard -- was set in motion two years ago , as a way to force action on mounting government debt			1
negotiations between top @entity163 and @entity25 resumed after @entity23 's re-election last month as did the barbs from both sides			0
polling has consistently shown most @entity157 back the president , who insists wealthy @entity157 must pay more , rather than @entity3 and his @entity7 colleagues , who have balked at tax rate hikes and demanded spending cuts and entitlement program reforms			1
a new @entity1 / @entity174 survey released thursday showed that just over half of respondents believe @entity7 should give up more in any solution and consider the party 's policies too extreme			0
@entity1 poll : are @entity7 policies too extreme ? the two sides seemingly had made progress on forging a $ 2 trillion deficit reduction deal that included new revenue sought by @entity23 and spending cuts and entitlement changes desired by @entity3			2
senior administration officials said @entity23 and @entity3 have not spoken since monday , when the president made a counterproposal to a @entity7 offer over the weekend			0
the president 's offer set $ 400,000 as the household income threshold for a tax rate increase			2
it also included a new formula for the consumer price index applied to benefits for programs such as @entity201 , @entity202 and @entity203 to protect against inflation , much to the chagrin of some liberals			0
the new calculation , called chained @entity208 , includes assumptions on consumer habits in response to rising prices , such as seeking cheaper alternatives , and would result in smaller benefit increases in future years			0
statistics supplied by opponents say the change would mean @entity201 recipients would get $ 6,000 less in benefits over the first 15 years of chained @entity208			0
@entity3 essentially halted negotiations by introducing his @entity13 on tuesday			0
he described it as a fallback option to prevent a sweeping tax increase when tax cuts dating to president @entity226 's administration expire in two weeks			2
the spending cut vote -- similar to one passed by the @entity20 last year that went nowhere in the @entity24 -- was added to the docket later thursday , to appeal to conservative legislators upset about backing a tax increase without acting on spending and protecting the military budget			2
the @entity20 speaker 's reasoning was that the passage of @entity13 and the spending bill would put the onus on @entity23 and @entity24 @entity25 to accept them or offer a compromise			1
for now , the @entity23 administration wo n't have to weigh in on the tax part of that scenario			0
as to the @entity20 - approved spending cuts bill , @entity95 spokeswoman @entity243 dismissed the @entity7 alternative as " nothing more than a dangerous diversion " for eliminating federal funding by negatively impacting millions of seniors , disabled individuals and poor and at - risk children			1
in a statement thursday night , the @entity95 did n't address thursday 's @entity20 proceedings but referenced its top priority -- ensuring that 98 % of @entity157 do n't see their taxes rise in january			1
the statement expressed confidence that there will be deal on the fiscal cliff but with no explanation of how , when or what such an agreement would look like			2
" the president will work with @entity8 to get this done , and we are hopeful that we will be able to find a bipartisan solution quickly that protects the middle class and our economy , " the @entity95 said			1
delay of 100 million tax returns ? @entity1 's @entity269 , @entity270 , @entity271 and @entity272 contributed to this report .			0

new : " the president will work with @entity8 to get this done , " the @entity95 says
the @entity20 speaker says his @entity13 was n't voted on because it did n't have " sufficient support "
a bill to alter cuts did narrowly pass the @entity20 ; the @entity95 says it would veto
the fiscal cliff 's tax hikes and spending cuts are set to take effect in january
