@entity0 -- even in the best of times , running a charity is n't easy			1
try doing it during a recession			0
" individual giving has declined			0
foundations , which give us funding , have lost money and ca n't give what they have in the past , " said @entity7 , executive director of @entity8 , a @entity0 nonprofit that assists men and women who are homeless or at risk of becoming homeless			1
" @entity7 's job got easier , however , once he met @entity18			1
@entity18 , 37 , has made it his mission to collect donated goods in @entity0 , sort through them and get them to charities in need			1
for @entity26 , help came in the form of free toiletries for the shelters that @entity8 works with			0
now , every month , @entity18 delivers about 200 pounds of donated shampoo , conditioner and lotion and about 1,000 rolls of toilet paper			1
during the three years they 've worked together , @entity26 estimates , @entity18 has brought them more than $ 20,000 worth of products -- for free			1
" @entity37 builds these relationships with donors , gets these products and then brings them to us , " @entity7 said			2
" having someone that is willing to do all the legwork is essentially saving an agency like us a full - time employee			0
i ca n't stress how invaluable he is			0
" more than 200 charities across @entity0 have benefited from @entity18 's unique brand of assistance			1
since 2009 , he has collected 145,000 pounds of goods -- estimated to be worth more than $ 1 million -- through his nonprofit , @entity54			2
he places 55 - gallon bins across the city , in residential areas and businesses such as dental offices and hotels , where people can deposit reusable goods			2
then , every weekend , he gathers the donated contents , sorts them with the help of volunteers and distributes the goods to local nonprofits that need them			1
" when people come up to a bin , i have signage that says exactly what 's needed			2
... i make sure everything is very focused , " @entity18 said			1
" i do my research and find out what they need and collect that , or find places that need what i have			0
" do you know a hero ? nominations are open for 2013 @entity84 @entity85 , director of housekeeping at @entity0 's @entity87 , was always bothered by the half - empty toiletries the housekeepers had to throw away at the end of each guest 's stay			1
he 'd tried to find groups to come and pick up the items , but for various reasons , it had never worked out			0
now , @entity85 's staff collects the used amenities on their carts and puts them in @entity54 barrels at the end of the day			1
when the bins are full , @entity18 picks them up			1
" for ( him ) to actually take this and give it to somebody that needs this is a relief , " @entity85 said			0
" it 's nice knowing that my staff is supporting that and there 's people getting to benefit from it instead of just tossing it away			2
" most charities do n't mind receiving partially used goods			1
" it 's not about aesthetics for our clients , " @entity7 said			2
" things may not look as pretty as they do if you go into a retail store and buy it over the counter			0
the fact is that those items , whether it 's soap or shampoo or half a roll of toilet paper , ( are ) critical to the men and women that @entity8 serves			2
" @entity18 came up with the idea of @entity54 when a friend was having a " clean out the closet " event			1
the friend asked @entity18 whether he knew anyone who would pick up all the donations			1
he did n't , but he had an epiphany			0
he had recently left his job as a recruiter , where he had matched people with the right job			0
maybe he could do something similar for charities			2
" i would be the middleman			0
find the goods , pick them up and drop them off , " he said			2
" i would be able to save time and money for these charities , and in turn , they could focus on what they do			2
" hygiene products , like those provided to @entity8 , make up the majority of @entity18 's donations			1
but over the years , he has collected and distributed thousands of pounds of food as well as school supplies , toys and books			1
he is also known locally as the man who will accept any and all donations			0
when a sales company had 8,000 pencil sharpeners to contribute , @entity18 brought them to charities that work with school - age children			1
one company donated 150 alarm clocks ; @entity18 gave them to a nonprofit that provides housing to people with mental illness			1
and when a local hotel was replacing 75 ice buckets and 55 coffee makers , @entity18 parceled them out to various nonprofits in the area			1
" the idea behind a donation drive has been around for eons , " @entity18 said			1
" the difference is , i 'm collecting for everybody			0
" there 's another benefit to @entity18 's work : by delivering goods to those who need them , he 's also keeping the items out of landfills			1
" for a lot of companies or individuals , it 's easier to just throw it away -- out of sight , out of mind , " he said			0
" so really , the concept behind @entity54 is to reduce , reuse , recycle and get another opportunity to have someone to use that item , whatever it might be			0
" it 's a win - win situation			0
we help the charities and the environment at the same time			0
" after working full - time on the project for nearly two years , @entity18 is now working as a recruiter again and keeping the organization going on weekends			2
having sunk his entire savings and 401 ( k ) into the nonprofit , he would love to take his idea national one day			0
" listen , if i won the @entity220 , i would do this bigger , " he said			0
" but ( right now ) i ca n't , so i 'm going to keep on helping the people of @entity0			2
" i get dirty and sweaty , and it 's back - breaking work , but it 's fun , and it makes me happy			0
i set out to make a difference , and that 's what i 'm doing			0
" want to get involved ? check out the @entity229 website and see how to help .			0

@entity18 collects donated goods and gets them to charities in need
whether it 's hygiene products , food or school supplies , he wants nothing to go to waste
many charities in @entity0 lean on his efforts as they struggle for funding
