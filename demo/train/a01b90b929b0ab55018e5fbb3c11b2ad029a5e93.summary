-- with the last day of the @entity1 usually uneventful as it relates to changes in the overall lead , saturday marked the last realistic opportunity someone could catch @entity6			1
but given his big advantage , that was always unlikely			0
and after saturday 's penultimate stage , only a catastrophe can stop @entity6 from becoming just the second @entity12 champion of cycling 's most coveted race in more than 45 years -- @entity15 was the last @entity12 winner in 1998 , preceding @entity18 's now tainted reign			1
as @entity20 's @entity19 claimed the 54 - kilometer time trial from @entity22 to @entity23 , @entity6 finished fourth			1
crucially , though , he carries a nearly eight - minute lead into the final day , a 137.5 - kilometer stretch from @entity26 to the @entity27 in @entity28			1
" i have n't realized yet how big it is to win the @entity1 , " @entity6 of team @entity29 was quoted as saying by the @entity1 's official website			1
" i 'll keep that for tomorrow			0
" it 's difficult to ride the @entity1 but the beauty of it is to cycle on the @entity38 © es. that 's the biggest memory i 've kept from my first participation -- the lap of honor , the enormous number of people , @entity28 ' monuments			2
" i 'll try to savor my victory as much as i can			0
" there has n't been a home champion since @entity49 in 1985 and that drought looks set to continue but the good news for the @entity52 is that two riders -- @entity54 and @entity55 -- should finish on the podium for the first time since 1984			2
@entity54 overtook @entity58 for second			0
@entity54 said the early exits of last year 's winner @entity61 and former winner @entity62 due to wrist and shin injuries , respectively , allowed him to contemplate a runner - up placing			2
" the withdrawals of @entity67 and @entity62 opened a range of possibilities and i started dreaming about this second place , " he said			0
" i 'm happy to have achieved that goal			0
" i have a feeling of mission accomplished and a lot of joy today			0
" @entity19 , a multiple world time trial champion from @entity20 , won his second stage of this year 's race in 1:06.21 , more than a minute - and - a - half quicker than @entity80 @entity79 .			1
