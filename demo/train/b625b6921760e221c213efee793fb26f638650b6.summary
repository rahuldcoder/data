-- dear @entity1 , thank you for reminding us what classic @entity5 beauty looks like today			1
for the rest of @entity5 -- in case any of you have been sleeping for , say , the past two decades , or clinging to out - of - touch fashion magazines -- here 's an alert : beauty is @entity13 and @entity14			1
beauty is @entity16 and @entity17			2
and yes , beauty is @entity19 , @entity1 2014			1
women 's beauty can not be debated or dictated by others			1
so in tribute to women across the globe , i celebrate your beautiful brown skin , your breathtaking @entity30 dance skills , and the hard work that i 'm sure you put in , not only to earn top grades and graduate from the @entity35 with a degree in brain behavior and cognitive science , but to become the first @entity40 - @entity5 woman to take home the tiara			1
the beauty pageant circuit is a tough act , as i learned early from my fleeting experiences as a teen who participated in several pageants			2
do n't laugh , that college scholarship money is no joke			0
back then , there were no other brown girls on the stage			0
my family and friends cheered me on and told me how beautiful i was -- and i had the audacity to believe them			0
sadly , it was the talent portion that always sunk me			0
painting and poetry - writing just did n't cut it as a stage act			0
lucky for me , i found journalism , but those pageants helped give me the confidence to believe that i could share the stage with anyone			0
@entity1 , i hope you use your crown and platform well and that you have the courage to amplify the voices of those women and girls back in your ancestral home , @entity76 , who are valiantly fighting for full equality and the right to live without fear of the brutal sexual violence that plagues that nation			1
you are not the first woman of color to take the crown			0
it was 30 years ago that @entity87 became the first black @entity1			1
seven other black women and one @entity90 woman have won since then			2
and most went on to successful careers			0
but whenever this happens , those pesky bigots climb out of their caves to rant and rave and spew their ignorance about why it 's not fair			0
former miss california : how do we teach kids diversity is beautiful ? clearly , those divergent voices -- and i admit there are many -- failed even the most basic fourth - grade geography lesson and likely could n't even find @entity76 on a map , which is why they mistakenly think you are @entity108			1
perhaps they have you confused with @entity111 , a @entity112 immigrant from @entity113 , @entity114 , who in 2010 was the first @entity108 - @entity5 to win the @entity117 pageant			1
must be hard keeping up with a changing world when you 've spent so much time trying to ignore and reject all those people who look different from you			0
according to the @entity122 , there are 3.2 million people of @entity40 descent living in the @entity5			1
their median income for 2010 was $ 90,711			0
in fact , @entity76 surpassed @entity128 as the nation 's second - largest @entity90 population , after @entity131 , the data show			1
still , some people will never accept that it is families like yours that are helping to make @entity5 a stronger nation			1
do n't let them distract you on your journey			0
sounds like you 're on the right track : " i 'm so happy this organization has embraced diversity , " you said , according to @entity140			0
" i 'm thankful there are children watching at home who can finally relate to a new @entity1			1
" asked about the negativity , you said , " i have to rise above that			0
i always viewed myself as first and foremost @entity5			1
" use those haters to inspire you reach your dream to become a cardiologist , ms. @entity19			1
reject voices that would try to define and limit you			0
reject the magazine covers and fashion gurus , who may understand how to design and sell a pretty dress but have no clue about what defines a woman 's beauty , as evidenced by the consistent and blatant lack of diversity on the runways during @entity164 both here and abroad			1
reject the critics -- men and women -- who bash women like television personality @entity169 for getting plastic surgery after being told by her bosses nearly 20 years ago that her @entity90 eyes would hurt her career			1
@entity176 made her choice back then , and brava for her for starting a public debate now about @entity90 beauty standards			2
today , @entity176 looks wonderful -- hard to tell from a 20 - year - old photo if she had grown to be a natural beauty with her original face			2
but i , for one , want to live in a world where grown women have the right to decide what is best our careers and our bodies			2
was it an awful message to give women in the workplace ? yes			2
but it 's no different from the countless occasions throughout my career that i 've witnessed women being told that they are too fat , too black or too @entity202 to succeed			2
in my first television job , the news director told me that i should study @entity206 's look and voice in order to be better at my job -- like i was ever going to look like @entity206			0
thank goodness @entity211 came along			0
media is a tough career where regardless of your talent , looks really are still everything -- especially for us women			2
and to be fair , i 've known more than a few men who 've gone under the knife or tried extreme diets just to keep their faces in front of the camera			0
but to succeed , we must deal with it ; work to improve the environment for the women behind us , and move on with our lives			2
there 's room on the stage for all types of beauty			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity236 .			1

@entity236 : @entity40 @entity1 a reminder of *universality* of @entity5 beauty
she says these days everyone knows it , even though haters and runway fashion *culture* lag
she says proud @entity40 @entity19 could help draw attention to sex *assault* in @entity76
@entity251 : women , like @entity169 , who changed eyes for tv , can embrace any beauty they want
