dr. @entity66 , the founder of @entity67 , is deeply interested in the personal analytics field			1
in march , he shared detailed analytics of his own work life , using vast amounts of data he 's been collecting about himself , including over two decades of e-mails , a log of every keystroke he 's typed for years ( 100 million plus ) , meetings , phone calls and , thanks to a pedometer , steps taken			0
