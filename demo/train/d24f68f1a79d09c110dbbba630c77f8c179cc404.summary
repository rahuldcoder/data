editor 's note : @entity4 contributor @entity2 is a best - selling author whose current book is " when we get to @entity7 : a journey through @entity9 in @entity10			1
" @entity2 says that when an illness threatens , we realize the vital role of medical researchers			1
( @entity4 ) -- these are times when the cult of celebrity seems especially empty , when our national love affair with multimillion - dollar shortstops and with beautiful actresses whose flawless faces are enough to guarantee huge box - office weekends feels devoid of meaning			1
right now , as the eventual path of the swine flu emergency remains uncertain , the world is beginning to turn its pleading eyes in the direction of men and women whose names and faces we do n't even know			2
they are the men and women who , wearing lab coats in medical and scientific facilities , are working -- as they do every day -- toward the conquest of disease			1
the wider world seldom gives them a thought until suddenly we realize that we need them			1
until abruptly , in the midst of our constant cultural obeisance to flashiness and surface glamour , we are forced to stop and recognize : we need help			2
sickness is upon us , and there are conflicting reports on its potential severity			2
our political leaders say not to panic because it may turn out to be relatively mild , but in the absence of definitive facts the words sound somehow hollow			2
there may not be a cure for all cases			2
the disease , in many ways , seems to hold all the cards			1
times like these do n't come along very often			2
when they do , it is probably a good idea to pause and reflect upon the quiet work done every day by those men and women in the laboratories			1
there were two men , now dead , who , toward the end of their lives , could pass through any airport in the country without being recognized			2
they saved the world 's children : saying those words is not much of an exaggeration			2
yet , by the time they were old men , they were less applauded than the average @entity82 forward or prime - time television make - believe cop			2
but talk about the definition of heroism			2
in the early 1950s the world was in utter terror because a relentless , paralyzing virus was spreading and turning into the cruelest of epidemics			2
in hospitals across the @entity9 , children were confined to iron lungs because polio had robbed them of the power to breathe on their own			1
parents were fearful of letting their sons and daughters play outdoors or swim in public pools , yet the caution was n't helping			2
in separate @entity9 laboratories , two men working separately -- dr. @entity104 and dr. @entity105 -- were determined to defeat the polio virus , to end the heartbreak			1
@entity104 developed the first , injectable polio vaccine ; @entity105 developed an oral vaccine that would eventually supplant it			1
years later , as they were entering the winter of their lives , i sought both of them to speak about what it was like to be working , with the clock ticking , against such a disease			1
" i never thought it could n't be done , " @entity104 told me			1
" yes , of course there were doubters			0
but i did n't pay attention to anybody			0
" there is self - confidence , and then there is self - confidence			1
growing up , @entity104 was not the kind of boy who often heard cheers			1
as one biographical sketch of him put it : " to his schoolmates @entity104 was a person of little importance			1
a thin , small - boned child , untalented at games and not gifted in class , he was tolerated but not sought after			0
" yet he was there when the time of reckoning arrived , when the world needed someone to come through			0
" you ask me what persuades a man that something is doable ? your self persuades you that something is doable , " @entity104 said			1
why , of all the doctors in the world , did it fall upon him to finally stop polio in its tracks ? " i did n't think i was the person appointed to do this , " @entity104 said			1
" i was simply granted the opportunity to help			0
we do not all see the world in the same way			0
there are those of us who see it in terms of solvable problems			0
if you have a problem that can be solved , then it will be solved			0
" and the frustrations that came with trying , on deadline -- in every sense of that word -- to stop a crippling virus ? " you 're not on a golf course , " @entity104 said			1
" you do n't say to yourself , ' today 's the day i 'm going to break par. ' what you do is have a continuing dialogue with nature			0
you ask questions in the form of experiments			0
yes or no. yes or no. yes or no. and then you use those answers to ask your next question , and you keep doing it until you have the ultimate answer			0
" @entity105 was looking for the answer at the same time			1
" you had an epidemic involving thousands upon thousands of children , " @entity105 said			1
" there was obviously a great need , and when there is a need like that , you 've got to keep working even when you have no idea what the outcome is going to be			0
" despondency , he said , was always lurking over his shoulder			0
" there were many times when not only did my colleagues tell me it could n't be done , " he said , " they told me to throw the whole thing down the rathole			0
and i confess to wondering at times whether they might not be right			0
" but i kept at it			0
i kept asking myself , ' what do i have to do ? what is the next step ? '			0
in the middle of the night you often wake up with an idea			0
you have a notebook by your bed so you can write these things down , so that they 're not lost in the morning			0
the fear ! you never lost sight of the human side of what you were doing			0
you were driven on by the knowledge that there was human misery , and that you could use your knowledge to help eliminate it			0
" @entity104 died in 1995 at the age of 80 ; @entity105 died in 1993 at the age of 86			1
but right now , there are men and women at work in laboratories , men and women whose names we do not yet know			1
suddenly we are depending on them			0
perhaps they are feeling exhausted , or overwhelmed			0
i can still hear dr. @entity105 's voice : " there is a line -- i believe it is by sir @entity248 -- that a superior officer of mine during @entity251 quoted to me			1
i shall never forget it : ' @entity254 us to know that it is not the beginning , but the continuing of the same until it is thoroughly finished , that yieldeth the true glory			0
' " the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			1

@entity2 : our culture places *premium* on what celebrities are doing
he says when illness threatens , we realize importance of medical researchers
@entity2 says @entity104 and @entity105 gained fame for their work on polio
confidence and *persistence* helped them conquer the disease , @entity2 says
