-- actor and director @entity1 testified before @entity3 on wednesday about " a campaign of murder " under way in @entity7 , where villagers run for the hills to hide from bombings on a daily basis			1
" what you see is a constant drip of fear , " @entity1 said , a day after returning from a trip in which he and a small team of fellow activists managed to enter one of the most devastated areas , the @entity17 in @entity18			1
" we found children filled with shrapnel , including a 9 - year - old boy who had both of his hands blown off , " @entity1 told the @entity23			1
@entity1 said the attacks are being orchestrated by @entity7 's government , led by president @entity32 , government official @entity33 and defense minister @entity34 -- the same three men , he said , who previously orchestrated long - documented attacks in @entity37			1
" they 're all charged with war crimes and are now proving themselves to be the greatest war criminals of this century by far , " he said			2
the @entity7 government has denied accusations in the past that it is engaged in such attacks			2
this month the @entity46 issued an arrest warrant for @entity34 listing 41 counts of crimes against humanity and war crimes allegedly committed in the @entity37 region of @entity7			1
@entity32 and @entity33 are also facing war crimes charges involving @entity37			2
@entity1 is co-founder of the @entity54 , which uses satellite imagery to watch for aerial attacks and troop movements in @entity7 and @entity58 , which became a separate country last year			1
@entity60 , who created the group with @entity1 , is also co-founder of the anti-genocide @entity62			1
both men traveled to @entity58 last week and worked their way across the border and into @entity18			2
@entity1 wrote and directed a video about the trip for the @entity62			1
it shows people who have had to flee their villages for caves			2
" for the first time since the @entity77 , people are living in caves , " a man identified as a rebel doctor says in the video			2
" we left our homes because we were too scared of the attacks by airplanes and rockets , " says a young woman holding a baby			2
" @entity32 is attacking us			0
" in the video , @entity1 describes the violence as an effort " to clear people out ethnically because of the color of their skin			1
" " it is a campaign of murder and fear and displacement and starvation , " he told the @entity23 committee wednesday			0
a @entity99 report last year said the @entity7 military " regularly conducted aerial bombardments in the @entity17 , and in several towns and villages populated by the @entity104 ( people ) " much of the violence is along ethnic lines and also involves a battle for control of the country 's oil supply , which has shut down in the conflict			1
@entity114 officials at the @entity23 committee hearing wednesday said there is a looming humanitarian crisis in the region , particularly in troubled areas , including @entity18 and the @entity121 region			2
hundreds of thousands of people have been displaced , and many have been cut off from food and basic supplies , said @entity126 of the @entity114 development agency @entity127 , and the @entity7 government has been blocking aid			1
for those people in areas of @entity18 controlled by the opposition @entity132 -- which has battled the @entity7 army -- the outlook is particularly dire , @entity126 said			0
" current predictions are that up to 250,000 people in those areas now face a serious emergency , which is one step short of famine by the end of april if the violence and the restrictions on humanitarian access continues , " she said			1
" it is imperative to have immediate humanitarian access to all communities affected by conflict in @entity18 , " @entity126 said			0
@entity18 and @entity121 straddle @entity7 and @entity58 's geographical and political lines			0
the population in these areas has faced " exclusion , marginalization and discriminatory practices that have resulted in their opposition to the @entity7 government , " the @entity99 @entity150 said last year			0
speaking to @entity0 in advance of his testimony , @entity1 said that in recent weeks , the @entity54 -- which he has previously described as " anti-genocide paparazzi " -- managed to capture images of bombs being dropped on civilians , leaving mass graves			1
@entity60 told @entity0 that documenting the atrocities under way in @entity7 is critical , as is " building a constituency of people in the @entity114 who care about these issues and will tell president ( @entity172 ) @entity171 and their members of @entity3 and senators that it matters to them ... that the @entity114 steps up and takes a leading role in helping to resolve these problems			0
" @entity1 said the efforts are getting support from the @entity180 and @entity3			1
" we 're meeting in @entity3 because the @entity180 is trying to pass a bill right now that has a very good chance of passing that has some pretty robust sanctions			0
we 're hoping the @entity23 will do the same			0
the truth is , there is a lot of ways to attack this problem			0
" one is to do what we did with terrorist groups , which is go after the money , find where the money is			0
these guys are not buying their weapons with @entity7 pounds			0
so find their offshore accounts in @entity201 , places like that , and freeze them			0
" the other way is to actually work with @entity203 , not try to guilt them , but work with them to say , ' listen , you guys are losing 6 % of your oil import right now from the @entity7 because they 've shut off the oil			0
let 's work together to find a way to get that oil turned back on by fixing these problems			0
' " speaking to the @entity23 committee , @entity1 pointed out that the @entity7 situation is affecting global gas prices			1
" what happens in @entity7 matters very much to us now economically , " he said .			0
