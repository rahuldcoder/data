@entity0 -- @entity2 on thursday unveiled the elite group of leaders who will set the agenda for the country for the next decade , the culmination of months of secretive bargaining and a carefully choreographed performance of political pomp			1
the seven members of the powerful committee that sits atop the @entity2 system strode out onto a stage in the @entity16 in @entity0			1
they were led by @entity17 , who takes over from @entity18 as head of the @entity20 , which has ruled @entity2 for more than 60 years			1
@entity17 is joined on the new @entity21 , the party 's top decision - making body , by @entity24 , who is expected to replace @entity26 as premier early next year , and five other veteran party officials			1
although the committee 's lineup is new , analysts said it appeared to be predominantly conservative and unlikely to bring about meaningful political changes in the world 's most populous nation and second largest economy			2
@entity2 's new leaders : who 's who @entity17 also succeeded @entity18 as head of @entity2 's powerful @entity39 , which oversees major national security and military affairs			1
that makes for a cleaner transition than in the past two power handovers , when the former party chiefs held onto the key military role for years afterward , using it to keep exercising considerable power and influence			0
a far cry from the relentless media campaigns and frequent public appearances of @entity57 presidential candidates , the efforts to determine who ended up in @entity2 's most powerful posts have taken place behind closed doors , part of a once - in - a - decade leadership transition			1
the focal point of the process has been the party 's 18th @entity65 that has unfolded amid heavy security in @entity0 over the past week			2
shadow of former president looms over @entity2 's new leaders despite the spectacular economic and social changes @entity2 has undergone in recent times , the party has maintained a tight grip on power and upheld its obscure methods for selecting its top leaders			1
the consequences of the leadership handover are significant for the nation 's 1.3 billion citizens , its neighbors in @entity80 and the @entity57 , which is warily watching @entity2 's economic and military rise			1
standing in front of a huge landscape painting on thursday , @entity17 brought a touch of cordiality to the start of his speech before a packed room of reporters , apologetically acknowledging that he and his party colleagues had kept their audience waiting by appearing later than scheduled			2
but he quickly turned to serious matters , warning of the " many severe challenges " that the party faces			1
he singled out corruption , remoteness from the general public , as well as undue emphasis on formalities and bureaucracy as particular concerns			0
experts detail 5 challenges for @entity2 the secrecy and exclusivity of the procedure by which @entity2 's top leaders are selected , involving maneuvering and deal - making among senior party figures , leaves a lot of the country 's citizens feeling detached from the process			1
" many ordinary people do n't feel so excited or joyful about what 's happening , " said @entity115 , a @entity0 - based author			2
" people say , ' oh , it 's the party 's business , nothing to do with us -- and we do not have a say in selecting the leader or the policy			0
' " but @entity17 's speech had more of a human touch than many of those delivered by @entity2 officials , and he addressed subjects close to the heart of many @entity2 people and others around the world			1
" our people have great enthusiasm in life , " he said			0
" they hope for better education , more stable jobs , more satisfactory income , more reliable social security , medical services with higher standards , more comfortable living conditions and a more beautiful environment			0
" what kind of changes @entity17 , 59 , and those joining him on the party 's most powerful committee are likely to usher in over the coming years remains shrouded in mystery			1
" @entity17 is in many ways an unknown commodity , " said @entity153 , a former @entity1 correspondent and now a senior fellow at the @entity156 's @entity57 - @entity155			1
" he 's risen to the top of the @entity2 system by being very careful not to disclose what he really thinks			1
" the son of one of @entity164 's top lieutenants , @entity17 is considered a " princeling " because of his family 's place in the @entity20 aristocracy			1
he is also believed to be close to the @entity2 military			2
married to a popular folk singer for the @entity171 , he has climbed through the party hierarchy , at one point holding the top job in the eastern metropolis of @entity177			0
he is expected to inherit the title of president from @entity18 , 69 , early next year			0
some observers have expressed hope that the next decade could bring a degree of political reform as @entity2 leaders seek to bolster their legitimacy , which has been eroded by widespread corruption and the dramatic scandal this year involving the former senior party official @entity188			1
@entity2 's young talent : to stay or to go ? but many analysts are skeptical about the willingness of leaders to adopt significant changes , noting the concentration of power and money at the top of the party			1
the new set of leaders appears set to uphold the status quo , according to @entity203 , a history professor at the @entity204			0
" by and large , we have a conservative team , " @entity203 said following the announcement of the new @entity21			0
" we can expect no substantial or meaningful movement toward political reform			0
" the new leaders are likely to be " in favor of staying the course , maintaining political stability and defusing challenges to the party 's authority , " he said			1
the new @entity21 is more streamlined than its previous incarnation , dropping for nine members to seven			0
the smaller committee may help bring about greater unity and efficiency at the top of the party , some experts say			0
besides @entity17 and @entity24 , the members of the elite committee are @entity227 , @entity228 , @entity229 , @entity230 and @entity231			1
the new lineup shows that @entity233 , the 86 - year - old former party chief who preceded @entity18 , still maintains heavy clout in the @entity237 hierarchy , said @entity24 , director of research at the @entity239 at the @entity240			0
the composition of the committee is " not a surprise but a disappointment , " he said , adding that it was dominated by people loyal to @entity233			0
he said some @entity2 people would be disappointed about the decision not to include @entity249 and @entity250 , senior officials who he described as " strong advocates for political reform			2
" blind @entity2 dissident 's family bears scars the next chance to refresh the @entity21 's membership will occur in five years , when the @entity20 's next @entity65 takes place			1
for the time being , the committee remains a men 's club with no woman among its new members			0
since the @entity21 's creation in 1949 , no woman has ever held a position on it			0
despite speculation that @entity269 , the lone female member of the wider @entity21 , might be tapped for the elite group , she was not among the seven members who marched across the stage thursday			1
her age may have been a disadvantage in her candidacy , according to the @entity276 , which is based at @entity277			0
@entity249 was born in 1945 and has been a member of the @entity21 since 2007			0
women lag in political representation in @entity2			2
only 2.2 % of working women were in charge of the state offices , party organizations and other enterprises or institutions , according to the @entity287 on @entity289 's @entity288 , a national survey released last year			0
the number of women on the 25 - member @entity21 has increased , though , from one to two : @entity291 , the party secretary of @entity293 province , joins @entity249 , who was already a member			0
the reaction from @entity2 's neighbors to the unveiling of the new leadership reflected its complicated relationships in the @entity299			1
@entity300 , which is locked in a tense territorial dispute with @entity2 over a group of small islands in the @entity304 , said it hoped " the mutually beneficial relationship based on common strategic interest will be further developed and enhanced with the new leadership			2
" @entity307 , the young leader of @entity308 , sent a message congratulating @entity17 on his new position , according to the state - run @entity311			2
@entity307 's message stressed the long " friendship " between the two countries			0
@entity2 is the reclusive @entity308 regime 's main ally , providing it with vital economic support			2
n. @entity308 defectors ' faint hope for @entity2 @entity1 's @entity319 reported from @entity0 , and @entity320 from @entity321			2
@entity233 and @entity322 in @entity0 , and @entity323 , @entity324 , @entity325 and @entity326 in @entity321 contributed to this report .			0
