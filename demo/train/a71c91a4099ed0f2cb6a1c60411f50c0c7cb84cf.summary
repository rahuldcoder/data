-- the federal government has shut down for the first time since 1996 and all eyes are focused on house speaker @entity4			1
will he continue to insist upon tying a repeal or delay of @entity7 to a funding bill ? or will he bring the @entity10 - passed funding bill to the @entity12 floor and hope that he can convince 17 republicans to join hands with the chamber 's 200 @entity15 and vote to re-open the federal government ? it all depends on whether he chooses to follow or ignore the @entity19			1
the choice is n't an easy one , as his speakership quite likely hangs in the balance			2
the @entity19 is named after former speaker @entity24 , who did not bring bills to the floor unless those bills were supported by a majority of @entity12 republicans			1
it is not a formal rule , but rather a promise to uphold the will of a majority of the majority			0
@entity12 @entity29 expected @entity4 to uphold the rule and he pledged to do so			1
but the shutdown and the upcoming showdown over raising the debt limit underscore @entity4 's leadership dilemma -- almost any bill that a majority of @entity12 @entity29 support is dead on arrival in the @entity43 - controlled @entity10			1
fewer laws were passed in the last @entity44 than in any @entity44 since 1861 , and based on the number of floor votes taken so far this year , the current @entity44 is on track to be even less productive			0
it is also the most partisan @entity44 since the @entity51 era			0
as the shutdown gets under way , many are looking for signs of what kind of leader @entity4 will be			2
instead , they should consider what kind of leader he can be , given the political hand he 's been dealt			0
gone are the days of @entity12 speakers plying members with promises of pork and campaign money			2
earmarks have been banned , most incumbents do their own fundraising , and for many of the chamber 's newer members , ideology trumps party loyalty			0
the electoral landscape does n't help			0
in 1995 - 96 , when the federal government last shut down , 34 % of @entity76 represented districts that @entity79 won in 1992			1
today , just 7 % of @entity12 @entity29 come from districts that president @entity81 won last year			2
there is almost no electoral incentive for these members to compromise			0
the bottom line is that @entity4 's arsenal is limited			0
he is hamstrung by the very institution and members he is supposed to lead			0
so what are @entity4 's options at this point ? he could , as he has done previously , pass a funding bill on the backs of @entity15			1
the 2011 and 2012 omnibus spending bills , the @entity95 , and the 2012 @entity96 all passed the @entity12 because of @entity43 support			0
and earlier this year , @entity4 brought the @entity98 and the @entity100 bill to the floor , despite opposition from a majority of @entity12 republicans			1
these bills had bipartisan support in the @entity10 , making it difficult for @entity4 to dig his heels in and stand behind his conservative majority			2
what is the @entity12 speaker 's calculus , given that the @entity10 passed its funding bill on a party - line vote ? absent the pressure to appease @entity118 senators , @entity4 will have a tough time justifying any move to defy the will of his party 's majority			1
convincing @entity12 @entity29 to pass the @entity10 's funding bill and re-open the federal government will require him to lead in a way that may not be possible , should he wish to remain speaker			1
no @entity12 speaker wants to go down in history for a legislative record opposed by the majority of his or her own party			1
and no speaker wants to go down in history for presiding over one of the most unproductive congresses in history			0
but these are @entity4 's choices			2
while @entity24 relied on a majority of the majority , @entity4 has had to rely on a minority of the majority , together with a majority of the minority , to pass important legislation			1
the " @entity150 " is hardly the stuff to which great leaders aspire			0
it may , however , prove more productive than following the lead of his majority			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity156 and @entity157 .			2

the federal government has shut down for the first time since 1996
@entity156 , @entity157 : what will @entity12 speaker @entity4 do ?
they say as @entity4 faces tough choices , his @entity165 hangs in the balance
@entity156 , @entity157 : will he rely on a minority of the majority of his party to pass bill ?
