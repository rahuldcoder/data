-- @entity1 dreamed of capturing life through her camera lens			2
@entity1 had her sights set on being a photographer as she graduated with a bachelor of fine arts degree from @entity8 in december			2
but the 23 - year - old is not working as a photographer			1
she 's at a concession stand , selling popcorn or ushering people into their respective theaters before the midnight screening			1
@entity1 's been working part - time at the same @entity18 movie theater since 2005			1
" it 's going on to be eight years of this , " she said			2
but working part - time at a movie theater was not what she saw herself doing with her degree , and she is not alone			1
last month 's surprising drop in @entity27 unemployment rates from 8.2 % to 7.8 % gave many hopes that the economy is improving , and the lower rates even beat the expectations of some economists			1
but a breakdown of the latest jobs report shows that more than half of the jobs added this month are part - time			1
this leaves people like @entity1 wondering : is the new @entity27 job part - time ? from law dreams to data - entry every day , @entity43 holds her breath as she walks into the @entity46 bank where she works part - time doing data entry			1
it 's a temporary position , and she 's heard her boss say time and time again that there might not be a job for her one of these days			1
" there was someone at my job who was working for only three weeks , and she came in one day and did n't have a job			1
it 's nerve - wracking , " she said			1
the insecurity of her part - time job is one reason behind the mounting stress facing the 27 - year - old , who graduated from @entity67 in 2010 with a degree in political science			1
@entity73 , like many adults her age , has student loans along with a laundry list of other bills she needs to pay			2
she lives with her mom to offset her expenses and started working as a film and television extra on the side to supplement the part - time pay she makes at the bank			1
this month , she is going to be an extra on a @entity46 - based television show , acting as a housekeeper			1
it 's quite a departure from her dreams of becoming a lawyer			2
but she says those dreams are not realistic anymore when she thinks about the average cost of higher education			2
" law school 's like , what , $ 75,000 ? i ca n't afford that			2
i tried looking for a paralegal job , but i could n't find anything , " she said			2
" i feel like we are the confused generation , " @entity73 said			0
" my mom was 24 when she got her own house and had my sister			0
both my parents had jobs then , here in @entity27			1
when i think about that , i think to myself , ' wow , i do n't have any of that			0
' " it frustrates @entity73 to compare herself with her mother , who for the past 26 years has worked at a @entity46 factory to support their family			2
" i thought i would get a better job than her because i have a degree			0
i never thought i would make less than my mom , " she said			0
still , she is grateful about her situation when she thinks about friends who are unemployed			0
she 's persistent in applying for jobs and is willing to work random part - time jobs to help pay off her bills and loans			1
" if you want to keep yourself from being homeless , do n't be picky with jobs , " she advised			2
from corporate suit to story reader when @entity129 saw the " hatchet man " at her corporate job at a @entity132 mobile company one morning in 2008 , she knew that someone was getting the ax			0
little did she know that it would fall on her and her entire quality service department			0
she was shocked and mainly hurt to see her co-workers break down in tears when they got the news of their termination			0
unlike them , she was financially stable even with the loss of her job , relying on her husband with a full - time job and the money she 'd saved when she was working			1
but after using up her severance package , she decided she needed to do more			0
so when she came across an ad in her local paper for a job as a story reader , she considered the idea			0
" i thought it was really interesting , " she said			0
" i have a son , and when i read to him , i would do the voices and make each character sound different and use an inflection in my voice , so i thought to myself , ' i can do this			0
' " now , she works part - time reading to young children who attend at - risk schools and other learning programs			1
@entity129 spends her mornings using creative methods to tell stories to children			0
" we are trying to teach kids to love reading and love books , " she said			0
@entity129 says she finds deeper fulfillment now with her part - time job as a story reader , but she remains realistic about its ability to sustain her financially			1
" this job would not be enough support my family solely , " she said			2
losing her corporate job helped her realize she wanted to spend her time differently			2
" i am happy in the way my life is going right now			0
my son is in grad school , and my husband 's job is pretty secure , " she said			0
but she knows that if she did not have her savings and her husband 's income to fall back on , she would have problems			0
" the quality of my life improved because i have more time for my family			2
but the drawbacks to a part - time job are no benefits and no insurance , " she said			1
radio station worker turns entrepreneur with more than 30 years of radio experience , @entity199 could do practically every job in his @entity203 building			0
despite his years of experience , his varying skills sets and his degrees in mass media and broadcast meteorology , he lost his job			0
" i was disappointed at losing the ' big money , ' " he said			0
" but i was also excited about the new prospects of starting my own station and not having to answer to anyone but myself			0
" he took his job loss as an opportunity and decided to create his own internet radio station , @entity217 , tapping into the smooth jazz genre that he knew had a long tradition in the @entity221 market			1
@entity217 is just one of three part - time jobs he works , and he admits he was making a lot more when he was working full - time with a radio station			1
" i see great possibilities with internet radio and an opportunity to make even more than my previous full - time job , " he said			1
" it will just take several more years to achieve it			0
" he does think the economy was a factor in losing his full - time job , and he says he did not expect to see himself working three part - time jobs at the age of 50			1
" i thought i 'd be full - time in radio due to my large skill set			1
however , i learned that economics rules , " he said			0
from photography student to movie theater worker @entity1 , the part - time movie theater employee , knows that the economy is directly affecting her employment situation			1
" the majority of my friends are in the same boat as me , " she said , explaining that many of them work part - time jobs as babysitters and restaurant workers			1
but she continues to apply for jobs every day			2
" i feel like , if i stop looking , i would n't be as happy , because i will just be settling for something i do n't want , " she said			0
her new husband , who worked part - time for several months at a furniture store , finally got offered two full - time jobs			1
she says that definitely gives her hope , and she has not given up on the idea of heading back to school to continue studying art and photography			0
" overall , i 'm happy , " she said			0
" i 'm a positive person , and if i 'm at a movie theater for another year , i 'll survive			0

more than half new jobs created for the month of *september* were part - time jobs
many @entity27 are working several part - time jobs to support themselves
part - time employees usually do not receive benefits or insurance
some people have turned the loss of full - time employment into a *career* opportunity
