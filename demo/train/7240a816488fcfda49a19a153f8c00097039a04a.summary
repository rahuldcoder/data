-- an estranged son of anti-gay @entity3 pastor @entity2 said wednesday that the spiritual leader of @entity5 hit his wife and beat his children with a mattock handle until they bled			1
" i think what he does out there is evil , " said @entity9 , during an appearance on @entity13 's " issues with @entity12			1
" @entity9 is the seventh of the @entity5 minister 's 13 children			1
the younger @entity19 severed ties with his family on his 18th birthday and said he has n't had contact with his father in three decades			2
@entity9 is currently writing a book about his family			1
the @entity27 @entity26 ruled earlier this month that @entity5 's practice of picketing the funerals of fallen soldiers with offensive placards is constitutionally protected free speech			1
the picketing , which includes chants and placards stating " @entity5 " and " thank @entity35 for @entity36 , " have enraged supporters of the @entity27 military and the families and friends of slain soldiers			1
@entity9 called his pastor father " one of the best reasons that @entity27 has been forced to get off the fence and address this issue ( of gay rights )			1
" " but at the same time you ca n't ignore the fact that he 's done a lot of damage , " @entity19 said			0
" he 's hurt a lot of families , not only in the gay community , but the families of these soldiers			0
" the younger @entity19 said his father also hurt his own family			2
" he used his fists			0
he used his knees and he used ... the handle of a mattock , " said @entity19 , referring to a pick - like digging tool			1
" he used that in such a way that it split the skin on the back of the kid 's legs so they bled			0
" " if they want to call that discipline , that 's fine			0
but i call it abuse , " @entity19 said			0
the son said @entity2 also hit his mother , but not with the handle of the mattock			1
@entity19 has also said his father abused prescription drugs when he was in law school			2
he did n't back down from the claim during the @entity13 interview			0
@entity12 read a statement from @entity9 ' sister , @entity83 , denying the claim			1
hell no. his ( @entity9 ' ) imagination goes on and on , " @entity83 wrote			1
" this lie should not have come out of his mouth when he decided to reject the word of @entity35			0
nothing he can say will change the fact that @entity35 hates ( homosexuals ) and their enablers and therefore @entity35 hates @entity27 and @entity27 is doomed			0
" @entity9 responded that his sister " just cynically lies about what happened			2
" likewise , @entity19 said his father manipulates facts and circumstances to reach false conclusions			2
" my father can make any connection to anything that anyone has done or has n't done in their life and point to that to say that that 's evidence they 're damned and going to hell , " @entity19 said			2
" he 's convinced that homosexuality is the ultimate sin against @entity35			0
" so since the @entity27 is taking steps to move in the direction of equality for gays in @entity27 , he says that has doomed @entity27 , " @entity19 said			0
" so anyone who is connected to @entity27 , so anyone who is supporting @entity27 in any sense is subject to the wrath of @entity35			0
" when asked what he would say to his father if he could , @entity9 replied , " i 've never had a relationship with my father			1
i would n't know what to say to him			0
" there was no immediate public response from @entity2 to his son 's televised remarks .			2
