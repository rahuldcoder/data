editor 's note : a nationally syndicated columnist , @entity2 is the author of " listening to the @entity4 " and " speak , @entity5 ! a @entity7 's view of @entity8			1
" visit his web site for more information			0
@entity2 says it 's time to get over the fact that baseball turned a blind eye to steroid use			1
( @entity16 ) -- i loved baseball as a kid			1
i still have fond memories of my siblings and me , members of the " @entity24 " club , heading to the @entity25 , the eighth wonder of the world , to watch the @entity28 play			0
i played the game in elementary and high school			0
but now , i 'm sick of it , especially when steroids are brought up			0
the latest baseball drama surrounds a @entity35 report quoting two lawyers who say that former @entity39 slugger @entity38 's name was on a list of players who tested positive for an illegal substance in 2003			1
the list supposedly contains more than 100 names of players who tested positive that year			0
this report comes on the heels of @entity47 of the @entity48 admitting that he used performance - enhancing drugs a few years ago ; @entity50 testing positive and suspended for 50 games ; and the continuing drama surrounding @entity53			1
all three were considered locks for the @entity55			0
but based on what we keep hearing , that 'll never happen in this holier - than - thou era			1
baseball had a terrible drug problem			1
now they have a drug testing plan in place that has some teeth in it			2
so , can we just move the hell on ? seriously , i 'm tired of rehashing the drama			0
as a sports enthusiast , i would love nothing better than to think that athletes in baseball , football , basketball or any other sport are as pure as heroes from yesteryear			2
it has been around from @entity84 , and if a player thinks he can get an edge , well , it 's a good bet some will try to get it			2
@entity38 has always been suspected of using drugs , but now that two lawyers say they saw his name on the infamous sheet , he has gone , according to @entity92 's column in the @entity93 , " from hero to zero			1
" but you know what ? i do n't care			0
can we just all accept the fact that all of baseball -- players , management , owners , the unions -- turned a blind eye to performance - enhancing drugs ravaging the sport ? and they did so because baseball was on its way to being comparable to the @entity111 or soccer in the @entity8 -- irrelevant to sports fans			1
after the strike in 1994 wiped out the @entity116 , fans were angry and did n't give a lick about the sport			0
but then came 1998 and the home - run derby put on by @entity120 cardinal @entity119 and @entity38 , both trying to break the record of 61 homers in a year set by @entity124 of the @entity48			1
fans were riveted by the hitting prowess of the two , and people were following their every at - bat			2
i was working at @entity130 in @entity131 , @entity132 , that summer , and we would break into programming to broadcast the call of their at - bats when they were about to break the record			1
@entity141 , everyone had @entity143 fever			0
the players redeemed themselves , management was happy to say they worked for the sport , and the owners were delirious because the money came rolling in			0
so there we have it			0
all of baseball pulled a @entity153 , as in the legend of the classic blues singer who supposedly got his gift for music by making a pact with the devil			1
or maybe more like @entity160			0
the sport turned in its integrity for a few pieces of silver			0
let 's just accept this as a fact , acknowledge those were the dark days and move on			2
it 's just tiring to keep going back to what happened then			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			1

@entity2 : baseball was in the *doldrums* until 1998 home - run race
@entity2 : @entity119 - @entity38 race to break home - run record *stirred* *interest*
@entity2 says baseball had a terrible drug problem
but he says it 's time to turn the page on baseball 's deal with devil
