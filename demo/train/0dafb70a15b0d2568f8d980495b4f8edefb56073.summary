-- @entity3 's @entity2 rovers are celebrating their fifth birthday on the @entity2 , exceeding their original life span by four years and nine months , with no end in sight to their history - making work			1
@entity9 captured this stunning view as the sun sank below the rim of @entity13 on @entity2 in 2005			1
the rover spirit landed january 3 , 2004 , with @entity15 touching down 21 days later			0
@entity3 said the rovers had made important discoveries about the wet and violent conditions on ancient @entity2			1
they had returned 250,000 images , covered more than 21 kilometers ( 13 miles ) , climbed a mountain , descended into craters , struggled with sand traps and ageing hardware and survived dust storms , @entity3 said			1
" these rovers are incredibly resilient considering the extreme environment the hardware experiences every day , " said @entity25 , @entity26 project manager for @entity27			1
" we realize that a major rover component on either vehicle could fail at any time and end a mission with no advance notice , but on the other hand , we could accomplish the equivalent duration of four more prime missions on each rover in the year ahead			0
" martian winds had helped clean dust from the rovers			2
however , @entity3 said that @entity9 had not had a good clean for more than 18 months and that its dust - coated solar panels barely provided enough power to get it through its third winter , which ended in december			1
" this last winter was a squeaker for @entity9 , " @entity25 said			0
but with spring and summer bringing more power , @entity3 planned to move @entity9 to two new sites : a mound and a house - sized pit called @entity50			2
" @entity50 does n't look like an impact crater , " said @entity51 of @entity52 , a principal investigator on the rover project			0
" we suspect it might be a volcanic explosion crater , and that 's something we have n't seen before			2
" opportunity , meanwhile , is to be moved to @entity61			0
at approximately 22 kilometers ( 14 miles ) in diameter it is more than 20 times larger than another impact crater , @entity65 , where the rover spent most of the past two years , @entity3 said			1
@entity61 is about 12 kilometers ( 7 miles ) from @entity65 , but @entity15 will take a longer route to avoid major obstacles			0
it has already covered about 2 kilometers of the journey			0
high - resolution images from @entity3 's @entity72 , which reached @entity2 in 2006 , are helping the team plot routes			1
" we keep setting the bar higher for what these rovers can do , " said @entity74 , a @entity26 rover driver			0
" once , it seemed like a crazy idea to go to @entity61 , but now we 're doing it			0
" @entity51 said the journeys had been motivated by science but had led to something else important			0
" this has turned into humanity 's first overland expedition on another planet			2
when people look back on this period of @entity2 exploration decades from now , @entity27 may be considered most significant not for the science they accomplished but for the first time we truly went exploring across the surface of @entity2			1

@entity3 's @entity2 rovers are celebrating their fifth birthday on the @entity2
@entity27 have exceeded their expected life by 4 years , 9 months
pair are still rolling around the planet 's surface , conducting *experiments*
