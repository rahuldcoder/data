-- in the end , it was all too familiar			0
@entity4 went out , @entity3 went through -- same story , different season			1
for all the talk of @entity4 being able to emulate last season 's famous victory at the @entity11 , there was one thing sorely lacking			1
that it managed to secure a 1 - 1 draw will provide some comfort to manager @entity17 , whose club has gone nine years without winning a trophy			1
a 3 - 1 aggregate defeat means @entity4 will now have to shift its focus to the @entity22 and @entity23 while @entity3 continues its quest to dominate this competition			1
last year , @entity4 arrived in @entity26 trailing 3 - 1 after a first leg where it had been taught a footballing lesson by the @entity31 giant			1
on that occasion , written off by every football expert on the planet , it produced one of its finest performances of recent times to win 2 - 0 only to exit the competition on away goals			0
a year on , @entity4 once again walked into the cauldron facing a two - goal deficit against a @entity3 team 20 points clear at the top of the @entity45 and determined to become the first club to successfully defend the @entity48 title			1
@entity17 's side , without several injured players including @entity50 and @entity51 as well as the suspended @entity52 , was always going to find the going tough			0
after a rather turgid first half where neither side really managed to find its rhythm , the game exploded into life nine minutes after the interval			0
@entity3 broke down the right and when @entity4 failed to cut out @entity63 's cross , @entity61 took advantage by firing home from close range			1
that should have seen @entity3 out of sight , but @entity4 had other ideas			1
@entity70 , once of @entity3 , chased down @entity71 and after the defender stumbled under pressure , the @entity4 forward took possession and rifled the ball past @entity76			1
that signaled a period of @entity4 pressure but while the visiting side found extra space going forward , it was unable to make the breakthrough			1
it was @entity3 which should have won the tie in stoppage time when @entity87 went down in the penalty area under the challenge of @entity90			1
@entity91 stood up to take the spot kick but his effort was parried by @entity94 , who then beat the @entity3 forward to the loose ball			2
not that it mattered to @entity3 though , which qualified for the last eight for the 13th time			2
" on the day 2 - 0 was n't the best result in the first leg but we still had a chance to give it our all and to get a result , " @entity4 midfielder @entity99 told @entity100			1
" @entity3 has weaknesses like any other team and when you score anyone can get nervous			2
when we did that we thought we had a chance but we just could n't do it			0
" maybe we lacked a bit of quality with the final ball			0
at the top level you need that			0
the boys put in a great shift but we can be proud of our efforts			0
" @entity4 's misery was compounded by an injury to record signing @entity122 , who was withdrawn at halftime with a hamstring problem			2
in the night 's other game , @entity125 sealed its place in the quarterfinals for the first time in 17 years following a 5 - 1 aggregate victory over seven - time champion @entity131			1
leading 1 - 0 from the first leg , @entity125 , second in in @entity135 , took a third minute lead through the prolific @entity137 on its way to a 4 - 1 win win			1
@entity131 equalized courtesy of former @entity142 star @entity141 but further goals from @entity144 , @entity145 and @entity137 's second sealed the win			2
" we are grateful for the support of the fans , and the truth is that the team deserves congratulating for the way it has played , " @entity137 told @entity148 television			0
" we have done ourselves proud			0
all teams who reach the quarterfinals are very good			0
for now we 'll just enjoy			0
" manager @entity158 was part of the last @entity125 side which reached the quarterfinals of the @entity48 in 1997			1
here , he watched on as his team cruised past a troubled @entity131 team which has struggled so badly in @entity164 this season			2
@entity131 's defeat means there will be no @entity169 club in the last eight of the competition for the first time since 2009			2
@entity137 , who made his debut for @entity174 last week , was the hero at the @entity175 in the first leg and once again it was he who tormented @entity131			0
his spectacular opener set the home side on its way and even when @entity141 leveled , @entity125 refused to buckle			0
@entity144 netted a classy second before @entity145 headed home @entity184 's cross to give his side a two - goal cushion			0
@entity137 then wrapped up the win late on with his seventh goal in five @entity48 games .			0

@entity3 through to last eight of the @entity48
@entity3 held to 1 - 1 draw by @entity4 but *progresses* 3 - 1 on aggregate
@entity125 seals place in quarterfinals following @entity131 victory
@entity125 won 4 - 1 on the night and 5 - 1 on aggregate
