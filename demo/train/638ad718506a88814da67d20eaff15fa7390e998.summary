-- it 's a problem which is there in black and white			1
there are 92 professional clubs in the @entity5 -- but just two of those are led by black managers and according to the latest @entity10 report , while there are only 15 black or ethnic minority coaches working across the professional game			1
it is a damning statistic which shames @entity16 football and the @entity10 's chairman @entity17 says that must change with the @entity10 currently discussing the merits of the @entity20 rule which is used in the @entity21 as a way of bringing more black or ethnic minorities into the sport			1
@entity26 manager @entity25 recently said " there is no racism in football " but @entity17 , who took over from @entity29 in july 2013 , is concerned about minority representation saying @entity16 football must implement its own @entity20 rule			2
" it has to happen , " @entity17 , chairman of the @entity10 told @entity0 , referring to the rule , which was introduced in the @entity34 states to ensure teams should interview at least one black of ethnic minority candidate			1
in the @entity34 the number of black assistant coaches working in @entity21 rose from 14 in 1980 to 199 out of 610 in 2012 -- a rise of 32.6 %			2
some 25 years ago , there was only one black head coach , @entity42 , who managed the @entity43 , while now there are currently four with @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 and @entity48 all leading the way			2
but @entity16 football has not progressed with one former player , @entity50 , complaining that he would have to move abroad to pursue coaching opportunities because of the " archaic " attitudes towards black coaches			1
" you go anywhere in the country to watch football now and there 's a disproportionate amount of ethnic minorities and yet why are they not coming through the game ? " pondered @entity17			1
" we 've got an inclusion group looking at whether the @entity63 would work			0
we apply the @entity63 when we 're applying for coaches			0
you need to know it 's going to work			0
" @entity68 , the former @entity69 and @entity70 defender , has advocated such a system and @entity17 , has not discounted it			1
" there 's no point saying if you 're going to interview five people with one from an ethnic minority if they 're never going to get the job , " he added			0
you need to know it 's going to work which is why you have to get more coaches through			2
" the lack of leading @entity84 , @entity85 and minority ethnic ( @entity87 ) coaches working in @entity16 football is just one problem facing @entity17 and his commission			1
lagging behind @entity91 rivals by the sound of it @entity16 football is effectively broken			2
according to the latest report , there are only 205 @entity16 coaches with a @entity98 pro-licence , the top qualification , compared to 2,353 in @entity100 and 1,304 in @entity101			0
even lower down the ranking , @entity102 boasts 37,742 coaches with a ' b ' licence compared to just 9,548 in @entity70 -- the lowest out of the five top leagues in @entity91			1
while the @entity10 says there are 50,000 coaches active in @entity70 , 39,000 of those do not possess qualifications above the @entity110 3 -- the level below the ' b ' licence			1
" we 're miles behind , miles behind , " said @entity17 when commenting on coaching			1
" we 're miles behind on coaching and facilities			0
can we catch up ? yes , but it will take five or 10 years			0
" the latest proposals would involve the @entity10 set up a coach education organization which will be led by a new head of education who will sit on the governing body 's executive			1
the @entity10 plans to build ' football hubs ' in 30 different cities across @entity70 including @entity127 , @entity128 , @entity129 , @entity130 and @entity131 with £ 230 million being invested in the project over the next five years , though bear in mind the @entity133 @entity10 is plowing € 1 billion ( $ 1.3 billion ) into their domestic game every year			1
the hubs will boast state of the art facilities including @entity140 artificial pitches which are widely used across @entity91 with @entity101 boasting 3,735 such surfaces compared to just 639 in @entity70			1
@entity70 has one synthetic pitch for every 42,000 people according to the @entity10 report , while the @entity133 has one for every 13,000 -- a significant advantage for the development of young players			1
each hub will also have floodlights , changing rooms , a classroom and changing facilities all of which will be cared for by a local body			0
there are also plans in place to increase those holding the very top coaching qualification to 300 , while taking the number of @entity110 @entity161 coaches from 800 to 3,000			0
" one of the criteria when we are setting up these coaching courses is that we want to get more people through it so we get more coaches , " said @entity17			1
" it 's their job to analyze the constraints why people are n't coming			0
is it that there is n't enough supply ? is it cost ? time ? " if you 're an @entity181 footballer then cost does n't matter			0
therefore do you approach it by reducing the cost or by putting aside a fund for those who ca n't afford it ? " leagues apart while the @entity10 counts every penny in its budget , the @entity189 posted revenues of over £ 3 billion ( $ 4.8 billion ) last june , according to financial analysts @entity193			1
the @entity189 has already secured a domestic television deal worth over £ 3 billion which lasts until the end of the 2016 season , while foreign broadcasters have paid £ 2.3 billion for the same period			2
but have those riches damaged the @entity16 game with young domestic talent often not being the opportunity to shine with big money being spent on overseas stars ? according to the latest figures from the @entity10 , @entity189 starts made by @entity16 players were recorded at just 32 % , while the figure for those at the top six clubs have decreased from 28 % to 25 %			1
that figure was at 69 % two decades ago			0
during the last transfer window , which ended on august 31 , @entity189 club spent a record £ 835 million on players			2
the drought of young @entity16 talent has had a knock on effect with the national team suffering with the country not having reached the semifinals of a major tournament since 1996			2
speaking at the @entity224 in @entity127 earlier this week , @entity222 , the chief executive of the @entity101 @entity223 , said the sheer amount of money within the @entity189 was having a negative effect on player development			2
he said : " if you have so much money compared to us ... and you can afford nearly every player around the world , how motivated are you to put the cards on young players who need one or two years ? " @entity222 claims that the success of the @entity101 national team , which came following a through review of the country 's failings during the dire 2000 @entity242 campaign , benefited from the relationship with the nation 's @entity10 and the @entity223			1
@entity17 concedes that the @entity10 can not help transform the fortunes of @entity16 football alone -- he knows that without the cooperation of the @entity189 , @entity70 could remain in the international wilderness without a supply line of fresh , young talent			1
" the trouble is that because we 're the richest league in the world , they 've got enough money not to worry about bringing kids through , " said @entity17			2
" the average @entity189 manager reign lasts a year			0
so , he 's not going to do think about the five - year development , he 's going to think about how to save his job			0
" he can save his job by going to @entity259 and buying a 22 - year - old who has already played 200 games at a decent level			0
" no we ca n't do it without the @entity189 , but the @entity189 and the clubs recognize the issue			0
" at some stage , some of the owners of the clubs are going to say , ' i 'm spending six or seven million on an academy and getting nothing out of it			0
" it needs money and they 've got money			0
i think they 'll contribute as long as other people contribute			0
