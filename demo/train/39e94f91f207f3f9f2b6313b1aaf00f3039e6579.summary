@entity18 circuit judge @entity17 sentenced him to two concurrent life terms , saying , " this craven act is n't who we are			1

there is no excuse , " @entity17 said			2
he added , " the state of @entity2 condemns this despicable crime			2
" @entity31 , 19 , told the judge that he was a " changed man " who had found religion since his arrest			1
" i wish i could take it all back , " he said , adding , " i was young and dumb , ignorant and full of hatred			1
i chose to go down the wrong path			2
" @entity31 is also expected to plead guilty to still - undisclosed federal charges thursday , three sources with knowledge of the case told @entity0 -- the first indication that a federal case was pending in @entity46 's death			1
officials would disclose no details , but @entity18 district attorney @entity49 said he expected other charges -- and other arrests			1
" this is just the beginning , " @entity49 said			0
@entity46 's killing prompted several large marches and prayer vigils in @entity15 , a city of about 537,000 people			2
his sister , @entity58 , said during wednesday 's hearing that her family was praying for " racial conciliation			1
" " these last months have been very difficult , " @entity62 said			0

@entity64 was a big - hearted person who loved his fellow man			0
" @entity46 died after he was beaten and run over by a truck driven by @entity31 , according to police			1
@entity31 was part of a group of seven white youths from largely white @entity74 who decided to " go f * * k with some niggers , " after a night of partying and drinking , law enforcement officials have said , quoting some of the suspects in the case			1
@entity49 has said the evidence indicated the suspects , who ranged in age from 17 to 19 , " went out with the intention to harm and , in this case , kill a black man			0
" according to investigators , they drove 16 miles in two vehicles from @entity74 to @entity15 , where after exiting the highway , they found @entity46 alone in a parking lot about 4 a.m. on june 26			0
the white men allegedly beat @entity46 repeatedly , yelling racial epithets			2
after the beating , @entity31 drove his @entity96 truck over him , leaving him to die , according to what some of the teens cooperating with police have told authorities			1
@entity46 's death drew national attention after @entity0 first reported it and aired exclusive surveillance video of the killing , captured by a parking lot security camera in a @entity15 suburb			2
a second man , @entity107 , was initially charged with murder , but a judge reduced the charges to simple assault because @entity107 was not believed to be driving the vehicle used to kill @entity46			2
for months , lawyers had been working behind the scenes in @entity15 , where @entity31 is being held , fighting over a change of venue in a possible trial			1

but defense attorneys wanted to move the trial to an area with a larger white population , the law enforcement officials said			0
murder suspect carried ' backpack of hatred ' authorities believe @entity31 led and instigated the attack			1
on a sweltering @entity2 night in june , a gang of youths climbed into @entity31 's green truck and a white suv and drove to the western edge of @entity15			1
they would have seen @entity46 immediately as they exited the highway , officials said			0
he was standing in a hotel parking lot just beyond the exit ramp			0
on the videotape obtained exclusively by @entity0 , the group pulls into the parking lot and stops where @entity46 is standing , although he is just off camera and not visible			0
the young men can then be seen going back and forth between their cars and @entity46			0
witnesses told authorities this is when @entity46 's beating took place , as the white youths yelled racial epithets , including " white power			1
" authorities allege @entity31 and many of the other teens pummeled @entity46 repeatedly as he crumpled to the ground , although this is not visible on the tape			1
after the beating , some of the white youths left , and others got into the green @entity96 truck			0
at this moment , @entity46 becomes visible on the tape as he staggers into view and walked toward the truck			0
" @entity31 drove the @entity96 out of the parking lot and turned right onto @entity167 , " the lawsuit says			1
" just as @entity31 turned right , his headlights shone directly on @entity46 , who , having been severely beaten , was stumbling in a grassy area near the motel 's entrance			1
@entity31 accelerated , drove onto and over the street curb , and struck @entity46 with the front of the @entity96			2
" shortly afterward , @entity31 allegedly boasted and laughed about the killing , according to statements some of the teens made to detectives			2
" i ran that nigger over , " he allegedly said in a phone conversation to the youths in the other car			0
" he was not remorseful , " @entity49 said			0
" he was laughing , laughing about the killing			0
" but during a bail hearing last year , @entity31 's attorney told the court he saw nothing to back up the " racial allegations			1
" the @entity187 had been looking into the death as a possible federal hate crime and assisting local prosecutors			0
federal investigators also have been digging for months into other possible crimes in the area committed by @entity31 and others that might show a pattern of racial violence			1
@entity46 's family had asked state and federal officials not to seek the death penalty against @entity31 or any other youths who might be charged in the case , saying they oppose capital punishment in part because of their religious faith			1
the family also filed a wrongful death suit against all seven of the white youths who were present at the beating of @entity46			2
