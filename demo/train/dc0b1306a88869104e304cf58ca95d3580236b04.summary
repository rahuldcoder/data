one of the strangest right - wing conspiracies is that @entity2 is not really a @entity3			1
it 's strange because the president has missed few opportunities to inject @entity7 into his rhetoric -- to an extent that really ought to irritate his more radical liberal allies			2
yet all his talk about being " brought to @entity12 " has done little to bring conservatives to him			0
on the contrary , this week they responded to @entity2 's remarks at the @entity17 with righteous anger			1
the president used the occasion to warn against the distortion of faith for the sake of promoting violence			1
few would disagree with that , but @entity2 upped the stakes by reminding the audience that @entity3 could be just as guilty of this as @entity29 -- name - dropping the @entity30 , @entity31 and @entity32 as examples			1
the president urged listeners to recognize the role that doubt can play in faith , embracing humility and rejecting the idea that " somehow we alone are in possession of the truth			2
" " the president 's comments this morning at the prayer breakfast are the most offensive i 've ever heard a president make in my lifetime , " said @entity42 , former @entity43 governor of @entity44			1
" @entity2 is not , in any meaningful way , a @entity3 , " wrote @entity50 at @entity51			1
" @entity12 himself is truth			0
when we possess @entity12 , we possess truth			0
the president is a moral relativist			2
" i am reminded of @entity61 's reporting of an imaginary speech in which @entity2 urges the @entity63 to " destroy @entity64 and usher in a new age of liberal darkness that shall reign o'er the @entity67 for a thousand years			1
" no , @entity2 is not the anti-christ			2
but conservative @entity3 skepticism about his religion is justifiable			2
from the perspective of the religious right , his faith is contradicted by his policies : how can a @entity3 support same - sex marriage or say " thank you , @entity78			1
@entity79 bless you " when it is an organization that provides abortion services ? if his rejection of natural law infuriates @entity86 , some conservatives have identified a lack of commitment to the principle of @entity91 exceptionalism and , therefore , to its associated dream of building " a shining city upon a hill			0
" if you believe that @entity79 intervenes directly in the lives of individuals and nations ( as did @entity99 ) , then the blessings enjoyed by the @entity91 are not an accident but providence			0
hence , @entity2 's suggestion earlier in his presidency that exceptionalism is not necessarily exceptional to @entity91 , validates the accusation that , in the words of @entity42 , he " does not believe in @entity91 or the values we all share			1
" just as controversial are the president 's claims that one does not necessarily achieve salvation through @entity12 alone ( that there is more than one " path to grace " ) or that @entity7 is stained by some sort of historical sin of political manipulation			0
but if @entity2 contradicts one faith tradition in @entity91 , he is in tune with another			1
there is a modernist , post- ' 60s brand of @entity7 that places an emphasis upon man as broken and in need of healing			0
this is a difficult process because , i and others would argue , that part of our " broken state " involves being disconnected from @entity79 , and it 's this disconnection that leads to sin			0
said the president at the breakfast : " we should assume humbly that we 're confused and do n't always know what we 're doing and we 're staggering and stumbling towards [ @entity79 ] , and have some humility in that process			2
" by acknowledging what we do n't know about @entity79 and focusing upon improving our human relationships here on @entity67 , says the modernist @entity3 , we become fuller human beings and fuller @entity3			2
perhaps we can be redeemed through social action , while our understanding of the truth begins by acknowledging that we were n't born with ownership of it			0
maybe it 's ok to be gay ? maybe @entity148 is just another way of saying " @entity79 " ? back in 2004 , state sen. @entity2 explained , " i 'm suspicious of too much certainty in the pursuit of understanding just because i think people are limited in their understanding			1
" this take on faith dominates in @entity157 and its @entity91 @entity159 branch			0
personally , i do n't much like it			0
as a @entity162 , i believe that the truth is contained in the @entity164 and is lived through communion in the @entity86 -- and all this talk of humility is navel - gazing in a world crying out for the @entity169 : that @entity64 has died for its sins and offers a shot at heaven for those willing to trust in him			0
i also think that politically empowering this brand of @entity7 has not always been best for the @entity91 , either			0
@entity2 's rejection of @entity91 exceptionalism is reasonable and sometimes has helped avoid reckless intervention			1
but it has also reduced the @entity91 ' self - confidence and weakened the ability of the @entity182 to provide moral leadership			1
the cost is counted in the caliphates that flourish in @entity186 and the @entity187 -- places where an appeal to humility is a nice idea but never going to catch on			0
while the @entity194 is busy being modest , its @entity193 enemies brim with self - assurance			0
but i would n't deny that @entity2 is a @entity3 , belongs to a valid and probably growing strain of @entity7 , and that he is in fact one of the most interesting religious thinkers to inhabit the @entity199 for a very long time			1
the challenge faced by conservatives is surely not to brand him un-american but rather to answer his specific points in a manner that asserts that our brand of @entity7 is just as compassionate and intellectually rigorous			0
among @entity3 , surely , humility is a blessing .			1

@entity209 : @entity2 riled right at prayer breakfast by invoking crusades , @entity31 to show *danger* of violence used to advance faith
@entity209 : it 's wrong to say @entity2 not @entity3 , but the humility of his *approach* weakens the @entity182 's moral leadership
