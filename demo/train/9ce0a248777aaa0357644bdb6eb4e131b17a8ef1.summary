@entity0 , @entity1 -- staking out for news at the site of the mine explosion here , i remembered what i miss most about @entity9 -- the people			1
their stories are what drew me up here in 2006 as a correspondent for the @entity16			1
their hardships , struggles , passions , faith and quirks shaped hard - hitting stories about a region that few give much thought to these days			0
i covered a mine disaster back then , too -- the explosion at @entity27 that killed five coal miners -- and found myself marveling at the strength of the families and the community			1
and , despite their pain , they were hospitable , allowing a green reporter without a signal to use their living room phone , rest on their front steps and ask a few questions about their fears and worries			0
i left after more than two years of sharing their stories , and hoped to return someday to catch up with my mountain neighbors and the families who allowed me to walk into their homes and share their lives with the world			2
instead , i returned for tragedy			0
not much has changed this time around as i help cover the latest disaster for @entity2 -- this time four miners unaccounted for and at least 25 dead			1
i 'm still amazed by the teachers who have allowed us reporters to use their classrooms as impromptu work areas , the nearby residents who insist on making sure we eat during the long days , the miners who bravely re-enter the mines just a day after losing some of their closest friends , and the victims ' families , who remain patient as they wait for news			2
i do n't know how they do it , how they stay so composed , so strong in the face of such a horrific disaster felt miles away			2
and through it all , they accept our presence with a dignified grace			0
i ca n't imagine them handling it any other way .			0
