-- @entity2 secretary of state @entity1 took exception with @entity5 's human rights record saturday , but at the same time he defended that government 's right to defend itself against terror groups disrupting @entity10 's most populous nation			1
in his first visit to @entity10 since taking office earlier this year , @entity1 singled out @entity5 's @entity13 as " a terrorist organization , " though the @entity2 does n't formally list the @entity16 militant group as such			1
" one person 's atrocity does not excuse another 's , " @entity1 said , visiting the region on the day it celebrated the 50th anniversary of the @entity20			1
@entity1 noted that @entity13 has " wantonly upset the normal governance of @entity5 in fundamental ways that are unacceptable			1
" then he endorsed @entity5 's right " to defend itself and to fight back against terrorists			1
" but @entity1 said he has raised " the issue of human rights " with @entity5 's foreign minister			1
" we have talked directly about the imperative of @entity5 troops adhering to the highest standards and not themselves engaging in atrocities or in human rights violations			1
that is critical , " @entity1 said			2

" @entity43 is not the motive			0
it 's ridding yourself of a terrorist organization so that you can establish a standard of law that people can respect			1
and that 's what needs to happen in @entity5			2
" @entity56 reported this month civilian deaths and abuses by @entity5 forces in its campaign against @entity13			1
the conflict between the military and insurgents was evident more than a week ago when special forces targeted @entity13 and other groups , killing 14 suspected terrorists and capturing 20 others			2
however , much of @entity5 violence in recent years has been blamed on @entity13 , which means " @entity70 education is sacrilege			2
" last week , a spokesman for the @entity73 human rights commissioner told reporters that @entity13 could face war crimes charges for alleged ethnic and religious cleansing in @entity5			2
last december and january , the @entity16 group killed 34 people , including 27 @entity80 attending @entity82 services , officials said			0
also , @entity56 said the @entity16 group has killed more than 2,800 people in an escalating campaign to impose strict @entity86 law on largely @entity87 northern @entity5			0
@entity5 , with nearly 175 million people , is considered the political and economic powerhouse of @entity91			0
@entity93 in oil , the country is a key @entity2 partner			0

the @entity20 was formed to rid the continent of colonialism and apartheid and to promote cooperation for development			0
