-- could you catch a wild gorilla ? what about a person dressed as a gorilla ? this week , staff at @entity8 's @entity7 practiced capturing escaped animals by chasing around one of their colleagues wearing a gorilla suit			1
visitors gaped as scores of helmet - wearing keepers surrounded the " gorilla " with cars and nets			1
@entity19 then pretended to tranquilize their coworker , who swooned dramatically and collapsed to the ground			0
the acting ape was immediately wrapped in a large net and hauled away on a truck			0
the escaped animal drill at the @entity8 zoo is conducted every other year , and this time zookeeper @entity28 was chosen to wear the animal costume			1
" in our work there may be times when we need to capture an animal , but we would never be the ones being captured , " @entity30 told reporters			2
" so i tried to feel what an animal might feel and realized when they were on the run they would be scared			1
that 's how i felt			0
" but some onlookers were barely moved			0
one @entity45 user posted on @entity46 , " @entity7 's escape drill was n't tense at all			1
" another wrote , " the gorilla escape drill was so laid back ! made me laugh			2
" the practice is part of the city 's earthquake preparedness drills , where city workers prepare for scenarios that may occur in the event of an earthquake			0
that includes capturing raging beasts			2
in the past , the @entity7 has tried using different animal outfits : in 2004 , two men ran around the zoo while wearing a giant papier - mâché rhinoceros over their heads			1
the technique is n't just @entity45 -- in 2012 , the @entity67 in @entity68 , @entity66 practiced capturing an employee in a giraffe costume			1
the year before that , zookeepers in @entity73 " caught " a man dressed as @entity75 from the " @entity77 " cartoon			0
of course , real animals are more difficult to catch			0
when an actual monkey escaped from the @entity7 in 2010 , it took six hours before officials finally netted it in the basement of a neighboring restaurant .			0
