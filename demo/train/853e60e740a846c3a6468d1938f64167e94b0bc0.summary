-- they live at the end of a runway at one of the nation 's busiest airports , and only now has anyone cared to identify them and even give them a name			2
they are yellow - bellied legless lizards , and their species name is @entity13 , after 98 - year - old herpetologist @entity14			1
their home is in the dunes west of @entity18			1
@entity14 ' namesakes , which look like snakes , were discovered and identified by @entity21 , a herpetologist with the @entity23 at the @entity24 , and @entity25 of @entity26 , @entity26			0
the pair also reported finding three other new species of legless lizards , all from @entity30 , in research published this week in the journal @entity33 from the @entity34 at @entity35			1
giant lizard named for @entity37 tells tale of climate change the other legless lizards were found among oil derricks in the @entity42 , on the edge of the @entity44 and in a vacant lot in downtown @entity46			1
" these are animals that have existed in the @entity42 , separate from any other species , for millions of years , completely unknown , " @entity25 said in a statement from @entity24			2

olinguito the newest rare mammal species discovery the a. stebbinsi were found under leaf litter			2

the specimens were collected over a 14 - year period , the researchers said			0
in fact , the researchers reported that all of the species were actually in collections and stored in alcohol			0
the alcohol , however , removed coloring so scientists had to do genetic testing to confirm that those specimens were part of the previously unidentified species			0
' @entity96 bat , ' other bizarre species found the four new species bring to five the number of known legless lizard species in @entity30			1
the previously identified common legless lizard of @entity30 looks like the @entity104 stebbinsi , and the two can only be distinguished by genetic testing , the researchers said			1

rocket frog takes a flying leap and you must be wondering how to tell a legless lizard from a snake			0
according to the @entity115 of @entity116 , the easiest way to tell the difference is to look them in the eyes			0
