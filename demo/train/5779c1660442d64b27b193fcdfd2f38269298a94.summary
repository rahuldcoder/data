-- april 28 , 2011 download @entity2 maps related to today 's show : @entity4 @entity5 transcript this is a @entity8			1
this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated			2
@entity12 , @entity13 : i 'm @entity15 , and in today 's show , we 're talking about the @entity19 economy , education , defense -- could be a presidential cabinet meeting			1
and we 're gon na be talking about the cabinet , too			2
@entity0 starts right now ! first up : @entity24 @entity25 : first up , violence in @entity4 , where a gunfight broke out at an air force compound in @entity29			1
eight @entity19 service members and an @entity19 contractor were killed in the shooting wednesday			1
@entity34 officials said an @entity4 military pilot started the gunfight			1
the @entity36 said it 's responsible for yesterday 's shooting			1
the @entity36 is the group that the @entity19 - led coalition removed from power when the @entity4 war started in 2001			1
a @entity36 spokesman said the group had worked with the shooter			0
but coalition authorities -- and the shooter 's brother -- denied that			1
the shooting happened at the @entity50			0
officials say it started as an argument between the @entity4 pilot and an international colleague			1
that argument led to the gunfight			1
@entity58 @entity25 : some changes getting ready to happen inside president @entity61 's administration			1
in fact , it 's going to be one of the biggest shifts since @entity61 took office			1
and it starts with this man : defense secretary @entity69			0
secretary @entity69 has been leading the @entity70 since @entity71 was president			0
he stayed on at president @entity61 's request , but he 's planning to retire later this year			1
and this is who president @entity61 wants to replace @entity69 : name is @entity76			0
he 's currently the director of the @entity77			2
he also served as former president @entity79 's chief of staff			2
president @entity61 plans to nominate director @entity76 to be the new defense secretary			0
the @entity81 has to confirm him for that position			0
@entity83 @entity25 : that was n't the only announcement at the @entity86 yesterday			0
president @entity61 publicly showed off his birth certificate , which says that he was born in @entity88 , @entity5			0
why ? well , there are two requirements to be @entity19 president			1
you have to be at least 35 years old , and you have to be a " natural born " citizen			0
some people had doubts that president @entity61 was born in the @entity19 they wanted to see this : his long - form birth certificate			1
because without that proof , their argument was that he might be constitutionally ineligible to be president			0
this issue 's gotten a lot of attention in the media recently			2
the @entity86 released the birth certificate yesterday to try to put an end to the questions			0
@entity108 @entity109 , @entity13 : today 's shoutout goes out to ms. @entity112 's enrichment class at @entity113 in @entity79 , @entity114 ! what is the term for financial aid that companies get from the government ? here we go ! is it : a ) subsidy , b ) commodity , c ) liability or @entity123 ) security			1
you 've got three seconds -- go ! financial aid given out by the government is called a subsidy			0
that 's your answer and that 's your shoutout ! gas prices , oil profits @entity25 : subsidies are usually designed to help companies or industries that produce things for the public			1
for example , farmers might get money from the government to grow crops			0
this next report from @entity145 is about subsidies for the oil industry			1
with gas prices increasing , so are the questions about whether those subsidies should continue			2
( begin video ) @entity152 , @entity153 national correspondent : the oil and gas industry rakes in billions of dollars in profits a year			1
last year , @entity156 made more than $ 30 billion ; @entity157 , $ 19 billion ; @entity158 , more than $ 11 billion ; and @entity159 , $ 20 billion			0
meanwhile , it 's costing consumers a load of money just to fill up their tank			2
@entity165 : there 's no reason for the price to continue to go up , because there 's lots of gas			2
i mean , lots of oil , i hear			2
@entity174 : average price for regular gasoline is $ 3.87 a gallon			0
but in cities like @entity179 , gas at some stations is already at the $ 5 mark or higher			0
those prices are expected to contribute to huge first - quarter profits for oil companies			2
on top of the mega-profits , the oil industry enjoys $ 4 billion in federal tax breaks			1
there 's now a growing chorus to end those subsidies			1
@entity193 , financial analyst , oppenheimer and company : the oil companies do not need subsidies , especially when you have $ 100 oil			1
it 's outrageous for an oil company or oil lobbyist to ask for a subsidy when you have this high level of profitability			1
@entity174 : the @entity206 represents the largest oil companies			2
@entity206 's senior economic adviser , @entity208 , says when profits are up , it 's the shareholders who benefit			2
she says they are , for the most part , regular joes			0
@entity214 , @entity215 , @entity206 : and at the end of the day , the final earnings , the profits to these companies , broadly go to tens of millions of @entity19			1
anybody with a 401 ( k ) , a pension plan , retired firefighters , teachers			0
these are the folks that , at the end of the day , benefit from these earnings			0
about 98.5 percent of the stock of these companies is broadly owned by the @entity19 people			1
@entity174 : the @entity206 says taking away those subsidies would be like a tax on the companies and could cost @entity19 jobs			1
but it is a hard case to make when so many @entity19 out there are getting squeezed at the gas pump , when we are seeing $ 5 a gallon for gasoline , and when the companies are making billions in profits			1
@entity145 , @entity153 , @entity179			1
( @entity239 ) southern storms @entity25 : this next headline is one you 've heard a lot lately , and not one we like reporting : the southern @entity19 recovering from another round of severe weather that plowed through the region yesterday			1
at least 12 deaths were reported			0
hundreds of thousands of people lost power			0
this is what some @entity253 residents woke up to wednesday morning : damaged buildings , downed trees , no power			0
that 's from another storm system that moved through the @entity260 tuesday night			2
and this severe weather may not be over			0
the @entity261 issued tornado watches for parts of the @entity260 yesterday , as the storms worked their way east			0
in fact , there were 25 tornado warnings across parts of @entity270 last night			0
and officials said a tornado hit the city of @entity274			0
these images you 're seeing are some of the damage that was caused			0
show your teacher appreciation @entity25 : we 've been asking you to head to @entity280 and send us your ireports for @entity282			0
keep at it , do n't give up ; teacher @entity282 is next week			0
there 's just something we want you to remember : you need to be at least 13 to send us an @entity288			2
also , you can show your teacher appreciation on our blog ! i just put the post up last night , and you know where to find it : @entity280 ! do n't @entity296 @entity25 : @entity153 's " @entity298 " series explores different aspects of @entity19 society			1
the newest documentary we worked on focuses on something you are all very familiar with : education			1
i had the chance to sit down recently with @entity153 's @entity309			1
she 's the correspondent for the " @entity312 " programs , and we talked about what this new program is all about			2
( begin video ) @entity25 : @entity309 , you 've worked on @entity153 's " in @entity19 " series			1
we 've seen " @entity318 , " " @entity319 in @entity19			1
" your latest report is titled " do n't fail me			0
" what 's the story behind that title ? @entity309 , @entity325 , special correspondent : it really is an " @entity328 " series			2
" @entity332 " is the story of three students who represent different geographical and also socio - economical areas in the @entity19			1
and what we wanted to look at in that particular title was really the position students , @entity19 students , are in today			1
you know , @entity19 students rank 17th and 25 in math and science , respectively , in this country , when you look at all industrialized nations			1
those are terrible , terrible , terrible statistics			0
and so , the question was : how do you change that ? how do you move the @entity19 back up to number one , where we used to be several decades ago ? the question is really these three students , who are great students , ambitious students , motivated students			1
who , their plea is very much " do n't fail me			0
" sometimes teachers fail students , sometimes systems fail students , sometimes students fail themselves ; they 're not ambitious			2
in this particular case , we 're looking at the entire educational system			0
is it failing these young people ? ( @entity239 ) @entity25 : those of you who participated in @entity365 will wan na check this out too ; that 's part of this program			1
you are not going to want to miss it			0
" @entity332 " airs on may 15th -- that 's a sunday night -- at 8 p.m. et on @entity153			1
and if you want to check out my full interview with @entity309 , learn what else she has to say about the upcoming documentary , you can check that out on our home page : @entity280			1
before we go @entity25 : all right , before we go , we 've got time for a speedy lesson			0
@entity165 : take your foot off the brake and we 'll go forward			0
@entity25 : move forward , all right			0
this ai n't driver 's ed. it 's pace car 101			2
@entity386 's been a big @entity387 fan for 50 years			2
and since she 's turning 100 years old today -- happy birthday -- her family got her an amazing gift : the chance to tool around the track in a pace car			1
ms. @entity386 has n't been behind the wheel of any car in about 16 years , but it was smooth sailing as she revved it up to about 50 miles per hour			0
goodbye @entity25 : maybe this 'll be her new motor -- mode or -- method of transportation			0
she probably bragged that she was going more than 50 , but that 's just rev - isionist history			2
especially since the course tracked her speed			0
we were gon na drive through a few more of these puns , but we got ta learn to pace ourselves			2
so we 'll brake for now			0
for @entity0 , i 'm @entity15			0
