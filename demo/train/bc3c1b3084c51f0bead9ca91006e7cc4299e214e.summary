-- it 's one of the fastest growing cities in the world situated in one of the most rapidly developing nations			2
every year , roughly 200,000 newcomers arrive in the @entity8 capital of @entity9			1
some head to the city 's sprawling informal slums while others land in more upmarket residential areas			2
this vast influx of people has contributed to a chaotic urban scene , a burgeoning population of almost 13 million people and a boom at the higher end of the city 's housing market			1
around 50 years ago , residents in neighborhoods like @entity26 in south @entity9 's leafy inner suburbs paid rents of just $ 5 per month			1
today , this same area hosts properties that market for $ 100 million each			1
nearby districts such as @entity33 ( where a two - bedroom house sells for $ 300,000 ) and @entity35 ( where a similar property can go for $ 950,000 ) have witnessed a similar surge in prices			1

some have been forced to make the most of tight locations			0
" we took six to eight months to complete this project , " explained @entity52 , a developer whose family bought a small plot of land and developed a compact yet modern four - story apartment block between two old , crumbling houses			0
" we have partly sold it , " already she proudly adds			0

" because of the drainage it was ( previously ) difficult to stay here because it was smelly , " @entity52 said			0
" but the government has invested a lot into bringing up gardens and covering these drainages , which is why the property prices here have increased now			1
" see also : a new star on the rise in @entity82 's property market and they have increased considerably			2
homes such as @entity52 's sell for roughly $ 4,000 per square meter ( $ 371 per square foot )			1
with a total area of 75 sq m ( 807 sq ft ) this means the asking price for @entity52 's two bedroom house comes in at $ 300,000			0
yet according to local estate agent , @entity93 , these high prices still equates to a smart investment			0
" i do n't see value in terms of size here , " @entity93 said			0
" but why people buy here is they see a potential for appreciation and a stable return because the demand in the city is ever increasing , " he added			0
for the 2.3 million people ( 17 % of the city 's population ) residing in @entity9 's close by slum neighborhoods such ostentatious concerns remains a far cry from reality			1
those with the means , such as @entity93 and @entity52 , however , expect to see more growth in their respective investments as the @entity9 population increases further			1
