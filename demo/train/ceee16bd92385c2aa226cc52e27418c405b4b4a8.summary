-- in february 1990 , the same month that @entity3 , also known as @entity3 , walked free after 27 years behind bars , @entity2 's then - president , @entity1 , issued written instructions to dismantle the nation 's atomic arsenal			1
like @entity3 's achingly long incarceration , the apartheid regime 's development of these most abominable weapons , though never officially acknowledged , had become an intolerable blight on @entity2 's image abroad			1
divesting ourselves of the bomb was -- as @entity1 later remarked -- an essential part of our transition from a pariah state to an accepted member of the family of nations			0
in his time as president , from 1994 to 1999 , @entity3 frequently implored the remaining nuclear powers to follow @entity2 's lead in relinquishing nuclear weapons			1
all of humanity would be better off , he reasoned , if we lived free from the threat of a nuclear conflagration , the effects of which would be catastrophic			0
addressing the @entity32 in 1998 , he said : " we must ask the question , which might sound naive to those who have elaborated sophisticated arguments to justify their refusal to eliminate these terrible and terrifying weapons of mass destruction -- why do they need them anyway ? " despite @entity3 's undisputed moral authority and unmatched powers of persuasion , his @entity44 for disarmament went unheeded in his lifetime			1
@entity2 , to this day , remains the only nation to have built nuclear weapons and then done away with them altogether			1
nine nations still cling firmly to these ghastly instruments of terror , believing , paradoxically , that by threatening to obliterate others they are maintaining the peace			0
quite unaccountably , all are squandering precious resources , human and material , on programs to modernize and upgrade their arsenals -- an egregious theft from the world 's poor			2
@entity3 attributed the lack of progress in achieving total nuclear disarmament to " @entity67 inertia and an attachment to the use of the threat of brute force to assert the primacy of some states over others			1
" to his mind , the struggle against the bomb was intertwined , inextricably , with the struggles to end racism and colonialism			0
he abhorred the double standard , deeply entrenched in today 's international order , whereby certain nations claim a " right " to possess nuclear arms -- in the hundreds , even the thousands -- while simultaneously condemning , and feigning moral outrage towards , those who dare pursue the same			2
we must vociferously challenge the perceived entitlement of a select few nations to possess the bomb			0
as ban ki - moon , the @entity32 @entity92 , put it succinctly in january of last year : " there are no right hands for wrong weapons			0
" but how do we uproot the discriminatory order ? how do we end the minority rule ? in our decades - long fight against apartheid in @entity2 , we depended upon the combination of an irrepressible domestic groundswell of popular opposition to the regime and intense and sustained pressure from the international community			2
the same combination is needed now in the movement to abolish nuclear weapons			1
this week , in the @entity115 state of @entity116 , ministers and diplomats from three - quarters of all nations -- those not coming include the @entity118 members of the @entity119 , the @entity120 , @entity121 , @entity122 , @entity123 and @entity124 -- are gathered to discuss the devastating humanitarian impact of nuclear detonations			2
this will cover the inability of emergency workers to provide relief to the wounded ; the widespread dispersal of radiation ; the lofting of millions of tonnes of soot from firestorms high into the upper troposphere ; the collapse of global agriculture from lack of sunlight and rainfall ; the onset of famine and disease on a scale never before witnessed			0
this conference is not only a much - needed reminder of what nuclear weapons do to humans beings -- something seldom mentioned in arms control discussions -- but also a vital chance for the international community to chart a new course			1
it is high time for the nuclear - free nations of the world , constituting the overwhelming majority , to work together to exert their extraordinary collective influence			0
without delay , they should embark on a process to negotiate a global treaty banning the use , manufacture and possession of nuclear weapons -- whether or not the nuclear - armed nations are prepared to join them			1
why should these weapons , whose effects are the most grievous of all , remain the only weapons of mass destruction not expressly prohibited under international law ? by stigmatizing the bomb -- as well as those who possess it -- we can build tremendous pressure for disarmament			0
as @entity3 understood well , a world freed of nuclear arms will be a freer world for all			2
the views expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity193 .			0

the month @entity3 left prison , @entity2 's president ordered its atomic arsenal dismantled
@entity193 says nuclear weapons -- like apartheid -- were a blight on @entity2 's image
as president , @entity3 implored the remaining nuclear powers to also give up their weapons
@entity193 says nuclear weapons and those who hold them should be stigmatized
