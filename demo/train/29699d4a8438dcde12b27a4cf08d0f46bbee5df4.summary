-- in mid-july this year , a roar echoed around one of the most remote inlets of northern @entity4 -- and an island was born			1
no ordinary island , but a huge chunk of ice , roughly twice the size of @entity10 , that had broken from the @entity12			2
scientists gave it the romantic name of @entity16 and watched it begin to drift slowly into the @entity18 , which separates @entity4 from @entity19			1
then it began to break up , spawning several smaller ice islands			1
the birth of @entity16 - 2012 was no isolated event			0
the @entity12 had lost a much larger chunk in 2010			0
it also broke into fragments , though that may not be the right word			0
one of them alone was estimated to weigh 3.5 billion tonnes , or metric tons ( 3.86 billion short tons ) , according to @entity32 @entity31 , a researcher at @entity33 in @entity19			2
@entity19 's ice shelves are also retreating fast			1
and as the @entity37 warms , both glaciers and ice - shelves are launching floating islands into the sea that may threaten shipping , the fishing industry and off - shore oil and gas platforms			1
the air around northern @entity4 and @entity44 has warmed by about 2.5 degrees @entity45 in the past 25 years			2
ocean temperatures in the @entity37 are also thought to have risen , though there is less data on them			0
@entity31 noted in a paper presented at the @entity51 in @entity52 last week that while " management of a 3.5 billion - tonne ice island away from offshore structures may theoretically be possible , putting it into practice would be logistically very challenging			2
" one option , she said , would be to cover the surface of the ice island with carbon , which would accelerate its melting , but " the challenge then would become dealing with numerous smaller ice fragments as opposed to one large one			2
" and even a small one could be the size of a football stadium			0
scientists are only now beginning to research these ice islands and the rate at which they melt and divide , especially as the @entity37 waters warm and the restraining effect of sea ice disappears			1
they have been using @entity75 -- the undersea equivalent of surveillance drones -- to map the underside of ice islands			1
uncovering the secrets of @entity4 's ice after the 2010 " calving " from the @entity87 , several fragments between them containing billions of tons of ice drifted south along the @entity89 coast , interfering with shipping in the @entity91			1
one traveled 150 miles ( 240 kilometers ) in just one week			0
@entity93 , a researcher at @entity94 in @entity95 , has been following one 12 million - tonne fragment that was one of the progeny of the 2010 calving of @entity12			0
nicknamed @entity101 , it was still wandering around a year later near @entity102 in @entity103 before finally disintegrating in the fall of 2011			0
@entity93 will be presenting his research at the @entity107 conference in @entity108 next week			2
he says that in 2011 alone 3 billion tons of ice broke away from @entity19 's major ice shelves on the northern coast of @entity44			1
@entity93 told @entity0 that that @entity19 's ice shelves have been diminishing for the past century			1
but the rate has accelerated dramatically in recent years , and today they are just half the size they were only seven years ago			2
as a graduate student , @entity93 discovered a major crack in the @entity119 in 2002			0
on a visit six years later he was surprised to see the shelf riven with fissures			0
since then it has largely disintegrated			0
the @entity124 measured some 120 square kilometers ( 46 square miles ) until some 60 % of it broke away in 2008			0
now there 's just 7 square kilometers left			0
" the ice shelves are on their way out , " he told @entity0			1
" in several decades they may be gone altogether			0
" ice islands may pose a greater threat than icebergs because they have a relatively shallow draft , @entity93 says , which is often about 40 meters ( 130 feet )			1
" this poses a significant risk to offshore platforms that are usually protected from massive icebergs by being situated in shallow waters , " he said , especially as exploration for oil grows in areas such as offshore @entity4 , and the @entity138 and @entity139 seas			2
the same warmer temperatures that are encouraging the collapse of ice shelves are melting icebergs and ice islands before they reach the @entity150 , according to the @entity151 , a program led by the @entity153 to protect shipping from the sort of disaster that befell the @entity157			1
in recent years the number of icebergs surviving south of the 48th parallel has declined , according to the @entity151			1
along with the decline in sea ice , the disappearance of ice shelves that are thought to be thousands of years old is rapidly changing the @entity37 landscape			1
ice shelves harbor surprisingly diverse collections of organisms in pools of sediment , organisms that might have value as enzymes capable of functioning in extreme cold and harsh light , @entity93 said			1
they have also acted as a sort of barrier , protecting huge glaciers from exposure to warming waters			0
now that the ice shelves are disintegrating , these glaciers -- which are up to 10 kilometers ( 6 miles ) wide -- are thought to be melting more rapidly , and contributing to rising sea levels			1
warmer temperatures in @entity4 have led to widespread flooding in the southwest of the island as the ice sheet melts at rates unprecedented in the modern era			2
in the @entity193 blog last july , researcher @entity191 wrote : " in the four years our camp has existed on this glacial river , more meltwater is spilling out from beneath @entity198 than we 've ever seen			0
" were that process to continue or accelerate , many scientists say , the anticipated rise in sea levels over the next few decades may have to be revised upwards			0
the @entity205 , in its annual @entity203 , published this week , said dramatic melting of the @entity4 ice sheet had occurred in july , " covering about 97 percent of the ice sheet on a single day			2
" @entity209 , co-author of the report , said on the @entity205 website : " as the sea ice and snow cover retreat , we 're losing bright , highly reflective surfaces , and increasing the area of darker surfaces -- both land and ocean -- exposed to sunlight			0
this increases the capacity to store heat within the @entity37 system , which enables more melting -- a self - reinforcing cycle			0
" all the evidence says that what in effect is the world 's source of air conditioning is getting weaker , with consequences that will be felt far below the 48th parallel .			1

@entity4 's glaciers and @entity19 's ice shelves are diminishing fast , scientists say
giant ice islands are breaking off , sometimes floating into shipping lanes
yet the number of icebergs surviving south of the 48th parallel has declined
scientists are just beginning to research the rate at which ice islands melt and divide
