@entity65 fielded three new signings with both @entity115 striker @entity114 -- signed for Â £ 7.2 million ( $ 11 million ) from @entity116 -- and @entity117 -- who joins from @entity119 -- making bright starts for the club			0
but it was new keeper @entity123 -- signed from @entity124 -- who stole the show saving a penalty from @entity127 at the death to ensure @entity65 's win			2
