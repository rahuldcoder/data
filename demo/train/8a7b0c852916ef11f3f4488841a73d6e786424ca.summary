-- what would you do after @entity3 killed your beloved product ? for @entity6 , the inventor of the @entity8 video camera , the answer was simple : start a venture - backed nationwide chain of grilled cheese sandwich joints			1
that may sound like @entity12 has lost his marbles , but bear with us			2
@entity12 's genius , as shown in the highly popular @entity8 , is creating super-easy , mass - produced technology			1
with his new business , @entity18 , he 's done that twice over			2
buy a grilled cheese on your smartphone , and you get a qr code to swipe in store when you arrive			1
the back - end software ensures that you get a piping hot grilled cheese in your hands within 60 seconds of checking in			1
@entity12 has also invested a lot of effort on making his grilled cheese hardware easy and effective			1
he tapped @entity34 appliance giant @entity33 to create a brand - new grill with a built - in microwave			1
it nukes the cheese for 15 seconds , then toasts the bread for another 30 seconds			0
we can confirm that the resulting sandwiches , doing the rounds here at the @entity44 conference , were uniformly tasty			0
win or lose , you ca n't deny that @entity12 has put a lot of thought into this scheme			2
he found a breadmaker in @entity51 whose bread was kneaded in such a way that it created air bubbles for the cheese to fill			0
he 's pairing different kinds of bread with different kinds of cheese , as well as simple but tasty soups ( the melt 's only other sale item , apart from @entity63 )			0
sandwiches will go for $ 5 apiece , or $ 8 with soup			0
" we 're selling nostalgia and happiness , " @entity12 told @entity0			2
" grilled cheese makes people happy			1
" evidently , his backers at @entity73 agreed			0
@entity12 wo n't say how much funding he received , but he plans to start more than 500 melt locations in the next four years			2
each store will cost between $ 500,000 and $ 1 million			0
you do the math. famed vc @entity80 is sitting on the board , as is @entity84 retail head @entity83 , and the first handful of stores will open in @entity87 in august			0
some will stay open as late as 2 a.m. , a big deal in a town that largely shuts down at 10 p.m. another reason the whole @entity18 concept might work out better than expected ? one word : calories			0
put a grilled cheese sandwich and a cup of soup next to just about any other fast food option , and it 's going to look like a plate of greens			1
@entity100 may be able to offer you online ordering ( and @entity100 , by the way , is a $ 9 billion business ) , but good luck working off the 500 - odd extra calories a burrito is going to give you compared to the @entity18 's offerings			1
are you buying it ? is @entity109 ready for high - tech grilled cheese ? let us know in the comments			1
