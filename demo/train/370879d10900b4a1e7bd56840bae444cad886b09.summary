in an exclusive interview with @entity3 , dr. @entity0 , the director of the @entity1 , reflected on the lowest moments -- and the surprises -- that occurred when @entity7 became the first person to unexpectedly arrive in the @entity9 with @entity10			1
@entity7 has been the only person in the @entity9 to die of the disease , and two nurses who cared for him became infected with the virus			0
the @entity1 was roundly criticized for its handling of the crisis , and some @entity17 lawmakers called for @entity0 's resignation			1
@entity0 's lowest moment : when the first nurse , @entity20 , was diagnosed with @entity10			1
" we learned that the situation was n't going to be as simple or as controlled as we thought it would be , and we immediately intensified our response to address the situation in @entity26 , " he said			1
he said his biggest surprise was the difficulty of @entity7 's care			0
" @entity30 " how the world reacted as @entity10 spread , an interactive time line " i think we did n't recognize how hard it would be to care for someone with @entity10 who was desperately ill in the @entity9 , and how much hands - on nursing care there would be , and we did n't expect two nurses to get infected , " @entity0 said			1
during @entity7 's hospitalization , @entity0 repeatedly said in press conferences that any hospital in the @entity9 should be able to treat @entity10			1
@entity3 asked @entity0 if he regretted those statements , considering that at @entity43 , @entity7 died and two nurses became infected , but the other nine @entity9 @entity10 patients , who were treated at hospitals that were specially designated to treat the disease , all lived			1
in those cases no workers became infected			0
new @entity10 patient coming to the @entity9 " clearly there are things that we wish we 'd done differently , " he said			2
" the bottom line is that @entity10 is hard to treat , and when the first patient ever with @entity10 came to the @entity9 , we thought the guidelines would protect the health care workers			2
when two health care workers became infected , we recognized the guidelines did n't work			0
" he added that one thing his agency would have done differently would have been to tell nurse @entity63 not to board an airplane from @entity65 to @entity26			0
@entity66 had taken care of @entity7 and had reported a temperature of 99.5 degrees , but was told she could fly , because the @entity1 's threshold at that time for @entity10 was 100.4 degrees			1
@entity66 later was diagnosed with @entity10			2
ebola photographer : i broke down that day @entity3 also asked if he considered leaving his post when several @entity17 lawmakers called for his resignation			0
" i 'm really just focused on stopping @entity10			2
i 'm working around the clock to do that , and i will continue to do that , as long as @entity10 is spreading , as long as i have the opportunity to do that , " he said			1
" i wish i had know then what we know now , " he added			0
" but that 's not how the world works			0
we live life forwards and we understand it backwards			0
looking back with 20/20 hindsight , there are always things we would do differently			0
