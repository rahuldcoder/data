@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 is in the midst of a population explosion			2
in 1966 , the country boasted a meager four million citizens			2
today , that number hovers around the 15 million mark and could reach 37 million by 2050			0
that 's a big number for a country half the size of the @entity12 , and could spell trouble for indigenous wildlife			0
" animals know their range			1
they 're used to feeding and drinking ( in certain areas ) , and those features are still there in the mind of an elephant , " explains @entity17 , a manager at @entity18			0
" when an animal goes back to where it used to go , and suddenly there are people , those people feel the animal is doing something wrong , but in essence , it used to be their home			1
" each year , thousands of wild animals fall victim to human encroachment , poaching and the illegal pet trade			1
the @entity39 -- the country 's only accredited wildlife sanctuary -- is hoping to change that			1
they house over 200 animals and host educational tours for school children to get them into conservation early			1
cast of characters every animal as the @entity39 has a story , and often , not a happy one			1
take for instance @entity51 , a one - armed baboon who was found tied to a tree outside a butcher shop			0
because he likely would n't survive back in the wild , the @entity39 will be his home for the remainder of his life			1
then there are the seven owls ( each since named after one of @entity65 's dwarfs ) who a local found on his roof and , fearing they were bad luck , almost killed them before someone convinced him to call them in instead			0
there 's also @entity73 , a vervet monkey who was kept as a pet and tied to a rope on the roof of a barn			0
as a result , she 's never interacted with other monkeys , and has to be trained to coexist with her own kind			0
" this is a good site for animals who are not getting the proper welfare , " says @entity83 , @entity0 's head of animal care			1
do they stay or do they go ? @entity0 is partnered with @entity91 , 111 miles outside of the reserve , to release some animals back into the wild			1
to qualify for release , an animal needs to have spent part of its life in the wild , or be young enough to adapt			1
it also has to be in good health			0
a lot goes into training animals to reintegrate into the world at large			1
for starters , there is a strict no - human contact policy			0
the subjects are also given predator awareness training			0
once reintroduced into the park , some animals are then monitored by release managers to make sure they 're integrating properly			2
conservation for the future to further the cause , @entity0 hosts thousands of school children each year			1
last year alone , they received over 30,000 school groups			2
they teach the children respect for wildlife , and try and drive home the point that some animals -- like primates -- are n't meant to be pets			2
" we 've managed to come up with various modules , from targeting biodiversity , soil management , climate change , and wildlife welfare , " explains @entity128 , @entity0 's education manager			0
" inspiring youth to conserve nature , to look after animals and have respect towards these animals and also to take a leading role in these projects is important			2
it can be useful in helping them to have a sustainable livelihood			0

each year , thousands of wild animals fall victim to poaching
the @entity39 houses over 200 animal victims
the @entity39 helps *rehabilitate* animals back into the wild
