-- even the best - matched couples sometimes find moments when they sense that something 's not quite right — only they ca n't say what			1
here , 16 love - life lurkers to banish forever			1
the unopened curry in the spice rack the toothbrush is obvious — you get it out of there as soon as an ex first becomes an ex. but what about the indestructible spider plant you grew from his clippings , or the packet of curry you bought together for that recipe you never ended up trying ? or that box of ironic - but - not - completely @entity22 ornaments he picked up from the @entity24 that you ca n't quite explain your inability to @entity26 away ? while we all have the right to indulge in moments of wistfulness for the past ( which memory so often sugar - coats ) , just remember , there 's a reason why you two never ended up making that curry			1
the @entity35 - ca n't - believe - he - said - that thing he said so once — once — your spouse said , in a moment of madness , " yes , yes i suppose your butt is , uh , slightly larger than @entity41 's			1
but so what ? i like it			2
" or else he happened to mention , late at night , after being severely overserved : " my friends all wanted me to marry her			2
" you 'd be forgiven for reading into it — well , if he said it once does that mean it 's just been there in his mind waiting to bubble up to the surface ? ! — but if it 's truly only come up once , consider this a moment of demonic possession , the voice not his own — and do n't give it power it does n't really deserve			1
@entity0 : how to grab a second chance at happiness the running toilet of eternal despair every long - term relationship has that mysterious hinge , when the " how could he ever annoy me ? " of new love turns into the " what about him is n't annoying ? " of familiarity			2
so while you may think that some never - done household chore — the loose banister knob that comes off in your hand every time you go upstairs , the forever - running toilet your guests think is a babbling - brook sound machine — is the one thing keeping your household from peaceful equilibrium , consider that it might just be the receptacle of all your life frustrations			1
there 's an easy solution : a handyman			1
if that 's not possible , resolve to treat your partner with the patience and politeness you would a handyman you wanted to keep in your employ			1
ghosts in the @entity99 internet - search histories are the new journals : you do n't look at someone else 's , and if you do ( unless you 've uncovered some illegal nefarious scheme ) , you are not allowed to be upset by what you 've found			1
relevant search terms : none / of / your / beeswax			2
@entity0 : what 's your conflict style ? the holiday spirit that prevents everyone from getting into the holiday spirit the old argument about where you are going to spend the holidays is a sneaky one			1
it appears to be a simple matter of logistics , but in truth , this yearly conversation is , like any talks regarding wedding planning , baby naming or date - night movie selection , secretly symbolic			1
how can he say he wants to skip your family 's traditional @entity129 picnic because it 's inconveniently scheduled on , you know , @entity129 ? ( @entity132 : @entity133 does he hate your mother ? ) or conversely , how could you have suggested that you did n't want to referee his family 's annual political debate over @entity22 ham ? ( @entity132 : why do you hate his mother ? ) do both of yourselves a favor and try to stop obsessing about why he wo n't just be a sport and eat @entity145 's marshmallow - fluff salad			1
his feelings about your extended family are not his feelings for you			0
after all , he has chosen to be with you — not aunt @entity145			0
the talking box in the bedroom if the voice you hear most often in bed is @entity155 's , it 's time to reconsider the placement of your television			1
you do n't need ghosts and static for that particular box to fry a couple			0
the ill - fated " cowgirl surprise " it was a dark and stormy night			0
you shared a bottle of wine and an article suggesting wild - sex advice , which you giggled over ... and then decided to try			1
and [ ominous thunder clap ! ] it did n't work out so well			0
you wisely never tried it again , though you still recoil at the memory			0
but nothing can kill a sex life like lingering embarrassment , especially if it puts a damper on any further adventurousness			1
can you laugh about it ? no ? huh			0
can you remind yourself that you lived through it , you 're still together and that at least it will never be that bad ever again ? for heaven 's sake , try			1
@entity0 : how to raise the men we 'd want to marry your younger - you 's disapproving glare " i 'm never getting married ! " " i 'll never drive a minivan ! " " we 'll always go out every night — and have sex every day ! " — selected from @entity186 we all want to stay true to ourselves			1
but it 's okay if the " yourself " you 're staying true to has changed			1
when you were 20 , you thought you 'd take a bucket - list trip every year and have enlightening conversations about the meaning of life at every dinner ( each one of which would be life - changing - ly delicious and exotic )			1
if the 40 - year - old you is happy , then do n't let 20 - year - old hold you hostage			0
no offense , but 20 - year - old you was so ... 20 years ago			0
departed soles : the shoes you 'll never wear again whether your relationship began in the previous millennium or last week , it 's inevitable : unless you 're vampires ( in which case , you probably have a whole other set of issues ) , you 're both older now			1
things have been lost : your ability to wear sexy - lady stilettos without whining about your bone spurs ; the bid on the exact - right house that would have been the exact - right backdrop for your exact - right family ( not that you 're pregnant yet ) ; the i 'll - live - forever confidence that fueled your carefree bike rides together ( before a car door knocked the wind out of you , as well as your fearlessness )			0
it 's okay to look back with gentle longing			1
but if you 're obsessing over the path not taken , take a moment to ask yourself if this backwards glancing is helpful in any way			0
chances are , it 's not			2
@entity0 : 3 ways to deal with people who drive you nuts the cobwebs in your bank account many of us are haunted by financial secrets			0
whether it 's a savings account that exists only in imagination , a monster credit - card debt looming from the past or even secret money fantasies ( @entity239 , financial security is your main priority , but you have n't worked up the nerve to admit this to your free - spirited aspiring - artist boyfriend ) , this is probably the top conversation you 're not having but need to			1
no one wants to talk about money			0
but not talking about it does n't make it go away			0
the pickle fork of love add this to pickle forks , baby - wipes warmers and upside - down mortgages on the " @entity255 " : the thought that he may want to get back together with his ex. they broke up			0
and now he 's with you			2
the perfect woman we know , we know , you 're almost perfect			0
you can imagine the perfect you			0
she 's a lot like real you , except just a touch perfecter			2
she effortlessly balances her stellar career and social life , puts her partner and family first and every night finds time to make an interesting and healthful dinner , spotlessly clean her home , talk to her mother , knit a baby hat for a friend , run three miles , read a novel and , of course , get enough sleep so that she can be that same stellar self in the morning			2
she would be the perfect partner			0
and so many of us fall into her wily trap , trying to become her and in the process driving ourselves — and everyone else — crazy			0
here 's the thing about perfect woman : she 's boring			2
she makes everyone feel bad for not being as perfect as she is			0
and besides , too much self - sacrifice does n't actually make a woman perfect ; in practice , it makes her frantic			0
does your partner want to spend eternity with a frantic woman ? more importantly , do you ? did n't think so			2
