" @entity5 " was released 40 years ago to great fanfare			1
" this film , when it came out , lived at the very center of popular culture , " film critic and author @entity7 told @entity0			1
" it was the only thing that people talked about			2
the speed of popular culture was n't as fast as it is now			0
even a big hit like ' gravity , ' people are excited for a week , excited for two weeks , and then it fades away until awards season comes around			2
but it was n't like that in 1973			2
this movie , for a year , really inked out all available entertainment space			2
" @entity7 , author of the book " @entity27 , " recalled " stories about people throwing up at screenings			2
someone sued @entity32 because they were so overwhelmed by the movie they passed out , hit their head on the seat in front of them and broke their jaw			2
and @entity32 settled with them			0
someone attacked the screen in @entity43 because they thought there were evil spirits inside the screen			0
those stories played themselves out over months and months and months and turned the movie into something we 're still talking about 40 years later			2
" based on @entity52 's 1971 novel of the same name , " @entity5 " was nominated for 10 @entity54 and won @entity54 for @entity55 and @entity56			1
it remains one of the highest - grossing films of all time , and is also the first horror film to be nominated for @entity62			1
director @entity63 ( nominated for a best director @entity54 ) , however , never approached the project as a horror film			1
he saw " @entity5 " as a story about the mystery of faith			1
set in @entity69 , @entity70 , " @entity5 " tells the story of 12 - year - old @entity72 ( @entity73 , who received a best supporting actress oscar nomination ) , whose disturbing behavior prompts her mother , @entity77 ( @entity78 , nominated for @entity79 ) , to seek an exorcism after medical doctors are unable to help her daughter			1
the story is loosely based on real events			0
the book and the movie open during an archaeological dig in @entity88			2
@entity63 recalled shooting in @entity89			1
" it was very rare to be given permission to film in @entity88 , " said the director , " let along to film on an archaeological dig. @entity88 , at that time , was not run by @entity92 , but it was governed by the @entity96 , which is @entity92 's party			1
they allowed us to come over here and film on the condition that i would use @entity88 people on the crew and train them in film techniques ; and , strangely , that we would show them how to make film blood			1
" the @entity88 sequence introduces the exorcist himself , @entity111 ( @entity112 ) , who is also an archaeologist			0
the @entity115 priest comes to the realization that he will again fight a demon he has battled in the past			0
@entity63 recalled shooting in the northern @entity88 desert			1
" it would often be 130 degrees by 10:30 in the morning , " he said in a commentary on the film 's @entity121 , " and we 'd have to stop shooting and then go into our tents until 7:00 at night when we then had four more hours of daylight in which we could film			1
" @entity77 , a @entity129 actress filming a movie in @entity70 , approaches @entity132 psychiatrist @entity131 ( @entity133 , who received a @entity135 nomination ) , a @entity115 who feels he 's lost his faith			1
he is riddled with guilt over not having been able to better care for his mother who died poor , scared and alone			0
@entity131 , initially skeptical , agrees to conduct the exorcism			0
@entity111 is summoned to help and the two work together to exorcise the demon @entity142 out of @entity72			0
the scenes that made audiences the queasiest did n't involve green vomit			2
people were reportedly sickened during the scenes that involved @entity72 undergoing medical testing in real time			1
that scene was filmed at @entity154 with a real radiologist and his assistant as they went through the step - by - step process of the invasive procedure			0
some people in the audience fainted seeing the needle go in as the dye was injected and blood spurted			2
the now - famous spider - walk scene , in which @entity72 descends the stairs in the @entity69 home , initially could n't be used in the film in 1973 because wires were visible			1
@entity169 was used to add the scene for a 2000 theatrical re-release , which included a few other scenes totaling 12 minutes			2
the film 's other special effects , including the shaking bed and other moving furniture , were rather do - it - yourself			1
for example , @entity72 's bedroom set was refrigerated			2
air conditioners would n't work because they take moisture out , and the point was to visually capture the actors ' breath on film			2
@entity186 was only 44 when he played @entity111 , so makeup artist @entity187 ( who also created @entity189 's look in " @entity190 " ) transformed the actor into the elderly @entity115 who appears onscreen			0
he also did @entity193 's makeup , transforming her from cherubic to demonic			1
during the shocking scene in which @entity72 masturbates with a crucifix , a box containing a sponge with @entity199 syrup and red food coloring was placed between @entity193 's legs			1
the child actress did n't comprehend the meaning of the scene until years later			0
a mechanical dummy was used for the scenes in which the possessed @entity72 spun her head 360 - degrees			0
the fake vomit was actually a mix of pea soup and oatmeal			0
@entity73 wore contact lenses in a variety of colors and sizes during her character 's various stages of possession , including an all - white pair for when her eyes rolled back into her head			1
when the priests chanted that famous line -- " the power of @entity226 compels you ! " -- @entity193 's body had to be lifted mechanically			1
the background was lit with shadows that helped mask the wires , which were painted as a dotted line to break up the color so they blended in			0
armed with a crucifix , holy water , faith ( which was slowly beginning to return to @entity239 ) , and acting in the name of @entity241 , the two priests summon the power of @entity226 to drive out @entity142			0
weakened by guilt and the demon 's hold over his psyche , @entity131 takes a break			0
upon returning to @entity72 's bedroom , he sees that @entity111 has died			0
enraged , he begs the demon to take him instead of the child			0
@entity131 throws himself out of @entity72 's bedroom window , falls down a steep stairway , and is given last rites by @entity254 ( who was played by a real priest , father @entity256 ) , before dying			0
the infamous flight of stairs leading down to @entity259 in @entity69 consists of 97 stone steps			0
during filming , the special - effects team lined each and every step with a half - inch of rubber			0
the stuntman filling in for @entity131 dove down them twice			0
to this day , " @entity5 " resonates with audiences			1
" i think ' @entity5 ' holds up well because it is , first and foremost , a well - crafted film , cannily designed to be upsetting , " @entity269 , a professor of film at @entity271 , told @entity0			1
" but clearly the narrative has a psychological depth and complexity that shakes us up on a number of levels			0
" it 's not just about a demon inhabiting a little girl , but " it 's also about the vulnerability of those around her and how badly they are damaged by their having to deal with the possession , " explained @entity269 , who pointed out that @entity111 best summed up the demon 's modus operandi when the priest stated that " the demon 's target is not the possessed ; it is us ... the observers ... every person in this house			1
" " the story can shake our understanding of the world and ourselves , " @entity269 continued , " and that 's where the film functions on a level beyond mere entertainment			1
" while the film contains unforgettable images and great scares , @entity7 said , " what i think drew people to this movie is it takes you on such a journey where , in the end , good wins out			1
" the takeaway is that good and evil battle one another out , within everyone , every day			0
" everyone who sees ' @entity5 ' takes from it what they bring to it , " said @entity63			1
" if you believe in the mystery of faith , in the power of goodness over evil ; that is what you will take from the film			0

" @entity5 " is about the demonic possession of a girl and the priests who save her
some of the film 's scenes are considered just as shocking today as they were in 1973
many people consider " @entity5 " to be the *scariest* movie of all time
director @entity63 , however , did not treat it as a horror film
