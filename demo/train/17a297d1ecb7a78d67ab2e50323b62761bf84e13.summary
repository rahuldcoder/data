-- @entity2 mayor @entity1 is resigning in the face of a torrent of sexual harassment claims -- though he 's not going out quietly			1
city attorney @entity6 announced around 3:45 p.m. ( 6:45 p.m. et ) that the @entity8 , during a closed - door session , had accepted the terms of an agreement with @entity1 that was reached after three days of mediation talks			1
@entity1 submitted a " signed resignation " that " the city has accepted " in a 7 - 0 vote by council members , @entity6 said			1
that resignation will take effect at 5 p.m. friday , august 30			0
after that vote , @entity1 spoke at the @entity8 meeting -- his first extensive public comments in weeks -- and began by offering a " deep apology ... to all the citizens			1
" " the city should not have been put through this , " the 70 - year - old mayor said			2
" and my own personal failures were responsible			0
" a short time later , though , @entity1 went on the defensive			1
while admitting that his behavior toward women was inappropriate at times , he insisted that he " never sexually harassed anyone			2
" in the process of " trying to establish personal relationships , " the mayor explained , " the combination of awkwardness and hubris , i think , led to behavior that many found offensive			0
" he added , " not one allegation ... has ever been independently verified or proven in court			0
" " but the hysteria that has been created ... is the hysteria of a lynch mob , " @entity1 said , criticizing an environment in which " rumors become allegations , allegations become facts , facts become evidence of sexual harassment which have led to demands for my resignation and recall			1
" blasting politicians and members of the media who " unleashed a monster , " the mayor said , " the hysteria ended up playing into the hands of those who wanted a political coup -- the removal of a democratically elected mayor purely by rumor and innuendo			1
" " they found the weapons they needed in my own failures as a human being , " @entity1 said of " well - organized interests " opposed to him			2
" but they found with those weapons and they used them , in a bloody and vicious way			0
" the outgoing mayor 's remarks -- going from a contrite apology to a withering attack -- left many watching from inside @entity84 stunned , according to a source who was there			1
the comment about his being the victim of a " coup " especially caught people off guard			2
" we are shocked that he would go there , " said the source inside @entity84			1
this defiant stance notwithstanding , it does n't change the fact that @entity1 's term as mayor ends -- according to a deal he agreed to -- next week			1
and when it does , city council president @entity102 will step in on an interim basis			1
@entity105 said friday afternoon , after the council session , that he 'll soon begin work on setting up a special election			2
speaking shortly after @entity1 , @entity105 -- who , along with the other eight council members , had demanded @entity1 's resignation -- said that he believes the " settlement represents an end to our civil nightmare , and it allows our city to begin to heal			1
" " @entity2 is back , " the incoming interim mayor said later			0
" we are @entity119 's greatest city , and we always will be			0
" the agreement signed off on friday does not affect a lawsuit brought against @entity1 by @entity122 , the mayor 's former communications chief , according to @entity6			2
@entity124 left her job when she sued the mayor in july -- saying he had subjected women to " crude and disgusting " comments and inappropriate touching -- but remains a municipal employee , @entity6 noted			1
he said friday that the city will continue to engage in mediation talks with @entity124 and her lawyer , @entity133			0
under the mediation agreement , @entity2 will dismiss its cross-complaint against @entity1 in relation to that lawsuit , the city attorney said			1
@entity141 's accusers @entity6 also said that , for any claims brought against @entity2 and @entity1 for his alleged conduct while mayor , " the city will provide a joint legal defense through the city attorney 's office for the city and mr. @entity1			1
" friday 's announcement marks the latest milestone in a saga that has gripped @entity2 for seven weeks , when the first in what would be 18 women came forward publicly to accuse @entity1 -- during his time as congressman and , since 2012 , as mayor -- of inappropriate behavior			1
numerous public officials , including all nine city council members and the state 's two @entity163 , urged @entity1 to step down			1
so , too , did a majority of locals , according to polls			0
some of them voiced that view to city council members friday , before they convened in private session to make their decision on the agreement			2
other speakers also rose to support @entity1			2
@entity175 claimed " everything but due process has occurred , " while one woman called what 's happening " a circus to get a good man out of office			0
" a few offered sympathy for the council members , given what they and other municipal leaders have dealt with in recent weeks and the decision that lay ahead			0
" it is really about the city that we all love , " said @entity188 , a longtime civic leader			0
" and make your decision with the intentions of loving your city			0
" even once @entity1 leaves office , the city could bear the repercussions of his alleged behavior			1
as @entity6 noted , the city can be held liable for the actions of its employees -- including its past and present mayor			0
@entity1 , himself , is hardly out of the woods			2
while he now only faces one lawsuit , others could follow			0
plus , there 's the chance that the congressman - turned - mayor could be prosecuted by local , state or federal authorities			0
speaking to that point after news of the resignation became official , @entity221 attorney general 's office spokesman @entity219 said , " we can confirm a criminal investigation is underway			0
" did mayor target victims of military sexual assault ? opinion : will ' mayor naughty ' please step down ? @entity0 's @entity229 , @entity230 , @entity231 and @entity232 contributed to this report .			0
