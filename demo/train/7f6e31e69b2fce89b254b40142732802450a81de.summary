-- next monday , @entity1 is officially shutting down its popular rss feed reader , @entity2			1
the service 's demise after nearly eight years has come as a shock to many who depend on it to collect news into one place from all the websites they love			1
its end has created something of a gold rush among startups and other tech companies vying to take the tool 's place			1
instead of just finding the closest thing to @entity2 , maybe it 's time to change how you consume all that news			1
looking at every single article for a source can be time - consuming , especially if you follow a huge number of sites , and a lot has changed since 2005			1
but before trying anything , take a minute to download all your information from @entity2 now			1
@entity31 bundles up your feeds , folders , followers and other data into a zip file that you can use later with other services			0
( many of the tools we mention will import data automatically from @entity1 if you sign up before @entity2 closes			1
) @entity43 adds web version in new bid for @entity2 users the replacements @entity48 is n't for everyone , and for people who rely on a comprehensive approach to seeing the day 's news , finding the next best reader imitator might be the best interim approach			1
there is already an overwhelming number of replacements that deliver straight rss feeds			0
the best bets are @entity43 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 and @entity63			0
some new tools were rushed on to beat the july 1 demise of @entity2 and are bound to undergo more changes and improvements -- some are still being created such as @entity70 ' @entity69			1
however , the weak links could also end up abandoned in time , and you 'll have to search for a home for your carefully organized rss feeds again			2
think about what 's most important to you			2
are you primarily checking from a mobile device or from a regular web browser , and do you need something that will sync across devices ( some are only available as apps , others in browsers ) ? is sharing stories important , or is reading the news a solitary activity ? how important are images , cost , search features or the absence of ads ? @entity95 suggestions @entity96 is a killer news source			1
major news surfaces naturally on the social network ; a chorus of links or commentary about important stories will likely make its way into anyone 's feed , whether they 're following news junkies or just friends			1
the @entity111 tab shows popular links from your feed as well , but it 's more effective to edit down whom you follow carefully or create custom lists for your various interests			2
you can follow your favorite news organizations or drill down by finding their @entity96 accounts for specific sections or topics			1
if you like specific writers , follow them for their work as well as context on regular news or links to other writers they enjoy			2
hashtags can be great for following news about a specific event or topic			2
@entity134 is a different creature when it comes to news			2
it is decent for finding recommended links , but the posts and banter are more personal , happy and less about the outside world			0
people sometimes avoid posting links or talking about major news stories that might lead to uncomfortable clashes with friends and family			2
( clashes and the resulting conversations are among the best parts of @entity96 and flesh out the big news stories			1
) fight of the aggregator the @entity74 fire hose of news can be overwhelming for many people			1
a handful of clever tools do more than just show you feeds			0
they use your interests and some algorithms to figure out what types of articles and topics you will be most interested in and then serve up content that fits with your patterns			0
articles are typically grouped by sections , such as sports or the stock market			0
the tools are big on sharing and use images heavily for a more magazine - like reading experience			2
@entity177 , @entity178 , @entity179 and @entity180 ( which is owned by @entity0 ) are all popular options			0
come back for the longer reads rss readers are great because you can scan headlines and the first few sentences of articles and get the gist without having to read them , only going further if it 's a topic about which you want to know more			1
the meatier content ( feature stories , long and winding narratives , the @entity193 ) deserves more than a glance , but deep reads are different from the quick scan			0
save the things you want to dig into later , even offline , with tools such as @entity198 , @entity199 or @entity200			0
@entity202 's safari browser also offers a @entity204 button			2
the direct route typing a news site 's url directly into a browser seems so @entity209 ©			1
but when you just need a quick hit , going straight to a trusted local , national or international news organization might satisfy			0
many organizations have their own stand - alone mobile apps on @entity215 , @entity216 and @entity218 devices			0
one advantage of these apps is that you can set up push notifications so you know as soon as something important happens			0
there is also @entity225 , which looks at all the news sources and arranges the breaking stories by popularity , highlighting the in - depth , opinion and featured stories on the topic			0
a neat visual take on @entity225 is @entity234 , which @entity235 created before moving to @entity177 to work as a designer			0
no news is good news the true minimalists can avoid the noise by checking one or two outlets once a day , trusting that the major stories will be featured prominently			0
@entity243 sucks in your @entity96 and @entity134 feeds and turns them into digestible daily e-mails that summarize the most talked about stories of the day			1
if you really want to check out , read the @entity248 post , which is also available as a newsletter			0
every tuesday , it quickly and amusingly runs down the major stories that happened in the past seven days , with links in case you are intrigued and want to find out more			0
mix and match there is no one - fits - all solution for how to consume news , and many people hack together their own custom systems from various sources			0
for example , some go directly to their bookmarked must - read sites in the morning , keep up on current news with @entity96 during the day and soak in longer articles on commutes with tools such as @entity198			1
some multitaskers keep tv or radio news humming in the background while they go about their daily activities			0
@entity2 was a great tool that will be missed , but its death is an opportunity to try new things and play with different apps , sites and tools for reading news online			1
share your news - reading habits and suggestions in the comments .			2

the @entity2 is closing next week , and it 's time to find a replacement @entity74 tool
there are imitation readers , *shortcuts* for later reading and *smart* aggregation apps
with some curating , @entity96 can be a *powerful* news source
