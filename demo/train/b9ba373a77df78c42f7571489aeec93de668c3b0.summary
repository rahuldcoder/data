-- @entity2 's late header sealed a deserved win for @entity4 in the @entity6 quarterfinal clash against @entity7			1
the @entity8 forward , who found form so emphatically with two goals in the previous match against @entity13 , proved the difference once again as he powered home a @entity17 cross with 11 minutes remaining			0
it was no less than @entity4 's display merited after they dominated the second half against an unfancied @entity7 side that started the match brightly but faded drastically			1
@entity4 's win set up a semifinal meeting next wednesday against either @entity24 or @entity25			1

" this match was a repeat of the @entity42 quarterfinal in @entity43 , where @entity44 scored a famous scooped lob to give the @entity7 underdogs a 1 - 0 win			1
it was that losing @entity4 side , elegantly marshaled by the likes of @entity50 and @entity51 , which prompted @entity53 to coin the phrase " sexy football			2
" and there was plenty to seduce viewers in @entity4 's second - half display in @entity59 , as the @entity60 were blown away by their opponents ' pace and guile going forward			1
not that @entity66 side 's superiority was evident in a cagey first half where the @entity68 were labored and sloppy , in contrast to the lively , well - drilled @entity60			1
still , it was @entity2 who almost broke the deadlock with a moment of brilliance seconds before halftime			0
the winger deftly chested down a @entity76 pass inside the @entity7 box , spun cleverly away from @entity78 and unleashed a low shot that bounced back off the post			0
the @entity4 captain looked to the heavens in exasperation , but it was a warning sign the @entity60 would have heeded			0
yet @entity86 's side were powerless to stem the tide of @entity68 attacks that followed after the break			1
minutes after the restart , @entity2 hit the post again -- this time with a fearsome 35 - yard free - kick			2
it set the tone for the remainder of the game as @entity4 relentlessly pinned the @entity60 back , with chances coming thick and fast			2
@entity99 sent a free header tamely over the bar , before @entity102 parried @entity104 's venomous hit and tipped over a fizzing effort from @entity17			0
@entity76 and @entity104 then fired chances over the bar with the goal begging			0
@entity2 , inevitably , had a few attempts of his own too			0
he fired a shot over and had several efforts blocked , the spasms of anguish that greeted each miss becoming increasingly animated			0
but that frustration was released with the clock ticking towards extra time , as @entity2 's aerial prowess came to the fore			2
@entity17 delivered a right - wing cross and @entity2 hurled himself at the ball to send a powerful header into the ground and bouncing over the outstretched fingers of @entity102 to spark wild @entity68 celebrations			0
@entity4 are unlikely to be the favorites in the semifinals , whichever team they face , but with @entity130 's best player looking at the peak of his powers , who would bet against them ?			1
