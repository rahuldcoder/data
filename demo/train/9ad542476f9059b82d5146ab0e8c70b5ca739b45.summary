-- @entity2 - @entity3 ties may be at their frostiest since the height of the @entity5 , but at least there 's some warmth to the relationship between @entity2 secretary of state @entity9 and @entity3 foreign minister @entity10			1
as @entity14 and @entity15 struggle to maintain even a modicum of cordiality , sparring over everything from @entity19 and @entity20 to fugitive @entity22 leaker @entity21 , their top diplomats have developed a rapport that observers say could be key to resolving an array of differences on some of the world 's biggest geopolitical crises			1
at first glance , the two men would seem to have very little in common			0
@entity9 , 70 , is a career politician who served nearly three decades in the @entity31 and is known for his sense of humor and propensity for going off - script during talks			1
@entity10 , 64 , is a career diplomat who has spent more than 40 years as a @entity3 envoy in posts around the world , and has been nicknamed " minister no " for his tough , by - the - book approach to negotiations			1
but both men are from the same generation , and observers say they have developed a mutual respect for one another over a series of face - to - face meetings since @entity9 took the job in february last year			1
" it seems both @entity9 and @entity10 prefer the old school , they do it with grace , " says one @entity52 - based analyst who declined to be named in this report			1
" it looks like they 've developed a pretty good rapport , and this is a stark difference from when @entity10 's partners were @entity63 and @entity64			1
" @entity10 and @entity65 , who was appointed secretary of state by @entity67 , locked horns numerous times during her tenure			0
one @entity73 reporter said @entity10 was known for pushing @entity65 's buttons , writing that the @entity3 had " perfected the art of irritating @entity65 " in meetings			1
@entity77 and @entity10 were all smiles when the former first lady famously handed him a plastic red " reset " button in 2009			0
but the reset did n't last			0
after @entity77 branded @entity3 's decision in 2012 to block a @entity84 resolution on @entity20 a " travesty , " @entity10 said @entity87 criticism of his @entity3 's approach was " on the verge of hysteria			1
" @entity10 and @entity9 have managed to conjure up a @entity91 of sorts over the past year			2
@entity10 's @entity93 is excellent , and both men speak @entity95			0
@entity10 often joins @entity9 to talk policy on his frequent garden strolls during face - to - face meetings , and last month the pair were photographed kicking a soccer ball around the grounds of the @entity2 ambassador 's house in @entity104			1
both are reportedly avid sports fans -- @entity9 played varsity soccer at @entity107 , while @entity10 is a die - hard fan of @entity52 club @entity108			1
and in january , @entity9 surprised @entity10 with a gift of two giant @entity111 potatoes during a meeting in @entity113			2
@entity9 said that his friend had mentioned the spuds during a conversation over @entity117			0
not to be outdone , the @entity3 gave @entity119 spokeswoman @entity118 a pink " ushanka " hat to help her keep " warm and fancy " during the winter storms in the @entity2 but it is their professionalism , not personal interests , that really makes the relationship work , according to @entity129 , director of the @entity130			2
" presidents @entity14 and @entity15 do not get along very well , " @entity129 says			0
" there 's always a personal element about all those relationships , and normally it helps			0
[ @entity9 and @entity10 ] may share an interest in some outside issues , but what really makes that relationship work is that the two men are really good professionals			2
" they 've also showed a willingness to keep picking up the phone , and managed to strike a deal on eliminating @entity20 's chemical weapons stockpile last september			0
and the pair shared a lighter moment at the end of their joint press conference , when @entity9 was unable to hear the end of @entity10 's translated remarks			2
" it was okay @entity9 , do n't worry , " @entity10 assured him , to laughs from reporters			2
a smiling @entity9 replied , " you want me to take your word for it ? it 's a little early for that			0
" @entity19 is arguably an even tougher diplomatic challenge , pitching the @entity2 and @entity3 against each other first in @entity162 , then @entity163 and now in the country 's restive east , where pro-russian protesters have seized government buildings in several cities in the past several weeks			1
@entity9 has accused @entity3 of fomenting unrest to destabilize @entity19 's new , @entity171 - leaning government			1
in return , @entity10 has accused the @entity171 of meddling in @entity19 affairs			2
while @entity9 sometimes appears to go beyond the @entity175 's script during crisis talks , @entity10 consistently offers a faithful translation of @entity14 's foreign policy , according to observers -- one that the @entity171 can sometimes find difficult to interpret			1
" ' the president mainly speaks to the @entity3 people			0
his audience , his constituency is mainly the audience of the @entity3 federation			0
the foreign minister talks to his colleagues in other governments [ and ] couches his phrases in diplomatic speak , " says @entity130 's @entity129			0
" i see no significant daylight between what @entity14 has said and what @entity10 says			0
" @entity3 says it wants @entity19 to set up a federal system in which regions with ethnic @entity3 majorities would have more autonomy			2
the @entity2 says it fears that unrest in the country 's east could be used by @entity3 as a pretext for military intervention			2
as the @entity2 and @entity3 join the @entity205 and @entity19 for four - way talks aimed at defusing the @entity19 crisis , experts hope @entity9 and @entity10 's close working relationship will enable them to take the edge off what are expected to be contentious proceedings			1
" the situation now is very , very tense and very dangerous , " says the @entity52 - based analyst who declined to be named in this report			0
" but the fact that @entity10 and @entity9 talk so often is a very positive sign			0
they can agree and disagree on certain issues , but this personal relationship helps a little bit			0
