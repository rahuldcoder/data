@entity1 , @entity0 -- @entity4 filmmaker @entity3 knows how to get people talking			1
@entity3 's movie " @entity7 " examines police violence and corruption in @entity4			1
the director of " @entity7 " stirred controversy when his action thriller premiered at the @entity13 earlier this year			1
the movie tells the story of an elite police squad that employs a no - holds - barred approach when it comes to battling the drug gangs who control @entity22 's slums , known as favelas			1
told from the perspective of a member of @entity22 's @entity27 , or @entity28 , @entity3 's film has elicited criticism for its extreme violence and what some say is a glorification of ruthless police tactics			1
@entity3 , who co-wrote " @entity7 " with " @entity35 " screenwriter @entity36 and @entity37 , a former @entity28 captain , says he wanted the film to explore the roots of police violence and corruption in @entity4			1
the movie , which casts light on the vicious cycle of violence in @entity4 , " is basically about how the police institution turns individuals into corrupted cops or violent cops , " @entity3 told @entity2			1
" @entity7 , " or " @entity7 " in @entity53 , " is one of the harshest @entity4 slice - of - life movies since @entity52 's @entity51			1
" the violent tone of @entity3 's film contrasts sharply with other recent movies chronicling favela life			1
@entity57 offers a somber look at @entity60 's underclass in " @entity61 , " which was released earlier this year			0
the film from the director of " @entity64 " and " @entity65 " depicts the lives of four brothers and their mother as they struggle to overcome their circumstances			0
meanwhile , @entity79 's " @entity77 , @entity78 " ( 2007 ) , or " @entity77 , our @entity80 , " sets the tale of @entity71 in a @entity22 slum and tells the story of gang warfare through music and dance			2
@entity3 started out making " @entity7 " as a documentary			1
but the members of the police who he interviewed for research did n't want to appear on screen so he decided to turn it into a fictional movie instead			0
the movie was filmed in the favelas , and people on the street offered input as the scenes were shot , @entity3 said			2
shooting in the slums added to the grim realism of the movie , but the undertaking was n't without its own perils			0
at one point during the shoot , a car containing fake guns and five crew members was hijacked by armed drug dealers			0
( the crew members were eventually released and a police raid ensued			0
) @entity22 's slums are , for the most part , populated by honest people striving to survive by honest means , @entity3 told @entity2			2
" but unfortunately , favelas have small groups of heavily armed drug dealers that control the life of everyone there			0
they are the rulers , they are the judges and they can kill you and that 's it			0
" " @entity7 " became the focus of heated debate when it was released in @entity4 last october , prompting discussions about acceptable thresholds of police violence			1
( the police in @entity4 even went as far as trying to get a court order to ban the film			2
) those efforts failed , and the film went on to achieve commercial and critical success			0
it became the most popular film in @entity4 last year and took home the @entity135 , the top prize at the @entity138 festival , in february			1
the drama , which raises challenging questions about the problems confronting @entity4 society , is not the first time @entity3 has tackled tough issues on film			2
he earned acclaim for his 2002 documentary " @entity151 " about the true - story hijacking of a @entity22 bus by a former street child			0
" in that documentary i told how or why the street kid became so violent and i said basically that it is the way the state restricts small time criminals -- by torturing , by killing , by putting them in crowded jails , " @entity3 said			2
" @entity7 " follows a similar vein			0
it takes the same idea but applies it to the police			0
" the bottom line is we are trying to say that the whole violence that goes on in @entity22 is mainly caused by ourselves and we can possibly undo that , " he said .			0
