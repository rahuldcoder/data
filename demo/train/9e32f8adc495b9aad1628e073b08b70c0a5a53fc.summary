-- since the moment @entity3 took office , he has made a concerted effort to speak directly to the @entity7 world			1
election posters hang on the exterior of many buildings in @entity11 , @entity12 , last week			0
even his inauguration address sent a new and different message from the @entity15 : " to the @entity7 world , we seek a new way forward , based on mutual interest and mutual respect , " he said on january 20 , standing in front of a changed nation			1
" to those leaders around the globe who seek to sow conflict or blame their society 's ills on the @entity28 , know that your people will judge you on what you can build , not what you destroy			0
" next month , @entity3 will deliver a long - awaited speech to the @entity7 world from @entity34 , @entity35			1
he will speak at a critical time for @entity12 , days before an election that could bring powerful @entity39 militia group @entity38 to power			1
this possibility could shake the foundation of @entity3 's attempts to bring stability and peace to the @entity46			1
with one of the most powerful armies in the @entity46 , @entity38 is poised to lead @entity12 's government with the help of @entity12 @entity52 opposition leader , gen. @entity51			1
@entity51 signed a memo of understanding with @entity38 in february 2006 and joined the march 8 bloc , led by @entity38			0
that could give the bloc the numbers it needs to control parliament after the june 7 elections			1
there have been sporadic incidents of violence ahead of the vote : billboards have been defaced and just last week , a @entity38 - aligned political office was burned to the ground			0
while these acts of violence are small by @entity12 standards , a friend who lives near the burned office told me it was a " terrifying reminder of last may			0
" that is when @entity38 militants , in a blatant show of force , seized control of the streets of @entity80 , marking the worst violence to hit @entity12 since the end of its civil war in 1991			1
many saw it as an embarrassment to @entity89 's ruling march 14 bloc , which had to grant major political concessions to @entity38 to restore order to @entity80			1
@entity38 's leader has painted may 7 , 2008 , as a " glorious day that prevented civil war , " but journalists like myself remember the day slightly differently : pinned down behind a building by raging gunfire			2
at the time , i could not believe that @entity38 gunmen were about to occupy half of the @entity12 capital			2
they did so until the government gave in ; then they withdrew back to @entity80 's southern suburbs , allowing the city 's wealthy neighborhoods to return to normal for the summer			0
regardless , it was a show of force that people in @entity12 have not forgotten			0
the lead - up to next month 's vote has seen the same , typical -- and at times stereotypical -- @entity80 antics			0
@entity38 has accused @entity89 's political bloc of bringing @entity12 expatriates into the country in droves to try to swing the vote in its favor			1
anyone who drives out to @entity80 's airport can see these expats arriving from countries like @entity122 , @entity123 and the @entity15			0
@entity89 swept to power in the wake of the 2005 assassination of his father , former @entity12 prime minister @entity127			2
many @entity12 blamed @entity128 , which had dominated @entity12 politically and militarily since the civil war , for the killing			0
the assassination sparked widespread protests that led to the election of the younger @entity89 's @entity135 bloc in parliament and the withdrawal of @entity128 troops from @entity12			2
@entity139 has denied any role in @entity89 's killing , but a @entity143 investigation has found indications of @entity128 involvement			0
now , it appears the tide is turning once again in @entity12 , this time in @entity38 's favor			1
three years ago , @entity38 -- which is supported by both @entity128 and @entity149 -- fought a war against the @entity152 military , which failed to weaken the militia			0
since that perceived victory over @entity152 , @entity38 has been considered by its supporters to be the " defender of @entity12			2
" so what happens on june 8 when the world wakes up to a @entity12 that sees @entity38 aligned with @entity51 as the majority and @entity89 's march 14 bloc as the opposition party ? when @entity164 won the elections in @entity166 in january 2006 , former @entity15 president @entity163 called the elections " free and fair			1
" but that made no difference as @entity152 tightened its grip , and the two rival @entity172 factions , @entity164 and @entity173 , killed each other in the streets of @entity166			0
is the situation any different now for @entity12 , or is it perhaps even worse ? @entity12 's political landscape is shifting months after a similar shift in @entity152			2
voters in the jewish state overwhelmingly supported conservative parties over more moderate groups , bringing into power prime minister @entity184 earlier this year			0
@entity184 is viewed in the @entity187 world as more hawkish than his predecessor , @entity188 , who ordered the war against @entity38 in 2006			2
with an estimated 30,000 rockets pointed at @entity152 from southern @entity12 -- all under the control of @entity38 -- how can @entity184 sell the idea to the people of northern @entity152 that they are safe from a country ruled by @entity38 - aligned politicians ? the situation means that the @entity187 world will be listening even more closely to @entity3 's june 4 address in @entity34 to hear whether the @entity15 president will champion democracy -- even if it means an inevitable standoff between @entity152 , a historically staunch ally , and @entity12 , as it struggles to find an identity both within itself and in the outside world .			1

@entity12 elections on june 7 could bring @entity38 to power , says @entity0 's @entity207
that would shake president @entity3 's efforts toward @entity46 peace , @entity207 says
@entity3 plans to give major speech to @entity7 world on june 4 in @entity35
will @entity3 champion democracy , given the situation in @entity12 , @entity207 asks
