@entity0 , @entity1 -- talk about burying the hatchet			1
when former president @entity5 turned out to rally for @entity1 @entity7 gubernatorial nominee @entity6 on friday night , the former rivals hugged and made up			1
the two have a bitter political history dating to 1992 , when they ran against each other in the @entity7 presidential primary			1
back then , @entity6 earned @entity5 's animus by refusing to drop out until well after it was clear @entity5 had locked up the nomination			1
speaking before a crowd on the campus of the @entity18 , @entity0 , @entity6 heaped praise on the former president			1
" let me tell you about president @entity5			0
i do n't need to say much			0
not only was he great in office , but he has been great after he left office , " @entity6 said			1
" he did n't retire to @entity25 to play golf , he 's out there doing stuff			0
he 's helping people in @entity30			0
" he cheered the former president for " motivating ... the highest angles of our spirit			0
" @entity5 returned the favor , telling the crowd of screaming students , " i 've known @entity6 for almost 35 years			1
when we were governors together , we strongly supported to push for green energy ... he knew it was good economics when most people thought it was a fools errand			0
" reviewing @entity6 's history as a two - term @entity1 governor , then mayor of @entity55 and now attorney general , he enthused , " i watched him consistently choose the future over the present , but not take a meat axe to the present " insisting " that 's what you need now			1
" @entity6 is in a tight race with former @entity59 ceo @entity58 , who has funded her campaign with more than $ 119 million of her own money			1
it was @entity58 who first brought @entity5 into this race -- when she ran an ad featuring old footage of then - gov. @entity5 ripping into @entity6 during the 1992 campaign			1
a clearly irked @entity6 responded by making a snarky remark about @entity5 's honesty and tossing in a reference to the affair with @entity70			1
@entity6 later said he called @entity5 's office to apologize and the former president announced plans to endorse his old rival			2
there were times during @entity5 's speech that @entity6 seemed to lose patience , staring at the ground or stonily straight ahead			2
but there were no openly tense moments			0
for most of his remarks , the former president talked about the economy , accusing republicans of digging @entity86 into a fiscal ditch and insisting " the last thing you want to do is put the shovel brigade back in the hole			0
" he made a special appeal to the crowd of mostly college students , imploring them " if young people vote as the same percentage of the electorate they did two years ago , then the good guys win			0
" he also gave praise to the other candidate on the stage , lieutenant governor hopeful @entity103 , who is a @entity5 friend and a supporter of @entity106 's candidacy during the last election			0
but @entity5 offered a special compliment for @entity6			2
" he 's the only politician in @entity86 i 've heard say this except me " and went on to insist that " as horrible " as the recession has been " when we come out of it , if we learn right lessons from it , we will be stronger for it			0
" he criticized @entity58 's policy positions and closed with a @entity6 endorsement saying , " the candidates have radically different ideas : one will lead us to a brighter future and the other will lead us to a movie we 've seen before			2
" when they left the stage , the former adversaries went their separate ways			0
@entity6 walked off while @entity5 worked the ropeline , crossing through the barricade and into the crowd to shake hands with just about every waiting visitor .			2
