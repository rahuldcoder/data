-- it 's another one of those " you ca n't make this kind of stuff up " stories			2
a @entity8 high school senior sued her parents , accusing them of tossing her out of the family home when she turned 18 and refusing to pay for her private high school and college education			1
in a lawsuit , @entity13 of @entity14 , @entity8 , asked a court to have her parents pay the outstanding tuition for her private high school , pay her living and transportation expenses for the foreseeable future , use money from an existing college fund to pay for at least some of her college education , and pay her legal bills			1
at a hearing tuesday in @entity28 , a judge denied the request for high school tuition and current living expenses			2
another hearing will be held in april to deal with the other issues in the suit , including college costs			1
watch : @entity37 's harsh words for suing teen it 's a case of she said versus they said			1
@entity13 says she is an honors student and cheerleader , who was cut off from her family and could lose the opportunity to attend college , where she hopes to major in biomedical engineering			1
@entity48 's parents , @entity49 and @entity50 , argue that she was not kicked out of the house			1
instead , they say she left on her own back in october because she did n't want to abide by their rules			1
mixed into this seemingly dysfunctional family brew are a number of other allegations against each side : that the @entity59 did n't like @entity13 's boyfriend and that they were abusive to her , and that @entity13 missed curfews and was suspended from school			2
no surprise that reaction in social media was swift and significantly tilted in one direction			1
" she is an entitled spoiled brat and will regret this later in life , " wrote @entity67 , ceo and founder of a public relations firm , on my @entity71 page			2
@entity76 , a former elementary school principal and ceo of an educational consulting firm , agreed			0

@entity87 , a @entity89 - based television producer , said , " @entity91 kids have always been there			0
" but there was a little bit of blame for the parents too			1
" her parents have clearly contributed to the development of her character and work ethic ( or lack thereof ) , " wrote @entity99 , a freelance producer and writer and mom of two girls in @entity103			1
" they should settle this by ensuring that she complete her high school degree			0
as for college : until she learns to appreciate what she 's had , she will never be respectful			1
they should cut her off completely			0
her learning to make it on her own will be the best thing in the end			0
" @entity82 , the former school principal , said she feels " deep compassion " for the parents			1

" " as parents , most of us try to do the best we can and hope we can instill enough good common sense and humility in our kids so they may make good decisions , " said @entity137 , who has a 10 - year - old daughter			1
" it saddens me to see the level of entitlement in this generation , but it 's more evidence that by giving our kids every opportunity to realize their potential , we 're also giving them the power to see it as their due rather than the gift and privilege it is			1
" on the other side are people like @entity170 of @entity171 , @entity172 , who believes the appropriateness of suing parents really depends on the individual child 's circumstances " i know of a situation where a 12 - year - old was taken out of private school and had to go to public school in a different city , " said @entity170 , also on @entity71			2
" his parents drank up his school money			2
but in those days a kid did n't sue his parents			2
but it did irrevocably change his life			0
" perhaps the view that sums up this entire case was a tweet with the hashtag # @entity191 by a father of two boys			1
he called it a " terrible situation			0
" indeed it is , because whatever happens , you have a relationship between a child and her parents that is anything but healthy at the moment			2
raising a teenager is n't easy			0
at the same time , being a teenager is no walk in the park either			0
if only both sides could find a way to meet in the therapist 's office -- together -- that would be a step in the right direction , said @entity216 , a @entity89 - based child , adolescent and family psychologist			0
" clearly , there is a breakdown in communication in this family , bordering on limited communication , " said @entity216			0
