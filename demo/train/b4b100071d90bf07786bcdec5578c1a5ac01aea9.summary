-- what happens when a @entity3 architect is given free rein to design what he or she likes ? over the course of the last four years , one @entity8 based tour company has sought to answer that question by asking a practicing architect from @entity3 to create futuristic designs for sustainable tourism developments in the country			1
@entity15 -- which offers organized trips around @entity3 -- provided the anonymous participant who works at the @entity19 in @entity20 with an open brief and no limits on costs , scale or physical possibilities			1
the fascinating results depict something akin to @entity29 - era iconography and the @entity30 and are now on display at the @entity32 in @entity33			1
according to @entity37 , the man who arranged the project , " there is very little exposure to contemporary architecture in @entity3			1
" " the architect who led this project for us drew upon his own thoughts and experiences , " he added			2
unsurprisingly , the career path of an architect in @entity3 is very structured			1
" all architects ( in @entity3 ) are trained at the @entity47 and all work for the government			1
there are no private projects , " @entity37 continued			2
" in a way , it 's not much different than working for a council -- limited projects , but the better you are the more chance you have of working on more interesting projects , and the more chance of influencing design			2
" some designs appear more rooted in reality than others which take big leaps into what the architect believes may be possible in the future			2
the image above shows a hotel and gondola on the @entity72 in the port city of @entity74 , an area currently without major accommodation facilities			0
exhibiting slightly more blue - sky thinking , this image depicts a flying house that can double up as a hovercraft			0
combining the old and the new , meanwhile , this nifty - looking bridge is designed to connect the famous mountains of @entity82			0
people walking across it in the morning will be high above the early mist providing the sensation of floating above the clouds , the architect said			0
" apart from blocks of architecture that reflect @entity29 influence , there is a certain futuristic style ( and ) modernism in many of the buildings " in @entity3 , @entity37 said			1
in the image above , visitors to a mountain villa retreat interact with each other in an atrium designed to encourage social interaction between holidaymakers			0
reaction to the exhibition has been mixed so far			0
" some people see it as retro and kitsch , while others see it as inventive , fun and with some valid ideas , " @entity37 said			0
" it was never intended as anything more than a visual brainstorm -- a way to stimulate engagement , ideas and discussion			0
" the designs will be on display at the @entity122 at the @entity32 until november while @entity15 will be running a seven day architecture trip to @entity3 in late october .			1

a tour group asked @entity3 designers to come up with their visions of the future
the results depict a mixture of @entity29 style and futuristic *technology*
images are currently on display at the @entity32
