whether on the hunt for yourself or , more likely , looking for a gift for a friend or family member , the decision is n't an easy one			0
both @entity15 's @entity16 and @entity18 's @entity17 hit stores in the past week or so , and both are off to huge starts			1
each sold more than 1 million units in their first 24 hours			0
@entity24 -- the third player in console gaming 's @entity26 -- has its year - old " next generation " console , the @entity28 , to consider as well			1
to be sure , there are lots of factors to consider when making a choice			2
but if you 're trying to decide which box should end up under the tree , take a look at some thoughts what we see as a big advantage for each console			2
you 'll want a @entity16 if ... you want a solid social gaming machine offering intricate , beautiful games that players can share easily with friends			1
the next generation of consoles has more power than its predecessors , so games look more robust and offer expanded environments of play and more intricate detail			2
in " @entity55 , " the @entity16 's power is on display when hundreds of tiny relics form in a mystical creature with animation that 's near - @entity61 quality			1
the dualshock 4 controller contains new features that work very well for some games			2
the touchpad offers a new way to interface with gameplay			2
in " @entity68 : @entity74 , " a swipe across the pad activates different features for your robotic companion			0
a social sharing button directly on the controller allows players to let others see their accomplishments			0
video clips , screenshots and direct broadcasts are available through @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 and @entity86 right out of the box			0
it also should be mentioned that at $ 399 , the @entity16 is $ 100 cheaper than the rival @entity17			1
when disc games are $ 60 and download games run $ 15 , the money saved could be used to get the content you want			0
you 'll want an @entity17 if ... you are in the market for a multimedia machine that can multitask and switch between games , movies , music and applications quickly and seamlessly			1
easily the best thing about the @entity17 ( so far ) is how quickly the new interface switches from one application to another with just a voice command ( via an improved @entity106 )			1
the hands - free controller not only works for games , it changes the channels on your tv , serves up movie content or uses the @entity113 function to do two things at once			2
snap allows for split - screen multitasking on the fly			0
say you are watching the local @entity119 game through the @entity17 , but you want to know how your fantasy football team is doing			2
snap brings up a web browser in a side window to let you access your online team without missing a handoff in the game you 're watching			0
and it is all done with voice command through @entity106			0
it can recognize six voices and learns the games , shows and apps that each of those people likes			0
of course , it also can create a new power struggle for the remote control as opposing viewers scream instructions to the console			0
the @entity17 , which costs $ 499 , has an amazing suite of entertainment choices with partners like @entity144 , @entity145 , @entity146 and more			1
@entity18 wants to offer people as many television , movie and music choices as possible , and content providers are signing up			0
you 'll want a @entity28 if ... you want a wider selection of games to play now and at a price that wo n't blow away your entire holiday budget			1
lest we forget , the @entity28 is also a next - generation gaming console			1
it has the advantage of having been on the market for more than a year			0
developers have used that time to produce quality games for all age groups			0
titles like " @entity165 , " " @entity166 " and " @entity167 : @entity168 " -- along with @entity28 versions of many highly sought - after third - party titles -- make the console more attractive compared with the limited number of titles available on the new @entity16 and @entity17			1
and the @entity28 is backward - compatible , meaning any @entity28 controllers or games you owned before upgrading to the next - gen box still work on the @entity28 u. the other next - gen consoles wo n't let you play your older games and require new controllers to use them			1
and this might be a big factor for some : @entity24 recently cut the price of the @entity28 to $ 299 , making it $ 100 less than the @entity16 and $ 200 less than the @entity17			1
for what 's been promoted as as a family - friendly console , that price difference could be important as holiday spending gets tighter			1
plus , the extra money can be used to buy games .			0

console gamers have lots of choices this holiday season
the @entity16 has dynamic graphics , improved controllers and *middle* - of - pack pricing
@entity17 is an entertainment *hub* with a smooth interface
@entity28 is most *affordable* and has a year 's worth of games to choose from
