-- you could envy @entity2 a lot of things			1
starting with her rocking body , which is on full display one hot morning when the 28 - year - old @entity8 -- winning actress shows up for our chat at a caf√© in @entity12 , @entity13 , absolutely killing it in cutoff jeans shorts and a paper - thin white t - shirt			1
then there 's her red - hot career -- her fourth season playing telepathic waitress @entity19 on the @entity20 hit " @entity21 " debuts this month			1
and what about her recent marriage to hunky co-star @entity24 ? but after our day with @entity2 , we long most for her amazing energy			1
this is a girl who likes her workouts hard , her coffee " giant , " and admits that she does n't like to sit still			1
after @entity24 drops her off and takes their two dogs to the park , @entity2 dishes about everything from the pressure to stay thin in @entity38 to whether she sees " @entity21 " kiddies in her future			1
q : you started out acting and got an @entity8 for " @entity44 " at such a young age			1
how did you turn out so , well , sane ? i have a really , really , really normal family			1
and by normal i mean we 're all nuts on some level			1
i think you 've got ta be a little nuts to pursue any kind of creative job			1
i was also a really good kid			1
i know that sounds really dull , but i did n't rebel in the traditional sense			1
@entity0 : secrets to a stress - free , happy , healthy family q : in what areas of your life are you healthiest -- and less so ? well , i could probably drink less coffee and drink more water			1
i try to eat well , but sometimes you can be a little too obsessive			1
it 's good to remember it 's actually not the be-all and end - all , and if you 're absolutely falling down with exhaustion , really , do you need to go to the gym ? i 'm very hard on myself			1
so i 'll be inclined to go until i hit a wall and collapse , or someone is like , " mmm , stop			1
" contrary to what you believe , you are not actually superhuman			1
as i get older , i 'm learning to balance that stuff better			1
not focus on one thing at the expense of everything else			1
sometimes it 's like , walk away from the elliptical machine			1
because you 'll be in a better mood			1
@entity0 : 7 steps to instant calm q : your character is a tough cookie			1
were you already like that ? i 've always been a tough cookie			1
i just did n't do it in short shorts and a blonde ponytail			1
i mean , if you 're going to be spending literally every single day of your working life wearing clothes that barely cover your body , you 're gon na be extra-diligent			1
i 've always been pretty diligent			1
just that , there 's just a little extra motivation of , " hmmm , teeny white shorts and a bikini top ? i think i will go to pilates this morning			2
" q : what do you love doing ? my favorite workout by far is boxing			2
it 's so much fun			2
you do a full proper boxing workout			2
you start jumping rope , and you do the pads , where your trainer calls out the combinations and you do them			2
@entity0 : punch off the pounds q : any other workouts you 're into ? i do @entity118			2
then there 's also this place called @entity121 , and they do [ @entity123 ]			2
it 's like @entity118 , but it 's , like , 105 degrees			2
it 's psycho , but kind of awesome			2
you sort of want to die immediately			2
i generally have this , well , if i did n't leave sort of hating life a little , i did n't get my money 's worth			2
q : what do you think of diets ? are you a fan of them ? i think , generally , most people ca n't maintain anything that 's particularly strict for very long			2
i watch people trying and failing to do that a lot			2
look , if you have something coming up like a vacation , and you want to look great and you 're doing it for a specific [ reason ] , or in my case , if they take your clothes away from you at work every couple of weeks			2
but i do n't know if it 's really right for your body to jump up and down weight-wise			2
q : so when you have a shoot where they 're taking your clothes away , do you have a go - to method ? [ @entity154			2
] you know , i feel it would be slightly irresponsible for me to discuss my crash - dieting methods ! you do what any normal person does when you realize you 're going to be on camera naked			0
but it does n't make me particularly pleasant to be around			0
@entity0 : how to cheat on your diet -- and still lose weight q : the grouch comes out ? it 's what we at work call " hangry			0
" on set , lunch is usually six hours after crew call			0
but hair , makeup , wardrobe , and actors usually come in a few hours before crew call			0
so by the time lunch comes around , the girls get a little what we call " hangry			0
" most of the boys start stuffing their faces the second they get to work , and most of the girls are not really morning eaters of the , like , 5 a.m. variety			0
so by one , two in the afternoon ... a little hangry			0
q : how do you know you 're at your happy weight ? i do n't know that there is such a thing			0
i think the numbers game gets a little treacherous			0
q : do you have a scale ? i do			1
truthfully , i 'm usually happiest when i 'm not going anywhere near it			1
but you know what size your body is			0
and if you 're working out and have a lot of muscle , you 're going to weigh more			0
i feel good when i feel like i 'm really strong			1
and that 's not necessarily when i 'm at my numerically most gratifying weight			1
i think there 's also a really big difference between looking healthy and being healthy			0
people in this town have a weird tendency to say , if someone 's lost weight , " @entity215 , you look amazing			0
" and you 're like , " i just had my tonsils out and did n't eat for three weeks			0
" literally , i had my tonsils out last year			0
you 're on a liquid diet so , of course , you lose weight			0
but it 's not healthy			0
@entity0 : 25 shocking celebrity weight changes q : you got married last august			0
how has marriage changed you ? it 's amazing			0
] and it should be legal for everyone			0
q : the two of you obviously spend a lot of time together			0
do you ever get sick of each other ? no. i miss him when he leaves			0
that 's nauseating , i know			0
my me - time requirements are quite small			0
q : do you think you 'll make little " @entity21 " kiddies ? not yet , [ but ] of course			1
if , @entity244 , if i can			0
@entity0 : a top doc reveals 8 fertility misconceptions q : you juggle so much			0
when do you ever relax ? i take baths			0
i 'll bring my laptop and watch a dvd			0
or , um , company in the bath			0
q : do you have a favorite place in your house ? you know , i really like our bed			0
] i 'll leave it at that			0
