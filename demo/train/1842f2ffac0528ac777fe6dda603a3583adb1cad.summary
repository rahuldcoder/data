-- the number of people who have fled @entity5 and registered as refugees amid the country 's civil war was to surpass 3 million friday , and a further 6.5 million are believed to be displaced within the war - torn nation , the @entity2 refugee agency said			1
that means almost half of all @entity5 have been forced to leave their homes amid the roughly three - year conflict , and one in eight has fled across the border , the agency said			1
in terms of scope and budget , the @entity2 's effort to help the @entity5 refugees is the largest in the agency 's 64 - year history , spokesman @entity18 said			1
" the @entity5 crisis has become the biggest humanitarian emergency of our era , yet the world is failing to meet the needs of refugees and the countries hosting them , " @entity26 , the @entity2 high commissioner for refugees , said in a news release friday			1
the data come a week after the @entity2 said it had documented the killings of 191,369 men , women and children in @entity5 from march 2011 , when an uprising began , to the end of april this year			1
the uprising began with mostly peaceful protests against the regime of @entity5 president @entity47 in @entity49 province			2

" most of the refugees are in countries neighboring @entity5 , including @entity79 ( 1.14 million ) , @entity80 ( 608,000 ) and @entity81 ( 815,000 )			2
governments estimate that hundreds of thousands more are in their countries but unregistered , putting a strain on their economies , the @entity2 said			0
donors have given more than $ 4.1 billion to help , but more than $ 2 billion more is needed by the end of 2014 , including to help more than 2.4 million people prepare for the winter , the @entity2 said			2
more than 80 % of the refugees are struggling to make a living in communities outside of camps , and more than a third are living in substandard shelters , the @entity2 said			1
" the response to the @entity5 crisis has been generous , but the bitter truth is that it falls far short of what 's needed , " @entity26 said			0

the @entity105 peacekeepers were detained thursday morning near the @entity5 town of @entity148 , the location of the border crossing that rebels had captured , according to the @entity2			1
@entity118 fighters and other @entity5 rebels seized control of the @entity5 side of the @entity148 crossing wednesday , a capture that represents a new dynamic in a war long feared not only for its deadly effects inside @entity5 but for threatening to widen into a destabilizing regional conflict			2
