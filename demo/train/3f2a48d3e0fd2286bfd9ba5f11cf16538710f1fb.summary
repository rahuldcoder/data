@entity0 , @entity1 -- a @entity4 contractor who killed two @entity1 men was released from jail wednesday after compensation was paid to the victims ' families , the result of an intense diplomatic tug - of - war that strained ties between the @entity15 and its all - important ally @entity1			1
@entity17 -- who has now left @entity1 , according to a @entity15 official not authorized to speak for attribution -- had been in jail since january			1
but the families of two men he killed forgave him , a government official said wednesday			2
" the families of the victims ... have pardoned @entity17 , " said @entity23 , the @entity15 ambassador to @entity1			1
" i am grateful for their generosity			0
i wish to express , once again , my regret for the incident and my sorrow at the suffering it caused			0
" the @entity15 official told @entity2 that @entity17 is now in @entity32 , @entity33 , for medical examination and rest			1
@entity17 ' wife in @entity38 was notified of @entity1 's decision soon after his departure from there , the source said			1
the episode illustrated @entity15 consternation with @entity1 , and initially sparked rage in the @entity46 nation over the killings			1
the @entity15 -- pressuring its key ally in the fight against @entity50 and the @entity51 to release @entity17 -- at one point sent sen. @entity53 to @entity1 to meet with officials there , and members of @entity56 told @entity1 leaders that billions of dollars in @entity15 aid were in jeopardy unless @entity17 was released			1
it is not known who paid the compensation to the families , and there are conflicting reports over the amount			1
a lawyer closely connected to the case said the compensation was $ 1.4 million , but @entity70 province law minister @entity69 said $ 2.34 million was paid to the legal heirs by the @entity15 government			1
the @entity15 official not authorized to speak for attribution insisted that the release of @entity17 was a decision made by the @entity1 , and that there was " no quid pro quo " between @entity78 and @entity0			1
the official refused to comment on whether there was a exchange of so - called " blood money			0
" it was @entity1 officials who worked with the family in making the arrangements for what is referred to as " blood money , " the official told @entity2			2
the @entity15 " did not sit across from the families " to work out an arrangement , but the official acknowledged there were " interagency discussions and a policy decision " -- in other words a @entity94 sign off -- for the @entity15 to agree to the arrangement , the official said			1
secretary of state @entity96 , who said " we are very grateful " for the decision of the families that enabled @entity17 " to leave @entity1 and head home , " stressed that the @entity15 government did n't pay any compensation to the families and she would n't say whether the @entity1 or a third party did			1
" we also have a @entity105 investigation that has begun into what happened in @entity107			2
and we 've communicated our strong support for the relationship between @entity1 and the @entity15 , which we consider to be of strategic importance , " @entity108 said during a press conference wednesday			1
@entity69 first told @entity1 media wednesday that the victims ' families did not want to press charges and added soon after that @entity17 was free to go			1
the statement came just hours after the @entity15 was charged with murder in connection with the january shootings			2
@entity69 later said $ 1,169,500 was paid to 11 legal heirs of one victim and the same amount was paid to eight legal heirs of the others			0
@entity17 appeared in the @entity107 court after the payment was made and was acquitted of the charges , in accordance with an @entity129 practice known as diyat , or compensation , the lawyer said			1
" @entity144 , " a part of @entity129 law that is enshrined in @entity1 's penal code , allows victims to pardon a murderer with or without being paid " blood money , " the former chief justice of @entity1 's @entity142 , @entity143 , told @entity2			2
on a second charge , illegal possession of a firearm , @entity17 was fined $ 250 and sentenced to time already served , the lawyer noted			2
according to @entity17 , the january 27 shooting occurred after two men attacked him as he drove through a busy @entity107 neighborhood , the @entity15 @entity148 has said			1
the @entity15 had been seeking the release of @entity17 from a @entity107 jail on the grounds that he has diplomatic immunity			1
but a high court in @entity1 refused monday to decide whether the @entity4 contractor has diplomatic immunity , sending the case back to a lower court , the official @entity156 of @entity1 reported			2
the lower court had already ruled that @entity17 does not enjoy protected diplomatic status because neither he nor the @entity1 government has provided documents proving that he does			1
@entity15 officials originally said @entity17 was a diplomat and later revealed that he is a @entity4 contractor , intensifying the already highly charged situation			2
@entity1 is a key @entity15 ally in efforts against @entity50 and the @entity51 in neighboring @entity33 , and the shooting deaths outraged many @entity1			2
@entity4 spokesman @entity172 said wednesday the agency and its " @entity1 counterparts have had a strong relationship for years			0
" when issues arise , it 's our standing practice to work through them , " @entity172 said in a statement			0
" that 's the sign of a healthy partnership -- one that 's vital to both countries , especially as we face a common set of terrorist enemies			0
" the @entity105 has opened an investigation into the incident and department spokeswoman @entity189 said it " will take all necessary and appropriate law enforcement steps in our ongoing criminal investigation			0
" " due to the ongoing nature of this investigation , we are n't in a position to provide additional details at this time , " @entity193 said			0
in @entity199 , @entity38 , @entity17 ' wife , @entity198 , spoke to reporters outside the couple 's home			0
she appeared relieved and animated about her husband 's possible return home within the next week or so			0
she told reporters that she would n't cry but she became tearful when she spoke about how @entity15 government officials supported her , even staying in contact on @entity209 and the couple 's anniversary			0
the couple met at @entity213 , @entity214 , she said			0
" everybody laughs about my intuition but i just knew in my gut that he would be home , " @entity215 said			0
while in jail , he sent her letters saying , " ' i love you			0
' this is not something he would wish on his worst enemy , " she said			0
" it was n't a pleasant thing , but it could have been so much worse , " @entity215 said			0
@entity2 's @entity229 , @entity230 and @entity231 and journalists @entity232 and @entity234 contributed to this report			0
