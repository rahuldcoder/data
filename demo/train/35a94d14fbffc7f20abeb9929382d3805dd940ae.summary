@entity0 , @entity1 -- a car bomb rocked a stronghold of the @entity6 militant group @entity5 on tuesday morning , injuring dozens of people in a southern suburb of the capital			1
fifty - three people were hurt in the blast in the @entity14 neighborhood , @entity1 health minister @entity10 told @entity5 's @entity15			1

@entity42 's conflict stirs up old rivalries in @entity1 many of the injuries were minor , caused by glass debris , said @entity47 , director general of @entity48 , where many of the wounded were taken			1
tensions have risen in recent months as thousands of fighters from the militant @entity6 group @entity5 have poured across the border into @entity42 and thousands of @entity42 refugees have fled into @entity1			1
with @entity5 's support , forces loyal to @entity42 president @entity56 have regained momentum in his country 's civil war			1
recently they retook what had been a rebel stronghold , the city of @entity65 , which is located on a major supply route close to the @entity1 border			1
while that has helped turn the tide for @entity5 's patrons , it has also angered many in @entity1			1
among those are @entity74 , whose calls for @entity5 to be stopped have grown in volume and number in recent days			2

a big worry is that @entity42 's troubles will reopen the wounds of @entity1 's civil war , which raged from 1975 - 1990 , potentially pitting the @entity89 community , which tends to back the @entity42 rebels , against @entity5 , a powerful @entity91 militia			1
