@entity0 -- the @entity2 on tuesday rejected an appeal from a @entity5 county that had regularly opened its public meetings with @entity8 prayers			1
the church - state dispute is a victory for two @entity12 residents who brought suit against the @entity14			1
@entity15 and @entity16 were represented in their court challenge by the @entity19 and @entity20			2
" when government meetings are opened regularly with @entity8 prayer , it sends the unmistakable message that non-christians are second - class citizens in their own community , " said the rev. @entity21 , who heads @entity20 , a @entity0 - based group			0
" the @entity28 clearly forbids government to play favorites when it comes to religion			0
" court records show that 26 of 33 invocations given at the council meetings in 2007 and 2008 contained references to @entity37 , the @entity38 , or other @entity8 symbols or names			2
clergy members from the community often delivered the sectarian invocations			0
the county seat is @entity45 , one the largest cities in the state			0
a federal appeals court last year found the prayers to be an unconstitutional violation of the @entity28 's @entity51 , which forbids any government endorsement of one religion over another			1
the case is @entity12 , @entity5 , v. @entity15 ( 11 - 546 )			1
the high court also turned aside a pair of student speech cases involving off - campus activity in the digital age			1
both appeals involved school suspensions of students who engaged in cyberattacks using their home computers			0
in one appeal from northeastern @entity68 , the justices let stand a lower - court ruling in favor of an eighth - grade girl who created a fake @entity73 profile of her male principal , who was described as a " hairy sex addict " and a " pervert			1
" attached was a real photo of @entity79 of @entity80 near @entity81			0
court records show the posting was widely circulated at the school among students and faculty , and the principal eventually suspended the girl for 10 days			2
her parents , @entity89 and @entity90 , then sued and were represented by the @entity19 , which called the posting a " juvenile humor " parody			0
a federal appeals court concluded that the posting caused no substantial disruption at the school , and that officials lacked authority " to punish students for off - campus speech			2
" that same court also ruled in favor of a @entity103 - area high school student who also created a mock @entity73 profile of his principal , who was labeled as a drug user , " whore , " and " big fag			1
" but a separate appeals court had given a @entity111 a legal victory after a high school senior was punished for creating what officials called a targeted " hate website			2
" @entity117 had organized a @entity73 discussion group involving about a 100 classmates , suggesting a fellow student was a " slut " who had contracted herpes			0
@entity117 sued after she was cited for violating the county school policy on bullying and harassment			0
free speech advocates and national school coalitions separately urged the high court to intervene and resolve the conflicting rulings , but the justices gave no reason for their decision to stay out , at least in these disputes			1
" now is the time for the @entity2 to resolve the question of whether and to what extent school districts have the authority to discipline students for off - campus speech , " said @entity137 , of the @entity138			1
" as technology blurs the lines between on - campus and off - campus speech , school districts need clear guidance to be able to effectively address extreme off - campus speech that interferes with a safe and orderly learning environment			0
" in the famous " @entity153 " case from 1969 , the @entity2 ruled two @entity155 high school students could continue wearing @entity157 armbands			1
the high court established an important precedent , saying students do not " shed their constitutional rights when they enter the schoolhouse door			1
" but school administrators do retain the authority to restrict any activity that would cause a " substantial disruption " of the school 's educational mission			0
the current cases are @entity171 v. @entity172 ( 11 - 502 ) ; and @entity117 v. @entity173 ( 11 - 461 ) .			0

two @entity12 , @entity5 , residents *objected* to board meeting prayers
the @entity2 lets a lower court ruling in their favor stand
the high court also let stand rulings favoring students who posted *online*
