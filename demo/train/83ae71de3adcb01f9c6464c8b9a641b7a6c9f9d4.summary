@entity0 , @entity1 -- vice president @entity3 and @entity5 @entity4 , the man who wants his job , exchanged fire over taxes , @entity9 , national security and some animated facial expressions in their only debate before @entity14			1
here are five things we learned from thursday night : 1			2
@entity3 brought it we expected @entity4 , not @entity3 , to bring a three - ring binder full of facts and figures to the debate			1
it 's not that the data - driven @entity4 did n't show up with an arm full of his statistics ; it is just that @entity3 did so as well			1
and @entity3 's aggressive offense from the very beginning drowned out @entity4 until about 45 minutes into the debate			1
@entity3 's 36 years in the @entity29 served him well thursday night			1
who says that delivering hundreds of floor speeches on @entity32 is n't useful ? the vice president also proved wrong the critics , who predicted he was going to make a gaffe			2
in many ways , @entity3 stole a page from @entity39 's debate playbook : put your head down , charge forward and do n't stop			1
@entity39 effectively employed this strategy last week , and @entity44 was never able to recover			0
while @entity4 put up a fight last night , he , too , was unable to regain his footing			1
the many expressions of @entity3 an @entity44 - @entity3 campaign official said before the debate that the vice president 's goal was to try to compare and contrast the two competing campaigns ' vision for the future			1
whether you agree or disagree with the specifics of the @entity57 or @entity58 plans , @entity3 did a better job of selling his last night			1
it will be several days until we know if this debate has helped the @entity44 - @entity3 campaign stem the political bleeding			1
but @entity3 did what he needed to do			1
5 independent perspectives on the vp debate 2			0
too much @entity3 ? if @entity3 was on a mission to bring the fight to @entity4 , then it appeared to be mission accomplished for the vice president			1
moments into the debate , @entity3 went on the attack			1
" on @entity77 , the president said he would end the war			0
gov. @entity39 said that was a tragic mistake , " said @entity3			1
minutes later the vice president pushed back against criticism by the @entity83 congressman , saying " not a single thing he said is accurate			0
" feisty vice presidential debate sets up @entity44 - @entity39 rematch and he called other accusations by @entity4 " a bunch of stuff			1
" @entity3 went where president @entity44 would n't last week in his debate with @entity39 , bringing up @entity39 's " 47 % " controversy as well as the @entity5 nominee 's tax rate			1
and later , when @entity4 discussed president @entity96 's tax policies , @entity3 fired back : " oh , now you 're @entity96 ? " " the vice president came and showed fight			1
he showed his boss what it is to engage and engage and engage and attack and attack and attack , " said @entity2 chief national correspondent @entity100			0
" i think @entity3 did do his boss a lot of help , " agreed senior cnn political analyst @entity107 , who 's advised both @entity109 and @entity5 presidents			1
but was @entity3 too aggressive ? " i think @entity3 is an authentic person			2
they expect that , " @entity44 senior adviser @entity115 said			0
" i think that authenticity is something that people appreciate			0
" the @entity39 campaign disagreed			0
poll : debate watchers split on who won " the sighing , the eye - rolling , the grinning			0
i do n't know if the vice president knew that there was a camera on him the whole time , that there was a split screen , " senior @entity39 campaign adviser @entity126 said			0
" even if we thought he was making good points , i think that they stepped on his good points			0
he was trying to cram everything in that he could that was n't in the last debate to try and get it all out at once			0
but i do n't think he made any kind of coherent argument as to why the @entity44 - @entity3 ticket should be re-elected			2
" @entity107 agreed : " on style i think that @entity4 won the debate			2
the @entity3 dismissive laughs , the interruptions , the sort of shouting , i think that @entity4 was calmer and frankly more presidential			1
" what did debate watchers think ? seven out of 10 debate watchers in a @entity2 / @entity154 poll said that @entity3 was the aggressor			2
opinion : @entity157 , wonky @entity4 3			2
does the debate even matter ? the short answer is no. people do n't vote for vice presidents at the ballot box			0
past vice presidential debates , no matter how high the drama , have ultimately done little to move the needle in modern elections			0
not surprisingly , @entity3 's scenery - chewing performance was viewed differently by both campaigns			1
the @entity39 campaign said he looked erratic , rude and unhinged			0
the @entity44 campaign said he laid out the facts and made @entity4 look , in the spin room words of former @entity176 gov. @entity175 , " like a lightweight			2
" but a common refrain from both campaigns after the debate was that it will probably have a minimal effect on the race one way or the other			0
25 funniest tweets about the vp debate the biggest impact of the night , and the reason @entity109 were ebullient after the debate , was the base - rallying impact of @entity3 's aggressive and blustery stage presence			1
in the wake of @entity44 's wilting flower routine in last week 's debate , the full @entity3 , exasperated and angry with @entity39 and @entity4 , was just what @entity109 needed			1
how happy was team @entity44 ? campaign surrogates stayed in the spin room with puffed chests for much longer than they did in @entity200 , when they offered dubious messaging before escaping			0
the campaign immediately sent out a fundraising plea			0
president @entity44 put himself in front of cameras after landing at @entity208 to praise @entity3 's performance			1
and it was n't just the @entity44 camp			0
democratic state parties , liberal interest groups and down - ballot campaigns rushed to send out fundraising e-mails to capitalize on a fired - up base			0
you did n't see much of the same on the @entity5 side			0
the debate launched a fresh news cycle that will put a temporary halt to the " @entity222 in disarray " storylines			0
now the pressure is on president @entity44 to keep that narrative going next week in @entity227			0
first two debates could n't be more different 4			0
@entity4 rises to challenge it was arguably @entity4 's biggest task in the vice presidential debate			1
as the running mate to the @entity5 challenger , @entity4 needed to convey that he 's fit to serve should something happen to the commander in chief , that he would be acceptable to @entity236 as president			1
known as an expert on economic and budget issues , early in the debate @entity4 showed his smarts on foreign policy			2
during a discussion on troop drawdowns in @entity245 , he explained how the seasonal changes affect the fighting in @entity245			0
opinion : sports bar @entity3 vs. seminar @entity4 " the mountain passes fill in with snow			1
the @entity253 and the terrorists and the @entity255 and the @entity256 come over from @entity257 to fight our men and women			0
when it fills in with snow , they ca n't do it			0
that 's what we call fighting seasons			2
in the warm months , fighting gets really high			0
in the winter , it goes down , " explained @entity4			2
" and so when @entity271 and @entity272 came to @entity273 and said , if you pull these people out before the fighting season ends , it puts people more at risk			0
" " i think @entity4 proved himself unexpectedly competent on foreign policy , " said @entity5 strategist and @entity2 contributor @entity280 , who worked for @entity39 's 2008 presidential bid			1
" i think @entity4 met his test tonight			2
" as expected , the @entity44 campaign disagreed			0
" i think congressman @entity4 was out of his depth and showed clearly the ticket is not ready for prime time on foreign policy , and i think that was a decisive difference between the two sides , " said @entity44 campaign manager @entity286			1
so what do debate watchers think ? did @entity4 pass the competency test ? six out of 10 debate watchers in the @entity2 / @entity154 poll conducted said that @entity4 is qualified to be president			2
who won thursday 's debate ? @entity303 5			2
@entity304 moves numbers " @entity304 " is one of @entity3 's favorite biden - isms			1
he 's been saying it for decades , but not usually with the kind of gusto he showed on thursday before millions of prime time television viewers			2
soon after the debate began , when @entity4 criticized the @entity44 administration 's foreign policy , @entity3 fired back : " with all due respect , that 's a bunch of malarkey			1
" what does malarkey mean ? people apparently rushed to their computers to find out			2
" @entity304 , " it turns out , was the third - most - searched debate - related term of the night on @entity323			0
it was also trending on @entity325 for a good chunk of time			0
for the record : it 's basically the @entity331 - @entity236 term for " nonsense			1
" according to @entity323 , the other top searches during the debate were " @entity3 , " " conflating , " " who is winning the debate " and " how old is @entity4			1
" read a transcript of the debate or watch it online			0

@entity3 came armed with statistics and bluster
@entity343 also proved he had some punch in him , but was it too much ?
just what is malarkey ? @entity236 wanted to know
@entity4 meets challenge of looking like he 's ready for the job
