-- concluding its investigation into the unintended anthrax exposure at the @entity1 in @entity4 , the @entity1 says it has found another more " distressing " problem due to lab workers not following protocol			1
the @entity1 held a news conference to discuss the conclusion of its investigation friday			1
it determined that while it is " not impossible " that the staff was exposed to viable @entity14 ( anthrax ) , it is " extremely unlikely " that this happened			1
the lab workers ' health is being monitored , and they were given antibiotics as a precaution			1
no one who may have been exposed has gotten sick			2
the incident was discovered on june 13			2
the @entity1 report says the potential exposure happened between june 6 and june 13			1
a lab that had been preparing the anthrax samples for use in two other labs on the @entity1 's @entity4 campus " may not have adequately inactivated the samples			1
" that means the other labs were working with samples thought to be harmless ; therefore , workers did n't wear protective equipment they would otherwise have been using when handling such infectious material			0
procedures in two of the three labs may have exposed workers to the anthrax , the @entity1 said			1
hallway and lab areas have since been decontaminated			0
the leader of one of the labs was reassigned shortly after the incident was revealed			0
@entity1 spokesman @entity47 would not confirm the name of the person who was reassigned			1
there are three types of anthrax infection : cutaneous ( through the skin ) , inhalation ( through the lungs ) and gastrointestinal ( through digestion )			0
according to the report , the exposure happened because the lab that was handling the dangerous material initially did n't use an approved sterilization technique			1
it did n't have a written plan reviewed by senior staff to make sure all safety protocols were followed , and there was a limited knowledge of peer - reviewed literature about the process that would make it less dangerous			0
the lab also did not have a standard operating procedure that would make sure the transfer of the material would be safe			0
bottom line , " the scientists failed to follow a scientifically derived and reviewed protocol that would have assured the anthrax was deactivated , " according to @entity1 director @entity80			1
it " should have happened , and it did n't			0
" during the investigation " multiple other problems were found , " according to @entity80			0
what to know about anthrax investigators found another troubling case that involved a dangerous transfer of material			0
this happened six weeks ago			0
but what 's " most distressing , " according to @entity80 , is that he had found out about it " less than 48 hours ago			0
" in this case , a culture of nonpathogenic avian influenza , meaning a type of the flu that is not that dangerous , was unintentionally cross-contaminated with a potentially deadly kind of flu -- the highly pathogenic @entity98			0
this strain has killed millions of birds and infected over 600 people over the last decade			0
in the case of this contamination , the @entity1 says none of the lab workers were exposed to the dangerous virus			1
it was , however , shipped to a lab run by the @entity109			0
the @entity1 has closed the labs that were involved in the incidents			2
the lab where the flu contamination occurred wo n't reopen until the lab puts better safety procedures in place , @entity80 says			1
the lab involved in the anthrax incident will remain closed for such dangerous microbes until @entity80 personally approves its reopening under conditions that prevent any such mishap from happening again , @entity80 said			1
the @entity1 has also stopped moving any biological material out of its two highest - level labs while their procedures are being reevaluated			2
as a result of these problems , the @entity1 has created a high - level group of leaders who will work on lab safety issues			1
it has also started putting together an external advisory group to take a closer look at lab safety			2
and the @entity1 is carefully reviewing all the other procedures for labs working with dangerous pathogens , and it has put together a rapid - response command structure to hopefully help the labs avoid future incidents			2
" i will say that i 'm just astonished that this could have happened here , " @entity80 said			0
he stands by his labs , which are considered some of the best in the world , and he stands by his scientists			0
but he added that he is " upset , " " angry " and has lost sleep over the incidents , and he is " working around the clock " to make sure it never happens again			2
@entity1 lab leader reassigned during anthrax investigation @entity0 's @entity152 contributed to this report .			1

an investigation of an anthrax incident at the @entity1 concludes no lab workers were exposed
the investigation turned up another safety issue involving bird flu
the @entity1 director is " upset " and " angry " that it happened
