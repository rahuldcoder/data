-- @entity2 security officials are complaining that unknown attackers are interfering with the mobile phone services of members of @entity2 's parliament , making difficult political decisions about what to do about @entity10 's incursion last week into @entity11 that much harder			1
the head of @entity2 's security service said on tuesday , " i confirm that an ip - telephonic attack is underway on mobile phones of members of @entity2 parliament for the second day in row			1
" this is reminiscent of the @entity19 ( @entity19 ) attacks on @entity20 that preceded @entity10 's invasion of the country in august 2008			1
the attacks shut down several websites of @entity20 's government including the president 's			1
while the @entity28 denied any involvement , @entity20 officials accused @entity10 of being behind the attacks			1
of course , just as some states have exploited offensive cyber capabilities for their own purposes , so too has the @entity34			1
cyberattacks are double - edged swords			0
compared to mounting a conventional war they cost little in terms of blood and treasure			2
however , in the long run they may have larger unintended consequences if more and more nation states and even private groups use cyberwarfare capabilities			2
the @entity49 malware that was discovered in 2010 showed the potential of cyberattacks			0
the joint @entity34 - @entity53 operation demonstrated how the nuclear enrichment facility of @entity55 in @entity56 could be effectively disrupted using a cyberattack that interfered with @entity56 centrifuges ' capacity to enrich uranium			1
the level of sophistication of the malware was unprecedented and affected the facility even though it was " air gapped " -- disconnected -- from the public internet			0
last month came the news that @entity68 national security officials have debated since 2011 whether to target @entity70 's regime in @entity71 with cyberattacks			2
the upside : no @entity34 boots on the ground and some potentially significant harm could be done to @entity70 's military capabilities			1
the downside : what about unknown risks ? might such attacks embolden @entity71 allies like @entity56 and @entity10 to launch cyber-counterattacks against targets in the @entity34 ? the @entity49 attack on @entity56 was not an isolated event			1
a january report by the @entity88 points out that @entity56 " is the likely source of a recent series of incidents aimed at @entity93 energy companies , @entity34 banks , and @entity53			2
the most important involved a major disruption involving the destruction of data on computers used by ( oil giant ) @entity100 ...			0
" the @entity101 , a group that supports the @entity70 regime , showed the potential to undermine trust in the financial system when it hacked @entity108 's @entity107 account last year to falsely report an attack on the @entity110 , which caused the @entity111 to drop by 150 points			0
while technically not comparable to @entity49 and its effect was only temporary -- the @entity110 quickly refuted the reporting -- it nevertheless demonstrates the existence of a tool for shadowy organizations to influence events that did not exist before			0
these recent incidents underscore both the scope and the significant differences among cyberthreats : -- the actions by the @entity101 did not cause a physical effect ; they changed data and the content of @entity108 's reporting			0
-- the disruption at @entity100 was due to the destruction of computer data , but it did not cause a physical effect either			0
-- @entity49 , on the other hand , had a physical impact making @entity56 uranium enrichment centrifuges spin at a rate they were not supposed to			0
the @entity19 attacks that appear to be happening in @entity2 right now , and the type of cyberattack that the @entity34 launched against @entity56 that could at some point happen in some other form against @entity71 , raise significant moral and legal issues			1
in many ways the cyberwarfare issue is akin to the issue of the use of armed drones , which greatly reduce the number of deaths that would result from a conventional armed conflict			2
whoever launches a drone attack or a cyberattack pays no costs of the kind that would typically take place on a conventional battlefield			2
you ca n't shoot down a drone pilot or kill a computer technician launching some kind of cyberattack thousands of miles from the intended target			0
for this reason drones and cyber capabilities can also make conflict more likely as the barriers to entry to engage in either drone warfare or cyberconflict are so low			0
moreover , there is a risk that the use of drones or cyber capabilities can escalate into a conventional armed conflict			0
similarly to the case of armed drones , the @entity34 has had a large lead in its ability to mount effective offensive cyberattacks , but that advantage is unlikely to last			1
and since the @entity34 is the only superpower and among the most technologically advanced ( as well as most vulnerable ) , it must lead by example and harden cybersecurity at home and contribute to international agreements to govern the use of these powerful new tools			1
these tools that will only get more powerful as the world becomes more connected and ever - more dependent on computers .			0

@entity2 officials say phone services of members of parliament were targeted
authors : cyberattack was also reported before @entity10 invasion of @entity20 in 2008
they say attacks are easier than conventional warfare but can provoke counterattacks
@entity203 , @entity204 : @entity34 had a lead in cyberwarfare but that is likely to ebb
