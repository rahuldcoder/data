-- between your new regimen of daily workouts , volunteering , painting or whatever else you 've resolved to do more of in the @entity5 , make time for a few tech - centric resolutions			1
they 're low impact and will keep your memories and online identity safer , your mind sharper and your friendships healthier			1
here are six you can do right now			0
you 'll thank yourself later			0
back up your stuff back up your files			0
do it now , do it often , do not put it off until your hard drive suddenly and unexpectedly perishes or until your laptop is stolen from a cafe when you run to the bathroom			0
everyone will have different backup needs , but for the most basic computer backups there are a few basic options			1
you can use an external hard drive or a cloud service			1
there are services like @entity32 , which will automatically back up photos , music , documents and emails for an annual fee			0
if you have an @entity39 computer , turn on @entity40 and it will backup your files to the drive of your choice in the background			0
you also can use a cloud storage service like @entity45 or @entity46 to save a copy of select files			1
a nice @entity45 feature is that it can automatically save new photos from connected cameras or smartphones to the cloud			0
turn on 2 - factor authentication hopefully by now you know and follow all the best practices for protecting your passwords : avoid dictionary words ; use multiword pass phrases ; do n't use the same password across multiple sites ; keep it memorable but not obvious			1
but strong passwords are n't enough to keep you completely secure			0
when it comes to your important online accounts , one of the most effective security measures you can take is turning on two - factor authentication			1
two - factor authentication requires you to confirm your identity with two separate things			1
typically it 's something you know , like a password , and something you have , like your cell phone or a key fob			1
for example , when you try to log in to a @entity81 account from an unrecognized location , @entity79 will text you a code you need to enter			0
start with your e-mail accounts , which can be used to gain access to your other online accounts			1
@entity81 and @entity88 both offer two - factor authentication , but @entity90 currently does not			1
cloud storage services with two - factor include @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity94 's @entity93			1
@entity39 's @entity95 does not yet offer it			1
@entity96 has its own two - factor feature called login approvals			1
two - factor can be a hassle to use and will take some getting used to , but it 's a small inconvenience to avoid the much larger , more devastating inconvenience of being hacked			1
scan old photos we all have them			0
the stacks of old photos hidden in boxes under the bed or collecting dust in basements			0
if you do n't have digital copies of these gems , stop stalling and start scanning			2
natural disasters , floods and fires can wipe out film memories in an instant			0
to scan your images , get a flatbed scanner and place multiple images on the bed at a time			0
you can crop and retouch individual pictures later			0
if manually scanning in each old photo sounds like too big ( or boring ) of an undertaking , you can hire a company to do it for you			2
many local camera stores offer bulk - scanning services and will return your originals along with high - resolution @entity132 or jpegs on a cd or hard drive			2
and you can store copies of your photos online in case your laptop crashes ( see resolution no. 1 )			2
if you 're comfortable sending your photos away , the best option is using a company that specialize in bulk photo scanning			2
they 'll even do light retouching and repairs for older pictures , videos and slides			0
check out @entity151 or @entity152			2
step away from the smartphone if you spend most of the day with your nose buried a smartphone , tablet or computer , make an effort to break out of the digital world and interact more with the humans around you in 2013			2
do n't habitually check your online social networks while hanging out with your flesh - and - blood friends			1
on a date ? do n't even think about texting			0
( unless the date is going horribly and they 're in the bathroom and you need to arrange an emergency extraction			0
) attempt to live in the moment instead of just documenting the moment on @entity171			2
yes , that sunset will look stunning with the @entity174 filter , but it will look even better through your own eyeballs			0
there 's a time and a place for texting and e-mailing and checking @entity180			1
but this year , let 's try to leave the screens in our pockets and bags more often and engage with the world around us			1
read the tos and check privacy settings terms of service are long , boring documents filled with impenetrable legalese			1
but before you upload content or share personal information with a site , take a few minutes to read over its terms of service -- and any privacy agreements -- so you have a better idea of who owns your data and what the company can do with it			1
start with the biggies you 're probably already using such as @entity79 , @entity96 , @entity171 , @entity88 and @entity180			2
next , take a trip to your privacy settings			0
even if you had your settings just the way you wanted them a year ago , the company could have updated the controls and left some of your information exposed			2
learn something new online tech resolutions are n't all preventative measures to avoid doom and gloom			2
you can also embark on fun , self - improvement projects			1
quality classes are free and plentiful online			1
there are courses for every age , interest and attention span , from major universities and organizations			2
pick up a language , learn how to code at @entity235 or just be inspired by the best @entity236			0
@entity39 's @entity237 is stocked with videos and podcasts of classes , as well as supporting materials like worksheets and ebooks			0
you can access them from a computer or download the @entity248 or @entity249 app. @entity250 channel has instructional videos on math , business , language and the other usual suspects , including fun experiments you can try at home			0
check out the @entity259 channel and prepare to simultaneously mess with and impress your kids			0
@entity262 offers free college courses from big name universities including @entity265 , @entity266 , @entity267 , @entity268 and @entity269			1
get the knowledge without the student loans ( or course credit , unfortunately ) .			0

keep your data safe this year with backups and two - factor authentication
for a fun @entity5 's project check out the many free online courses and start learning
take a moment to read the terms of service for your e-mail , photo sites and social networks
