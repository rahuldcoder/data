-- at a time where former tennis greats are returning to the tour , there is one man whose presence looms large			2
it was always going to take something special to lure @entity9 away from the home comforts of his family and the sanctuary of the television studio			1
but with one phone call and a glimpse at a man who made him think twice , the opportunity to work with @entity18 was a challenge he could not resist			1
" i see in @entity24 a little bit of @entity9 , " the @entity21 tells @entity0 's @entity22			1
" i see him against @entity27 and @entity28 , probably the two most popular players in the world , and he does n't always get a fair deal from the crowd			2
" it makes him work even harder and more determined to win			2
i see some similarities between him and a young @entity9			1
" @entity9 began his partnership with @entity18 in december 2013 and was courtside when the @entity39 star claimed his seventh grand slam title at @entity41 in july -- one more than his coach managed during a 15 - year career			1
@entity9 , whose first of three triumphs at the @entity45 came as a raw teenager , was heavily criticized when he moved away from the microphone to become an integral part of @entity18 's coaching set up			1
his former rival @entity50 joined forces with @entity28 around the same time , while @entity52 -- another star of their era -- enjoyed a successful spell working alongside @entity56 before they split in march			2
but it was @entity9 's arrival that caught the headlines			1
the 46 - year - old says he could not turn down the offer -- especially given the similarities he saw between @entity18 , now 27 , and his younger self			1
" i live with @entity63			2
whenever he makes a mistake i feel that i make it too , " @entity9 says			1
" whenever he hits an ace , i feel like i 've hit an ace			2
" i have to keep my poker face and have a very cool demeanor			2
he 's looking at us up in the box and we have to give him confidence			2
" inside it 's a volcano , i 'm burning			2
after matches he needs to take a quiet minute to relax -- i need to take one too ! " @entity9 burst onto the scene by winning @entity41 at the tender age of 17 and repeating the feat the following year , becoming known as " @entity9 " for his ferocious serve - and - volley game			1
a @entity83 triumph in 1989 and two @entity85 crowns capped a fine career in which he won 64 @entity88 titles , earning $ 25 million in prize money			2
but since his retirement in 1999 , @entity9 's main contribution to tennis has been through his television work			1
it is something he enjoys immensely , his enthusiasm laid bare for all to see every time he picks up a microphone			2
while @entity9 received a couple of phone calls from players curious as to whether he would be willing to take up a coaching role , it was only once @entity18 got in touch that he began to consider moving back onto the circuit			1
but even then , @entity9 needed reassuring -- he had to know what was driving @entity18			1
" i have a pretty successful second career which is nothing to do with tennis or sport so i was already on the road for so many years , so i thought , why bother ? " he says			2
" but @entity63 called me and i told him i felt honored			0
i told him i appreciated that he remembered me and that i could bring something he did n't have yet			0
" i considered going back on the road but i wanted to talk to him first to see how driven he was			0
" i did n't want to spend weeks with him away from my wife and kids if he was n't driven			0
" i go on the road because i want to win the majors and not being happy with the quarters or the semis			0
he had the same mindset and that 's why i felt it was the right decision			0
" @entity9 's presence at the @entity123 sparked much interest			1
@entity18 , having won the title on each of his three previous visits to @entity128 , was dethroned by eventual winner @entity129 9 - 7 in the fifth set of their quarterfinal			1
that result sparked skepticism over @entity9 's appointment , though he dismissed that as " part of being @entity9			1
" instead , @entity9 believes the defeat to @entity129 allowed them time to assess which way they needed to go , and allowed him to begin to influence the @entity39 's game -- especially the mental side			1
defeats in the finals at @entity41 and the @entity83 in 2013 and the @entity145 had left question marks over @entity18 's morale , but @entity9 believes any doubts have since been erased			1
" i was known to be a pretty hard - nosed guy on court with a very strong mentality , " he adds			0
" i was a fighter 's player			0
maybe i was n't the quickest or most talented but i put all my character into the match			0
" maybe that was something he was looking for			0
he 's so talented and physically he 's amazing , maybe that was the one part he was lacking			0
" i think that 's why we gel and get along			0
i have something he does n't have , he certainly has things i do n't have anymore , and i think that 's a foundation of our relationship			0
" @entity18 will start his 2014 @entity83 campaign next week hoping to secure a second victory at @entity167 to his growing list of triumphs , having lost in the last two finals there			1
since @entity41 , and his wedding , top - ranked @entity18 has struggled in the @entity174 hard - court swing			1
a heavy defeat by @entity176 at the @entity177 was followed by a shock loss against world no. 18 @entity179 in @entity180 last week -- a result which has cast doubt over whether he will be ready for the final grand slam of the season			0
but with @entity27 ruled out of the tournament with injury , @entity18 will still be confident of reaching the final , especially with @entity9 by his side			1
" @entity63 is a great student given he 's someone who has won so much already , " says @entity9			1
" he 's been world no. 1 , is a multiple grand slam winner and is a very rich man			0
he really wants to learn , wants to get better and be in the history books of tennis			0
" he had a dream , coming from very humble beginnings			0
his parents gave everything for their children and he feels he has a very big responsibility to give everything he has and eventually give back to his family			0
" that 's what makes him tick			0
he 's much more mature than normal 27 - year - olds often come across as			0
" that maturity is also in evidence off the court following @entity18 's marriage to long - term girlfriend @entity209 and the imminent arrival of their first child			1
@entity9 believes fatherhood will only enhance @entity18 's game and says children can have a positive effect on a player 's psyche both on and off the court			1
" it changed me for the better , " says @entity9 , who has children by both his first and second wives			1
" it changed @entity28 for the better and gave him a new zest for life			0
a tennis player 's life is sometimes very lonely but to have your wife and kid with you sometimes gives you a better quality of life			0
" there 's something to go back to after practice or a match			0
it gave me another three or four years on my career and i think it will do the same for @entity63			0
" he 's a true family man			0
he loves his wife and family more than anything in the world , and having that addition to his family will make him a better man			0

@entity9 says he sees a lot of @entity18 in himself
says he " burns like a volcano " while watching @entity18 play
only decided to take role after long talks with @entity39 star
he says fatherhood will help @entity18 *blossom*
