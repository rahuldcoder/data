" noting the surprised look on my face as i respond to his offer , @entity5 says that @entity24 has no problem with @entity26 ( temple stay ) guests enjoying a beer with dinner			2
after all , he is n't the one drinking it			0
certain sects of @entity33 in @entity17 are n't as strict as you might find in places like @entity36 or @entity37 , where drinking alcohol near temples is forbidden , he goes on to explain			1
for another thing , ordained monks can get married here			0
according to history books , back in 1872 the incoming @entity42 declared that monks should be free to eat meat -- if given to them as an offering -- take wives and have children			0
@entity5 's father is @entity51 's temple master , as was his father and grandfather before him			2
where @entity17 @entity33 took hold of @entity18 's 117 temples , @entity51 is one of 52 that allow overnight guests			1
why so many shukubo ? located in @entity17 's @entity59 , @entity18 is a must - hit site for spiritual @entity17			1
it 's starting to grow in popularity globally , thanks to its 2004 addition to the @entity64 as one of three sacred sites in @entity17 's @entity67			1
with a population of about 3,000 people , according to town officials , it 's the center of @entity33 , a @entity73 - influenced esoteric sect introduced to @entity17 in the year 805 by a man named @entity75 , or @entity75 , one of @entity17 's most revered religious figures			1

a walk in honor of the dead as far as ancient forests and sacred mountains go , @entity18 is easily up there with the world 's best			1
every pagoda and gate is stunning , particularly the 20 structures at @entity101 , often described as the second most sacred site in @entity18			1
another beautiful site is @entity104 , @entity17 's largest rock garden			1
located in the inner courtyard of @entity88 temple , it was completed in 1984 to commemorate the 1,150th anniversary of @entity75 's ascent into eternal meditation			2
but the pinnacle of any journey to @entity18 is incredible @entity114 , the most revered site of them all			1
after crossing the @entity117 ( first bridge ) , i 'm ready to head down the two - kilometer cobblestone walkway to the @entity114 mausoleum and its @entity121 , filled with more than 10,000 lanterns			1
the walk is filled with more than 200,000 gravestones , monuments and memorials ( no bodies are buried here ) , all sharing space with @entity131 torii gates , side paths and thick forests of massive trees that tower over the trail and filter the morning sun. you could walk back and forth through that forest 100 times and still spot something you did n't notice before			1
there are monuments to historic figures , war heroes , royalty , business leaders , children and pets			0
some of the little human statues wear bibs , others tiny hats			0

at the end of the @entity114 walkway is the mausoleum of @entity75 , the man who started it all			1
every morning at 6 a.m. and 10:30 a.m. , golden - robed monks prepare a meal for @entity75 as part of a ritual that involves blessing food placed in a covered wooden box			0
the monks are oblivious to our little row of photographers			0

meditation , chants and free @entity202 back at @entity204 , it 's 7 a.m. and master @entity205 is hovering over a large book , carrying out his morning ritual in the glittery temple , which guests are invited to watch			1
joined by two other chanting monks , he prays for all the spirits enshrined at @entity204 and societal peace			0
it 's a mesmerizing scene -- the steady flow of chants are hypnotizing as curly trails of incense smoke waft into the air , punctuated by the occasional bang of a gong			2
visitors are given a printout featuring a portion of the chant , in @entity225 and @entity17 , should they wish to follow along			1
afterward , we 're served breakfast , another fabulous and fresh shojin ryori meal ( i 'd quit meat forever if i had access to this food every day ) in the temple 's historic @entity234 dining room , one of @entity59 's most revered cultural assets			2
though the temple adheres to ancient traditions , guests have free @entity202 available throughout the property , rooms included			2
this , says the temple master , is part of the secret to @entity248 's survival -- the ability to adapt and change , while still adhering to the core principles of the @entity14 faith			2
" it 's my duty as the temple master to follow all the old rituals and traditions and pass them along , " he says			2
