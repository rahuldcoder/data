the @entity0 will conduct " a comprehensive , coordinated " review into the case of sgt. @entity3 -- the recently freed soldier whom some have deemed a hero , others a deserter -- the military branch 's civilian leader announced tuesday			1
secretary of the army @entity11 began a statement on @entity3 's case by saying that " we are grateful that an @entity17 soldier is back in @entity17 hands " and insisting " our first priority is ensuring sgt. @entity3 's health and beginning his reintegration process			1
" @entity11 did n't address specific questions surrounding how the soldier ended up detained in @entity25 or what he did while in that situation			0
but he did say that the military 's review " will include speaking with sgt. @entity3 to better learn from him the circumstances regarding his disappearance and captivity			2
" " all other decisions will be made thereafter , and in accordance with appropriate regulations , policies and practices , " @entity11 said			0
authorities have n't given any indication that such a decision is coming anytime soon			0
speaking tuesday in @entity42 , @entity43 , president @entity41 said that @entity3 had not then been interrogated by @entity17 officials because he is still undergoing medical care			1
nor had he met yet with his family , according to the president			0
@entity3 -- who was released by his @entity48 captors in exchange for five prisoners held by the @entity17 at @entity51 , @entity52 -- is at @entity53 in @entity54			1
the five prisoners headed to @entity56 as part of the exchange			2
@entity3 will remain at that @entity0 medical center in @entity54 until he completes treatment , a @entity17 defense official there told @entity63			1
after that , @entity3 will return to the @entity17 and go to a @entity67 military base , the official said			1
in his statement tuesday , @entity11 suggested @entity3 's medical treatment will be a driving force in what happens next and when it does			1
" there is no timeline for this , and we will take as long as medically necessary to aid his recovery , " @entity11 said			0
@entity78 wanted tougher deal for @entity3 hailed as hero , condemned as deserter the release of @entity3 , the last @entity17 soldier held captive from the @entity85 and @entity25 conflicts , spurred celebration in many circles			1
but others challenged the move -- including some critical because he was let go in exchange for @entity51 detainees , plus many of those who served with @entity3 who characterized him as a deserter whose " selfish act " ended up costing others ' lives			1
according to firsthand accounts from soldiers in his platoon , @entity3 -- sometime before he was set to go on guard duty -- shed his weapons and walked off an observation post with nothing more than a compass , a knife , water , a digital camera and a diary			2
the team leader , @entity109 , recalled to @entity63 's @entity110 that @entity3 " did not agree with the war effort in @entity25 " and had said various things that , in retrospect , led him to believe the soldier had " walked away			1
" " it was a gut feeling i had , " @entity109 said tuesday			0
" ... when he comes up missing and all of his sensitive items are left behind , it just kind of hit us in the head			0
" at least six soldiers were killed in subsequent searches for @entity3 , according to soldiers involved in operations to find him			2
the @entity125 was not able to provide details on specific operations in which any soldiers killed during that time were involved			0
also , many soldiers in @entity3 's platoon said attacks seemed to increase against the @entity17 in @entity133 in the days and weeks following his disappearance			1
@entity109 conceded that he and others may never know if this violence was coincidental or if @entity3 gave his captors information voluntarily or after being tortured			2
yet he found it " incredibly suspicious " that attacks after @entity3 disappeared seemed to become " far more directed			2
" as to those @entity17 soldiers who died , @entity109 said , " those soldiers would not be on those patrols , in those specific areas when they were killed , unless @entity3 left			1
and that 's a fact to me			0
" all this said , the exact circumstances of his disappearance are very uncertain			0
published accounts have varied widely , from claims that he walked off the post to claims that he was grabbed from a latrine			0
noting everything that he left behind , an @entity0 fact - finding investigation conducted in the months after his 2009 disappearance concluded that @entity3 left his outpost deliberately and on his own free will , according to a @entity17 military official briefed on the report			1
the official spoke to @entity63 tuesday on the condition of anonymity due to the sensitive nature of the information			0
there was no definitive finding @entity3 deserted because that would require knowing his intent -- something @entity0 officials could n't do without talking to the soldier			1
the investigation included interviews with members of @entity3 's unit , none of whom reported seeing him go , the official said			1
in 2012 , @entity177 reported that @entity3 's unit had discipline and other issues during its time in @entity25			1
addressing the matter tuesday , @entity41 stressed that we " we do n't leave men and women in uniform behind " and insisted prisoner swaps " happen ... at the end of wars			0
" " whatever the circumstances may turn out to be , we still get an @entity17 soldier back if he is held in captivity			1
full stop , " @entity41 said			0
" we do n't condition that			0
" @entity3 team leader : he sought talks with @entity48 ' he is innocent until proven guilty ' intelligence indicated where @entity3 was being held a couple of times during his five years in captivity , a @entity17 official said			1
but any mission to get him was deemed too risky -- especially for @entity202			0
instead , the @entity17 worked through a third party to arrange a prisoner swap			2
the five @entity48 prisoners freed from @entity17 custody were transferred to @entity56 , where @entity41 said he 's confident they wo n't endanger the @entity17 on the battlefield or elsewhere			1
several factors help mitigate the risk of the exchange , two senior @entity17 officials said			2
they include : they 've been in @entity51 for a long time and therefore likely do n't have networks as extensive as they once had ; most @entity17 troops will out of @entity25 in a year ; personal assurances from @entity56 's emir to closely monitor them			1
the detainees wo n't be under house arrest , yet one @entity17 official says , " we think the @entity56 are going to keep a very , very close eye on them			1
" asked about why @entity225 was n't consulted about the exchange , the president said that over the years , the @entity227 had talked with @entity225 about the possible need for such an exchange , and that officials had to move quickly when the opportunity arose			2
" this was likely the last , best opportunity to free him , " @entity227 spokesman @entity232 told @entity63 's @entity233 , adding that " we did the right thing " in negotiating a deal much like " we exchanged prisoners " with the @entity54 and @entity237 after @entity238 as to @entity3 , he is in stable condition at @entity53 for treatment of conditions related to five years of captivity , the hospital said tuesday			2
citing privacy laws , the medical center did not provide specifics about his medical condition			0
he is undergoing a period of " reintegration " that includes decompression and help from doctors , security officers , lawyers , chaplains , his family and more , the hospital said			0
" the goal is to return him to family and society and on the path to complete recovery , " the medical center said , adding that there is no timeline for the recovery process			0
@entity11 's comments tuesday followed those of @entity272 gen. @entity271 , who stressed that questions of @entity3 's conduct is separate from the effort to recover any missing @entity17 soldier			1
" as for the circumstances of his capture , when he is able to provide them , we 'll learn the facts , " @entity271 said			0
" like any @entity17 , he is innocent until proven guilty			2
" he added : " @entity283 's leaders will not look away from misconduct if it occurred			0
" does @entity3 swap set precedent ?			0

official : @entity289 indicated @entity3 's *location* a few times , but it was too risky to get him
@entity3 was freed in exchange for 5 held at @entity51 , who are moved to @entity56
official : @entity3 left on his own but no definitive finding he deserted , probe finds
some hail the @entity17 soldier 's release , while others criticize the move
