@entity7 politics and many aspects of economic and social affairs have come to be dominated by antagonistic relationships between the country 's @entity19 populations			1
nowhere is that more evident than in @entity6			2
for all intents and purposes , @entity1 and @entity2 are now out of the control of the central government and are now ruled under the authority , to differing degrees , of @entity19 militiamen , local ( tribally influenced ) police , and extremist militants from the @entity30 in @entity7 and @entity31 , or @entity32			1

arresting @entity42 , a powerful @entity19 mp from @entity2 -- and killing his brother @entity43 -- on december 28 enraged the people of @entity6			2
but the coordinated military operation to shut down the city 's expansive anti-government protest camp two days later was simply one move too far			0
most tribes issued calls to arms and demanded the withdrawal of all federal armed forces from the province			2
heavy fighting soon followed , the army withdrew personnel from all cities , and the convoys of heavily armed @entity32 militants streamed into @entity2 and @entity1 , where security resistance was quickly subdued			1
as things stand today , the army stands poised to launch a major assault on @entity1 , where @entity32 militants and local tribesmen are now the predominant force			1
meanwhile in @entity2 , @entity19 tribesmen -- particularly from the @entity69 and the @entity71 tribes -- have taken a more pragmatic approach and cooperated with local security forces in limited operations against @entity32 militants			0

2013 has been the deadliest year in @entity7 since 2008			1
much of this can be attributed to @entity32 ' rapid escalation of operations in @entity7 , which has undoubtedly been aided by its expansion into @entity31 's civil conflict in april 2013			2
and with @entity7 elections scheduled to take place in april , prime minister @entity13 is likely feeling pressure to present a strongman image , particularly to his core @entity12 constituents			0
at times in recent months , @entity13 has adopted sharply sectarian rhetoric when referring to @entity19 elements opposed to his government and has often presented the @entity19 protest movement ( including the @entity2 camp ) as inherently connected to @entity99			1
with no substantive evidence to back these claims , it increasingly appeared that " @entity99 " was being used as a political tool			0
this is not in any way to suggest @entity32 ( a structure that in fact ceased to officially be " @entity99 " in 2007 ) does not pose a threat ; quite the contrary			0
but tribes wield great influence in @entity6 , and their dominant position within local security forces -- particularly the police -- meant @entity32 had previously been restricted to an existence in the desert			2
ironically , it was probably @entity13 's crackdown on the @entity2 protest camp and the botched arrest of @entity42 that created the conditions for @entity32 militants to move into the cities			0
but they 're not the only force on the ground			0
in @entity1 , defected local police personnel and armed tribesmen opposed to the federal government arguably represent the superior force			2
for @entity13 , neutralizing the protest movement before the elections was of paramount importance			0
exploiting the threat of @entity32 in order to exert military authority over the heavily tribal @entity19 heartland of @entity6 was a bold move			2
and the deployment of large numbers of army personnel from the predominantly @entity12 provinces of @entity143 , @entity144 and @entity145 underlines the need to bring fiercely loyal forces into what will inevitably become a bloody fight			0

while the military assault on the city has been temporarily suspended to allow for tribal negotiations to take place , at least some measure of military assault appears inevitable			0
it is likely the army will employ air strikes , artillery and mortar fire in preparation for a ground assault			0
unfortunately , such tactics tend to incur heavy civilian casualties , which will only fuel greater anti-government sentiment and encourage tribal hostility			0
as @entity173 and coalition forces discovered to their grave dismay in 2004 , a siege of @entity1 wo n't end in days or weeks			1
given the inherently social - level aspect of the tribal opposition to @entity13 's government and the complexity of defeating any insurgent group in an urban environment , army forces will likely be deployed in and around @entity6 's urban centers for some time to come -- risking prolonging tensions even further in the process			1
considering the overwhelming attention given to the role of @entity32 role in this grim state of affairs , it is unsurprising that @entity173 secretary of state @entity190 has pledged to support @entity13 's offensive in @entity6 -- albeit not with troops on the ground			1
the @entity173 sent 75 hellfire air - to - ground missiles to the @entity7 military in december and has pledged to accelerate the sale of a further 100 this spring			1
@entity198 and @entity199 reconnaissance drones are also set to bolster the army 's capability to combat terrorism			0
this may be a reasonable policy on paper , but when placed within recent geopolitical dynamics in the region it risks bolstering the widespread perception within the @entity211 's @entity19 communities that the @entity173 has recently undertaken a fundamental policy shift -- now aligning with @entity12 powers at the expense of @entity19 ones			2
the september 14 deal agreed between the @entity173 and @entity217 on @entity31 's chemical weapons -- not to mention the interim nuclear deal the @entity173 signed with @entity220 two months later -- has damaged @entity173 relations with @entity222 and weakened @entity173 relations with all sectors of @entity31 's opposition			0
the provision of sophisticated military equipment to the ultimately @entity12 - commanded @entity7 military , which is deploying @entity12 loyalist forces into a hostile @entity19 tribal environment , risks further consolidating this emerging interpretation of international geopolitics			1
@entity13 may be heartened by an @entity220 offer to provide military equipment and advisory support in @entity6 -- a politically astute move by @entity220 -- but it certainly wo n't help the @entity173 dispel the perception that it has to some degree switched sides			1
for @entity13 and @entity7 , @entity32 remains an extremely concerning problem			0
@entity32 has now established an urban presence in @entity6 -- particularly in @entity1 and , to a lesser extent , in @entity2 -- that must be overthrown			1
in this situation , and indeed in many in the @entity211 , the tribes will play the role of kingmakers , and for those who have not already pragmatically sided with federal authorities , @entity13 must change the perception in @entity6 that he -- and not @entity32 -- is their bigger enemy			0
crucially , local -- and not federal -- security forces enjoy productive structural links with the tribes , and should form the backbone of any urban fighting force in @entity6 -- as already appears to be case in areas of @entity2			1
if the army launches an all - out offensive on @entity1 , @entity32 will likely be the main benefactor			2
ten years ago , the @entity173 military led two major offensives on militants in @entity1			1
while the actors may have changed or evolved since , history appears to be repeating itself			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity270 .			0

recent fighting in @entity6 province poses serious *challenge* to @entity7 government
