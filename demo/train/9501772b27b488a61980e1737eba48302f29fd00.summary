-- while @entity3 has overcome the shortcomings of his 2012 @entity5 to be an early title contender , the two - time world champion 's teammate @entity1 is facing an uncertain future after a disappointing start to the @entity10 season			1
@entity1 was again well off the pace at the @entity13 @entity12 on sunday , despite improvements to the vehicle which helped @entity3 finish second and move level on points with championship leader @entity18			1
the @entity19 suffered the embarrassment of being lapped by @entity3 and @entity23 ' race winner @entity21 , coming in 15th to leave him with just two points from the opening five rounds			1
@entity5 's team principal @entity28 publicly backed the under - performing 31 - year - old in march , but @entity1 has now been told better results will be expected when the championship resumes in @entity32 on may 27			1
" @entity1 was very unlucky , both in the race and in qualifying , " read a statement on @entity5 's official website			1
" but everyone , he more than anyone , is expecting a change of gear starting right away with the @entity41 , his second home race , given that he lives just a few hundred meters from what , as from next sunday , will be transformed into the paddock for the sixth round of the 2012 championship			1
" @entity1 's most successful year in the elite division of motorsport was in 2008 , when he was denied a first world championship crown by @entity52 's @entity51 on the final corner of the final race			1
but the former @entity56 driver has struggled to reach those heights since , partly due to a freak accident at the @entity59 which left him with a fractured skull			0
his form has also spiraled since being told to let @entity3 pass him while leading a race in @entity65 in 2010			2
the last time the first five races were won by five different drivers was in 1983 , and @entity28 believes @entity5 can be true contenders despite a lack of early - season pace			2
" it takes very little to change the hierarchy among the teams and this rule is even more true when the differences are just a few tenths or even hundredths , " he said			0
" this year , the winner will be whoever manages to bring the best technical updates to the track in the shortest time possible : staying still for just a handful of races could mean finishing out of the points , given that so many teams have proved capable of fighting for the top places			0
" we achieved our goal of making a step forward in @entity13 , but we must continue down this path , especially as the gap to the time that gave @entity51 his pole position is still too big			2
" meanwhile , @entity10 chiefs are still investigating the fire that cast a shadow over @entity23 ' first grand prix victory since 2004 and the first race victory by a @entity100 driver			1
the blaze in the @entity104 team 's garage left seven people in hospital , but a statement released by @entity23 on monday confirmed that all but one of those injured have now been released			1
" one member of the team remains in hospital in @entity13 having suffered burns in the incident , " read the statement			2
" he is stable and will return to the @entity104 within the next 48 hours to receive further medical care			0
" his family are in constant communication and he is in good spirits			0
investigations into the cause of the fire are ongoing in collaboration with the @entity124 and local authorities			0
" the team would like to thank everyone for their good wishes and support over the past 24 hours			0
" team principal @entity23 thanked the other teams for their help and support following the incident			0
" while the incident was unexpected and definitely most undesirable , it has demonstrated the genuine cohesiveness , camaraderie and spirit of co-operation that exists within the @entity10 paddock , " he said			0
" the astonishing response from the teams and other paddock personnel was immediate , unconditional and overwhelming			0

@entity5 expect @entity1 's form to improve at the @entity41
the @entity19 has *scored* just two points so far in the 2012 @entity10 season
@entity1 finished 15th at the @entity13 @entity12 and was lapped by his teammate
one person remains in hospital following the fire which *engulfed* the @entity23 garage at the race
