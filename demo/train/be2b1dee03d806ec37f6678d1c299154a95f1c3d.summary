a 21 - day quarantine for all military personnel serving in @entity2 stricken areas of @entity4 was approved by defense secretary @entity5 wednesday			1
the quarantine was pushed for by the @entity8 , @entity6 said			1
initially the measure will apply to all personnel leaving the @entity4 area			1
but @entity6 said the policy will be reviewed within 45 days			2
the policy creates a separate set of rules for military members than what the @entity17 has pushed for civilian health care workers			1
president @entity20 has argued that civilian volunteer health workers returning from aid trips to @entity4 should not be quarantined and the @entity17 has urged states not to impose their own quarantine policies			1
@entity25 , @entity20 has said , does not support the need for a quarantine			1

" it 's part of their mission that 's been assigned to them by their commanders and ultimately by me , the commander - in - chief , " the president told reporters on the @entity17 's @entity41 on tuesday			2
" so we do n't expect to have similar rules for our military as we do for civilians , " @entity20 said			1
" they are already , by definition , if they 're in the military under more circumscribed conditions			0
" the chiefs did not have new scientific or medical data about @entity2 when they pressed for @entity6 to approve the quarantine the military official said			2
" this is simply about the chiefs looking at the best way to take care of the force , the families and the communities to which they are returning , " a military official told @entity30			2
this effort " is an admittedly conservative approach , " the official said			0
in their discussions the chiefs — who each head one of the military services branches — noted that many of the @entity78 troops are young and inexperienced in any medical issues			0
there was concern they might not adhere to an informal protocol of taking their temperature twice a day on their own			0
@entity6 said wednesday that the families and communities in the @entity78 and @entity89 where the troops are located had also expressed concern			0
" they very much wanted a safety valve on this , " @entity6 said at an event in @entity93			0
rep. @entity97 , a @entity98 from @entity99 who serves on the @entity101 , said he was " encouraged " by the new policy			0
" this act will ensure that our service men and women , their families , and our communities have the confidence that every necessary precaution is taken to ensure their health and safety			0
" the @entity78 already has 1,000 troops on the ground , and that force could grow to a total of 4,000			0
" that 's the biggest group of @entity78 there , " the official said , noting that also was a factor in the chiefs thinking			0
" the chiefs believe it is better to start more restrictive and then re-assess as we get further into the @entity2 operation , " the official said			0
for now , troops will be held in quarantine at bases designated by each of the military services			1
there will be provisions for compassionate leave — allowing troops to leave quarantine if they have a family emergency such as an illness or death			1
the quarantine will also not apply to those just briefly travelling to @entity140 , or aircrews flying in an out , although everyone is told to monitor their temperatures			0

defense officials had said the quarantine for @entity152 was ordered because he and his group had traveled extensively around @entity140 , although they had no direct contact with @entity2 patients .			2
