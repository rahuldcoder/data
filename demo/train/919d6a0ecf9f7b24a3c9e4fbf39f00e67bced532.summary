-- a package of measures designed to improve the safety of the @entity5 's @entity4 have been announced by @entity5 horse racing authorities			1
details of changes to the start and modification to fences were published thursday by @entity12 and the @entity13 ( @entity13 ) following the deaths of two horses during this year 's race last april			1
" following this year 's race , our priorities were to establish the facts surrounding the incidents that occurred during the running of the race and , secondly , to review the events which led to what was an unsatisfactory start to the race , " @entity17 , director of raceday operations and regulation for the @entity13 , said in a statement			2
" we have worked closely with @entity29 and consulted widely with jockeys , trainers and legitimate welfare organizations - the @entity33 ( a @entity5 - based animal welfare charity ) and @entity35 - on a range of elements related to the race , " @entity17 added			1
these include moving the start 90 yards ( 82 meters ) away from the crowds and the grandstands			0
the objective of these changes is to create " a calmer and more controlled environment for both horse and rider , " @entity17 says			0
" we recognize that there is pressure and tension before the race and we want to alleviate that where possible , " he added			0
along with ongoing research into safer fence design , the @entity13 and @entity29 have announced alterations to @entity57 -- the fence where both synchronized and according to @entity59 were fatally injured in 2012			1
the fence which is jumped twice ( 6th and 22nd in a total of 30 ) during the race is having its landing area leveled further , while landing areas at fences four , five and 13 will also see work carried out to smooth out natural undulations			2
the number of horses allowed to enter the race will remain at 40			1
@entity35 welcomed the new commitments to course alterations			0
" we are especially encouraged by their program of work on the fences , replacing the hard cores with softer materials to make them more forgiving to the horses			2
this has the potential to make a big difference to safety , " @entity81 , chief executive of @entity35 said in a statement			0
but @entity81 was disappointed at the lack of action on the size of the field			0
" we believe that the number of fallers , unseated riders and horses being brought down by other horses in the @entity4 is too high ( 50 % in 2012 ) , @entity81 said			1
" while there is clearly no magic formula here , changes need to be made to significantly reduce the faller rate which will reduce the number of injuries , fatalities and loose horses which pose risks to themselves and others on the course			2
we believe the single most effective way of doing this is to trial a reduction in the field size -- say for three years			0
