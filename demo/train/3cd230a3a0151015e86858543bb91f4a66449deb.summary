-- " listen , we 're all * possibly * @entity4 's son , " @entity0 tweeted last week			1
the lighthearted message masterfully sidestepped gossip and scandal : his mother , actress @entity8 , divulged to @entity10 magazine that ex-husband @entity4 could " possibly " be the 25 - year - old 's father			1
it was long believed that the biological father of the @entity16 - turned - diplomat - turned - lawyer was filmmaker @entity17 , who had a relationship with @entity0 for 12 years			1
@entity0 fell out with @entity17 when it came to light that the prolifically quirky director was having an affair with one of @entity8 's adopted daughters , soon - @entity22			1
@entity17 and @entity22 later married in 1997			0
on @entity24 last year , @entity0 memorably tweeted : " @entity24 -- or as they call it in my family , happy brother - in - law 's day			1
" while this most recent questioning about paternity made headlines because of the famous parents , the circumstance can shake any family , according to psychology experts			1
families shaped by divorce and remarriage , traditional adoption , second - parent adoption , surrogacy and in vitro fertilization might mean the conversation happens more often than ever before			1
' the world opened up ' for @entity47 , 32 , of @entity48 , his life changed over a drink with a cousin in 2010			0
@entity47 and his wife were expecting their first child , and he told his cousin he was scared of the type of parent he would be because of the angry father he had known			1
" my cousin saw that i was very worried and in a distressed place , " @entity47 said			0
his cousin , sensing his angst , figured it was time to come clean : the man who had raised @entity47 was not his biological father			1
@entity47 's mother had used a sperm donor to conceive both him and his younger sister			1
" i just sat there and stared at him for nine or 10 seconds , " @entity47 said			0
" ... my life literally re-defined by fermented oats served cold by a waitress with nose jewelry named @entity77 , " he wrote on his blog less than 24 hours later in a post titled " and now for @entity72 * * * ed. " for @entity47 , there was an immediate sense of relief			1
from about age 7 , @entity47 said he and his sister would look at each other and ask : " where did we come from ? " he had a rocky relationship with his father growing up , and in 2008 , he severed ties once and for all			1
his parents , now divorced , were together for 32 years			0
" once i found out i was n't beholden to his gene , the world opened up , " @entity47 said			0
while @entity47 's and @entity0 's paternal relationships fell into the " strained " camp , experts such as @entity94 say the news can rock a family whether the parent - child relationship is good , bad or downright ugly			1
this type of news will raise issues of identity and trust , especially if other family members were in on the secret			1
" it shakes your self - awareness and sense of self to its core , " said @entity107 , a licensed clinical social worker			0
" for parents , the important thing to understand is that we get a lot of identity from who our immediate family is			2
" think about it : recreational hobbies , personality traits , even career paths often follow the suit of a parent			2
" the child starts to feel like an outsider to their family , " @entity107 said			1
@entity107 said @entity47 's sense that he " was n't destined to become the same as this person " can be freeing : " you get a clean slate for half of your biology			2
" but there will also be some uncertainty about what traits might come from a newly discovered parent			2
" it will shake your foundation , " dr. @entity143 agrees			0
" even if you suspected it before , confirming it can still be a shocker			0
" ' secrets are inherently destructive ' for parents , of course , the million - dollar question is when to deliver the news			0
" secrets are inherently destructive to families , " @entity107 said			0
" eventually they come out , and they cause a lot of havoc			0
" the debate over disclosure versus secrecy is one that adoption support groups advise should be ongoing within families -- and that the child 's age and inquisitiveness are cues for how much to make known			1
there 's no easy answer			2
" adult adoptees who grew up with secrecy talk about feeling that something was n't ' right ' about them , about feeling both betrayed and relieved when they learned the truth			0
others interpreted their parents ' reluctance to talk to mean that adoption was taboo , " @entity175 wrote in @entity177 magazine			0
@entity143 , a psychiatrist , encourages the same process for all parents who are n't biologically linked to their child			2
" err on being truthful , " she said			0
a big factor in the " when " is if the children are old enough to comprehend the implications or if they start raising questions about their identity , @entity143 said			1
if the child is really young and determined to seek out a biological tie that is n't part of his or her current life , the parents who raised the child might encourage him or her to wait a couple of years to seek out roots -- and agree to help when the time comes			2
@entity107 said innately understanding where you come from is something children begin to want to understand			2
but the age at which it 's discussed should be when they can steel themselves for rejection			1
" it is the ultimate rejection if your biological parent does n't have interest in you , " she said			2
@entity107 suggests parents be honest in their explanations , acknowledging their own fears and doubts about telling the truth			0
this is especially pertinent if a child could have been abused , mistreated or neglected in the care of a biological parent			1
" people think that they really want to know the truth ( about their biological parents ) , but they 've idealized that truth , " @entity143 said			0
the child , even as an adult , will discover and decide for him or herself what comes from nature and what 's nurtured			1
for @entity47 , who had a rough relationship with his dad , he said he felt a release of issues he thought were innate			2
but he was upset that his mother did n't tell him the truth while he dealt with his own anger issues , or when he and his wife asked about medical history before trying to have a baby			0
with a lot of processing -- therapy , that is -- his relationship with his mother is at a peaceful point , he said			0
" she thought she was doing the right thing by not telling us , and in her view , he loved us , she loved us , they were our parents -- and none of the other stuff mattered , " he said			0
" because of the way that i was raised , he 's always going to be a part of who i am -- biological or not			0

actress @entity8 revealed her son 's father might " possibly " be @entity4
