-- this fall , two student organizations at @entity2 met to discuss a simple idea : put a spotlight on reasons people might take offense to phrases and slurs used in everyday conversation			1
the result of that conversation -- the " @entity18 ? " campaign , a photo project that points out language that marginalizes sexual and gender minorities -- has been sweeping across the @entity19 and the @entity21 , @entity22 , campus			1
it comes in the midst of several photo campaigns at colleges around the country			1
at @entity29 , there was the " i , too , @entity29 " photo project that highlights the experience of its black students			1
in march at @entity37 , images of administrators in drag explored the issue of gender identity			2
@entity2 sophomores @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 , and @entity44 co-founded the project			1
@entity41 is the president of the undergraduate lgbtq group @entity46 , and @entity42 is the president of think before you talk , a group aimed at bringing awareness to the implications of offensive language			1
@entity53 and @entity44 serve on @entity55 's executive board			2
the students explained via e-mail why they got involved , and what they hope the photo campaign will accomplish			1
their responses have been edited for clarity			2
@entity42 on using the phrase ' that 's so gay ' : i thought it was important to bring awareness to the implications that these words have because having used some of [ these phrases ] in high school , i quickly realized how differently other @entity2 students perceived me [ when i commented ] , " that 's so gay			1
" one of my friends in particular would constantly question me : " what do you mean by ' that 's so gay ? ' " i realized that using the word " gay " to describe a teacher who i did n't like or an unfavorable event really did n't make sense , and i began to change the habit			2
our intention was to use personal testaments to let people personally challenge themselves , as opposed to " banning " these words			2
our desire to use the personal " i " stems from the fact that most people , after thinking about why it is so common in today 's society to equate something like " dumb " or " unfavorable " with " gay , " are quick to change their habits			2
it is not necessarily homophobic or sexist people using such words and phrases , but largely just ordinary people			2
@entity41 on why he participated : throughout elementary and middle school , i was consistently bullied by my classmates because of characteristics that others deemed " gay			2
" i was constantly called " fag " and " bitch			2
" at times , it felt as if my entire class was against me , and i can recall only one instance that somebody stood up for me			0
i would cry to my mom during the car ride home , and my schoolwork and motivation suffered			0
with help from the school counselor , i was eventually able to stand up for myself and disregard my bullies			0
in my first year [ at @entity2 ] , i was called a " fag " by one of my hall mates in the first month of school			1
i was lucky to have my friends there to intervene , but i know that not all students are as fortunate			1
i was motivated by the bystanders who were there for me that night , and this experience propelled my enthusiasm to work on the campaign			1
though i do n't have the same reaction nowadays in response to these words , i stand in solidarity with younger students who are marginalized by their classmates			1
@entity43 on how these terms impact her and others : all of these phrases impact me , whether they directly address me or not			0
i think it is important to try to be as good of a person as you can , and through conversations with my friends , i have grown to recognize the hurt these words can inflict			0
even if i am not gay , i know that calling someone a " fag " or qualifying an expression of admiration with " no homo " attaches hurtful connotations to words that are directly connected to a certain identity			0
telling me to " man up " or not be a " pussy " tells me that you believe women are weaker , more emotional and lesser than a man			0
it tells me that you think a certain way to act is the right way and anything that does not fall under the umbrella of " acceptable " behavior or emotions is something to be put down			0
this attitude , that there is a correct way to have courage , be successful , or achieve happiness , is something that i believe hurts everyone in our society , including myself			0
this campaign is not an attempt to ban words or invalidate someone 's right to free speech , but instead is an attempt to show how these words are hurtful for many			1
one comment on an article i read about our campaign explained it very nicely : you have the right to say these offensive phrases , but we also have the right to tell you why we think these phrases are hurtful			1
@entity44 on how language reflects values : i am a @entity200			1
that is the lens i bring to all the work that i do in the community here at @entity2 , in the local @entity21 community , and in my daily life			1
when i was in high school , i was the leader of the my school 's small @entity208			0
i went to a private co-ed prep school in @entity211 , @entity212 , called @entity213 , and i distinctly remember during my junior year during the day of silence i was wearing an ally sticker in support of my friends who were silent			0
in class that day , an older friend came up to me and said , ' " look , @entity44 , i respect you but you need to take that ally sticker off man			0
you 're condoning their sinful actions			0
you ca n't support them and be the leader of a @entity200 organization			0
" i was quite taken aback , and after a short dialogue i took off the sticker to avoid any further conflict			0
that experience bothered me for a while , that i did n't take a stand to tell him , " people are people and they deserve the same rights and freedom to live the way they want that you have , as well			0
@entity242 loves everyone regardless of any part of their identity that you may have deemed sinful or unworthy			0
" this campaign is not about language ; it is about what this language represents			1
the way we talk is a reflection of our beliefs and perceptions of the world and it is vital , at least for me , to examine whether what i say is in line with my values and how i view the world .			0

@entity2 students created a campaign to point out language that marginalizes others
the " @entity18 ? " campaign has taken off online
instead of *dehumanizing* others , students say , use language to build each other up
