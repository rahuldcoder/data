[ breaking news update 1:35 p.m. et ] president @entity3 knew there would be " glitches " and said ahead of time there would be problems in the october 1 rollout of a key part of his health care initiative , but " there is no question that we did not anticipate the scale of problems with the website , " @entity2 spokesman @entity1 said on wednesday			1
separately , @entity1 said the @entity19 will begin conducting daily briefings on thursday about progress toward fixing problems with the @entity23 website			1
[ @entity25 story moved at 8:56 a.m. et ] before it even launched , red flags went up about the @entity29 website			2
health insurance companies complained about it , and the site crashed during a test run			2
but nobody told the president of any of it , the nation 's health chief told @entity39			1
@entity40 said president @entity3 did n't hear that there may be problems with the sign - up portal for his signature health care law until it went live on october 1			1
that 's when the site nosedived into a technical abyss			2
@entity29 rollout : 4 reasons why in an exclusive interview with @entity39 's dr. @entity53 , the @entity19 secretary admitted that her department and the @entity2 are displeased with the technically botched website 's rollout			1
" no one could be more frustrated than i am and the president , " she said			0
the site was supposed to make it simple for people to search and sign up for new health care policies , but instead it 's been clunky and , at times , inoperable			1
and for @entity40 , that 's disappointing			2
" we 're not at all satisfied with the workings of the website , " she said			2
" we want it to be smooth and easy and let consumers compare plans			0
" @entity3 : no ' sugarcoating ' problems with website bringing the ' a-team ' a team of high - tech experts from within the government and from @entity78 is going to tackle the issues , @entity40 said			1
@entity80 , acting director of the @entity81 , will lead the team			0
so why were n't they brought in before the website launched october 1 ? " we ( had ) hoped that they had their ' a-team ' on the table " from the start , @entity40 said of the contractors and agencies responsible for the project			1
but now , she said , " we want new eyes and ears			0
we want to make sure that we get all the questions on the table , that we get all the answers and accelerate the fix as quickly as possible			0
" the secretary attributed some problems to " extremely high " volume , saying nearly 20 million people came to the @entity29 website in the first three weeks after its launch			1
yet only 500,000 people have created accounts on the website			2
and not all of them have necessarily enrolled in health care plans			2
obamacare applications near half a million it 's not like no one saw this coming			1
when the website crashed during a test run , just a few hundred users were on it			2
but the @entity3 administration went ahead with the launch			2
waiting was not an option , @entity40 said			0
report : site failed ahead of rollout " there are people in this country who have waited for decades for affordable health coverage for themselves and their families , " she said			0
opinion : obamacare a disaster that needs fixing a political lightning rod @entity40 ' comments struck some republicans as surprising and even odd			1
" at this point , she has a lot of questions to answer , and we look forward to her testimony in the @entity2 next week , " said @entity139 , a spokesman for @entity2 speaker @entity140			0
a @entity147 @entity138 leadership aide called the situation " odd			1
" " everyone was surprised by her statement that the president was unaware of the website 's failures until a few days into it , " the aide told @entity39			1
" they had been claiming that the @entity29 rollout was his top priority and that he was receiving regular updates , which was inaccurate			0
and he gave remarks on october 1 about how great it was and that people should go sign up , " the aide said			0
" assuming that he did n't know that the website did n't work , why did they let him make that speech when they knew it had crashed in testing ? did really no one recommend a delay to the president ? it just seems odd			0
" before the website 's launch , @entity138 made targeting the program a centerpiece of their agenda			1
many insisted they would n't vote to fund the entire government unless @entity29 was defunded or delayed			0
they said that the website 's woes show that the @entity3 administration and the federal government generally are n't capable of executing what the @entity138 says was an ill - advised program from the get - go			1
" @entity190 only knows how much money they 've spent , and it 's a failure , " @entity188 , the @entity147 minority leader , said sunday on @entity189			1
" the government is n't going to be able to get this job done correctly			0
" on the other side , @entity196 sen. @entity195 of @entity197 sent a letter to @entity3 asking that the open enrollment period be extended past march 31 , 2014			0
she also asked that he consider delaying assessment of a penalty to those who do n't sign up for any health insurance before the so - called individual mandate kicks in			1
even @entity3 has been critical , insisting monday that there 's " no excuse for the problems			0
" but he also said the problems should not amount to a blanket condemnation of the @entity211			0
" nobody 's madder than me about the website not working as well as it should , " @entity3 said , " which means it 's going to get fixed			1
" calls for resignation several top @entity138 -- including 2012 vice presidential nominee rep. @entity219 -- have called on @entity40 to step down due to the program 's problems			1
the secretary skirted questions tuesday about whether she 'd step down , saying only that she works " at the pleasure of the president " and is committed to her job			0
" i think my job is to get this fully implemented and to get the website working right , " she told @entity53			0
billionaire investor @entity230 stood up for @entity40 in an interview with @entity39 's @entity232 on tuesday night			1
" i am a friend of @entity40 's , and i 'm a friend of her when she 's in trouble , " he said			0
i feel sorry for her in the position she 's in			0
obviously , it 's a huge screw - up , but it will get worked out			1
" @entity40 refused to give a timetable tuesday as to when the website will be fully operational , but she insisted it 's improving every day			2
" more people are having an easier time , " she said , " and we intend to stay at this until we open the doors wide open			0
" @entity243 calls for delay of @entity29 sign - up deadline and it 's too early to call the rollout a failure , the health secretary said			1
there 's still a long time for people to take advantage in person , by calling or by using the website during the open enrollment period			2
when that six - month stretch is over , @entity40 said , people can better decide whether this part of @entity29 is a success or a failure			0

@entity19 secretary 's comments " surprising , " @entity147 @entity138 leadership aide tells @entity39
delaying the website 's launch was " not really an option , " the nation 's health chief says
she says an " a-team " of experts is coming in , 3 weeks after the website 's launch
@entity230 : " it 's a huge screw - up , but it will get worked out "
