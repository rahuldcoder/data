@entity0 , @entity1 -- a detailed and well - preserved @entity4 parade helmet -- complete with fine facial features on its face mask , tight curly hair , and a griffin - topped cap -- sold at auction thursday for 10 times its estimated amount			1
the helmet sold at @entity14 's auction house in @entity0 for 2.28 million pounds ( $ 3.6 million )			1
it had been estimated at 200,000 to 300,000 pounds ( about $ 316,000 to $ 475,000 )			1
the buyer of the helmet was not immediately known			1
the @entity18 in @entity19 , near where the helmet was found in may by a person with a metal detector , had launched a public fundraising appeal to try to procure the helmet as the centerpiece for a new @entity4 gallery			1
@entity14 's called the @entity29 helmet -- so named for the village where it was found , about 45 miles south of the @entity33 border -- an " extraordinary example of @entity4 metalwork at its zenith " and said it dates to the late 1st to 2nd century @entity38 " the @entity29 helmet sets itself apart by virtue of its beauty , workmanship , and completeness , particularly the face mask , which was found virtually intact , " @entity14 says			1
" in addition , the remarkable @entity46 - style peak surmounted by its elaborate bronze griffin crest appears unprecedented			2
" the helmet is made of two sections : the tall pointed helmet and the face mask			1
the latter has openwork eyes , which would have allowed the wearer to see during the cavalry sports events -- known as hippika gymnasia -- when it would have been used			2
the face has incised eyelashes on the upper and lower lids , herringbone eyebrows , and pierced nostrils , all framed by three rows of corkscrew curls			0
at the peak of the cap is a small griffin , seated with its wings outstretched , revealing the incised feather detail			0
its right paw is raised and rests on the rim of a small amphora			0
colorful streamers may have been attached to the helmet when it was worn , @entity14 says			1
@entity78 , a @entity4 provincial governor under @entity79 , wrote the only surviving contemporary source of information on cavalry sports events , according to @entity14			0
he describes cavalrymen divided into two teams that took turns to attack and defend , and suggests that wearing the helmets was a mark of rank or excellence in horsemanship			0
" participants would also carry a light , elaborately painted shield , and wear an embroidered tunic and possibly thigh - guards and greaves , all of which would contribute to the impressive spectacle , " @entity14 says			0
" these events may well have accompanied religious festivals celebrated by the @entity4 army and were probably also put on for the benefit of visiting officials			0
the displays would have been intended to demonstrate the outstanding equestrian skill and marksmanship of the @entity4 soldier and the wealth of the great empire he represented			1
" the helmet is one of only three that have been discovered in @entity115 complete with face masks , @entity14 says			2
the first was found in 1796 and is now at the @entity117 in @entity0 , and the other was found around 1905 and is at the @entity119 in @entity120 , @entity33			0
the helmet was offered for sale along with other antiquities , including @entity125 pottery and @entity127 and @entity128 gold jewelry			2
@entity18 said a benefactor pledged 50,000 pounds ( $ 79,000 ) toward its fundraising appeal to bring the helmet back to the region , on condition the public matched the amount			1
in all , the museum said it hoped to raise 80,000 pounds ( $ 127,000 ) in order to obtain financing from other organizations for an auction bid			2
" @entity18 's archaeology collections are extensive with a particularly important collection of @entity145 material , especially from @entity19 and the @entity147 area , " it said			0
" in the development of its collections , @entity18 prioritizes artifacts that are judged to be of high importance to the local heritage and to ensure that items remain or are returned to @entity145			0
" @entity19 was an important military center in @entity4 , when it was known as @entity155			2
the first @entity4 fort in @entity19 was built in 72 and 73 a.d. during the initial conquest of northern @entity115 , at a strategic point overlooking the confluence of two rivers , and just west of the main north - south road , which was used regularly by troops , according to the museum .			0
