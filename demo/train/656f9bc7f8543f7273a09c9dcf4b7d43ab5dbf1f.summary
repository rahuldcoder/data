starting today the next guy to text me and ask me on a date will be deleted from my cell phone -- permanently			1
want to make plans for the weekend ? wondering how my day was ? need to discuss our relationship ? call me			1
save texting for simple stuff : let 's meet at 8 p.m. ? do you like sushi ? or even , you looked so hot last night ! when it comes to texting , the @entity15 rule applies -- @entity17			1
now of course , there are times when a " @entity22 " text may be in order			1
but that rule is only acceptable if you 've gone out once or twice and had an awful experience			0
dumping or even divorcing someone via text message is just cowardice			1
it 's a punk move but it happens quite often and not just among teens , as pop star @entity32 tells us in the july issue of @entity35			1
" he 's a very smart man , and i was in love with him when i married him , " @entity36 says , of her ex-husband @entity37			1
" let 's just say i have n't heard from him since he texted me saying he was divorcing me december 31 , 2011			1
" it 's best to say good riddance to a loser like @entity37			1
because while it may be cute for teenagers to text their sweetheart all day and night , that is really no way for intelligent , confident adults to communicate			1
" people can hide themselves in a text message , " warns @entity51 , founder of @entity52 in @entity53			1
" when you talk to someone on the phone that 's when their true personality starts to shine			1
hearing someone 's voice tells you if they are positive or negative , or enthusiastic about life			2
the voice conversation is very important			2
it keeps people from hiding			0
the phone is a screener			2
" how technology has changed romance as a happily single woman , i am shocked at how many professional , attractive and otherwise intelligent men have no idea how to hold communicate effectively by phone or face to face			1
real communication often takes courage			2
it 's not easy to drop our defenses and reveal our insecurities to one another , especially if we 've gotten our feelings hurt a few times			2
but developing your emotional intelligence is a critical ingredient in all healthy adult relationships			2
a short text in the middle of the day to let someone know you are thinking of them is a sweet gesture			2
but if you imagine that sending a daily barrage of texts , such as " driving to work , heading to lunch , or just left a meeting " is a romantic way to show you are thinking of your partner , think again			0
or texting in the middle of the night			0
i once dated a 50 - something guy who thought it was romantic to send me a " good morning " text at 4:30 a.m. good grief			2
when the chime on my phone jolted me awake , i panicked : " someone must have died , " i thought			2
why else would anyone text me at this hour ? bad move			2
" texting is not the place for anything serious			0
never handle something over text that should be handled in person or over the phone			1
this just shows that you are a weakling who deserves a good slapping			0
swallow your fear , and pick up the phone			1
" says relationship expert @entity131 , author of " @entity132 -- for @entity133 ! the @entity134			0
" do n't get me wrong , no one has time to be on the phone all day every day , but i can guarantee you that if the woman you 're dating would rather text you than call , the relationship is over			1
also , it 's best to avoid needy " @entity143			0
" " this is hands - down the number one mistake people make , " says masters			0
texting is best used as a slowly developing conversation			0
and the benefit of texting is that you actually have time to think before you blast off an inappropriate message			0
i like @entity157 ' rule : " the hotter the person is , the less you should be texting them			0
" the lost art of offline dating i get it			0
i love technology and @entity165 text , tweet , tumblr , pin , and share on @entity170 with a passion			1
social networking is an integral part of my life			0
but when it comes to romance , women still need to hear your voice or look you in the eye when we 're talking			0
" [ @entity182 shows ] that about 93 % of how we make our first impressions of people within 30 seconds of meeting them is nonverbal communication -- body language , voice tone , personal appearance ... " @entity51 reminds us			0
" and relying on texting to build a relationship is a recipe for miscommunication , and premature intimacy			0
" do n't let technology turn you into a coward who is afraid of real conversation , or sharing yourself in any meaningful way			1
do n't be a @entity37			1
if you have more virtual friends on @entity170 than you do in reality , it 's time to reevaluate your life			0
get out there make a few actual friends , in person			0
but it is not nearly as complicated as many people make out -- as long as you actually like yourself first and are basically satisfied with your own life			0
i admit there is one date text i always will answer : " want to go to the @entity215 game tonight ? " now that message just might be the start of a beautiful relationship			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity221 .			1

@entity221 : it was cowardly of @entity37 to divorce @entity32 via text
@entity227 : it 's shocking how many adult men would rather text than call or meet up
she says do n't let technology turn you into a wimp who is afraid of real conversation
@entity227 : when it comes to romance , pick up the phone or talk face to face
