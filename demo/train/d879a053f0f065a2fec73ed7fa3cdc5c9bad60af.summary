airlifted to the @entity8 by helicopter , is he still a polar bear ? or is he some sort of zoo - like experiment -- a sad but perhaps unavoidable consequence of an era of melting ice and warming climates ? i posed a less - wordy version of that question to @entity22 , a biologist and polar bear expert at the @entity24			1
he recently published a paper outlining several emergency actions that likely will have to be taken soon to save the @entity8 bears			1
among @entity22 's scenarios is using helicopters to airdrop food on polar bears as their icy habitat continues to melt -- at a cost of $ 32,000 per day for the " most accessible " bears			1
( the hope is that such interventions would last days per year , not months )			2
" it 's a lot better to have some animals in the wild even if they are being supplemented in their food			1
if we were basically the sole food source for these animals , then we 're going to have some very serious issues			2
then it wo n't really be a polar bear anymore , " @entity22 said on the phone			2
" it will be a semi-wild , semi-captive , free - ranging carnivore			0
and it probably would n't do that well even if the ice started to come back " since the bear would become so dependent on the airlifted food that he may forget how to hunt			1
it 's really come to this			0
@entity22 's paper , which appeared in the journal @entity63 , has been getting lots of attention because it outlines several last - ditch ideas for saving the polar bears , including feeding them bear chow , which , as one commercial website describes it , contains " ground corn , porcine meat meal , fish meal ( menhaden ) , dehulled soybean meal , corn gluten meal , ground soybean hulls , porcine animal fat preserved with @entity79 , dried beet pulp , soybean oil , taurine , salt " and a bunch of stuff i ca n't pronounce			1
it 's packaged sort of like cat food			2
his other ideas : moving the bears northward , where the ice is less likely to melt ; euthanizing some of the bears , which he writes " may be the most humane option for individual bears in very poor condition that are unlikely to survive " ; and moving some of the polar bears to zoos			1
none of those options is easy to stomach -- and not just because of the " porcine meat meal			0
he does n't want to have to feed the polar bears , much less euthanize them			1
after 30 years of researching the @entity8 bears , he 's just being realistic			2
as the planet warms , thanks to our gas - guzzling cars and power - producing factories , the polar bear 's frozen habitat is disappearing			2
@entity8 sea ice has been declining at a rate of 13 % per decade since 1979 , according to the @entity114			1
many scientists expect summer sea ice to disappear in a matter of decades			1
polar bears live and hunt from sea ice			1
if it 's gone , they ca n't catch seals , which tend to stay far from land			0
and if the bears ca n't catch seals , they ca n't survive			2
there 's no other way around it			0
unless , maybe , you airdrop some food on them			1
but even then , something of the bear 's essence is lost			0
" it 's ridiculous , human beings feeding polar bears			1
polar bears are wild animals , " @entity139 , vice president of an @entity140 in @entity142 's @entity141 told @entity143			1
" " i would n't say i 'm ' against ' it , just skeptical about how much good it will do to them , " one commenter wrote on my @entity151 page when i asked about the subject			0
" i 'm afraid that in our haste to do good we might do more harm in the long run			0
" it 's easy to have a whiplash reaction : do n't feed the polar bears			1
it 's very @entity165 , as @entity22 put it			0
but such plans , while tragic , may be unavoidable at this point			0
the fact that such an idea is even up for consideration should be a major wake - up call -- a reminder that climate change is real and happening now			1
while some of its effects are inevitable ( some polar bear habitat absolutely will be lost , @entity22 said ) , there are longer - term solutions that could help save some of the polar - bear - ness of the polar bear			2
or at the very least , @entity22 said , they 're ideas that could save them from extinction			0
the solutions are all things you 've heard before : cut carbon dioxide emissions , use less power , walk do n't drive , live more efficiently			0
it 's not rocket science ( or , as one @entity196 user recently suggested as a replacement for that phrase , " it 's not corporate income - tax law " ) , but it will take a huge amount of political will in the @entity202 and elsewhere to make substantive changes			0
in his @entity207 address , president @entity205 called for action on climate change " for the sake of our children and our future			1
" some 35,000 people gathered in @entity215 last weekend to make similar points			0
organizers said it was the largest demonstration of its kind in the @entity202			0
meanwhile , none of the five countries with polar bears -- the @entity202 , @entity225 , @entity226 , @entity142 or @entity227 -- has a plan for responding to polar bear emergencies " caused by nutritional stress , " the scientists write in the recent paper , which is titled " rapid ecosystem change and polar bear conservation			1
" when we act and how may determine how quickly the species disappears			0
current projections do n't look good			0
researchers from the @entity238 have estimated that two - thirds of polar bears will be gone by 2050			1
for the @entity8 ice melt to make sense , all you have to do is watch this @entity245 video , from the @entity246 , which shows the puny extent of sea ice in 2012 compared with the historical average			1
with all that as the backdrop , feeding polar bears does n't sound so crazy , however sad and potentially irreversible it may be			1
and such programs do exist for other species , @entity22 said , including @entity257 condors , black bears in @entity259 and brown bears in @entity261			2
" we 're at the point where we 're going to be implementing some of these scenarios in some parts of the @entity8 , " he said , " without doubt			0
" bears just are n't as fat as they used to be , " he said , which makes them less able to live through low - sea - ice years			1
" it 's very clear when you look at the data and when you just look at the animals			0
a lot of them just do n't have that much gas left in their tank			0
" i asked @entity22 what drives him			0
he said he 's not a sentimental person -- he does n't get attached to an individual polar bear the way he does to his golden retriever			2
but when you 're in the @entity8 and you see how much the bears are struggling , it 's hard not to care about them as a group -- to want to do something to preserve their wild power			2
" i 'm still optimistic that humans will decide to deal with greenhouse gases in a realistic fashion , " he said			0
to illustrate why that 's important , he pointed me to an online video that shows the death of a young polar bear cub			2
it 's linked here but , as a @entity305 writer put it , " be forewarned : this is graphic and ghastly			0
" i would n't watch it unless you absolutely feel the need to do so			0
what 's more important is @entity22 's reaction			0
for him , the video echoed his experiences in the @entity8 , surveying bears that are struggling because of sea ice melt			1
" when you watch that , " he said , " you have to , i think , be pretty hardhearted to think that maybe humans are n't treading a little too heavily on this planet			0
" editor 's note : join @entity322 for a live video chat about how to save the polar bears on @entity325 on thursday at 1:30 p.m. et. click " rsvp " to get a reminder about the chat			1

new paper makes emergency *recommendations* for polar bears
among them : airdrop food on the bears , move them north
polar bears are *threatened* by sea ice melt and climate change
@entity331 : the *proposals* are depressing but necessary
