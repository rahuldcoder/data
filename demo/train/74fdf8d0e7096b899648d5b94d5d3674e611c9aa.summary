t + l insider video : outdoor markets @entity77 flea market , @entity78 , @entity79 all you need to know about visiting this iconic celebrity magnet east of @entity81 can be summed up in seven words : arrive at eight			1
( it 's only $ 2 more than the general admission that begins at 9 a.m. ) wear sunblock			0
( this is southern @entity79 , after all			0
that 's where you 'll find the market 's antiques booths and , beyond them , just over the two small footbridges , lower - priced odds and ends and 600 vendors of vintage clothing ; denim and dresses are a particular strength			1
if we may suggest six more words for your consideration : make - your - own - bloody - @entity105 bar ( in the food court )			1
tip : skip the areas within the stadium and to the north and east — unless you 're in the market for as - seen - on - tv gizmos and other new merchandise			1
@entity114 , @entity115 the three annual @entity114 have grown to encompass more than 20 individual shows ( known as fields ) , each with hundreds of vendors lined up along a one - mile stretch of @entity121 ( get a field - by - field breakdown at @entity123 )			1
many take the same spots season after season , and repeat visits make the experience less overwhelming			0
for a taste of the original , browse the old wooden trunks , braided rugs , and depression glass at @entity133 , run by the daughters of @entity114 founder @entity135 and held on the same field where @entity135 staged the first event back in 1959			0
tip : the @entity139 at @entity140 ( 413 - 427 - 0311 ) offers @entity142 and @entity143 shipping services for purchases you ca n't fit into your suitcase			1
@entity148 , @entity150 few @entity20 flea markets can measure up to @entity151 in terms of history : residents of this small town an hour east of @entity156 have been hauling their goods here to trade since 1850 , when everything from hunting dogs to hand tools was bartered outside the courthouse during the circuit judge 's monthly visit			1
today , the market covers more than 100 acres of land a few blocks from the original courthouse square location			0
the merchandise is more varied than ever , with vintage cowboy boots , handcrafted leather saddles , antique silver , 19th - century flow blue pottery , and homemade hot sauce among the 6,000 - plus regular stalls			1
tip : target the @entity177 building for antiques and collectibles at least 20 years old , plus air - conditioning and restrooms			2
@entity182 : the world 's coolest bazaars @entity189 , @entity4 even a gold standard like @entity3 — which draws more than 20,000 shoppers , including designers and collectors from as far away as @entity2 — sees fit to up the ante once in a while			1
in 2012 , it has rounded out its dealers of 19th - century midwestern antiques and 45 food vendors ( @entity197 's one - pound pork chops ! ) with live music , beer and wine stands , and a tented @entity201 dedicated to more trend - driven clothing , accessories , and housewares			2
the same exit of @entity206 leads to two more outstanding places to shop : @entity208 and @entity209			0
tip : pick up a program at the main gates to help navigate the booths of this 130 - acre fairground arranged like a wagon wheel , with spokes radiating out from a central point			2
@entity218 , @entity219 , @entity222 an interior decorator 's dream , and a regular resource for the likes of @entity226 alum @entity225 , @entity219 's monthly 3,300 - booth @entity218 provides consistent conditions ( two climate - controlled exhibition centers with shuttle bus transportation ) , and predictable pricing ( not quite garage - sale cheap , but less expensive than some more - famous markets )			1
you 're almost guaranteed to find heirloom - quality oil paintings , @entity236 armoires , and upholstered furniture in the mix. note : this is not the place to come for makeover projects ; most everything for sale is already rehabbed and ready to go			2
tip : print a coupon from the sale 's website for $ 1 off your admission			0
@entity182 : @entity252 's coolest museum gift shops @entity253 , @entity255 artifacts , funky lighting , midcentury modern furniture , and artwork by alums of @entity57 's @entity260 ( @entity261 , @entity262 ) are standouts at this highly curated monthly event			0
themed weekends might highlight a season ( july 's sunglass shop and manicure station ) or a holiday ( february 's love - letter - writing desk and displays of couture and jewelry )			2
on - site services include antique appraisals , lamp repair , and furniture restoration , as well as crystal and porcelain refurbishing			1
delivery of furniture more than $ 200 in value is free in the downtown area			0
tip : your $ 10 admission comes with a $ 5 refund voucher for use toward a purchase of an item worth at least $ 25 at most vendor booths			0
@entity299 , @entity79 with its unmatched user - friendliness ( free shuttles from the rear parking lot , shopping carts , an all - marble bathroom in the new @entity298 ) , it 's no wonder this 800 - vendor sale has been a northern @entity79 favorite for 15 years			2
but even stripped of those creature comforts , the 13,000 regular shoppers would still turn out for the impeccably art - directed displays of antique @entity236 furniture , @entity307 serving trays , and metal sign letters — plus views of the @entity312 skyline just across the bay			1
tip : @entity315 to the back of the market for better deals			0
that 's where the newbies and latecomers , who tend to have lower prices than the pros , are assigned to set up			0
@entity182 : @entity20 's best fall color drives @entity328 , @entity329 consider it the moveable flea			1
in high season ( april through @entity333 ) , 150 vintage / antique / artisan booths set up outdoors in the @entity58 neighborhoods of @entity336 ( saturdays ) and @entity337 ( sundays )			2
come winter , they head inside the former @entity339 , a 1929 wonder with vaulted ceilings , gold - leaf mosaics , and marble floors			2
expect vintage maps , retooled bicycles , and retired classroom furniture , along with handmade geometric jewelry , architectural salvage , and troves of used designer handbags			0
it 's a scene , to be sure , but also a great place to get inspiration for your next apartment ( or wardrobe ) makeover — and perhaps discover an untapped appreciation for kimchi - topped hot dogs			2
the related market @entity359 focuses entirely on such creative street food			0
tip : buyers here tend to be savvy — and have overlapping tastes — so do n't walk away from an item you have your eye on ; it likely wo n't be there when you return			0
@entity372 , @entity50 an anything - goes state fair spirit runs through @entity376 's weekly flea market , held on , yes , the fairgrounds every saturday and sunday — except in october , when the actual state fair is in full swing			1
a thousand vendors spread out between six buildings and several acres of fields and lots , hawking used books , bluegrass albums , @entity50 pottery , batteries , and barbecued pork			0
throw in family - friendly extras ( face - painting booths ) and access to other events ( a handbell festival , say , or a model train expo ) , and you 've got plenty of diversions for the 2.4 million shoppers the event draws annually			1
tip : weather in @entity376 is fairly mild year - round , and since much of the market is indoors anyway , there 's no reason not to dig for deals in , say , january			2
@entity407 and @entity408 , @entity409 although all the items at @entity412 's thrice - annual antiquing event must be at least 30 years old , this 1,100 - vendor bazaar is anything but stuck in the past			2
proof : while it 's always been a mother lode for old - school toys , nostalgic knickknacks , and @entity423 of all kinds , over the last few years , the event 's savvy organizers have begun catering to a new , younger audience , adding in more of what 's selling now ( @entity427 , vintage hats , ' 40s and ' 50s kitchenware )			0
tip : take advantage of @entity412 's public transportation			0
the light rail 's @entity433 will get you from downtown to the @entity437 in about half an hour			0
