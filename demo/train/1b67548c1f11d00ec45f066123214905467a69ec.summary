there could be few who would begrudge @entity2 his eventual victory in the @entity4 at @entity5			1
the @entity6 has had to battle back from double brain surgery in 2011 and career - threatening injuries two years later , only regaining his full power and long - hitting ability this season			1
all the hard work paid off as the overnight leader carded a final round 71 for 14 - under 274 -- winning by a shot from @entity17 , who carded a superb last round 65 , with another @entity6 , @entity18 , a shot further back			1
it was his first win since the @entity22 in 2008 -- the year he played in the winning @entity6 @entity24 team -- and first top three finish since 2010			0
a host of golf 's big names were set to mount a challenge , but @entity31 champion @entity30 of @entity32 could not advance with a closing 71 and finished fifth , while @entity34 slumped to a four - over 76 to close on seven - under - par. @entity36 's @entity35 was left to rue his first round 80 after which he made a stunning recovery , equaling the course record with a 62 to make an unlikely cut and then closing with weekend rounds of 68 and 69			1
it left him tied for sixth on nine - under , a remarkable comeback , and one shot clear of former champion @entity46 , who closed with a 70			0
@entity46 was also left to rue his second round 76 , which undermined his challenge , but again showed signs he was returning to the form he showed in 2012 when he went to the top of the rankings			2
but it was @entity2 who came out on top , keeping his nerve in the face of a determined challenge from veteran @entity17 , having the luxury of being able to finish with a last hole bogey -- holing the winning putt from four feet			0
the 32 - year - old from @entity63 developed vertigo in 2011 and had to have a piece of his skull removed to treat the condition			0
an allergic reaction to the operation saw him back in surgery just a month later			0
