@entity0 , @entity1 -- president @entity3 continues to loom large over @entity5 's political imagination			1
this week , @entity2 will air a documentary , " @entity9 , " based on home movies from three of @entity3 's top advisers : @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 , all of whom served time in prison			1
the film offers viewers a behind - the - scenes look at what it was like to be part of that @entity23 during one of the most turbulent periods in the nation 's recent history			1
the film joins a huge library of books , movies , documentaries , academic publications and music -- all of which have taken us into one of the most puzzling and troubling @entity5 presidencies			1
in his most recent comedy special , comedian @entity40 mocked younger @entity5 who complain about their frustration with president @entity43 , reminding them , " today people are like , ' the president 's kind of disappointing			2
' really ? our president wept like an insane person and then got on a helicopter and flew away ! " despite our fascination with @entity3 , it is remarkable how many of the important lessons from his presidency that we forget and how many of the problems that emerged in the final months of the @entity56 remain with us			1
as the nation looks back at @entity3 's legacy with this film and other anniversary commemorations that are certain to come , we would do well to think harder about four lessons from those difficult days about the problems with our government institutions and our political leaders so that we make sure to do better for future generations			1
lesson 1 : the dangers of executive power @entity3 believed firmly in the power of the presidency			1
as @entity3 later told @entity75 , " when the president does it , that means that it is not illegal			1
" at the heart of @entity56 was @entity3 's effort to obstruct an investigation into his presidency			1
even before this scandal unfolded , @entity3 had employed executive power in aggressive fashion to combat the @entity83 and federal bureaucracy			1
yet , executive power has remained extremely strong since that time			1
even though @entity83 reasserted its role in a number of areas , such as the budget , the nation 's political leaders and voters continued to accept an extraordinarily strong presidency in which members of the executive branch were able to take actions without accountability and the public was supposed to trust presidents to do the right thing			1
too often , @entity5 have learned , they did n't do the right thing			0
most recently , we have seen enormous growth of executive power since 9/11			1
the recent stories surrounding the @entity105 and the surveillance program is an important reminder of how much power we bestow on this branch of government			1
members of both parties who claim that we can trust elected officials to do the right thing might want to look back at @entity3 to remember how far the envelope can be pushed			2
lesson 2 : what @entity83 can do @entity83 has been the focus of criticism throughout @entity5 history			2
but in the @entity56 crisis , public approval of the legislative branch skyrocketed as @entity5 saw a political institution that aggressively responded to a breakdown in our system			2
as the reports emerged about what had gone on , the @entity127 stepped to the forefront of the investigation and forced administration officials to stand before the public and reveal what had happened			0
the @entity127 was also instrumental in opening the investigation to other kinds of wrongdoing that had been taking place			0
after @entity3 resigned , @entity83 approved reforms that aimed to improve the political system , some of which did create better rules for campaign finance and openness in government			1
today 's @entity83 does n't seem to have the same character			1
it is an institution where investigations are conducted primarily as partisan affairs , and @entity83 shows little interest in tackling the underlying problems -- such as campaign finance or ethics -- that are at play in key scandals that have emerged			1
nor does @entity83 show the capacity to function in the same way as the institution did during those dramatic years			2
lesson 3 : money and politics beyond the break - in , the @entity56 investigation raised all kinds of issues that disturbed @entity5 about how the political system worked			2
during the congressional hearings , there was massive evidence that the @entity170 had made policy decisions that were related to campaign contributions			0
the hearings included dramatic stories of one administration official , @entity175 , obtaining a briefcase with $ 83,000 and the president reversing policies because the milk industry made donations			0
it became clear that the lines separating policy and money were thin			0
for some time , @entity83 made the system better			2
the campaign reforms in 1974 created a system of public finance for presidential elections that vastly diminished the amount of private funds in campaigns			0
they also imposed limits on campaign contributions in presidential and congressional elections			0
although the reforms improved campaign finance for over a decade , gradually candidates and contributors found loopholes in the system			0
@entity205 decisions , starting with @entity206 ( 1976 ) undercut the power of the reforms			0
most recently , @entity209 and @entity43 decided that they would not accept the public money for their campaigns , which in turn allowed them to take as much private money as they wanted			0
today , there is a tsunami of private money flowing into our political system			0
@entity221 is dominated by fundraising			0
until the nation truly does something about how campaign finance works , we leave ourselves open to repeating the mistakes that surrounded @entity56			2
lesson 4 : investigative journalism is essential a positive change to come out of @entity56 was a new ethic of journalism			1
@entity235 and @entity236 , two reporters for the @entity234 , were a driving force behind the investigation as they discovered how the burglars in the @entity56 had links to the @entity241 to re-elect the president			2
other journalists , such as @entity245 anchor @entity244 , played a huge role in connecting the dots of this story			0
@entity235 and @entity236 became models for younger journalists , encouraging them to conduct fearless investigations into power			0
investigative journalism moved to the forefront of the profession , with younger reporters determined to find the next @entity56			1
yet today that kind of journalism is under attack			0
as @entity261 wrote in the @entity234 , there has been a dangerous trend since 9/11			0
first , many in the news industry failed to ask tough questions during the run - up to the @entity267 in 2003			0
in recent years , the @entity43 administration has dramatically increased the prosecution of suspected leakers			0
and a federal appeals court recently prohibited reporters from invoking the @entity273 to avoid testifying in cases about leaks			0
. the " very act of newsgathering , " vanden @entity261 writes , " is under siege ...			0
" unfortunately , too many of the problems that shaped @entity3 's presidency continue today and , if we do n't do something about it , we might just end up with another major scandal on our hands , of the kind that is shown in " our @entity3			1
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity289 .			2
