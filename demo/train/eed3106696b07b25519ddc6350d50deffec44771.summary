@entity1 president @entity0 and the head of the @entity5 @entity4 have slammed the " western media " over their reporting of the crowd violence that marred thursday 's @entity10 semifinal between @entity11 and hosts @entity13			1
thursday 's game saw home fans pelting @entity11 's players and supporters with bottles , rocks , broken glass and cutlery after @entity13 conceded two quick first half goals			1
the game resumed in the second half but was halted after further violence directed at @entity11 's supporters			1
according to eye witnesses the security situation was sufficiently dire that a helicopter was deployed to hover low over the stadium and scatter the rioting fans			1
there were reports of further riots in the streets around the stadium			1
several @entity39 supporters were also injured during the violence			1
one @entity39 football official described the scene as being like a " warzone			2
" chaos " in front of me was utter chaos -- angry , screaming fans			0
but there were scared , scurrying fans , too , " recalled @entity49 , a @entity39 football journalist who was in the stadium at the time			0
" i 've never played in front of anything like that and i 'd like to say sorry on behalf of my team , " said @entity13 's star player @entity53 after the match was restarted and his team had lost 3 - 0			1
" it was an odd experience -- one i 've never felt before			0
" yet on the eve of the final , @entity0 and @entity4 held a press conference where they blamed western journalists for making the violence sound worse than it was			1
" when something bad happens in @entity69 , they say it 's an error			0
when something happens in @entity71 , they begin talking about corruption , " @entity4 said , before adding that he believed " the western media are simply here to perpetuate colonization			1
" @entity0 , who will fight a @entity1 presidential election in may and is relying on @entity71 votes to secure another term of office , later seemed to endorse those remarks			0
" the media can play a role , must play a role , but they must play a role where the notions of respect and fair play are the basics , " @entity0 said			2
" today the world opens the newspapers , watches television , and sees only murders and killing , " he added			0
" we never talk about princesses marrying any more			0
" @entity0 went on to congratulate @entity13 's hosting of the tournament			0
the tiny oil rich nation , which has been severely criticized over its human rights record , stepped in at the last moment after @entity101 pulled out citing fears about the spread of the ebola virus			0
@entity13 had been fined close to $ 100,000 over the violence and ordered to pay the expenses of the 36 injured @entity39 fans			2
third place saturday saw another potential flashpoint pass without incident			2
the @entity111 beat @entity13 on penalties in the third place play off after the two teams played out a 0 - 0 draw			2
before the game several players had suggested that the tie should be played behind closed doors with no supporters			0
one player , @entity111 defender @entity122 , even suggested forfeiting the match altogether			2
" if they 're throwing this at players , @entity13 , you can have 3rd place , " he tweeted after the incident , alongside a picture of some of the objects that had been thrown from the stands			2
" i love football but prefer to live			0
" in the end the match took place under tight security with barely 500 supporters in the stadium			1
all eyes will now be on sunday 's showpiece final , which will again take place in @entity143			1
meanwhile , journalists covering the event have reacted incredulously to @entity4 and @entity0 's remarks			1
. " @entity0 's got me bang to rights , " tweeted @entity148 football journalist @entity147			0
" i for one am ashamed i reported the trouble i witnessed in @entity152 rather than seeking a marrying princess			0
