@entity0 -- as political turmoil engulfs @entity4 , @entity2 are watching closely -- and they should be : what happens in @entity4 will directly affect @entity2 in many ways			1
travel : see the pyramids along the @entity9 -- not @entity4 , with its 5,000 - year history , the pyramids and pharaohs , was always a luxury travel destination for @entity2 but the political and social violence that has wracked the country for 2Â½ years has virtually destroyed @entity4 's @entity2 tourist business			1
post-coup violence erupts in @entity4 now , the @entity20 is warning citizens not to travel to @entity4 and @entity2 citizens living in @entity4 to leave			2
it also ordered non-emergency personnel and families of @entity2 working at the @entity26 and consulate to leave			0
@entity28 : @entity2 must not fail @entity4 2			2
money @entity4 is @entity2 's closest ally in the @entity32 world and it gets $ 1.5 billion a year in @entity2 taxpayer money for military and civilian programs			1
in fact , in the last 30 years , the @entity2 has sent more foreign aid to @entity4 than to any country except @entity38			1
now , that money hangs in the balance as the @entity42 administration decides whether to call the overthrow of president @entity44 a " coup			0
" gen. @entity46 , chairman of the @entity47 , tells @entity1 : " if this were to be seen as a coup then it would limit our ability to have the kind of relationship we think we need with the @entity4 armed forces			0
@entity55 peace the @entity2 helps @entity4 because it 's one of only two @entity32 countries -- along with @entity58 -- that made peace with @entity38			1
if @entity0 pulls its aid , it could affect prospects for peace in the @entity55			0
@entity63 : @entity44 's ouster was needed so @entity4 can not ' fail ' " all of these things are tied together , " says @entity1 's @entity65			0
" the aid is tied to @entity4 's peace treaty with @entity38 , so if our aid gets cut off what happens to the peace treaty with @entity38 ? it 's a hornets ' nest and that 's why the administration is trying not to stir it too much			1
gas prices @entity4 controls the @entity77 , a crucial sea route for more than 4 % of the world 's oil supply and 8 % of seaborne trade			1
so far , the canal is running smoothly -- but increased violence could end up hitting @entity2 in the pocketbook			0
the linchpin with 83 million people , @entity4 is a cultural heavyweight in the @entity32 world			2
" the great trends that have affected the @entity2 have come out of @entity4 , " says @entity65 : everything from @entity92 nationalism of the 1950s , @entity94 fundamentalism which began in @entity4 in the 1970s -- even @entity95 has its roots in @entity4 and @entity97			2
" @entity4 is the source of all the pop music , the soap operas , the movies of the @entity32 world , " he added , " so what happens in @entity4 tends to have a much wider resonance throughout the @entity32 world			2
" until the @entity4 military ousted @entity44 , @entity4 also had a claim to fame politically : a democratically elected president and his @entity109 party			0
it was a message to the @entity94 world that democracy just might work			0
now , there 's a danger the military could violently repress the @entity109 and it , in turn , could resort to violence			0
will @entity4 's @entity109 survive ? that would make the whole @entity55 region more unstable -- a worrisome development for the @entity2 .			1

turmoil in @entity4 over past two years has virtually *halted* travel by @entity2
a pinch on oil passing through the @entity77 would hit @entity2 *drivers* at the gas pump
the most populous @entity32 country , @entity4 's *stability* is seen as key to @entity55 peace
