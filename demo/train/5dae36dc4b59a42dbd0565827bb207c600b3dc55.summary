@entity0 , @entity1 -- when @entity1 's economy minister @entity4 was quoted in @entity1 daily newspaper @entity5 over the weekend attacking the economic policies of his very own government , he knew what he was doing : pulling the pin out of a grenade			1
and he certainly seemed to have no regrets			0
@entity1 's prime minister @entity12 , appointed 147 days ago after president @entity15 ois @entity14 's @entity13 took a severe beating in local elections , was not going to take such overt rebellion kindly			1
" it 's me or him , " he is reported to have told @entity14			0
on monday morning , the whole @entity1 government presented its resignation and @entity12 was immediately asked to form a new cabinet			1
apparently savoring the effects of his political sortie , the cocky @entity27 , in a televised address from the ministry of the economy , said that he would follow into the steps of @entity32 , a kind of gentleman farmer @entity34 , who in 500 @entity36 came to represent civic virtue for his modesty and restraint			0
@entity32 was also known for his beautiful curly mane , just like @entity4			1
many observers were quick to point out that vanity , rather than political restraint , were probably what the @entity1 minister shared most with the great @entity48 senator			1
why is the @entity1 government imploding and its members at loggerheads ? it 's the economy and it is ideological			1
@entity27 , at the left of the @entity13 , advocates the end of austerity measures that supposedly kill economic growth , while @entity58 , at the right of the @entity1 socialist party , as well as president @entity14 who long dithered about what economic direction to take , both favor a more @entity66 approach , with policies focusing on reducing public deficits and corporate tax breaks			1
in fact , many people in @entity1 are asking why it took more than two years to get rid of @entity27 , whose histrionic style and interventionist mantra have made him more enemies than friends , especially in the business world			1
you may remember how he lectured @entity1 and foreign investors such as the @entity83 family and @entity84 over their plans to scale down their activities in some of their @entity1 factories			1
@entity27 has been a thorn in the side of president @entity14 ever since his appointment as minister , however he is also the symbol of @entity14 's confusing and mostly unreadable economic choices			2
when the @entity1 president finally decided back in march to reclaim some control over his unruly government , and to impose a new series of business - friendly measures , the appointment of @entity12 was seen as a coherent and strong sign that political and economic uncertainty had finally ended			1
however , @entity14 insisted that his new prime minister keep @entity27 in government and give him the economy portfolio			1
as @entity110 put it : " @entity14 calculated that the risk of a confusing economic policy was less high than that of having his firebrand left - winger sniping from the outside			0
" how wrong @entity14 was			0
in fact , @entity14 seems to have been governing @entity1 as if he was still leader of the @entity13 , trying desperately and at all costs , to hold a divided family together			2
if such strategy can work for a political party , it may be disastrous when governing a country			0
to be president and to govern is to make clear choices			0
since his arrival in power in may 2012 , @entity14 has given the country the impression of playing it by ear , steering the wheel on the right or the left as events came along			0
this has certainly not proved popular			0
with an approval rating of barely 20 % , @entity14 is one of the most unpopular presidents of the @entity134 , founded in 1958			0
will the exit of the most rebellious socialists from the government be enough for the president and his prime minister to restore some credibility and be able to implement at last a string of @entity143 measures ? if this heralds the end of @entity14 's political contradictions , this will be most welcome			2
however , the new @entity1 government , which will be announced later today , will have to convince @entity1 mps and be backed by a majority in @entity151			1
@entity27 and the anti-austerity crusaders within the socialist party may want to systematically hinder the government 's actions and force @entity14 to dissolve parliament and call for new elections			0
however , this would not necessarily be good news for the opposition , as the @entity1 right , shaken by a series of scandals , has almost disappeared from political debate			2
the facts remain that economically , @entity1 is not performing as well as expected			2
with unemployment at more than 10 % and two consecutive quarters without growth , @entity1 is not going to reach its deficit target of 3.8 % of @entity169 in 2014			2
the @entity1 government must now decide what direction it wants to take and have the courage to stay the course			1
@entity1 is not performing in a vacuum and @entity14 's ability to work in tandem with its @entity178 partners , @entity66 in particular , will prove key to a much - needed coherence			0
in fact , as @entity182 - based journalist @entity181 rightly points out : " the turmoil in @entity0 presages more battles ahead in @entity182 and between @entity187 capitals as the existential crisis that was the euro emergency turns more political			0
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity192 .			0

on monday morning , the @entity1 government presented its resignation
economic and ideological *reasons* are behind the turmoil , @entity192 says
many ask why it took so long to get rid of economy minister @entity4 , she says
@entity203 : the @entity1 government must now decide what direction it wants to take
