-- during a recent commencement address at @entity3 in @entity4 , @entity1 described the way today 's internet - powered media environment " bombards us with all kinds of content			1
" he warned students that @entity11 , @entity12 , and other popular digital gadgets can turn information into " a distraction , a diversion , a form of entertainment " rather than a means " of empowerment			2
" as soon as the president 's remarks were made public , knees began jerking throughout the blogosphere			1
one online pundit said that @entity1 sounded " like a grumpy old man			1
" another suggested that in criticizing technology he was acting like an " old fogy			2
" even the normally restrained economist magazine rushed out an editorial accusing @entity1 of " technophobia " and " @entity32			1
" by the reaction , you would have thought our blackberry - toting president had called for a return to horse - drawn carriages , outhouses , and whalebone corsets			2
instead of drawing ridicule , @entity1 's words should have drawn our attention -- and our concern			1
over the past decade , most of us have been dramatically ratcheting up the time we spend surfing the web , exchanging electronic messages , and hanging out in social networks like @entity50 and @entity51			2
at the same time , we 've been showering our kids with laptops , ipods , playstations and smartphones			0
the average @entity57 today spends more than eight hours a day peering into a screen -- tv , computer , or cell phone -- and the average teen sends or receives well over 2,000 text messages a month			1
but even as we 've been enjoying the seemingly endless bounties of the net , neurobiologists and psychologists have been carrying out studies which suggest that the way we gather information online impedes comprehension , weakens understanding , and in general hinders learning			0
worse yet , the ill effects of heavy web use appear to continue to afflict us even when we turn our computers off			1
the cognitive penalties can be particularly severe for students			0
in one revealing experiment , researchers at @entity79 divided a class into two groups			0
one group was allowed to use their laptop computers to surf the web during a lecture			1
the other group attended the same lecture but had to keep their computers closed			1
immediately afterward , the students took a test measuring how well they remembered the lecture 's content			1
the students who used their laptops performed significantly worse on the exam			0
it did n't matter , moreover , whether they surfed sites related to the subject of the lecture or unrelated sites			0
all the surfers performed relatively poorly			0
other researchers have found that students who read text with hyperlinks , as you routinely find online , end up with a weaker understanding of the material than students who read the same text in a traditional , linear format , as you 'd find in a printed book			0
each link appears to act as a little distraction , breaking the reader 's concentration			1
as the number of links mounts , comprehension diminishes further			0
the multitude of messages and other bits of information that the @entity125 fires at us , from emails to tweets to @entity50 updates , have also been found to interrupt our thoughts in a way that impedes the formation of memories and the building of knowledge			0
the more information we juggle , the less able we are to make sense of it all			0
last year , a team of @entity141 researchers reported that heavy media multitaskers have trouble concentrating even when they 're not online			1
they 're considerably less able , for example , to distinguish important information from trivial information than are people who engage in multitasking less frequently			0
" everything distracts them , " one of the researchers said of the heavy multitaskers			1
@entity155 , a leading developmental psychologist who teaches at @entity156 , warned in a 2009 @entity158 article that a growing body of scientific evidence indicates that spending a lot of time with computers , smartphones , and other such devices weakens people 's ability to think deeply , critically , and creatively			1
as we rush around the web gathering little pieces of information , we seem to be training our brains to be quick but superficial			0
only a curmudgeon would deny the many benefits that our computers and electronic networks have brought us			1
the internet and related technologies have made it much easier to stay in touch with friends and family members , to discover interesting and useful information , to express ourselves , and to collaborate with others			0
since the @entity125 was invented two decades ago , we have been celebrating these benefits -- and rightly so			0
but we 've been paying much less attention to the negative consequences of our online lives			2
the time has come for us to take a more balanced view of the net , looking at its costs as well as its benefits			0
that 's particularly true when it comes to educating our children			2
sticking a kid in front of a computer screen is probably not the best way encourage the development of a strong , creative , and supple mind			2
as president @entity1 implied , information should be a source not of distraction but of enlightenment			1
as important as it is to be able to find lots of information quickly , what 's even more important is to be able to think deeply about the information once we 've found it			2
we need to slow down .			0
