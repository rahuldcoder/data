-- gleeks have to wait another eight days to see " @entity2 's " season 4 premiere , but wednesday fans were treated to a taste of the music that the @entity7 will be serenading us with this year			1
wednesday evening , the " glee " facebook page featured a streaming presentation with five songs from the first two episodes of the season , all introduced by @entity15 ( @entity16 ) and @entity17 ( @entity18 )			1
no peeks at footage of the dance numbers for these songs , but the music was backed by stills from the new season			1
@entity0 tuned in to the stream , so if you missed it , we have the details on the music coming to the @entity33 musical show in the coming two weeks : mash - up of @entity36 's " @entity35 " and @entity38 's " @entity37 , " sung by @entity39 @entity41 's nasty new dance teacher , played by @entity39 , must have been blessed with good vocal chords as well as nice legs			1
in the most danceable song of the five @entity2 songs previewed today , this mash - up features a sultry @entity47 , who may have mastered a @entity49 accent a little better than @entity36 did			1
imagine @entity50 's " @entity51 , " sung by @entity15 ladies ( and gentlemen ! ) , prepare yourselves for some more @entity16 - induced swooning			2
@entity15 will sing this hit by the @entity58 - based up - and - coming band @entity57			2
it starts off instrumentally minimal , with one plucky guitar and some claps and foot - stomping providing the percussion			0
then the song fills out during the chorus as strings and piano come in for the winning cover			0
mash - up of @entity71 ' " boys " and @entity73 's " boyfriend , " sung by @entity15 and @entity17 time to channel your inner boy band , @entity18 and @entity16 ! for the @entity15 and @entity17 's first duet on the show , @entity2 is delivering yet another mash - up , this time bringing together the music of a longtime pop queen and today 's pop prince for the show 's second @entity71 - themed episode			1
@entity15 revealed that they were directed to make the number " as cheesy and boy band as possible			0
" he and @entity17 even gave fans tuned into the stream a " boy band pose , " chins out , eyes squinted , pouty lips slightly parted			0
let 's hope there 's plenty more where that came from when the mash - up airs next week			2
@entity71 ' " gim me more , " sung by @entity98 there 's not a lot new or innovative as far as @entity2 's cover of this song goes , but it sounds like the dance moves that accompany it will be unmissable			1
@entity105 appeared in the live stream to help introduce " gim me more , " also set for the @entity71 episode			0
he gave us this tease about the scene for this song : " we 're all dancing in it and shaking our rumpeses			0
" singing this one is @entity2 's very own @entity115 , @entity98			2
@entity118 's " @entity117 , " sung by the @entity2 cast last but certainly not least , we got to hear the song of the summer â € ” the ubiquitous " @entity117 " â € ” sung by an ensemble of @entity2 cast members			2
count on it having as much energy as a car - or plane - ful of collegiate or @entity128 athletes belting out the catchy pop song			0
@entity2 's season 4 premiere airs thursday , sept. 13 at 9 p.m. music from the new season will be available for download on @entity134 beginning tuesday , sept. 11			1
