-- @entity1 makes the college admissions process feel a lot like an @entity5 movie : plenty of drama and tension			1
and plot twists that will leave parents saying , " i did not see that coming			0
" @entity1 's new book , " @entity15 : one @entity21 's @entity20 " is part comic memoir and part parental prep guide			1
@entity1 , a senior editor at @entity22 , jokes that the book is primer on how to prevent a murder			1
" this is n't a book about how to get your kid into college , " he said			1
" it 's about how to survive getting your kid into college			1
" but with all the sage advice on navigating the potholes and mazes of college admissions , " @entity15 " also is a poignant read about parents helping their beloved son leave home and find success at a decent school			1
@entity1 chatted with @entity0 and the following is an edited transcript : @entity0 : a lot of the application process seems to be about mom and dad and not about the student			1
@entity1 : it 's sort of parenthood concentrated			1
it 's all of the ironies of parenthood put together because , of course , the job of a parent is to teach the people that you ca n't live without , to live without you			1
you sort of fulfill yourself by denying yourself			0
that 's what goes on in this college admissions process			1
you 're trying to help the kid leave you			2
there are some parents who think that 's great , but most of the parents i know feel pretty torn about that			2
on one hand i 'm writing about the struggles my son had getting through the process			2
on the other , i 'm writing about the struggles my wife and i had			0
two sides of the same coin			0
@entity0 : how much of the research and application process should be the student 's and how much should be the parents ? @entity1 : every parent and child are going to have to determine that for themselves			1
even against your best intentions , the process has a way of sucking you in			2
there are little trapdoors built into the process that demand the parent get involved			2
my son assumed the posture of one of those bodies floating face - down in that scene of " @entity101			0
" i think that was a reaction to my over-aggressiveness			0
but i knew i was going to have to poke him once in a while			0
@entity0 : does he understand now why you did what you did ? @entity1 : i really do n't know			1
i do know that he 's extremely happy where he is and he 's thriving			0
how much of that entails gratitude to his mother and father is not clear			0
he 's read the book and he has n't tried to murder me or anything , so i assume it was n't entirely offensive to him			1
i 've often thought the key to the whole process is how to keep your kid from murdering you , and how to keep from murdering your kid			2
if you can get through this thing without homicide , i think that 's a victory in itself			0
@entity0 : you write that for every piece of advice you get , there 's another piece of advice to counter it			2
@entity1 : that 's how everybody ends up			1
they may not admit it , but that 's what everybody does			0
i talk about this law of constant contradiction which seems as ironclad as anything @entity146 or @entity147 came up with			0
that 's partly because there 's so much advice out there			2
it 's almost inevitable that someone will say , " proofread your application			0
" and someone else will say , " put a bunch of typos in your application so that you can say something original			0
" the problem with a lot of the advice on the @entity164 is that it may be good , but you do n't know where it 's coming from			1
are you supposed to trust someone who calls himself @entity168 or @entity169 ? @entity0 : the problems you describe mainly concern those applying to higher - end universities , right ? @entity1 : i do n't want to sound ungrateful			2
these are high - class problems			0
the kind of craziness and frenzy that i describe is something well - to - do or prosperous people put on themselves			0
but it 's seeping down into income levels where you would n't expect it			1
a lot of this is caused by things that are very admirable , like our love for our children and our desire to see them get ahead .			0

@entity1 writes book on how to survive getting your kid in college
@entity1 : admissions process is about helping one you ca n't live without , live without you
no ironclad rules , but take advice from " @entity202 " with a grain of salt
it 's chiefly a problem for the prosperous , he admits , but other income levels deal with it , too
