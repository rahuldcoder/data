general : cuts could hurt anti-drug efforts as for the rest of the current fiscal year , the measure now set to become law reduces the impact of the $ 85 billion in forced cuts -- called sequestration -- by establishing stop - gap budgets for the departments of @entity110 , @entity111 , and @entity112 , among other things			1
by crafting new budgets for targeted departments and programs , the package resets priorities and helps better manage the draconian formula of the spending cuts			1
