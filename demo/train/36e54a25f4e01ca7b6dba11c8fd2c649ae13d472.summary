every day , millions of people like 16 - year - old @entity1 live their lives shouldering a huge emotional weight forged by fear , uncertainty and separation			2
she was only 10 years old when the reality of her family 's desperate situation hit her in the face			2
@entity12 has lived more than half his 18 years in the @entity13 , yet he still feels like an outsider			1
another undocumented immigrant -- @entity16 -- is fighting to stay in her adopted homeland and dreaming of becoming an immigration lawyer			1
as @entity21 lawmakers try to hammer out an immigration reform plan while avoiding political gridlock , millions of people find themselves caught in the middle -- suspended between two worlds -- while not really belonging to either			1
some immigrants spoke to @entity27 , giving permission to use their full names			1
others chose to withhold their last names , fearing it would affect their legal status			2
' now 's the time ' to move on immigration , @entity35 says @entity38 , 16 : she 's carrying a ' big old rock ' @entity38 was 10 years old when police pulled over her dad while he was driving near their south @entity43 home			2
she recalls crying as she frantically translated the officer 's words from @entity46 into @entity47 for her father			2
she feared her family would be deported back to @entity50 , but the officer let them go			2
the family got a second chance , but @entity1 never shook the dread that filled her that day -- the fear that she could be sent back to a country she barely remembers , or get separated from the family that she loves			2
that 's why immigration reform must happen now , she says			1
" it would be a big old rock that would be lifted from our shoulders , " she says			2
she says any policy changes should create a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants like her parents , who are agricultural workers			1
@entity38 says they came to the @entity13 from @entity50 to give their children a better life			1
last year , the @entity35 administration 's deferred action program gave her the hope of a reprieve			2
but that is n't enough , she says			2
" it 's like being out in the cold and me having the only blanket in the family			2
" @entity50 welcomes new @entity13 immigration reform push @entity12 , 18 : ' in limbo ' @entity12 has lived in the @entity13 since he was 7 , and says he identifies more with @entity13 culture than his native @entity50			1
but he feels like he 's in limbo , and it 's a constant struggle			2
" i identify myself with the @entity13 culture , " he says , " but at the same time the @entity13 society is like ' no , you 're not part of us			1
' " @entity12 says talk of immigration reform is encouraging , even though it 's a problem the president has pledged before to tackle -- and then failed to solve			1
actions speak louder than words , says @entity12 , a freshman who is studying journalism at @entity99 in @entity100 , @entity43			2
" at the end of the day , the political parties will do what they can " for votes , he says			2

" if they want to make it a little strict , that 's ok ... so they do n't think they 're giving it to us , " @entity112 says			1
immigration plan : new era of bipartisanship or political necessity ? @entity16 , 28 : it 's not just @entity153 many @entity13 connect the immigration issue to @entity153 , but it 's broader than that , says @entity157			1
she came to the @entity13 from the @entity160 island of @entity161 when she was just 14			1
now , she 's fighting a legal battle in court to avoid deportation			0
" i do n't think it 's a bad thing to really focus on this amazingly powerful voting bloc , " she says			0
" i do think that people need to look at immigration from a lens that shifts from just ' those @entity50 just coming across the border ' to the many people from @entity172 and from @entity173 who are still stuck in the system			0
" the government should stop deporting people , she says , and focus on fixing a broken system that leaves many people in limbo even when they follow the rules			0
" everyone talks about going to the back of the line being the number one thing that undocumented immigrants should do			1
i have been in several different lines			0
