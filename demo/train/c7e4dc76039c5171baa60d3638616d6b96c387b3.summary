-- @entity1 is terminally ill ; @entity2 is an ordained minister			1
they and other members of @entity6 's murderous " family " now shun him			1
a new photo of @entity6 shows his gray beard and the swastika tattooed into his forehead			1
after three decades behind bars , @entity6 family members @entity1 , @entity2 , @entity12 and @entity13 have repeatedly been described as model prisoners who have accepted responsibility for their crimes			1
parole boards , however , continue to reject their bids for release , and a debate rages over whether the four should ever be freed			1
the release of @entity6 's prison photo recently rekindled public interest in slayings of pregnant actress @entity27 and six others in a two - night rampage that terrorized the city of @entity31 , @entity32 , in august 1969			1
@entity0 looked into the status of some of his former followers			0
@entity1 , @entity32 's longest - serving female inmate , requested a " compassionate release " from the @entity38 in july			1
she has terminal brain cancer , doctors say			1
the board unanimously denied her request			0
@entity1 ' 18th parole suitability hearing is scheduled for may 28 , according to a web site maintained by her husband and attorney , @entity47			1
the web site says @entity1 , now 60 , is paralyzed over 85 percent of her body and can not sit up in bed or even be moved into a wheelchair			1
despite her declining condition and spotless prison record , the site says , " there is still a very real chance the @entity54 will nonetheless insist her release would be a danger to society			1
" the @entity6 family members were initially sentenced to death , only to have their sentences commuted to life in prison when the @entity68 @entity67 struck down death penalty laws in 1972 , establishing a four - year moratorium on executions			1
by her own admission , @entity1 held @entity73 down as she pleaded for mercy , and stabbed the eight - months - pregnant woman 16 times			1
in a 1993 parole board hearing , @entity1 said @entity73 " asked me to let her baby live ... i told her i did n't have any mercy on her			1
" after stabbing @entity73 to death , according to historical accounts of the murders , @entity1 scrawled the word " pig " in blood on the door of the home @entity73 shared with her husband , director @entity90 , who was not home at the time			1
three of @entity73 's house guests were also slain , as was a teenager who was visiting the home 's caretaker in his cottage out back			2
@entity1 ' compassionate release was opposed by @entity73 's sister , @entity101 , @entity103 prosecutors and @entity32 gov. @entity104 , among others			1
however , the former prosecutor who won her conviction , @entity108 , said he supported @entity1 ' request for release			1
@entity111 told @entity0 in an e-mail she does not believe any @entity6 family member convicted of murder should ever be set free			1
she said the slayings of the victims , including some that may have not been discovered , were " so vicious , so inhumane , so depraved , that there is no turning back			0
" " the ' @entity6 ' murderers are sociopaths , and from that , they can never be rehabilitated , " @entity111 said			2
" they should all stay right where they are -- in prison -- until they die			2
there will never be true justice for my sister @entity27 and the other victims of the ' @entity6			2
' keeping the murderers in prison is the least we , as a society who values justice , can do			2
" in a manuscript posted on her web site , @entity1 , who was known within the @entity6 as @entity1 , wrote , " i will never be able to replace what my crime took away			1
and that 's not ' neat , ' and that 's not ' cool			0
' " known as @entity12 within the @entity6 , @entity12 killed coffee heiress @entity141 at the @entity73 home and , the following night , stabbed @entity143 and carved the word " war " on her husband @entity143 's abdomen			1
she remained faithful to @entity6 throughout her trial and into the first few years of her incarceration , according to a profile posted on the @entity151 web site , but she later " made strides to turn her life around			2
" now 61 , @entity12 is a model inmate at the @entity154 in @entity155 , according to lt. @entity156 , a prison spokesman			2
she is involved in the @entity158 program , which helps train puppies to be service dogs , he said			0
" it gives you a reason to wake up every morning , and keep moving on , " @entity12 told @entity31 station @entity161 , a @entity0 affiiate			0
the program at that time had trained more than 100 dogs ; @entity12 said she was training her seventh dog			0
according to the @entity171 web site , which keeps tabs on all things related to the case , @entity12 has largely accepted the fact that she probably will never leave prison			2
her next parole hearing will be sometime before december , @entity156 said			1
@entity13 was convicted in the raid at the @entity143 home , where she helped hold @entity143 down as the woman was stabbed to death			0
at the time , she was 19			0
" the autopsy reports have shown that it was @entity186 that wielded the fatal wounds , but i contributed , and i attempted to hold her down for @entity189 [ @entity12 ] , " @entity13 said in a 2002 appearance on @entity0 's " @entity183			0
" " i called to @entity186 because we could n't kill her			0
you know , it 's -- morally , i feel as though i did			0
" her conviction was overturned in 1976 , on the grounds that a judge erred in not granting a mistrial after the disappearance of her attorney , @entity199 , who later was found dead			0
in @entity13 's first retrial , the jury was unable to reach a verdict , and she was released on bond for a few months			0
but in her third trial , in 1978 , she was convicted of first - degree murder			0
known as @entity207 within the @entity6 , @entity13 , a former high school homecoming queen , is serving her life sentence at the @entity154 at @entity209 , the same facility as @entity12 and , until last year , @entity1			1
like @entity12 , @entity13 is involved in prison programs and is a mentor to other inmates in the facility 's college program , @entity156 said			2
she is also a model inmate , he added			0
during her 2002 @entity0 appearance , @entity13 called @entity6 " an opportunist of the cruelest , most vicious kind			2
" but she was quick to emphasize that she accepts blame for her role in the crime			0
like the others , @entity13 , 59 , has repeatedly been turned down for parole			0
she is widely seen as the best candidate for parole			0
but her next parole hearing probably will not be until 2010 , according to @entity156			1
" @entity2 's participation in the @entity6 murders is " a part of history that he deeply regrets , " according to a web site dedicated to his prisoner outreach program			1
@entity2 converted to @entity234 in 1975 , several years after he was incarcerated , and became an ordained minister in 1983 , according to the site			0
" he was manipulative , " @entity2 said of @entity6 in a november 2004 radio interview , the transcript of which is posted on the web site			2
" but i take full responsibility for my ignorance , lack of identity , emptiness and choices in life , which left me prey to his deceptive plan			0
my actions were my own			0
" @entity2 stabbed four people , including @entity73 , to death and fatally shot two others			0
after the @entity73 murders , @entity2 reportedly told @entity6 , " boy , it sure was helter skelter			2
" however , @entity2 was not tried along with the others in the slayings			0
a month and a half after the two - night crime spree , he said , he fled to @entity186			0
@entity2 , now 63 , writes on the site that he has no computer or internet access in prison , but maintains contact with the site administrator through the mail and writes much of the site 's content			2
@entity2 had been denied parole 13 times as of november 2006 , a correction spokeswoman said			0
