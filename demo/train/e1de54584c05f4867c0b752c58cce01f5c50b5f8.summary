we @entity0 are disgusted with our government			1
we ranked fixing " corruption in @entity4 " number 2 on @entity7 's poll of top presidential priorities in 2012			1
yet @entity4 does n't seem to care			2
neither president @entity9 or @entity10 even mentioned " corruption " as an issue that their administration would address			0
and it will take a lot more work by us to get them to pay attention			0
the first step , however , is to figure out how best to talk about the problem			0
people say the problem is " money in politics			1
" that we need to " get money out			2
" that " money is not speech			2
" that " corporations are not people			0
" these are slogans , and they 're quite effective at rallying at least some of us to the cause			0
but as slogans , they 're likely to turn off most to the right of @entity0 's center			1
and in any case , they do n't quite capture what 's gone wrong with our political system today			1
they therefore do n't point us to a plausible solution to the problem of our political system today			2
so in my @entity47 talk , i created @entity48 : imagine a country like the @entity0 , with just as many " @entity50 " as the @entity0 ( about 150,000 out of a population of more than 300 million , or about 0.05 % )			1
and imagine those @entity50 have a very special power : each election cycle has two elections			1
in one , the general election , all citizens get to vote			2
in the other , the " @entity58 election , " only " @entity59 " get to vote			0
but here 's the catch : to be allowed to run in the general election , you must do extremely well in the @entity58 election			0
you do n't necessarily need to win , but you must do extremely well			0
@entity47 : why democracy matters we all get what @entity48 would be like			0
sure , as the @entity68 said in @entity69 , " the @entity70 " of @entity48 would have the " ultimate influence " over elected officials			0
ultimate , because in the final election , the people get to vote			0
but " the @entity70 " only get to vote for the candidates who have made " the @entity50 " happy			0
and no doubt , that fact will produce a subtle , understated , somewhat camouflaged bending to keep those @entity50 happy			0
once you see @entity48 , and the corruption it creates you understand @entity0 - land , and the corruption we suffer			1
for the @entity0 is @entity48			1
like @entity48 , the @entity0 also has two elections			1
one a voting election , where citizens get to select the candidates who will ultimately govern			0
but the other is a money election , where the candidates who wish to run in the voting election raise the money they need to compete			0
as in @entity48 , the candidates do n't necessarily need to win the money election			1
but they must do extremely well			0
and here 's the stunning fact that links the @entity0 to @entity48 : there are just as few " relevant funders " in usa - land as there are @entity50 in @entity48			1
@entity47 : a plan b for the internet less than 0.05 % of us — about 150,000 @entity0 — give enough money to be even noticed by the candidates desperate to fund their campaigns			1
even that number is likely an exaggeration			0
the better number is probably closer to 50,000 @entity0 ( just about the number of " @entity113 " in @entity0 ) ( really ) now that fact alone — that we fund campaigns from a tiny slice of us — does n't necessarily create the corruption that is our @entity119			1
what does that is how the money is raised from that tiny slice of us			1
for members of @entity119 and candidates for @entity119 spend anywhere between 30 % and 70 % of their time raising money from this tiny , tiny slice of us			1
think of a rat in a @entity131 box , learning which buttons to push to get pellets of food , and you have a pretty good sense of the life of a congressman : a constant attention to what must be done to raise money , and to raise money not from all of us , but from the tiniest slice of the 1 % of us			2
and so what issues might that tiny , tiny slice of the 1 % care about ? unemployment ? out - of - control health care costs ? actually reforming @entity147 ? obviously not			1
the issues that matter to this tiny fraction of the 1 % are not the issues that matter to @entity0			1
this is the corruption of usa - land			0
and it will only ever change if we change the way we fund elections			2
@entity47 : @entity157 on laws that choke creativity members of @entity119 will always be dependent upon their funders			1
but if we adopted a system to fund campaigns like the one proposed by rep. @entity165 , @entity167 , @entity168 , then " the funders " would be " the @entity70			1
" if members raised the funds they needed from small contributions only , then many more of us would be the " relevant funders			1
" and thus when members were responsive to their " funders , " they would thus be responsive to that many more of us			0
that , after all , was the @entity179 ' original design			0
@entity180 promised us a @entity119 " dependent upon the people alone			2
" we 've got instead a @entity119 dependent upon the people and dependent upon the @entity50			2
we need to find a way back to @entity185 's original design , so that we can find a way to restore again a government that works			0
leaving @entity48 is the critical first step			0
@entity119 could do that tomorrow .			2

@entity157 : @entity0 's democracy is *hobbled* by the power of money in politics
a tiny slice of @entity0 provide funds that *largely* determine who wins *primaries* , he says
the funders of elections generally do n't share most @entity0 's priorities , he says
@entity157 : @entity119 should vote to fund campaigns through small contributions
