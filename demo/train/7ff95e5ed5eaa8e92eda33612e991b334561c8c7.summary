-- @entity2 prime minister @entity1 warned sunday that the @entity3 must establish a clear " red line " that @entity6 can not cross with its nuclear program if it wants to avoid war			1
" i think the issue is how to prevent @entity6 from completing its nuclear weapons program			0
they 're moving very rapidly to completing the enrichment of the uranium that they need to produce a nuclear bomb			0
in six months or so , they will be 90 % of the way there , " @entity1 said on @entity0 's " @entity15			1
" " i think it 's important to place a red line before @entity6 , and i think that actually reduces the chance of a military conflict because , if they know there 's a point , a stage in the enrichment or other nuclear activities that they can not cross because they 'll face consequences , i think they 'll actually not cross it , " @entity1 told @entity0 's @entity19			2
@entity36 nuclear agency expresses ' serious concern ' about @entity6 nuke activity concerns in @entity40 that @entity2 could launch a pre-emptive strike on @entity6 's nuclear facilities prompted a wave of visits this summer to @entity2 by several top @entity46 administration officials			1
gen. @entity47 , commander of @entity6 's @entity48 , warned sunday , " our answer to the @entity52 regime is quite clear			1
in the event of an attack on @entity6 by the @entity52 regime there will be nothing left of @entity2			1
" he added , " considering the size of @entity2 and its vulnerabilities and also because of the high number of our rockets , i do n't think anywhere in @entity2 will be safe			0
" @entity6 denies that it aims to build a nuclear bomb , saying that its nuclear program is for energy and medical use			0
@entity3 president @entity46 last week reportedly rejected @entity1 's call to lay down a line that @entity6 could not cross			1
according to the @entity72 , during an hour - long telephone call between the two leaders , @entity46 did not embrace @entity1 's proposal to set a limit on the size of @entity6 's stockpile of close - to - bomb - grade uranium and launch a military strike if @entity79 exceeded it			2
@entity1 has shown growing impatience with what he says is a lack of clarity by the @entity46 administration on articulating red lines over @entity6 's nuclear ambitions			0
the administration has resisted pressure to take that step			0
" we share a grave concern about @entity6 pursuing a nuclear weapon , " @entity3 ambassador to the @entity36 @entity90 told " @entity15 " sunday			1
" we are determined to prevent that from happening			0
president @entity46 has been absolutely clear , and on this there 's absolutely no daylight between the @entity3 and @entity2 that we will do what it takes to prevent @entity6 from acquiring a nuclear weapon			1
" steps the @entity3 and other countries are taking to pressure @entity6 are working , @entity101 said			1
" we have just seen the imposition of another layer of the toughest sanctions that have ever been imposed on a country , " she said , adding that @entity6 's oil production and currency have both plummeted 40 %			2
" and this is only going to intensify , so we think that there 's still considerable time for this pressure to work , but this is not an infinite window			2
" @entity3 intelligence officials have said they do not believe @entity6 has decided to develop a nuclear weapon , even as evidence continues to mount that the country is improving its ability to do so			2
far from establishing a threshold for military action , the closest @entity122 spokesman @entity121 would go last week was to repeat the commonly - used phrase " the president is committed to prevent @entity6 from acquiring a nuclear weapon			0
" atomic enrichment in and of itself is not a red line , a @entity3 official told @entity0 following the telephone call between @entity46 and @entity1			0
but @entity2 feels a sense of urgency , as negotiations aimed at curbing @entity6 's nuclear ambitions have failed to produce an agreement and sanctions have fallen short of their intended effect			1
the issue has taken on a decidedly political tone with @entity1 's call coming at the height of the presidential election season			0
the prime minister told @entity0 that he knew people " are trying to draw me into the @entity3 election , and i 'm not going to do that			1
" " but i will say that we value , we cherish the bipartisan support for @entity2 in the @entity3 , and we 're supported by @entity150 and @entity151 alike , " he said			2
" this is not an electoral issue			0
it is not based on any electoral consideration			0
i think that there 's a common interest of all @entity3 , of all political persuasions , to stop @entity6			1
this is a regime that is giving vent to the worst impulses that you see right now in the @entity163			0

new : if @entity2 attacks @entity6 , " there will be nothing left of @entity2 , " an @entity6 commander says
new : there 's still time for pressure to work on @entity6 , the @entity3 ambassador to the @entity36 says
@entity2 's leader says in six months , @entity6 will have 90 % of what it needs to produce a bomb
he says people are trying to draw him into the @entity3 election and he wo n't allow it
