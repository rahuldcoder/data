@entity0 , @entity1 -- the recent volcanic eruption in @entity4 is stranding hundreds of thousands of air travelers at @entity6 in the @entity7 and other airports across northern @entity9 , due to its voluminous clouds of volcanic ash that can clog airplane engines and limit visibility			1
however , this is by no means the first such volcanic eruption in @entity4 to affect human activities			1
long before the advent of air travel , the eruption of @entity4 's @entity17 in 1783 - 84 had profound effects on climate , not just in @entity4 but around the globe			1
volcanologists @entity23 and @entity25 estimated that a comparable event in the modern era would release enough ash and other eruptive materials into the atmosphere that the resulting ash cloud and sulfuric haze would probably disrupt air travel over much of the @entity33 for about five months			1
but there were impacts well afield of @entity4 and @entity9 at the time of @entity17			1
besides releasing clouds of ash into the atmosphere that can disrupt visibility and damage airplane engines , eruptions can cool the climate with the reflection of incoming solar radiation from the troposphere by volcanic sulfur - rich ash , which can decrease temperatures significantly for months or years in some cases			2
just such an aerosol effect is believed to have disrupted the @entity53 's thermal balance during the @entity17 event , cooling some @entity33 regions by as much as 1 or more degrees @entity56 below the long - term average			2
highly unusual conditions were described in the summer of 1783 after @entity17 , including poisonous volcanic fumes that killed perhaps 25 percent of the population of @entity4 , persistent haze and oppressive heat in @entity9 , and blood - red sunrises over @entity64 , @entity9 and other locations			1
the @entity17 eruption was believed to have caused thousands of deaths because of unusual conditions in @entity9 that summer , along with the severe cold of the following winter			2
@entity70 was one of the first to suggest that the extreme cold of 1783 - 84 over much of the @entity33 was connected to the @entity17 event			2
in @entity64 , @entity17 has been blamed for the starvation of @entity74 populations from severe cold in northwestern @entity76 , based on @entity74 oral history as well as tree - ring density data investigated by @entity79 and others , who estimated that conditions were about 4 degrees @entity56 colder than the mean			0
the density record of temperature - sensitive white spruce for this region showed extremely low values in the summer of 1783 , known in @entity74 lore as " the summer that did not come "			0
this observation was used to infer that this was the coldest summer in at least the past 400 years			0
such tree - ring records , along with other so - called proxy archives , can provide a wealth of information about volcanic events and their varying impacts around the globe because of resulting shifts in atmospheric circulation and other climate changes , dating for centuries prior to the period of instrumental record			0
the effects of major volcanic eruptions such as @entity17 can also be felt elsewhere on the globe , often far from their actual location			0
for example , significant cooling and strong dynamical effects after the @entity17 event and other high - latitude eruptions are believed to have caused decreased flow of the @entity114 in @entity115 and weakened @entity116 and @entity118 monsoons based on climate model simulations , with potentially very significant impacts on food and water supplies			0
tree - ring , coral and ice core records also indicate the effect of major volcanic events in the tropics of monsoon @entity118 for low - latitude eruptions such as that of @entity132 , @entity133 , in 1815 and other such events of the past several centuries , although this climate signal is also complicated by the @entity137			0
although the current eruption of @entity140 in @entity4 appears not to be comparable in intensity to those of @entity17 and @entity132 , it will have some effects , such as those on air travel , that were never realized back in those simpler times			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity150 .			0

ash from @entity4 volcano has grounded much of western @entity9 's air *traffic*
@entity150 says @entity4 volcano in 1783 had *drastic* effects
she says it killed many , *stunted* *agriculture* and led to starvation
a *similar* event today could *prevent* some air travel for five months , she says
