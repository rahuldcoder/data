-- fuel - saving gas - electric hybrid and all - electric cars and trucks powered by sizable battery packs and high voltage motors could present a new kind of danger at serious accident scenes , according to an industry group			1
a report by the @entity11 ( @entity11 ) highlighted risks to first responders and tow operators from potential electric shock from damaged systems not disengaged during or immediately after a crash			1
" as electric vehicles enter the marketplace in greater numbers , it 's an appropriate time to recognize best practices that facilitate a safe response when these vehicles are in an accident , " said @entity18 , chairman of the @entity11 technical committee that issued the report earlier this month			1
the group recommended automakers install switches that would kill battery power in the event of an accident			1
the location of those switches should be standardized for safety			0
another recommendation would create a guide for emergency workers , something @entity18 called a " cheat sheet for first responders			0
" it would quickly identify the location of high - voltage components allowing them to be disabled			0
tow truck drivers also need better information and training on how to handle hybrids and electric vehicles without receiving an unexpected jolt , the report said			1
more than 435,000 battery powered electric and hybrid electric vehicles were sold in the @entity55 this year , an increase of 53 % , compared to 2011 sales numbers , according to the @entity58			1
in may , auto industry officials and the @entity60 ( @entity60 ) and the @entity61 discussed potential dangers faced by first responders from electrical charges produced by hybrid and electric cars			1
@entity60 later issued interim guidance for consumers , emergency responders and tow truck operators to increase awareness about specific dangers			0
dangers can be reduced if responders have easy access to battery packs and if auto manufacturers create common disconnect locations in all hybrid and electric vehicles , @entity60 said			1
automakers are getting the message out to drivers and responders			0
@entity85 places the battery pack of its @entity88 all - electric car in a steel case			2
the @entity91 automaker also designed the battery pack to sense a crash and disable its electrical charge when involved in an accident			0
@entity96 has published a guide for first responders encountering its @entity99 involved in accidents			0
the @entity99 includes what @entity96 calls " @entity103 , " which are clearly marked logos on the doors and trunk lid to warn responders of possible electric shock			2
cables wrapped in orange high - voltage warning sleeves are located under the hood of the @entity112 @entity113 , maker of the @entity114 , is also helping to prepare fire service and other first responders			0
moreover , @entity113 took steps to better protect the volt battery pack following a fire that flared after a crash test in 2011			2
@entity60 found no defect with the lithium - ion battery system nor were any real world crash - fires ever reported			0
but the case highlighted potential safety concerns for first responders .			2

batteries of hybrid and electric cars could present safety risk in crashes , group says
clear labels recommended about battery and power systems to protect first responders
more than 435,000 electric , hybrid vehicles sold in the @entity55 this year , figures show
