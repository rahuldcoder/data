-- @entity3 prime minister @entity2 's intended presence as chief guest of honor at @entity7 's @entity6 in @entity8 on sunday symbolizes the significance @entity7 places on an ever - closer relationship with @entity3 in their mutual quest to counter the economic and strategic might of @entity15			1
@entity2 , whose defense minister , @entity16 , was in @entity7 earlier this month for talks on expanded bilateral defense cooperation , will see some of @entity7 's latest military hardware on display in the traditional parade , including its nuclear - capable long - range missiles , the @entity23 and @entity24			1
@entity7 successfully tested a 4,000 - km range @entity23 on january 20 from its @entity27 launch site in the @entity28			0
@entity6 is the most high - profile event on the @entity7 political calendar , and the government makes a point of inviting leaders from countries with whom it seeks to cultivate closer ties			0
chief guests in recent years have included the presidents of @entity40 and @entity41 , for example			0
last month , @entity7 and @entity3 held their first bilateral naval exercise in @entity7 waters off the coast of @entity46 , following on from a similar exercise in @entity3 waters in june 2012			1
the two sides have also taken part in the multilateral " @entity52 " naval exercises in recent years , joining @entity53 , @entity55 and @entity56 ships			0
territorial disputes @entity3 and @entity7 , the second and third - biggest economies in @entity61 behind @entity15 , both have an uneasy relationship with @entity63			1
tensions between @entity3 and @entity15 are running high over territorial disputes in the @entity66 centered on the @entity68 / @entity68 islands , and over the controversial december 26 visit by @entity2 to the @entity70 , the @entity71 site regarded by @entity15 , @entity72 and @entity41 as a symbol of @entity3 's imperial military past and honors war criminals			1
@entity7 and @entity15 fought a brief border war in 1962 and had a serious military standoff last april when @entity7 alleged that @entity15 troops crossed into @entity7 - held territory near @entity81 in the @entity83 mountain range			2
there were further incidents in july near @entity81 and in august in @entity87 , the northeastern @entity7 state where @entity15 also has laid claim to territory			2
since then , @entity7 prime minister @entity89 and @entity15 premier @entity90 have pledged " maximum restraint " on border issues			2
they vowed not to seek " unilateral superiority " along the 3,500 - km border when they signed an agreement in @entity63 last october			0
@entity3 -- and @entity2 in particularly -- has long regarded @entity7 as a powerful counterweight to @entity15 's strategic rise in the @entity100			1
in his 2007 book " towards a @entity101 : my vision for @entity3 , " @entity2 singled out @entity7 for special attention , writing that it would not surprise him if " in another decade , @entity3 - @entity7 relations overtake @entity3 - @entity53 and @entity3 - @entity15 ties			1
" @entity15 - @entity3 trade that goal looks improbable -- at least on the economic front			2
@entity3 's $ 340 billion of annual two - way trade with @entity15 dwarfs its $ 20 billion trade ties with @entity7 -- a consequence of the many @entity3 businesses based in @entity15 -- but @entity7 has long been the biggest recipient of @entity3 development aid and both sides are keen to grow business and investment ties			1
during @entity2 's upcoming visit , he and @entity89 are expected to discuss @entity3 investment and assistance for the @entity8 - @entity123 and other infrastructure projects such as the @entity125			0
@entity3 is also keen to sell its unique @entity127 seaplane to the @entity7 defense forces			2
asked at a press conference in @entity8 on january 6 about @entity15 concerns over the proposal , @entity3 defense minister @entity16 said he believed @entity15 was probably the world 's biggest exporter of weapons			1
" i feel there is an incongruity that @entity15 , which sells lots of weapons globally , is concerned about @entity3 's attempt to export the @entity53 - 2 , which is not even a weapon but just a seaplane			2
i speculate that the international community has the same view as ours , " he said			0
mistakes of past @entity2 , who became @entity3 prime minister in december 2012 -- a role he also held in 2006 - 07 -- has shown an assertive style in his attempts to rebuild @entity3 's economic and military status in the @entity100			0
his approach prompted sustained criticism from @entity15 during 2013 , urging @entity3 to " adopt a correct attitude " and reflect on the mistakes of its militaristic past			0
predictably , @entity2 's december 26 visit to @entity70 evoked strong reactions from both @entity15 and @entity41			0
@entity159 spokesperson @entity158 said on january 9 that @entity2 , by his actions and words , had " shut the door " on dialogue with the @entity15 side			0
" it shows that he does not have even the slightest interest in improving relations with @entity15 and other @entity61 neighbors , " @entity158 said			0
for @entity15 , a warmer relationship between @entity3 and @entity7 is just another indicator of what it regards as a @entity53 - led attempt to encircle or contain @entity15			1
in its view , the @entity179 administration 's " @entity61 pivot , " with its enhanced military cooperation with countries such as @entity3 , @entity55 and the @entity182 , is a vehicle to delay or derail @entity15 's natural ascension as the preeminent @entity61 power .			1

@entity7 and @entity3 have been in talks on expanded bilateral defense cooperation
both @entity61 powers have endured an uneasy relationship with @entity15
@entity3 has long regarded @entity7 as a powerful counterweight to @entity63 's strategic rise
yet trade between @entity15 and @entity3 dwarfs trade between @entity71 and @entity7
