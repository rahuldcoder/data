-- lie - detector tests could be used in a bid to stamp out corruption in cricket , an advisory committee of the sport 's rule - making body announced on wednesday			1
cricket was shrouded in controversy earlier this year when three members of the @entity12 team became the subject of match - fixing allegations during a tour of @entity16			1
following a police investigation , captain @entity19 and bowlers @entity20 and @entity22 -- who all protested their innocence -- will face a disciplinary hearing by the @entity26 in january			0
but after a meeting of the @entity29 in @entity30 on tuesday and wednesday , officials admitted that the latest corruption scandal has had a negative impact on the sport			1
blog : will @entity36 's one - day cricket reign end in 2011 ? " we are concerned at the scale of the problem , and the detrimental effect it has placed on the integrity of the game , " a statement on the @entity29 's official website read			1
" the committee feels more resources -- and increased powers -- are required to attempt to eradicate this issue from the game			0
the education of players should not be a meaningless formality ; the message should be pressed home with regularity by figures known and respected by the players			0
" as well as the possible introduction of lie - detector tests , other suggestions included the legalizing and regulating of betting markets in @entity63 , the inclusion of anti-corruption clauses in playing contracts and the non-inclusion of " tainted " players			1
the committee , comprised of past and present cricketers and officials , also said that captains should take more responsibility for their players			0
its recommendations will be considered by the @entity77 sub-committee in february			2
however , the proposal to use lie - detectors to determine whether or not players are competing for the right reasons has already been questioned			1
" i do n't know about the accuracy of lie - detector tests , " @entity16 captain @entity82 told the @entity84 @entity83 on wednesday on the eve of his side 's third @entity86 against @entity36 in @entity30			1
" but what i do know , and is probably more important , is that we do n't want the whiff of anything suspicious going on in the game			0
" @entity82 ' team also came under the spotlight when @entity98 chairman @entity97 made accusations -- which he later withdrew -- that some @entity16 players had themselves accepted money to fix match results			2
the ongoing scandal took a further turn when @entity106 wicketkeeper @entity105 fled to @entity84 during a series with @entity108 in @entity109 , claiming he had refused to fix a match			2
" we 've seen how disruptive and detrimental to the game of cricket it is			0
if we have to take extreme measures in order to be 100 % confident the game is being played in the right spirit , then i 'd certainly be happy to do that , " @entity82 said			0
" i 'd have to think about the arguments ( for lie - detector tests ) first			2
but the principle , of having 22 guys on the pitch that the supporters are absolutely 100 % certain are playing the game for the right reasons , is a good thing			0
