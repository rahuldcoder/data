@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity0 is one of the least accessible towns in @entity1 -- the place where the old @entity6 meets @entity7 -- which is probably why it gained a reputation as the place where outlaws went to hide			1
situated in the @entity12 , it is close to nothing : the cities of @entity15 and @entity16 are respectively nine hours south and eight hours north , and the nearest town -- @entity18 , official population three -- takes 3Â½ hours to reach , provided the dirt roads are n't closed due to rain			1
here , the earth is red , vegetation bare and temperatures extreme , but none of that stopped @entity27 from setting up camp a century ago when they found opal shimmering in the dirt			2
so they began digging , in more ways than one			0
as they mined the earth to discover one of the world 's richest gem deposits , they also discovered why westerners did n't settle in this barren , desolate region of @entity1 before : the heat			0
to battle temperatures that regularly reached above 110 , settlers dug underground dwellings , a practice that continues to this day			2
in the heat of day , people are nowhere to be found , each hidden in a mine or dugout			0
one sees why outlaws chose to come here : it 's far from anything , it 's desolate , it 's pockmarked with underground homes , and it offers the possibility of a fresh start and the hope of a fortune			1
walking down the town 's main drag today makes one feel like a real - life space cowboy and evokes an episode of " @entity67			1
" there 's a reconstructed " @entity75 " spaceship , underground hotels , a @entity72 beetle painted like an opal dangling from a store , signs for underground churches , a kangaroo orphanage , a couple of mining museums , underground home tours , and a pizza place that sells pies with toppings like kangaroo , emu sausage , sweet cranberry , asparagus , onions and @entity90			1
its residents are known for being eccentric and hearty -- and if some are outlaws , they do n't publicize it much on the street			2
what they do publicize is the town 's international community , which represents more than 50 countries			1
there are olive groves for the @entity102 and @entity103 , a @entity105 restaurant so @entity106 can taste home and grocery stores with fare ranging from sweet chili sauce to imported @entity103 fondant and a whole kangaroo tail , complete with fur			0
all in a town of 1,900			2
@entity0 remains a popular tourist destination for those seeking an authentic @entity12 experience ( or who want to see where films like " @entity120 , " " @entity121 " and " @entity122 " were filmed )			1
visitors often walk through the graveyard , where several tombstones are decorated with colored lights , and one even has , " have a drink on me , " etched into it , with beer and wine bottles resting nearby , free of charge			2
they board a four - wheel drive mail truck for a 13 - hour tour of @entity12 cattle stations and towns			2
and , of course , they sit on the hot , dusty earth , shooing away oddly persistent flies as they lose all sense of time searching for opal in the dirt , hoping that the next stone they turn might let them retire early			2
outlaws came to @entity0 a century ago to find their fortune			1
today , the town is an international community of residents united by their commitment to mining one of the world 's most precious gems			1
just as the town is home to the kind of diversity found in many cities , the opal that miners find so alluring , seductive , even , is a gem of many colors , with specks of pink , green , blue and red			1
