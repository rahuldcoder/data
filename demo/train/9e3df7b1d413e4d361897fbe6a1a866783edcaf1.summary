-- for centuries , @entity1 has existed in the @entity4 imagination as a byword for the most exotic , far - flung place conceivable			1
situated on the southern edge of the @entity9 , it acquired a near - mythical status in distant countries for its fabled inaccessibility , and for the accounts of the dazzling material and intellectual wealth to be found there			2
intrigued visitors continue to be drawn by the treasures that survive from the city 's medieval golden age as an important academic , religious and mercantile center -- its great earthen mosques , and hundreds of thousands of scholarly manuscripts held in public and private collections			1
the city , today part of present - day @entity27 and known as the " city of 333 saints " for the @entity31 imams , sheiks and scholars buried there , was made a @entity34 in 1988			1
but there are fears this carefully preserved legacy could be under threat from groups of armed rebels who have overrun the ancient city this month , in the vacuum left by retreating @entity27 government forces			1
@entity45 , the director general of @entity46 , has called on the groups to respect and protect the city 's heritage			1
" @entity1 's outstanding earthen architectural wonders that are the great mosques of @entity52 , @entity53 and @entity54 , must be safeguarded , " she said			1
" along with the site 's 16 cemeteries and mausolea , they are essential to the preservation of the identity of the people of @entity27 and of our universal heritage			1
" @entity1 , which has a population of about 50,000 , is held by at least two rival groups who have been involved in a northern uprising against @entity27 's government , headquartered in the southern capital of @entity70			1
one is @entity71 , a @entity72 group that seeks to impose @entity74 law			0
the other , the @entity75 ( @entity75 ) , has been fighting for an independent homeland for the nomadic @entity78 people in the country 's north , and earlier this month unilaterally proclaimed independence for the region they call @entity84			0

last month , a @entity78 uprising triggered a military coup against @entity27 's president @entity96 by officers dissatisfied with the government 's efforts to put down the insurrection			1
but in the disorder following the coup , the rebels seized large areas of the north			0
@entity106 , a researcher at the @entity107 in @entity108 , the @entity109 , said that while @entity1 was no longer a city of vital economic or military importance , it stood out as an important prize for the rebels due to its symbolic significance			1
" the group that controls @entity1 controls the symbolic capital of the entire region , because it 's that well - known across the world			2
if you control that city , it will be known			0
" historically , @entity1 's legend began to spread throughout the medieval world when the emperor of @entity27 made his pilgrimage to @entity127 through @entity128 in 1324 , and dazzled those he encountered with the gold his party carried			1
early in the 16th century , reports of the city on the sand -- then part of the @entity136 -- filtered back to @entity137 through the @entity139 diplomat and writer @entity140 , adding to the city 's near - mythical status as an @entity144 @entity143			2
becoming the first @entity137 to reach the city subsequently became an obsession for @entity4 explorers , many of whom perished in the desert sands			0
in 1824 , the @entity151 of @entity152 even offered a reward for the first @entity137 to accomplish the feat. two years later , however , the person to do so met with disaster			0
@entity159 explorer @entity157 survived an attack by @entity78 nomads en route to @entity1 , only to discover on arrival that its wealth had greatly diminished since its heyday			2
@entity157 stayed a month in the city , then was murdered two days after leaving			0
during its golden age , @entity1 was a thriving desert trading town at the heart of important trade routes for gold and salt , and a major intellectual and spiritual center , which played a key role in the spread of @entity177 in @entity144			1
@entity177 scholars traveled great distances to study in the city 's university , which had 25,000 students during its zenith , and was comprised of three mosques			2

the latter , @entity1 's oldest , was built in the early 14th century , while the @entity53 , during its heyday , was said to have the largest collection of books in @entity144 since the @entity199 of antiquity			0
" @entity1 in the 14th to the 16th century was an important university city where many manuscripts referring to knowledge of astronomy , economy , religion , mathematics , physics , and medicine were produced , " said @entity201 , chief of the @entity144 unit for @entity46 's @entity203			1
comprising the other significant component of @entity1 's heritage legacy , this immense trove of scholarly manuscripts -- estimated to number in the hundreds of thousands -- remains in the city in state and private collections			1
for generations , local families have protected the fragile manuscripts , some of which date from the 13th century , from invaders			0
fearing that those responsible for the current unrest could loot or destroy the treasures , librarians and curators are making efforts to hide the texts or smuggle them out of the city to safety			0
while there have been reports that offices of local libraries have been looted by the gunmen , no significant losses of the documents have yet been reported , according to @entity201			0
" we are still concerned by what could happen there in case there is a fight -- we 're concerned about the risk of damage , " said @entity201			0
" we also do n't know what the reaction of the @entity72 groups will be with regard to the manuscripts			2
" he said the city 's heritage was vastly important to locals -- as a source of cultural pride , but also of income			0
even if the city 's treasures survived unscathed , they stood to lose out from the uprising as it could plunge the region into isolation once again			0
in addition , an estimated 200,000 people have been displaced by the uprising in the wider region			0
" the fact this part of the country has been taken by the @entity78 rebellion and @entity72 groups does not allow any more tourists to visit , and the communities depend a lot on the tourism revenue , " he said			2
" this is really going to affect their lives			0
