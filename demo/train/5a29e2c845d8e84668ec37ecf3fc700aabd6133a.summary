only in space would 2 million miles be considered a close call			1
an asteroid with an estimated diameter of three football fields zoomed by @entity5 late monday , missing our home by about that distance			1
it traveled at some 27,000 miles per hour			2
the asteroid came just about a year after a relatively small asteroid blew up over @entity12			1
the roughly 60 - foot space rock plunged into @entity5 's atmosphere and exploded over the city of @entity16 with the force of about 30 early nuclear bombs			1
the blast left more than 1,500 injured , mostly by glass from shattered windows , and raised concerns about humanity 's vulnerability to stray asteroids			0
" on a practical level , a previously unknown , undiscovered asteroid seems to hit our planet and cause damage or injury once a century or so , as we witnessed on june 20 , 1908 , and february 15 , 2013 , " said @entity32 , @entity33 host and astronomer			0
@entity33 tracks potentially hazardous objects , like asteroids and comets			0
@entity38 added : " every few centuries , an even more massive asteroid strikes us -- fortunately usually impacting in an ocean or wasteland such as @entity43			0
" but the ongoing threat , and the fact that biosphere - altering events remain a real if small annual possibility , suggests that discovering and tracking all @entity50 ( near - @entity5 objects ) , as well as setting up contingency plans for deflecting them on short notice should the need arise , would be a wise use of resources			2
