@entity0 -- the @entity2 will take up a draft resolution that would establish an interim peacekeeping force for the disputed border region of @entity6 , @entity8 ambassador to the @entity0 @entity9 told reporters thursday			1
the draft resolution calls for the deployment of 4,200 @entity14 peacekeepers to the region			1
" we are looking forward to discussions with council members in order to swiftly adopt a resolution authorizing this new interim security force for @entity6 so that the agreement that both parties have reached , which is obviously urgent and fragile , can be implemented immediately and effectively , " @entity16 told reporters after the @entity2 met in closed session			1
the purpose of the interim security agreement is to allow for the withdrawal of forces from @entity6 , she said			1
" at this stage that means the forces of the government of @entity34 , which are now occupying @entity6 , and that that area would become demilitarized and administered in a joint fashion and that would persist pending resolution of the critical underlying issues			1
" time for action over @entity34 ? the @entity41 government and the @entity42 signed an agreement monday that allows @entity0 peacekeepers in @entity6			1
the two sides agreed in principle on the need for a third party to monitor the ill - defined border between north and south before the scheduled july 9 independence for the south			0
thursday 's announcement came a day after @entity8 president @entity53 applauded the signing of the agreement , the latest effort to quell the violence in @entity34 that has forced tens of thousands of people from their homes			2
" i commend the parties for taking this step forward toward peace , and i urge them now to build on that progress and agree to an immediate cease - fire in @entity67 , " the @entity60 said in a statement			0
@entity67 is the oil - rich northern border state where fighting has also erupted between government troops and forces loyal to the south			0
@entity16 said she was concerned about the humanitarian situation in @entity67			0
" we are deeply concerned about attacks on and threats to and intimidation of @entity0 personnel , obstructions to freedom of movement and access for humanitarian goods , allegations and indeed verified reports of aerial bombardment and other attacks against civilian personnel , " she said			0
" with a cease - fire in @entity67 , alongside the agreement to deploy peacekeepers to @entity6 , we can get the peace process back on track , " she said			1
" but without these actions , the road map for better relations with the government of @entity34 can not be carried forward , which will only deepen @entity34 's isolation in the international community			2
" the people from the @entity102 in @entity67 are northerners but they aligned with the south 's rebel movement during @entity34 's decades - long civil war			2
they are viewed as a threat by @entity108 because @entity67 will remain part of the north after independence			0
" the treatment of civilians in @entity67 , including the reported human rights abuses and targeting of people along ethnic lines , is reprehensible , " said @entity112 , the @entity0 undersecretary general for @entity113 and @entity114			0
between @entity6 and @entity67 , about 160,000 people have been displaced from their homes , the @entity0 has said			2
@entity34 voted for independence in a january referendum that was largely peaceful			0
but with its separation pending , tensions have heightened to what they were like during the civil war days and there has been little cause for celebration over the birth of a nation			0
the @entity134 issued a warning wednesday , urging @entity8 citizens to avoid travel to the border areas -- including @entity6 and @entity67 -- as well as to the @entity140 region of @entity34 .			1
