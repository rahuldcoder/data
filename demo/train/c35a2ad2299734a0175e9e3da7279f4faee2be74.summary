@entity0 -- @entity2 rolls up the sleeves of her t - shirt , juggles a stack of fliers and knocks on the door of a stranger 's home			1
she 's on a mission to save lives			2
after wiping sweat from her face beneath the sweltering afternoon sun on a recent thursday , she ascends another set of stairs leading to a front door and knocks			2
no one answers , but she 's greeted warmly by neighbors sitting in the shade of the covered connecting porch			2
" we 're here doing free @entity26 testing , " she tells them , handing over a flier			1
" we decided to come here because 19143 has one of the highest rates of @entity26 in the entire city			1
" that 's the zip code for southwest @entity0 , one of many urban neighborhoods across the @entity32 that account for the bulk of the nation 's @entity26 cases			1
@entity2 , a second - year medical student , is one of 60 outreach volunteers who spent their summer going door - to - door alongside health care workers testing residents within the 19143 zip code			1
this part of @entity0 -- like many other urban neighborhoods in the @entity32 -- has an hiv infection rate on par with many @entity46 nations , including @entity47 and @entity48 , according to @entity49			1
in fact , more @entity32 are living with hiv infections today than ever before partly because of an increase in testing and treatment options , according to the @entity55			1
about 1.2 million @entity32 are @entity26 positive , with a rate of 50,000 new cases each year , according to the @entity55			1
yet , 20 % of those infected are unaware they are @entity26 positive			1
@entity60 survivor : epidemic is n't over yet in @entity0 , more than 19,000 residents have @entity26 , with the highest rates among black residents living in low - income neighborhoods with limited access to health care facilities and services			1
" about 40 to 50 neighborhoods account for about half of the @entity32 ' infections , " said @entity69 , founder of @entity0 's @entity70 , @entity71			1
" in @entity0 , a few neighborhoods have very high rates of infection , and those few neighborhoods are driving the overwhelming share of infections			1
" to change that , @entity69 and her team enlisted volunteers to go to those neighborhoods , knock on doors , get people tested and , if @entity26 positive , get them free treatment			1
while many volunteers get a " no thank you , " they have tested more than 160 people since the program started in july			1
so far , no one has tested positive for @entity26			1
the door to door campaign is not the first @entity26 outreach in @entity0 , but it is arguably the most ambitious			1
the do one thing program aims to diagnose as many people as possible , as well as create a prevention model that can be replicated in other @entity32 cities			1
the program also gets its message out through social media , billboards , community and church leaders , as well as local health centers			1
part of the problem is combating a lack of awareness about who is at risk for getting @entity26			1
" a lot of people , even in 2012 , think this is a gay disease , " @entity69 said			0
" but that 's not the case , especially in @entity0			1
" opinion : end the @entity26 stigma @entity0 resident @entity120 was shocked to learn that his neighborhood has one of the highest hiv / aids rates in the city			1
he agreed to get tested for the virus for free on the spot			2
inside the mobile medical rv -- complete with two examination rooms and waiting area -- health worker @entity130 swabbed @entity120 's cheeks and gums as part of the routine , rapid hiv test			2
" this is a preventable disease , " @entity130 said			0
" blacks carry the burden of genetic diseases from high blood pressure to diabetes			0
@entity26 is the one thing you do n't inherit			2
it 's the one thing we can prevent			2
" compared with other races and ethnicities , @entity46 - @entity32 make up a larger proportion of @entity26 infections at all stages of the disease , according to the @entity55			1
in 2009 , 44 % of all new hiv infections were african - americans -- most of them men , the @entity55 found			0
about 20 minutes after his test , @entity120 gets the results			0
" it says i 'm not positive , " said @entity120 holding up his hiv / aids results card			0
" it 's better to know than not to know			0
it made my heart sink to hear about the rates in southwest @entity160			0
" @entity69 said she is confident that her grassroots effort will not only spread awareness about @entity26 but also provide more access to treatment			2
" we 're taking all of our tools and putting them in one of the hottest zones in the city to see ... if we can really make a difference in eradicating racial disparities in hiv infection , " @entity69 said			0
" one of the biggest problems is that a lot of people do n't think that they 're at risk for @entity26 , and so what we 're trying to do is get as many people tested as possible so we can link people who test positive to treatment services			2
" her grassroots outreach is a key component of the @entity32 ' first @entity60 national strategy , launched in 2010 , which emphasizes providing support in the communities most affected by the disease			2
this summer , as @entity69 's volunteers hit the streets , the @entity32 hosted its first @entity191 in @entity192 , something that was only possible because of the removal of a travel ban preventing hiv - positive people from entering the country			1
treating @entity26 has come a long way since it was first discovered in the early 1980s			2
the virus , which can lead to @entity60 , is most often treated with a cocktail of anti-viral drugs that not only reduces the likelihood of @entity60 infection but also decreases the chances of transmitting the virus			0
@entity207 panel recommends drug to prevent @entity26 after seeing statistics for hiv infection rates blot out specific neighborhoods in @entity0 , @entity69 decided she wanted to try something different			1
so she turned to testing models in @entity214 that reached people at their homes and in their neighborhoods , reaching people who otherwise might not have been tested			2
this model helped get people who tested positive into treatment much earlier in the course of their infection -- helping to stop the spread of the virus			0
just because the @entity26 rates are higher in certain parts of the city does n't mean the issue does n't impact the broader community , said @entity2			1
" it 's not just this zip code and this census track , " she said			0
" the fact that i can jump on a trolley and get here means that i 'm close enough to have to worry about it			0
" back in @entity239 , @entity238 spotted the rv parked in his neighborhood offering free hiv tests and wandered in on his way home			1
@entity120 , a 25 - year - old father of two , lost his mother to @entity60 a decade ago			0
while she was n't infected during her pregnancy , the disease hits close to home for @entity120			0
he said he tries to get tested whenever he can			0
while waiting for the results , @entity120 answered a series of questions from rapid test volunteer @entity251			0
" i did n't tell people about my mom , i did n't say what she had , " @entity120 said			0
" she was dying slow and then went to hospice			0
i was there when she died			0
" " are you ready , " @entity251 asked			0
" yes , " he said matter - of - factly			0
" you are negative for @entity26 , " she said			2
it 's the answer he expected			0
with his results card and a few fliers for neighbors , @entity120 headed home			0
" i was really touched by him , " said @entity251 watching him walk out of view			0
" he knew she did n't have to die , but it did n't break him and he 's not bitter			0
" 30 years of @entity60 moments to remember			0

@entity26 is prevalent in many low - income neighborhoods in @entity32 cities
these urban centers have @entity26 rates on par with @entity46 nations
in @entity0 , volunteers started going door to door offering free testing
the program 's founder hopes it will be a model for other cities
