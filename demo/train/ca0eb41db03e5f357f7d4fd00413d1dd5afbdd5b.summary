-- on sunday , @entity1 premieres " @entity7 , " its @entity3 and @entity4 biopic starring @entity5 and @entity6			1
exec producer @entity8 openly admits @entity5 brought with her a younger demographic ( and headlines ) but also risk			1
he first met with @entity5 about the project last december but cameras did n't roll until june			1
" when we first met with her , she had two probations , and when we finally closed the deal with her , there was only one probation , " @entity8 says			1
" if we could n't have gotten insurance , there would have been no movie			1
we wound up having to go to @entity22 to get what we called incarceration insurance ...			1
we had to protect ourselves that if she were to have violated her probation during production , we would n't have had to close down and lose our movie			1
" @entity0 : how did you approach @entity6 after having cast @entity5 ? @entity8 : it was n't until i had @entity6 that i slept			1
it was n't until i saw @entity6 and @entity5 meet in that room and i saw the chemistry that i knew i could make @entity3 and @entity4 live again			1
@entity0 : was it difficult to cast someone opposite @entity5 knowing he might have concerns ? @entity38 : what will you do on @entity41 ? @entity8 : it was			1
i looked at every actor from @entity45 there was			2
i looked at every actor from the @entity48 there was			2
and i wound up hiring a guy from @entity51 to play the most famous @entity45 actor of all time			2
so it 's the magic of @entity55			2
i think @entity6 is just fantastic in the movie			2
@entity0 : you were on the set every day			2
is there a moment in the movie when you think @entity5 most related to @entity3 ? @entity8 : it was in the ethereal soundstage in black that she most related to @entity3			1
it was when they 're speaking to camera and breaking the fourth wall			2
@entity3 and @entity4 were the first @entity70 , the most famous hunted couple in the world , the first paparazzi couple that 's given birth to the celebrity - crazed world that we now live in			1
that 's what fame 's about			2
fame is the accumulation of all the good , bad , true , untrue , flattering , and non-flattering things said and written about someone when you become iconic			2
we respect @entity3 and @entity4 so much that we wanted to give them the last word , meaning that fourth - wall interview of them speaking to camera [ throughout the film ] is the two of them speaking from the grave			2
we decided to dress them in the ultimate thespian outfit			2
they 're sitting in a director 's chair , in all black			0
it 's almost like @entity55 heaven			0
and what they 're saying is , " listen , we were this , we were that			0
the paparazzi said this , the paparazzi said that			0
all these things written about us â € ” let us tell you what they said about us , what was really going on , and how we really felt about each other			0
" that device , which was my homage to @entity3 and @entity4 , has allowed them the last word on themselves as icons and on what the media and the celebrity - crazed world can do with a couple			0
maybe if we had n't had all this attention paid to us , we could have kept it together , but there were too many balls we were trying to keep in the air			0
that 's what @entity3 's saying			0
that 's what makes it tragic			0
@entity3 ' love nest ' trailer trashed during filming @entity0 : is there a scene in the movie that you 're sure people will assume is totally made up that you want to assure them is n't ? @entity8 : i believe that the scene in which @entity144 comes home to that party , and @entity4 in front of everybody forces her to confess her love for him in front of @entity144 , seems so outrageous , but it is so absolutely true , having been reported many , many times over the years as happening just like that			1
as is every scene in the movie , by the way			0
the fact that they were denounced by the @entity160 , that 's pretty strong			0
it 's one thing to get a @entity162 , it 's another thing for the @entity160 to denounce you ... i know that when i was a kid , i used to go to the movies and when i would watch a true story about someone who was famous , i believed that to be the movie			0
people who make movies have to understand the responsibility you have when you make a biopic			1
you have to be accurate			0
it takes a lot of effort and painstaking details to make these movies right , down to the wigs that take place over four decades , even after they 're dead			0
[ @entity182 ] that 's hard			0
@entity0 : now that you have worked with @entity5 , are you hoping other producers give her a chance ? @entity8 : i want the best for @entity5 and anybody who ever hires her			1
but they have to know that making a movie with @entity5 is like jumping out of an airplane at 10,000 feet with a bolt of white nylon , a string , and a sewing machine			1
you 're building a parachute as fast as you can			0
@entity5 : keep me on set , it 's safer that way @entity0 : your next planned biopic is on @entity200			1
@entity8 : i 've optioned @entity202 's book [ @entity203 ]			1
we have a fantastic take on her life , and we 're talking to networks now , as we speak , and we 're interviewing writers right now , too			0
i am from @entity209 , as is @entity200 , and i believe that her start on a rural country road in @entity209 to the world stage that she lives is a journey that is nothing less than miraculous			1
i think it will be the most fascinating biopic i 've ever done			1
i 've made the @entity217 and @entity218 movie [ @entity219 ]			0
i 've made the @entity221 movie [ and the @entity222 ]			0
i 've made the @entity223 and @entity225 movie [ @entity226 ]			0
and now i 've done @entity3 and @entity4			0
i think the only thing i could follow all those up with would be @entity200			1
