president @entity22 has directed the @entity1 intelligence community to urgently gather additional information to try to assess whether chemical weapons were used wednesday , @entity21 spokeswoman @entity20 said thursday			1
at this time , she said , the @entity1 is unable to " conclusively determine " chemical weapons use , but is focused on trying to nail down the facts , along with its international partners			1
@entity20 said , as she has before , that if reports of chemical weapons use prove true , the president has a range of options available to him to respond			1
later , a senior defense official told @entity34 that " the military continues to refine options for @entity5 to be prepared for whatever the president might request down the line			1
" @entity20 noted that secretary of state @entity39 spoke by phone thursday to @entity5 opposition leader @entity41 ; @entity0 secretary - general @entity42 ; and @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity46 and @entity47 leaders			1

" @entity42 urged a @entity14 - based team " to be granted permission and access to swiftly investigate the incident " and the @entity0 is sending a formal request to @entity5			1
" he expects to receive a positive response without delay , " his spokesperson said in a statement			0
@entity0 @entity61 @entity60 said the matter is " of utmost urgency " and the " allegations are exceptionally grave			2
" @entity60 urged both the government and opposition to enable investigators " to examine the site of the alleged attacks without any delay or obfuscation			2
" " the use of chemical weapons is prohibited under customary international law , " she said , noting that the prohibition is binding on the government and rebels			1
" whether or not chemical weapons were in fact used , it seems that once again in @entity5 many civilians have been killed in flagrant contravention of international law			1
" @entity0 special advisers @entity84 and @entity85 similarly urged immediate access for the @entity0 investigation			2
" there is never any military justification for the use of chemical weapons -- whether by governments or anti-government armed groups -- given their horrific and indiscriminate impact , " they said in a joint statement			1
international outrage suffering in @entity5 is clear , but cause and culprits are murky the reports prompted international outrage , with a @entity100 briefing called late wednesday to discuss the situation			2
however , @entity102 and @entity103 -- consistent allies of the @entity5 government -- reportedly blocked a formal resolution			1
hours after the closed - door meeting , @entity43 foreign minister @entity107 told @entity34 affiliate @entity109 that " a reaction of force must be taken " if the allegations are true			0
" if the @entity100 can not do it , decisions will be made otherwise , " @entity107 said			0
but , he said , sending ground troops to @entity5 is out of question			0
chemical weapons frightful , relatively inexpensive @entity107 also added his voice to calls for a @entity0 team currently in @entity5 to investigate previous claims of chemical weapons use by either side to be given access to the site of the alleged massacre outside @entity14			1
if @entity7 's regime " has nothing to reproach itself with , " it should let the @entity0 weapons inspectors investigate the alleged attack , @entity107 said			2
" if the @entity5 refuse , that means they have been caught red - handed , " he said			0
@entity46 urges decisive action speaking on a visit to @entity138 , @entity46 foreign minister @entity136 called on the @entity0 to act decisively , @entity46 's semi-official @entity135 news agency reported			2
@entity136 said " all red lines " have been crossed without the @entity0 taking action in @entity5 and that the body " ca n't assume an undecisive attitude about chemical weapon attacks " there			1
" if the @entity5 regime is confident enough , it should allow the @entity0 team to investigate ( the chemical attack claims ) immediately , " he added			1
speaking alongside him , @entity148 foreign minister @entity147 said the reports from @entity5 " are serious and , should they be confirmed , outrageous			1
" he demanded a prompt explanation of the reported chemical weapons use , and also called for the @entity0 chemical weapons team to be allowed access			1
" i regret that @entity102 and @entity103 have blocked a formal resolution of the @entity100 , " @entity147 said			1
@entity157 's government denied the claims on state - run media wednesday , calling them " completely baseless			1
" " everything that has been said is absurd , primitive , illogical and fabricated , " said @entity5 information minister @entity160 on state tv			2

" @entity5 strikes refugee camp in northern @entity184 he accused the international community of " paying lip service " when it comes to @entity5			0

" i think that the investigation of the @entity0 is a joke			0
" the @entity196 said wednesday that officials were " working urgently to gather additional information			0
" it called for the @entity0 team in @entity5 to be given immediate access to witnesses and affected individuals , and to be allowed to collect evidence unhindered by the government			1
" if the @entity5 government has nothing to hide and is truly committed to an impartial and credible investigation of chemical weapons use in @entity5 , it will facilitate the @entity0 team 's immediate and unfettered access to this site , " the statement said			1
but @entity1 senator and former presidential candidate @entity215 was strongly critical of the administration 's handling of the situation in an interview with @entity34 's " @entity220 " on thursday			0
he said chemical weapons use was " obvious from the pictures when you see the dead bodies of children and women and others stacked up			2
" @entity215 said he was " sure and confident " that @entity7 had used chemical weaponry before , and that @entity22 's failure to act on what the @entity1 president had said would be a " red line " had given the @entity5 leader a green light to use these weapons again			1
@entity215 called for the @entity1 to take military action from outside @entity5 's borders to prevent that happening , saying it could " very easily " do what 's needed to take out @entity5 runways and aircraft and establish a no - fly zone			1
