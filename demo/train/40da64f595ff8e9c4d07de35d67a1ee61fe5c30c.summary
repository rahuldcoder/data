the @entity0 find themselves under fire for their name , which many @entity3 and others find to be a racial slur			2
previously the target of protests and opprobrium , the @entity0 have now lost their federal trademark registration for the name , as it was deemed too disparaging to remain protected			1
there are two issue to consider here : one is technical and the other is one we should all find troubling			2
the first : this case was about a trademark , and the primary purpose of trademark law is to protect the public so that the public can accurately know the source or origin of goods and services			2
but headlines that say the @entity0 lost their trademark are inaccurate			1
all they lost was their trademark registration , not the right to use the racist term to identify their team -- and that is a key point			1
in the @entity39 , trademark rights flow from an organization using the trademark ; technically , you do n't need to register a trademark in order to have trademark rights			1
( in other countries , you need a registration )			0
with its common law rights intact , the team is free to continue to call itself the " @entity0			1
" moreover , it can still sue you for selling counterfeit @entity0 gear , and it can still block someone from starting a @entity0 dodgeball team			1
the @entity0 still have trademark rights , and strong rights at that			1
if the team owners still have rights in the trademark , why is losing the registration a big deal ? what does a registration give you ? it gives you a few statutory presumptions in the event that you go to court over enforcement of your trademark			1
it gives a presumption of ownership and validity			0
in simple terms , the cancellation only means that if there is a trademark infringement lawsuit , the @entity0 team is going to have to pay a bit more in attorneys ' fees to win its case			1
opinion : is end near for @entity0 ? it 's about time but nobody can seriously argue that @entity91 's football team is not the owner of the still - intact trademark rights , nor that the public associates his team with the racist name			1
the second issue : there is something even more offensive than the team 's name : the fact that this case happened at all			2
the decision , i believe , has @entity107 implications that we should n't ignore			2
i do not care whether you like or dislike the @entity0 ' name			2
i think it 's a pretty dumb thing to call a football team			0
if @entity3 believe that " redskin " is offensive to them , then it is			0
most people agree that it is about as offensive as using any other ethnic slur			0
i respect their position and their argument			0
@entity120 gets rid of ' @entity0 , ' joins rising tide against name nevertheless , here are my criticisms of this decision : section ( 2 ) ( a ) of the @entity127 bars the registration of any trademark that is " immoral " " scandalous " or " disparaging			1
" in other words , a civil servant executing the registration is allowed to be the arbiter of morality			2
do we really want that ? trademarks propose a commercial transaction			0
when you see or hear a trademark , you immediately receive information in a short - hand way that communicates where the products come from , or what level of service you can expect			0
trademarks are @entity107 protected expression			1
there should be no issue with limiting their use to mislead the public			0
after all , what point do they serve if they do not propose a truthful association with their owner ? and what rational governmental purpose does it serve to deny a benefit to a business because it might be deemed " immoral " by someone ? and why are we even arguing the point ? the government should not be in the business of deciding what is moral , immoral , or offensive			0
this section of the trademark act is a leftover from @entity173 times , and is used now primarily to promote social agendas with coercive censorship			1
to justify such censorship , the government must demonstrate that the harms it seeks to address are real and that its restriction will in fact alleviate them to a material degree			0
in addition , the courts have found , such a restriction " may not be sustained if it provides only ineffective or remote support for the government 's purpose			0
" these mandates are " critical , " for otherwise " [ the government ] could with ease restrict commercial speech in the service of other objectives that could not themselves justify a burden on commercial expression			0
" in this case , what is the governmental purpose in depriving the @entity0 of their trademark registration ? is it that the government is serving as a morality teacher ? is it choosing a favored position , and then enforcing it by only giving government benefits to companies that agree with that orthodoxy ? do you trust any government to tell you what your morality should be ? if so , do you trust this government to do that ? remember , even if you 're one of the well - intentioned many who think that the name is disgusting , do you want to surrender your first amendment rights to the next group who might find your morality to be outside the norm ? i do not			1
while i think that @entity91 should change the name of his football team , i think that the government should remain neutral in the matter .			0

@entity228 : redskins lost trademark registration for name . news leaves 2 issue to consider
but @entity0 still have trademark rights , can sue infringers , keep using racist term to identify team
case raises @entity107 issues ; why is trademark office arbiter of morality ? he asks
@entity228 : trademarks are protected expression . coercive censorship at play here
