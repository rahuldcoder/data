@entity1 will face his accusers at the @entity43 for the former @entity6 in @entity44 , @entity36			1

" victims have waited nearly two decades to see @entity1 in the dock , " said @entity49 , senior counsel in the @entity50 at @entity51			2
" his trial should lay to rest the notion that those accused of atrocity crimes can run out the clock on justice			2
" 2001 : @entity1 captured @entity1 's trial begins after a landmark war crimes ruling last month , when another international tribunal found former @entity62 president @entity61 guilty of aiding and abetting war crimes in neighboring @entity65 's notoriously brutal civil war			1
" both trials are evidence of the growing international trend to hold perpetrators of atrocities to account , no matter how senior their position , " @entity51 said			0

though he was carrying two handguns , he surrendered without a fight			0
he was extradited for trial in the @entity36			0
but from day one in custody , he has exhibited defiance and appears not to have relinquished his visceral antagonism toward his enemies			0
he drew a finger across his throat in court , a gesture aimed at some of the @entity17 widows			2
at other times , he disrupted proceedings by putting on a hat in the courtroom and refusing to enter a plea			0
he has sought delays in his trial and said he is in failing health			2
but come wednesday , @entity1 's long - awaited trial is set to start			1
in july 1995 , @entity1 was in command of the @entity107 and led his soldiers into the town of @entity17			1
in the days that followed , the soldiers systematically slaughtered nearly 8,000 @entity14 men and boys			1

" @entity16 peace negotiator @entity115 once described @entity1 as " one of those lethal combinations that history thrusts up occasionally -- a charismatic murderer			2
" in the three decades leading up to the violent splintering of @entity6 , @entity1 rose rapidly through the ranks of the @entity6 army			0
in 1991 , he served as a front - line commander spearheading @entity78 forces in a yearlong war with @entity125			0
by the time he took to @entity16 's battlefields , he had become a hero to many @entity39 , seen as a defender of their dwindling fortunes			0
in may 1992 , @entity16 's @entity78 political leaders picked him to lead the assault on their @entity14 enemies who clamored for independence			1
@entity1 wasted no time galvanizing his heavily armed forces in a siege of @entity137 , cutting the city off from the outside world			0
@entity78 forces pounded the city every day from higher ground positions , trapping @entity137 's ill - prepared citizens in the valley below			0
more than 10,000 people , mostly civilians , perished			0
some observers conjured images of @entity137 in describing @entity147 attacks on the besieged city of @entity149 earlier this year			0
as the war ended in the fall of 1995 , @entity1 went on the run			1
shortly after @entity1 was sent to @entity44 last year , authorities nabbed former @entity155 rebel leader @entity154			0
