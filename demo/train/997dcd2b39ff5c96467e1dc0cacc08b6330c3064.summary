-- a new video of last year 's @entity3 plane crash in @entity4 shows firefighters spotting a 16 - year - old @entity7 girl lying on the ground , but failing to help her , an attorney for the girl 's family charges			1
@entity12 was later run over by two different fire trucks , killing her , said @entity15 , a lawyer for the girl 's family			1
the newly released video challenges an account by fire officials that the @entity7 teenager was accidentally run over because she may have been covered in firefighting foam , @entity15 asserts			1
in fact , the video depicts one firefighter alerting a truck driver about how " there 's a body right there			2
" in the footage , a firefighter stops an emergency vehicle racing toward the scene			0
" @entity34 , whoa , whoa ! stop , stop , stop ! there 's a body ... there 's a body right there			2
right in front of you , " the firefighter told the driver			0
the video was captured on a camera attached to a firefighter 's helmet and first aired by @entity48			2
another video from a fire truck shows a firefighter on the ground directing the truck around a victim , who was not covered in foam at the time			1
@entity12 's parents have filed a gross negligence claim against the city and county of @entity4 , arguing that the emergency responders who spotted @entity12 on the ground failed to save her life			1
no charges for firefighter who ran over @entity3 crash survivor @entity12 was on the plane traveling from her @entity7 home to an @entity69 summer camp and was her parents ' only child , under @entity7 's one - child policy , @entity15 said			1
" it 's unthinkable , it 's unimaginable , because the first thing that -- the first priority of the firefighters or any rescue personnel is saving lives , " @entity15 said of the video			1
" and the first step in triage is to take the pulse , check the respiration			0
" and the video , which i think is the best evidence of what happened , shows at least five firefighters who saw her , who understood she was there , and none of them did the basic step of checking if she was alive , " @entity15 told @entity0 's " @entity97 360			1
" the tire of first fire vehicle ran over the girl 's head , and then a second fire vehicle , which was n't equipped with a spotter to help maneuver it , ran over her body , @entity15 said			2
a @entity107 coroner ruled that @entity12 was alive when flung from the plane but died of " multiple blunt injuries that are consistent with being run over by a motor vehicle			2
" " those injuries she received , she was alive at the time , " @entity112 coroner @entity111 said			0
@entity0 legal analyst @entity114 expressed caution , however , in interpreting the video			0
" to create this image of the firefighters as incompetent villains here based on a tape that 's been edited , as i understand it , by the plaintiff 's lawyers here , i mean , i think it 's important to reserve judgment , " @entity114 said , while acknowledging " the horrible pain " the girl 's family is now enduring			1
" this is a complicated situation where the chronology is very important			0
and you know , we 're not talking about a traffic accident where there is one body on the floor -- and , of course , firefighters should check that			0
we 're looking at a situation where firefighters are potentially looking at hundreds of casualties and are trying to deal with that , " @entity114 said			0
two other people died when @entity145 crash - landed july 6 at the @entity146			0
