-- @entity1 have confirmed that striker @entity2 will be out of action for " approximately six weeks " after suffering ankle ligament damage during the @entity6 ' international friendly against @entity7 on saturday			1
initially it had been feared the @entity10 forward -- who has scored eight goals in 15 games in all competitions this season and emerged as one of the @entity17 ' key figures -- could be set for a much - longer spell on the sidelines			2
@entity25 , 26 , will return to @entity26 later this week to continue his rehabilitation but is set to miss key clashes with @entity31 leaders @entity29 at the end of the month , the trip to @entity21 on december 13 as well as the rest of the hectic @entity24 schedule			0
an official @entity1 club statement read : " following the care given to @entity2 by the @entity10 @entity35 , he will travel back to @entity26 this week and continue his treatment with the @entity1 medical team			1
" @entity25 will be out of action for approximately six weeks			0
" although @entity2 could be back for what is likely to be a season - defining few weeks when @entity1 host @entity40 on january 31 before games against @entity29 and then @entity21 , the loss of the player could not have come at a worse time for @entity1 manager @entity45			1
@entity47 striker @entity46 ( groin ) and @entity49 forward @entity50 ( knee ) are already out until early december , so @entity53 international @entity52 is likely to take @entity2 's place in the @entity17 side			1
@entity25 suffered the injury to his right leg in the 10th minute of saturday 's goalless draw against @entity7 in @entity59			2
he was carried off on a stretcher following a heavy challenge from @entity7 defender @entity62 and tests showed partially torn ligaments in his right ankle			2
meanwhile , @entity67 defender @entity66 will miss the second leg of the @entity70 playoff against the @entity71 on wednesday night due to a thigh injury			0
the @entity74 full - back played the full 90 minutes of saturday 's 1 - 0 win in @entity76 but sustained the problem in his left leg and will not be available for the return at the @entity67			0
@entity81 midfielder @entity80 has also been ruled out , as he has not yet recovered from a hamstring injury .			0
