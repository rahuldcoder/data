i 'm not one of those crazy @entity3 -- you know , those fanatics who go to @entity7 conventions and own all kinds of preciously cheesy @entity7 memorabilia			1
all i have is a model communicator with a flip - lid that makes three different sound effects			1
and a @entity13 command badge			1
and the complete @entity17 set of the @entity7 animated series			1
and knowledge of every plot line of every episode of the original series			1
and , somewhere in my mom 's attic , an original hardbound edition of " @entity26 , " which contains the schematics of every class of starship in the @entity13 , as well as the color schemes and insignia for all @entity33 uniforms			2
and , of course , there 's my official first - grade school portrait , taken in a green @entity7 uniform ( little known fact : the yellow uniforms made famous by @entity40 originally were green but took on a more golden hue on camera )			1
so , no , i 'm not a fanatic			2
i am just an @entity44 who happened to grow up in the early 1970s , when " @entity7 " aired , in syndication , every saturday at 6 p.m. on @entity47 in the @entity49 tri-state area and occupied the entirety of my youthful imagination			1
and when i consider the massive national outpouring of love and wonder and wistfulness after the death of @entity57 , i realize the reaction is not just about the iconic character called mr. @entity60			2
it 's not even about the series itself			2
it 's about the vision of society that " @entity7 " embodied			1
imagine : @entity74 and @entity75 , people of @entity69 and @entity70 and @entity71 descent , humans and @entity73 , all thriving together as a crew without having to downplay their differences -- indeed , by activating those differences			2
that vision must have seemed truly like science fiction to adults living through the fractious , polarized , flying - apart ' 70s			2
it seems similarly fantastic in our own times			2
but it 's a vision that endures , especially in the heart of a second - generation kid like me			2
as the son of @entity91 immigrants , growing up on a mainly white suburban street called @entity93 , i was especially susceptible to such a vision			0
" @entity7 " showed me a way of being -- of being @entity44 -- that was about inclusion without assimilation			1
participation without self - obliteration			0
its diversity was not mere tokenism ; its diversity was in fact the raw material of excellence			0
and all that diversity was subsumed to a larger cause ( that of the @entity13 ) and a more urgent mission ( that of the @entity109 )			0
you might think that because i 'm asian i was drawn to @entity111 as a role model			0
or that because my bowl cut looked startlingly like @entity60 's i was drawn to him			0
i did like @entity114 as @entity111 ( and love him even more today on social media )			0
and i definitely rocked the bowl cut			0
but the genius of the show was that it allowed a young viewer to identify with characters beyond the surface markers of identity			1
whatever i might have looked like , in my mind i was @entity40			0
i spent countless hours pretending to be him , conjuring up scenes of dangerous exploration and silently narrating a captain 's log as i moved cautiously through my house grasping a wooden phaser my neighbor had jigsawed for me			0
other times i would just revel in being part of this @entity13 , this greater good			0
as my mom made stir - fry i would lie on the kitchen floor , moving my flattened palm above me like it was the @entity109 traversing the galaxy			0
i would go through reams of the " bai zhi " ( white paper ) my dad brought from the office , drawing colorful storybooks with brand - new " @entity7 " adventures			1
i was never conscious of why i was so drawn to this imaginary realm			0
but i see today how much it shaped my spirit			0
the nation i 'm trying to build in my work as a grownup looks a lot like the society i lost myself in as a boy			1
today in @entity44 life , when we are divided along so many chasms of race , class , faith and ideology , when it 's becoming more challenging than ever to sustain a cohesive sense of shared identity , we should remember two lessons from " @entity7			1
" first , what matters most is not diversity but what we do with it -- how we make inclusive institutions and experiences that fully leverage its power			1
and second , we have a greater mission than mere expression of self			0
as citizens of the @entity44 , we 're here to show the world how to be a unified crew			1
we 've got some work to do			0
" live long and prosper " were perhaps mr. @entity60 's most famous watchwords			1
but to my mind , his character conjures up a different dictum : " @entity185			0
" from many , one			0
a more earthly ambition , perhaps , but still worthy of our imagination .			1

@entity189 : i was fully into @entity7 as a young boy in an immigrant household
in my first grade imagination , i was anticipating the kind of world we *'d* like to live in now .
