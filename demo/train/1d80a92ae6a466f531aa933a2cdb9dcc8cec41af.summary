@entity0 -- @entity2 , @entity3 , @entity4 : sensational trials with national buzz covered gavel - to - gavel on television and on the @entity8			1
all ended with verdicts that , to some , seemed to make a mockery of the law			1
but did they really ? did @entity4 really get away with murder as one of the jurors -- juror b - 29 -- in the case suggested in an @entity19 interview ? that same juror said she stands by the verdict , even though she clearly agonized over the outcome			1
' boycott @entity24 ' is n't so simple , experts say from a public opinion standpoint , the question is whether @entity4 committed a crime for which he was acquitted			1
but from a legal standpoint , the question is whether the prosecution was able to prove each and every element of its case -- whether murder or manslaughter -- beyond a reasonable doubt			1
in the @entity4 , @entity2 and @entity39 cases , the answer was no. for the prosecution working one of these high profile trials , the failure to prove the case is almost never a result of failure to try			1
more often than not , it 's a result of missing pieces of the puzzle , and the unpredictability of taking a case to trial in the first place			1
prosecutors and defense attorneys go to war over a defendant			1
they chose jurors from a pool presented to them			1
the jurors promise to decide the case on the merits			2
but each and every juror brings his or her own life experience to the table			2
and when they start to deliberate the case , they are on their own			2
while we only get see to the biggest cases on tv , this drama over reasonable doubt plays out all across the country every day			1
and just like juror b - 29 in the @entity4 case , some of the people who decide the facts walk away with a deep sense of regret that marks them for life			1
that happened to me , too			2
i am one of those former jurors who is still haunted by a verdict			1
probably my most painful experience with the justice system was when , in the mid- ' 90s , i was called on to help decide a case			2
i was chosen as foreman of a jury in a criminal trial in @entity96			2
it was a horrible set of facts			2
and the outcome is still bitter to me			2
the child in question -- a little girl -- had been sexually assaulted			1
and a grown man with a long list of personal problems had been charged in the case			2
part of the evidence showed the girl had contracted a venereal disease as a result of the encounter the defendant was charged with			0
police : robbers tell man , ' this is for @entity119 ' the defense was simple and straightforward			0
the defendant had gotten a checkup right around the time authorities said the girl was assaulted			0
and the defendant 's medical report indicated that he had tested negative for the venereal disease			0
the defendant admitted he had been near the child			0
but he adamantly denied sexually assaulting her			0
there were no other witnesses			0
the trial lasted for a couple days , and i believe we deliberated almost as long			0
on the first vote , shortly after hearing the judges instructions and retiring to the jury room for deliberations , i was shocked to discover that only two people , myself and a woman juror , had come to the conclusion that the defendant was guilty			1
i was suspicious of his demeanor			0
i was skeptical about the medical report			0
i struggled , i fought			0
i demanded that my colleagues on the jury use their common sense			0
i suggested maybe he took penicillin or something			0
but all that was conjecture , the other jurors said			0
there was no evidence of treatment for the disease			0
but we kept coming back to that single piece of paper , the medical report that was impossible to deny			0
after a truly bitter experience , and fighting for justice for that little girl and her family , i voted not guilty and so did the other " holdout "			1
and the most bitter moment of all , as the jury foreman , was the reading of the verdict			1
i felt i had let that little girl down			0
i left the courthouse and sat on a stoop in front with my head in my hands			0
i will never forget that feeling			0
reasonable doubt is a bitter pill to swallow sometimes			1
but it is the law .			1

in *recent* high profile cases -- @entity4 , @entity39 , @entity2 -- verdict did n't always match *popular* sentiment
juries were asked to rule on guilt *vs.* reasonable doubt
although decisions may be *consistent* with the law , not guilty verdicts leave some wondering
