@entity0 -- @entity3 protesters are giving their government the silent treatment			1
hundreds of men and women stood silently tuesday in @entity0 's @entity8 emulating the performance artist whose quiet protest monday night quickly gained him the nickname " @entity13			1
" for more than five hours , @entity13 had stared toward a portrait of @entity15 , the founder of the modern @entity3 state , whose likeness adorns the side of the @entity19 in the square			0
police eventually moved in to arrest many of those who had joined him , but it was unclear tuesday whether @entity13 was in custody			1
his quiet defiance came after police broke up weekend anti-government protests with tear gas and water cannon			1
@entity3 has been wracked by more than two weeks of protests against the government of prime minister @entity32			1
but many of those who joined @entity35 said they were standing only for peace , not taking sides			2
" i 'm standing against all violence , " said @entity38 , one of those arrested			2

the demonstrators tried to return to the park sunday , only to be driven back by police			0
tear gas abates , music fills @entity3 's @entity74 root of protests the unrest began in @entity0 in late may , when a small group of people turned out to protest government plans to bulldoze @entity74 , the city 's last green space , and replace it with a shopping mall housed inside a replica of 19th century @entity92 barracks			1
protesters said the plans represented a creeping infringement on their rights in a secular society			1

" he said security forces were being patient , refraining from using guns even when two police officers were wounded by gunfire			0
" when their warnings are not heeded , they use tear gas , " he said			0
the police will not turn a blind eye to illegal actions , he said , in an apparent reference to the ongoing protests			0

" i am particularly concerned about allegations of excessive use of force by police against peaceful groups of protesters as this may have resulted in serious damage to health , " she said in a statement issued from @entity179			1
" reports that tear gas canisters and pepper spray were fired at people from close range , or into closed spaces , and the alleged misuse of rubber bullets , need to be promptly , effectively , credibly and transparently investigated , " @entity171 said , noting that " the atmosphere is still clearly highly combustible			0
" and @entity198 said monday that the @entity3 government 's response to weekend protests was excessive			0
" the police assault on a peaceful crowd in @entity74 and tear gas use in confined spaces showed a dangerous disregard for the well - being -- and indeed the lives -- of protesters and bystanders , " said @entity202 , senior @entity3 researcher for the rights group			1
" the repeated police violence against people who are dissatisfied with government policies has deeply polarized @entity3			0
the government urgently needs to change police tactics and issue a clear signal for restraint			1
" but @entity32 defended the police approach			1
" the police forces have passed the democracy test , " he said tuesday , according to the semiofficial @entity223 news service			0

letters from @entity3 , with pride ' there is a level of desperation ' while the protests are unlikely to threaten the rule of @entity32 , who is credited with overseeing a decade of economic growth , they are raising questions about what critics say is an increasingly authoritarian style of governing			2
