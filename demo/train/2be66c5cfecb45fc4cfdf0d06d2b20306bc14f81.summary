-- as the stock market opened friday with a ring of the bell by @entity5 , all eyes were on @entity6 -- the social media @entity9 he nursed from a dorm - room project to one of @entity13 's hottest prospects ever			1
@entity6 , or " fb " as it 's now known to investors , may have made amateur analysts on the @entity17 go wild			2
but on the @entity18 , it was a less exciting ride -- ending the day at a price pretty much exactly where it began			0
but ' friending ' both started and ended the day at just over $ 38 a share			1
@entity6 's was the biggest opening ever for a tech company and the third - largest ipo in @entity28 history , behind only @entity29 and @entity30			1
on the @entity17 , reactions ran the gamut from deliriously hopeful to harshly negative for the social - media giant 's @entity13 potential			0
" a $ 104 billion market capitalization puts @entity6 at more than 100 times its trailing earnings , " wrote @entity35 and @entity36 for technology blog @entity37			1
" that 's a big multiple to live up to , and it will likely need to add bold new revenue streams to justify the mammoth valuation			0
" and it was n't just the pros weighing in			0
in fact , it seemed like everyone on the @entity50 had an opinion			0
@entity52 posted a poll ( obviously not scientific ) asking readers where they thought the $ 38 stock would be by the end of the day friday			1
early friday , a pessimistic 15 % said under $ 35			2
but the biggest cluster of respondents had guessed somewhere between $ 40 and 55			0
( 15 % said $ 40 to 45 , another 13 % said $ 45 to 50 and , yes , yet another 12 % said $ 50 - 55 )			0
a hopeful 10 % predicted the stock would skyrocket at otherworldly levels , winding up over $ 90 a share			1
@entity6 's new billionaires results were similar on another site that sprung up , @entity66			2
its graph showed the biggest number of predictions clustering around what ultimately would be an overly optimistic $ 50 mark			0
on rival network @entity74 , many observers seemed to be rooting against @entity6 and its early investors , finding a measure of glee in the fact that the price did n't skyrocket as some had predicted			1
" @entity6 stock has already started to tank , " wrote user @entity82 ( yes , with a healthy dose of hyperbole )			1
" in my best @entity88 voice from @entity89 -- " ha ! @entity90 ! " there was this swipe at youthful startup culture from tweeter @entity94 : " @entity96 ? keeping $ fb over 38 or trying to get hired at @entity6 being over 38 ? " and then there was this sports metaphor , which referenced a certain polarizing @entity100 star			1
" rooting against @entity6 stock price > [ is greater than ] rooting against @entity104 , " wrote a user named @entity102			1
more sober - minded watchers , however , noted that on @entity13 , when an opening stock sticks close to where it started , it means it was probably priced correctly to begin with			0
" few hours into trading and @entity6 's stocks maintain a $ 40 value , " wrote @entity110			1
" no drop , no frenzy behaviour , no wild fluctuations			0
serious matter ! " while opinions in the business and tech communities have differed on whether the massive social network is a good investment , analysts have largely been bullish on the stock			2
there 's been heavy demand , leading @entity6 on wednesday to announce it will sell about 25 % more shares than it had originally planned , bringing its total to 421 million shares			2
at @entity0 content partner @entity136 , a blog that got its start focusing exclusively on social media and saw its popularity rise as @entity6 's did , the staff geared up by creating an ipo - inspired playlist on music site @entity130 ( which , perhaps not coincidentally , is accessible only through a @entity6 account )			2
making the list ? " @entity142 , " by the @entity144 , " @entity145 " by the @entity146 , " " @entity147 ) by @entity148 and " if i had $ 1,000,000 " by @entity149 , among others			0
@entity151 and @entity0 's @entity152 contributed to this report .			0

new : @entity6 stock closed nearly where it opened friday
new : on rival @entity74 , some *smirked* at lack of a price jump
@entity162 , almost every financial or tech expert has an opinion
*facebook* on *thursday* *afternoon* set its *initial* share price at $ 38
