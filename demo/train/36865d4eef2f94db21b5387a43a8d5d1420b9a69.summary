-- @entity2 's technology certainly can map out driving directions and organize e-mail ( or even make cars drive themselves )			1
but can its digital tools take down drug cartels ? the company says it can , with your help			1
" we believe that technology has the power to expose and dismantle global criminal networks , which depend on secrecy and discretion in order to function , " @entity2 said in a blog post this week			1
" and for the past few months , we 've been working with people fighting on the front line to gain a better understanding of what drives these networks and how they function			2
" in coordination with the @entity25 and the @entity26 , @entity27 -- the company 's " think / do tank " -- hosted a conference in @entity31 this week			1
its goal : to come up with ways technology can be used to help dismantle illicit networks , from the drug and arms trades to human trafficking			1
the event was called the @entity40 , short for @entity41 : forces in @entity43 , and it was designed largely to brainstorm these issues and to come up with technological solutions that could be implemented in the future			1
a @entity48 channel has been created to house ideas from the event , but it was largely empty as of thursday			0
@entity2 says it wants to use technology to help people within illicit networks , as well as helping members of the public to shed light on the networks ' illegal activities and ultimately dismantle them			1
the stakes for these activities are high			0
the @entity62 estimates $ 2.1 trillion worth of illicit trade occurred in 2009			2
violence also tends to surround these enterprises			0
nearly 50,000 people have died in @entity68 's drug violence since 2006 , according to @entity68 authorities			0
as part of the efforts , @entity70 also announced the creation of an app and website called the @entity76			1
it 's designed to help consumers and international law - enforcement groups track products that may be counterfeit or were traded illegally			1
a report about the app on @entity70 's website ( @entity84 ) says the app will be available for @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 and @entity89 devices			1
it did not appear on thursday to be available for download			0
consumers can use the app to scan items and determine whether they were traded or created illegally			2
illicit products are reported to authorities			1
the efforts by @entity27 aim to go beyond using technology to expose wrongs in war zones and in illicit networks			1
the company wants to use tech to make a difference			1
" what we have learned from @entity106 is just getting content out into the public domain is not enough			0
simple naming and shaming does n't solve the problems , " @entity109 , director of @entity27 , told @entity110 in an interview at the conference			0
" it gives people a voice but at the end of the day the way you 're going to solve these problems is some kind of partnership between humans and computers working together			0
" technology could also be used in closed states like @entity130 , @entity127 writes in a wrap - up of the @entity40 on a @entity25 blog			1
" illicit networks flourish in the darkness , where corruption is the norm and transparency is absent			2
this problem is most acute in so - called ' mafia states , ' where the government has become a full - fledged criminal enterprise -- of which the ' soprano state ' of @entity130 is the most glaring example , " he writes			0
" but no country is exempt from corruption			0
and where transparency is lacking , there is no way for citizens to fight back			0
" in a way , by trying to address these problems , @entity2 is acknowledging it has had a hand in fostering them , too			2
" internet - enabled technology , that which networks us together , has done a huge amount for humanity in general , " @entity156 , the principal at @entity27 , said at the @entity157 earlier this year , according to a live blog			0
" but it 's also introduced complications , such as child pornography , transnational crime , and government repression			0
technology has made these bad things easier			0
simply , when you combine human beings with machines , the results can be marvelous , or they can be malevolent			0
" @entity2 , whose unofficial motto is " @entity177 , " says that any efforts to raise awareness about these problems could only help			2
" we are trying to move the ball forward , " @entity2 's executive chairman , @entity181 , said in an interview with the @entity183			2
" it seems to me if we can increase awareness of illicit networks , that in and of itself is progress			2
