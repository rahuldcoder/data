-- @entity1 is like no stripper you 've ever seen before			0
for one , he 's built like a wrestler with a rainbow afro that " @entity6 " could only dream of			1
for two , his stage is a hurtling train			0
and for three -- this is the clincher -- the only item of clothing he 's likely to shed is his baseball cap			1
but boy , does this 20 - year - old from the @entity15 know how to dance around a pole			1
" we tell people we 're part time strippers , " he says over the phone , the sound of cars blaring in the background of his native @entity21			1
" it 's just a little joke , it gets people to laugh			1
" " we call it @entity30 " @entity1 is the founder of @entity36 ( we are @entity37 ) , a group of 15 dancers whose gravity - defying pole pirouettes -- accompanied by thumping beatbox tunes -- have earned them quite a reputation on the city 's subway			1
every week the young men -- aged between 17 and 21 -- perform their special brand of breakdancing turned ballet on the underground trains ; delighting , bemusing , and sometimes infuriating commuters			1
the urban acrobats swing from handrails or backflip down aisles , with the ease and bravado of youngsters who grew up using the city as a giant dance floor			2
" @entity61 , " " @entity62 , " " @entity63 " -- these are the names of some of @entity36 's signature moves , performed with a cheeky swagger to their own mish - mash recordings of hip hop , funk , and electro beats			1
" the way we move -- our energy , our shoe tricks , our hat tricks -- is something that 's completely new , " said @entity1			1
" we call it ' @entity30 ' -- it 's a mixture of dances put together , " he added			2
" there 's this dance , the ' @entity78 ' ( made popular in the 1920s ) , and that 's one of the closest things we 've been able to find to it			1
" " everyone has an opinion " " it 's showtime ! " has become something of a rallying cry for the buskers , who usually split into smaller groups of three , targeting the busiest carriages to earn up to $ 100 a day			1
watch one of the many @entity94 clips of the dancers expertly twirling their caps on a perfectly poised elbow or nonchalantly " @entity98 " along a trundling train , and the reactions are as varied as @entity21 themselves -- grandmothers cheer , hipsters appear bored , and tourists scramble for their phones			1
" there are a lot of copycats out there now , " says @entity1 , who first started busking seven years ago			0
" everyone has an opinion			0
but this is how we make a living , so we do n't have to ask our parents for money or have a boring job			2
we 're just trying to do something positive			0
" not everyone sees their shows in the same light , with a @entity123 article on the troupe attracting some unfavorable comments			2
" they definitely have some impressive moves			2
they are also extremely annoying , and more importantlyâ € ” dangerous , " wrote @entity128 has @entity1 ever hurt anyone during his act ? " no. just a little graze , but i 've never really hit anyone , " he said			0
" people do n't know i 've been doing it for years			0
i know what i 'm doing			0
" from @entity15 to big time ? it was as young teens growing up in low income households in @entity141 , @entity142 and the @entity15 , that @entity1 and his fancy - footed friends first came up with the idea of busking as a way to raise money to attend local dance competitions -- or " battles			1
" " you had to pay $ 10 to get in , so asking your mom every week got annoying			0
or they probably wo n't have the money to give to you right away			0
" " we had an idea to go on the train and make the money ourselves			2
and the money was good -- we made over the amount we needed			0
so we just kept on going			0
" the troupe has since appeared in various video clips and mini documentaries , with member " @entity161 " even taking his deft hat tricks and comedic style across the country on " @entity165			2
" " my main goal is to get off the train and work with more people , " said @entity1			0
" i want to bring @entity30 to the world			0
