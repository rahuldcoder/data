-- now that @entity2 have won control of the @entity4 , @entity1 is awash with rumors and speculation about how president @entity7 and the @entity8 will get along			1
@entity11 dr. @entity10 are already yakking about how the two sides should just get along " for the sake of the children ... er , country			0
" but this is not a troubled marriage			0
it 's more complicated than even that			2
rather than look to the psychobabble of self - help , we should look at the hard - earned successes of difficult peace negotiations between nations			0
president @entity7 , house speaker @entity26 and presumptive senate majority leader @entity27 should begin with what peace negotiators call " @entity30			1
" @entity30 's between nation begin with cultural exchanges -- like sending @entity34 ping - pong players to @entity35			1
this is why a bourbon summit would be useful , and i hope sen. @entity38 takes the president up on his offer			1
but once you 've broken the ice by breaking out the bourbon , where do you go ? what issues do you start negotiating ? the easier ones			2
it is a troubling sign that , in their post-election press conferences , both @entity7 and @entity38 kept circling back to immigration			1
at one level this is obvious : immigration is an important national priority on which the two parties seem deeply divided			0
that 's why they should not start with immigration			1
instead they should start small			2
one place where @entity61 and @entity62 found they could agree , when they were at this juncture in the mid- 1990s was biomedical research			1
each wanted to build on @entity34 's lead in the field , and so they passed legislation to double funding for the @entity72 over five years			1
( the five years extended into the @entity74 presidency , and to his credit he honored the deal			2
) the @entity72 has been in the news recently , since its director , dr. @entity78 , said we would already have an @entity81 vaccine but for budget cuts			2
it is simply true that , after the @entity62 - @entity86 - @entity74 increase , @entity72 funding has flat - lined			1
in fact , @entity72 has lost 25 % of its purchasing power , due to budget constraints and the moronic policy sequester			2
boosting @entity72 would be good for the economy			1
a $ 3 billion investment championed by @entity94 sen. @entity93 and signed into law by president @entity96 paid for the research that decoded the human genome			2
that $ 3 billion investment has spurred -- get this -- $ 965 billion in economic activity , including 53,000 new jobs and $ 290 billion in personal income , according to a study by the @entity104 , a coalition of research institutions , patient and health advocates and private industry			0
boosting @entity72 is also good politics			1
i am on the @entity111 of @entity112 in @entity113			0
@entity112 is the number - one recipient of research grants from the @entity115 , which is part of @entity72			1
and you know which senators have @entity112 in their state ? you got it : @entity122 and @entity123			0
one a tea party favorite and one a @entity127 hero			0
if they would get on board with boosting @entity72 funding , a whole lot of their constituents on both sides of the aisle would be happy			1
championing biomedical research did not dent @entity61 's conservative credentials , nor did it hurt @entity62 among liberals			1
because cancer knows no partisan boundaries			0
one in two @entity34 men will develop cancer			0
and one in three @entity34 women will			0
if you 're reading this at the office ( i promise not to tell ) look around : half the guys and a third of the women will , one day , sit in an office and hear a doc say , " you have cancer			0
" think about that as you have dinner with your family , when you 're at a football game this weekend or in church this sunday			0
president @entity7 lost his mother and grandmother to cancer			2
each of them know the pain of loss and the promise of biomedical research			0
so my advice to them is to start with the basics : basic science , and then work their way up to the more intractable problems .			0

@entity179 : @entity181 summit for @entity7 , @entity38 a good idea . here 's what to talk about :
medical research funding was common ground for @entity86 , @entity62 at similar political juncture
@entity179 says they pushed doubling @entity72 funding in 5 years ; it *benefited* nation , economy
@entity194 : no @entity72 funding *stalled* . boosting it is good politics , a good place for the two to start
