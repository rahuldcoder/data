" it is ridiculous that these men even had to think twice about blessing a meal , " @entity14 founder @entity14 said in a written statement			0
" to criminalize the prayer conflicts with our nation 's founding and guiding principles and goes directly against our constitutionally protected rights			0
" but the @entity50 , whose lawsuit led to the consent decree , has maintained students have a right to be free from administrators who foist their personal religious beliefs on them			1
still , an @entity50 representative has said the organization " never suggested " people should go to jail for violating the decree , and the organization was not involved in the criminal proceedings			1

" @entity22 complied with the request and offered the prayer at the event			0

" it added , " the tradition of offering prayer in @entity16 has become so interwoven into our nation 's spiritual heritage that to charge someone criminally for engaging in such a practice would astonish the men who founded this country on religious liberty			0
