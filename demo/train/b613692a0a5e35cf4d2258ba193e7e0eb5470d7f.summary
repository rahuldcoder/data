@entity0 -- another attempted terrorist attack on the @entity4 in coming months is " certain , " the heads of major @entity4 intelligence agencies told a @entity7 committee tuesday			1
@entity12 remains the top security threat to the @entity4 , but a growing cyber-security threat also must be addressed by the @entity4 intelligence community , the heads of the @entity9 , the @entity10 and other agencies told the @entity16			1
the hearing covered a range of security issues and became contentious , with republicans on the committee arguing with @entity22 counterparts and the intelligence chiefs on how the @entity25 administration has handled terrorism suspects such as the failed @entity27 of a @entity4 airliner			1
asked by committee chair sen. @entity30 , @entity31 , of the likelihood of another attempted terror attack on the @entity4 in the next three to six months , the officials agreed with director of national intelligence @entity35 's initial answer of " certain			1
" while none of the intelligence chiefs , who included cia director @entity40 , fbi director @entity41 and others , cited a specific pending threat , their testimony made clear that an evolving @entity12 remains their top concern			1
" my greatest concern , and what keeps me awake at night , is that @entity12 and its terrorist allies and affiliates could very well attack the @entity4 , " @entity40 said			1
@entity12 is adapting methods to make their plots more difficult to detect , shifting from large attacks with multiple players to using individuals without any background in terrorism , @entity40 said			2
he noted the @entity57 attempt as an example , saying the suspect had a @entity4 visa but little history of involvement with terrorist groups			1
" obviously , they decided to make use of someone like that within a very short period of time " of the suspect coming into contact with @entity12 , @entity40 said			1
@entity35 also said that deciding whether to prosecute terrorist suspects in a criminal court or by a military commission should be decided on a case - by - case basis			2
the question involved the handling of @entity27 , the suspect in the failed @entity57 bombing of a @entity4 airliner			1
@entity20 have criticized security officials for charging the suspect in criminal court instead of treating him as an enemy combatant to be prosecuted by a military commission			2
sen. @entity85 , @entity86 , said it was a mistake for security officials to have read abdulmutallab his miranda rights on the night he was arrested , instead of first conducting further interrogation			2
@entity35 , however , said the handling of terror suspects requires flexibility to allow for the appropriate response in each case			2
fbi director @entity41 agreed , saying that providing a suspect with @entity98 rights can bring better information than traditional military or intelligence interrogation			2
@entity41 noted that incentive agreements with suspects have many times resulted in gaining " actionable intelligence " that otherwise might never have come forward			0
@entity20 sens. @entity106 of @entity107 and @entity108 of @entity109 , asked why @entity27 was read his @entity98 rights so quickly			0
@entity41 said the decision must be considered in the context of the full investigation			0
" you 're looking at it through the rear - view mirror , " @entity41 said			0
" do not discount what has happened or what does happen after that in terms of gaining intelligence			0
" later tuesday , a law enforcement official told @entity123 had been talking to investigators since last week and providing useful , current and actionable intelligence -- leads that the @entity10 and intelligence officials have been actively following up			0
the official was not authorized to speak for attribution because the case remains under investigation			0
@entity41 said none of the intelligence chiefs at tuesday 's hearing were consulted about the decision to read abdulmutallab his @entity98 rights			1
that decision was made by the chief security interrogator at the scene in consultation with the @entity140 , @entity41 said			0
the discussion included a harsh exchange among committee members , with @entity22 sens. @entity30 , @entity144 of @entity145 and @entity146 of @entity147 accusing @entity20 sens. @entity85 and @entity148 of @entity149 of politicizing the issue			0
@entity30 noted the policy of charging terrorists in @entity4 criminal courts dates back to the @entity155 administration , while @entity146 called @entity20 framing of the issue " fallacious			0
" @entity148 also asked @entity35 if any evidence showed that president @entity25 's plan to close the @entity161 , @entity162 , detention facility for terrorism suspects would reduce the terrorist threat against the @entity4			1
@entity148 and @entity85 said they opposed the plan because it would bring terrorism suspects to @entity4 soil			0
@entity35 responded that @entity161 has become a major recruiting tool for @entity12 , setting off an exchange with @entity148 that concluded with @entity35 saying : " @entity161 has achieved a sort of mythic quality that helps @entity12			1
" in his written testimony to the committee , @entity35 said it would take the capture or deaths of @entity12 's top two leaders -- @entity178 and @entity179 -- to possibly end the group 's intent to attack the @entity4			1
on the cyber-security threat , @entity35 's written testimony described an inability to contend with attacks using computer networks and telecommunications systems			1
" sensitive information is stolen daily from both government and private sector networks , undermining confidence in our information systems , and in the very information these systems were intended to convey , " @entity35 wrote			0
" we often find persistent , unauthorized , and at times , unattributable presences on exploited networks , the hallmark of an unknown adversary intending to do far more than merely demonstrate skill or mock a vulnerability			0
" @entity30 agreed with @entity35 's assessment that the nation was unprepared for the kinds of possible cyber attacks it could face			2
" the need to develop an overall cyber-security strategy is very clear , " @entity30 said .			0

new : capture of @entity12 's top leaders needed to possibly end attempts , @entity35 says
new : @entity35 defends decision to read @entity57 day suspect rights , says it *yielded* useful intel
@entity12 remains the top security threat to the @entity4 , agency heads say
@entity4 intelligence community also faces growing *cybersecurity* threat
