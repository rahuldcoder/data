@entity0 , @entity1 -- the bloated @entity4 has crested at an historic high in @entity0 , @entity1 , but floodwaters likely will remain at or near their current level for several days , authorities said sunday			1
" at this point , the river has had its crest so far in @entity0 , but a number of locations downstream still have some high water yet to come , " said @entity8 , a forecaster with the @entity9 in @entity10			1
a crest is defined as the high point of the water during a flood before it begins to recede			1
a boil - water order , issued as a precaution on saturday , remains in effect			2
and experts caution that although the water rose quickly -- flooding up to 4,000 homes to some degree -- it will be slow to recede			1
" we did have a couple of close calls at the temporary dikes last night , " @entity0 mayor @entity28 told reporters sunday			1
" both those areas have been repaired			2
" he reminded residents not to enter the evacuation zone			0
the river at @entity0 crested at 1,561.72 feet above sea level sunday morning , said @entity8 -- below earlier predictions but still almost 4 feet above an 1881 record			1
water levels had fallen to 1,561.48 feet by sunday night , @entity8 said			2
many residents of @entity0 , who evacuated ahead of the rising water , approached the water 's edge on sunday , hoping to catch a glimpse of their homes , said @entity2 's @entity49			1
most often , they are disappointed at the devastation they see , he said			0
@entity49 said when he toured the hardest - hit area by boat , several residents gave him their addresses and asked him to check on their homes			2
everyone was hoping their home might be the one that was spared , he said , but he had to bring back bad news			0
" it 's a somber feeling , sitting here , " said resident @entity62			1
he recalled " listening to the sirens go off , and they evacuated us , and coming back the next day and seeing this ... it 's disheartening			1
" but , he said , " we 'll get there			0
" these personal struggles come as local , state and federal authorities rush to minimize the damage to property and maximize security and safety of residents			0
three recovery centers will open on monday -- two in @entity0 and one in @entity10 , gov. @entity83 told reporters			1
residents can visit the location to find out about assistance programs and " meet with someone who is able to answer your questions directly , " he said			0
but , he noted , it is not necessary for residents to visit the centers to register for disaster assistance , which can be done by telephone or online			0
he said he had toured the area , and it was " sobering , to say the least			0

@entity110 has lived in @entity0 his entire life			1
he has sandbagged his home , located just outside the evacuation zone , with the help of neighbors , and said sunday it is dry for now			0
he is , however , very concerned about the water			0
" i flushed my toilet this morning , and the water was red , " he said			0
still , he said he is able to see the positives when neighbors , relatives and friends bond to get through a disaster the best they can			0
the @entity4 flows through the center of @entity0 , a city of about 36,000			1
about a third of the city 's population is under evacuation orders			2
about 900 @entity131 soldiers and about 100 airmen from @entity133 are assisting in the @entity0 area , authorities said			1
@entity0 officials told residents saturday that tap water should be boiled for at least a minute before consuming in order to kill any dangerous organisms			1
the focal point in @entity0 continues to be the @entity141 , a critical north - south route through town			1
officials have been working round - the - clock to prevent the river from inundating nearby routes , all part of larger efforts aimed at preventing @entity0 from effectively being split in half by the flooding			1
" it 's really important that ( @entity141 ) bridge stays open , " said @entity153 , spokeswoman for the @entity154 of @entity155			2
@entity158 rep. @entity158 said he had been in touch with officials in @entity161 -- which has authorized @entity163 to grant assistance -- and expressed optimism that the government will work well with residents to overcome the challenges			0
" you 're seeing people at the highest levels working together , putting politics behind them , " said @entity1 's lone congressman			1
@entity158 , though , cautioned that the " marathon " was far from over			0
for instance , water levels near the @entity141 were still expected to remain around 1,561 feet through tuesday -- with a slow drop over the coming week			1
and the worst is yet to come for other @entity1 cities and towns			0
in @entity184 , " we 'll be approaching peak levels over next 24 hours , " meteorologist @entity181 of the @entity9 in @entity10 said early sunday morning			1
water levels in @entity186 are expected to peak monday or tuesday			2
the situation prompted the evacuation saturday of @entity184 's 350 residents as water from the @entity4 began to slosh up a main street through town , according to the @entity194 @entity193			1
@entity197 and @entity196 's house -- less than a mile from the @entity4 -- was one of those flooded on sunday			1
even though a crew of more than three dozen friends and family helped them evacuate on monday -- scouring the house for everything that was n't attached to the walls -- @entity206 said saturday his wife was still devastated			0
" we 've had many homes over our life , and she finally got the house of her dreams , " he said			2
" she is absolutely devastated , bawling all the time			0
" @entity196 , who built the house , is n't so busted up			0
no one was hurt , and they can build again , he said			0
still , he said , " it will never be the same			0
" @entity2 's @entity219 , @entity220 , @entity221 , @entity222 and @entity223 contributed to this report .			2
