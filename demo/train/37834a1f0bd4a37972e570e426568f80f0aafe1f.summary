here 's a look at some of the techniques the @entity3 used to interrogate detainees that were included in a @entity7 report released tuesday			1
the @entity3 conducted at least two mock executions -- among other techniques that went unreported in the agency 's cables			1
others included " nudity , dietary manipulation , exposure to cold temperatures , cold showers , " and rough takedowns			1
in another passage , the mock executions are included in a section that also mentions techniques like " placing pressure on a detainee 's artery ... blowing cigarette or cigar smoke into a detainee 's face , using cold water to interrogate detainees , and subjecting a detainee to a ' hard takedown			1
those " rough " or " hard " takedowns involved @entity3 officers rushing into a detainee 's cell , stripping him naked and running him up and down a long hall while slapping and punching him			2
" as they ran him along the corridor , a couple of times he fell and they dragged him through the dirt , " the report says			1
the @entity3 often used sleep deprivation , which " involved keeping detainees awake for up to 180 hours , usually standing or in stress positions , at times with their hands shackled above their heads			1
the @entity3 decided that interrogating @entity54 would take precedence over his medical care			2
he almost died as a result of waterboarding			2
in at least one waterboarding session , @entity54 " became completely unresponsive , with bubbles rising through his open , full mouth			2
" he remained unresponsive until medical intervention , when he regained consciousness and expelled " copious amounts of liquid			2
the first prisoner at the @entity69 detention facility , @entity70 , was kept in " isolation in total darkness			0
" the @entity3 gave him increasingly worse food , kept him in uncomfortably cold temperatures , kept him shackled and hooded and played music 24 hours a day			0
he wore a diaper and had no access to toilets			0
and he was described as being left hanging -- with one or both wrists handcuffed to an overhead bar so he could n't lower his arms -- for 22 hours a day for two straight days in an attempt to " ' break ' his resistance			0
the @entity3 threatened the families of detainees			0
it used that prisoner 's " fear for the well - being of his family to our benefit , " according to the report , by " using ' vague threats ' to create a ' mind virus			1
' " in another section , the report says " @entity3 officers also threatened at least three detainees with harm to their families -- to include threats to harm the children of a detainee , threats to sexually abuse the mother of a detainee and a threat to ' cut [ a detainee 's ] mother 's throat			1
one detainee faced particularly rough treatment in late 2005			0
per the report : " according to @entity3 records , @entity119 was subjected to nudity , dietary manipulation , insult slaps , abdominal slaps , attention grasps , facial holds , walling , stress positions and water dousing with 44 degree @entity130 water for 18 minutes			1
he was shackled in the standing position for 54 hours as part of sleep deprivation , and experienced swelling in his lower legs requiring blood thinner and spiral ace bandages			1
" he was moved to a sitting position , and his sleep deprivation was extended to 78 hours			1
after the swelling subsided , he was provided with more blood thinner and was returned to the standing position			0
the sleep deprivation was extended to 102 hours			1
after four hours of sleep , @entity119 was subjected to an additional 52 hours of sleep deprivation , after which @entity146 informed interrogators that eight hours was the minimum rest period between sleep deprivation sessions exceeding 48 hours			1
in addition to the swelling , @entity119 also experienced an edema on his head due to walling , abrasions on his neck and blisters on his ankles from shackles			0
" at least five @entity3 detainees were subjected to ' rectal rehydration ' or rectal feeding without documented medical necessity , " the report said			2
more specifically , " @entity166 's ' lunch tray ' of hummus , pasta with sauce , nuts and raisins was ' pureed ' and rectally infused			0
the @entity3 officers involved in the detention and interrogation program were n't the most savory bunch			0
the group " included individuals who , among other issues , had engaged in inappropriate detainee interrogations , had workplace anger management issues and had reportedly admitted to sexual assault , " the report said			1
some of those who were interrogated did n't have the best thought - out plans			0
after reading a satirical web story called " how to make an h - bomb , " @entity187 citizen @entity186 and his associate , @entity188 , conceived the " @entity190			0
" the report says : " the article instructed would - be bomb makers to enrich uranium by placing it " in a bucket , attaching it to a six - foot rope , and swinging it around your head as fast as possible for 45 minutes			2
@entity202 and @entity188 approached @entity54 in early 2002 , and later [ @entity203 ] , with their idea to build and use this device in the @entity187			0
" neither @entity54 nor @entity203 believed the plan was viable , but @entity203 provided funding for , and tasked @entity202 to conduct , an operation using natural gas to create explosions in tall buildings in the @entity187 , later known as the ' @entity213			0
