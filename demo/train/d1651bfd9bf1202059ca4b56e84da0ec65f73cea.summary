-- despite what his past and current on - screen personas might suggest , in person , actor @entity1 is extremely cordial and not at all criminal - minded			1
@entity1 is probably best known for his role as gay stick - up boy @entity6 on @entity8 's " @entity7 " and currently plays bootlegger @entity9 on " @entity10			1
" and while the actor is set to play @entity12 member @entity11 in a forthcoming film about the rapper , @entity1 is most excited about his new role as an executive producer			1
" when i saw this on @entity18 , i had no idea what i was watching			0
i was like , are the feds going to run up in here and ask me what i know ? ! it was that eerie , " the @entity24 - born @entity1 said of his latest project , the independent film " @entity27 , " which will be released on dvd june 19			1
in what @entity1 calls " ' the @entity31 ' meets the hood , " " @entity27 " documents real - life stick - up boy @entity33			1
@entity37 's robberies of rival dealers , gunfights and life in the @entity43 @entity42 neighborhood known as " @entity44 " are all documented via handheld camera footage , leaving viewers to guess what is and is n't real			2
@entity1 caught wind of the film via a trailer that leaked on @entity51			1
from there , @entity1 reached out the director , asked to be an executive producer and offered to do what he could to promote the film and tell @entity33 's story , which he got to know more of when they met in @entity59			1
the film is being released via @entity1 ' new production company , @entity61			1
while @entity33 was quick to get caught up in the hype of @entity1 ' characters , the latter made clear it 's not his fictional accounts that deserve credit ; it 's the real - life people who inspire them			1
" i said , ' i commend you			0
i get paid to be you , what you really are , ' " @entity1 said			2
" he did n't make excuses for who and what he was , and it kind of reminded me in a weird sense of @entity6			2
" among fans ( counted among that group is president @entity79 ) , @entity6 has been dubbed the best character on " @entity7 " and is the role @entity1 is probably best known for			1
@entity1 also said playing the fearless , drug - dealer - robbing and seemingly invincible @entity6 actually put him in a dark place			1
i did n't have that growing up			0
i had issues , " @entity1 admitted			2
" when i got this unconditional love from everybody and people perceived me as not caring what you thought about me , that felt good even though it was not real			0
" @entity1 said he also dealt with his own " racism " with " @entity7 , " especially when the first season with a predominantly black cast was followed with a second season with more white characters			1
he took his concerns to the show 's creator , @entity103			0
" i got real bitter and angry , " he said of his initial response			0
" i was like , ' @entity106 , what 's up with that ? that 's kind of corny			0
' he was like , ' trust me , if we would have went right back into the hood in season two , it would have made your world seem so small			2
' " after his chat with @entity103 , @entity1 said , he realized the show was more of a portrait of @entity121 's social breakdown , not just black @entity121			2
from there , @entity1 knew he wanted to tell more stories like those in and around @entity125 , where the " @entity7 " was filmed			1
@entity1 does believe race may have played into why neither he nor the show ever won a @entity128 during his five successful seasons			2
" i do n't think @entity130 was ready to have that many young black actors running around with statues in the town , " he said , noting that the lack of a statue ca n't come close to the career opportunities he 's been provided , thanks to the show 's success			0
with that success has been the ability to help bring awareness to the real people behind " @entity27 " and the chance to bring a real human element to the story of @entity11 in film " @entity149			1
" one of the most successful and notorious personalities of the legendary hip - hop collective the @entity12 , @entity11 lived a story of music , drugs and violence , which came to a sad conclusion with the rapper 's death from an accidental drug overdose in november 2004			1
in his first leading role in a major film , @entity1 is set to play the iconic artist in the last two years of his life , as seen through the eyes of his manager , @entity165 , a former @entity166 intern			1
like the man himself , the movie about @entity11 's life has been fodder for debate over everything from the title to the subject matter			2
@entity1 ' focus is portraying the truth about the man behind the music			2
" he was n't held up in no crack house			0
he was n't on no bender			0
he died in a recording studio			0
it was just a very unfortunate accident how he lost his life , " said @entity1 , who did most of his research for the role by spending time with the late rapper 's mother			1
" she did n't make any excuses for ' @entity192 , ' as she calls him			0
but she let you know , when he died , he was n't on a suicide mission			0
he was very excited about his future			0
the things he struggled with personally -- outside of the business -- that could 've been anybody			0
i want people to walk away with an identity to his story			0
" from @entity37 to @entity6 to @entity11 , @entity1 believes he has found his calling			1
" i feel like i 've been given an opportunity to paint people that society would deem as ' the gangster , ' ' the thug , ' as a human being with raw emotions , " he said			0
" i 'm being given chance to be a voice for a people that do n't get a voice			0
