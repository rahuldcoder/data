-- when is a kiss not just a kiss ? when it 's a political undoing			0
on monday , a @entity5 newspaper posted a video showing freshman @entity5 rep. @entity7 , a conservative @entity8 and married father of five , in an extended passionate kiss			1
with someone other than his wife			0
that someone , congressional staffer @entity14 , also happens to be married , to a high school pal and campaign donor of @entity7 's , in fact			1
according to payroll records , says @entity18 , she started working for @entity7 the day after he won his seat			1
her husband , @entity21 , said @entity7 " has wrecked my life " and that he and his wife are " headed for divorce			1
" he also claimed that , by the way , @entity7 faked his devotion to religion to win votes			1
certainly , it was n't the most strategic of office affairs			0
though a recent @entity31 poll reported that it is politicians ' abuse of power , more than their ( increasingly exposed ) extramarital activities , that turns off voters , by hiring a family friend on the taxpayers ' dime and then getting romantic with her at the office , @entity7 seems to have accomplished both			1
but the bigger problem the congressman faces , and what could well lead to his downfall , is hypocrisy			0
people may forgive romantic indiscretions , but it can be harder to make them — or potential opponents — forget religious ones			0
@entity7 , who had no previous political experience , ran on a platform of " faith and family , " touting his 16 - year marriage , five children , and pre-church sunday breakfasts			1
he described himself as a " true conservative " and called on endorsements from family members of @entity61 's popular and extremely socially conservative " @entity60 " — the men among them known for being anti-gay and , as it happens , anti-adultery			2
@entity7 invited @entity64 , the star of the show , to accompany him to the @entity66 in january			1
in at least one campaign ad , he asked voters to pray for him			2
said @entity21 , " he broke out the religious card and he 's about the most nonreligious person i know			0
" but it apparently helped ; he won			0
meanwhile , who is out of a job ? @entity74			2
news reports say that she was " removed from the payroll " within the 24 hours after their embrace was exposed			0
while " there 's no ethics rule that says you ca n't make out with your staffer , " as the @entity87 pointed out , @entity79 rules do require members to " conduct themselves at all times in a manner that reflects creditably on the @entity79 , " and it 's possible @entity7 will face an ethics investigation			1
in 2010 , house speaker @entity91 asked @entity93 rep. @entity92 to resign after @entity92 admitted an affair with a staffer in his district office			1
@entity7 has apologized for the indiscretion , sort of , but said he has no plans to resign			2
in fact , he said , he 'll run for re-election next fall			0
that 's not exactly an act of contrition ; he seems more sorry he was caught than for damaging the public trust			2
though certainly it takes two to tango , as they say — and we do n't yet know details , including how the relationship started , or even if it has stopped — it 's clear @entity7 has different rules for himself than for others			2
and that for a guy with scant political experience , he felt plenty comfortable with using his position ( and his office ) for personal gain			0
if he runs again , at the very least , he might want to rethink that whole " faith , family and hard work " message the next time around .			0

@entity123 : freshman rep. @entity7 caught in video kissing congressional staffer
she says he ran on platform of @entity8 conservatism , family values . @entity131 will hurt him
she says meanwhile staffer is out of job , but @entity7 not resigning
@entity123 : a poll says voters think abuse of power worse than *infidelity* . @entity7 *guilty* of both
