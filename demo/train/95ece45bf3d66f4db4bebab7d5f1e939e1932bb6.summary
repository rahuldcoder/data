-- @entity1 started her career as a stand - up comedian quick to poke fun at herself -- at her body , her family responsibilities and being a misfit within an unaccommodating world			1
by the time she died thursday at 81 , @entity9 had become a worldwide celebrity			2
but she was still a misfit , biting the well - groomed hands that fed her			1
the comedian was quick - witted and sharp - tongued , known for standing on the red carpet or presiding over her show " @entity17 " and , she said , saying the things that other people were thinking			1
rivers , the pioneering , sassy comedian whose gossipy " can we talk " persona led to a career as a headlining talk - show host , best - selling author and red - carpet maven , died a week after being rushed to the hospital after suffering cardiac arrest at a @entity31 clinic			1
" my mother 's greatest joy in life was to make people laugh			2
although that is difficult to do right now , i know her final wish would be that we return to laughing soon , " said her daughter , @entity37 , in a statement			2
@entity1 dies at age 81 @entity9 ' initial rise to fame was propelled by jokes about herself and her family duties			1
" i hate housework , " went one of her jokes			2
" you make the beds , you do the dishes and six months later you have to start all over again			2
" " i blame my mother for my poor sex life , " went another			2
" all she told me was ' the man goes on top and the woman underneath			2
' for three years my husband and i slept in bunk beds			2
" rivers in her own words over time , her self - mocking shtick gave way to more pointed comedy , with shrewd and cutting insults aimed at celebrities and politicians			1
comedians such as @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 and @entity74 owe a great deal to @entity9 ' brash , commanding personality , which was unusual when she first came up			1
" my heart is torn in half , " said @entity72 in a tweet			2
" she was n't done			2
" @entity81 : share your memories of @entity1 she was a popular talk - show guest , most notably on @entity86 's " @entity85 , " and used that platform to become one of @entity86 's regular guest hosts -- and , in 1983 , his permanent guest host			1
but their relationship was severed when , in 1986 , she became the host of her own talk show on @entity96 , then a new television network			1
her show would air opposite the " @entity85			1
" @entity86 , feeling betrayed , cut her off cold			2
she did n't appear on the " @entity85 " again until @entity98 took over as host earlier this year			1
@entity9 ' @entity96 talk show was short - lived and its cancellation coincided with a dark period in her life , including the suicide of her husband - manager , @entity105 , three months after the show was pulled			1
still , the comedian eventually bounced back , first with a daytime talk show , then as co-host with daughter @entity110 's red - carpet coverage			1
the two @entity9 became mainstays of awards season -- later for the @entity114 -- with @entity1 known for mocking celebrities and their outfits there and on the show " @entity17			1
" rivers also became known for her extensive plastic surgery , which -- in typical @entity9 fashion -- she flaunted rather than played down			1
" i 've had so much plastic surgery , when i die they will donate my body to @entity124 , " she said			0
' screaming her way through life ' @entity1 was born june 8 , 1933 , in @entity127 , @entity128 , the daughter of a doctor			1

" @entity1 and @entity105 , pursued by the same ghosts and hurts , feeling mutually threatened by adversaries real and imagined , trusted only each other and existed as an island built from intense and protective loyalty , " wrote the magazine 's @entity174			1
rivers summed up the impact of his death bluntly , of course			1
" all that happened to me , " she told the @entity181 , " was my husband committed suicide , my daughter did n't talk to me for two years , and i was broke			1
" a year after @entity105 's death , she joined the cast of @entity189 's " @entity188			0
" indeed , she often took refuge in work , whether it was writing books , mocking celebrities , starring in @entity194 or even appearing in a documentary about her life , 2010 's " @entity1 : a @entity197			1
" rivers was often a polarizing figure , recognized for her wit but feared for her underlying wrath			1

" seventy percent of the critics have hated my movie , " she told @entity227			0
" the other 30 % were geniuses , knew their work and were sensually attractive			0
" nevertheless , she never directed again			0
' it 's my job to make them laugh ' more recently , her red - carpet quips and " @entity17 " commentary got her attacked as cruel			1
in 2013 , @entity245 noted of @entity9 ' chatter , " they put values in all the things that are wrong and show that it 's ok to just point at people and call them ugly and call them fat and they call it fun			0
