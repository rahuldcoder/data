gunmen stalked through the school , shooting children as they cowered under benches and booby - trapping buildings with homemade explosives			0
when the siege finally ended , @entity7 was left reeling and the world wondering : who would do such a thing ? and what do they hope to achieve ? the identity of the group behind the massacre at the army - run school in @entity18 is no mystery			2
the @entity7 @entity20 -- who have long conducted an insurgency against the @entity7 government as they seek to overthrow the authorities and bring in @entity26 law -- were quick to claim the terror attack			1
and they said it was revenge for the killing of hundreds of innocent tribesmen and their children during a recent offensive by the @entity7 military			1
earlier this year , the government held tentative peace talks with the @entity7 @entity20 -- formally known as @entity37 , or @entity37 -- but it suspended them after two brazen attacks around @entity7 's largest airport in @entity40 in june			1
since then , @entity7 's military has been conducting a ground offensive aimed at clearing out @entity37 and other militants in the loosely governed tribal areas of northwestern @entity7			1
the campaign has displaced tens of thousands of people			0
the @entity7 @entity20 are also against @entity48 - style education for children and the employment of women			1
most famously , their militants shot schoolgirl education activist @entity53 in the head in 2012 as she traveled on a school bus			0
she survived to receive a @entity56 last week			0
the school attacked tuesday , which educates both boys and girls in separate classes , is the main school for the children of army personnel in @entity18 and employs both male and female teachers -- making it a desirable target for the terrorists			0
' terrorist outfit ' the @entity7 @entity20 want to stop the authorities from interfering in the tribal areas but also have an extremist ideological agenda , said @entity70 , international security director for the @entity71 think tank			1
the outlawed @entity74 group is closely affiliated with the @entity20 in @entity75 and its members swear allegiance to the @entity75 group 's leader , @entity78			2
it also has close ideological ties with @entity82			0
" this is a terrorist outfit , it 's not just a group that is seeking control of the tribal area , " @entity70 said			0
and like their bedfellows , the @entity7 @entity20 are vehemently opposed to the @entity89 military presence in the region			1
in addition to vowing to force @entity89 troops out of @entity75 , they claimed responsibility for the failed bombing in 2010 in @entity96 's @entity95 and vowed revenge operations against the @entity89 for the killing of @entity99			0
in 2012 , a @entity37 leader endorsed " external " -- meaning overseas -- operations by the group against @entity89 and @entity103 targets			0
and its late leader , @entity105 , killed last year in a @entity89 drone strike , once vowed to send suicide bombers to the @entity89			0
outrage ' off the charts ' so will the @entity7 @entity20 get what they want from the massacre in @entity18 ? @entity113 national security analyst @entity112 believes it could backfire spectacularly on them			1
the group may have gained a lot of publicity , he said , but this attack on schoolchildren is seen as beyond the pale , and the ripples will be felt through @entity7 politics			2
" if the intent was to get the @entity7 military or the @entity7 government to back down , that is just not going to happen , " he said			1
" i think the level of outrage in @entity7 right now is off the charts			2
" while many @entity7 have in the past either supported the @entity7 @entity20 or backed peace negotiations with them , that attitude is now likely to harden , said @entity112			1
previous attempts to forge a peace with the group in 2004 , 2005 and 2008 fell apart , he said , and the chance of future talks seems slim			2
" the history of doing deals with religious zealots is not good , " he said			0
splits and defections the restive provinces of @entity144 , @entity145 and @entity146 , along the mountainous border with @entity75 , have long been a stronghold for the @entity7 @entity20 and other militant groups , including the @entity151 movement			1
and as the @entity7 military tries to clamp down on the @entity37 , it hits back with attacks			1
last year , choir members and children attending sunday school were among 81 people killed in a suicide bombing at the @entity161 @entity160 of @entity7			2
a splinter group of the @entity7 @entity20 claimed responsibility for the church attack , blaming the @entity89 program of drone strikes in tribal areas of the country			1
" their primary target is the @entity7 state and its military , " @entity169 of the @entity170 , a @entity7 think tank , said of the @entity37 after the @entity40 attacks in june			2
" it resents the fact that ( @entity7 ) has an alliance with the @entity178 , and it wants @entity26 to be imposed in @entity7			2
" in recent months , the group has become increasingly fragmented -- meaning the formation of more militant factions -- and has suffered defections to @entity183			1
at the same time , the @entity7 army has stepped up its military campaign in @entity145 and @entity146			2
' they are interested in killing ' @entity187 , a @entity7 analyst and author of " @entity189 , " told @entity113 that @entity7 needs to rethink its approach to militant groups and whether any form of militancy is tolerated in the country			2
" unless that happens , this bloodshed will continue , " she said			0
however , even the latest attack is unlikely to prompt a major shift in policy , she argued , with some political elements within @entity7 continuing to be sympathetic to the @entity37 regardless			0
with this attack , @entity187 said , the @entity7 @entity20 are trying to " achieve as much bloodshed and as much horror and terror " as they can , arguing it 's revenge for their own families being killed			1
" very clearly , their objective is maximum damage , as many people as they can kill			0
they are not interested in hostages , they are interested in killing , " she said			0
" since they can not access hard targets so easily , they are going after softer targets			0
" analyst @entity70 said this shift in approach by the @entity7 @entity20 was extremely disturbing			1
" to target a school is another dynamic altogether , and especially one that is supported by the military , " he said			0
" it 's a very clear statement of intent			0
they have been battling the military for a long time , now they are trying to visualize the terrorism effectively , as we are seeing with those graphic images that are being beamed around the world			0
" security vacuum obstacles to tackling the @entity7 @entity20 lie in the country 's complex politics , its troubled relationship with @entity75 , and differences over foreign policy between @entity7 's government and its military , said @entity70			1
the @entity7 @entity20 and their counterparts in @entity75 move back and forth across the porous border , sharing resources , cooperating and jointly plotting attacks , said @entity70			1
" there 's no way of trying to challenge that unless you dismantle the infrastructure			0
and this is where the problem lies in @entity7 , " he said			0
" the military will not dismantle the infrastructure for the @entity75 @entity20 , which allows the @entity7 @entity20 to continue to exist			1
" and , he warned , the withdrawal of @entity48 combat troops from @entity75 by the end of this year is likely only to heighten the problem , as the @entity20 step in to fill the resulting security vacuum			1
" the @entity20 have been biding their opportunity , waiting to carry out plots and activities , to try and regain a foothold especially in southern @entity75 , " he said			0
" they will be cooperating with the @entity7 @entity20			1
there is this paradox that is creating this problem			0
you have the @entity7 military sponsoring and supporting the @entity75 @entity20 , ( while ) fighting the @entity7 @entity20 , but both @entity20 cooperate because they have that @entity265 ethnic factor that unites them			1
" recent @entity7 offensives had been believed to have weakened the group , but it is clearly still all too capable of a shocking attack .			2
