-- with more than 5 million people suffering from @entity4 's disease in the @entity5 , a number that 's expected to rise to 16 million by 2050 , the pressure is on to find better methods of diagnosis , treatment and prevention			1
around the world , alzheimer 's disease is the second most feared disease , behind cancer , according to a recent survey of five countries conducted by the @entity17			1
yet there is still a lot of misinformation : only 61 % of @entity5 who responded to the survey correctly identified @entity4 's disease as a fatal illness			1
many participants also mistakenly believe there are sure diagnostic methods and effective treatments to slow the disease , but most would seek medical attention if they became aware of their own early signs			1
the research that came out of the @entity33 on @entity4 , which took place in @entity35 last week , reflects a growing emphasis on early detection			1
research suggests the best targets for exploring treatments are patients who do not have full - blown alzheimer 's disease , but experience mild symptoms			1
scientists have identified biological indicators called biomarkers that seem to be associated with @entity4 's , although they are not perfect predictors			1
@entity33 : 10 signs of @entity4 's " things are heading earlier and earlier			2
and the use of biomarkers has been really essential for helping everybody move toward an understanding of what the earliest changes are and when they can be detected , " said dr. @entity50 , chair of neurology at @entity52			2
early detection so far , no drug has been developed to significantly slow the progression of the disease in all patients			1
and there 's no way to halt or reverse the decline of memory and other cognitive abilities once @entity4 's has been diagnosed			2
since attempts to help patients who already have symptoms in these ways have failed , scientists must look to the earliest stages of @entity4 's in hopes of stopping it before it begins			2
studies presented at the conference reinforced the notion that signs of @entity4 's may develop in the brain 10 to 20 years before any symptoms begin			2
a substance in the brain called beta - amyloid has been associated with dementia in people who have those kinds of symptoms			0
this is the main ingredient of plaques that build up in the brains of @entity4 's patients			2
people with a rare genetic form of @entity4 's , whose specific genetic mutations guarantee that they will develop the disease , tended to show signs of amyloid plaques in pet scans and cerebrospinal fluid 10 to 20 years before the onset of symptoms			1
these results come from the @entity106 project			0
but that represents only a small fraction of @entity4 's patients -- 1 % of cases worldwide , specifically			2
if you do n't have the genetic form , there 's no way to tell if you will go on to develop the disease , even if you have accumulation of amyloid plaques			1
there are some people who have them but do not show symptoms of @entity4 's			2
the kinds of tests that would detect beta - amyloid levels are not widely available			0
and it 's not clear that pulling the amyloid plaques out of the brain reverses the process of cognitive decline ; this is one area of research right now			1
another biomarker of interest is a protein called tau , implicated in the neurofibrillary tangles -- which basically take the shape of cells and destroy them -- that build up in the brains of @entity4 's patients , particularly in the memory center called the hippocampus			2
but there 's no scan to detect these tangles in a living patient			2
a major focus of research on early detection is patients who have mild cognitive impairment , a collection of symptoms involving difficulty with memory , language and other mental functions , but which does not interfere with everyday life			1
it is not necessarily a precursor to alzheimer 's disease , but it does raise the risk of progressing into that more severe illness			1
understanding mild cognitive impairment is important in coming up with better treatments for dementia in general , because the brain has n't deteriorated as much as in @entity4 's , so it may not be too late to intervene , experts say			2
the brain is the primary organ the disease attacks , but a small study presented at the conference suggests the eyes may also reveal signs of @entity4 's			1
researchers looked at photos of retinal blood vessels and found some differences in @entity4 's patients , but further research is needed to confirm this idea of using an eye exam to help diagnose @entity4 's			1
the same holds for a study suggesting that falling is indicative of @entity4 's early stages : it 's a preliminary idea that needs further investigation			1
identifying risk and prevention factors another area of focus is identifying risk factors for @entity4 's disease			1
these are associations , not known direct causes			0
" age is a risk factor we ca n't modify , at least yet			0
our genetics , we ca n't modify yet , which is another major risk factor , " @entity50 said			0
" but certainly seeking clues about ones that are modifiable is an important " research area			0
at the @entity35 conference , researchers said 3 million cases of @entity4 's could be prevented worldwide if lifestyle - based , chronic disease risk factors were reduced by 25 %			1
this estimate is based on a mathematical model			0
in the @entity5 , physical inactivity had the biggest association with @entity4 's out of the risk factors studied , followed by depression and smoking			1
midlife hypertension , midlife obesity , low educational attainment and diabetes are other risk factors			1
" if we can demonstrate that these risk factors can be modified , and that it will lead to lower rates of alzheimer 's disease , the impact could be huge , " @entity50 said			1
people in their 40s and 50s have still got perhaps a couple of decades to modify lifestyle to potentially lower risk , he said			0
there is also growing evidence that head trauma may increase the risk of dementia			0
one study presented at the conference in @entity35 found that traumatic brain injury was associated with dementia among older veterans			0
a study of former @entity242 players suggests that football players also may be at increased risk for mild cognitive impairment or similar cognitive decline , perhaps as a result of repeated head injury during these former athletes ' sports careers			2
in fact , 75 former professional football players are suing the @entity242 , alleging that the league concealed information about the harmful effects of concussions on the brain for decades			0
there is also the idea of cognitive reserve : that keeping the mind active can at least delay the onset of dementia			0
it also seems that intelligence might help the brain stay in the mild phase of the disease longer , although more study needs to be done in this area as well			2
" we know that highly intelligent people have more tolerance to plaque buildup and to loss of energy in their brains than people with lower levels of intelligence and less education , " said dr. @entity271 , vice president and dean of the @entity273 's @entity52 , at an @entity4 's forum at the @entity275 in may			0
" their brain basically fights it off and finds some other ways to get the things done			0
" caregiving one of the underappreciated effects of alzheimer 's disease is how great a toll it takes on caregivers			1
caregivers are much more frequently ill and die earlier than people who do not care for someone with the disease , studies have shown			0
the stress of taking care of someone chronically ill is sometimes called caregiver syndrome			0
caregiving is hazardous to health because of the stress of helping @entity4 's patients , and because caregivers may ignore their own health , @entity271 said			0
" @entity4 's patients , when they get into moderate and severe stages , do n't have some real sense of time , " @entity271 said			0
" they have to be watched every minute			0
" patients may hurt themselves or wander off if not under constant supervision			0
and it 's common for patients to reverse their sleeping and waking cycles , so caregivers ' daily habits are likewise disrupted			0
the cost is staggering : caregivers provide more than $ 200 billion in unpaid care , 17 billion hours each year , according to the @entity33			0
@entity326 ' advice to @entity4 's caregivers : breathe , believe and receive why do n't we know more ? two of the biggest obstacles to finding treatments for alzheimer 's disease are lack of money and difficulty enrolling people in clinical trials , experts say			1
the @entity5 spends $ 450 million each year in @entity4 's research money , compared to $ 6 billion for cancer , $ 4 billion for heart disease and $ 3 billion for hiv / aids research			1
in spite of the money that does exist for research , @entity4 's clinical trials are hard to fill with participants , said dr. r. @entity347 , director of the @entity348			2
sometimes people believe they 're just having " senior moments " and do n't want to acknowledge their illness , @entity347 said			0
in other cases , patients do n't want to go through the hassle of the trial if they 're not guaranteed to receive an experimental drug ; but , in order for a scientific study to be valid , patients must be randomly assigned to either the drug or a placebo			0
also , some trials do n't test drugs at all , but simply look for those biomarkers that may help predict disease later or explore other early diagnostic methods			1
such methods will be in high demand when an effective treatment is developed , @entity271 said			0
" when the first drug is successful , let 's say in symptomatic disease -- may it be so -- the crush to take advantage of what we know , while it 's still in research format now , will be immense , " @entity271 said			1
if you or a loved one are interested in exploring clinical trials , the @entity33 runs a system called @entity383 to assist in finding a trial near you			0
