@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity3 has its share of eye - popping choices : * deep fried kool - aid * @entity7 , a heart - stopping marriage of @entity10 and quarter pounder			2
* and this year , at the 50th annual @entity12 , a have to see it to believe it pairing : former foes @entity16 and @entity18 , all smiles , eager to prove the @entity21 establishment and the tea party can not only coexist , but can be allies			1
it was n't too long ago that @entity25 , a freshman senator , was a thorn in @entity28 's side -- defeating the @entity30 leader 's candidate of choice in the 2010 primary season that helped put the tea party on the map			1
as @entity25 surged late in that campaign , @entity28 cut an ad for his choice , @entity1 's then - secretary of state			1
" i know @entity39 and trust him			0
we need @entity39 's conservative leadership to help turn back the @entity44 agenda , " @entity28 said in the spot			2
fast forward three years , and what you see is an awkward alliance that is in part the product of painful lessons @entity28 has learned in recent years as tea party backed insurgents have knocked off @entity21 establishment figures in primaries , including one of @entity28 's best friends in the @entity56 , @entity54 of @entity57			1
at the @entity3 event , @entity28 delivered a forceful rebuke of president @entity44 's health care plan			2
" the solution to @entity62 is to pull it out root and branch			0
" @entity28 told the breakfast moment 's after @entity1 's @entity68 governor praised the plan			1
@entity28 , though , opposes a tea party backed plan to risk a government shutdown if that is what it takes to deny the president the funding necessary to implement the health care program			1
it is one of the issues highlighted by @entity28 's tea party backed primary opponent , businessman @entity82			1
and one of the issues where @entity85 , as his campaign calls itself , hopes having tea party favorite @entity25 in his corner helps blunt @entity82 's appeal			1
@entity82 lands conservative endorsement " i think it is a dumb idea to shut down the government , " @entity25 said in response to a question from @entity2 as he and @entity28 met with reporters recently at the fair			1
the @entity82 challenge is a case study in @entity98 101			0
the litany of familiar complaints against the establishment rattled off in one early @entity103 ad : " @entity28 has voted for higher taxes , bailouts , debt ceiling increases , congressional pay raises , and liberal judges			1
" @entity82 's chances likely depend on some big outside help , and some of the conservative groups who make their names taking on the @entity21 establishment are dipping their toes into the race now to get a sense of whether @entity28 is truly vulnerable			1
" career @entity121 politician @entity16 claims to be a conservative , " is the opening line of one recent radio ad paid for by the @entity120			0
the @entity1 primary is may 20 , and given the early bruising tone , plus @entity28 's national profile , there is no doubt this contest will shatter state spending records for @entity56 races			1
the matchup here is one of several testing the standing of veteran , establishment @entity21			0
@entity21 sens. @entity139 of @entity141 and @entity142 of @entity143 , for example , are bracing for potentially tough challenges			0
@entity145 is running against incumbent @entity21 sen. @entity146 in @entity147			2
@entity28 's campaign recently released its own polling showing a more than 40 point lead over @entity82			1
but he is running as if scared , mindful of the tea party surprises these past two election cycles			2
@entity28 is already spending on tv ads , painting @entity82 as a political opportunist			1
" @entity157 ' company failed to pay taxes , then got a taxpayer bailout			0
@entity160 , not a @entity1 conservative , " blares one			0
another focuses on a @entity82 resume that appeared to suggest he graduated from @entity164 when , in reality , he participated in a short @entity164 seminar program for which all recipients received a certificate			0
" newspapers say @entity82 was dishonest about his resume -- claiming to graduate from prestigious @entity164 , " this @entity28 ad declares			2
" @entity28 hits opponent over @entity175 profile some see evidence of @entity28 's caution in the @entity180 debate now front and center in @entity182			1
of the four top leaders in @entity182 , @entity28 is alone in not supporting the president 's call for military strikes : @entity21 house speaker @entity186 , @entity188 @entity187 and senate majority leader @entity189 are all on record backing action			1
@entity28 issued a statement tuesday saying he was still undecided			0
" @entity182 and our constituents would all benefit from knowing more about what it is he thinks needs to be done â € ” and can be accomplished â € ” in @entity180 and the region , " the @entity21 leader said after a @entity194 meeting with the president			2
@entity28 aides say his caution has nothing to do with the campaign			0
but @entity82 is on record opposing military strikes against @entity180 , as is @entity25 -- and to take a position at odds with his primary rival and new ally would instantly make the @entity180 debate a campaign flashpoint			1
@entity25 to @entity44 : do n't rush into war in @entity180 @entity68 were already on record promising to make @entity28 a top 2014 target , even though @entity1 has n't elected a @entity217 to the @entity56 since @entity218 won his last six - year term in 1992			1
@entity189 predicts @entity28 loss secretary of state @entity221 is well aware of the history , and using her early months of the campaign to try to make the case she would be no rubber stamp for @entity44			2
" we have had trouble in our state identifying with the @entity230 , " @entity221 said in an interview			0
" i will tell you i am running as a @entity1			0
... i have my disagreements with the president			0
" chief among them , she says , is an energy policy she called anti-coal			0
@entity221 also favors changes to the health care law , but says it has many admirable pieces that should be kept			0
she is campaigning , at least for now , as someone who expects @entity28 to survive the primary challenge			2
" it 's about ending the disease of dysfunction that we have seen in @entity121 , " she says of her campaign			0
" and after nearly 30 years , senator @entity28 is at the center of it			0
he is to blame for the failed leadership			0
" @entity28 's team labels @entity221 as too liberal for the state and suggests the president 's standing here would be a major drag			1
but the incumbent himself prefers not to deliver direct blows , just yet , leaving that , for the most part , to his team and tv ads. " i like a good campaign , " @entity28 said after the fair breakfast			2
" we are going to have a lot of fun			0
