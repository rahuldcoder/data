the main " downs " of buying a used car are that it 's a used car , not new -- so there 's no new car warranty and you are more vulnerable to used car problems that could cost you money , as well as aggravation			1
to reduce your risk of exposure when you buy a used car , there are a number of precautionary steps you can take when shopping for a used vehicle			2
these tips to buy a used car include : shop for newer used cars that still have at least a portion of their original manufacturer 's warranty remaining : most late model used cars have at least three - year / 36,000 mile basic warranty coverage ( and often longer " powertrain " coverage on the engine and transmission )			1
this means you 'll get at least a year or so of peace of mind if you buy a used car that is less than three years old			2
( @entity41 : be sure to confirm the used car warranty is fully transferable			1
) check into @entity43 , pre-owned ( @entity44 ) vehicles : these are late model used cars and trucks that typically have less than 50,000 miles and have been given multipoint inspections -- with any needed service or upkeep taken care of before the used car is put on the lot			1
@entity44 programs are backed by the automakers ( @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 , etc. ) and the vehicles often include a no - cost extended warranty on major parts such as the engine and transmission			1
@entity44 used cars are usually clean and well - maintained -- the " cream puffs " of the used car market			1
do a " background check " for indications that the particular used car make / model you are considering might be a problem car : one with an unusual record of either recalls or consumer complaints			2
you can find information about recalls and safety - related defects at the @entity83 's web site ( www.nhtsa.dot.gov ) , and information about consumer satisfaction at @entity87 ( see www.jdpower.com/cc/index.jsp )			1
@entity89 is another good place to poke around ( go to www.consumerreports.org/main/home.jsp and click on " autos " )			0
it 's also a very good idea to do a simple @entity94 or @entity95 web search ; just type in the make and model of the vehicle and " lemon			2
" you can bet if the car has a history of problems , there will be complaints all over the @entity106			2
screen your candidate -- the specific used car you are looking at : even if the make / model has a great reputation for quality and reliability , that particular used car may not have been well - maintained -- even abused			1
have a third - party mechanic ( not one working for the dealer ) look the used car over as a condition of sale			1
if the dealer refuses to permit this , you should consider yourself well warned -- and walk away			0
ask to see the used cars ' service records : if these are available , it 's usually a good sign the car was well cared - for , and perhaps more importantly , proof ( if the records are complete ) that there were n't any unusual repairs or problems			1
if the used car records are not available , you should be suspicious			2
it does n't necessarily mean the used car is a bad car , but you have to wonder why the seller would not have kept such a strong selling point as evidence of proper upkeep and maintenance			0
in such a case , it is doubly important to have a mechanic you trust give the used car a thorough once - over before you commit to buy			1
be sure it will pass both state safety and emissions tests ( where applicable ) : in most states , this is a legal requirement , but do n't assume it is			1
it can cost hundred of dollars ( or more ) to repair a used car that fails either state safety or vehicle emissions testing -- and in many cases , you ca n't legally register or drive that used car until it does pass			1
lastly , jot down the @entity162 ( @entity162 ) : located on a stamped plate on the top of the used cars dashboard , and run a @entity167 report to check for used car deal - killers such as evidence of a prior accident , odometer fraud , manufacturer " buy back " ( a lemon ) and so on			1
a @entity167 report costs less than $ 25 , and is well worth the expense			0
as far as specific recommendations , here 's a short list of some historically " good bets " when it comes to buying used cars or trucks : @entity183 : @entity184 -- the gold standard of new economy cars is also , predictably , an excellent choice in a used car			1
in addition to a well - earned reputation for high quality and durability , corollas are among the safest cars in this class -- and offer features such as antilock brakes and side - impact air bags ( on newer models )			1
corollas also hold their value exceptionally well -- to such an extent that a used corolla you buy today for $ 6,000 will very likely still be worth four or five thousand dollars two to three years down the road			0
@entity206 : @entity207 / @entity207 -- @entity208 , these large rear - drive , v - 8 powered luxury sedans cost tens of thousands less than an equivalent @entity212 , @entity213 or @entity214			0
as used cars , they continue to perform flawlessly -- without giving their owners high blood pressure years after other luxury makes become expensive money pits			0
the ls series sedans are considered bulletproof -- and also have one of the lowest depreciation rates in the business			0
@entity226 -- a conservatively elegant large luxury car that , like the @entity207 , enjoys a reputation for absolutely superb engineering and quality			0
unlike the @entity207 , however , the @entity226 is a front - wheel - drive luxury sedan -- so it offers better grip in the winter , if that 's a concern where you live			2
and it is powered by a v - 6 engine rather than a large v - 8 , so its appetite for gas is more agreeable			0
@entity241 : @entity243 / @entity242 -- these six - passenger sedans are hugely roomy and immensely rugged ( one reason they 're favored as police cars / taxis / limos ) and very safe -- consistent @entity251 performers in government / insurance industry crash testing			2
these are also the only late model sedans that offer standard v - 8 power and rear - wheel - drive in a full - size chassis for the price of a v - 6 powered , front - drive , midsize sedan			0
iv. pickups : @entity262 -- tough , capable and exceptionally trouble - free small pickups , the @entity262 offers both economical but tough 4 - cylinder engines and more powerful @entity266 engines			0
look for used 4x4 models with manual locking hubs			0
though it requires the driver to stop the vehicle , get out and manually engage the front hubs by rotating a knob in the center of each front wheel , these 4x4 systems tend to be more durable and problem - free in the long haul than the electronic / automatic hubs used on most new pickups			0
@entity280 : @entity281 -- considered by serious off - road drivers to be one of the best vehicles for this job ( due to its agility , suspension and comparatively narrow body ) , the @entity281 consistently scores well when it comes to long - term durability and used car resale value , too			1
minivans : @entity293 -- though pricey relative to other vans , the @entity293 is considered the benchmark vehicle in this class -- for features as well as overall design			0
excellent used car resale value and top of its class occupant protection are additional reasons to consider an @entity293			0
@entity304 -- another @entity184 product that 's got an established track record for high quality and a low incidence of significant problems , defect or recalls			0
siennas are offered in a variety of configurations , including models with full - time all - wheel - drive ( @entity316 ) .			0
