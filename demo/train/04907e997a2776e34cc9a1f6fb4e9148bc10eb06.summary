-- @entity2 rep. @entity1 is making his third bid for the @entity4 armed with the same libertarian - leaning stances that cultivated a dedicated following during his 11 terms in the @entity8			1
those positions -- calls for limited government , reduced federal spending and less @entity14 involvement overseas -- are now in the fore of national politics with the rise of the @entity18 and the country 's financial situation			2
@entity1 is perhaps most famous for his calls to abolish the @entity23 and @entity24 and return to a gold standard , views he often advocates as a member of the @entity27			1
and as a member of the @entity29 , he has consistently voted against authorizing military action overseas and opposed @entity14 support for the @entity32 and the @entity33			2
he has also called for constitutional amendments to abolish personal income , estate and gift taxes			0
but those are some of the same issues that made him and his son , @entity42 sen. @entity41 , darlings of the @entity18 movement and especially popular among young conservatives whom he visits on college campuses across the country			0
he often says he was fighting for those issues before they were popular			0
more @entity1 coverage on the @entity50 " @entity51 is now thinking about these things			1
before , mainstream was deficits do n't matter , print money when you need it , endless wars , personal privacy that did n't mean anything , " @entity1 said on @entity0 's " @entity53 " recently			1
" but believe me , mainstream is moving in the direction that i have been talking about for a long time , and therefore nobody knows what the outcome will be in this election			0
" although he raises significant campaign funds , fundraising success does n't necessarily translate to electoral wins			0
while running for the 2008 @entity71 nomination , @entity1 raised $ 20 million in the last quarter of 2007 , mostly through individual contributions , which was twice as much raised by eventual @entity71 nominee sen. @entity73 of @entity74			1
but he barely breached 10 % in the early presidential voting states			2
after he dropped out of the race in june 2008 , he used his remaining funds to form @entity78 , designed to support candidates who agreed with his policy stances			2
an early champion of virtual campaigning , @entity1 coined the term " money bomb " for setting a fundraising goal over a set period of time on his website			1
he raised more than $ 1 million during his most recent " money bomb " in june but fell short of the $ 2 million goal			0
the @entity91 native first ran for the @entity4 in 1988 as the @entity93 candidate against @entity71 @entity94 and democrat @entity95 , ultimately receiving 0.5 percent of the vote , or 432,000 votes , in the general election			1
but do n't expect him to seek a third - party bid in 2012			0
" we do n't have a democracy in this country			0
it 's so biased , " @entity1 told @entity0 chief political correspondent @entity103			1
" if you 're a third party , you ca n't -- i ca n't get into debates as a third - party candidate			2
when i did it as a third party , i spent over half my money just to get on the ballot			0
" as a @entity71 candidate he will also promote more socially conservative stances , popular with @entity71 voters in many of the early nominating states			1
he has said he believes marriage is the union between a man and a woman , but voted in 2004 and 2006 against a proposed constitutional amendment to ban same - sex marriage , something he said is an increase in federal power			0
@entity1 also told @entity126 in may that he supports the " protection of all human life			1
" " i 'm for repealing @entity129			0
and it 's not an attack on women 's rights , " @entity1 said on @entity0 's " @entity130			1
" " women have rights , but they also have a responsibility if they 're responsible for life			0
" @entity1 has a unique perspective as a specialist in obstetrics / gynecology who has delivered more than 4,000 babies			1
after graduating from @entity142 and the @entity143 , he served as a flight surgeon in the @entity145 before moving to @entity2 with his wife @entity146 and eventually representing the 14th district that includes the cities of @entity149 and @entity150			0
he will be 77 in 2012 , but @entity1 , a father of five and grandfather of 18 , said he does n't feel old			1
" where do i get my energy and where do i get my support and the enthusiasm ? it comes from the young people , " @entity1 told @entity126			1
" that really excites me because this issue is so important			0
it 's important to my kids			2
it 's an important point to all the kids of @entity14			2

this will be rep. @entity1 's third presidential run
@entity1 ran as the @entity93 's candidate in 1988 and for the @entity71 nomination in 2008
@entity1 is serving his 11th term in the @entity8
