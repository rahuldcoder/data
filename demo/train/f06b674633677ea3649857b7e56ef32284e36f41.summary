they give an indication of how investors will react when regular - hours @entity9 trading begins at 9:30 a.m. et monday			1
besides the @entity9 downgrade , investors are concerned about the debt crisis in some @entity41 nations , though actions on the part of the @entity44 and the @entity45 sunday helped to allay some of those fears			1
financial representatives of leading industrial nations said they are committed to taking " all necessary measures to support financial stability and growth in a spirit of close cooperation and confidence			1
" they welcomed the " decisive actions taken in the @entity9 and @entity41 " and " the additional policy measures announced by @entity57 and @entity58 to strengthen fiscal discipline and underpin the recovery in economic activity and job creation			1
" " we are committed to taking coordinated action where needed , to ensuring liquidity , and to supporting financial market functioning , financial stability and economic growth , " @entity44 finance ministers and central bank governors said in a sunday night statement			1
treasury secretary @entity71 had been expected to take part in a conference call with representatives of the other @entity44 nations to discuss the downgraded @entity9 credit rating , a @entity44 official told @entity0			1
the @entity44 nations are the @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity57 , @entity81 , @entity82 and the @entity9			1
similarly , the @entity45 made a bid to calm markets sunday			0
it said it would implement a bond - purchase program and welcomed announcements by @entity57 and @entity58 on new measures meant to reduce their deficits			2
it told the governments of those countries that a " decisive and swift implementation " of reforms is " essential			0
" the move represents an escalation in the official response to @entity41 's debt crisis , which is now more than a year old and until recently was contained to smaller economies like @entity98 , @entity99 and @entity100			1
@entity102 managing director @entity101 cheered the announcements			0
" i welcome the statements from the @entity45 , from the leaders of @entity80 and @entity79 as well as from the @entity44 , and their renewed commitment to take all necessary action in a coordinated way to ensure stability and liquidity in the financial markets			1
this cooperation will contribute to maintaining confidence and spurring global economic growth , " she said in a statement			0

@entity120 's market temporarily halted trading at one point and finished down more than 6 % , while the @entity123 fell 3.7 %			1
the @entity124 on the @entity125 was down more than 2.5 % , while in @entity127 , the @entity126 dropped nearly 5.5 % in trading saturday			2
@entity9 officials are talking to a " wide range of investors " about the downgrade by the credit agency to try to " mitigate " any short - term negative impact from friday 's announcement , a @entity130 official told @entity0			1
@entity139 's officials said sunday that the downgraded credit rating for the @entity9 was both a call for political consensus on significant deficit reduction and a warning of possible further credit problems down the road			2
" we have a negative outlook on the rating and that means that we think the risks currently on the rating are to the downside , " said @entity147 , the @entity7 global head of sovereign ratings , on " @entity150			0
" however , @entity157 said markets were reacting to the debt crises in some @entity41 countries and fears of a global economic slump , rather than the @entity9 credit downgrade alone			1
@entity164 , the @entity7 head of sovereign ratings , told @entity167 's " @entity168 " program saturday that it could take years for the @entity9 to return to @entity170 status			2
" well , if history is a guide , it could take a while , " @entity171 said			0
" we 've had five governments that lost their aaa that got it back			0
the amount of time that it took for those five range from nine years to 18 years , so it takes a while			0
" the agency 's concerns " are centered on the political side and on the fiscal side , " @entity171 said			0
" so it would take a stabilization of the debt as a share of the economy and eventual decline , " he said			0
" and it would take , i think , more ability to reach consensus in @entity197 than what we 're observing now			0
" both @entity147 and @entity200 , chairman and chief investment officer at @entity202 , told the @entity150 program that they do n't expect the @entity9 downgrade to cause a spike in interest rates , one of the possible results of the higher risk now attached to @entity9 debt			1
" i do n't think we 'll pay more in interest , " @entity200 said , calling the downgrade more of a symbolic event than an economic event			0
however , he warned of continuing market volatility in coming days driven by uncertainty			0
rating agencies such as @entity7 , @entity219 's and @entity220 analyze risk and give debt a grade that is supposed to reflect the borrower 's ability to repay its loans			0
the safest bets are stamped @entity170			0
that 's where the @entity9 debt has stood for years			1
@entity219 's first assigned the @entity9 an aaa rating in 1917			2
@entity220 and @entity219 's , the other two main credit ratings agencies , maintained the @entity170 rating for the @entity9 after last week 's debt deal , though @entity219 's lowered its outlook on @entity9 debt to " negative			1
" a negative outlook indicates the possibility that @entity219 's could downgrade the country 's sovereign credit rating within a year or two			0
@entity130 officials received @entity7 's analysis friday afternoon and alerted the agency to an error that inflated @entity9 deficits by $ 2 trillion , said an administration official , who was not authorized to speak for attribution			2
the agency acknowledged the mistake , but said it was sticking with its decision			0
the administration official called it " a facts - be - damned decision ... their analysis was way off , but they would n't budge			0
" saturday , @entity257 , director of @entity259 's @entity258 , criticized @entity7 's call			0
" the magnitude of their error and the amateurism it displayed , combined with their willingness to simply change on the spot their lead rationale in their press release once the error was pointed out , was breathtaking			0
it smacked of an institution starting with a conclusion and shaping any arguments to fit it , " he said			0
but @entity147 defended his agency 's move on sunday , telling the @entity150 program : " the underlying debt burden of the @entity9 government is rising and will continue to rise over the next decade			1
" @entity0 's @entity283 , @entity284 and @entity285 contributed to this report .			0

losses are modest in @entity12 , @entity289 , @entity290 and @entity21
investors are weighing both the downgrade and the @entity41 debt crisis
@entity44 leaders say they are committed to taking " all necessary measures "
