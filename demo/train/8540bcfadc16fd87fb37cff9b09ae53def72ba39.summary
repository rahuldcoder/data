ever wondered how to drive from the center of @entity1 , the showcase capital of @entity3 , to @entity4 , the location of the secretive regime 's main nuclear complex ? well , a recent update to @entity9 has the answer for you			1
it has filled in the big , largely blank space that previously lay north of the well - mapped @entity14 with streets , towns and landmarks			0
users curious to virtually explore one of the world 's most reclusive states can zoom into the heart of @entity1 and pull up photographs of the @entity24 , which houses the bodies of the revered former leaders @entity27 and @entity28			0
the availability of photos quickly thins as users scroll into the @entity3 countryside and dries up almost entirely around more controversial areas marked on the map , like the @entity4 nuclear complex and what @entity9 labels the @entity37 and @entity38 gulags			1
human rights groups say as many as 200,000 people may be being held in @entity3 's network of political prison camps			0
the @entity43 , where the regime may be about to carry out a new nuclear test in defiance of international pressure , does n't appear to be featured on the map at the moment			0
' a community of citizen cartographers ' in a blog post monday announcing the update , @entity9 said that @entity3 had been one of the largest places with limited map data in the world			1
unsurprisingly , the details added to the map did n't come from the young @entity3 leader @entity60 's regime			1
@entity9 said " a community of citizen cartographers " used the internet search giant 's @entity63 software over a period of years to pinpoint road and place names			1
@entity63 works in a similar way to @entity71 , allowing users to add , edit and review information			0
the company encouraged people to keep working on the maps , saying , " creating maps is a crucial first step towards helping people access more information about parts of the world that are unfamiliar to them			0
" it said the @entity3 maps could be particularly useful to @entity14 citizens , " who have ancestral connections or still have family living there			0
" restrictions inside but people inside @entity3 , where the @entity93 is extremely restricted , are unlikely to be able to see the mapping information @entity9 is making available			2
the company 's executive chairman , @entity95 , visited @entity3 earlier this month along with former @entity98 gov. @entity97 in a trip that left many observers puzzled			1
@entity95 , who has in the past written at length about the @entity104 's ability to empower citizens oppressed by autocratic governments , urged @entity3 to embrace the @entity93 or face further decline in its impoverished economy			2
@entity95 's daughter @entity109 , who accompanied him on the trip , said in blog post about the visit that they had been able to take a look at @entity3 's national intranet , which she described as " a walled garden of scrubbed content taken from the real @entity93			2

@entity9 *publishes* detailed maps of @entity3 for the first time
it says " citizen cartographers " used map making software to add the data
the maps show the reclusive regime 's main nuclear complex and gulags
