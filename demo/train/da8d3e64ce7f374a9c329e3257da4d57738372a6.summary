a hitchhiking feline in @entity2 has a 50 - year - old truck owner to thank for her unusual rescue			1
@entity5 of @entity6 was n't quite sure what to do at first when he heard purring coming from his @entity10 pickup , parked outside his house in late may			1
he could n't see anything and was n't sure exactly where it was , or even what type of animal was in there			1
so , he left an open can of cat food under one of the tires and set up a camera to try to get to the bottom of it			2
when he came back the next morning , the food was gone , but there was nothing on the video , he said			0
thinking he had lost his mind , he went on an impromptu fishing trip to clear his head			0
when he got to the canal , the purring started again			1
taking matters into his own hands , he reached for his toolbox , took out some sheet metal cutters and cut back the metal on the side of the truck bed			1
as he peeled it back , he spotted a kitten			0
" i seen this little rascal peeking at me , " @entity5 recalled			0
" i said , ' what in the world ? you hitched a ride ! ' " @entity5 had n't thought anything of slicing into his truck			1
he and his wife , @entity50 , have a dog and two cats , and care deeply about animals			0
in the past , @entity5 said , he has rescued stray kittens and brought them to the local @entity55			1
@entity5 could see that the cat was under the bed of his truck , lodged in the frame , and he could n't get to it			1
unsure what to do , he sought advice from the @entity55 of @entity6 and @entity63			1
driving slowly , avoiding any bumps in the road , he reached the society 's animal shelter and approached a staff member			1
" i said , ' @entity70 , there 's a kitten that hitchhiked from my home and i ca n't get it , " " @entity5 said			2
" she said , ' man , you did a job on your truck			1
' " it was a team rescue			0
@entity55 staff member @entity79 got under @entity5 's truck to try to move the kitten forward , while staff member @entity82 put on gloves to catch the kitty and animal care supervisor @entity86 stood ready with a special carrier , said @entity88 , director of education at the local @entity55 , who posted the story on @entity90			1
the shelter , which estimates the kitten was about 8 weeks old , named her @entity92			0
a week after the rescue , the shelter invited @entity5 for a reunion			0
the kitten purred in his arms			0
he took it as a sign			0
" it was almost telling me , ' thank you for saving my life , ' " he said			0
the cat has since been adopted by a family with two teenage girls , adoption counselor @entity105 said			0
after @entity88 shared the story of the rescue on the shelter 's @entity110 page this week , several people offered to help pay for the cost to repair @entity5 's vehicle			1
on friday , the @entity55 set up a special " kitty truck fund " to help @entity5			1
@entity88 said they did n't yet have an estimate for the repairs and any extra money would go into a special emergency fund in @entity5 's name to help other animals in similar situations			2
@entity5 's wife , @entity50 , said they were touched by the outpouring of support			2
the truck is their only vehicle			2
she said it did n't cross their mind to look into repairing it because she knew they could n't afford it			0
both have disabilities ; @entity5 has macular degeneration , but still has the ability to drive during the day			0
on friday , the couple said they were n't worried about the truck and hoped people would just donate to the humane society to help other animals			2
" we really never expected all of this , to be honest , but @entity151 does blessings every day , " @entity148 said			0
" that 's the reason that little kitten just showed up here -- because @entity151 knew we would do whatever we needed to do to make sure that kitten was safe			2
" share your comments below , on @entity159 or on @entity161 's @entity110 page !			2
