-- as @entity3 approaches , @entity2 activists are uniting to voice the message they 've been honing for more than a year : it 's time to reduce the size of government , honor the @entity8 and return to fiscal responsibility in @entity10			1
the @entity12 ' third cross-country tour brings activists to @entity14 , @entity15 , on wednesday , before culminating with an anti-tax rally at the nation 's capital on thursday			1
the " just vote them out ! " tour has weaved through areas represented by vulnerable @entity21 , bringing thousands to senate majority leader @entity23 's hometown in @entity24 on its opening day			0
the tour 's other top target -- @entity21 rep. @entity29 of @entity30 -- announced his retirement the same day the tour was in his turf			0
@entity2 favorite @entity34 was the top draw at the @entity14 event			1
@entity38 sen. @entity37 , whose winning @entity15 campaign was infused by the @entity2 , turned down his invitation to the event , although his office said he wished the rally success			1
are you at a @entity2 rally ? share your images so far , the movement 's success is in the eye of the beholder			1
@entity2 activists running for office have yet to make much impact in the @entity38 primaries , and @entity29 rejected the notion that the @entity2 played a role in his decision to step down			1
@entity2 changes tone , not outcome of @entity60 primary but @entity62 majority leader @entity61 admitted tuesday that the protests and rallies by the @entity2 across the country are having an impact on lawmakers ' decisions about running for another term			1
" do i think that negative atmosphere that 's been created by the @entity2 and by others certainly goes into the thinking of members ? i think it does			2
i think you honestly have to point out that it does , " @entity61 said			2
@entity61 : @entity2 having an impact the @entity2 developed last year in protest to what its supporters saw as overspending in @entity10 -- by @entity38 and @entity21 -- following the stimulus bill , the bank bailouts and president @entity84 's budget			1
fueled by anger at the government and fear of where the country was headed , it grew from dozens to hundreds of loosely linked groups			0
until recently , there had been little movement toward coalescing as a formal party			0
last week , a broad coalition of national and regional @entity2 groups announced the formation of the @entity97			2
@entity2 movement attempts to unite ? @entity99 , a professor of political science at @entity101 , said while @entity2 activists have affected the national agenda , the larger impact has been on the @entity38			1
" it 's energized the hardcore base of republicans who tend to share a lot of @entity2 ideas , but on the other hand , it 's going to bring to the floor a split that has been in the @entity38 for quite a long time , " @entity99 said			1
that split pits the more conservative elements of the party against moderate @entity38			2
at the @entity119 last weekend , a @entity2 member voiced a concern to former @entity122 sen. @entity121 that the moderate @entity38 -- and not conservatives -- would end up on the ballot in november			1
" go beat them , " he told the attendee			0
" that 's what elections are all about			0
i encourage candidates to run , " @entity121 said , adding the @entity38 must focus its energy on electing conservative candidates in the @entity38 primaries			2
rep. @entity134 , @entity135 , said last week that the @entity38 and the @entity2 are in the process of merging			1
@entity134 : @entity38 and @entity2 movement are ' merging ' if the @entity2 pushes @entity38 further to the right , however , it could hurt them in november , @entity99 noted			1
centrist voters would likely favor a @entity141 over a far - right @entity38 , he said			2
@entity142 @entity143 gov. @entity142 pleaded with conservatives at the conference to stick together as the elections near			0
" the @entity21 ' fondest hope is to see @entity2 or other conservatives split off and have a third party to split the conservative vote , " he said			2
" we ca n't let that happen			0
we 've got to stay unified			0
" @entity99 said the @entity38 now finds itself trying to navigate the movement			2
" they want to incorporate it to the degree they can without hurting the party 's chances , " he said			0
as for @entity2 members , they want to hold lawmakers ' feet to the fire without being swallowed up by a party some fear is trying to @entity167 their grassroots movement			1
" i got more knife wounds in my back from @entity38 operatives than @entity21 could ever do , " said @entity169 , chairman of the @entity170			1
" the democrats at least stand there and tell me they hate me , and tell me that they hate @entity176			0
these republicans smile at me , shake my hand and then stab me in the back			0
" the @entity12 is run from the same building as a @entity38 political consulting firm			1
@entity182 , who coordinates the @entity12 , told @entity0 earlier this year that the people who run the movement " need a major political party			2
" " i think what you 'll find is at @entity2 rallies , a lot of those people who are mad at the @entity38 , many of them are @entity38 themselves			1
us included , " he said			0
a @entity193 poll conducted earlier this year indicates @entity2 activists would vote overwhelmingly @entity38 in a two - party race for @entity197			1
the poll also found that activists in the @entity2 movement tend to be male , upscale and overwhelmingly conservative			2
roughly 11 percent of all @entity176 say they have actively supported the @entity2 movement			2
of this core group of activists , half live in rural areas			0
" it seems to have captured the attention of a certain , very large and important segment , but still -- a certain segment of society , " @entity99 said			0
" its lasting power is someone questionable			0
" what remains to be seen is how closely the movement allies itself with the @entity38 , to what extent the various @entity2 groups come together as a formal organization and whether the activists solidify around a more coherent message removed from vitriolic embellishments and not grounded in fear , @entity99 said			1
" what will happen to them if the economy improves ? what will happen to them if the health care plan starts to work ? what happens to this extreme message if things turn in ways that no longer enflame all of these doubts many people have about who they are as @entity176 , but starts to reassure them that @entity176 is moving in a better direction ? " he asked			0
but at least for now , the movement 's focus remains on cleaning house , @entity169 said			0
" we 're in a war for the soul of this country , " he said			1
" we need to purge both parties			0
we need to purge the @entity21 of the @entity245 and the @entity38 of the weaklings			0
" @entity0 's @entity247 , @entity248 , @entity249 and @entity250 contributed to this report .			0
