@entity1 gov. @entity0 again insisted he has n't yet decided whether to run for president , but his family wo n't be able to veto him if he does decide to jump in the race			1
he added , however , what his family thinks about the prospect " matters deeply to me			0
" " and just as importantly , what the potential impact would be on each and every one of them is something that weighs enormously on me , " he said during his monthly " ask the governor " radio show			0
could @entity0 be bullied out of 2016 ? the @entity1 governor said that " just this morning as i was getting ready for work " he was thinking about how his youngest daughter , 11 - year - old @entity15 , would be affected by a run			1
@entity18 said he 's asking himself three questions : " is it right for me , is it right for my family , is it right for the country â € ” Â in that order			1
" " i 'll decide , " on the answer to those questions , he said , " and then after that i 'll make the decision about when to let everyone know			2
" @entity18 has repeatedly said he has n't made up his mind on 2016 , but has made no secret of his interest and his supporters are moving to build the operation he 'll need if he does decide to jump in the race			1
allies of the governor are in the early stages of starting a leadership political action committee that would serve as an apparatus for him to travel and to hire staff , @entity2 confirmed earlier this month			0
during his thursday evening radio show appearance , @entity18 would n't confirm that those plans were underway			1
" there 's lots of people making lots of suggestions to me ... there 's a whole bunch of different options on the table , but i have n't made any final decision about what to do , " he said			2
' @entity18 previews presidential road map with former @entity62 gov. @entity61 announcing last month plans to " actively explore " a run , and 2012 @entity64 nominee @entity63 telling donors and supporters he 's seriously considering it , @entity18 's path to the nomination looks to have narrowed , as both @entity61 and @entity63 would vie for the same universe of establishment - minded donors and voters as @entity18			1
but @entity18 made clear that the rest of the field will have no bearing on his eventual decision			1
" ' i 'm not gon na allow other people to dictate to me my time frame , " he said			0
@entity18 has said before that running against @entity61 would be " stressful " because " you do n't like to run against people who are your friends			1
" the @entity1 governor helped raise money for @entity84 's 2000 bid , and @entity61 later appointed him @entity86 attorney for @entity1			2
but @entity18 said on thursday night he felt even if the two ran against each other , " i do n't think that means it has to end a relationship			2
" " friends have run against each other before though ... it 's just the way it goes , " he said			0
" if @entity61 decides ultimately to run and i decide ultimately to run â € ” i hope that what we could do is to run based upon our particular visions for the country and for our party , and may the best person win			0
" indeed , @entity18 invited the wide - open primary fight that 's developing , arguing that " if it 's a smart , respectful , substantive debate , that 's good for the party			0
" " to the extent that it becomes difficult and divisive , it depends on how those people who are on the receiving end of that deals with it , " he said .			0
