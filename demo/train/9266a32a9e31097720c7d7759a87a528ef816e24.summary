@entity0 -- @entity3 's government in @entity4 continues to repress civil rights and persecute dissenters three years after he became the communist nation 's top leader , @entity9 says in a report released wednesday			1
@entity3 took over in july 2006 , when older brother @entity11 became ill and was no longer able to rule after more than 47 years in charge			1
the new dictator has locked up scores of people and allowed scores more that had been jailed by @entity17 to remain behind bars , @entity9 says			2
" rather than dismantle @entity4 's repressive machinery , @entity3 has kept it firmly in place and fully active , " the report says			1
@entity24 government officials in @entity0 rejected the conclusions reached in the report , titled " @entity27 , @entity4			1
" " @entity4 does not recognize the legality nor the moral authority of @entity9 as an organization that defends human rights , " said @entity28 , spokesman for @entity4 's diplomatic office in @entity0			1
" @entity9 is an organization that analyzes this topic in a discriminatory , selective and above all politicized way			0
its evaluation of human rights in @entity4 is illegitimate and illegal			1
" critics of the @entity24 government agree with the rights group 's conclusion that nothing has changed despite the new leadership			0
" everyone thought there would be change , but there is no change , " said @entity44 , head of the @entity46 group in @entity47			0
some analysts even see a reversal in human rights			0
" while there has been some economic reforms and political openings under @entity3 , the human rights picture has worsened			1
there is a greater police presence on the streets , " said @entity60 , whose book " without @entity11 : a @entity65 in @entity66 , @entity67 , and @entity0 " was published last month			1
" @entity3 's inner circle have unbridled contempt for the dissidents , " @entity60 told @entity1			1
@entity3 has relied on a law dealing with " dangerousness " to foster much of the repression , @entity9 said			1
" @entity79 " allows authorities to jail people before they have committed any crime , on the suspicion that they are likely to commit an offense			1
" in his three years in power , @entity3 has been just as brutal as his brother , " said @entity80 , @entity81 director at @entity9			1
" @entity24 who dare to criticize the government live in perpetual fear , knowing they could wind up in prison for merely expressing their views			0
" the report is based on 60 extensive interviews @entity9 researchers conducted in june and july in seven of @entity4 's 14 provinces and by telephone from @entity94			1
the research uncovered more than 40 cases in which @entity4 jailed citizens under the " dangerousness " provision			2
the government also uses other harsh laws to silence free speech , quash labor rights and criminalize all forms of association , the report says			0
human rights violations include abusive interrogations , the denial of legal counsel and sham trials , the report says			0
in addition , the report says , " political prisoners are subjected to widespread abuses , including forced ideological re-education , extended solitary confinement and the denial of medical treatment for serious illnesses			2
" @entity4 also enforces political conformity through beatings , short - term detention , public acts of repudiation and the denial of work , @entity9 says			1
" taken together , these everyday forms of repression create a climate of fear that has a profound chilling effect on the exercise of fundamental freedoms in @entity24 society , " the report says			0
@entity9 urges the @entity137 to dismantle a trade embargo it has imposed on @entity4 since 1962			2
the embargo , the group said , has proven a costly and misguided failure			0
" the embargo has inflicted severe hardship on the @entity24 population as a whole , while doing nothing to improve the human rights situation in @entity4 , " the rights group says			2
" rather than isolating @entity4 , the policy has isolated the @entity137 , alienating @entity0 's potential allies on this issue			2
" in place of the embargo , @entity9 recommends that the @entity137 obtain commitments from the @entity155 , @entity156 and @entity158 allies to push @entity4 to meet one demand : the immediate and unconditional release of all political prisoners within six months			1
" if the @entity3 government does not meet this demand , " the rights group says , " members of the multilateral coalition should impose targeted , punitive measures , such as travel bans on government officials or withholding new forms of foreign investment			2
these measures should be significant enough to bear real consequences for the @entity24 government , while being careful not to impose suffering on the @entity24 population as a whole			0
" the report came one day after the release of poll results by another group showing 82 percent of @entity24 do not believe matters are going well on the island			0
in the survey , sponsored by the non-partisan @entity183 , 52 percent of @entity24 who responded cited economic issues as their greatest concern and 66 percent said they do not believe the government will solve the nation 's most pressing issues			0
" the data reveals @entity24 ' strong dissatisfaction toward its leadership and their indisputable preferences for political and economic change , " the institute 's president , @entity193 , says in a news release			0
the poll , undertaken july 1 - august 4 in 12 @entity24 provinces , asked the opinions of 432 @entity24 adults , the institute said			0
the results have a sampling error of plus or minus 5 percentage points			0
@entity1 's @entity209 in @entity0 and @entity210 in @entity211 contributed to this report .			0

the report , titled " @entity215 , @entity4 " says @entity3 has been " just as brutal as his brother @entity11 "
@entity4 accused of jailing people before they have committed any crime , on suspicion they are likely to commit an offense
says regime also enforces political conformity through beatings , short - term detention , public acts of repudiation
report based on 60 interviews researchers conducted in person in @entity4 and on the telephone from @entity94
