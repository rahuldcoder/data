the devices used in the @entity2 attack monday are typical of the " lone wolf : " the solo terrorist who builds a bomb on his own by following a widely available formula			1
in this case , the formula seems very similar to one that @entity8 has recommended to its supporters around the world as both crudely effective and difficult to trace			2
but it is also a recipe that has been adopted by extreme right - wing individuals in the @entity15			1
the threat of the " lone wolf " alarms the intelligence community			1
" this is what you worry about the most , " a source with knowledge of the investigation told @entity23 's chief political analyst @entity22			1
" no trail , no intelligence			1
" officials have told @entity23 that among the materials used in the attack on the marathon were some sort of timing device , a basic mixture of explosives and some sort of metal container containing nails and other projectiles			0
the @entity40 said late tuesday that what appeared to be fragments of ball bearings , or bbs , and nails had been recovered and had possibly been contained in a pressure cooker			0
one federal law enforcement source told @entity23 's @entity48 the devices contained " low - velocity improvised explosive mixture -- perhaps flash - powder or sugar chlorate mixture likely packed with nails or shrapnel			1
" an explosives expert told @entity23 the yellowness of the flame probably came from carbon or some organic fuel such as sugar that contains it			0
the expert , who is frequently consulted by the @entity40 and other government agencies , said the white smoke made it " unlikely that a military - grade high explosive , such as those used in shells and bombs , which is usually grey or black , was used			1
" @entity15 rep. @entity71 , chairman of the @entity72 , said " most likely gun powder " was used in the devices			1
such improvised devices use readily available materials that can not be easily traced			2
@entity79 , in its @entity78 - language online magazine inspire , noted such " ingredients are readily available " and they are " easily disposed of if the enemy searches your home			1
" there is no evidence that @entity79 or any of its supporters was involved in the @entity88 attack			1
nor is it clear whether the attack was the work of one or more individuals			0
but @entity79 has championed ' do - it - yourself terrorism ' in the last three years , urging @entity94 in the @entity95 to take action on their own			1
" how to make a bomb in @entity103 , " published in a 2010 edition of @entity105 , has been downloaded by @entity98 militants plotting terrorist attacks in both the @entity15 and the @entity100 , according to counterterrorism officials			1
eight pages were devoted to building a basic but lethal device			0
the ingredients included sugar and a black powder made from match heads			0
combining step - by - step instructions and diagrams , the magazine described wiring a " timed circuit as it is simple " and using small nails as shrapnel			2
it said gunpowder or powder from fireworks can be used as a substitute for match heads			0
it continues : " it only works if contained in a high - pressure environment			2
so you may use iron pipes , pressure cookers , fire extinguishers or empty propane canisters ... the pressure cooker is the most effective method			0
" the @entity15 @entity133 has issued several unclassified bulletins about the use of pressure cookers as part of an explosive device			1
in july 2010 , the @entity133 said that while pressure cookers are common in countries such as @entity144 , " the presence of a pressure cooker in an unusual location such as a building lobby or busy street corner should be treated as suspicious			0
" such a formula is certainly not unique to @entity79			2
variations appear all over the @entity147			0
a senior @entity15 counterterrorism investigator told @entity23 that pressure cooker bombs have also been a signature of extreme right - wing individuals in the @entity15 who he said tend to revel in building homemade bombs			1
for example , the devices planted by @entity156 at an @entity158 park during the @entity159 were pipe bombs filled with gunpowder and nails to increase their lethality ; it also had an alarm clock as a timing mechanism			2
like the bombings in @entity88 , those devices were concealed in a backpack , according to a @entity133 report detailing the 1996 attack			2
at least two previous terrorist plots on @entity15 soil have involved variations on the @entity105 recipe , and both involved " lone wolves			1
" @entity180 @entity179 tried to detonate a vehicle bomb in @entity182 in 2010 that included " a pressure cooker containing approximately 120 firecrackers , " according to the 2010 @entity133 bulletin			0
the indictment against another alleged " lone wolf " militant , @entity188 , described a video " showing the defendant following precisely the instructions from the @entity105 article by ( i ) scraping the heads from the matches and collecting the incendiary powder in a bowl ; and ( ii ) connecting a @entity199 tree light to the battery using wiring to create an ignition device			1
" @entity188 was arrested by @entity204 police in november 2011 and pleaded not guilty to state terrorism charges			0
he had not received training overseas , but @entity179 had received training from a bomb - maker with the @entity210 @entity209			2
and exactly one year before @entity188 's arrest , @entity211 flew to @entity213 from @entity214			0
there he built a powerful but rudimentary bomb , using ingredients he was able to purchase locally : pressure cookers , fireworks , explosive chemicals , and nails and ball bearings			0
he too had received bomb - making training , not in @entity210 , like many others , but in @entity225			0
@entity226 died when he tried to detonate a device in central @entity228 in december 2010 .			0

@entity2 bombs seem to follow widely available recipe , experts say
" lone wolf " devices worry the intelligence community because there 's " no trail , no intelligence "
@entity79 , @entity15 right - wing extremists use hard - to - trace bombs , experts say
