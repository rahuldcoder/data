@entity2 , @entity3 @entity1 authorities remain on course to execute two @entity3 for drug trafficking , despite pleas for leniency made by the government in @entity10 and six former prime ministers			1
@entity3 's second longest serving premier , @entity12 , said : " @entity13 being shown in such circumstances would not weaken the deterrent effect of @entity1 's strong anti-drug laws , " while @entity17 , who served as premier on two occasions , said : " as a deep , long - standing friend of @entity1 , i would respectfully request an act of clemency			1
" @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26 all followed suit in a united plea to @entity1 's president			1
@entity32 and @entity33 , members of the so - called " @entity31 , " were sentenced to death in 2006 and after several failed legal appeals and two denials of clemency , their execution by firing squad may now be close			2
@entity42 's @entity41 prison was given permission this week to move @entity32 and @entity33 to a maximum security facility on the island of @entity46 to have their sentence carried out			1
but the transfer has now been delayed due to " technical reasons			0
" on friday , @entity51 quoted the vice president 's office as saying the executions will be delayed for up to a month			0
the two men were among five inmates scheduled to be transferred , @entity54 , a spokesman for the @entity1 attorney general 's office , told @entity4			1
@entity54 said requests from @entity3 officials for the families to spend more time with the prisoners had been granted			1
he also said one of the prisoners , a @entity65 , needs medical attention			0
@entity54 added that there was an issue with the holding cell at the prison where the executions would take place			0
the inmates will be transferred when those issues are resolved , he said			0
perhaps fearing a boycott , national carrier @entity75 has said it would not be involved in their transportation			0
most observers believe the executions will proceed despite a last minute appeal to @entity1 's @entity82 and a new claim that the 2006 trial judges offered a lighter sentence in exchange for a bribe			1
and this has n't gone down well in @entity3			1
speaking on monday , @entity3 prime minister @entity89 asked @entity1 to reconsider their position on @entity32 and @entity33 , considered the ringleaders of the @entity31 -- a group of nine @entity3 who failed in a bid to smuggle more than eight kilograms of heroin back to their country in 2005			1
" well , what we understand is that there are still legal options available to these two @entity3 and their legal teams and we certainly appreciate that the @entity1 government does n't normally go ahead with executions of this type , while there are legal options still available and that 's what we 're saying to the @entity1 government , " he said			1
at the weekend , @entity89 struck a more combative tone when he told @entity110 on the ten television network " we will be finding ways to make our displeasure felt			0
" he did not detail what the government intended to do			2
" what we are asking of @entity1 is what @entity1 asks of other countries when its citizens are on death row , and if it 's right for @entity1 to ask and expect some kind of clemency , it 's surely right for us to ask and expect some kind of clemency , " he said			1
it 's also a point that the mothers of the two men , @entity128 and @entity129 struggle to comprehend			2
" they are helping the @entity1 citizens overseas who are on death row and what is the difference between my son and these people overseas ? " @entity32 told reporters in @entity138 , where she had sought the help of @entity1 's @entity141			1
" i do n't want my son murdered			0
" read more : capital punishment : inhumane aberration or necessary deterrent ? but on tuesday , @entity1 foreign minister @entity147 told @entity4 that @entity3 should not interfere with @entity1 law and policy			1
" although we understand the position of the @entity3 government ... it should be underlined that this issue is purely a law enforcement issue			1
law enforcement against extraordinary crime			0
law enforcement by a sovereign country , @entity1 , " she said			1
" both @entity1 and @entity3 have wide ranging cooperation in many fields -- political , security , trade and investment , as well as sociocultural and people to people			1
" bilateral relations between two counties should be based on mutual respect and mutual benefit			0
@entity1 is committed this principle			1
" meanwhile , the @entity172 has been criticized for its part in the case			1
speaking to media in @entity2 last week , @entity51 deputy commissioner @entity175 admitted the role his force played in the 2005 @entity42 arrests of the nine but denied it was responsible for what then transpired			1
instead of stopping one of the convicted drug mules , @entity183 , from traveling to @entity42 -- which had been the request of his parents -- the @entity51 alerted its counterpart , the @entity188 of his intentions			1
it offered the names of the conspirators , some of whom had been on the @entity51 's radar			0
" the @entity51 had no evidence or lawful reason to detain , much less arrest or charge , any member of the @entity31 before their departure from @entity3 , " the @entity51 noted in a february 7 statement			2
it also explained it could not limit " its cooperation to countries that have similar legal systems as @entity3			2
" the @entity51 is not compelled to answer requests for information about @entity3 from countries where the death penalty might be imposed , but there are no guidelines to stop it volunteering information , as it did with the @entity31			1
opinion : why executions wo n't win @entity1 's drug war @entity32 and @entity33 have become model prisoners during their time behind bars , according to fellow inmates and the jail 's chief warden			2
@entity32 is studying fine arts and has set up a class for fellow inmates			0
@entity33 has found spirituality , which he uses to counsel inmates with drug problems			0
their rehabilitation is genuine , @entity3 's foreign minister @entity227 said			2
" @entity33 and @entity32 are the model of what penal systems the world over long to achieve , " @entity227 told the @entity3 @entity230 last week			2
the foreign affairs spokesperson for the opposition @entity237 , @entity235 delivered a personal account of what it means to be given a second chance			0
long before she met her husband , he 'd been convicted in @entity3 of conspiracy to import heroin from @entity245 where the death penalty applies to such crimes			1
aged 19 , @entity248 was sentenced to nine years in prison but released after three			0
he is now one of the most respected public servants in state of @entity252 and the father of three children , all of which might not have been , said @entity235			0
" i feel a genuine debt of gratitude , " @entity248 told @entity4			0
" so like it or not , you have to accept a deeper sense of responsibility to try to make something useful of your life to repay the trust people have invested in you , " said @entity248 , the current secretary of the @entity259			0
short of a miracle , redemption is not a gift likely to be offered to @entity32 and @entity33			0
if last - minute appeals fail , @entity32 and @entity33 will be allowed a few final choices : whether to stand or kneel , wear a blindfold or face the 12 man firing squad , one or more of whom will kill them			0
the hashtag , # @entity279 trends in @entity3 whenever news of the men 's plight features in the media			2
while @entity33 's parents have now left @entity42 , @entity32 's will stay to the end			2
as they prepare for what appears inevitable , it is surely little comfort for them to know that according to the @entity293 , the man police suspect was the mastermind of their son 's trafficking enterprise is reportedly living a life of luxury in @entity2			0
he was investigated but escaped prosecution and is believed to have won @entity300 $ 3.89 million in a lottery just after the young @entity3 were convicted			2
his fortunes stand in stark contrast to that of @entity305 and @entity33			0
@entity4 's @entity306 in @entity138 contributed to this report .			0
