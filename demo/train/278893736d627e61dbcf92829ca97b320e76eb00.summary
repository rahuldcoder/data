@entity0 -- thrust from obscurity to notoriety overnight , capt. @entity2 is the man at the center of the questions and recriminations over the @entity11 cruise ship disaster			0
as transcripts emerge of his conversations with the @entity16 coast guard on the fateful friday night the ship ran aground , the 52 - year - old 's every word is being pored over for clues as to what happened			0
a picture is beginning to develop of a man who spent decades at sea , but who his employers say did not live up to his training or responsibilities at the helm of his ship			0
with at least 11 deaths confirmed and about two dozen people still missing , @entity32 may face charges including manslaughter , shipwreck and abandoning a ship when passengers were still on board , chief prosecutor @entity31 has said			2
it also has been widely suggested @entity32 may have been " showboating " when he sailed the luxury cruise liner so close to the island of @entity44 , where submerged rocks tore through the hull			1
@entity32 , who has said he will cooperate with investigators , says the rocks were uncharted , and his lawyer says @entity32 did everything he could to preserve the lives of crew and passengers			1
read court documents on the case against @entity2 ( trans. by @entity57 ) a native of @entity63 , near the southern city of @entity65 , @entity32 comes from a seafaring family , @entity61 's @entity60 newspaper reports			1
he graduated from the well - regarded @entity68 nautical institute in @entity69 , in @entity65 province , 30 years ago , according to the news agency @entity71			1
he joined @entity72 in 2002 as a safety officer , served as a staff captain , and was appointed captain in 2006 , according to the cruise line			1
like all @entity72 masters , the cruise line said , @entity32 " has been constantly trained , passing all tests			1
" @entity72 chairman @entity79 said @entity32 had never been involved in an accident before			1
he also played down the possibility that alcohol may have played a role in the disaster , saying he did not believe @entity32 drank , and that all crew were subject to random drug and alcohol tests by @entity72			1
but @entity79 placed the blame for the wreck squarely on the captain , saying it was his choice to deviate from frequently traveled routes			0
@entity60 reported that @entity32 came close to @entity44 to salute @entity93 , a legend among @entity72 ' commanders , and as a gesture to the only @entity44 native on board , chief steward @entity96			1
@entity32 , who according to the @entity99 newspaper was well thought of by fellow sailors in @entity65 , is under house arrest at his family home in @entity103 , where some residents have come to his defense			1
judge @entity106 told a court in @entity108 , the provincial capital , that there was substantial evidence against @entity32 and spoke of " the grave imprudence and inexperience " that had marked his behavior			2
the court heard that @entity32 was accused of abandoning about 300 people who were unable to look after themselves , and to whom he had a responsibility as captain , when he left the ship before they did			1
he made no serious attempt to get back on board the ship and was " totally incapable of managing " the emergency , the judge said			0
the judge said the captain admitted to to making a mistake and that , at the time of the collision , he was navigating by sight			0
but , ordering his house arrest , @entity106 said he had shown no signs of trying to flee the scene after the accident and that there was no danger of him tampering with the evidence			1
there was also no risk of him committing the same offense again , @entity106 said , saying @entity32 had expressed " intent to change his life " and no longer work on ships			2
for the time being , @entity32 is confined to his family home , and can only communicate with those he lives with , the judge ordered			1
it was to his mother , @entity145 , that @entity32 made a call at 5 a.m. saturday , according to the @entity57 newspaper , telling her that " a tragedy " had occurred and that he had " tried to save as many passengers as possible			2
" the captain reportedly told her " not to worry because it was all over			0
" a rather different picture has emerged from the transcripts of conversations between @entity32 and the @entity16 coast guard published by @entity60			2
in those , the captain gives conflicting accounts of what happened when the ship hit rocks just off @entity61 's western coast , leading to what passengers described as a chaotic and surreal scene as they rushed to evacuate			1
@entity32 initially appears to play down the scale of the disaster , saying only that a " technical failure " has occurred			0
@entity32 then tells an official he has abandoned the vessel , according to the transcripts , which prosecutors say match those used in their investigation			0
but as the official questions his decision , @entity32 appears to reverse course and says he did not abandon ship but was " catapulted into the water " after the ship ran into a rock , began taking on water and started listing			0
as the night unfolds , the coast guard commander repeatedly questions why @entity32 , as captain , is not on the ship when passengers are still aboard			1
but @entity32 appears unwilling either to go back on board or to take charge of the desperate evacuation efforts , the transcripts reveal			0
prosecutors have ruled out technical error as a cause of the accident , saying @entity32 was on the bridge at the time the ship ran aground and made a " grave error " that led to the disaster			0
the @entity16 coast guard and @entity72 are still investigating why @entity32 took the ship so close to shore in an area known for its rocky sea floor			1
@entity72 has said that " preliminary indications are that there may have been significant human error on the part of the ship 's master , capt. @entity2 , which resulted in these grave consequences			0
" " the route of the vessel appears to have been too close to the shore , and the captain 's judgment in handling the emergency appears to have not followed standard @entity72 procedures , " the statement added			2
in addition to questions over how @entity32 handled himself after the wreck , questions also lingered about whether the captain should have ordered an evacuation sooner and why no " mayday " distress signal was sent			2
the captain 's attorney , @entity222 , said in a statement monday that @entity32 was " shattered , dismayed , saddened for the loss of lives and strongly disturbed			2
" but , he said , @entity32 is " nonetheless comforted by the fact that he maintained during those moments the necessary lucidity to put in place a difficult emergency maneuver ... bringing the ship to shallow waters			0
" that move , @entity222 said , saved the lives of many passengers and crew members			0
the eyes of the world will likely remain on @entity32 as investigators come to their own conclusions about the role he played in a catastrophe some have likened to the sinking of the @entity246 a century ago			0
@entity1 's @entity247 , @entity248 and journalist @entity249 contributed to this report .			0

@entity32 trained at a well - regarded nautical institute , local media report
he was appointed captain by the @entity72 cruise line in 2006
@entity32 , now under house arrest at his family home , comes from a seafaring background
he argues the rocks he hit were uncharted ; @entity72 says he took an *unauthorized* course
