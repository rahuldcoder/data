@entity0 -- the @entity2 proposed two new rules friday that it estimates could eliminate up to 1.25 million foodborne illnesses each year from such pathogens as @entity6 , @entity7 and @entity8			1
the new regulations are part of the 2011 @entity11 , which aims to make the agency more proactive at preventing outbreaks			2
each year one out of every six @entity14 gets sick from foodborne illnesses , according to estimates by the @entity17			1
roughly 128,000 people are hospitalized and 3,000 die			0
" we really need to do more than react after the fact , " @entity2 commissioner dr. @entity19 said in a news briefing			1
" preventing problems before they cause harm is not only common sense , it is key to food safety in the 21st century			2
" one rule requires " science - based standards for growing , harvesting , packing and holding produce on domestic and foreign farms			2
" it addresses a variety of possible routes of food contamination including the manure used as fertilizer , water sprayed on crops , animals in the fields , whether workers wash their hands and how packing houses process foods			0
the other rule sets out guidelines for " preventive controls for human food " and would require companies to have plans for foodborne illnesses			1
" it 's basic common sense , " said @entity54 , @entity2 deputy commissioner for foods and veterinary medicine			1
" in each individual facility the operator simply must identify the potential hazards , identify the controls that can work ... to reduce those hazards , implement those controls on a continuing basis , document , keep records and then make corrections when needed			0
" the two proposed rules will be available for public comment for 120 days			1
if they go into effect as written , companies would have up to four years , depending on their size , to comply			0
food safety advocates applauded the new rules			1
" this is a really important step toward food safety standards that would prevent contamination whether it is produced in a food factory or being produced on a farm , " said @entity76 , director of the @entity77 at the @entity78			1
" unfortunately , it took a series of large foodborne illness outbreaks to make people wake up and say this is a problem that needs to be addressed			2
" salmonella in peanut butter sickened 42 people last fall and cantaloupes tainted with @entity7 infected 146 people and killed 30 in 2011 , according to the @entity17			0
" you can just look at a couple of recent outbreaks that were quite serious in terms of burden of illnesses and they occurred because of problems that would have been addressed by these kinds of approaches , " @entity19 said , without referencing specific incidents			2
still , concerns remain over whether the agency will be able to make the new rules work as intended			0
" one of the key questions here is resources for @entity2 and making sure that @entity2 has enough money , enough resources to enforce this , " @entity76 said			2
when asked about the cost of the program , @entity115 was not able to provide a price tag			0
" it 's difficult to answer both in terms of overall cost and initial cost to implement , " she said			0
" there will also be savings overall to the system and new efficiencies , and of course prevention of problems that would have taken a toll both in health and on industry and health care			0
" the agency expects private companies will enforce the new guidelines on their suppliers and counts on partnerships with local governments to help police them			0
" @entity2 may do some inspections , but we have limited resources to inspect produce operations and we have a clear direction from @entity148 to collaborate with state agencies so we expect much of the oversight to come at the state and local level , " @entity54 said			1
the @entity2 says additional rules are expected , including those addressing foreign suppliers , animal food and third - party auditors			1
@entity1 's @entity158 contributed to this report .			0
