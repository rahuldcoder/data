while many people spent @entity3 doing last - minute shopping , two @entity1 astronauts had a more challenging matter to attend to tuesday			2
in orbit more than 200 miles above @entity10 , flight engineers @entity6 and @entity8 embarked on a spacewalk tuesday morning to repair part of the @entity14 's cooling system			1
the spacewalk ended at 2:23 p.m. et tuesday and lasted 7 hours and 30 minutes , @entity15 said			1
more than four hours into the job , the two astronauts had successfully bolted a replacement ammonia pump module into its location and were working to connect lines to allow the ammonia to flow , @entity15 said in a tweet			1
there was a slight kink in the work when one of the fluid lines tangled			0
the astronauts untangled it , but when they did , the line released some ammonia flakes that landed on their space suits			0
it was not a leak , but some residue , @entity15 spokesman @entity36 said			0
the ammonia that landed on the spacesuits will require the spacewalkers to air out their suits before going back into the station , but is otherwise not a big deal , he said			0
the two engineers were carrying out the second in a series of expeditions needed to replace a malfunctioning pump , which circulates ammonia through loops outside the station to keep equipment cool			1
the pump developed problems december 11 when an internal valve stuck in an incorrect position			0
the space station 's life support system remains up and running , but operations were cut back as a result of the problem , @entity15 said			1
it is the second @entity3 spacewalk in history , according to @entity15			1
the two astronauts spent about 5Â½ hours outside the space station saturday working to remove the problematic pump			2
spacesuit problem @entity6 used a different spacesuit after a small amount of water leaked into the cooling system of the one he wore saturday			2
@entity15 said the issue with the suit , which happened at the end of the spacewalk , was unrelated to a problem experienced in july when water pooled in an @entity80 astronaut 's helmet , causing a spacewalk to be cut short			2
" both @entity6 and @entity8 reported dry conditions repeatedly throughout saturday 's activities and the two were never in danger , " the agency said			0
@entity15 had installed new safeguards , including snorkels inside the spacesuits that would allow astronauts to take breaths if water formed and they had to return to the space station			0
tuesday 's spacewalk was the 176th to support the space station 's assembly and maintenance , according to @entity15			1
the previous @entity3 spacewalk took place in 1999 , the agency said , when @entity104 astronauts @entity102 and @entity105 spent more than eight hours refitting parts of the @entity107			1
the others on board the @entity14 at the moment include @entity112 cosmonauts @entity113 , @entity114 and @entity115 and @entity117 astronaut @entity116 .			0

@entity15 : the spacewalk has concluded , lasting 7 hours and 30 minutes
the astronauts are trying to fix a problem on the @entity14
a malfunctioning pump in the station 's cooling system needed to be replaced
it 's the second @entity3 spacewalk in history , @entity15 says
