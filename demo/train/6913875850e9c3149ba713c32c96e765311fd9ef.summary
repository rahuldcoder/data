-- the @entity2 scandal was just starting to reach a rolling boil last month when the @entity4 announced that it would be investigating the school for a possible violation of the @entity7			2
a quarter century ago , @entity8 was asleep in her @entity10 dorm room when she was raped and killed by an intruder			0
the act came about after @entity8 's parents discovered that more than three dozen violent crimes had been committed on the campus over the three years before their daughter 's murder ; yet administrators did n't see fit to disclose this information			1
in 1990 , @entity20 passed the @entity21 and @entity22 , requiring that schools that receive federal funds report crime statistics and make timely warnings to the campus community about crimes that pose a threat to students and employees			0
often it takes a tragedy to establish or improve public policy			0
so it is that the recent flurry of high - profile child sex abuse scandals will surely trigger change and reform			1
we can start here : suspending the statute of limitations in these types of cases			0
laws vary among states , but in most cases , when victims reach a certain age , perpetrators can no longer be charged with these crimes , nor can the accusers seek remedies in civil court			1
the statute of limitations in @entity58 for bringing civil claims for child sex abuse is five years after it was reported to police or five years after the victim turns 18			1
that was also the standard for criminal prosecutions , until it was lifted altogether in 2008 for first - degree rape , aggravated sexual abuse and course of sexual conduct against a child			2
in @entity73 , the criminal statute of limitations extends until the victim reaches the age of 50			2
but child sex abuse victims must file civil suits before they turn 30 -- and the law was enacted in august 2002 , so survivors who turned 20 before the law was enacted are barred from suing their perpetrators			1
how does this apply to the recent cases in @entity2 and @entity83 ? if a victim of @entity86 was born before 1982 , he is likely time - barred from bringing action against the disgraced former @entity2 football coach			1
( given that it was in 1977 that @entity86 established the @entity90 -- the organization through which , prosecutors allege , he cultivated relationships with victims -- this is significant			1
) in @entity83 , despite finding the allegations to be credible , prosecutors have already declined to pursue criminal sex abuse charges against former assistant basketball coach @entity98			1
why ? because the men accusing @entity98 of molestation in the 1980s are well into adulthood , and the statute of limitations has long since lapsed			1
there are various reasons why we have statutes of limitations for crimes , other than the worst felonies , and for torts			0
we want to encourage plaintiffs to bring suit as quickly after the alleged injury as possible			1
potential defendants should be able to get on with their lives without worrying about getting charged or sued for acts alleged from long ago			2
if anyone could sue anyone at anytime it would further clog an already congested legal system			2
in most cases , this all makes sense			0
not so for child sexual abuse			2
the very nature of the crime is predicated on secrecy and shame and manipulation			1
it often takes years , decades even , for victims to grasp what has happened : that an adult , often a trusted authority figure or a family member , did horribly wrong by them			1
regardless of the guilt or innocence of @entity86 or @entity98 , the obvious complexity and ambiguity of the relationships they had with their accusers , as well as the intense public fallout in the wake of the allegations , offer graphic examples of why alleged victims might feel disabled well into adulthood			1
shutting the door on accusers only serves to arm the molesters with still another advantage in what is already an unfair fight			2
@entity160 knows this first hand			0
now 41 , she maintains that , as a young girl growing up in @entity163 , @entity73 , she was raped by a favorite relative			0
conflicted , ashamed , scared to risk fraying the tapestry of her tight - knit family , she held it as a deeply guarded secret			0
in the late ' 90s , she felt that she could no longer stay quiet			0
as it turned out , several of her cousins claimed to have had similar experiences			0
together , they went to the local prosecutor , only to be told they had been time - barred			0
" it was just that he was n't brought to justice , " says @entity160 , who went on to found the foundation to abolish @entity180 " when he was n't charged and there could be no civil case , he could n't be named publically ... worse than injustice for victims is the paralysis and guilt that we feel over not being able to spare a new generation of kids the horrors of abuse that we experienced as children			1
" over the objections of numerous groups -- insurance lobbies , teachers unions , @entity201 clergymen -- some states have decided to suspend the statute of limitations for these crimes , a tacit recognition of the unique dynamics of child sex crimes			2
@entity208 recently suspended the statute of limitations for two years , creating a window for those previously time - barred to come forward			0
more than 100 alleged victims emerged			1
in @entity215 , a similar suspension spurred more than 300 lawsuits , some dating back to episodes from the 1950s			0
" it 's clear that it can take a long , long time before victims are ready to confront abuse and everything that can come with it , " says @entity219 , a law professor at @entity220 and a lawyer for one of the accusers in the @entity86 case			1
" it 's just wrong to have [ policy ] that favors the predator			0
" a vast body of research indicates that the effects of childhood sexual abuse often span a lifetime			0
the opportunity to seek justice should last just as long			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity242 .			2

@entity242 : charges of sex abuse ca n't be pursued once victims reach certain age
but abuse *depends* on secrecy and shame , he says , so victims often take years to reveal it
prosecutors wo n't bring case against @entity98 because accusers are too old , he writes
@entity242 : in @entity86 case , alleged victims can not sue after the age of 30
