-- when you finish one video game in a series and begin the next , you 're basically forced to start from scratch without carrying over any of your accomplishments from the previous game			2
but the popular " @entity8 " sci - fi action trilogy aims to change that -- by allowing players to complete one game and transfer their character to the next one in the series			1
it is an ambitious project that involves nearly 35,000 lines of dialogue			1
" we wanted to create the biggest story we could tell , " said @entity17 , @entity18 's project director for " @entity19 " and executive producer of the " @entity8 " franchise			1
the just - released " @entity19 " picks up the story as the lead character , named @entity26 , has been brought back to life after a devastating attack by an invading race of machines bent on eliminating organic life			1
the action takes place shortly after the events of the first " @entity19 , " which was set in the year 2183 in the @entity36 galaxy			2
in a rare twist , players who played the first " @entity8 " game are being given the opportunity to import their characters into the new game along with all their rewards , romances and consequences			1
@entity17 said his team tried to create a fictional universe that players could explore over long periods of time to " have an epic experience			2
" by carrying over the data from the original " @entity19 , " @entity17 's team tried to show the consequences of characters ' choices			1
but by accounting for so many variables in the first games , @entity18 was faced with a daunting task going forward			0
" we used tech skills we developed going back to ' @entity62 ' [ in 1998 ] , " @entity17 explained			0
" writing for ' @entity63 ' was the hardest thing we 've ever done			1
" " @entity19 " has 15 to 20 percent more dialogue and 30 percent more key decisions -- choices that affect the game 's outcome -- than the first game , said @entity17 , who believes the voice acting in the new game is more movie - like than the first one			1
" it took several months of voice work , and often we would bring back an actor to get the right inflections for the character and the scene , " he said			0
" there are hundreds of characters in the game that needed voices			2
" although " @entity19 " is being billed as a dark second chapter in the trilogy , there are laugh - out - loud moments of dialogue			1
playing the game reveals that even its tense moments are given a softer edge with unexpected comic exchanges between characters			0
for example , in one scene , @entity26 tries to persuade a character not to follow orders that could lead to a " suicide mission			0
" without missing a beat , @entity26 's squad mates look at each other as one says , " we can ignore suicidal orders ? why was n't i told about that ? " " @entity19 " also offers players the opportunity to interrupt a conversation and create a whole new path			1
during a scene when another character is talking , icons will appear to let you change the conversation with a @entity115 move ( good ) or @entity117 move ( bad )			0
side plots tie into the main story more than in the first game , so even these chat - interrupting choices could have an impact later on			2
" things can happen in conversation , " @entity17 said when asked about the interrupt feature			0
" it makes the conversation feel alive			0
" work has already begun to complete the final chapter of the " @entity8 " trilogy			2
and gamers should n't assume that @entity26 makes it to the end of " @entity133			0
" @entity17 said @entity26 can die a final death if the player makes wrong choices or inspires bad loyalty from his crew			0
" we made it so you 'll still get a satisfying ending , but yes , @entity26 can actually die , " he said .			0

players who played the first " @entity8 " game can import their data into the new game
" writing for ' @entity63 ' was the hardest thing we 've ever done , " project director says
" @entity19 " has 15 ***%*** to 20 ***%*** more dialogue and 30 ***%*** more decision - making options
