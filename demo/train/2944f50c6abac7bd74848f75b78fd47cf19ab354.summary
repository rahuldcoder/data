-- the shooting down of a @entity3 helicopter in central @entity4 with the loss of 38 lives -- most of them @entity7 -- highlights two crucial aspects of the conflict in @entity4 , as @entity11 forces begin to draw down and @entity4 security forces start taking the lead			1
the first is the growing reliance on @entity15 to combat the @entity16 and other insurgent groups -- in operations every night across the country			1
the second is that many areas far beyond the @entity16 's traditional strongholds in the south remain very insecure , areas where the @entity16 have exploited an instinctive wariness of a foreign force among locals -- and punished those who dare to work with them			2
one such place is the @entity31 in @entity33 province , where the crash occurred in the early hours of saturday morning			2
soldiers who have served there describe it as perfect territory for insurgents , with steep mountainsides of shale and boulders overlooking orchards and thick vegetation			2
improvised bombs are regularly planted along the one road that runs through the valley , next to the @entity48 , and detonated from vantage points above			2
( @entity51 officials say that the @entity53 ' control wires are laid across the river , making pursuit of the insurgents more difficult			2
) @entity57 is only 60 miles from @entity58 , close to the main highway south			2
but the @entity16 ( though not @entity60 or other foreign groups ) have long been active in the area			2
in 2009 , soldiers in the @entity65 's 10th @entity64 were deployed to this part of @entity33			2
they encountered 57 roadside bombs in the valley in just three months , dubbing the road " ied alley " and " @entity75 , " a reference to the @entity65 medical center where many soldiers wounded in @entity4 have received treatment			1
firefights were an almost daily occurrence			0
on his blog this weekend , a former member of the @entity79 recently deployed to @entity81 wrote of the village where the helicopter came down			0
" juy @entity84 is a village we went to frequently during our deployment and never found anything good while out there			0
in fact it was a wonderful place to go if we felt like getting into contact			0
" back in the 1980s , the @entity94 was never able to pacify the region , and @entity97 convoys were frequently ambushed there			0
earlier this year @entity11 forces passed control of the military post in the valley to @entity4 troops			1
lt. col. @entity103 of the @entity104 handed over @entity81 to a unit of the @entity106			0
" as we lose @entity11 personnel , we have to concentrate on the greater populations , " @entity103 told the @entity65 website at the time			1
but the afghan @entity65 did not maintain a permanent presence at the outpost , according to officials of the @entity114 ( @entity114 )			0
as elsewhere , especially in eastern @entity4 , @entity11 forces are now returning to areas previously seen as too remote to focus on or too difficult to defend , where the @entity16 and other insurgent groups have filled the vacuum			1
as they do , the risk of casualties grows -- as does the role of @entity11 special forces			1
the use of @entity15 ( @entity125 ) in @entity4 has grown exponentially			1
in a talk two weeks ago at the @entity128 , the outgoing commander of the @entity11 @entity130 , adm. @entity126 , disclosed that @entity125 carried out " somewhere between 3,000 and 4,000 operations " in 2010 alone			1
" this is now routine , every night ...			0
ground forces getting on a helicopter and flying against a target , " @entity133 said			2
the template of such operations includes " a quick reaction force on call to render assistance should things go bad , " @entity133 said			2
in friday night 's attack , it was the quick reaction force , on its way to assist an ongoing mission by @entity147 , that perished			0
speaking of the @entity7 who took part in the mission that killed @entity151 , adm. @entity133 made their role sound almost mundane			0
" for the people involved it was another mission and another target ...			0
this is not a force that sits on the second deck of the fire station waiting for the bell to ring every 10 or 15 years			0
we trace our lessons back to what we did last night			0
" who are the @entity7 ? but he also recognized the huge burden now falling on @entity15 to subdue the @entity16			1
" we are beginning to fray around the edges			0
we are asking an awful lot of our people , " he said at the @entity171 conference , adding that @entity125 units were seeing " a lot of separations short of divorce			1
" but 82 % of @entity125 troops who have the choice of leaving or staying in choose the latter , according to @entity133			1
and more will be asked of them			0
of the 33,000 @entity11 troops due to be withdrawn from @entity4 by the end of 2012 , none will be special forces			1
@entity130 -- drawn from all four branches of the @entity11 military -- has grown to a strength of 60,000			1
with a $ 10 billion budget it is now larger than the @entity191 and about the same size as the entire @entity193			0
and the caliber of its members reflects its special status			2
thirty percent are college graduates			0
they are more experienced than regular soldiers , with an average age of 30 , and they volunteer multiple times			0
@entity133 says 60 % of @entity125 have joined since september 11 , 2001 -- and the aim is to keep them in the military for an average of 20 years			1
@entity125 operations in @entity4 have at times been controversial , the subject of criticism from president @entity210 because of civilian casualties			1
in 2010 , then - @entity114 commander gen. @entity212 tightened rules of engagement after a series of raids involved civilian deaths , although some units remained exempt from the directive			1
when he took over , gen. @entity219 expanded the use of @entity125 in an effort to drive the @entity16 out of @entity223 and @entity224 provinces and blunt the @entity225 further east			1
in testimony to @entity227 in march , @entity219 said : " we have stepped up the tempo of precise , intelligence - driven operations to capture or kill insurgent leaders ...			2
in a typical 90 - day period , precision operations by @entity11 special - mission units and their @entity4 partners alone kill or capture some 360 targeted insurgent leaders			1
" it appears the @entity147 were involved in just such a mission in @entity31 -- closing in on @entity16 commanders meeting in a village -- when they called for reinforcement			0
@entity15 remain the sharp end of a multi-pronged approach in @entity4			1
@entity133 said the strategy marries " the counter-terrorism line of operation and the engagement line of operation -- what 's been called village stability operations and the development of @entity4 local police trying to return neighborhoods back to the neighbors			1
" it 's become known as " clear , hold , build , transition " to win over what are euphemistically called " under - governed spaces			0
" such was the aim of commanders in @entity81 two years ago			0
lt. col. @entity260 , battalion commander for the @entity261 , 87th @entity262 , told the @entity263 in march 2009 : " we 'll take the physical terrain from the enemy ... and we 'll take the people away , because the people are the prize in this fight			2
" but even with the surge last year , many areas of @entity4 rarely see an @entity114 soldier			1
and officers acknowledge that while a platoon can show a presence , it might take a company or more to persuade villagers they are secure			0
" successful counter-insurgency is labor intensive , " said one officer			0
one soldier deployed to @entity31 wrote of his experiences on the website @entity285 in january			0
" few of the villagers are openly hostile towards us , but they are always mindful of the @entity16 , who move through the valley at night , " he said			0
" they are in a delicate situation -- we @entity11 have much to offer them , but they know that we will not be in their valley forever , and they know that the ( @entity106 ) and ( @entity295 ) can not fight the insurgency alone			1
" last year , the newspaper @entity298 reported on a planned meeting for farmers in the district			0
two officials from the ministry of agriculture in @entity58 backed out at the last minute , fearing for their safety , and not a single farmer showed up , " leaving a handful of @entity11 soldiers and a lone @entity11 @entity311 representative , sitting on otherwise empty benches in a stiff breeze , with folding tables full of unopened water bottles and unmade tea , " the paper reported			1
the phrase commonly used in @entity4 is : " the @entity11 have the watches , but the @entity16 have the time			1

the use of @entity15 in @entity4 has grown
@entity130 now has a strength of 60,000
commander : @entity125 carried out " somewhere between 3,000 and 4,000 operations " in 2010
of the 33,000 @entity11 troops to be withdrawn by the end of 2012 , none will be special forces
