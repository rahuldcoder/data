-- he was the " @entity2 , " the miracle man and the @entity5 athlete that could take on the very best able - bodied competitors			1
it was a high - profile career that inspired millions , earned lucrative sponsorship deals and bridged the gap between @entity10 and @entity5 competition			2
yet those remarkable sporting triumphs and the fame and fortune it brought @entity2 receded into the distance as the @entity17 stood motionless in the dock in @entity19 as he received a five - year sentence for the fatal shooting of his girlfriend @entity23 on @entity24 2013			1
in the most favorable scenario for @entity2 , he could be released from prison in 10 months under house arrest			1
but even then , former athletes , officials and marketing experts believe a full comeback will be extremely difficult			0
the competition ban a dramatic return in time for the 2016 @entity5 is out of the question after the @entity35 ( @entity35 ) stated that @entity2 would be banned from competing for five years			1
the @entity35 had previously stated that the @entity17 would be allowed to compete in @entity36 if he was not in jail			1
while there is a possibility @entity2 may be out of prison before the @entity42 begin in @entity43 , the @entity35 has since clarified that this will also include any period that @entity2 serves out under house arrest			1
" we 've been quite clear throughout this process we would respect what sanctions the judge put down , " ipc director of media and communications , @entity46 , told @entity0			0
" @entity2 can resume his career if he so wishes once he 's served his sentence in full , " @entity46 added , before clarifying that the @entity35 's position may change should the sentence be reduced or lengthened			1
since bursting on to the scene at the @entity42 of 2004 , @entity2 has been the @entity5 movement 's poster - boy			1
@entity46 acknowledged the huge impact @entity2 has had but he pointed to the wealth of talent and inspirational athletes competing at the @entity64 to emphasize the strength and depth that now exists in para sports			1
" @entity68 showed for us all is that the @entity5 movement is more than one athlete			0
there were lots of athletes that made the headlines in @entity76 ... and the @entity5 movement has continued to go from strength to strength since ( then )			0
" the @entity80 , meanwhile , refused to be drawn on whether today 's sentencing meant @entity2 would be able to compete in future events			1
" we take note of the court 's decision , " said the @entity80 in a statement			0
" this is a human tragedy for the family of @entity23 and also for @entity2			1
we hope very much that time will bring comfort to all those concerned but at this stage we have no further comment to make			0
" the sporting condition @entity2 will be 32 in 2019 when his five - year sentence is up			1
the @entity94 of 2020 could still offer a shot at sporting redemption but there will clearly be a question mark on whether @entity2 ' athletic powers will be on the wane by then			1
former @entity5 athletes like @entity103 's @entity102 have previously stated that even making the @entity104 having missed months of training and competition would have been difficult for @entity2			1
members of the @entity2 family also recently told @entity0 's @entity109 that the athlete 's future career is not part of his immediate plans			1
instead , he would focus on his life in jail , potentially starting a running or gym club whilst behind bars			0
his uncle , @entity119 , told reporters earlier tuesday that " @entity2 will embrace this opportunity to pay back to society			1
as an uncle , i hope @entity2 will start his own healing process as he walks down the path of restoration			2
as a family , we are ready to support and guide @entity2 as he serves his sentence			2
" the sponsors and the brand even if @entity2 does manage to make a miraculous sporting comeback , it is highly unlikely he will be as big a draw to sponsors and fans as he has been in the past			1
the athlete 's image was pulled from billboards across @entity17 after his arrest in 2013 and sponsors suspended their deals			0
" this is the end of his brand , " said @entity144 , professor of sport business strategy and marketing at @entity147 , who added that @entity2 ' transgression was very different to the indiscretions of sports stars like @entity151 or @entity152 , who lost sponsors			1
" none of those people actually killed anyone			0
it 's going to be very , very difficult and very risky for a commercial partner to associate with @entity2 , " @entity144 said			2
" it will reflect too negatively for ( anyone ) to make a commitment to @entity2			2
i think as a global and an international property , this is it , it 's over , it 's the end			0
" however , there are commercial options potentially still available to @entity2			2
" if he comes out of prison and seeks in some way to redeem himself -- maybe if he was to become a very high profile campaigner for women 's rights or for ending violence against women -- and was seen to be taking what has happened ultra-seriously , certain types of brands could be interested , " @entity144 said			0
" that 's a real outside chance and @entity2 would have to work very , very hard			2
" the second option would be if he was able to attract lots of small sponsor			0
" he was a trailblazer in the sense he put the @entity5 movement on the map and in short he 'll be cheap , " added @entity144			0
" small brands trying to raise awareness might choose to associate with the athlete , " but any campaigns would likely be " very low key and possibly domestic			0
" another option is for @entity2 to cash in on giving his side of the story			2
" the third way back for him would inevitably be book deals , maybe a deal for tv -- commercially it may well be he makes money that way , " @entity144 said			0
" what @entity2 needs right now is very careful advice from representatives who really do know what they 're doing			2
" on the one hand there are commercial opportunities there for him but they need to be handled very gently and very thoughtfully			0
if he 's seen to be making too much money it will undermine efforts at redemption			0
" for his agent , business managers , communications consultants this is a huge and very tricky job , " added @entity144			0
" i 'm really not sure there will be a way back for him			0
unless he goes straight into the next @entity5 , breaks a world record and makes all the right noises on redemption			0
" @entity226 : @entity23 , @entity2 @entity0 's @entity109 and @entity227 contributed to this story .			1
