as another snowstorm barrels toward the already - buried @entity3 this weekend , some folks have had just about all they can take			1
dr. @entity4 , an assistant professor of psychiatry at @entity6 , wrote this week that he has " developed a new sympathy for my daughter 's hamster , " on @entity13 's @entity12 blog			1
" she 's seen the same cage , the same scene , the same everything , day in and day out , " @entity4 wrote			1
" but alas , my kid 's hamster can not work scissors , or a remote control for the television , or engage in any sort of higher order thinking			1
" but too much time for thinking in the winter can lead to trouble			1
millions of @entity28 experience a serious mood change during the winter months , when there is less natural sunlight			1
the condition is called seasonal affective disorder , or @entity34			1
according to the @entity36 , it 's a type of depression , with symptoms such as : sad , anxious or " empty " feelings feelings of hopelessness and / or pessimism feelings of guilt , worthlessness or helplessness irritability , restlessness loss of interest or pleasure in activities you used to enjoy fatigue and decreased energy difficulty concentrating , remembering details and making decisions difficulty sleeping or oversleeping changes in weight thoughts of death or suicide while the specific cause of @entity34 remains unknown , researchers have narrowed down a few factors that may come into play			1
" our inner clock , whose timing cycle does not necessarily match day and night outdoors , needs to stay in sync with rest - activity cycles dictated by family and work life , " says @entity66 , a professor of clinical psychology in psychiatry at @entity70 's @entity69			1
" this is both very disorienting and a trigger for mood slumps and depression			1
" " since the inner clock relies on sunlight to stay in sync , winter sunrise is later and winter nights are longer , melatonin can overshoot into the day , causing grogginess or ' brain fog , ' for several hours , " @entity66 says			1
melatonin is a hormone that regulates sleep and wake cycles			1
@entity94 , one of many brain chemicals that affect mood , also varies seasonally , with lower levels in winter			1
according to the @entity98 , @entity34 is diagnosed more often in women than in men , but men typically experience more severe symptoms			1
younger people have a higher risk of @entity34 , and those affected are more likely to have blood relatives with @entity34 or another form of depression			2
so , how can you beat the winter blues ? you 've got a few options : light therapy is typically the treatment most people try first			2
you sit a few feet from a specially designed bright light , which mimics natural outdoor light			2
solid scientific data is lacking , but light therapy appears to cause a change in brain chemicals linked to mood and seems to be effective for most people in relieving @entity34 symptoms			2
you do n't need a prescription from your doctor			2
there are options on websites such as @entity128 for under $ 100			2
the @entity132 does n't regulate light - therapy products and , as you might expect , some of the manufacturers ' claims are confusing and overreaching			2
the general consensus is to look for a light box that provides white light -- as opposed to blue or " full spectrum " -- with 10,000 lux of illumination and a broad diffuser screen that filters out uv rays			2
most patients report phototherapy generally starts working in just a few days and results in few side effects ; at worst : headaches , mild nausea , feelings of restlessness and trouble sleeping			0
if light therapy does n't work , you might ask your doctor about a prescription for an antidepressant , especially if your symptoms are severe			0
keep in mind that it might take a few weeks for the medication to fully kick in			0
additionally , you may have to try a few different medications before you find one that works well for you and has the fewest side effects			0
if you want to go the natural route , psychotherapy is another option to treat @entity34			0
psychotherapy can help you identify and change negative thoughts and behaviors that may be making you feel worse , learn healthy ways to cope with @entity34 and learn how to better manage stress			0
of course , the best solutions to any problem are sometimes the simplest			0
bundle up and take a walk , even a short one			0
even on a cold or cloudy day , outdoor light can help -- especially if you soak it in within the first few hours or waking up in the morning			0
make time to work out			0
exercise helps decrease stress and anxiety , both of which can increase symptoms of @entity34			0
as we all know , being more in shape can make you feel better about yourself , too , which can lift your mood			0
last but not least : socialize			0
when you 're feeling down , it can be hard to be social , but that 's when it 's most important to connect with those around you			0
so grab your spouse , your kids , a neighbor and let us see what you 're up to by posting on social media using the hashtag # @entity196 .			0
