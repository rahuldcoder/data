@entity1 , @entity0 -- the party of @entity0 's ruling prime minister sailed to an easy victory in parliamentary elections on sunday , winning a third term in office with 49.9 % of the vote with 99.9 % of the votes counted			1
but marring the night , 10 people were wounded at a post-election party , the country 's @entity12 news agency said			1
for nearly a decade , @entity16 has dominated @entity0 politics while also defining his country 's assertive new role as an economic and diplomatic power in the region			2
campaigning on his record of unprecedented economic stability and prosperity during nine years in power , @entity16 and his @entity22 ( @entity22 ) succeeded in slightly increasing his mandate			0
the @entity22 won 49.9 % of the vote , an increase of nearly 4 percentage points from the party 's performance in the 2007 parliamentary election			1
" we are thrilled after winning one out of every two voters ' votes in the country , " @entity16 said late sunday night			2
in a victory speech delivered from the balcony of his party headquarters in @entity41 , @entity16 made a pledge to serve all @entity0 , regardless of ethnicity or religious sect			2
" to the @entity0 nation , whether you voted for @entity22 or not , the real winner of the 2011 elections is @entity0 , " @entity16 roared , to a crowd of flag - waving supporters			2
" no one should have any doubt , whether you voted for us or not , all of your beliefs and values and lifestyles are our pride			0
" " the obvious result is another landslide big victory for the incumbent , the @entity22 , " said @entity59 , a @entity0 political analyst with the @entity61 in @entity62			0

it 's the same rule in most democracies , ' it 's the economy , stupid			2
' people vote on bread and butter issues			2
they vote based on their living standards			2
the fact that @entity0 's economy is growing at 9 %			1
the fact that interest rates are low			0
people can borrow , people can spend			0
" prime minister @entity16 added another electoral victory feather to his cap			1
but he fell short of capturing the two - thirds majority in parliament that would have allowed the @entity22 to unilaterally rewrite @entity0 's constitution			1
@entity16 has made no secret of the fact that he intends to rewrite the constitution , a deeply flawed document drafted by a military junta that seized power in 1980			1
and on sunday night , @entity16 made it clear a new constitution would still be a top priority			2
" the nation has assigned us the task of creating a new constitution , " he said			2
" we are not going to close our doors			0
we will go to the opposition			0
if they accept , we will sit down and work towards consensus with civic groups , with parties outside of the parliament , with academics			0
" the largest opposition party , the secular @entity108 ( @entity108 ) won 26 % of the vote			1
that marked a boost of 5 percentage points over its performance in 2007			0
but it also fell short of predictions by the @entity108 officials that the rebranding of the party under new leader @entity119 would lead to a big win at the polls			2
nonetheless , @entity119 declared victory during his own brief post-election speech to supporters			0
" within a short period our party won 3.5 million new votes , " he said			1
" we wish @entity22 success			0
but they should not forget			0
that there is a stronger @entity108 now			0
" a big winner on sunday was the @entity132 ( @entity132 ) , the country 's most influential @entity133 nationalist party			1
young men waving yellow @entity132 flags raced around @entity1 in cars , celebrating the party 's capture of an additional 10 seats in parliament			1
a blast sunday night at a @entity132 post-election celebration in the southeastern town of @entity146 wounded 10 people , six of them critically , the @entity12 news agency said			1
the cause of the explosion was not immediately known			0
the party captured an additional 10 seats in parliament			1
@entity0 still bears the scars of a long guerrilla war waged between @entity133 separatist guerillas and the @entity0 state			1
more than 30,000 people have been killed since the conflict broke out in the early 1980s			0
" we have a very difficult challenge ahead with the @entity133 , " said @entity59 of @entity61			1
" they have high expectations			0
they really want radical reform			0
the new constitution will have to reflect a different understanding of @entity133 citizenship			1
after polls closed sunday , clashes erupted in the predominantly @entity133 city of @entity171			1
a city government official , speaking to @entity2 on condition of anonymity , confirmed reports that police fired tear gas and water cannons to disperse @entity133 youths hurling firecrackers and gasoline bombs			1
in his victory speech , @entity16 addressed the @entity133 , @entity0 's largest -- and long - oppressed -- ethnic minority			1
" we will work harder to end mothers ' crying and end the bloodshed , " he said			0
" we did away with assimilation policies ... we say peace , freedom and democracy in the region			0
" @entity16 and the @entity22 first swept to power in 2002 , after the party won 34 % of the vote , bringing an end to years of weak and crisis - prone coalition governments			1
the party won a much stronger mandate in 2007 parliamentary elections , capturing 47 % of the vote			1
in the run - up to sunday 's election , @entity16 unveiled ambitious plans titled " @entity0 2023 , " which include digging a canal through @entity1 from the @entity205 to the @entity206 , which would parallel the @entity207			1
despite obvious flaws , @entity0 's messy democracy and its booming economy are an inspiration for many in the turbulent @entity213			2
during the height of the revolution in february in @entity218 's @entity217 , many @entity214 pointed to @entity0 as a possible model for future democratic development			2
and more than 5,000 @entity221 have fled across the border to @entity0 in recent days to escape a brutal crackdown on anti-government protesters by @entity221 president @entity225			0
one of the big successes of the @entity16 era in @entity0 has been the assertion of civilian control over the once - meddlesome military , which overthrew four elected governments in 50 years			0
@entity2 's @entity232 and @entity233 contributed to this report .			0
