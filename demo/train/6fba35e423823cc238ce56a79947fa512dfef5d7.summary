-- one of two gay men jailed in @entity2 after they got engaged has been transferred to another prison , a human rights campaigner and gay rights activist said wednesday			1
it was not clear why @entity7 was moved from @entity9 prison , where he had been serving time with his partner , @entity10			1
the pair was sentenced last week to 14 years in prison after being found guilty of gross indecency and unnatural acts			1
though in separate cells at @entity9 , the men were able to see each other briefly " from time to time , " said @entity17 , a @entity18 - based gay rights activist who has been advocating for the men			2
@entity20 , executive director of the @entity2 - based human rights group @entity22 , visited @entity23 in prison wednesday and said @entity7 was not the only prisoner who was moved to another facility			1
@entity27 said he planned to visit @entity28 at the new prison thursday and would learn more then			0
@entity17 expressed fears for @entity28 's mental and physical health			0
no appeal has been scheduled , @entity27 said			0
" the lawyers are going to submit the papers either this week or next week , " he told @entity0 from @entity2			1
" the court is going to give the dates for the appeal , so we ca n't speculate right now because the court has not given the date			0
" lawyers for the men are hopeful the 14 - year sentence will either be reduced or thrown out on appeal , @entity27 said			0
the two men , both in their 20s , were arrested in december at their home in @entity49 , @entity2 , for professing their love in a traditional engagement ceremony			1
they were rounded up after news reports surfaced , charged under colonial - era sodomy laws and detained at @entity9 prison without bail			0
the arrests received some popular support in the conservative southern @entity59 nation , but sparked condemnation by gay - rights activists			2
human - rights groups including @entity63 and @entity64 have called for the couple 's release			0
homosexuality is illegal in @entity2 , as it is in most @entity59 nations , and government officials have said they are simply upholding the law			2

the @entity75 said the prosecution of the two men was driven by prejudice , not jurisprudence			0
