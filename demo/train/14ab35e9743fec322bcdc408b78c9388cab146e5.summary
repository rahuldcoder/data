-- i live in @entity2 , and one of my best friends , @entity5 , lives in @entity6 , so we are n't able to see each other as often as we would like			1
the times we do get together , we like to live it up , and for us , living it up always involves chowing down			1
so last january , when @entity5 sent me an e-mail saying she was coming for the weekend , i knew exactly what restaurant i wanted to take her to			1
most of its customers have been coming for decades ; the waitresses have a good - hearted , cigarette - scented toughness about them ; the steaks are the size of @entity23 ; and the salad dressings are served from a twirling " carousel , " so that you can legitimately play with your food			1
it 's the kind of place that 's frozen in time , where you just have to order a @entity33			1
after @entity5 arrived , i told her where we were headed that night			1
" you 're going to love this place , " i kept saying , and @entity5 , in turn , kept saying , " @entity36			1
" but as the hour approached , a kind of lethargy set in			2
it was freezing outside , and we were so cozy inside , dressed in comfortable , slouchy clothes , listening to good music , turning on lights against a darkening winter sky			2
i asked @entity5 if she would mind if we stayed home			1
" we can have martinis and i 'll cook , ok ? " i said , and she readily agreed			2
@entity0 : 5 inspirational friendships what to make ? i wondered			2
suddenly i remembered that my neighbor @entity51 had given me a recipe , saying , " i really liked this , and i think you will , too			2
" it was for a sausage and bean ragout , and when i read the list of ingredients , i thought , hmm			2
it 's easy to make and even low - fat			2
i 'm going to make it ! then i never did			2
but now @entity51 's recipe seemed just right for the occasion , even though neither @entity5 nor i , experienced ( and good ) cooks both , knew exactly what a " ragout " was			1
i mixed up some martinis , put a cd on the stereo , cranked up the volume , and tied on my apron			2
while i browned spicy turkey sausage and onion and garlic , @entity5 sang along with the singer - songwriter @entity77 and danced around the dining - room table			1
it is one thing to see your friend dance around a table when she 's 25 , quite another thing to see her doing it when she 's 62			2
i love a 62 - year - old woman who does n't shy from thrusting her pelvis out all over the place ; i could n't stop smiling			1
@entity0 : when friendships go wrong then @entity5 lowered the volume on the stereo and came to sit down at the kitchen table			1
" i need to talk to you about something , " she said			2
i stopped chopping basil and looked over at her			2
" it 's very embarrassing for me , " she said , and i saw tears well in her eyes			1
@entity5 is an extremely honest person , often quite blunt			1
for the most part , i truly appreciate that kind of honesty , and so i 'm willing to suffer whatever consequences may come along with it			2
but i got a little nervous			0
i stood still , waiting			0
i thought she was going to criticize me , and i hoped that i could listen with an open mind and heart			0
instead , what she said , in a very small , tremulous voice , was " i do n't think you liked what i gave you for your birthday			1
" one month earlier , i had celebrated my 60th birthday -- a big one , i think most would agree -- and i had been excited to get @entity5 's gift			1
she 's good at coming up with things you never would have thought of for yourself but instantly love			0
what she gave me was letters i had written her over our many - years - long friendship			0
she had bound them into a book and then done something to every page -- enhanced it with color , with silver sprinkles of confetti , with little candy hearts , with autumn leaves , with rubber stamps of coffee cups , with cutout ads from vintage magazines , with collages of various sorts			0
it was a true work of art , a labor - intensive wonder , and i loved everything about it -- except the person i was in most of those letters			0
@entity0 : how to be a good friend many of the pages represented a time of life when i was desperate and unhappy ; i had written to her of pain and grief and fear and frustration , because she was my dear friend and i needed to talk to her , if not in person , then on paper			0
so when i opened the book , i felt as if i had been given tapes from therapy sessions			0
i felt caught between gratitude and appreciation , and embarrassment and despair			1
i tried to convey my admiration at the time , but @entity5 would have been completely insensitive not to pick up on my ambivalence , and she is anything but insensitive			1
so now , with us alone and in our stocking feet in my kitchen , she told me of her own sadness , of how she had told other friends that i had not liked what she had so earnestly and carefully and creatively done			0
i came over to embrace her , weeping myself			0
i said , " it 's not your gift i did n't like -- it was me i was n't so crazy about			1
" while the ragout simmered on the stove , we talked for some time			0
@entity5 reminded me that at one point she had offered me my letters back and i had told her i did n't want them , but she decided to go ahead and give them to me anyway -- with the best of intentions			1
" i wanted to show you how you had changed , " she said			0
@entity0 : break out of your relationship ruts true enough			0
the person who wrote those letters spent an awful lot of time feeling bad : about herself , about choices she had made , about life in general			0
that person did not look upon planet earth as a particularly good place to be , and in fact had articulated more than once the wish to be done with it all			0
the person i am now may have her share of dreary days -- who does n't ? -- but she is routinely dazzled by the truth of a simple equation : life offers far more good than bad			1
i had placed the gift in my study , in a place hidden from view but close at hand			1
i wanted it to be there whenever i was ready to look at it : to accept it as best i could , until i could accept it fully			0
and some time after my birthday , i found myself paging through @entity5 's gift			1
it was n't a fun read , exactly , but i was surprised by what i found			1
certainly the letters showed how sad i had been , but they also illustrated that even in those dark days i had a pretty dang good sense of humor and a deep love for many things : my children , nature , art , food , the eccentricities and vulnerabilities of people			0
@entity0 : inspiring stories of marriage i told @entity5 that i was sorry for how i had made her feel and that i had n't told her i had come to appreciate the gift			1
we wiped away tears , forgave each other , and freshened our drinks			1
@entity51 's recipe was divine			0
we both kept saying , " man , this is sensational , " then smacking our lips and taking more			0
but the gift @entity5 and i enjoyed that day would never have happened if we had been out in public			1
we needed to be in our stocking feet , comfortable in the way that being in your best friend 's kitchen makes you be			0
i know now that the dictionary definition of ragout is " a richly seasoned stew of meat and vegetables			0
" for me , it will always suggest another kind of mix : a warm kitchen on a winter 's day , an old friend 's candor and absolute trust , and a new friend 's generosity in giving me a recipe , which is always about more than it seems			0
that 's because sharing the things that nourish us helps to fill an empty place			0
sometimes that place is the stomach			0
sometimes it 's the heart			0
and sometimes , the best times , it 's both			0
