-- from the @entity1 to a global economic crisis to the killing of @entity4 , 2011 has been defined by historic and dynamic events that will shape the world in the years ahead			1
a revolt across the @entity8 and @entity9 began with the self - immolation of a struggling merchant in @entity12 and spread across the region			1
@entity15 protesters toppled the 30 - year rule of @entity17 , and rebels in @entity19 battled against supporters of long - time strongman @entity21			1
@entity21 was eventually killed in october after months on the run from rebel forces and @entity25 bombardments			1

from @entity74 to @entity76 residents in august braced for @entity77 , a powerful storm that forecasters feared would cause catastrophic damage			2
the storm weakened before landfall , but it still was blamed for at least 20 deaths in eight states			2
on the battlefield , @entity84 became part of @entity50 military lore when the elite unit raided a compound in @entity90 , killing @entity4 , the leader of @entity91 and the most - wanted terrorist in the world who had orchestrated the terror attacks of 9/11			1
for president @entity96 , the @entity4 raid marked a high point of his presidency			1
sometimes considered soft on terror , @entity96 achieved something his predecessor failed to do : bring the terror mastermind to justice			2

meanwhile , @entity141 presidential candidates looked to seize their campaign to retake the @entity143 in 2012			0
in october , former vp candidate @entity144 and @entity146 gov. @entity145 disappointed supporters by saying they would n't run , and by early december the @entity141 field seemed to be down to two serious contenders : @entity150 and @entity151			0
