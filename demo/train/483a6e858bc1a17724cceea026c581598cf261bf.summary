-- as a former @entity3 brigade commander of several thousand coalition forces during surge operations in @entity6 , it is difficult to watch this country fall apart			1
when i came home in 2007 after 15 months in @entity11 province , i answered questions about what we accomplished there by explaining that we sowed stability and the seeds of self - governance in an @entity20 country that holds significant strategic interest for the @entity3 now , as the @entity3 commits to targeted airstrikes on top of the troops we sent last month to shore up the weakened country , i question everything			1
were the losses my command suffered in the volatile @entity11 province in 2006 - 07 worth it ? how is it possible that the @entity6 military , well - trained to take over security duties , has performed so poorly ? seven years ago , i would have agreed with the decision to return to @entity6			1
today , i feel different			0
we fought long and hard , spending over $ 25 billion to train and equip @entity6 security forces			1
we helped them develop a working government based on democratic principles			0
and while it might be wholly appropriate for the @entity3 to provide humanitarian aid to those under siege , it 's the responsibility of the @entity6 to protect @entity6			1
as someone who helped train these forces , i know they have the capability to stand and fight			1
the training wheels have to come off			1
while it is frustrating and painful to watch militants take over a third of the country , we must focus on the here and now			1
the responsibility is to our soldiers who spent 13 years at war accomplishing what they were asked to do , often at a great cost			2
i fought to help my @entity6 friends and fellow soldiers establish a rule of law , and we achieved remarkable results			1
civilian casualties fell from an estimated 29,380 in 2006 to 4,153 in 2011			0
in @entity11 province , we went from 1,500 violent acts a month to less than 250			0
what is happening now should not detract from that success			0
but i came home to my family , my neighbors and my community			0
we can not let the chaos in @entity6 increase the disconnect between a war - weary @entity3 public and those veterans working through their transition back home			1
the needs in @entity6 evolved over time , and they did n't disappear when we left			1
this is also the case with the needs of our @entity6 - and @entity85 - era veterans and military families			1
i worry about the future of those who served in these wars five or 10 years down the road when the wars have receded from the minds of the @entity3 people			2
at a time when the need will be greatest , interest will diminish , and they may struggle in a peacetime status quo			2
we need to focus on this generation , which has spent more than a decade at war			2
the @entity101 projects the number of veterans from recent conflicts to jump by 26 % by 2016			2
they want to contribute in the same way to their communities as they did in @entity6 and @entity85			2
but even with thousands of organizations operating to help them , a 2012 report from the @entity110 finds that veterans are not receiving the care and services they need to transition successfully			0
they must have a chance to thrive where they live			0
this means education to transition beyond battlefield knowledge to private - sector careers and meaningful employment that pulls in a family wage			0
along with their families , they require options for wellness and services			0
caring for them includes understanding : listening to their service stories and future ambitions			0
adm. @entity135 , 17th chairman of the @entity136 , said , " if you listen closely to the voices of our veterans , you understand that yes , they all returned from war changed , but what never changed is this : they never forgot your generosity			0
they never forgot the power of opportunity			0
they never forgot the @entity3 dream			2
" as much as it pains me to see @entity6 reverting to chaos , that does not mean that we should turn our focus there anew			1
we now have a stake in supporting the future in front of us : the evolving needs of the phenomenal , confident and self - assured men and women who served in and out of combat for these many years .			0

@entity167 , @entity3 brigade commander in @entity6 , says it 's hard to watch country fall apart
as @entity3 begins airstrikes , he questions whether terrible losses from @entity174 are worth it
he says @entity3 spent $ 25 billion to train @entity6 forces . it 's time to take off the training wheels
@entity167 : we need to focus on our own veterans , who have many needs unmet
