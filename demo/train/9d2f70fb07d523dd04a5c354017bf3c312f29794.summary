@entity0 -- president @entity3 's assertion of executive privilege ahead of a hearing before a @entity6 , which subsequently recommended his attorney general be cited for contempt of @entity9 , sets up a fight that has had mixed results in the past			1
at stake are @entity15 documents relating to the flawed @entity17 gunrunning sting that @entity19 chairman @entity18 , @entity20 , wants in his hands , and that attorney general @entity22 says are confidential			0
the @entity24 move means the @entity15 can withhold the documents from the committee , which recommended by a 23 - 17 vote wednesday that @entity22 be cited for contempt			0
the full @entity24 is expected to consider the motion next week			0
more details : @entity24 panel recommends contempt citation if it votes to issue a contempt citation , a statement of facts would be delivered to the @entity36 in the @entity0 , " whose duty it shall be to bring the matter before the grand jury for its action , " according to the law governing contempt citations			1
executive privilege also has been around since the earliest days of the country , and gives the executive branch the ability to withhold certain internal discussions and documents from scrutiny			1
" it 's there to give the executive branch some breathing room for its own deliberations , " said @entity51 , professor of law at @entity52			1
executive privilege " has a long history , but it often plays out very differently , " he said			1
the last major confrontation over executive privilege also involved the @entity15 , but the partisan roles were reversed			1
@entity63 : what 's going on and what comes next in 2007 , president @entity66 insisted that white house counsel @entity68 and @entity24 chief of staff @entity67 would n't testify under oath or provide subpoenaed information about the firings of nine @entity36 attorneys , a controversy that had led to the resignation of attorney general @entity75 the year before			1
@entity24 @entity76 , who were in the majority at the time , believed the firings were politically motivated and wanted to force the pair to testify about them			1
the @entity24 voted 223 - 32 to cite @entity68 and @entity67 for contempt ( most @entity85 members walked out in protest ) , but when @entity9 sued the pair , the case never made it to court			1
it was settled between the two sides with mixed results : the @entity24 got some of the testimony it wanted , but not until 2009 , when @entity3 was in office			0
the real aim of @entity9 had been to get oversight of the @entity66 administration , but he had already left the @entity24 when the information was made available , @entity51 said			1
historically , presidents ' claims of executive privilege rarely have been accepted by @entity9			1
when power brokers from those two branches clash , it is often left to political expediency or the courts to sort out the competing interests			0
@entity109 , author of a book on the @entity111 , " @entity108 , " said that when such a " showdown among two co-equal branches of government " occurs , " the judiciary often becomes the referee			2
" @entity117 : tell us what you think the claim arises from the constitutional idea of separation of powers			0
the concept is not a settled legal precept , since it has been open to varying interpretations , and it remains a controversial , litigated part of government business			0
" the main factor that courts usually use is internal deliberations , " said @entity1 senior legal analyst @entity130			0
" the courts want to respect the president 's internal deliberations so he can get freely given advice from his aides			2
they do n't want to invade that privilege			2
however , that 's not an absolute privilege for everything that goes on in the @entity24			2
" constitutional groundwork the @entity36 @entity145 does not expressly mention this idea of executive privilege			1
president @entity148 set the precedent in 1796 when he refused a @entity24 request for documents relating to how the @entity152 with @entity153 was negotiated			1
the @entity111 first decided the issue in 1807 , during @entity156 's separate trial for treason			1
chief justice @entity158 ordered president @entity159 to produce a letter that might have exonerated the former vice president			2
the court concluded the @entity164 right of compulsory process did not exempt the executive branch			2
the letter was turned over , but its contents never were publicly revealed , at @entity159 's insistence			2
as may ultimately prove to be the case in the @entity17 controversy , the @entity156 issue was privately negotiated , without a subpoena being issued			1
the high court has not spoken with one voice on executive privilege			1
in 1927 , it ruled that the executive branch was not protected from " legitimate " outside investigations			2
in 1948 , presidential prerogatives were preserved in relation to private lawsuits where national security or military matters are involved			0
executive privilege claims have risen sharply since the 1950s , but most presidents since @entity187 have assured @entity9 that such claims would only be asserted with their personal approval , as @entity22 indicated @entity3 did in this case			1
of @entity192 and task forces the biggest recent executive privilege case was @entity194 v. @entity195 in 1974 , during the @entity192 crisis			1
that involved a criminal grand jury subpoena for the president to turn over secretly recorded @entity201 audiotapes			2
the justices unanimously ruled against his legal claims , saying there was great national interest that the tapes be produced			0
nevertheless , for the first time the @entity111 recognized the constitutional basis for executive privilege			1
" nowhere in the @entity145 ... is there any explicit reference to a privilege of confidentiality , " that ruling said , " yet to the extent this interest relates to the effective discharge of a president 's powers , it is constitutionally based			1
" the court then recognized that " those who expect public dissemination of their remarks may well temper candor with a concern for appearances and for their interest , to the detriment of the decision - making process			0
" in other words , the @entity111 laid out a balancing test of sorts : a basic need for executive confidentiality and candor , weighed against the public interests of congressional oversight , a criminal inquiry or prosecution			1
president @entity243 's first term produced an interesting legal dilemma that later popped in subsequent administrations			2
then - first lady @entity246 chaired a health care task force that was sued for closing to the public several meetings with government and private officials			0
the issue was whether she as the first lady was a government employee and therefore could claim executive privilege			1
a federal appeals court concluded she could			0
the issue emerged again in 2001 , when vice president @entity257 was sued for his role chairing an energy task force			0
only this time the issue was whether executive privilege applied to conversations by @entity24 officials with those outside the government			1
@entity257 was taken to court by private groups and the @entity268 seeking information on what energy company officials and lobbyists might have advised the group , whose conclusions later formed the basis of the administration 's energy policy			0
a lawsuit claimed those contacts improperly benefited private energy businesses			0
the private lawsuit reached the @entity111 after two years of legal wrangling , and the @entity24 won a temporary victory			2
justice @entity284 wrote , " special considerations applicable to the president and the vice president suggest that the courts should be sensitive to requests by the government " in such appeals			0
the government claimed in its legal brief that it is " clear that the president 's authority to receive opinions from executive officers is not subject to interference from or control by other branches " of government			1
the case was sent back to the lower courts and , after about five years , was settled without the government turning over the requested documents			0
the foreseeable future and beyond time may be on the side of the @entity24 , if it is determined to see this issue played out in the courts			0
the case could take many months , or even years , to be resolved			0
the use of contempt measures or executive privileges can blur the line between law and politics			0
@entity9 benefits from having the @entity17 controversy viewed as an issue of tremendous national importance , and from affirming the power of the legislature to serve as a check on the executive			1
it has not been shy invoking the threat of subpoenas			0
administration supporters have countered that the request for documents by the @entity85 - led oversight committee amounts to election - year politics , with the goal of embarrassing @entity3			0
the president has two centuries of precedent to rely upon , and no clear sign the courts want to resolve the issue with some bedrock finality			0
" the executive branch is taking the long - term view of this , " said legal analyst @entity109			0
" you need to develop golden rules in this situation that will apply regardless of who is in power , to come up with a fair way to hold the president accountable without unduly chilling speech with the executive branch			2
" @entity22 contempt vote could come next week			0

executive privilege is often invoked by the president but rarely accepted by @entity9
differing circumstances have led to a *mishmash* of @entity111 rulings over time
early cases involved the @entity152 of 1796 and @entity156 's trial for treason in 1807
most recent case involved the firings of @entity36 attorneys by @entity66 in 2007
