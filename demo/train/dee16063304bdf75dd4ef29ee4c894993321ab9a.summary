@entity0 -- a federal air marshal fired after revealing the government was cutting back air marshal coverage at a time of heightened hijacking concern has lost a major battle in his fight to reclaim his job			1
a federal panel , upholding a decision by an administrative judge , said this week it has ruled the @entity15 's decision to fire @entity16 was legal and " did not exceed the bounds of reasonableness			1
" the @entity19 said it accepted @entity16 's statements he was motivated by a desire to protect the flying public , but said his leak " could have created a significant security risk			1
" further , it said , @entity16 can not claim whistle - blower protections because his disclosure " was specifically prohibited by law			0
" @entity16 said he will appeal the decision			1
the case began in july of 2003 , when @entity16 , an air marshal based in @entity32 , @entity33 , anonymously tipped off an @entity35 reporter that the @entity15 was temporarily suspending missions that would require marshals to stay in hotels -- basically taking them off coast - to - coast or overseas flights -- just days after air marshals were briefed about a new " potential plot " to hijack @entity46 airliners			1
the agency planned the cutback because it was running out of money at the end of the fiscal year			0
the news caused an immediate uproar on @entity54 and the @entity15 retreated , withdrawing the scheduling cuts before they went into effect			0
a year later , @entity16 appeared on " @entity57 " -- in disguise and identified only as " air marshal ' @entity59 ' " -- to criticize the agency 's dress policy , which , he said , made it easier for terrorists to identify the undercover air marshals			1
but someone from the @entity15 recognized @entity16 's voice and the agency ordered an investigation into @entity16 for an " unauthorized media appearance			1
" during that investigation , @entity16 admitted he leaked the information to the media about the 2003 suspension of long - distance flights			1
the agency fired @entity16 , saying his leak was an unauthorized disclosure of " sensitive security information , " or @entity79			1
@entity16 's case has become celebrated by whistle - blower advocates and government watchdog groups			0
rep. @entity83 , @entity84 , and rep. @entity85 , @entity84 - @entity86 , filed a brief on his behalf			0
supporters argue @entity16 brought to public light a @entity15 action that violated federal law , which mandates the agency give priority to flights that present high security risks , specifically mentioning " nonstop , long - distance flights			1
" they say the information he gave was factual and that it ultimately protected passengers by changing a flawed policy			0
in court filings , @entity16 argued the information he disclosed was not protected			2
the @entity15 had sent the information to him as a text message on his cell phone , instead of as an encrypted message on his password - protected pager			2
and it was not labeled @entity79			0
indeed , it was three years later -- in august of 2006 -- that the @entity15 officially issued an order classifying the directive as " sensitive security information			2
" @entity16 argued his firing in retaliation for union activities , and the agency discriminated against him by imposing a harsher penalty than it imposed against others who had disclosed sensitive information			2
but the @entity19 said that even if the scheduling directive was not labeled @entity79 , deployment information was " within the definition of @entity79			0
" @entity16 " admittedly knew that he was not permitted to tell anyone about ( air marshal ) scheduling , yet he did so anyway , and it could have created a significant security risk , " the board said			1
the board said there is " no direct evidence " the agency retaliated or discriminated against @entity16 for his union activities			2
it confirmed the @entity15 treated other air marshals less harshly for disclosing information , but said the circumstances were different			2
the board notes that @entity16 raised his concerns with his supervisor and with the agency 's inspector general 's office and was not satisfied with the response he received			0
but @entity16 did not take his complaint to an authorized committee of @entity143 , nor to the @entity144 , and thereby was not entitled to whistle - blower protection , the board ruled			0
@entity16 said the board ruling will have a chilling effect on whistle - blowers if it is allowed to stand			0
" if front - line , non-intelligence government employees can not disclose wrongdoing to the public that was never classified and then that information can be stamped years later with an unclassified @entity15 marking , the @entity149 is now meaningless , " he said .			0

air marshal @entity16 tipped the media off to a cutback in schedules
he was fired after the @entity15 found out he was the one who leaked the information
the merit board says the leak " could have created a significant security risk "
@entity16 says he will appeal the decision
