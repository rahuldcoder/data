-- climate skeptics are indicative of societies in decay			1
so said @entity4 , president of the @entity5			1
speaking at @entity0 's @entity7 's @entity6 in @entity8 , @entity4 said he was looking for a greater urgency from countries and business across the world in dealing with the problems caused by climate change			1
rather than a slow decay , @entity4 's own nation is faced with a rapid extinction caused by a rise in sea - levels , according to many climate scientists			1
joined at the debate by filmmaker and environmentalist @entity21 , @entity23 's ceo @entity22 , and @entity24 of @entity25 , @entity4 noted what was at stake when talking about future energy sources			1
" i think it 's going to be very difficult for the @entity5 to survive if business goes as usual , " he said			1
" i think it 's time especially for big emitter countries to find alternatives and move forward			1
if not , it 's not just going to be the @entity5 , it 's going to be all of us			1
" instead of revisiting the divisions that flared between countries at the @entity42 climate summit in december , @entity4 struck a more inclusive tone on how countries can work together to create a carbon - neutral future			1
" i do n't think this is an issue of developed and developing countries			0
given the opportunities , ( developing countries ) would have done the same			0
" but of course industrialized countries have more capabilities and more means , and there are people who are in trouble			0
if they want to lend a hand , that 's the decent thing to do			2
" @entity22 took a stand for businesses taking the initiative in promoting renewable energy by saying that business can not wait for government action			1
" we ca n't wait for the perfect solutions			0
it 's trial and error , " he said			2
@entity23 has a carbon neutral hq in @entity71 and two of its factories operate off - grid			1
@entity22 said he was committed to fostering responsible businesses			2
" if you plan your business out for the long run , you have to plan with renewable energies and eliminate carbon footprints			2
business ultimately has caused a lot of the environmental degradation we see around the world , so business is there to also fix it , " he said			0
a number of solutions that balance energy production and environmental protection exist , but the panel took different stands over a particular hydroelectric damn project in the @entity98 state of @entity99 @entity21 had recently visited the region to campaign against the dam , but as a a head of state immediately threatened by rising sea - levels , @entity4 took a different view			1
" reducing the amount of carbon in the atmosphere is the priority right now , " he said			0
" if @entity98 does that through damming their rivers , i would say , go ahead and do it			0
i think a number of countries are unable to understand the mathematics of the whole issue			0
if we can not become carbon - neutral by mid-century , then we wo n't be around here			0
it 's as simple as that			2
" @entity22 disagreed : " you have to look at carbon holistically			0
we live in a connected world where conservation , community , culture all have to play together , " he said			0
@entity24 touched upon @entity128 's position as the world 's largest emitter of greenhouse gases as well as its biggest investor in renewable energy projects			1
" no matter how much @entity128 invests today , it 's not just a one country issue			2
more importantly we need to work together in order to deal with the core issue , " she said			0
ultimately that core issue for @entity21 was getting a greater consensus that climate change itself was a serious , global problem			1
" the fundamental problem out there is how many people ( do n't ) actually believe there 's a problem , " he said			1
" the most powerful force on the planet right now is the ability of individuals to communicate with each other			0
i believe in the power of ideas			0
people can certainly make a difference in the way they live , if they 're motivated			0
the important thing is to get the ideas out there			0
" what do you think ? should governments or businesses be doing more ? use the soundoff box , below , to have your say and send an @entity168 to show how you are going off - grid .			2

president @entity4 of @entity5 wants more help and action in coping with climate change
@entity23 's ceo thinks businesses should lead in drive towards renewable energy
@entity21 believes climate skepticism is still a great problem
