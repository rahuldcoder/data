-- comatose for seven years , @entity2 's iconic former prime minister @entity1 is showing " significant brain activity			1
" the 84 - year - old suffered a devastating stroke january 4 , 2006 , and a brain hemorrhage			0
he was presumed to be in a vegetative state			0
but on monday , a team of surprised neuroscientists and doctors said @entity1 's brain appeared to respond when they showed him pictures of his family and had him listen to his son 's voice			1
doctors also used tactile stimuli to measure @entity1 's reaction			1
does this mean the man @entity2 once dubbed the " @entity23 " could wake ? doctors urge caution			2
from the archives : sculpture of @entity1 in coma to go on show in @entity2 @entity1 was considered one of @entity2 's finest military commanders of all time and was involved with nearly every major conflict between @entity2 and its @entity35 neighbors			1
from the ' 70s to the ' 90s , he encouraged the building of @entity2 settlements in the @entity40 and @entity41			2
he was a top leader in the @entity42 for 15 years and prime minister from 2001 to 2006			1
" the two great tragedies in modern @entity47 politics , which make you wonder if @entity49 wants @entity47 peace or not , were ( @entity53 ) @entity52 's assassination and ( @entity55 ) @entity1 's stroke , " president @entity44 remarked in 2011			1
@entity1 has missed seven years of rising and falling tensions in the @entity47 , including election victories by @entity58 in the @entity40			2
a revolutionary movement known as the @entity60 took root in @entity62 in 2010 and spread to @entity63 in 2011 , toppling decades - old regimes and furthering democratic ideals in the @entity47 and @entity66			0
@entity1 brain results not proof he 'll wake up how would @entity1 react if he knew that a war in @entity71 , which is supported in part by @entity2 's enemy iran , has been raging for nearly two years ? doctors tested @entity1 like this : they would show him pictures of random houses , which he would not be expected to know , and then a picture of his own house			1
when the images of his own home were shown , areas of his brain " lit up " with activity			2
doctors then had @entity1 's son speak into a device that turned the words into gibberish			1
those sounds did n't register in @entity1 's brain the same way as when his son actually spoke to him using real words			1
" we know that he can process pictures -- pictures of faces , " said dr. @entity98 of @entity99			0
" and he can even differentiate between pictures of faces and pictures of houses , pictures of his family to other objects			2
he can differentiate between words that were spoken to him by his son , compared to a noise			0
" @entity1 's brain activity was " encouraging " but " subtle , " according to a release from @entity2 's @entity117 , which conducted the tests last week			1
they were administered by a team of @entity122 and @entity2 scientists			2
doctors are still trying to understand precisely what the results indicate			0
" but it does n't mean he 's going to sit up tomorrow and start speaking with his family , " said @entity0 senior medical correspondent @entity126			0
" it just means that things that are familiar to him are just registering in his brain in some way			0
" @entity135 , head of medical imaging at @entity117 said the test " does n't mean there is a very high process of interpretation " in @entity1 's brain			1
" we are not sure about it , " @entity135 said			0
" what we know for sure ( is that ) there was a significant metabolic response to these stimuli			0
" when two conscious people are speaking to each other , he explained , their brains are naturally reacting			0
it 's unclear why someone in @entity1 's state would respond like that , he said			1
he cautions against being overly optimistic			0
" we know that he is in a very bad situation for many years , " @entity135 said			0
it 's impossible to know whether the test shows that @entity1 's condition is improving because , experts say , the test was not performed earlier in @entity1 's coma			1
so there 's nothing with which to compare these most recent results			0
it is " a comfort , " he said , to @entity1 's family that it seems they 've reached him , but they should keep in mind that it 's unclear what that means right now			1
the news about @entity1 has reminded the world of his legacy and that it still looms large in @entity2			1
as minister of defense in 1982 , he orchestrated @entity2 's invasion of @entity182 , a military operation that killed hundreds of @entity182 civilians as @entity2 forces sought to wipe out @entity187 fighters in the region			2
his visit in september 2000 to a holy site in @entity191 -- known to @entity192 as the @entity193 and to @entity194 as the @entity193 -- set off clashes between @entity196 and @entity2 that developed into the @entity197 , or uprising			0
several months later , voters elected him as prime minister by the largest margin of victory in @entity2 history			1
in 2003 , he held talks with @entity196 officials about the @entity122 - led " road map to peace " that called for the eventual creation of a @entity196 state			0
he broke from the right - wing party @entity42 in november 2005 to form a centrist political party , @entity210 , which means " forward " in @entity211			0
final @entity2 election results show divided voters			2

doctors showed @entity1 pictures of his family and used other stimuli
@entity1 's brain showed activity , but doctors warn against too much optimism
doctors still trying to figure out what results mean
@entity1 was a divisive figure in @entity2 politics during his time as prime minister
