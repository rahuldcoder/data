@entity0 , @entity1 -- nestled among the lush forests of @entity0 , near the hill town of @entity5 , is one of the island 's most remarkable villages			1
it 's not just that each of the 18 homes of @entity12 is constructed almost entirely from bamboo , but the form they take			1
from vast spiral staircases to a river - spanning bridge leading to the door of the newest house , the designs are more akin to luxury mansions than jungle huts			1
the exclusive abodes are part of creative director @entity25 's masterplan for sustainable , luxury living			1
as the daughter of @entity28 -- who set up @entity0 's @entity29 to educate a new generation of environmentally responsible students -- she and her team of designers and architects are also committed to changing common perceptions of what sustainability means			1
" the first step ( for us ) is to create sustainable luxury living and different a mindset , " says @entity12 architect @entity37			1

while some families live in the village , some homes are luxury retreats and can cost between $ 500,000 and $ 2million			0
the latest and largest structure lies on the other side of the river with its five stories towering above the forest canopy			0
lucky guests traverse a glass and bamboo bridge to reach the villa 's front door , itself a revolving glass oval			1
clever design and roll - down shutters help protect those inside from rainstorms , while banana paper for interior walls and some aluminum for roofing are generally the only concessions to non-bamboo materials			2
simplicity then is a key design element but it has n't restricted some non-organic basics , with electricity and high - end kitchen fittings standard throughout the buildings			1
@entity37 's next project is to build a house with a 15 - meter roof span -- twice as big as the largest so far -- and without any central columns			1

it 's pure architecture ... to breathe fresh air and touch nature , that 's everything			2
" much like any other house anywhere , some running repairs have to be made on small non-structural pieces of the homes			0
but the largest structural bamboo logs could last a lifetime , says @entity109 , the chief builder from the nearby bamboo factory			0
" we treat each piece of bamboo with a mixture of water and boric acid to stop fungus and insects			0
before doing this a bamboo structure would last only seven years , now we 're not sure how long a building can last			0
" around 200 farmers across the island are paid to grow bamboo on areas of their land not used for agriculture			0
some of the largest logs are 25 meters long but only take 3 years to grow			0
the angle of the main structural logs is also important to minimize the impact of direct sun and rain , which can weaken them			0
but the magnificent designs show another side of bamboo that those connected to the project , like operational director @entity140 , hope will be a greater legacy			2
" many people still think bamboo is cheap and only for small buildings , but we 're showing it can be used to make high houses and really redefine how the material is used			2
