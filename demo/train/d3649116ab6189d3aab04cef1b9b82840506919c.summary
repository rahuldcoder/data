-- the ever - popular @entity2 series " @entity3 " is rarely thought of as a workplace show , but if we take a closer look , we can see it is riddled with workplace clichés			1
@entity8 , our main gal , somehow makes an extravagant living from one weekly newspaper column she often writes in her underwear while smoking what seems to be a smokeless cigarette inside her @entity15 apartment			2
@entity17 , a " busy " corporate lawyer never seems too busy for lunches , parties , shopping or long walks around the city with best pal @entity8			0
@entity23 is a museum curator who rarely curates anything but her obsession with finding mr. @entity27 and having mr. @entity28 , but certainly not least in any sense of the word , @entity29 is a successful public relations practitioner despite a reputation the size of @entity15 itself			0
recently , over on the humor website , @entity38 , one writer was fed up with the annoying clichés about women that keep popping up in movies			1
tired of seeing gorgeous actresses playing the supposedly unattractive sister and an unrealistic emphasis on the glories of shopping , @entity43 penned " 6 obnoxious assumptions @entity50 makes about women			1
" the list is not only funny but also accurate if you stop and think about how many movies these annoying tropes occur in			1
it also got us thinking that @entity50 's not just inaccurately portraying women in movies or on tv -- it 's off the mark about what it 's like for the average worker in today 's economy			1
as a result , we bring you 6 ways @entity50 lies to us about the workplace ... 1			1
all the beautiful people ever notice all the long - legged , luscious haired , model - types walking around your office ? what about all of the strapping , buff and impeccably dressed men ? we did n't think so			0
@entity50 can often make it seem like unattractive , overweight or simple - humored people do n't work			1
skills ? who needs ' em , right ? as long as you look good and utter funny , clever remarks all day , you 're bound to grow business and make bushels of money			0
sure statistics exist regarding attractive people getting hired over , promoted instead of or paid more than unattractive ones , but these people also have skills , education or the ability to move business in some significant way			0
a pretty face might help , but if that 's all you got , it 's not going to cut it in the real world			0
@entity50 examples : @entity103 , @entity104 , @entity105 2			1
executives work ? nah ... the @entity118 movie " @entity108 " in which she plays the role of an international fund manager , wife and mother , portrays an unrealistic schedule for such an executive - level job			1
@entity119 , author of fiction , memoir and literary criticism says , " no way , no way , no way , would an international fund manager get into work at 9 a.m. she would be working around the clock with her terminal from home			1
she would n't have time to shoot snarky emails to her female work mates			2
my pals who are traders ca n't talk to me on the phone and can only send the shortest texts			0
" @entity139 , a marketer , creative director and author based in @entity142 , @entity138 believes @entity50 portrays executives and entrepreneurs as " rich , uncaring crooks who made their fortunes by stepping on the regular people			1
" @entity148 , having worked for @entity149 and @entity150 , looks down on this cliché , noting " both were great entrepreneurs who built their businesses with vision and tenacity , and are good people			0
" @entity50 examples : you 've got mail , @entity160 , @entity161 3			1
your outfit ? anything goes ! a suit ? slacks ? minimal cleavage ? that 's crazy talk			2
according to @entity50 , club wear is quite suitable for the workplace , and even welcome			1
how else do you plan to get that big promotion or spark up that all - appropriate office romance ? @entity180 , marketing academic , career coach and co-editor of " start your internet business : 36 things you need to know " says , " while @entity184 are changing a lot of things about the way we dress in the workplace , the reality is there is still a level of professionalism expected , and usually , that is n't reflected in ' britney-esque ' outfits			2
" @entity180 cautions you should always remember who your boss is			0
" they 're not likely to appreciate you wearing club wear to the office meeting			0
and even more likely -- they wo n't take you seriously			0
" @entity50 examples : my @entity196 , @entity198 , legally blonde 4			1
work is so easy " the common [ so - called ' webpreneurial ' ] storyline on tv shows or movies goes like this : person gets idea ; they set up a website ; next day money is rolling in , " says @entity180			1
citing another unrealistic example , she adds , " crime scene investigators strategically hold up flashlights , miraculously evidence appears			0
the reality is @entity214 across the country are n't exactly running around in @entity217 shoes			0
csi work is hard , and many crime labs are not nearly as well equipped as the ones you see on tv			2
" on tv and in movies , people make more witty remarks than they complete important projects			2
they hang out all day , barely ever sitting at a computer or on a phone call			0
pranks are a regular part of the work day , and talking to the boss in the same way you talk to your poker buddies is acceptable			2
in today 's economy , it 's hard to imagine anyone 's workday is that carefree			0
@entity50 examples : @entity240 , @entity241 , @entity242 , @entity243 5			1
money is no object would n't it be nice to live in a movie or tv sitcoms where you can be an out of work - actor , waitress or writer and still live in a lavish @entity15 apartment , buy $ 500 @entity255 , sip on warm delights in a coffee shop all day , and barely ever go to work ? tv shows like " friends " and " @entity3 , " and characters like @entity260 , @entity261 and @entity8 give us the false hope that we can actually work little and live a lot			2
in a post-recession economy , many workers are deciding how often they can afford to buy coffee each week , but you do n't see that on tv			2
@entity50 examples : the @entity271 , @entity272 , @entity273 [ of any city ] , @entity275 6			1
your boss is a horrible person and / or an idiot you 've probably had a boss that was n't the brightest bulb or even the nicest person you 've ever met , but he or she was n't necessarily worthless			0
in fact , unless you 've had an unfortunate run of luck , your bosses probably ranged from ok people to great leaders			0
your average @entity50 bosses , however , either exist to make your life miserable with outrageous demands and endless piles of work , or they 're incompetent fools who can barely tie their own shoes much less manage a team			1
" while there are always going to be bosses who are -- " clueless " -- [ it 's ] not a good idea to point that out to them , " says @entity180			0
" worse , do n't make how you -- " feel they are clueless " -- obvious in front of others			0
" @entity50 examples : @entity308 , @entity309 , nine to five why it matters " the shame is , many teens and 20 - somethings base career choices on what they see on tv , and tv just is n't a great career counselor because shows are n't meant to do that , " says @entity180			1
" tv and movies are entertainment			2
they are geared for a shorter attention span , and to use elements of truth to propel a storyline forward			0
" while work can be fun , and some companies might have a more informal working environment than others , you might not want to model your workplace behavior after what you see on tv and in movies			1

@entity50 often misrepresents careers and the workplace in movies
work is portrayed as easy or *non-existent* , and any outfit is appropriate
this can have a *negative* effect on younger *generations* deciding on careers
