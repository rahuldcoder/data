but @entity40 , who removed the dangerous @entity93 to end his opening stand of 46 with @entity64 , took a string of late wickets to end with five wickets for 48			0
that put a brake on the @entity101 batsmen , who had threatened to amass in excess of 350 and take the game out of @entity2 's reach			1
