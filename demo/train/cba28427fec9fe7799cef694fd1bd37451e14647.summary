@entity0 -- in the past few weeks , we 've seen a @entity4 soldier hacked to death with a meat cleaver on the streets of @entity8 and bombers blowing up spectators at the @entity11			1
on the surface , terrorism is alive and well			0
so how should the @entity14 react to these continuing threats ? for the first time on thursday , president @entity16 laid out the full scope of his proposed counterterrorism strategy , and it boiled down to this : @entity22 's endless war on terror is over			1
and that 's appropriate , since the enemy @entity22 went to war with after september 11 has largely been defeated			1
@entity16 's speech at the @entity28 in @entity0 was designed to lay the political groundwork to wind down @entity14 's longest war , the war that began when @entity31 destroyed the @entity32 and a wing of the @entity34 12 years ago			1
thursday 's speech was the first time @entity16 had delivered an overarching framework for how to conceptualize the conflict that has defined @entity14 national security policy since 9/11			1
other speeches by @entity16 have focused on aspects of that conflict , such as @entity43 and the @entity45 war			2
but no speech has made such an expansive examination of the war against @entity31 and its allies in all its manifestations , from drone strikes to detention policies to a clear - eyed assessment of the scope of the threats posed by @entity31 and its affiliates , as well as by those " homegrown " extremists who attacked the @entity11 in april			0
much of the coverage of the speech has centered on the measures the president outlined to impose greater constraints on @entity64 drone strikes and to try to hasten the eventual closing of @entity43			0
but the most significant aspect of the speech was the president 's case that the " perpetual wartime footing " and " boundless war on terror " that has permeated so much of @entity14 life since 9/11 should come to an end			1
@entity16 argued that the time has come to redefine the kind of conflict that the @entity14 is engaged in : " we must define the nature and scope of this struggle , or else it will define us			2
" this is why the president focused part of his speech on a discussion of the seemingly arcane authorization for the @entity88 that @entity89 passed days after 9/11 and that gave @entity22 the authority to go to war in @entity45 against @entity31 and its @entity93 allies			1
few , if any , in @entity89 who voted for the authorization understood at the time that they were voting for a virtual blank check that has provided the legal basis for more than a decade of war			0
it is a war that has expanded in recent years to other countries in the @entity103 and @entity104 , such as @entity105 and @entity106 , where the @entity14 has engaged in covert military operations against @entity31 - affiliated groups			2
theoretically , when @entity14 combat troops finally withdraw from @entity45 in december 2014 , the authorization should simply expire , and the nation will no longer be at war			0
after all , once combat operations are over in @entity45 , why would you want to keep in place an authorization for a permanent war ? however , there are now some in @entity89 who would like to expand the scope of the @entity87 for the @entity88 beyond its present parameters to include military operations against terrorist groups that were not involved in the 9/11 attacks , which could prolong @entity14 's wars indefinitely and add additional terrorist groups to the @entity14 ' list of enemies it is at war with			1
@entity14 sen. @entity131 , @entity132 , ranking member of the influential @entity133 , for instance , last month called for an expansion of the scope of the authorization			0
@entity16 made it quite clear in his thursday speech that he would oppose such an expansion , saying he hopes instead to " ultimately repeal the @entity141 's mandate			2
and i will not sign laws designed to expand this mandate further			0
" in short , @entity16 intends to end a seemingly endless war			1
that 's because , according to @entity16 , " the core of @entity31 in @entity45 and @entity147 is on the path to defeat			0
their remaining operatives spend more time thinking about their own safety than plotting against us			0
" on thursday , @entity16 asserted ( in my view , correctly ) that what remains of the terrorist threat , while significant and persistent , is nothing on the scale of the @entity31 organization that launched the 9/11 operation and instead consists of " less capable @entity31 affiliates , threats to diplomatic facilities and businesses abroad , homegrown extremists			0
" these threats , the president further asserted , can be managed by carefully targeted drone strikes overseas and efforts to counter extremist ideology at home and do not require some kind of broader war			0
@entity16 is also looking to his legacy and the presidents who will follow him and is trying to begin to create the public consensus and legal framework that will help to ensure that the @entity14 is n't " drawn into more wars we do n't need to fight , or continue to grant presidents unbound powers more suited for traditional armed conflicts between nation states			2
" @entity16 clearly hopes to leave office in 2016 as the commander in chief who finally ended @entity14 's longest war .			1

terrorism has been in the news with @entity192 bombing and killing of @entity4 soldier in the street
@entity197 says despite recent acts , the enemy behind 9/11 has been defeated
he says president @entity16 signaled he wants @entity22 's endless war on terror to end
@entity206 : *key* part of @entity16 speech was idea that @entity14 's perpetual war footing should end
