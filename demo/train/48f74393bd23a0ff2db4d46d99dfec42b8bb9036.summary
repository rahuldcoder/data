@entity1 officials reacted with fury sunday to a report that the @entity4 spied on @entity6 offices			1
the @entity6 warned that if the report is accurate , it will have tremendous repercussions			1
" i am deeply worried and shocked about the allegations , " @entity10 president @entity9 said in a statement			0
" if the allegations prove to be true , it would be an extremely serious matter which will have a severe impact on @entity6 - @entity18 relations			1
on behalf of the @entity10 , i demand full clarification and require further information speedily from the @entity18 authorities with regard to these allegations			1
" @entity31 justice minister @entity30 " said if the accusations were true , it was reminiscent of the @entity26 , " ministry spokesman @entity27 said , adding that the minister " has asked for an immediate explanation from the @entity18			1
" @entity33 foreign minister @entity32 called for a swift explanation from @entity18 authorities			1
" these acts , if they are confirmed , would be absolutely unacceptable , " he said in a statement			0
the outrage from @entity1 officials over the weekend was the latest fallout since @entity41 , a former @entity4 computer contractor , started spilling details of @entity18 surveillance programs to reporters earlier this month			1
citing information from secret documents obtained by @entity41 , the @entity31 news magazine @entity46 reported sunday that several @entity18 spying operations targeted @entity6 leaders			1
@entity46 said it had " in part seen " documents from @entity41 that describe how the @entity4 bugged @entity6 officials ' @entity54 and @entity55 offices and conducted an " electronic eavesdropping operation " that tapped into a @entity6 building in @entity59 , @entity60			1
the magazine 's report also says that @entity4 spying has targeted telephone and internet connection data in @entity31 more than any other @entity1 nation			1
an average of up to 20 million phone connections and 10 million @entity70 data connections are surveyed daily , @entity46 said , noting that the intensity of surveillance puts the @entity18 ally on par with @entity75 , @entity76 and @entity77			1
another report sunday claimed that surveillance extended beyond @entity1 offices			1
the @entity81 newspaper reported that one @entity4 document leaked by @entity41 describes 38 embassies and missions as " targets " and details surveillance methods that include planting bugs in communications equipment and collecting transmissions with specialized antennae			1
targets included @entity33 , @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 , @entity97 and @entity98 , according to @entity81			1
@entity99 has not independently confirmed the allegations in the reports from @entity46 and the @entity81			1
@entity18 officials did not immediately respond to the @entity81 's report			1
the @entity104 declined to comment sunday on specific allegations published in @entity46			1
" the @entity18 government will respond appropriately to the @entity6 through our diplomatic channels , and through the @entity6 / @entity18 experts ' dialogue on intelligence that the @entity18 proposed several weeks ago , " the office said in a statement			1
" we will also discuss these issues bilaterally with @entity6 member states			2
while we are not going to comment publicly on specific alleged intelligence activities , as a matter of policy , we have made clear that the @entity18 gathers foreign intelligence of the type gathered by all nations			1
" @entity122 , @entity123 deputy national security adviser for strategic communications , said he had not seen the report and " would not comment on unauthorized disclosures of intelligence programs			2
the intelligence community would be the most appropriate to do that			0
" @entity122 added that " those are some of our closest intelligence partners , so it 's worth noting that the @entity1 work very closely with us			1
we have very close intelligence relationships with them			0
" father proposes deal for @entity41 's voluntary return @entity18 asks @entity138 to reject any asylum request from @entity41 @entity140 , a former director of the @entity4 and @entity141 , told " @entity144 " on @entity142 on sunday morning that he did n't know whether the report was true			1
" i 've been out of government for about five years , so i really do n't know , and even if i did , i would n't confirm or deny it , " he said			0
" but i think i can confirm a few things for you here this morning			0
number one , the @entity18 does conduct espionage			2
number two , our @entity151 , which protects @entity18 ' privacy , is not an international treaty			2
and number three , any @entity1 who wants to go out and rend their garments with regard to international espionage should look first and find out what their governments are doing			2
" @entity6 spokeswoman @entity165 , in a e-mail to @entity99 , said , " we have immediately been in contact with the @entity18 authorities in @entity54 and in @entity59 and have confronted them with the press reports			1
they have told us they are checking on the accuracy of the information released yesterday and will come back to us			0
" in @entity59 , @entity46 says , the agency targeted the @entity176 , which houses the @entity177 and the @entity178 , the union 's main decision - making and legislative body			1
and in @entity54 , the magazine report claims , the @entity4 installed bugs in the @entity6 's building and infiltrated its computer network			1
@entity46 's report comes as negotiations for a trans - atlantic trade agreement between the @entity18 and the @entity6 are set to start next month in @entity54			1
@entity189 : pay no attention to that man we ca n't capture @entity41 has revealed himself as the source of documents outlining a massive effort by the @entity4 to track cell phone calls and monitor the e-mail and internet traffic of virtually all @entity18			2
critics slam him as a traitor			0
supporters hail him as a hero			0
now @entity41 , who faces espionage charges in the @entity18 , is in @entity204 and seeking asylum from @entity138			2
@entity18 vice president @entity206 asked @entity138 " to please reject " the request for asylum , according to @entity138 president @entity207			2
" that 's not acceptable , " @entity210 founder @entity209 told @entity213 's " @entity212 " on sunday			0
@entity209 , whose organization facilitates the release of classified documents and is assisting @entity41 's asylum bid , said he could n't reveal details about the former @entity4 contractor 's specific location or the status of his case			0
he criticized @entity18 officials for pressuring @entity138 on the matter			2
" asylum is a right that we all have			0
it 's an international right			0
the @entity18 has been founded largely on accepting political refugees from other countries and has prospered by it			2
mr. @entity41 has that right , " said @entity209			0
" ideally , he should be able to return to the @entity18			2
unfortunately , that 's not the world that we live in and hopefully another country will give him the justice that he deserves			0
" former @entity238 leader @entity237 weighed in on sunday			0
in a letter to @entity241 president @entity240 published in @entity238 state media , @entity237 praised @entity138 's president for standing up to @entity18 threats over @entity41			2
on saturday night , @entity207 said the ball was in @entity204 's court			0
" we did n't ask to be in this situation			0
mr. @entity41 has been in touch with mr. @entity209 , who recommended he ask for asylum in @entity138			0
in order to process this request , he needs to be in @entity138 territory , " @entity207 said in an interview with @entity138 's @entity252 on saturday night			0
" at this point , the solution for @entity41 's final destination is in the hands of the @entity204 authorities			0
" @entity204 president @entity261 has said it 's up to @entity41 to figure out his next step			0
" the sooner he selects his final destination point , the better both for us and for himself , " @entity261 said			0
a top @entity204 lawmaker said sunday that @entity204 must not hand @entity41 over to the @entity18			2
" it 's not a matter of @entity41 's usefulness to @entity204 , it 's a matter of principle , " @entity267 -- who heads the international affairs committee at the @entity269 , the lower house of parliament -- said on @entity271			0
" he is a political refugee and handing him over is morally unacceptable , " he said			0
the man behind the @entity4 leaks why we 're all stuck in the digital transit zone with @entity41			0
