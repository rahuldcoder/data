twice - convicted murderer @entity0 was executed tuesday , according to the @entity3 @entity2			1
despite pleas by human rights groups and legal representatives who have argued that @entity0 's intellectual disability should have made him ineligible for the death penalty , @entity0 died by injection at the prison in @entity12 , @entity3			2
his time of death was 7:55 p.m. et , said spokeswoman @entity15			2
@entity0 declined to make a final statement , but requested a final prayer , @entity16 said			2
@entity0 's attorney slammed the @entity21 @entity20 , which declined to step in and grant a stay of execution			1
" today , the court has unconscionably allowed a grotesque miscarriage of justice to occur in @entity3 , " said @entity24 , @entity0 's lawyer			2
" the intellectual disability community , which has strongly supported mr. @entity0 's case for many years , joined his legal team in the belief that the @entity20 would step in and prevent @entity3 's flagrant disregard of the @entity33 on behalf of the rights of people with disabilities , " said @entity24			1
he described the execution as " an abomination			1
" the @entity39 similarly voted to deny clemency			1
the board said in a release that its members " thoroughly reviewed the parole case file on the inmate , which includes the circumstances of the death penalty case , the inmate 's criminal history , and a comprehensive history of the inmate 's life " to reach their decision			1
in a joint statement released tuesday , the @entity55 , the @entity56 on @entity57 , and @entity58 for @entity59 called the board 's decision to deny clemency , " an embarrassment to our state			1
" they condemned the legal system for " failing to protect those who are most vulnerable			0
" the groups invited " those concerned about @entity3 's criminal justice practices , " to join them at vigils in several cities around the state before @entity0 's scheduled execution			1
federal law -- stemming from a 2002 @entity78 case that went to the @entity21 @entity20 -- says executing intellectually disabled individuals violates the @entity81 's ban on cruel and unusual punishment			1
but the ruling also allows states to define intellectual disability			0
in @entity3 , that means attorneys for death row inmates have to prove mental impairment " beyond a reasonable doubt			0
" " this is the strictest standard in any jurisdiction in the nation , " @entity24 said			0
@entity0 's execution comes two weeks after the state executed @entity96 , a @entity97 veteran suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder who killed @entity102 deputy @entity100 in 1998			1
@entity24 also was @entity96 's counsel			0
@entity24 , who has represented @entity0 for 20 years , said in any other state , @entity0 would have served a life sentence			1
@entity0 was sentenced to death in 1990 for killing fellow prison inmate @entity106 , beating him to death with a nail - studded board			1
at the time , @entity0 had been serving a life sentence for the 1985 shooting death of his girlfriend @entity111			1
" we acknowledge that mr. @entity0 should be held accountable for his actions and behavior , " @entity112 , president of the @entity113 , said in a letter written on @entity0 's behalf			0
" however , it is our contention that mr. @entity0 , who has an intellectual disability , should not be subject to capital punishment			0
" the @entity113 is a nonprofit organization that advocates for and serves people with intellectual and developmental disabilities			0
@entity0 had the support of the @entity127 , the @entity55 , and former president @entity128 and his wife , @entity129			0
the victim 's family and former jurors had also expressed support for mercy in @entity0 's case , saying they were n't given the option of life without parole when sentencing him to death			0
@entity24 had said seven doctors agreed that his client was intellectually disabled -- including three doctors for the state who initially evaluated @entity0 and said he did n't meet @entity3 's standard			2
@entity24 said those doctors have since signed an affidavit admitting they felt rushed during @entity0 's examination and now believe he does meet the standard for " intellectually disabled			0
" in previous clemency hearings , attorneys for the state have argued that @entity0 served in the @entity153 , held a job and managed his money before killing his girlfriend -- signs that he did n't necessarily meet the legal standard to be considered intellectually disabled , even though he has a low iq			1
but @entity24 said examples of @entity0 achieving " self - sufficiency " do n't make a strong case for his execution			2
@entity0 has an iq of approximately 70 , and " the emotional and cognitive ability of a young boy , " according to his attorney			0
several of the letters supporting @entity0 's clemency cited last year 's @entity20 decision that struck down a @entity171 law that used " unscientific standards for determining intellectual disability " for death row inmates			1
attorneys tried to use the @entity176 v. @entity171 decision as grounds to spare the life of @entity3 inmate @entity180 , who was sentenced to death for the murder of a local sheriff 's deputy			2
@entity180 , who also had an iq of 70 , was executed in december			0
@entity0 declined to request a special last meal , the @entity2 said			0
he was offered the institutional meal tray , consisting of shepherd 's pie , mashed potatoes , red beans , cabbage relish salad , cornbread , sugar cookies and fruit punch			0
@entity1 's @entity194 contributed to this report .			0
