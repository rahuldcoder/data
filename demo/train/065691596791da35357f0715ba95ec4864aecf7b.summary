president @entity0 and his certain @entity2 opponent in november , @entity1 , shifted to full general election mode wednesday , portraying each other as threats to future @entity7 progress as their campaigns engaged in a " war over women " indicative of what to expect for the next seven months			1
a day after his path to the @entity2 nomination cleared by chief rival @entity15 's withdrawal , @entity1 sought to reverse a gender gap problem by attacking @entity0 's economic policies as bad for women			1
according to a @entity21 / @entity20 poll released tuesday , @entity1 trails well behind @entity0 among women voters -- a result also seen in recent @entity25 and @entity27 / @entity26 polls			1
@entity0 had the support of 57 % of women , compared with 38 % who said they backed @entity1 , while @entity1 had the backing of 52 % of men , compared with 44 % who backed @entity0 , the survey found			1
in a speech in @entity37 at a woman - owned small business , @entity1 referred wednesday to a @entity41 attack line that @entity2 were waging a " war on women " through socially conservative policies involving abortion , health care and other issues by saying : " the real war on women is being waged by the president 's failed economic policies			1
" " now the president says , ' oh i did n't cause this recession			0
' that 's true , " @entity1 said			2
" he just made it worse , and made it last longer			0
and because it lasted longer , more and more women lost jobs , such that in his three - and - a - half years , 92.3 % of the people who lost jobs have been women			0
his failures have hurt women			0
" however , the nonpartisan website @entity66 rated the 92.3 % job loss statement " mostly false , " saying it included figures from the beginning of the @entity0 administration , before his policies could take effect			2
in addition , @entity66 said the figure failed to reflect a historical pattern of recessions first causing unemployment in traditionally male - dominated industries such as construction , and then later affecting fields with larger percentages of female workers			0
the @entity1 campaign later provided a copy of a letter it sent to @entity66 that challenged the " mostly false " rating			2
an analysis of federal labor statistics shows that the @entity1 claim is technically true but lacks important context			2
the number of nonfarm - employed women from january 2009 , when @entity0 took office , to march 2012 fell far more than the number of employed men in that period			2
the total job loss for the period for both men and women combined was 740,000			0
the number of women who lost nonfarm jobs in that time span was 683,000 , according to figures from the @entity108			0
that amounts to 92.3 % -- the figure @entity1 cited			2
however , the statistic does not reflect that men constituted a much larger chunk of the job loss pie in the year leading up to @entity0 's inauguration			2
in the 2008 calendar year , men lost a total of 2.7 million nonfarm jobs , compared with 895,000 jobs lost for women			0
men made up 75.4 % of the 3.6 million jobs lost that year			0
@entity1 's claim also does not reflect that the job losses for women began in march 2008 , almost a full year before @entity0 took office			1
at that point , women held a total of 67.3 million nonfarm payroll jobs , the highest level of female employment of the @entity135 administration			0
from that high point , the number of women with nonfarm payroll jobs fell for 23 consecutive months , spanning from the final 10 months of the @entity135 administration and first 13 months of the @entity0 administration			0
since february 2010 , women have actually gained 863,000 jobs			0
meanwhile , a @entity1 adviser initially hesitated when asked if @entity1 supported the @entity144 that expands workers ' rights to sue in the event of a pay discrepancy between a man and a woman			2
" we 'll get back to you on that , " romney campaign policy director @entity151 told reporters			0
a @entity1 campaign statement afterward said the candidate supported pay equity for women , but it did not specifically say he backed the 2009 @entity161 law			1
the @entity0 campaign immediately fired back , issuing a statement from @entity161 that criticized @entity1 for failing to " stand up for women and their families			1
" " anyone who wants to be president of the @entity7 should n't have to think about whether they support pursuing every possible avenue to ensuring women get the same pay for the same work as men , " @entity161 said in the statement			0
a @entity1 campaign official later said that the candidate had no plans to change the current pay equity laws if elected			1
@entity178 , the senior adviser to @entity0 's campaign , called it a " tough day " for @entity1 's efforts to repair damage with women voters stemming from the @entity2 primary campaign			1
@entity178 dubbed the those efforts the " @entity188 with @entity189 " in a @entity187 post			0
@entity0 , meanwhile , continued his push for @entity191 to pass a tax measure that would ensure that millionaires -- like @entity1 -- pay a higher tax rate than middle - class workers			1
" it 's just plain wrong that middle - class @entity201 pay a higher share of their income in taxes than some millionaires and billionaires , " @entity0 told a @entity197 event , flanked by millionaires who support the proposed measure			1
@entity2 want to cut taxes for the wealthy , which would mean cutting spending on programs that spur economic growth and benefit the middle class , senior citizens and the poor , @entity0 argued			2
" they want to double down on some of the inequities that already exist in the tax code , " he said , adding that such a step means " either you 've got to borrow more money to pay down a deeper deficit , or you 've got to demand deeper sacrifices from the middle class and you 've got to cut investments that help us grow as an economy			0
" citing " significant " deficits and the need to be competitive in the 21st century 's " technologically integrated economy , " @entity0 said : " we ca n't afford to keep spending more money on tax cuts for wealthy @entity201 who do n't need them and were n't even asking for them			2
" in a swipe at @entity2 economic policy , @entity0 added : " in @entity7 , prosperity has never just trickled down from the wealthy few			0
" also wednesday , the @entity0 campaign released a video highlighting @entity1 's conservative stances on issues such as abortion rights , health care reform and immigration reform			1
the video concludes with @entity1 's declaration on the campaign trail that he was " a severely conservative @entity2 governor			1
" the competing messages were attempts by both sides to frame what is expected to be a close and vicious general election campaign in a favorable perspective			1
@entity0 portrays @entity1 and @entity2 as protectors of the wealthy at the expense of the middle class , while @entity1 and his party say @entity0 has stifled economic recovery and failed to effectively tackle deficit reduction			2
@entity1 still needs to win several hundred delegates to clinch the @entity2 nomination , but @entity15 was his top remaining challenger , and tuesday 's announcement that @entity15 suspended his campaign leaves @entity1 's path free of obstacles			1
however , @entity1 's campaign still struggles to generate enthusiasm among the @entity2 conservative base , which questions his more moderate stances as @entity267 governor			1
sources said @entity1 wants @entity15 -- who had strong support among social conservatives , including @entity273 evangelicals -- to quickly endorse his campaign			1
while @entity1 and @entity15 aides said the former @entity7 senator from @entity277 will work to defeat @entity0 , it was unclear when or if @entity15 would offer a full - throated endorsement for @entity1			1
in his announcement tuesday that he was suspending his campaign , @entity15 never mentioned @entity1			1
" i expect when i finally become the nominee , and i hope that happens soon , that we 'll be campaigning together , we 'll be working together , " @entity1 said wednesday			0
" we share very much the same beliefs about the course the nation must take and the fact that under this president , @entity7 is not going in the right direction			0
" @entity15 has consistently said @entity2 needed a true conservative candidate -- himself -- to defeat @entity0 , and he has relentlessly attacked @entity1 's support for health care reforms in @entity267 that included a mandate for coverage similar to the 2010 federal health care law despised by conservatives			1
@entity1 said he would try to attract @entity15 's evangelical and socially conservative supporters by leveraging appearances with the former candidate			1
" we campaign together and make sure we see these people and get a chance to talk to them about issues that all @entity201 care about , " @entity1 said			2
" i think you see our party , and you will see our party more united than it 's been in a long , long time , in part because president @entity0 has taken @entity7 in such a different course than we have ever gone as a nation before			1
" former house speaker @entity311 and @entity313 rep. @entity312 , the other @entity2 challengers who trail far back , said they intended to stay in the race to the @entity2 convention in august			0
the @entity0 campaign immediately took aim at @entity1 after @entity15 's announcement , with campaign manager @entity320 saying it was " no surprise that @entity1 finally was able to grind down his opponents under an avalanche of negative ads. " " the more the @entity7 people see of @entity1 , the less they like him and the less they trust him , " @entity320 said in a statement			1
" while calling himself the ' ideal candidate ' for the tea party , he has promised to return to the same policies that created the economic crisis and has alienated women , middle - class families and @entity201			0
" @entity27 's latest estimate of the @entity2 delegate tally shows @entity1 with 659 , @entity15 with 275 , @entity338 with 140 and @entity312 with 71			1
it takes 1,144 delegates to clinch the nomination			0
@entity343 , @entity344 , @entity345 and @entity37 vote on april 24 , in addition to @entity277			0
in all , 231 delegates are up for grabs in the five states			0
the goal now for @entity338 and @entity312 is to prevent @entity1 from reaching the 1,144 - delegate threshold before the convention			0
on wednesday , though , @entity338 spent time explaining how a technical glitch caused his campaign to bounce a $ 500 check for @entity357 primary election fees .			0
