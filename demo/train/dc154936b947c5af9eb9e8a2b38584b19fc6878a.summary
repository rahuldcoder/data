@entity0 -- the lawsuit against @entity3 related to the fiery crash that killed actor @entity5 suffered a setback in court , but a lawyer says it will go on			1
@entity11 ' widow is suing that carmaker 's @entity13 branch , claiming negligence and a poor design of the high - powered @entity17 caused the crash last november			1
@entity19 district judge @entity18 dismissed four of the five grounds for the lawsuit , finding that the complaint did not include enough specifics			1
@entity11 can revive the arguments by amending her lawsuit , @entity18 said in an order filed in federal court monday			1
" he only granted a partial dismissal with leave to amend , which we will , " @entity11 lawyer @entity31 told @entity1 tuesday			1
@entity33 filed the suit against @entity35 in may , citing negligence as the cause of death of her husband and the 40 - year - old " @entity44 " star on november 30 in @entity42 , @entity43			0
she also alleged product liability and wrongful death			0
the only allegation that was not dismissed was the " strict liability claim " regarding the lack of a crash cage and racing fuel cell for the high - performance car			2
the @entity54 lawsuit contends that a " properly functioning crash cage " would have prevented the deaths by preventing " intrusion into the passenger compartment , " damage to the fuel tank , and the splitting of the vehicle in half			0
read the judge 's full decision here @entity11 , 38 at the time of his death , spent his competitive racing career driving @entity3 cars			1
according to the court documents , he and @entity5 first met on the race track when @entity11 was driving a @entity3 owned by the actor			1
a few years later the two men formed the racing team @entity74 , where they were both drivers			0
" although mr. @entity11 had a passion for cars , mr. @entity11 was first and foremost dedicated to his family , his wife , @entity33 , and their two young children , " the complaint states			1
the court documents filed by @entity33 describe the 2005 @entity17 that her husband was driving as a an " ultra-high - performance - super - sports car for the road , " that goes from zero to 60 mph in 3.5 seconds and has a top speed of 205 miles per hour			2
the complaint argues that such a high - powered sports car should have a higher standard of crash protection , and that a mechanical malfunction forced @entity11 to veer off the road			1
@entity31 also hired investigators to evaluate wreckage at the scene , who determined that @entity11 was driving 55 mph before the vehicle went out of control			2
this contradicts the @entity0 coroner 's report that car was speeding at more than 100 mph , and the investigations by the @entity101 and @entity102 that focused on speed			0
@entity3 pointed to the discrepancy			2
" as you know , the crash was subject of a very detailed investigation by the authorities , both the @entity102 and the @entity111 , " said @entity105 , head of public relations for @entity35			0
" the reports showed that driving at a high speed in a negligent manner caused the crash			0
both concluded that there was no mechanical defect of the vehicle involved			0
" " their investigation disproves in the allegations in the lawsuit , " he said			0
@entity1 's @entity123 and @entity124 contributed to this report .			0

a federal judge dismissed most of the lawsuit claims , but it can be *refiled*
the lawyer for the @entity11 family says the lawsuit will go on
the widow of @entity11 *accuses* @entity136 of negligence and poor car design
