@entity0 , @entity1 -- for @entity4 , life was simpler when it was tea time all the time			1
when he was gunning for the @entity10 nomination for the @entity11 in @entity1 , the former speaker of the @entity8 aggressively courted the state 's conservative @entity13 activists			1
@entity4 was suddenly a @entity13 favorite			1
his stunning rise in the polls forced @entity1 's more moderate governor , @entity19 , to bolt the @entity10 primary to run as an independent			1
but the race is now more complicated , with @entity4 competing in a three - way battle royal against both @entity19 and the @entity25 nominee , @entity1 rep. @entity26			1
@entity4 's grass - roots campaign has put together a team of high - powered @entity29 and @entity31 - based @entity10 consultants			1
over the summer , this son of @entity34 exiles distanced himself from @entity35 on one of the conservative movement 's key issues , @entity40 's tough anti-illegal immigration law			0
" the original law allowed for racial profiling			0
i do n't think they intended that			0
i do n't believe they did			0
but the original language in that law allowed for racial and ethnic profiling			0
and they changed that , to their credit , a week later			0
they passed a bill that changed that , " @entity4 said			2
still , @entity4 does n't want even the amended @entity40 legislation to become the law of the land			2
" i do n't think the @entity40 bill should serve as a model for the rest of the country , " he added			0
in an interview with @entity2 , @entity4 blamed both parties for the nation 's problems and said he plans to be his own man if elected to the @entity11			2
" i represent the things i stand for , " @entity4 said			2
@entity13 activists in @entity1 still support @entity4			1
but one of the movement 's leaders , @entity1 @entity13 chairman @entity73 , says he will be watching @entity4 's moves closely			1
" when you send a politician to @entity29 , you 're always worried whether you 're going to get the same guy back , " @entity73 said			2
one of the biggest worries among @entity35 is that @entity4 will be another @entity79			0
the @entity80 @entity10 had the backing of the @entity13 in his race to replace the late sen. @entity83			1
but as a senator , @entity79 has shown his own independent streak and has voted on occasion with the @entity25			0
not to fear , says @entity4 , who is set to speak at a @entity13 rally in @entity1 later this month			1
but the 39 - year - old @entity10 nominee has good reason to consider a move to the political middle in this swing state			2
@entity19 's new ads tout the governor as a fresh independent voice , forcing both @entity4 and @entity26 to defend their respective political bases			1
that 's created a fascinating sideshow in this three - ring political circus : an alliance of sorts between the @entity13 - backed @entity4 and @entity26			1
nearly every day , both the @entity4 and @entity26 campaigns send out e-mails blasting @entity19			1
one of @entity26 's e-mails showcases a recent newspaper editorial in @entity1 that slammed @entity19 as a " campaign chameleon			1
" " @entity19 is trying to be indefinable in this race			2
and that has an expiration date on it			0
and that date has come and passed , " @entity26 said in an interview with @entity2			0
@entity19 declined to be interviewed for this story			0
" i think people deserve to know what the next @entity116 senator from @entity1 is going to be about , " @entity4 said			0
" the last thing we need in @entity1 is a political opportunist			0

@entity4 's rise in the polls was *fueled* partly by @entity13 activists
@entity19 *decided* to run as an independent , complicating the race for @entity4
@entity4 's grass - roots campaign managed by high - powered @entity29 and @entity31 @entity10 consultants
both the @entity4 and @entity26 campaigns send out e-mails blasting @entity19
