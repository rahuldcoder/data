a nurse 's release tuesday from an @entity3 hospital leaves a single person in the @entity5 now battling @entity6 , though she and others -- including president @entity8 -- stressed the fight against the deadly virus is n't over			1
" while this is a day for celebration and gratitude , i ask that we not lose focus on the thousands of families who continue to labor under the burden of this disease in @entity22 , " said 29 - year - old @entity11			1
about two weeks ago , @entity23 became the second nurse from @entity25 to get the virus while caring for @entity26 , a @entity27 man who began showing @entity6 symptoms after arriving in @entity29 and died of it there			1
she and @entity32 -- the other @entity33 nurse who was discharged from a @entity35 facility in @entity36 on friday -- are differ from the handful of other @entity5 ebola cases in the @entity5 because they caught the disease in @entity5 , rather than contracting it in @entity22			1
@entity23 's diagnosis came amid a wave of national concern about the @entity6 could spread in the @entity5 , especially after it became known she 'd flown on two commercial flights after treating @entity26			1
yet there was no such alarm tuesday			0
instead , @entity50 's dr. @entity49 declared @entity23 " has recovered from her infection with ebola virus , and she can return to ... her community and to her life " without any concerns about infecting anyone			0
ebola outbreak : get up to speed standing behind a lectern in a gray suit , @entity23 thanked @entity62 as well as those at the @entity3 hospital , where she arrived october 15			0
she also voiced appreciation for dr. @entity68 and @entity69 , two @entity5 who got @entity6 in @entity22 and were treated at @entity50 , for their contributions of plasma for people in the @entity5 struggling with the disease			1
dr. @entity74 is now the only person in the @entity5 being treated for @entity6			1
the 33 - year - old was admitted to @entity76 in @entity77 after developing a fever on thursday , six days after returning to the @entity5 and over a week after leaving @entity79 , where he worked for @entity81			1
timeline of @entity74 's activities after returning home even without more cases , @entity6 remains a hot topic of conversation around the country			2
that includes a debate about whether anyone should be allowed into the @entity5 from @entity79 , @entity27 and @entity92 , or at least whether health care volunteers and others coming from those ebola - ravaged nations should be quarantined for three weeks upon arrival			2
president @entity8 said tuesday that " monitoring and movement guidance " for those returning from the region should be " sensible , " so long as it is based on science and does n't unnecessarily prove an obstacle to those who risk their lives and livelihoods to head overseas to help those in need			1
" we do n't want to discourage our health workers from going to the front lines and dealing with this in an effective way , " @entity8 said			0
" ... " we do n't just react based on our fears			1
we react based on facts			2
" @entity8 : we ca n't react ' based on our fears ' @entity5 focused on @entity22 @entity49 , from @entity50 , said that his hospital has learned " a great deal " from treating four @entity6 patients			1
that includes lessons on things such as fluid and electrolyte management and that physicians can successfully treat @entity6 patients who need dialysis			0
still , while sharing such information with other @entity5 health care professionals could be helpful , it wo n't end the threat			0
" the thing that we really have to keep in mind is that the only way that we are truly to be able to make our citizens safe is that we control the outbreak in @entity22 , " said @entity49			0
this is a point @entity8 has made repeatedly , including again on tuesday			0
he insists " no other nation is doing as much to make sure " we contain @entity6 at its source , from the medical experts on the ground to approximately 1,000 @entity5 troops ( with 3,000 more to come ) involved in helping local officials with everything from logistics to building treatment centers			2
some @entity5 service members are now in quarantine at an @entity151 base in @entity152 , @entity153 , after returning from @entity22 , according to maj. gen. @entity154 , the commander of @entity151 forces in @entity22 who is among those isolated			2
@entity154 talks to @entity157 from quarantine @entity159 even dispatched a top diplomat , ambassador to the @entity162 @entity161 , who arrived tuesday in the @entity27 capital of @entity164			0
she told reporters her visit aims " to show solidarity with the people of the region so that you know that you are not alone as you face this terrible epidemic , " as well as to help @entity27 emerge from the crisis " stronger and more resilient			1
" after speaking tuesday to members of a multiagency @entity176 , who have been in @entity22 since august , the president offered a hint of optimism			0
" the good news is that it 's starting to have an impact , " @entity8 said of such @entity5 efforts			1
" they are starting to see some progress in @entity27 , and the infrastructure is beginning to get built out			0
" still , progress does n't equate to victory			0
according to the @entity189 , there are more than 10,000 confirmed or suspected cases of @entity6 -- almost all in @entity79 , @entity27 and @entity92 -- and nearly 5,000 deaths			2
and those are only the ones that authorities have been able to count , in a region where health care access and record - keeping is limited			0
the @entity189 , the @entity162 ' health authority , has said that the mortality rate from the current outbreak , starting with the first death in december , is about 70 %			0

discharged nurse asks that we do n't " lose focus " on those suffering in @entity22
@entity5 can not " react based on our fears , " president @entity8 says
@entity5 diplomat arrives in @entity27 to show " solidarity "
there 's now only one person , a doctor in @entity77 , with @entity6 in the @entity5
