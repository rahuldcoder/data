-- @entity1 , the latest version of @entity4 's operating software for its @entity6 computers , was released to the public on wednesday			1
it 's an update that continues to blur the line between software on mobile devices and desktop computers			1
marking the eighth major release of new software for @entity4 computers , @entity1 offers 250 new features , according to the company			1
with multi-touch gesturing , full - screen app display and access to the @entity20 built directly into the software , the system was clearly designed to make working on a @entity6 more similar to working on an @entity24			0
" @entity1 is the best version of @entity28 yet , and we 're thrilled that users around the world can download it starting today , " said @entity25 , @entity4 's senior vice president of worldwide product marketing , said in a written statement			1
" @entity1 makes upgrading a @entity6 easier than ever before ; just launch the @entity20 , buy @entity1 with your @entity34 account , and the download and install process will begin automatically			2
" @entity38 of @entity39 called @entity1 @entity4 's " most radical new @entity6 operating system in years , " calling it a " giant step in the merger of the personal computer and @entity45 devices like tablets and smartphones			1
" the new system , however , does not run @entity50 or @entity24 apps ( at least , not yet ) and it does run @entity52 -- something @entity53 and company have summarily banished from their mobile devices			2
its touch features use a touchpad , making them similar , but not exactly the same , as what @entity50 and @entity24 users may be used to on their touchscreens			0
@entity38 said he likes the system , but warned that new users may suffer during their transition			0
" switching to @entity1 will require a major adjustment even for veteran @entity6 users , though it will be easier for those who use iphones or @entity24 , " he wrote			0
" @entity1 will significantly increase the learning curve for @entity71 users switching to the @entity6 " @entity72 of @entity73 wrote that " some of @entity1 's @entity75 - like features scale up very well , while others behave very poorly in a desktop environment			1
" he found the software 's @entity24 - like scrolling feature distracting and dizzying ( he eventually disabled it ) but said he enjoyed the system 's app - opening full - screen mode and praised new sharing and auto - save functions			0
@entity1 is available as a $ 29.99 upgrade for people with the latest version of the @entity89 operating system			1
it will be available at @entity91 in august for $ 69.99			0
@entity1 is the latest in a long line of cat - named operating systems rolled out by @entity4 for its computers			2
past versions have included @entity97 , @entity98 , @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity101 , @entity89 and @entity89			0
whether the king of the jungle marks the last version of feline - named software remains to be seen -- but we 're still holding out hope for @entity108 .			0
