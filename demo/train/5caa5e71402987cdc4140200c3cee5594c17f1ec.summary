-- there is a consistent message on @entity4 state media concerning the situation in @entity6			1
the revolving " crisis in @entity6 " bug on state news channel @entity10 24 sums it up			1
it shows the players on the ground on a loop : 1 ) unmasked , kindly looking @entity18 separatists against the background of the orange and black ribbon of @entity22 , the ubiquitous symbol of @entity18 sentiment and of @entity26 military glory , 2 ) masked , authoritarian - looking @entity6 state security against the national flag , and 3 ) a balaclava - clad ultra-nationalist against the red and black flag of @entity6 's @entity32 ( @entity33 ) party -- the ultimate bogeyman of the conflict , as far as @entity4 is concerned			1
it 's all part of the @entity39 narrative that @entity6 is at risk of a fascist takeover			1
" @entity44 is now being used to designate all things obnoxious and bad in the @entity39 line of argument so you call fascists those who allegedly seek to oppress the @entity4 speaking population in @entity6 , " says @entity43 based political analyst @entity42			1
" and in @entity4 domestically you have this tendency of anyone who disagrees with the main line to be called a fascist			2
" media fates and fortunes this talk , @entity42 says , is all part of a broader notion of patriotism , carefully honed across state media , which tapped into a swelling of national pride over the @entity65 and kept its momentum through @entity4 's annexation of @entity68			1
it is a redefining of boundaries many @entity4 feel was a historical injustice made right , the return of the peninsula to the motherland			2
in this climate , some , like the editor in chief of @entity77 , feel they face unusually strong hounding if deemed unpatriotic			0
@entity77 -- one of @entity4 's few independent media outlets -- was dropped by most cable operators a few weeks ago after a poll it ran in a talk show			1
" we asked the question , was it necessary to give @entity92 to the @entity93 for the sake of the survival of the city , " says editor in chief @entity88			0
" some viewers felt that the question was insulting and in about 10 minutes our editor of our website apologized and we deleted the question			0
but there was a huge campaign against us , blaming us for insulting all the veterans of the @entity92 siege			0
" even as @entity88 suspected that the @entity39 was behind the cable operators ' decision , president @entity104 mentioned @entity107 in last week 's question and answer session with the nation - promising to do what he could to help			0
shortly thereafter , the cable operators said they were prepared to negotiate with @entity107			0
a sign of the sway the @entity39 has on media fates and fortunes			0
@entity88 says he 's worried about a polarization of @entity4 society over the @entity6 crisis			1
" they really see us as traitors			0
and that 's really worse			0
because the new generation is coming , that really believes that there is some kind of 5th column , some group of @entity130 -- as @entity131 used to say ' mercenarios ' -- those people paid by the @entity130 countries who are working just to undermine the greatness of @entity4			2
" sweep of history @entity88 believes @entity104 's third term is characterized by a desire to place himself firmly within the grand sweep of history			0
" something like @entity141 or @entity142 -- he wants to change the history of this country and be the great statesman and liberator			0
" in the context of @entity6 , that appears to be working			2
according to opinion polls around the time of the @entity68 referendum , some 70 % of @entity4 approved of @entity104 's leadership			1
the notion that president @entity104 is taking care of the interests of all those associated with the motherland in @entity4 's near abroad is falling on fertile soil			1
it 's on domestic issues -- such as housing and social welfare -- that @entity42 says people are n't quite so prepared to accept the @entity39 's story , which he believes is telling			1
" domestically i think people are keenly aware of the issues they are facing with their daily lives and i do n't think it 's easy to mislead them			2
but internationally i think this nationalist feeling , this feeling of being strong is also quite natural			0
" how will the crisis end ? 5 possible scenarios @entity174 troops in @entity175 as @entity6 crisis persists			2

@entity4 state media 's message is that @entity6 risks a fascist takeover , @entity178 says
analyst @entity42 says " fascist " is now applied to those who oppose @entity43 's view
@entity42 says a broader notion of patriotism *portrays* @entity68 's annexation as a *wrong* righted
but he says @entity4 support for *foreign* policy does n't blind them to domestic issues
