-- too few @entity1 are willing to talk about sexually transmitted infections , or @entity3 , but we simply can not afford to avoid these discussions any longer			0
the @entity6 recently released data showing just how common and costly @entity8 are in the @entity1 , especially for @entity1 's youth			2
each year , we have 20 million new @entity8 cases , half among teens and young adults ages 15 to 24			1
across the nation at any given time , there are more than 110 million total infections , including new and existing infections			0
while the number of new infections is roughly equal among young women and young men , the health consequences of untreated @entity8 can be much more serious for young women , including losing the ability to have children			1
every year , about 24,000 women in the @entity1 become infertile because of an sti they probably did n't even know they had , because most infections have no symptoms			1
left untreated , common @entity3 such as chlamydia and gonorrhea can also cause chronic pelvic pain , ectopic pregnancy and increase @entity33 risk			0
human papillomavirus , or @entity35 , is by far the most common @entity8 , representing nearly three - quarters of all @entity8 cases			1
while the vast majority of @entity35 infections will not cause serious harm , some infections will persist and can lead to cervical cancer			0
beyond the impact on an individual 's health , @entity8 are also a significant drain on the @entity1 health care system			2
recent data place the cost of treating @entity8 at nearly $ 16 billion annually			2
infections among young people account for nearly half of that cost ( approximately $ 7.8 billion )			1
young people are most at risk for several reasons			1
they are more likely to have multiple sex partners			0
young women are biologically more susceptible to @entity8 , and many young people may be reluctant to disclose their risk behavior to a doctor , because of embarrassment , stigma or concerns about confidentiality			1
the good news is that all @entity8 are preventable and most are curable			1
but , because most stis have no symptoms , testing is the necessary first step to treatment			1
@entity6 recommends annual chlamydia screening for sexually active women 25 years old and under			0
annual gonorrhea screening is also recommended for sexually active women with new or multiple sex partners and women who live in communities with a high burden of the disease			0
sexually active gay and bisexual men should be tested at least annually for @entity33 , syphilis , chlamydia and gonorrhea			0
all @entity1 should be screened at least once for @entity33			0
in addition , for those who have not previously received the hpv vaccination , @entity6 recommends vaccination for all teen girls and young women through age 26 , as well as teen boys and young men through age 21			1
to increase the early diagnosis and treatment of @entity8 , @entity6 is reaching out to health care providers and young people at risk throughout the nation with messages about the importance of screening			1
but many more voices will be required to stop the silent , continuing toll of @entity8			2
in our communities , we must speak out against the shame and stigma that has too long been associated with @entity8			2
parents and caregivers need to open the door for frank , honest discussions with their children about @entity8 and behaviors that can place them at risk			0
and physicians need to talk to their young patients about @entity8 , risk behaviors and effective prevention methods			2
sexually active @entity1 should talk with their doctor about @entity3 and which tests may be right for them			0
a little knowledge about @entity8 and regular screening can go a long way			0
it 's also important for those who are sexually active to talk openly and honestly with partners about @entity8 , and to use condoms consistently and correctly			0
the severe health and economic toll of @entity8 in @entity1 is entirely preventable			1
with increased awareness , prevention , testing and treatment we can bring this hidden epidemic into the spotlight and safeguard the health of young people while saving the nation billions of dollars in the process			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity144 .			0

@entity144 : each year , we have 20 million new @entity8 cases , half of them among young people
@entity144 : the health consequences of untreated @entity8 can be more serious for young women
she says most stis have no symptoms , so testing is the necessary first step to treatment
@entity144 : stis are preventable and most are curable , but we need to raise get the word out
