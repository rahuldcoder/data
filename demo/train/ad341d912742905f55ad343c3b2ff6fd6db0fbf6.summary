@entity0 -- he 's already served the time , but lawyers thursday argued to clear his name as onetime @entity7 sgt. @entity6 appeals a conviction for the torture of detainees once held at the @entity11 in @entity12			1
@entity11 prison was taken over by the @entity12 government after claims of abuse by @entity18 troops			0
disturbing snapshots and video portraying sexual humiliation and physical intimidation against the detainees tarnished the image of the @entity18 as it fought to stabilize @entity12 after the @entity18 overthrow of @entity25			0
a military panel found @entity6 guilty in march 2006 on allegations that he used his military working dog to illegally " terrorize and frighten " detainees as part of interrogation techniques at the @entity18 - managed facility in @entity33			1
but his lawyer , @entity7 lt. col. @entity34 , told a military appeals court thursday that the conviction was based on faulty instructions to the jury			1
" nowhere in this case did the government establish that the use of the dog was illegal , " the defense counsel said , noting that @entity6 " was not trained in interrogation techniques			1
" the military 's prosecutor , @entity7 maj. @entity44 , argued that @entity6 " would know it 's unlawful " to use his unmuzzled dog to snarl within inches of a detained prisoner 's face			1
@entity6 was originally sentenced to 179 days confinement and received a bad conduct discharge			2
@entity6 was not in the courtroom for the proceedings			2
@entity34 told @entity1 that he was not authorized to disclose his whereabouts but confirmed that his client remains on " appeal release " status after completing a three - month sentence			0
if the appeal fails , the discharge stands			0
if the appeals court overturns the conviction , @entity6 could return to the military and may receive back pay , pension and other benefits			1
the judges did not indicate when they may rule after each side presented oral arguments thursday			0
at the 2006 court - martial , the jury found @entity6 guilty of charges that he used his military dog , @entity76 , to terrify prisoners , allegedly for amusement and in competition with other soldiers			1
@entity6 also was found guilty of an indecent act involving his dog			1
a female soldier testified on the first day of the court - martial that she had allowed @entity6 's dog to lick peanut butter she had placed on her bare chest as part of a dare from another soldier , who videotaped the stunt			2
" it was foolish , stupid and juvenile , " @entity6 said of the incident , reading from a statement			0
" there 's nothing i can do to take it back			0
if i could , i would			0
" @entity6 did not specifically express regret for the wrongdoing involving detainees .			2

former sgt. @entity6 served three months on torture conviction
lawyer says @entity6 did *n't* know it was illegal to use working dog to *threaten* detainees
@entity6 could return to military if conviction is overturned
