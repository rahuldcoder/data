-- " i can not tell you how excited i am that later today we will be playing football on my grandmother 's lawn			0
one warning , though : if anyone breaks a window , you can answer to her			0
" the @entity11 was speaking just before the first official football match at @entity13			1
prince @entity14 , the heir to the @entity16 throne , is president of the @entity17 ( @entity17 ) , a role he says is an extension of a personal passion : " the beautiful game has changed an awful lot during the queen 's reign , but it remains the most loved game in the country , most probably the world , " he said			1
he describes football as " a chance to escape with friends and family and enjoy its virtues -- teamwork , competition , endeavor and , more occasionally on my part , skill			1
" on monday he had a chance to show off those skills on the specially prepared pitch at the @entity13			1
wearing boots given to him by @entity42 and @entity17 star @entity43 , he joined members of the queen 's household team in a training session			1
prince @entity14 is a fan of @entity49 side @entity48 but he chose two teams from lower leagues to play a full 90 - minute match on the royal grounds to mark the 150th anniversary of the @entity17			1
@entity55 is the only surviving member of the @entity17 formed in 1863 , and @entity57 was formed slightly later in 1875			2
but the day was really about rewarding the unsung heroes of the national game : " @entity61 football thrives on the support of its volunteers week after week , " he said			0
many of those volunteers were invited to the palace to see the match			0
there was nothing but praise for the royal groundsmen who spent weeks getting the garden match - fit			0
watch : @entity74 interviews @entity14 this is a space normally graced only by family members and the odd garden party			2
it has its own unique challenges for a city center garden			0
the park - like space is a flourishing habitat for wildlife including a large gaggle of geese whose droppings litter the entire space at this time of year			0
the groundsmen spent much of the morning cleaning up the football pitch with a vacuum cleaner			2
they then swept away the carpet of leaves away with wooden brooms			0
but the fact the @entity97 was away did provide one advantage : " there should n't be any corgis running on to the pitch , " prince @entity14 joked			1
now the historic match is over ( @entity57 won 2 - 1 ) the corgis and geese have their garden back .			2
