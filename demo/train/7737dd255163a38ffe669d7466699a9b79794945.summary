that is sometimes curable by early surgery			0
while i was not his physician and do n't have access to the details of his illness or its treatment , assertions that his use of alternative medicine shortened his life strike me as uninformed			1
no one knows how long he would have survived or what his quality of life would have been had he opted for immediate surgery and used only conventional treatment			1
for the past 40 years i have studied alternative and complementary therapies to learn which of them might usefully be combined with conventional approaches to develop a safer , more effective and more cost - effective system of care -- the result is the integrative medicine that i practice and teach			1
in the course of these investigations , i have looked at many alternative cancer treatments and found none of them to be effective			1
yet i find our standard cancer treatments to be incomplete and sometimes more harmful than beneficial			2
in the case of pancreatic cancer , they usually offer minimal extended survival , often at the expense of reduced quality of life			1
in october , 2010 , i traveled in @entity46 to learn more about efforts there to integrate @entity50 and @entity46 medicine			2
my hosts took me to @entity53 in @entity54 , a very large modern medical center devoted entirely to integrative medicine			1
its largest department is oncology			0
every cancer patient there gets appropriate surgery , chemotherapy and radiation therapy , as well as sophisticated herbal therapy designed to reduce toxicity and increase efficacy of those treatments , to strengthen body defenses against cancer and enhance quality of life			1
acupuncture and nutrition are also part of the hospital 's integrative cancer treatment			1
seeing the large number of successful outcomes there made me sad that few @entity81 cancer patients can access this kind of care			2
what most impressed me is that it is supervised by fully trained oncologists in an academic medical center			0
cancer centers in the @entity81 that claim they offer " integrative " care stick to the safest complementary services -- massage , stress reduction , counseling			1
they would n't let a @entity46 herb on their premises -- even a totally safe one like astragalus ( from the root of @entity100 ) that helps protect bone marrow from the toxic effects of some chemotherapy agents			0
@entity81 oncologists commonly tell patients to avoid all dietary supplements and natural remedies while undergoing treatment and to eat whatever they want			0
that 's not good enough			0
if cancer is confined to one part of the body and is accessible , surgery is usually curative , and it would be foolish not to use it			1
unfortunately , by the time many cancers are first detected , they have already spread from their point of origin			0
chemotherapy and radiotherapy may be the best treatments we have in those cases , but they are crude approaches that damage normal cells as well as malignant ones , especially in sensitive tissues of the immune system			0
i 'm sure they will eventually be replaced by targeted , individualized therapies that cause less collateral damage			0
in the meantime , much can be done to improve our management of cancer			0
i would urge patients and families not to reject surgery , chemotherapy , or radiotherapy but to seek and demand integrative treatment			2
the @entity146 for @entity147 that i direct has graduated a number of oncologists from its intensive fellowship training ; a goal of the center is to develop formal training in integrative oncology			0
the @entity155 will hold its 8th annual international conference in @entity157 next month ; it is co-sponsored by @entity158			0
again , i do n't know enough about @entity1 ' cancer or the treatments he used to comment on them specifically			1
i hope he was lucky enough to find an integrative oncologist to help him with the tough decisions that all cancer patients must make about the recommendations they get , both from conventional doctors and others			2
i wish that all cancer patients could partner with integrative oncologists to guide them through the maze of confusing options , avoid fraudulent treatments and scams and make use of all safe and effective therapies to eliminate tumors , prevent recurrences and preserve quality of life			1
by demanding integrative oncology practitioners and facilities , consumers can speed their appearance			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity187 .			2

@entity187 says he ca n't say if @entity1 's treatment choices shortened his life
he says in his studies he has found no alternative therapy for cancer that is effective
but , he says , alternative therapies can help strengthen body during cancer care
@entity187 : integrative medicine should be essential part of cancer care
