-- starting july 1 , @entity1 will offer free @entity2 nationwide , with no registration or account required			1
even better , @entity2 will not be time limited			0
@entity1 joins an increasing list of brands and chains to offer free @entity2 in its stores			1
for example , last december , @entity9 's rolled out free @entity2 to nearly all of its restaurants across the country			2
@entity14 also offers a similar program			0
@entity9 's and @entity1 both have partnerships with @entity17 , which , while often criticized for the quality of its wireless data network , is one of the largest @entity2 hotspot providers in the @entity23			1
@entity1 was one of the first chains to offer @entity2 access to its patrons , first via an agreement with @entity29 and then with @entity17			2
@entity1 visitors have been able to enjoy up to two hours of free @entity2 from their favorite coffee house , provided they are either an @entity17 customer or they use a @entity33 to login			1
the new program will do away with any sort of registration , which will make those of us who always forget either our @entity17 account information or ca n't find our @entity1 cards extremely happy			0
in addition to the new free @entity2 program , @entity1 ceo @entity41 told @entity45 's @entity44 that the company is also planning on rolling out a new @entity47 in partnership with @entity49 later this fall			1
this network , which will only be accessible in @entity23 company - operated stores , will offer customers free and unrestricted access to paid sites and services like @entity56 and other content providers on their phones , tablets or laptops			2
bringing the @entity61 we spoke with @entity63 , cio , @entity65 and @entity66 at @entity1 about the new plan for free @entity2 and the @entity47			1
according to @entity63 , the goal is to bring the overall @entity1 in - store experience online			2
the first step is in providing an overall better online experience			0
this is where one - click logon comes into play , as well as the ability to connect with your device , be it a laptop or phone or @entity82			0
the second part is the branded @entity1 online experience			0
rather than just trying to create an aggregated portal of sources , @entity1 will be bringing quality content that is usually behind a pay wall to customers to access for free while in @entity1 stores			1
different categories , like business news , lifestyle , music , entertainment , etc. will provide access to different content			0
this means that you can visit the @entity56 uninhibited , as well as @entity101 and also get local content from services like @entity104 pulled into your default @entity1 page			2
furthermore , stuff like the @entity111 " @entity109 promotion can now be integrated online , meaning that you can download the free weekly track from your @entity114 or @entity82 or laptop , instead of having to use the cards with the redeem codes			0
the physical cards will still be available but for connected visitors , this is an easier way to access free content			0
the opportunity for premium service providers is that by offering free content to users while they are at @entity1 , they are potentially gaining new customers			1
a user might find they really enjoy some of the pay @entity56 content and look at subscribing at home , for example			0
more and more providers will be announced as the launch date gets closer and @entity1 is committed to finding the best pay wall content it can bring to its audience			1
what do you think of @entity1 new free @entity2 plan and the content deals ? let us know in the comments			1
