@entity0 , @entity1 -- the headline from one @entity1 newspaper summed up the days to come for president @entity5 : " @entity5 in the @entity6			2
" during a fast - paced three - day overseas trip that includes visits to @entity0 , @entity1 and a g - 20 summit in @entity10 , @entity11 , the president will face allied , yet skeptical leaders who remain unconvinced that military action is necessary to punish @entity15 for its alleged use of chemical weapons			1
even as @entity5 administration officials acknowledge that @entity15 will be an ongoing subject of discussion , they dismiss the notion the president is fighting a losing diplomatic battle , noting support from both @entity26 and @entity27			0
@entity5 's visit to @entity1 marks the first time a sitting @entity31 president has visited the nation 's archipelago capital city of @entity0			1
however , the president is only visiting the @entity36 nation as a result of his administration 's decision to cancel a bilateral summit in @entity41 with @entity11 president @entity42 , the latest example of worsening @entity31 - @entity11 relations			1
@entity5 - @entity42 will have a chance to talk on ' margins ' of @entity48 summit @entity50 officials , including secretary of state @entity51 , have complained of @entity11 obstruction to any @entity54 intervention in @entity15 's bloody civil war			1
still , even on @entity5 's first stop , there is opposition to any unilateral @entity31 action against @entity15			1
" @entity1 does n't want a military attack ... i do n't believe that is the solution to the conflict , " @entity1 prime minister @entity61 told @entity1 public broadcaster @entity62 in an interview over the weekend			0
but @entity5 's principal adversary on @entity15 , @entity42 , appeared to open the door to @entity54 - sanctioned military action in an interview with the @entity72 and @entity11 's state channel 1			1
@entity74 out in the cold as @entity77 - @entity11 relations flourish " if there are data that the chemical weapons have been used , and used specifically by the regular army , this evidence should be submitted to the @entity83 , " @entity42 said			1
in response to @entity42 's remarks , a senior administration official said the @entity50 continues to be deeply skeptical about any support from @entity11 , which holds a key seat on the @entity83			0
but as the president arrived in @entity91 , there were signs of a potential thaw in the chill between @entity74 and @entity41			0
interactive : @entity31 and allied assets around @entity15 administration officials said tuesday @entity5 is expected to meet briefly with @entity42 at this week 's @entity48 -- " on the margins , " one @entity50 official said			1
that is a small but measurable improvement over what the @entity50 said late last month , when it indicated the two leaders would not spend any time together in @entity10			0
the relationship between @entity5 and @entity42 has suffered from one damaging episode after another in recent months			0
@entity11 's decision to grant temporary asylum to national security contractor turned leaker @entity110 was greeted with frustration by @entity5 administration officials			1
and then @entity5 's comparison of the @entity11 president 's body language to the " bored kid in the back of the classroom " did not go over well in @entity41			2
in his interview with the @entity72 and @entity120 , @entity42 urged observers not to read too much into the body language coming from other leaders			0
" we work , we argue about some issues			0
we are human , " @entity42 said			0
before the president 's trip to @entity11 , he will spend 24 hours in @entity1 , a nation administration officials describe as a key ally on issues ranging from national security to climate change			2
while in @entity0 , @entity5 is also scheduled to meet with @entity1 's @entity132 and pay tribute to the late @entity1 diplomat @entity134 , who is credited with saving the lives of tens of thousands of @entity136 during the @entity137			2
the big debate : should @entity31 strike @entity15 ?			0

@entity5 's three day overseas trip has him in @entity1 and @entity11
@entity11 appears to come on board for @entity15 strike if evidence is there
