-- what 's happening to " @entity2 ? " earlier this season , the acclaimed @entity4 series was the highest - rated comedy on tv			1
but @entity9 ' thursday king " @entity10 " has since climbed to top the weekly chart hitting recent season highs , and @entity2 has slipped to no. 2 and relinquished its crown			1
last night 's episode marks a season low for the show , down 10 percent to 10.1 million viewers and a 3.8 adults 18 - 49 rating			1
what 's behind the slippage ? well , its @entity4 neighbors sure do n't help much ( or rather , its " neighbors " )			2
and " @entity2 " now has to contend with @entity24 's " @entity23 , " which has likely had an impact the past few weeks ( one analyst noted that @entity2 tends to hit its low point around this time of year )			1
of course , " @entity10 " airs at 8 p.m. so it does n't even have a lead - in , also faces " @entity23 , " plus is an older show			2
@entity30 ? scientist estimates weight perhaps it 's that " @entity2 " is rather ambitious and creatively complex with a large cast that seeks to work as a comedy with tinges of deeply heartfelt drama â € ” pulling all that off week after week is huge juggling act			2
the rest of @entity4 's lineup had mixed results			1
" @entity42 " was down 8 percent			0
" @entity46 " was up 13 percent and " @entity45 " went up 17 percent ( thanks to @entity2 not running a repeat this week )			0
@entity47 sizes up ' @entity49 ' role on @entity9 , " @entity53 " tied its series low ; " csi " dropped 8 percent despite airing its well - promoted " csi : @entity55 " cross-over episode			1
@entity24 's " idol " led the night yet fell 16 percent for the start of @entity57			0
@entity59 was largely down about 10 percent except " @entity60 " which fluxed up a tenth			0
on the @entity62 , " @entity64 " rose a notch and " supernatural " was flat			0
