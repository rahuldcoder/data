-- when it comes to leadership and personal responsibility , president @entity1 has made his stance very clear : " the buck stops with me			1
" it 's a phrase he 's echoed countless times in the past			2
but now , he 's dealing with an accountability double - whammy -- fallout from the botched @entity13 website and global fury over the wiretapping of some allied leaders ' conversations			2
so what all did the president know , and when did he find out ? depends on who you ask			0
some @entity23 officials have said that @entity1 did n't know about problems with the health care enrollment site before it launched and that he only recently learned about a @entity28 operation that wiretapped @entity31 chancellor @entity30 's phone for a decade			1
" it is my understanding that president @entity1 was not aware chancellor @entity30 's communications were being collected since 2002 , " @entity33 chairwoman @entity32 said			1
" that is a big problem			0
" but other officials said @entity1 -- or at least his @entity42 staff -- did know about it			1
questions about what the president knew and when he knew it have important implications , analysts say			0
if @entity1 was aware , that could mean he is n't being clear with the @entity23 public now			1
and if he was n't aware , that could mean his own staff kept him in the dark			2
" there 's really no good answer , " said @entity56 strategist @entity55			1
" if he knew , essentially we 're being misled by different people in the administration about the extent of the president 's knowledge			2
if he did n't know , it 's an abdication of even the most basic responsibilities of the command and control over very important parts of his administration , and that becomes a problem			2
" @entity42 : do n't tie issues together in an exclusive interview with @entity0 last week , @entity76 secretary @entity75 said the president did n't know of problems with the @entity13 's website until after its fumbled launch on oct. 1 -- even though insurance companies had been complaining and the site crashed during a pre-launch test run			1
@entity42 spokesman @entity86 declined to detail what @entity1 knew and when			2
on monday , he said tying topics like problems with the @entity13 website and reports about @entity28 spying is " conflating a bunch of very disparate issues			2
" @entity86 said he would n't " get into individual reports about specific programs , " and would provide more details once a @entity42 review of @entity23 surveillance is complete			1
@entity32 said the @entity42 has told her that data collection on @entity23 allies will stop			1
but a senior administration official said @entity32 's statement was not completely accurate			0
the official said some changes have been made , but they are not across - the - board changes in policy like terminating intelligence collection aimed at allies			0
@entity31 's not the only country seething over the reports of @entity23 spying			1
@entity111 has summoned @entity23 @entity112 to discuss an @entity114 newspaper report that quoted unnamed sources as saying the @entity28 spied on @entity111 officials and politicians			1
much of the focus is on expanded surveillance under the @entity120 passed in the aftermath of the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks			0
many of the secrets spilling out about the @entity28 's surveillance program came from leaks by former agency contractor @entity127 , who was granted temporary political asylum in @entity129			0
experts : not every detail disclosed it 's plausible that @entity1 would n't know about specific surveillance targets , said @entity0 national security analyst @entity134 , a member of the @entity136 external advisory board			1
she said overall intelligence collection priorities are well - known by the @entity42			0
" specific targets , however , ( like ) @entity30 's cell phone , are not the sort of thing discussed with the @entity142			0
" no one should expect the president to know everything the @entity28 is doing , said @entity146 , a professor of history and public affairs at @entity149			0
" but when you 're talking about the surveillance of world leaders , and an issue that 's been controversial for a while now , you would expect that there 's some knowledge either by the president or people surrounding him			2
... i do think there 's surprise that this was off the radar in the inner circles of the @entity42			0
" time for change ? @entity164 rep. @entity164 , a key member of the @entity165 , said if the surveillance happened without the president 's knowledge , it has larger implications			0
" i would say if the president did not know , that raises very serious questions about what he 's doing as chief executive			0
the fact he would be going into negotiations and discussions and meetings with @entity30 or @entity182 leaders -- or any leaders for that matter -- and not be aware that there was surveillance going on of the private phone calls , to me either something is definitely wrong in his administration or he just has a totally hands - off attitude			0
to me , this is unacceptable			0
" @entity193 , a @entity0 political commentator and a columnist for the @entity195 , wondered whether some officials would lose their jobs if the president really was n't informed			1
" the question becomes , why do the people who failed to keep him in the loop still have their jobs ? " he asked			1
no matter what @entity1 knew , or when , some say it 's time for a new approach			1
" he has often said that he did n't know what was going on with the ( @entity209 ) website			1
... he ca n't pretend he does n't know and walk away from problems anymore , because he has been caught too many times out of the loop , " said @entity210 , associate editor of @entity211			2
" he ca n't do his job that way			0
" @entity0 's @entity217 , @entity218 , @entity219 , @entity220 , @entity221 and @entity222 contributed to this report .			0

@entity33 chair : @entity1 should have been told of some spying
officials say @entity1 did n't know details of the @entity209 website *glitches* and @entity23 spy programs
@entity56 strategist : " there 's really no good answer "
analyst : " why do the people who failed to keep him in the loop still have their jobs ? "
