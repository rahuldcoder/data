@entity0 , @entity1 -- just over one week ago , @entity1 authorities paraded 11 children accused of terrorism in front of the local media			1
the boys , aged 10 to 16 , were apprehended while attempting to plant home - made explosives on behalf of local militant groups operating in and around the city of @entity13 , in @entity14			1
the boys ' arrest highlights @entity1 's worsening civil strife and underscores how @entity1 terrorist groups continue to exploit children			1
this is not a recent phenomenon			2
in fact , terrorist groups in @entity23 and @entity1 are increasingly turning to children as operatives			1
a few weeks ago , my colleague @entity27 and i traveled to @entity1 's @entity0 to see firsthand how the @entity1 government is working to solve this problem			1
@entity0 includes the city of @entity32 , part of @entity35 province which borders @entity23			2
this is the region where 14 - year old @entity37 -- an activist for girls ' education -- narrowly survived a @entity41 assassination attempt last year			1
renowned for its picturesque vistas , the @entity0 region fell victim to a brutal reign of terror by the @entity1 @entity41 , or @entity41 in 2008			1
faced with an emboldened @entity41 , @entity1 's national army launched an 18 - month counterinsurgency campaign			1
law and order were restored and the @entity41 forced to retreat			1
an emerging success story -- and the reason for our visit to @entity0 -- is the establishment of " @entity56			2
" from the @entity58 meaning " the first ray of light from the dawn " , @entity56 is @entity1 's rehabilitation facility for child militants who were formerly recruited by the @entity41			1
some of these children were even prepared to become suicide bombers			1
@entity56 's team of psychologists , social workers and military advisers share a principal objective -- to prevent recidivism and ensure that its ' graduates ' do n't return to the fight			2
@entity56 joins a growing list of similar initiatives that have cropped up around the globe since the mid- 2000s			2
perhaps the best - known terrorist rehabilitation program is in @entity78			1
read how a cagefighter in @entity81 de-radicalizes convicted terrorists collectively characterized as " de-radicalization " programs , it is more accurate to call them " risk reduction " initiatives			1
they represent a change in the way counterterrorism campaigns are waged , and share the goal of reducing the risk of re-engagement in terrorism once the program 's graduates are allowed to return to their communities			1
so far , @entity56 has had 188 ' students ' fully participate in its program of risk assessment and rehabilitation			1
all of the boys were captured by the army or police in raids on @entity41 training camps			1
the boys spend anywhere from six months to two years at @entity112			2
a few have spent as long as three years in rehabilitation			0
in @entity1 , the @entity41 showed no hesitation in their use of children for terrorism			1
in fact , " recruitment " is hardly the right word			0
it became clear from our conversations at @entity112 that these children had little if any say in their induction			1
the younger children lacked the capability to refuse the terrorists , fearing their own safety or reprisals to their families			1
one mother explained to me that she had turned to the @entity41 when she could no longer cope with her son 's alcohol and drug abuse -- marijuana grows wild throughout @entity0			1
targeting children at risk like this provided the @entity41 with a perfect opportunity to reach out to parents with an offer to help " save " their children			1
the militants promised a future involving discipline , belonging , purpose , and meaningful work			0
in some cases , families faced a horrible choice -- pay an enormous financial tax ( double the annual wage ) or surrender a child to the movement			1
deception and manipulation have come to define the @entity41 's child induction practices such that the prevention of children 's involvement in violent extremism in @entity1 can hardly be characterized as counterinsurgency			1
it is instead a challenge of basic child protection			1
most of the children recalled overwhelmingly negative experiences at the training camps			2
after performing menial tasks , they were locked in a 4x5 meter room for the rest of the day			0
some reported being repeatedly beaten , and in a few cases , sexually assaulted by senior figures			0
one child with whom we spent some time graduated from such deplorable conditions only to be ' allowed ' to become a martyr , changing his mind literally at the last second			2
that boy is now one of @entity56 's brightest hopes for successful rehabilitation and reintegration , and a potential role model for younger children at @entity112			2
but he remains profoundly traumatized by his experiences			0
other children actually reported having had positive experiences with the @entity41			1
some became involved through family members already in the movement			0
for them , adventure , camaraderie , and a sense of purpose proved all too real			0
@entity203 was the family business , and even if the children did n't want to get involved , how could they refuse ? nobody knows exactly how old some of the children are			2
many do n't have birth certificates and do n't know their own age themselves			0
@entity212 ( not his real name ) is now about 17 - 18 years old			2
he is very soft - spoken and painfully shy , but spoke @entity214 very well			2
he has big brown eyes and a wonderful , broad smile			0
he was very thin , but so shy he would n't take the food offered to him at lunch			0
we were very sensitive to the trauma he had experienced at the hands of the terrorists			0
the staff briefed us about the abuse he endured			0
in our limited time with @entity212 , we were careful not to ask him anything that might upset him so we focused only on speaking about his future , and how he has adapted to life after @entity56			0
@entity212 is a great success story			0
one of the first graduates of the program , he excelled academically at @entity112			0
shortly after his repatriation to his home village , he won a scholarship to university			0
he chose to defer his admission to take care of his mother and younger brother			0
he occasionally comes back to @entity56 to visit the staff and also to talk to the younger students about how the program has changed his life			0
he is one of @entity56 's role models			0
although addressing the children 's needs and reducing the risk of re-engagement in terrorism are @entity56 's most pressing objectives , its staff are not unaware of the seemingly insurmountable obstacles that face the children when the leave the program			1
for @entity56 , so far it appears that recidivism is not the problem , though with any such program , we may have to wait a bit longer to see if someone returns to the fight			0
no terrorism risk - reduction program has a 100 % success rate , or even close to that			1
when such claims are made , it does n't take long to realize that there are significant questions surrounding definitions and measurement of " success " or " re-engagement			0
" such questions need to be answered if programs like these are to be supported as creative approaches to counterterrorism			0
knowing why they work is as important as knowing if they work			0
a few high profile instances of recidivism may spell the death - knell for such initiatives			2
as academic researchers who study violent extremism , we have a great deal of hope for such programs , and @entity112 in particular has been the shining ray its name implies			0
battling immense odds , @entity56 's staff remain infectiously optimistic and dedicated , and that 's one of the reasons we will return later this year			0
but time is not on their side			0
a few years ago , research conducted by dr. @entity27 highlighted the changing nature of women 's involvement in terrorism			0
today a similar argument could be made for the involvement of young children			2
both in @entity1 and @entity23 , the child suicide bomber has come to represent a routine terrorist profile			1
children are easier to manipulate , and like female operatives , they can penetrate security checkpoints without raising the normal levels of suspicions			2
a 2012 report from @entity23 suggested that almost 100 would - be child suicide bombers had been ' intercepted ' in the preceding 12 - month period			1
many of those boys were recruited in @entity13			0
what the rising tide of child militants means for the development of counter-terrorism initiatives , or even child protection , is unclear			1
@entity56 alone will certainly not solve this problem , but it , and programs like it must continue to develop if we are to truly prevent the next generation of militants .			0

center in @entity1 tries to rehabilitate children ready to be suicide bombers
the center works more as a child protection unit than a counterterror unit
families say @entity41 targets poor parents and at - risk children with promises of help
at least one child now at the center was sent on a suicide mission by the @entity41
