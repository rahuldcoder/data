@entity0 -- the @entity2 on thursday rejected a @entity4 bid to open debate on repealing the " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy banning openly gay and lesbian soldiers from military service , possibly killing any chance for it to get passed in the current congressional session			1
however , a bipartisan group of senators immediately said they would raise the issue again in a separate piece of legislation			1
it was unclear if the bid to separate the repeal provision from a larger defense authorization bill would increase its chances for approval			1
senate majority leader @entity21 , @entity22 , called thursday 's vote without an agreement with any @entity26 senators to support the motion , ensuring it would fail			1
the vote was 57 - 40 in favor of the cloture motion that required 60 votes to pass			1
a @entity26 filibuster forced @entity4 to seek a deal that would get them the necessary @entity26 support to get the 60 votes to proceed			1
the @entity4 caucus has 58 members , meaning they needed at least two @entity26 to join them to overcome the filibuster			2
@entity21 had been negotiating with moderate @entity39 sen. @entity39 of @entity40 for her support , and he postponed a planned vote wednesday to allow more time for the talks to reach agreement			2
however , @entity21 announced thursday he was calling the vote to open debate on the defense authorization bill , saying it was time to act on it after months of @entity26 obstruction and intransigence			2
@entity53 , apparently caught by surprise , missed the start of @entity21 's speech and requested a chance to question him on the @entity2 floor			0
she reiterated her support for repealing " @entity61 " and asked if the deal she had been discussing with @entity21 on wednesday still stood			0
@entity21 indicated he would honor parameters of the deal , which would allow @entity26 to offer up to 10 amendments along with ample time for debate , but he refused to make an outright commitment			0
he blamed @entity26 leaders for the situation and praised @entity53 for being the only @entity26 senator he could even speak to about a possible deal for her support			0
in response , @entity53 said , " i am perplexed and frustrated that this important bill is going to become a victim of politics			0
we should be able to do better			0
" the vote then proceeded , with @entity53 joining democrats in voting to open debate while one @entity81 , newly elected sen. @entity82 of @entity83 , voted with the filibustering @entity26			2
@entity82 's opposing vote killed any chance for the @entity4 to succeed			1
president @entity86 said in a statement that he was " extremely disappointed that yet another filibuster has prevented the @entity2 from moving forward " with the defense authorization measure that includes the repeal provision			1
noting support for repeal from the defense secretary , the @entity93 chairman and a majority of @entity98 , @entity86 said the " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy " weakens our national security , diminishes our military readiness , and violates fundamental @entity98 principles of fairness , integrity and equality , " @entity86 's statement said			1
" while today 's vote was disappointing , it must not be the end of our efforts , " @entity86 said			1
" i urge the @entity2 to revisit these important issues during the lame - duck session			0
" gay rights advocacy groups , including those comprising military personnel , immediately condemned the @entity2 vote			2
" today leaders of both parties let down the @entity98 military and the @entity98 people , " said @entity118 , president of the @entity119			0
" instead of doing what is right , ' the world 's greatest deliberative body ' devolved into shameful schoolyard spats that put petty partisan politics above the needs of our women and men in uniform			0
" this fight is too important to give up despite this setback and we will continue fighting in this lame - duck session			0
" sen. @entity139 , an independent from @entity140 who caucuses with the @entity4 , later said he believed that up to four @entity26 senators -- @entity53 , @entity142 of @entity143 , @entity144 of @entity145 , and @entity146 of @entity147 -- might support a separate repeal proposal that he will introduce with @entity53 and sen. @entity149 , @entity150			1
before thursday 's vote , @entity21 complained that all 42 of the @entity26 senators have pledged to block action on any measure before the chamber deals with extending @entity157 - era tax cuts and authorizing government spending for the rest of the fiscal year			1
the @entity4 strategy appeared to be to try to persuade @entity53 to vote for opening debate on the measure so that the two other @entity26 who also have expressed support for a repeal -- @entity142 and @entity144 -- also might do so			1
@entity144 announced her support for a repeal in a statement wednesday			0
@entity4 were pushing for action now because the new @entity169 in january brings a @entity26 - controlled @entity170 and a diminished @entity4 majority in the @entity2 , which will make repealing " do n't ask , do n't tell " more difficult			2
@entity53 said wednesday she had asked @entity21 to delay the vote until after the @entity2 completes work on the package of tax measures negotiated by the @entity170 and congressional leaders , which @entity26 consider a top priority in the final weeks of the lame - duck session that ends in early january			0
she also wanted @entity21 to schedule sufficient time to debate the defense authorization bill that contains the " do n't ask , do n't tell " repeal measure			1
both @entity21 and @entity53 , in their comments on the @entity2 floor thursday , acknowledged an agreement for the debate to include up to 15 amendments -- 10 by @entity26 and five by @entity4			1
however , @entity21 appeared to oppose the request to wait until the tax package had been passed			0
@entity86 has been calling senators in both parties to urge their support , @entity170 press secretary @entity191 said			1
before thursday 's vote , @entity191 told reporters that congressional repeal of " do n't ask , do n't tell " was the best way forward , and he believed it could happen before the end of the year			2
@entity86 has called for repealing " do n't ask , do n't tell " after years of debate on the policy that detractors consider discriminatory			2
more than 400 military personnel were discharged under the policy in 2009 , and a federal judge ruled it unconstitutional in a case that is under appeal			0
defense secretary @entity209 and @entity93 chairman adm. @entity210 both have urged @entity169 to vote for a repeal			2
the measure before the @entity2 , which has already gained approval in the @entity170 , contains a process for implementing the change that requires certification from the president , the defense secretary and the @entity93 chairman			0
@entity209 has warned that court challenges to " do n't ask , do n't tell " could force an immediate repeal of the policy , rather than the process in the legislation that would allow the military to manage the change on a longer timetable			0
@entity1 's @entity227 and @entity1 's senior congressional correspondent @entity228 contributed to this report .			0
