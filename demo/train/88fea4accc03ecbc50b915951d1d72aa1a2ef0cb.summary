" nobody on the outside world could have known what she meant			0
but inside @entity13 , a @entity15 code - breaking enclave in the @entity17 countryside of @entity18 , 18 - year - old @entity12 had discovered a vital piece of intelligence			1
working alongside thousands of other women to decipher encoded @entity25 signals sent between @entity27 generals , @entity22 's discovery meant passing on the information to her superiors to assess whether this was another piece of the decryption puzzle			2

a culture of secrecy far from being a group of experienced decoders , however , the estate 's recruits mainly consisted of young teenage military personnel , a smattering of crossword whizzes who had been able to complete @entity55 's puzzle in less than 12 minutes , and numerous 18 - year - old girls plucked from their quiet home towns			1
" it was the middle of the war when i received a call saying i was to go into war work to support @entity67 's efforts from home , " explains 88 - year - old @entity58 , a machine wire operator who served from 1942 until the end of the war			1
" a letter from the @entity70 then arrived saying i had an interview -- but i had no idea what it was for , and two weeks later , i was told i 'd be off to @entity74			2

" i had no idea how i 'd comply with it ! " but compliance was the only option , making these three young women -- @entity90 , @entity91 and @entity22 -- fierce guards of the country 's anonymous decoding history for several decades			1
indeed , it was n't until some thirty years later that @entity74 's long maintained shroud of secrecy began to lift , after the publication of " the @entity99 " -- a tell all book from former @entity102 officer @entity101 , who later became an @entity99 supervisor			1
the 1974 expose revealed how @entity99 intelligence had been used to intercept communication behind enemy lines and disseminate vital information to @entity67 and its allies			2
though @entity101 was accused of embellishing and aggrandizing his role in the tale , without his account , the real story of what went on inside the @entity67 's code - breaking operation may never have been known			1

" i was sent to live with a couple who were ordered to take me in because of the war			0
they never once asked me what i was doing there -- nobody did -- not even the local village workers who 'd serve us coffee at the @entity132 © on our lunch break , in spite of the fact a group of 18 - year - olds had suddenly arrived in this little hamlet , " she explains			0
" i only heard the name @entity141 -- the machine i was working on -- some three decades after the war ended , and it was n't until i later visited @entity13 that i said : ' this is where i worked , this is what i did ! ' " while @entity101 's revelations sent shock waves through the secretive decryption community , lifting the lid on what really happened inside the park ensued slowly and sporadically , with the bulk of the information being released in the early 2000s			1
" i 'm delighted that we can discuss our time there now that everything has come out , and i give talks on the subject whenever i 'm asked , " enthuses @entity90			0
" i 've given 97 to date ! " silent heroines for many of the young women at @entity74 , though , the removal of the clandestine veil came too late , with the majority of workers ' parents having passed away before the decryption effort became public knowledge			1
@entity22 , an 18 - year - old naval recruit who was sent to one of the park 's expansion locations in @entity174 -- on the outskirts of @entity176 -- was one of many who was never able to tell her loved ones about her contribution to the war			2
" you led two lives there , " she recalls			0
" one life was in @entity188 , where you ate in the canteen , and talked about boyfriends , and getting trains to @entity176 , and where to find black nylon stockings			0
" " @entity193 was where we worked , surrounded by high walls , barbed wire and two naval marines guarding the place			0
if you could make your voice heard over the noise of 12 @entity203 machines , that was the only time you would speak about work -- but you never would , " she explains			0
" i never knew what any of my coworkers were doing , and vice versa , and my parents never knew a thing of it			0
" after the @entity27 regime fell in 1945 , many of @entity74 's women returned home , while others stayed involved with the military 's work			1
@entity22 was given work as a wire destroyer : desoldering the many cables that had been painstakingly connected during intelligence operations throughout the war , while @entity90 was sent to the @entity223 to paraphrase translated @entity225 messages for transmission to officials			0
" upon leaving @entity74 , we really had no skills whatsoever , " remembers @entity22			0
" apart from how to keep a secret ! " and that secret was very nearly never told , especially after the original estate was due to be knocked down some 23 years ago , with houses and a supermarket planned to be built in its place			0
preserving @entity74 it was in may of 1991that @entity74 's fortunes changed , after a small local committee gathered a group of veterans at the park to say a final farewell to the historic location			1
but the group became determined to turn it into a heritage site after hearing the astounding stories of so many code - breakers , engineers and members of the @entity251 ( @entity251 ) who worked at the park during the war			1
the @entity255 was formed the following year , and from then on , regular reunions and exhibitions at the estate have enabled its former workers and inhabitants to share stories that were on the precipice of being lost forever			0
@entity101 's book might have been the first time that story of the @entity15 code - breakers entered the realm of popular culture , but it certainly was n't the last , with tv drama " @entity271 " proving popular in both the @entity67 and @entity270 earlier this year			1
with a second series on its way , and exhibitions at the @entity255 attracting visitors from around the globe , the world 's fascination with the once elusive @entity13 shows no sign of slowing			2
the culture of secrecy that once threatened @entity74 from being all but erased from the history books has well and truly ended			2
the @entity283 at @entity13 in @entity284 , @entity67 unveils its " women in computing " exhibit .			1

@entity13 was the home of @entity67 code - breaking during @entity15
the @entity283 based at the @entity74 estate launched a new exhibit on women in computing
@entity74 's fascinating history only became public several decades after the war ended
women made up majority of the *10,000* *people* who worked at secret code - breaking operation
