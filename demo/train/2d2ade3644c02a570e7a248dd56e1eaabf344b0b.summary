-- the commander of a military base has broad jurisdiction over the facility , including public roads and a special protest zone located on it , the @entity1 decided wednesday			1
the justices unanimously ruled against @entity9 , a longtime critic of @entity11 military policy who for 17 years has protested around @entity13 in @entity14			1
the court 's reading of federal law " reaches all property within the defined boundaries of a military place that is under the command of a military officer , " said chief justice @entity15			1
the power to secure portions of the base more tightly than others does " not change when the commander invites the public to use a portion of the base for a road , a school , a bus stop , or a protest area , especially when the commander reserves authority to protect military property by , among other things , excluding vandals and trespassers			1
" @entity9 's message of peace and the conflict it has created with @entity46 administration officials was at the heart of this free speech and boundary dispute			0
at issue was whether someone previously barred from a military base may be convicted under federal law for later " peacefully protesting " on a public road easement along the enclosed high - security facility			1
the appeal presented a fact - specific inquiry into such issues as " concurrent " government jurisdiction , public forums , and the limits of " exclusive control " asserted by the military			1
while the court 's ruling was a temporary setback for @entity68 , it did not address his larger contention that the federal law in question was unconstitutional			2
that issue will continue to percolate in the lower federal courts , and may yet give the 63 - year - old man a right to return to @entity13 , where location is integral to his message			1
@entity68 and wife , @entity80 , founded @entity81 in @entity82 , @entity14 , about a half - hour away from the base , which is along the @entity84 , northwest of @entity85			0
the @entity13 high - tech facility launches military satellites , operates aeronautical and space surveillance missions , and tests a variety of sophisticated weapons systems , including intercontinental ballistic missiles			2
running through its eastern boundary are state highways 1 and 246 , open to the traveling public			2
the federal government owns and operates the base , but the state and county have held a " use easement " for more than a half - century , and they maintain the roads			2
concurrent jurisdiction gives a measure of control of the narrow strip of land to all three entities			2
the @entity108 and their supporters from @entity110 , a group that opposes nuclear weapons , had conducted monthly peace vigils in a special open " protest zone " created along the @entity114 bisecting the base			0
a special green line is designed to mark an off - limits area			0
@entity13 's commanding officer in 2003 issued a " barment order " against @entity9 after he was arrested for trespassing and vandalism , including throwing blood on a base sign			0
a second " bar letter " was given four years later , after another trespassing incident			0
in 2010 , with the ban still in effect , @entity68 again entered the protest zone on repeated occasions , was told to leave , and was then escorted off the property			0
he says he has been arrested about 15 times			0
he sought to block the misdemeanor counts on free speech and other legal grounds			0
a federal appeals court eventually ruled in his favor , saying the special protest zone was not an area under the military 's " exclusive right of possession			1
" the @entity143 then asked the @entity1 to intervene , which has now ruled in the government 's favor			1
at the december oral argument and in its subsequent written ruling , the court rebuffed efforts by @entity68 and his attorneys to make this a predominately @entity153 case , and in effect limit a military commander 's discretion			2
" we decline @entity68 's invitation to require civilian judges to examine @entity11 military sites around the world , parcel by parcel , to determine which have roads , which have fences , and which have a sufficiently important , persistent military purpose , " said @entity15			1
" the use - it - or - lose - it rule that @entity9 proposes would frustrate the administration of military facilities and raise difficult questions for judges , who are not expert in military operations			1
and it would discourage commanders from opening portions of their bases for the convenience of the public , " he said			1
but justice @entity183 , while agreeing the base commander had authority to control any portion of the base within its borders , nevertheless suggested @entity9 's broader constitutional claims over his removal order may have merit			0
" it is questionable whether @entity9 's ouster from the protest area can withstand constitutional review , " she said			0
" the court has properly reserved that issue for consideration on remand , " meaning @entity68 may yet get another opportunity before the nation 's highest court someday			2
as for @entity68 , he told @entity0 his fight will continue			0
" they 're denying my right to dissent on their base , " he said			0
" they 're systematically trying to keep me out there , but i 'm not going away			0
" the case is @entity11 v. @entity9 ( 12 - 1038 ) .			1
