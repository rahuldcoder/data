@entity0 , @entity1 -- it 's an unusual setting for one of the world 's most modern aircraft -- a provincial @entity1 village with 19th - century charm , every two weeks @entity0 hosts a nocturnal procession of huge @entity5 parts on their way to the @entity8 assembly line			1
raising his hands as high and wide as he can , local resident @entity15 explains what it 's like to see the convoy of six individual parts that , when put together , form the largest passenger aircraft in the world			1
" when you see it in pieces , coming through a little village on the back of trucks , it looks bigger than the complete item , " he says			1
" it 's taller than the buildings			2
" watch video : tracking the @entity5 night convoy five years since its first commercial flight the double - decker plane is now a regular sight at most hub airports around the world			1
accommodating such a big bird was n't easy -- runways and taxiways were widened and strengthened , along with specially designed aircraft stands and extra baggage belts to cope with the suitcases of more than 500 passengers on a single flight			2
see also : ' @entity5 marks five years in the sky different parts of the plane are made all over @entity51 -- the rear fuselage in @entity53 , @entity54 , the wings in @entity56 , near @entity57 , @entity58 , the forward and middle fuselages in @entity61 , @entity1 and the horizontal tailplane in @entity63 , @entity64			1
everything apart from the tail fin and the nose cone is far too big to fly to the final assembly line at the @entity8 headquarters in @entity70 , southern @entity1			2
so @entity8 created a whole new method to move them			2
these key components are loaded onto specially designed ships that sail 2,000km in total across the continent to the delivery point at a harbor in @entity78 , 600km south of @entity79			1
the aeronautical cargo is then transported on modified barges along the @entity82 to @entity83 , where they are transferred onto trucks			1
it 's a journey that takes four days including the night convoy to the finish line			2
the component parts sit in sequence at a holding area in @entity92 11km away , where a team briefing is held for the 53 - man crew , 31 vehicles and 18 security - staff motorcade before the final leg of this mammoth journey squeezing through the little village of @entity0			1
i could tell you that the @entity5 is 18 meters wider and 5 meters longer than a @entity102 , that it has a wingspan of 79.8 meters and its tailfin alone is 24 meters high			1
but no matter what the numbers say or how often you see an @entity5 on the ground or in the air , the most impressive way to get some perspective on the size and scale of the @entity5 is to see it out of context -- unpainted , just its green protective coating , in individual parts , moving down the main street of a small @entity1 village , towering over roof tops and tree tops alike			1
it 's a fortnightly ritual for the locals and a midnight treat for tourists -- and with the manufacturing serial number in full view it takes planespotting to a whole new level			1
the convoy i joined -- @entity130 121 -- will become a @entity131			2
this was a paradise for aviation geeks , to be face to face with the @entity5			1
first to appear were each of the wings			2
laying on their sides , they looked like prehistoric creatures emerging from the darkness , stepping into the flood of light from the lamposts that lined the street			2
next up , the horizontal tailplane , then the three sections of the fuselage			0
slow and steady , in single file the parts crawl by			1
it 's over far too quickly			0
for first - timers like me , it was hard to stop watching one part of the plane and focus my attention on another			0
it was a natural reaction to want to walk along with the convoy , escorting the parts			1
seeing the plane in its basic primary form , it felt like everyone gathered along @entity165 was a part of the production process			0
at 2am , six pieces , all in a row , are safely delivered outside the @entity8 hangar to wait their turn to be put together , just like a kit of parts			1
the first stage is the structural assembly where the sections are fitted , including the landing gear			0
each part requires precision and patience ; it takes 13,000 rivets to join the three sections of the fuselage together and 4,000 rivets just to attach the wings to the body			0
watch video : inside the @entity5 assembly line the easiest way to identify who the planes belong to is by looking at the tail fins -- the only part at this stage that 's painted in the airline livery			1
then there is the next stage of the production process where the onboard equipment is installed and the engines fitted			0
the planes then make it outside in one piece for pressure and fuel testing			0
each airline has its own " build manager " to inspect and support every stage of the assembly			0
" we 're looking at the looming , all the ducting before the bulk heads go in , " said @entity211 , who started as a maintenance engineer with @entity131 25 years ago			0
" it 's very detailed in some places but it 's also a general walk around using the eye , a torch if you need to			0
" he added : " to see an aircraft start in its composite building blocks and slowly turn into an aircraft , it 's a fascinating experience and a learning experience			0
" after the fuel testing is complete , the plane was due to fly to @entity53 to be painted and fitted with the cabin interiors			0
this whole process takes eight months from final assembly until the keys are handed over and delivered			0
once one plane is ticked off the list , they start the process all over again			0
walking through the hangar of the final assembly line and catching a glimpse of one of the 1,500 engineers that work there , it 's almost as if the @entity8 headquarters was in @entity246 , taking care of the plane that @entity249 could have traveled in .			0

every fortnight huge @entity5 parts driven through the streets of @entity0
@entity5 parts made at different sites around @entity51
most parts are transported by ships , barge and trucks
locals , tourists and planespotters watch the parade of @entity5 parts
