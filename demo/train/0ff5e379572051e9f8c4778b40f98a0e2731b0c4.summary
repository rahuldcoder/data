even after apologizing for his department 's actions following @entity6 's shooting , the police chief of @entity1 , @entity2 , insisted thursday that he 's not going anywhere -- telling @entity8 , " this is mine , and i 'm taking ownership of it			1
" police chief @entity12 acknowledged that he 's heard calls for his ouster , but that does n't mean he 'll answer them			1
" i 've talked to a lot of people who have initially called for that and then changed their mind after having meetings and discussions about moving forward , " @entity12 said			2
" realistically , i 'm going to stay here and see this through			2
" by ' this , " he means taking a leadership role in a police department and a community that is still marred by discord and distrust of authorities -- especially among those in its large @entity35 - @entity34 community -- since the august 9 shooting			1
@entity6 was a 18 - year - old black teenager killed by @entity1 officer @entity38 , who is white			1
despite demands by protesters , @entity38 has not been charged in this case , though a grand jury is hearing evidence that could lead to an indictment			0
the shooting also stirred complaints of widespread racial profiling in @entity1 , which @entity12 rejected thursday			1
" it 's never been the intention of the @entity1 police department -- or any police department that i know -- to intentionally target individuals because of race , " said the chief			1
" if there is that happening , it 's a crime and it needs to be addressed			0
" chief ' sorry ' @entity6 's body was n't removed sooner @entity12 's interview with @entity8 came thursday afternoon , shortly after the release of his video apology to @entity6 's parents and the peaceful demonstrators who took to @entity1 's streets to protest @entity6 's death			1

i 'm also sorry that it took so long to remove @entity6 from the street , " he said during his video statement			1
investigators were doing " important work " trying to uncover the truth and collect evidence during those four hours , @entity12 said , but " it was just too long , and i 'm truly sorry for that			1
" " please know that the investigating officers meant no disrespect to the @entity6 family , to the @entity35 - @entity34 community or the people ( in the neighborhood where @entity6 was shot )			1
they were simply trying to do their jobs , " @entity12 said			2
asked thursday afternoon why the apology took so long , @entity12 told @entity8 , " there 's been so much going on , and every day there 's a different challenge			1
" he said he 's been wanting to apologize for " the time it took to remove @entity6 from the scene , " and he feels better now that he 's done it			1
" this is something that 's just been weighing on me			0
it 's something that needed to be said			0
it should 've been said a long time ago , " he told @entity8			0
feels ' responsible ' if peaceful protesters were ' upset ' dressed casually in a red polo shirt , @entity12 acknowledged in his video apology that most protesters who took to the streets of @entity1 following the shooting did so peacefully , even if there were others among them " who had a different agenda			1
" @entity12 singled out the peaceful protesters in his video			1
" the right of the people to peacefully assemble is what the police are here to protect			0
if anyone who was peacefully exercising that right is upset and angry , i feel responsible and i 'm sorry , " he said			0
he also acknowledged that the incident has sparked a larger conversation about societal issues , and he expressed interest in being part of the discussion			0
" overnight i went from being a small - town police chief to being part of a conversation about racism , equality and the role of policing in that conversation			1
as chief of police , i want to be part of that conversation			2
i also want to be part of the solution , " he said			0
he emphasized that " the city belongs to all of us " and conceded that @entity1 and the surrounding areas have " much work to do			2
" " for any mistakes i 've made , i take full responsibility			0
it 's an honor to serve the city of @entity1 and the people who live there			2
i look forward to working with you in the future to solve our problems , and once again , i deeply apologize to the @entity6 family , " he said			1
afterward , some @entity1 residents who 'd criticized police and backed the @entity161 expressed satisfaction with the apology , saying it needed to be said			2
others described it as too little too late , or at least called it useless unless @entity12 's words are backed up by actions to change things in @entity1			1
