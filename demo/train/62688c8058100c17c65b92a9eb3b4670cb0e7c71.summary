-- on @entity5 , between @entity2 and @entity3 in @entity4 , a monument stands with a plaque in honor of a brilliant thinker who is as responsible for the way we live our lives today as any person who has ever lived			2
his name is @entity16 , a @entity17 , and among his many credits and accolades , many historians refer to him as " the father of computer science			1
" when @entity24 listed him among its 100 most influential people of the 20th century , it said " that everyone who taps at a keyboard , opening a spreadsheet or a word - processing program , is working on an incarnation of a turing machine			0
" a pretty high honor to say the least			0
and yet in 1952 , while filing a robbery report with the police , @entity16 -- the man whose algorithms cracked the enigma code used by the @entity38 in @entity39 -- found himself arrested at his home in @entity41			1
his crime ? being gay			1
@entity16 was convicted of " gross indecency , " a felony in @entity46 at that time			1
he was forced to choose between prison and being injected with female hormones , a form of chemical castration			0
he reluctantly chose the latter			0
despite his accomplishments , he lost his job			0
and in june 1954 , he lost his will to live			2
if the western world is somewhat haunted by what @entity57 might have accomplished had cancer not taken him from us , we should be downright tormented by what we lost from the senseless excommunication of his predecessor			0
@entity16 's plaque is one of 18 that make up the city 's @entity65 , which honors @entity67 people who have made a contribution to history			1
it 's a reminder of where we were and how far we 've come			2
but as much as it seems the nation is talking about this topic , the fact remains that in much of the @entity77 , it is still legal to fire someone for the same reason that @entity16 was fired 60 years ago in @entity46			1
perhaps the prejudices in our rear view mirror may appear farther away than they actually are			0
so if you find yourself exhausted from all of this gay rights talk and want to leave a not - so - kind comment on a story , remember it 's because of an openly gay man that you even have the technology to do so			1
if you 're a black person who gets offended whenever the @entity92 is mentioned in the same sentence as the fight for gay rights , remember the rev. @entity97 's close confidant and most influential mentor was an openly gay black man by the name of @entity101			1
and if you ever find yourself wondering " how come there 's no @entity103 month ? " i say the day being straight becomes a crime -- as being gay still is in many parts of the world -- start one			1
gay pride was not born out of a need to celebrate not being straight but our right to exist without prosecution			1
just as @entity114 's " @entity118 " became the rallying cry against racism in the 1960s ; just as " i am woman , hear me roar " was the anthem against sexism in the 1970s ; " gay pride " is the banner that flies over a people whose dignity continues to be put to a vote in 2013			1
news coverage in june may focus on the celebratory nature of @entity82 parades , but it can not rewrite the history that made these parades an integral part of our survival			1
why is n't there @entity103 ? because @entity135 has yet to pass a law requiring people to hide the fact they are straight			1
because the streets are not filled with children who have been kicked out of their homes for being straight			2
because there seems to be a lack of stories in which someone has been beaten , tied to a fence and left to die or shot in the face at point blank range because they were straight			0
for this @entity82 month , sen. majority leader @entity149 , @entity150 , said he expects to take up legislation to address workplace discrimination " soon			1
" this month , the @entity153 may make a ruling on whether or not same - sex couples can marry			0
this month , 11 - year - old @entity156 wrote in a @entity158 op - ed that " during my first year in middle school , i experienced severe bullying			0
i was called terrible names that were quite hurtful			0
at that time , i had just realized that i 'm gay , and the bullies used the word ' gay ' as an insult			1
" this made me feel like being gay was horrible , but my parents told me otherwise			0
but as powerful as their love was , it could n't fight off all the bullying			0
i do n't want anyone else to feel the way i did			0
no one deserves that much pain , no matter who they are			0
so maybe instead of wondering why there is n't a straight pride month or movement , straight people should be thankful they do n't need one			2
i 'm sure @entity16 would have rather filed the police report and stayed home			2
i 'm sure @entity156 would prefer going to school in peace			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity191 .			2

@entity16 , " father of computer science , " killed himself , " convicted " of being gay
@entity191 : 60 years later , it 's legal in parts of @entity77 to fire someone for being gay
@entity202 : @entity82 month is a time to celebrate the right to live without *persecution*
the day being straight becomes a crime , @entity202 says , @entity103 will be born
