-- this year marks the 70th anniversary of " @entity2 , " and although we are a long way from 1942 , watching the film 's romantic leads , @entity3 and @entity4 , sacrifice their wartime love still touches us			1
the backstory on " @entity2 " is a good one , offering complex lessons in patriotism even today			1
few films have benefited as much from the real - world geopolitics surrounding them as " @entity2 , " which opened on @entity16 , when the nation was well into @entity18 , at @entity20 's @entity19			2
just 18 days earlier in @entity22 , the @entity21 had invaded @entity23 with a force of 65,000 ; among the cities they quickly captured was @entity2			1
a film that had finished production on august 3 suddenly became inseparable from actual events , as @entity30 , whose studio produced " @entity2 , " acknowledged in a november 10 memo , observing that the " entire industry envies us with picture having title ' @entity2 ' ready to release , and feel we should take advantage of this great scoop			2
" ( editor 's note : @entity41 , like @entity0 , is a subsidiary of @entity43 )			0
" @entity2 " was helped even further by the politics surrounding @entity22 , which at its outset involved getting @entity48 @entity47 forces in @entity23 to accept a ceasefire through a deal with adm. @entity51 , who had collaborated with the @entity52 after the defeat of the @entity48 army in 1940			1
the intrigue of " @entity2 " thus had its real - life counterpart in intrigue @entity58 had read about in their papers			2
" @entity2 " reminded @entity58 of how completely their thinking had changed in the months since @entity61			0
@entity62 had much to apologize for in its international affairs			0
in 1939 the @entity58 government failed to aid the @entity66 passengers on the @entity68 ocean liner @entity69 when they were denied entry into @entity71 and forced to return to @entity72 , and two years later the country was still not anxious to face facts about the wars raging in @entity72 and @entity76			0
in august 1941 the @entity77 only reluctantly voted to renew the peacetime draft , passing it by a single vote , 203 - 202			0
@entity3 's @entity2 is the embodiment of an @entity62 that has finally grasped the threat of fascism			1
on the surface , @entity84 is little more than the owner of a @entity87 © in @entity88 , who insists , " i 'm the only cause i 'm interested in			0
" but as his personal history emerges , @entity84 turns out to be anything but the cynic he pretends to be			2
before arriving in @entity2 , @entity84 fought on the @entity95 side in the @entity96 and ran guns for @entity98 in its fight against @entity101			1
at his @entity87 © he has made a point of hiring @entity72 refugees			0
he has a @entity105 pastry chef , a @entity68 refugee headwaiter , and a bartender from the @entity108			0
when a young @entity110 woman asks for his help in getting her and her husband to @entity62 , @entity84 comes to their rescue by allowing them to win the money they need for papers at his gambling table			0
the turning point in " @entity2 " occurs when @entity84 's former lover , @entity2 , played by @entity4 , shows up at his @entity87 © with the @entity122 resistance leader , @entity2 ( @entity123 ) , her husband			1
he still loves @entity125 , who acknowledges that she also loves him , but if he wants to help @entity2 escape from the @entity52 , he can not resume his relationship with @entity125 , who is @entity2 's main support			2
@entity84 's solution to his dilemma comes when he tells @entity125 that she should stay with @entity2 , then supplies the two of them with stolen letters of transit that will get them safely to @entity136			1
@entity84 's refusal to put his own needs before those of @entity2 -- and by extension the war effort -- reflects his priorities and his patriotism , but what makes @entity84 's sacrifice so powerful is that it is unaccompanied by chest pounding or sentimentality			1
" i 'm no good at being noble , " he tells @entity125 , " but it does n't take much to see that the problems of three little people do n't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world			0
" to help @entity125 and @entity2 escape , @entity84 must shoot the ranking @entity68 officer in @entity2 and reach an arrangement with the corrupt @entity48 chief of police			1
neither decision bothers @entity84 , who at the end of " @entity2 " heads off to a free @entity48 garrison with the police chief while telling him , " louis , i think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship			2
" the remark is filled with irony and humor , but remains serious			0
it reflects @entity84 's refusal to let the ambiguity of his choices get in the way of his waging war to the best of his ability			1
today , " @entity2 " speaks to audiences very differently from how it did in 1942 or even when it was part of the @entity3 revival that began in the late 1950s at the @entity182 in @entity183			2
" @entity2 's " call to arms and @entity3 's cool no longer resonate as they once did			1
but what does resonate in our post- 9/11 world is @entity84 's complexity			1
@entity84 is a loner who wo n't let his idealism get the better of his pragmatism			0
he will not give in to the @entity68 , who are the real power in @entity2 , but he refuses to do anything that needlessly exposes him to arrest			0
he walks a moral tightrope with understated brilliance			0
these days it is easy to imagine @entity84 applauding @entity62 's decision to aid @entity199 's rebels , worrying about our ongoing war in @entity202 , and wondering what we might do to get other countries to help us stop the bloodshed in @entity206			2
given @entity84 's choice of friends , it is clear that he would not be overly fastidious about choosing allies -- if he believed their cooperation could save lives			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity216 .			0

@entity218 : " @entity2 " turns 70 ; film had backstory , resonance that *mirrored* reality
he says @entity22 had just resulted in @entity21 ' capture of @entity2 ; gave film *currency*
he says @entity3 character had version of patriotism that was heroic , accepted ambiguity
@entity233 : @entity3 's cool may no longer resonate , but @entity84 's complexity does
