a shooting instructor is dead , the victim of a gun - range accident			1
a 9 - year - old girl is surely traumatized			1
and plenty of people , including many gun enthusiasts , are asking : why give a child a submachine gun to shoot ? the deadly incident occurred monday morning at a gun range in @entity11 that caters to @entity13 tourists , many of whom drive an hour from the gambling center to fire high - powered weapons			1
@entity18 was accidentally shot in the head as he instructed the 9 - year - old girl how to fire an @entity20 , an @entity21 - made 9mm submachine gun			1
as she pulled the trigger , the gun jumped out of her left hand toward @entity18 , who was standing beside her			1
" to put an @entity20 in the hands of a 9 - year - old ... is extremely reckless , " @entity28 law enforcement analyst @entity27 said			1
gun experts contacted by @entity28 on wednesday said young children should be taught to shoot with single - shot firearms rather than submachine guns			1
they also said that safe learning is connected to the ability and experience of the instructor			0
" it 's always the supervision , " said @entity39 , president of @entity41 - based @entity40			2
" but you also have gun enthusiasts running businesses where they place firearms in the hands of the uninformed , whether they 're 9 - year - old kids who are not capable or adults			1
it all stems from gun enthusiasts running businesses that require a level of professionalism and education			2
the unexpected with firearms is something that 's only learned through years of being a trainer , not a gun enthusiast			2
" representatives of the gun range declined @entity28 requests for comment on the incident			1
but @entity65 , who operates @entity66 and burgers , told @entity28 affiliate @entity68 on tuesday they " really do n't know what happened			1
" " our guys are trained to basically hover over people when they 're shooting , " @entity65 said			0
" if they 're shooting right - handed , we have our right - hand behind them ready to push the weapon out of the way			2
and if they 're left - handed , the same thing			2
" @entity18 had his right hand on the girl 's back and his left hand under her right arm when he was shot			1
opinion : why is a 9 - year - old firing an @entity20 ? @entity39 questioned why the instructor in @entity11 was standing immediately to the left of the @entity20 , which would have recoiled in that direction			1
" it 's an awful shame , " he said			0
" he should n't have been to the left side of the gun ... but that child should not have been shooting anything other than a single - shot firearm			1
" @entity39 , whose daughters are 11 and 13 , said his girls learned to shoot when they were 4 years old , with a single - shot , .22 - caliber pistol			1
@entity27 , who was a firearms instructor while he was with the @entity101 , said students are taught to fire in three - round bursts			2
it 's not like in the movies where somebody shoots 30 rounds nonstop , he said			0
" you 're going to lose control			0
" the wrong gun ? @entity112 , who runs @entity114 - based @entity113 , said not only was the @entity20 the wrong gun to use -- " that 's not a kid 's gun " -- but that instructors should stand to the rear and to the right of the shooter			1
" he was literally in the line of fire , " @entity112 said of the instructor			0
" he did pretty much everything wrong , and i do n't like saying that because it cost the man his life			0
" @entity128 , a @entity130 - based gun expert who runs @entity132 , said it was difficult to comment based on the limited information available about the @entity11 shooting , but added that the clip on the submachine gun should not hold more than three rounds during instruction			1
" teaching people machine gun 101 , even with adults , even with people going through military training , the first few times they shoot machine guns you do n't have them shoot a full freaking clip , " he said			1
" the thing begins to fire and it begins to jump and buck all over the place			0
your first human instinct is for your hands to clamp down , and you clamp down on the trigger and if the thing has a 32 - round magazine ... it starts spraying all over and people get killed			2
" some @entity20 submachine guns can be modified to control the powerful recoil			1
@entity128 said some submachine guns can be used to train children			2
" it can be done under the right circumstances , " @entity128 said			0
" there are some machine guns that i could have trained my 8 - year - old on			1
" the website of @entity66 and burgers , the shooting range where the accident happened , says children between the ages of 8 and 17 can shoot a weapon if accompanied by a parent or guardian			2
kids and guns : what 's your parenting style ? no charges to be filed chief deputy @entity182 attorney @entity181 told @entity28 on wednesday that prosecutors did n't foresee criminal charges			1
the @entity185 said the girl was with her parents			2

asked about the culpability of the girl 's parents , he said : " we have considered the parents , but if anyone was culpable it would be the instructor for putting a deadly weapon in her hands			2
