-- prison - issued toilet paper is what musician @entity2 used to write down most of his songs , including " @entity4 and lawyers , " which has just been released on @entity6			1
" i was arrested for murder on august 26 , 1981 , for a crime i did n't commit , " @entity2 tells his audience as he starts strumming his guitar			1
" i was released on november 18 , 2008			0
thank you to the keepers of justice			0
" according to @entity2 , justice prevailed when he was released from prison after 27 years			1
he is now on the @entity16 of @entity18 's list of 13 prisoners exonerated by dna evidence			1
it was @entity2 's life story and not his music that moved @entity24 winning music producer @entity25 to invite @entity2 to his @entity27 studio to record the songs he wrote in prison			1
" i was just blown away by this story , " says @entity25 , who learned about @entity2 's wrongful incarceration and his dream to record an album			1
" i just thought it was an injustice and i thought this guy deserves a break , " recalls @entity25 , adding that he did something he never does and reached out to @entity2			1
" i said whatever you bring me i am sure i can help you make it better , " @entity25 remembers telling @entity2 during their first conversation			1
not caring if he had any real talent , @entity25 arranged for @entity2 to spend a couple of weeks in the studio			1
@entity25 expected to make a cd for @entity2 to play while he was riding around in his truck			2
" i did this because i was compelled , " says @entity25 , " but when he came and i heard him sing i was just knocked out			0
" @entity25 says he quickly realized that @entity2 's life story might attract an audience , but his voice would turn them into fans			2
during those recording sessions , the talk often turned to @entity2 's fight , not only for his freedom but also his continuing battle for compensation			2
it was august 17 , 1981 , when @entity60 was found murdered on a @entity18 beach			2
the beach was in an area @entity2 frequented			2
the police questioned @entity2 about the murder and eventually investigators charged him for @entity60 's death			1
the 27 years @entity2 spent behind bars tested his will to survive			2
" i contemplated suicide many , many times			0
" he says that 12 years into his life sentence , he decided to let go of the anger			0
it was difficult for a man who eventually learned he would be paroled in 2043 , when he would be in his 80s			0
while in prison at @entity77 facility , @entity2 helped develop a music program			1
he learned to play the guitar and sang with fellow inmates in a band			0
music was a main focus of @entity2 's when in 2006 a law clerk asked him if he had ever had his dna tested			1
that test would be the key to his freedom			0
" in @entity94 's case , there was much evidence that pointed away from him having committed this crime , " says @entity89 of the @entity16 of @entity18 , the group that helped secure @entity2 's release			1
at the time of his release , @entity2 's time behind bars was longer than any other person exonerated in the @entity103 , according to the @entity16			2
@entity2 assumed that when he gained his freedom he would be compensated for the time he spent in prison			1
" if you are releasing me from prison on dna , for a crime i did n't commit , you should be handing me the money so i could get on with my life , " says @entity2			1
that did n't happen and @entity2 has been relying on the kindness of others			2
@entity18 has a compensation law that pays $ 50,000 per year to those who are classified as wrongfully incarcerated			2
@entity2 , like almost all the @entity16 of @entity18 's 13 dna cases , does n't qualify for the money			1
in order to receive compensation in @entity18 , an exonerated person must have " clean hands			2
" this means the person can not have a felony on record from before they were wrongfully imprisoned			0
" when i was 19 years old i got caught with a quaalude and a joint in my pocket with nine college kids coming from a bottle club at 4 o'clock in the morning , " says @entity2			2
@entity2 believes that arrest cost him more than $ 1.3 million from the state			1
@entity2 's efforts to get a claims bill passed through the @entity134 have been unsuccessful			0
earlier this year , @entity135 , @entity136 , released his final report to the @entity139 president			0
@entity135 noted that state attorney @entity140 wrote a letter stating he did not think dna testing exonerated @entity2			1
@entity135 's final report also makes a reference to @entity146 deputy @entity145			0
@entity147 worked on the @entity2 case			0
now retired , the report notes that @entity147 continues to believe @entity2 murdered @entity60			0
in his conclusion , @entity135 notes that his burden of proof is a " preponderance of the evidence " and recommends that @entity2 be compensated for his years in prison			1
the report says , " there is no physical evidence linking @entity2 to the victim or the crime scene and @entity2 would probably not have been found guilty with the credible evidence available to the prosecutors			1
" as his attorneys continue to try to get his compensation bill passed by both the @entity165 and @entity139 , @entity2 continues to make music			0
he dreams of having the ability to make money with his music			0
but @entity2 says he is realistic about the odds of being able to support himself in the entertainment industry			0
" i am hoping , " says @entity2			0
" i would love it but i just do n't know			0
" what @entity2 does know is that his first album is slated for release this summer and he is already thinking about what he is going to write about in his next musical endeavor			0
" i want to put the soul and feeling i have into songs of everyday life , " says @entity2			1
" i see the world with baby eyes			0
i do n't see the world like you see the world because i just started living in it			0
