-- if you plan on watching the @entity3 , there is one aspect of the game that can be predicted with absolute certainty : you 'll be bombarded with instant replays so continuously that you 'll stop noticing they 're there			1
i 'm not referring to the occasional replays that determine whether an official on the field has made the right call			2
those usually come at dramatic junctures			2
the instant replays that will wash over you are the routine ones we 've all become accustomed to in every televised sport : the rebroadcast , usually in slow motion , of the play that has just occurred			1
the block that cleared the way for a 30 - yard gain , the catch made in traffic just before the defenders level a receiver ... we take it on faith that as soon as a play has ended , we 'll likely see it from a different angle again ( and again ... and again )			2
a case can be made that instant replays , while an enjoyable tool for watching sporting events , have worked their way into the wider nonsporting world in ways that are far from beneficial			1
in the context of the streets and homes of the @entity48 , they are not an unmixed blessing			2
there was a time when instant replay had never been seen by @entity48 sports fans			1
if you watched a game on television , you had to pay pretty close attention			1
if you missed the touchdown run , the buzzer - beating basket , you were n't going to see it again before the game concluded			0
this made for a lot of dead air between plays			0
then , on dec. 7 , 1963 , during the @entity69 , a @entity68 sports director named @entity70 , using newly available videotape technology , showed an @entity73 touchdown for a second time right after the runner crossed the goal line			1
broadcast lore has it that play - by - play announcer @entity80 , not wanting viewers to be confused , yelled into his microphone : " this is not live ! ladies and gentlemen , @entity73 did not score again ! " what happened in the ensuing years , you know about			0
instant replay became an integral part of sports broadcasts			1
if a game were to be telecast today without instant replays , it would appear incomplete and unsatisfying			1
as instant replay became so ubiquitous on sports telecasts , a subtle shift occurred in everyday life			1
we had become used to seeing everything that transpired on athletic fields shown over and over ; if we did n't see the big play the first time , it did n't matter , because we knew we 'd be seeing it again right away			0
and before long , we began to demand the same thing from life itself			0
instant replay capability became available to all of us			1
the ramifications of this , it can be argued , have turned out to be complicated and less than ideal			0
moments have ceased to be momentary			0
life has turned into dress rehearsal			0
first came home - video cameras ; people at family gatherings began to pop the tapes into @entity119 playback machines as the parties were still in progress , reliving celebratory toasts while the guests still had the drinks in their hands , scrutinizing themselves on screens before memories had even begun to form			1
camera phones took this into new territory ; every person with a phone became as powerful as @entity70 in that @entity68 control room , able without delay to immediately transmit moving pictures to networks of acquaintances , or to public video - posting sites , for viewing by anyone in the world			0
on one level it 's a marvelous development , endlessly fascinating			0
yet there is this nagging feeling that real life has been converted into a series of moments that are no longer expected to be here and gone , but instead are regarded as first run - throughs : performances that will be witnessed repeatedly , on demand			0
when you habitually view the world through the lens of a digital camera , knowing that it will take only seconds for you to transform something that has not yet happened into something that , in theory , will live forever , you inadvertently are accomplishing something else : you are altering , devaluing , the meaning of " now			0
" we cease paying quite so much attention to what 's taking place around us , to savoring it , because we have become conditioned to believe that there is nothing that wo n't come around again in rerun -- probably within minutes			1
knowing that the odds are slim that if we miss something we 'll really miss it , we do n't focus as sharply			0
the replay , paradoxically , seems more authentic than the original act			1
there 's no going back ; @entity70 may or may not have been aware of what he started during that army - navy game in 1963 , but what commenced that day was the beginning of the end of the concept of here - and - gone			2
security cameras are mounted in so many places today that , on city streets and in stores and office buildings , you 're on stage more constantly than @entity191 or @entity192 ever were in the early days of television			2
your every movement is being recorded just as precisely and diligently as those of the wide receiver who stretches to put the football over the goal line in the @entity3			0
for all that has been gained with this , something essential has started to drift away : the idea that a moment is a moment , transitory and somehow more precious because it 's never coming around again			2
these days , you ca n't be sure that it will ever leave			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity207 .			1

on dec. 7 , 1963 , a television sports director introduced the instant replay
@entity207 says that event changed sports broadcasting -- and more
he says people expect that every moment of their lives can be replayed
@entity207 : something was lost when the " here and gone " nature of reality *vanished*
