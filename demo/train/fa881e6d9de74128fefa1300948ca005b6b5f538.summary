-- four @entity2 nationals will stand trial in @entity4 friday in what officials describe as the most serious ever @entity8 terrorist plot in @entity9			1
the alleged plot , which counter-terrorism officials in the @entity12 and @entity9 believe was directed by @entity14 operatives in @entity15 , targeted @entity16 , the @entity4 - based newspaper responsible for publishing controversial cartoons of the @entity18			1
the four persons are alleged to have planned a gun attack on the newspaper , followed by " the execution " of hostages			1
the cell 's alleged plans were thwarted by a joint operation by @entity2 and @entity28 security services , which tracked the alleged terrorists as they drove from @entity2 to @entity28 in december 2010 , with a submachine gun , a silencer , and several dozen 9mm submachine gun cartridges			1
the four persons - @entity34 , 46 , of @entity36 descent , @entity37 , 31 , of @entity39 descent , @entity40 , 39 , of @entity36 descent , and @entity42 , 32 , of @entity44 descent - are charged with plotting to kill a large number of people at the newspaper			1
they have denied the charges			0
western security services believe the plot was part of a broader @entity14 conspiracy , authorized by @entity53 , to strike @entity54 with attacks mirroring @entity15 terrorist group @entity58 's @entity57 attack in november 2008 , which killed nearly 200 people			1
in october 2010 , the @entity60 issued an unprecedented travel advisory warning @entity12 of the potential for a similar attack in @entity54			0
@entity34 , the suspected ringleader of the cell , @entity37 , and @entity40 had all travelled to @entity15 in early 2010			0
@entity37 and @entity40 - travelling separately - were arrested by @entity15 authorities in august 2010 before they could reach @entity67 and were subsequently deported , according to a @entity2 counterterrorism source			1
@entity34 evaded capture , and he is believed to have received training in @entity15 and then went to @entity2 shortly before the group allegedly began to plot their attack , according to the source			1
@entity37 , the @entity39 - born suspect , had long been on the radar screen of @entity2 counter-terrorism services			1
he was suspected of having joined up with jihadist militants in @entity77 in 2006 , before fleeing the country when @entity80 troops launched a military operation against @entity8 militants there , according to a @entity28 security source			2
by october 2010 , @entity2 security services had begun tracking the cell , placing listening devices in their apartments			2
a @entity2 counter-terrorism source told @entity0 the group only settled on attacking the newspaper shortly before the planned attack , and often squabbled			1
on the evening of december 28 , 2010 , three of the alleged cell members set off from @entity93 in a silver @entity95 rental car with @entity34 at the wheel			0
security services continuously monitored the progress of their vehicle , including from the air			0
@entity40 bailed from the journey at the last minute , and was later arrested in @entity93 , according to court documents			0
it was just after 2 a.m. when their vehicle crossed the iconic @entity107 bridge connecting the two countries			0
when they reached @entity4 , they were initially unable to find the address where they planned to sleep			2
just after 10 a.m. on december 29 , @entity28 police , concerned the men may be about to try launch their operation , moved in to make the arrests			0
authorities had already taken precautions			0
when they learned the group was planning to travel down to @entity28 to allegedly carry out the operation , they secretly disabled their weapons , according to a @entity2 counter-terrorism source			2
plastic wrist strips were also found in their car , according to court documents , and security services said they believed the materials were going to be used to handcuff hostages			0
security services believe the plan was to try to take up to 200 journalists hostage at the newspaper and execute many of them , a @entity2 counter-terrorism source told @entity0			1
" our assessment is that their plan was to try to get access to the @entity16 building and carry out a @entity57 - style attack , " the head of @entity28 's intelligence service , @entity139 , said in a press conference after the group was arrested			1
cash amounting to $ 20,000 was also recovered from the suspects , and a pistol and ammunition were found in one of their apartments , according to court documents			0
the trial may shed light on what officials believe are connections between the alleged plotters and @entity14 terrorists in @entity15			2
in total , police made more than a thousand recordings of the plotters ' conversations , some of which are expected to be played in court			0
a @entity2 counter-terrorism source has told @entity0 that investigations have revealed a complex set of connections between the plotters and a network linked to @entity175 , a senior @entity15 @entity14 operative who @entity177 intelligence believe orchestrated @entity14 's plans to hit @entity54 with @entity57 - style attacks			2
@entity2 security services established that @entity37 , the alleged @entity39 - born plotter , moved in the same circle as " @entity182 , " a @entity93 - based militant of @entity185 descent who is suspected of acting as facilitator for @entity175 's terrorist network , according to a @entity2 counter-terrorism source			1
also involved with @entity175 's network was @entity191 , an @entity12 of @entity15 descent who pleaded guilty two years ago to helping plot the @entity57 attacks			0
according to an interview of @entity191 by @entity198 's @entity197 that was obtained by @entity0 , @entity191 met with @entity182 in 2009 in relation to a plot @entity191 himself was planning against the @entity16 newspaper			1
the newspaper and its cartoonists has been targeted by several plots in recent years , including a plot by a @entity207 @entity14 cell broken up in july 2010			2
western counter-terrorism officials say that despite the reported death of @entity175 in a drone strike in june 2011 , @entity14 has not given up its hope to launch gun and hostage execution attacks in @entity54 because of the huge publicity and fear such attacks would create .			0
