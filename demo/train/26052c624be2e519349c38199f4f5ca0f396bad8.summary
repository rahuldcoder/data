-- two weeks before @entity3 's 93rd birthday on july 18 , actress @entity1 sits on a couch near her home in @entity6 , @entity7 , reminiscing about the first time she met him			1
already an activist and a leading voice against apartheid , @entity1 introduced @entity3 at a fundraising event in 1990 during his first trip to the @entity15 after his release from prison			1
" by the time i got on stage , i literally started to hop around ... i could not stop the electricity in my body , " she said			0
" so i went and i wrapped my arms around him , and i said to him in his ear , ' oh @entity3 , @entity3			1
how are you ? have you eaten ? have you slept ? ' and it became a really funny thing because ' nobody has asked me that , @entity1 , in my entire travels , ' " @entity1 said with a laugh			1
" so that sort of became the basis of our relationship			0
" long before they met , @entity1 's passion for social justice in @entity37 had been growing since she was a student at @entity39			1
by 1989 , she joined a handful of artists and actors , such as @entity43 and @entity44 , to found what is now called artists for a @entity47 ( @entity48 )			1
they used their celebrity platform to shine a light on apartheid and lobby for sanctions against the regime			0
" once apartheid was crushed ... one of the things @entity3 said to us was , ' you 've helped us in our struggle to defeat apartheid , but right now we 're facing another formidable foe -- and that is the @entity63 , ' " she said			1
" so we 've morphed through the years of how we 've wanted to be of assistance			0
" @entity48 shifted its mission and in 2005 created an orphan care program called " @entity67 " to help around 3,500 @entity69 orphans in @entity37			1
while working to combat the disease , @entity1 's relationship with @entity3 has grown both as an activist and a friend			1
she remembers receiving an invitation to a state dinner at the @entity77 when @entity78 was president -- not from @entity78 himself but from @entity3 , who was being honored there			2
" we were in the receiving line ... and he sees me about three people away and he leans over and he goes ' @entity1 , @entity1 ! remember me ? it 's @entity3 , " she said			1
" and i said , ' @entity3 , i do n't think anybody will ever forget you and certainly not me			2
" other times , their dinners were less formal			0
" we continued to do political work together ... and i 'd always had the blessing and good fortune to be able to have a private meal with him			0
the first one was after he became president			0
" the thing about @entity3 is that immediately it 's like having an audience with your ancestors ... because he recognizes you as a young person but he talks to you and expects things of you as an equal			2
and i think when people expect things of you , you realize that you 're capable of it and you can do it			0
" during one of @entity1 's trips to @entity37 , she toured @entity110 , where @entity3 spent many of his 27 years in prison			1
" after hearing so much about it , it 's this big , evil fortress that sucks the life out of good people ... i thought i would get there and be angry , " she said			0
" as @entity119 [ a @entity37 politician who spent 18 years in prison on @entity110 ] walked us through the cellblocks and talked about life there , he completely transformed the whole notion of imprisonment			1
i realized you could not be imprisoned			0
but these men decided not to be in prison			2
and for me , it almost became a sacred place			0
" i think what @entity3 has demonstrated to all of us is not what he was capable of but what every single person is capable of ... it does n't matter what circumstance you 're put into			2
it 's how you respond to circumstance			0
" he gives us that not as an icon but as a human being , as a man , as a grandfather , as a father , as a person , as a @entity3 to everybody			2

@entity1 greeted @entity3 on his first trip to the @entity15 after his release from prison
