-- it 's safe to assume that most people outside @entity3 had never even heard of @entity4 until a few weeks ago			1
if they had , there 's a good chance it was thanks to some beautifully flowing song or instrumental by one of the country 's many world - renowned musicians : @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 ... the list is long			1
if it was n't music then it might have been @entity4 's priceless medieval manuscripts that drew their attention , or its majestic mud - built mosques , its filmmakers , poets , photographers and writers			1
like @entity31 or @entity32 , @entity4 's music and culture are its primary asset , its shop - window to the world , its " gold and cotton " as one famous musician put it			1
certainly , very few people would have included the words " @entity4 " and " @entity44 " in the same sentence before april last year , when @entity44 militia took control of over two thirds of the country and started amputating the hands of thieves , stoning adulterers and whipping women who happened to venture out into the streets ' improperly ' dressed			1
with the arrival of @entity57 forces and the mass hostage seizure at the @entity60 oil facility of @entity61 , @entity4 and @entity44 are two words that now appear not only to be inextricably linked but on the front page			1
six reasons why @entity4 matters of course , the association goes back much further than april 2012			2
@entity66 and the @entity67 ( @entity68 ) moved south from @entity60 and into @entity4 's remote northern deserts over a decade ago			1
it proceeded to amass a fortune from kidnapping , smuggling and money laundering whilst undermining the local economy , disrupting social relations and destroying the local tourist industry			0
it brought along a hardcore form of @entity80 inspired by @entity81 and a hatred of the @entity3 that was previously almost unheard of in @entity4 , a country which has long contented itself with gentler and more tolerant brands of @entity84 richly tinted by local @entity86 beliefs			2
@entity68 also managed to hijack a rebellion against the central government in @entity89 by the nomadic @entity91 people of the north that had been grinding on and off for the best part of fifty years			0
this conflict , which first erupted in 1963 , was always about power , influence and the self - determination of a marginalized people			2
it was also about preserving the @entity91 's unique @entity101 culture			2
it had never been about imposing hard line @entity80 on anyone			0
but from round 2006 onwards , @entity91 nationalism and @entity80 terrorism became inextricably confused with each other			0
why @entity3 backs @entity57 in @entity4 indeed , there 's a widespread theory , confirmed by the word of just a few bit - players in the drama but lacking any more conclusive evidence , that certain parties who were utterly averse to the idea of an independent @entity91 state -- the @entity4 government , @entity60 and others -- either deliberately implanted @entity68 in the region , or at the very least tolerated its presence there			1
it was hoped that the strategy would attract military aid and doom the @entity91 nationalist project to failure			0
the theory might seem strange given the damage that terrorism has wrought in both @entity4 and @entity60 but most @entity91 i know accept it as gospel			2
we 'll probably never know the whole truth			0
what 's certain is that the @entity134 is one of the hardest places on earth for an outsider to understand			0
its interlocking cogs of power and influence -- geopolitical , regional , governmental , tribal , mineral , criminal , spiritual , clan and family -- are fiendishly complex			0
no foreign intervention can hope to achieve any long - term benefits if it can not get to grips with the underlying political and social mechanism of this vast region			0
2011 brought the @entity152 and the end of @entity154 , who had long been a stabilizing force in the @entity156 , and both a promoter and a hinderer of @entity159 ambitious			0
his weapons arsenals were opened up to armed groups of every stripe and in january 2012 , the @entity91 used this opportunity to reignite their rebellion in northern @entity4			2
but it was @entity68 who eventually took control , either directly or through a network of alliances			0
now @entity4 's hopes lie with the @entity57 , who intervened on friday january 11 , after months of diplomatic wrangling at the @entity174 and elsewhere			1
@entity57 ' not a pacifist nation ' so the world has a new front on the global war on terror and @entity57 has a new battle to fight in @entity3			0
within northern @entity4 itself , however , and throughout the @entity182 world , this is not seen as a war on terror but as a cultural conflict , one that pits a group of people who feel that the future of their society will be best served by rejecting @entity193 liberal values and returning to the core tenets of @entity80 against another group who believe in religious tolerance , secularism , democracy and music			1
this conflict turns musicians , artists and writers into frontline soldiers			1
@entity206 destroyed its mausoleums and silenced its musicians decades , even centuries , ago			0
in the @entity60 civil war of the 1990s , many musicians , writers and cultural figures were killed , prompting others to flee overseas			2
in @entity4 they 're still singing , still writing , still fighting , for the time being at least			1
in this new battleground in the cultural wars of the @entity182 world , a distant mirror of the religious wars that shook @entity220 in the 15th and 16th centuries , @entity4 musicians are taking a stand			1
that 's why music matters			0
that 's why @entity4 matters			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity228 .			0

until recently , @entity4 was better known for its music , mosques and manuscripts than for conflict
@entity228 : music and culture are @entity4 's shop - window to the world , its primary asset
conflict turns musicians , artists and writers into frontline soldiers , says @entity228
@entity228 : in @entity4 they 're still singing , still writing , still fighting
