-- ok , readers , let 's have a debate , one of sports talk 's favorites			2
who is the best player in the @entity9 ? is it @entity11 , @entity12 or @entity13 ? scroll down to the comments and sound off			1
... all done ? good			2
now , how many of you called me short - sighted ( or " @entity20 - loving imbecile , " if you 're a troll ) for neglecting to include the @entity18 ' @entity17 ? not many , i venture , at least not if you 're outside the @entity22			1
but how can he objectively be omitted from the debate ? " his game is shrouded in fundamentals and not athleticism , " said former @entity9 sharpshooter @entity25 , a @entity26 analyst who will call saturday 's game 6 between @entity28 and the @entity29			1
" what he does is n't flashy , is n't explosive			2
he does n't want to be in the spotlight			2
" yet he 's a winner			1
that ca n't be argued , and with his @entity39 © , it 's curious he does n't get more credit -- and that less - talented fellows like @entity42 get more press , even if it 's because of their antics			1
fans profess to yearn for good guys , yet when presented with a stalwart , they yawn or change the channel			2
the recent news of @entity17 's possible divorce from his wife of 11 years is one of the few , maybe only , instances of off - court negative press in his career			1
@entity25 , whose 15 - year playing career included four seasons with @entity17 and the @entity18 , said he ca n't explain it			1
" why do people watch reality tv ? why do people watch the @entity62 ? just consider your audience , " he said			1
" it 's true that there 's a fairly hypocritical nature , not just to sports fans but human beings			0
it 's human nature to be fascinated by the bizarre or the crazy or the flashy and not the mundane			0
" for 16 years , the two - time @entity73 has averaged a double - double , tallying about 20 points and 11 rebounds ( plus more than three assists and two blocks ) per outing			0
@entity12 , @entity11 and @entity13 have impressive career stat lines but not double - doubles			0
@entity17 's numbers are a smidgeon higher in the playoffs , which his @entity18 have reached in every season since he joined the roster			1
none of the @entity88 has reached the postseason every year			0
then there are those rings : four of them , 1999 , 2003 , 2005 and 2007			0
@entity12 has one , @entity11 none			0
@entity13 has five , a feat @entity17 's teammates hope he will soon match as the @entity18 sit at home waiting to learn who they 'll face in the @entity98 after dismantling the @entity99			1
why well - rested @entity18 have edge in @entity98 " @entity17 has laid the groundwork for how he wants his @entity9 career to be handled , " @entity26 and @entity102 analyst @entity101 said , explaining that @entity17 has chosen to stay in one of the league 's smallest markets , alongside a coach he trusts , @entity106			1
before we delve any deeper , @entity101 , who spent a collective 15 years coaching the @entity111 , @entity99 and @entity112 , would like to make one thing clear : @entity11 does n't belong in this debate			0
" it 's unfair to compare @entity11 with @entity17			1
@entity17 is the model of longevity , consistency and championships , " he said			2
" is he a top three or four player ? yes , without question , but you ca n't include him in this conversation			0
what has he done in the playoffs that puts him in with @entity17 ? " fair enough			2
we 'll talk again in five years			0
are you starting to see why the he 'll never be voted prom king ? the father of two simply does n't care about such things -- popularity , ratings			0
he cares only about @entity133 , and to many fans , that is n't sexy unless a player makes an ass of himself or talks trash incessantly			0
@entity139 's and @entity141 's @entity140 , a @entity142 fan , posted a rare ( for sportswriters ) ode to @entity17 this week			1
in it , he called the @entity18 power forward the best player of his generation , better than @entity13 , a guy who " probably led the league for 16 straight years just in throwing an arm around a teammate 's shoulder			1
" " it 's the little things that make him special			0
offensively , he can destroy you in the low post , he can run perfect pick and rolls with any decent guard and when all else fails , he can just bank that pretty 15 - footer			0
seriously , does anyone else in basketball have that shot ? " @entity140 asked in the video			0
" since 1997 , you never heard about @entity17 dogging it , calling out teammates , showing up heavy for training camp , complaining about money , asking for a trade , giving himself a nickname			2
of course , people found that boring			0
since when was winning boring ? " it 's a fine question and one that @entity178 , editor - in - chief of the @entity18 blog pounding the @entity181 , has heard before			1
after reading a @entity0 story from last year about the @entity18 ' supposed inability to tantalize , he handed the rock thursday to one of his blog 's longtime commenters , @entity186 ( bold and italics imparted by the commenter ) : " ... the whole ' @entity17 is boring ' argument is so effing tautological			1
no , he 's not boring			0
because you never feature him			0
can he be charming and funny ? of course he can			0
is he a fighter and a champion ? you best believe it , and if you do n't , look up			0
see those banners ? and the emotion he shows on the court is that much more powerful for being rare			0
you can promote that , you capitalist a-holes , if the money that promotion brings is really all that matters to you about this game			0
you can promote anything if you come at it from the right angle			0
but you 're lazy , @entity9 suits , and you like to keep the public lazy , and you take the path of least resistance â € ” entertainment over enlightenment			2
" @entity178 also believes the " boring " argument overlooks that the @entity18 ' style of play is by design			1
it 's not that @entity106 is averse to the flashy , @entity178 said ; it 's more that he 's " anti-bad play , " and the path to victory is rarely paved with quadruple crossovers , one - handed alley - oops and no - look - behind - the - back passes			1
pop and @entity17 also famously avoid the media , a practice that might not jibe well with larger markets like @entity228 and @entity229			1
@entity178 recalls one of his contributors , @entity232 , telling him last year he saw @entity17 actually pump a fist -- a gametime rarity over the big man 's career -- after realizing that no reporters wanted to talk to him in the locker room after a playoff game			1
even on @entity17 's website , there is an faq largely about his personal life that , tellingly , has n't been updated since @entity17 was 27 , about a decade ago			1
his milquetoast answers average 4.6 words and include this bombshell : asked what wish he 'd want granted if given the choice , he replied , " good health			0
" as opposed to his own island or a solid - gold @entity251			0
" they do n't play to the press			2
that means there 's less meat for the marketing machine to chew up and process , " @entity255 said			2
" the @entity18 ' entire organization , they really think it 's a distraction			1
the rest of that stuff is external to their job of winning games			0
" and since 1997 , when the 6 - foot - 11 @entity269 grad first donned the silver and black as the @entity9 draft 's no. 1 overall pick , no @entity274 sports team has done that job better			1
it 's hard to imagine that 's not primarily a product of @entity17 's no - nonsense efficiency , though @entity101 points out that @entity106 and the @entity18 ' front office -- as well as the personnel it 's paired with @entity17 -- deserve credit			1
what will fifth ring mean for @entity17 's legacy ? to truly appreciate @entity17 , you have to take the long view			1
so where does he rank among players all time ? we 'll start with @entity25 because of his credentials			2
sure , @entity101 coached greatness in @entity294 and others , but @entity25 won titles with the @entity18 and with @entity299 's @entity298 teams , so he 's actually passed greatness the ball			1
@entity25 said @entity302 , @entity299 and @entity303 fill out his top three , " and at that point , you can throw @entity17 up against anybody , in my mind			1
" a fifth title -- should the @entity18 dispatch the winner of the @entity312 - @entity29 series -- would elevate @entity17 to @entity314 status because of the time between trophies			1
@entity314 won six championships between 1971 and 1988			0
" @entity318 players normally do n't win until they reach their prime			2
... titles come in a cozy span of six to eight years , not 13 , " @entity25 said			2
" it speaks to his brilliance over his entire career			0
" @entity101 sees it similarly and puts @entity17 in the top five of all time , along with @entity25 's top three and @entity314			1
" @entity17 certainly belongs in that company			2
it 's rarefied air that he 's in , " he said			0
@entity178 said " the greatest ever " debates are heavily dependent on " who 's talking , where they 're talking and who they 're talking to			1
" he 's not sure , as a @entity18 blogger , how much mileage he can derive by putting @entity17 in an all - time team of players at every position , he said			1
he and the other contributors to pounding the @entity181 , however , confidently call @entity345 , " an acronym ( sort of ) for @entity344			0
told of @entity101 's and @entity25 's assessments , @entity178 softened his resistance to ranking his team 's perennial all - star			1
" i would n't disagree with those guys , " he said			2
" the top five is an excellent place for him			0
" @entity26 , @entity102 and @entity0 are owned by the same parent company , @entity354 .			0

*experts* : @entity17 is often left out of " greatest in @entity9 " debates for no good reason
spurs await winner of @entity312 - @entity29 series ; finals win means fifth ring for @entity17
@entity25 , on why we do n't like nice guys : " why do people watch the @entity62 ? "
