when i was 13 , i was sold			1
friends of my father worked for a corrupt adoption agency operating in my homeland of @entity5 -- friends my father trusted			1
in 2006 they coerced him into believing he was sending my younger sisters and me to @entity11 for an educational program during which we would come home every summer and on school breaks			1
little did my father know that his " friends " were being paid to recruit children for an @entity11 adoption agency			1
in fact , he did n't even know what " adoption " meant			1
instead of an educational program , we found ourselves caught up in an international adoption scandal			1
we were n't the only ones lied to			1
the family who adopted us , who lived in the southwestern @entity11 , were told that they were taking into their family three @entity29 orphans , the oldest of whom was nine years old			1
the truth was that our mother had died from complications during childbirth , and our father was alive and well			0
instead of nine , i was 13 years old ; my sisters were 11 and six			1
our new " parents " changed our names and told us we could no longer speak to each other in our own languages ; we were punished if we disobeyed			0
eventually , we forgot how to speak our native languages , @entity43 and @entity44			0
i was so young and na√Øve			0
i actually believed that if i ran away , i could walk back to @entity5			1
i wanted to escape from the people i felt had kidnapped us from our homeland , our culture , and our family			2
i was angry , hurt and grieving			0
after eight months , i was " re-homed , " without my sisters , to live with my adoptive mother 's parents in the @entity52			0
i have only seen my sisters a handful of times since			0
living in the @entity52 was difficult			0
i had been taken from my family in @entity5 , and then separated from my sisters			1
but instead of getting caught up in my depression , i threw myself into finding ways to let the world know the hard truths about corruption in international adoption			2
my second adoption placement did not work out either , and at 18 , while still in high school , i found myself staying on a friend 's floor			2
a family in @entity67 , who i met through adoption reform work , offered to take me in			1
so i moved my few possessions and myself across the country again			0
supporters of international adoption frequently mention the enormous numbers of orphans in the world -- @entity76 estimates there are 151 million orphans			2
what most people do n't realize is that when the @entity81 determines the figures for orphans , they include children who have lost just one parent ( the @entity81 estimates only 18 million have lost both parents )			2
i assure you that i did not consider myself an orphan			0
my sisters and i had a father , a brother and older sisters , plus a large extended family that cared for us and loved us			2
we were middle class by @entity5 standards , not poor			1
we , and many other adoptees like us , should never have been placed for adoption			2
all the lies and deception comes down to money			1
i have discovered since my adoption , the price paid by adoptive parents is exorbitant and feeds the corruption			2
had my father 's friends not made money from the placement of my sisters and me for adoption , none of this ever would have happened			1
they were basically paid to create orphans			0
depending upon the country , an adoption can cost upwards of $ 50,000			2
imagine what that kind of money could do to help struggling families in developing nations keep their children ! adding the horror of being sold for profit , i now know that parents pay far more to adopt a white child than an @entity130 - @entity11 child			1
a 2010 study by @entity132 , the @entity133 , and @entity134 showed that parents are willing to pay an average of $ 38,000 more for a non-african @entity11 baby			1
let me call that what it is : racism			0
in spite of everything i have suffered , i am determined to make something good out of my life			0
i just started college and i am writing a book about my experiences			0
i am fighting to change the way adoption agencies do business			0
i am fighting to make sure that families and adoptive families know the truth about the possibilities of fraud and human trafficking in adoption			0
i am fighting to make sure that no other child will have to endure what i have been through			0
and i am saving up money so that i can reunite with my family in @entity5 , whom i have n't seen for seven years			1
and i went to court and got my real name back .			0

@entity166 : when she was 13 , she went to the @entity11 thinking she would be studying *abroad*
inside a few weeks , it became clear her family had been *misled* about her @entity11 " adoption "
@entity166 : " all the lies and deception comes down to money "
now a college student , she has n't seen her family in @entity5 for seven years
