it 's not up there with @entity3			1
it does n't come to mind as quickly as the 70th anniversary of the end of @entity10 draws near			1
the day the @entity11 formally surrendered in ceremonies aboard the @entity13 in @entity14			1
many who will mark the various dates preceding that sunday are old enough to remember the actual events ; others will simply pay homage to those who did their part to bring about the @entity11 surrender			1
the date to mark here : january 30 , 1945			1
" a raid led by @entity27 to rescue @entity29 prisoners of war in the @entity32 prison camp in the @entity33 before the advance of gen. @entity36 's forces caused the @entity11 to move them to @entity11 or , more probably , kill them			1
after @entity36 's landing october 20 , 1944 , the @entity11 high command sent out instructions on the circumstances under which @entity42 could be killed to keep them from being liberated			1
at one camp they were burned alive			1
@entity10 magazine 's " @entity45 : massacre at @entity48 , " said , " @entity11 soldiers ... doused the wooden shelters with buckets of gasoline , and set them afire with flaming torches , followed by hand grenades			1
... as men engulfed in flames broke out of their fiery deathtraps , the @entity11 guards machine gunned , bayoneted and clubbed them to death			1
" only 11 of the 150 survived			1
the @entity62 , fearing for pows in other camps , decided to launch rescue efforts			1
the first was the raid on the @entity32 prison camp			1
a group of more than 100 @entity27 , @entity68 and @entity33 guerrillas traveled 30 miles behind @entity11 lines to reach the camp			1
along the route , other guerrillas in the villages muzzled dogs and put chickens in cages lest they alert the @entity11			1
the 30 - minute raid liberated 513 pows			1
some of them weighed so little the @entity27 could carry two men on their backs			1
at a rendezvous point , trucks and 26 carabao carts -- local wooden carts -- waited to carry them to safety			1
villagers along the way contributed more carts because the @entity29 had little or no clothing and shoes , and it became increasingly difficult for them to walk			1
by the time they reached @entity29 lines , 106 carts were being used			1
news of the rescue was released february 2 in the @entity33 ( because of the international date line ) , february 1 in the @entity29			2
i remember the day vividly			2
i was halfway around the world			2
an 18 - year - old copy girl at the @entity105			2
in my sixth week that thursday morning when i arrived for work			2
i was told not to go to my usual spot at the city desk			2
instead , @entity109 , the director of copy kids , led me to a square of four dark green metal desks like the others in the city room			2
the only items on the huge square surface : a stack of copy paper about an inch thick , a pair of scissors , a glue pot and a streamer of @entity125 wire - service copy with the names of the prisoners of war who had been rescued			2
in the interest of speed , no attempt was made to put the names in alphabetical order			2
that , as @entity109 explained , was where i came in			2
i was to alphabetize them			2
another copy kid would pick up the latest list for each edition			2
i 'd been there long enough to know the edition deadlines and set to work			2
when cut apart , the names were quarter - inch wide strips of paper			2
names and hometowns spelled out in the distinctive , typewriter - like letters of the @entity125 teletype machines			0
i laid them out , with space for new names , and as the 10:30 deadline approached , i reached for a sheet of copy paper , applied a wide strip of glue down the center and started sticking the strips down			0
as i worked , reporters nearby were leafing through their telephone directories in search of local families , to let them know their son or brother or husband was among the rescued			0
i noticed city editor @entity165 , during a break , stroll over to the reporters ' desks			0
the reporter nearest me , beckoned him with a nod and , placing his hand over the telephone mouthpiece , said , " his mother wants to know how he is			0
is he ok ? all right ? " the slow , solemn shake of @entity165 's head told me ... and the reporter , who removed his hand from the telephone mouthpiece and said , " we do n't have much information on that yet , @entity183			1
but he 's been rescued			1
he 's one of those who were brought out , brought back to @entity187 lines			1
he 's in good hands , now			1
" a final , upbeat note			0
" and i 'm sure you 'll be hearing from him soon			0
" it was a little thing , and you can say it was basic kindness			0
but i remember it , along with the narrow strips of paper on the runway - like strip of glue			0
and how , because i did n't trim the streamers of @entity125 copy , the paper ends curled up on either side of the names			0
the slow , solemn shake of @entity165 's head told me it was bad			1
an @entity125 story told me how bad			0
" sixth @entity210 , @entity211 -- ( @entity125 ) -- there is a long , dusty , twisting land near here which should become a war monument , for today it bridged two worlds			0
it leads across the plain toward the death camp where 513 prisoners of war were rescued by @entity29 @entity27 and @entity33 guerrillas			0
" ... there were also those who limped from beri - beri , legs scored by tropical ulcers and other diseases , and of course , there were those who looked up helplessly from litters			0
they tried proudly to be soldiers , carrying themselves as erect as possible			0
" many saluted , promptly and stayed at attention when talking to officers			0
one man who did this crept into a truck and sank back exhausted a minute later			0
that was when the world began to learn about the horrors of the @entity246 -- when the men who had surrendered at @entity248 were force marched to pow camps			0
to begin to comprehend , consider this account from @entity254 ' @entity253 series " @entity257 " -- taken from the companion book by @entity256 and @entity254 : " here and there along the road , water gushed from artesian wells			0
some guards allowed men to pause long enough for a swallow or two			0
others shot or clubbed or bayoneted those who tried			0
for @entity271 , as for most of those who somehow survived , the sights and stench and random cruelty all merged in memory , until it was hard to tell one day 's horrors from the next			1
" ' i saw men buried alive			0
when a guy was bayoneted or shot , laying in the road , and the convoys were coming along , i saw trucks that would just go out of their way to run over the guy in the @entity284			0
and likewise the rest of the trucks , and by the time you have fifteen or twenty trucks run over you , you look like a mashed tomato			0
... i saw @entity33 and @entity29 beheaded just with one swipe of a saber			0
' " hissing vultures too engorged to fly battled over the blackening corpses sprawled along both sides of the road			0
... one officer thought it his duty to keep track of the number of cut - off heads he passed			0
he stopped counting at twenty - seven , afraid that further tallying would drive him mad			0
" that is what the 513 rescued men had endured ... and three years in a pow camp			1
the names on the narrow strips of @entity125 copy , the two ends curling up			0
no wonder -- 70 years ago or not -- i remember " @entity25			1
" and think everyone should			0
january 30 , 1945 .			1

it 's been 70 years since a daring raid freed more than 500 pows in @entity10
@entity321 : january 30 should be remembered for this moment in history
