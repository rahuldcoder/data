-- @entity1 was lean and athletic ; he skied and walked a lot , and would go snowshoeing every wednesday with his friends			0
a golf course superintendent , he lived in @entity6 , @entity7 , with his wife and three sons			0
one evening in 2000 , he and his buddies decided to snowshoe up @entity11 and ride the gondola down			0
@entity1 complained of indigestion on the way up , which was odd because his last meal had been lunch			0
he told his friends he needed to sit down before getting on the gondola			0
after the group got in the cable car , he lost consciousness			0
@entity1 was not a smoker and only drank a glass of wine every now and then			0
his blood pressure was always fine			1
his physician had told him that his cholesterol was fine , too , but that he might need to watch it , his wife , @entity26 , remembers			0
but despite appearing healthy , @entity1 died of a heart attack at age 47			1
" we did not see that coming at all , " @entity26 said			0
" that was a tough one -- just when @entity35 was starting to become a good male role model for ( their sons )			1
" heart attacks may seem like a senior citizen phenomenon , considering that about 82 % of people who die of coronary heart disease are at least 65 , according to the @entity43			2
but sudden heart problems can occur much earlier in life , too			1
" @entity47 " actor @entity46 , 51 , died in @entity48 wednesday of an apparent heart attack			1
actor @entity50 died in september at age 54 , having never recovered from the heart attack he suffered on july 13			1
@entity53 , son of actor @entity54 , died of atherosclerosis , a condition that brought on a heart attack , according to the @entity59 coroner			1
heart attack risk goes up in men older than 45 and women older than 55 , but it can happen even earlier			1
while lifestyle modifications help reduce risk -- eating a healthy diet , maintaining good blood pressure and normal weight , not smoking -- sometimes it 's not enough			1
family history is a big risk factor that ca n't be changed			2
@entity1 's father had a triple bypass surgery more than a year before @entity1 's death , @entity26 said			0
and men are more likely to have heart attacks than women			1
what causes a heart attack ? a heart attack happens when the blood that flows to a section of heart muscle gets blocked			1
that section of heart muscle begins to die without a quick restoration of blood flow , according to the @entity86			1
heart attacks are often the result of coronary artery disease , which occurs when a waxy substance called plaque builds up in the coronary artery			2
an autopsy revealed that @entity1 had severe blockage , @entity26 said			0
the location in the artery involved plays a role , said @entity98 , a cardiologist in @entity99			0
if there 's a huge clot producing such extensive damage that the heart stops beating , it could only take a matter of minutes to be fatal			2
heart attacks in the @entity108 are uncommon among people younger than 55 , but the numbers could rise because obesity is a growing problem , said dr. @entity113 , @entity114 professor and dean of the faculties of health sciences and medicine at @entity119			1
being overweight leads to type ii diabetes and increases in blood pressure and bad cholesterol			1
heavy smoking is also a strong risk factor for heart attacks			1
refraining from smoking and not becoming obese are key for avoiding heart attacks , he said			2
if you are obese , make sure your cholesterol and blood pressure are under control			1
" there 's no better prevention than addressing the reversible risk factors , " @entity113 said			2
when a person who 's especially young dies of heart problems , such as in their thirties or younger , something other than blockage to the heart may be at work , @entity98 said			2
the heart could be enlarged or thickened , or there may be a congenital abnormality that would predispose the person to die suddenly			2
because younger people do n't believe they 're at risk of heart attacks , they might not get themselves to a hospital right away when experiencing warning signs			1
who will get a heart attack is still somewhat mysterious there 's still a long way to go in terms of determining who is most at risk of a heart attack , he said			1
" more often than not , the first symptom of heart disease could be heart attack , " @entity98 said			1
" that is a huge gap in the profession that we 're still dealing with			0
" red wine , minus the alcohol , may lower blood pressure a recent study showed that a test called a coronary calcium scan can be effective in predicting cardiovascular risk			1
this scan identifies specks of calcium in the arterial walls , which are an early sign of plaque buildup			0
it 's relatively cheap -- about $ 200 -- but does involve some radiation exposure			0
@entity98 recommends it for women as young as 50 , and for men 45 and older			1
but if you have a strong family history of premature heart disease , it may be best to start even earlier in the forties			1
one of @entity98 's patients , @entity190 , had his first heart attack at age 43			1
he drove himself to the hospital in 2008 when he started having pain in his chest , back , arm and jaw			0
he did n't know he had heart problems , but his grandparents and two uncles on his mother 's side had cardiovascular disease			2
the event was scary , but @entity190 did n't follow his doctor 's recommendations			0
his second heart attack was a month later			1
" the second time , he was noncompliant with diet and his regimen of smoking , " @entity98 said			0
" i was n't surprised			0
when he was very compliant , he does great			0
" in the past four years , @entity190 has had three stents and four balloon angioplasties			0
stents can improve blood flow and treat narrow or weak arteries			2
a balloon angioplasty is a ballooning of the vessel to open it			0
" i 've seen the results of me not taking care of myself , " @entity190 said			0
a more heart - healthy lifestyle these days , @entity190 is on a low - cholesterol , low - fat diet			2
he exercises six times a week , with at least 40 minutes of cardio and 20 to 30 minutes of weight lifting			2
practicing these behaviors " keeps you out of the hospital and keeps you out of trouble , " he said			0
@entity26 , whose husband died after snowshoeing in 2008 , watches out for trans fats and has warned her three sons about heart risks			1
they are in good shape , she said , and none of them smoke			2
" they know , with @entity35 having a heart event that early , " she said			0
" i hope i 've impressed them -- or just general health knowledge has impressed them -- with the importance of taking care of yourself			0

heart attack risk goes up in men over 45 and women over 55
it can happen even earlier : @entity53 died at age 36
maintaining good blood pressure and normal weight can help reduce risk
