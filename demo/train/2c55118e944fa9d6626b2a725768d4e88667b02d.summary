" schools will be in session but , ultimately it is your decision as parents whether to send your children to school			0
@entity29 will respect your decision and all absences will be excused and will not impact a student 's perfect attendance			0
" for the moment , the reopening of schools and roads tuesday provided a sense of relief to a community under virtual lock - down since @entity5 -- a 31 - year - old self - styled survivalist and war buff -- allegedly killed a state police officer and shot another officer september 12 during an ambush outside the @entity47 barracks in @entity48 , @entity4			1

on tuesday , two days after authorities discovered an @entity75 rifle , some magazines and a small bag of ammo in the northeastern @entity4 woods where they believe @entity5 is hiding , the search moved slightly north , police said			1
" he 's out in those woods right now , " @entity4 gov. @entity81 told reporters a day earlier			1
state police lt. col @entity84 , who joined the governor , said , " i do believe that we are close to him at this point			1
" tracking dogs had indicated " we 're on the right trail , " @entity84 said a day earlier , adding that thermal imaging technology was being used to find @entity5 , who authorities believe had been planning the ambush for months or possibly years			2
investigators said the items they found were either abandoned or hidden by @entity5 , who is a skilled marksman and trained survivalist			1
@entity97 planned for months ? authorities have said that @entity5 hated law enforcement and that they believe that he 's solely focused on hurting more officers , but not civilians			2
when asked why investigators concluded that , @entity81 answered that the night of the barracks shooting , @entity5 had the opportunity to shoot civilians and did n't take it			1
