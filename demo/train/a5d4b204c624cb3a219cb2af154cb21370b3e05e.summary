@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity3 have an authenticity problem			1
after many decades of enjoying huge political power , elected officials are struggling to energize voters about the party 's brand name			0
even the troubles faced by president @entity11 do n't seem to help			0
the recent interest in governors such as @entity1 's @entity14 or national politicians who are relatively new to @entity16 , such as sen. @entity17 or sen. @entity18 , reflects a thirst in the electorate to find @entity3 who will stand for something and mean what they say			1
according to the @entity25 , the @entity24 brothers are pouring money into rebuilding the party around candidates who stand for their libertarian ideals			0
the challenge that @entity3 face is captured in a new pilot airing on @entity32 , " @entity36 , " written by @entity34 creator @entity33 and starring @entity35			1
the comedy focuses on the life of a group of four @entity3 senators who room together on @entity42 in what the producers call a " man cave			1
" the pilot shows republicans in @entity16 who are essentially faking it , putting on theater for constituents despite what they really believe			0
the show begins with one of the senators , played by @entity54 , oversleeping on the morning he was supposed to turn himself in to the @entity56 for some kind of unspecified wrongdoing			1
one of the senators , a closeted homosexual , tries to bolster his heterosexual credentials by castigating gay marriage in front of a conservative group and trying to learn to shoot a gun for a possible photo op. @entity35 plays a @entity68 senator who is grudgingly forced to campaign in his state even though he has little interest in dealing with voters			1
the parody , with an admittedly liberal slant , conveys the essential dilemma that the party faces : the growing skepticism about a number of arguments that the @entity3 continues to make about itself			1
the party of fiscal restraint : @entity3 claim to be the party of fiscal responsibility , the people who will balance the budget and constrain the budget in contrast to the reckless @entity87			1
yet the @entity3 now has a long history of running up the deficit			1
when @entity3 are presidents , spending has continued to rise and deficits have gone up			2
the presidency of @entity93 burst any illusion that @entity3 would maintain a tight fiscal order			1
@entity93 inherited surpluses from president @entity97 but as a result of the tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 , combined with military and domestic spending , he turned them into a deficit			0
even with all the rhetoric coming out of @entity103 today about republicans who desire to control spending , a close look at the plans of individuals such as congressman @entity109 shows that deficits would remain alive and well if their policies went into effect			0
the party of outsiders : this has been a favorite trope for the @entity3 , with republicans still acting as if they live in an era dominated by the @entity87			1
but nothing can be further from the truth			0
@entity3 have enjoyed a strong run in the @entity122 since @entity124 's victory in 1968 and they have maintained control of @entity103 for much of the period since 1994			2
during this time , @entity3 have formed close connections with the @entity129 lobbying community and become accustomed to the benefits of pork barrel spending			2
@entity35 's character reflects an image that too many , on the right and left , have of @entity3 elected officials			2
belying the notion that they are not part of life inside the @entity139 , @entity3 have also been implicated in many scandals involving the abuse of power , such as all the politicians who fell as a result of their connection to the lobbyist @entity145 in 2006 , making it difficult for many @entity146 to hear @entity3 blast away at the very @entity16 in which its members thrive			2
the party of morality : this remains a chestnut for many republicans who want to appeal to notions of social and cultural conservatism			2
although this position has come under fire as out of touch with where many @entity146 are on issues such as gender rights and gay rights , the party 's leaders are generally standing firm			0
yet scandals in recent decades have rocked the image of the party			0
in @entity68 , former gov. @entity171 's congressional campaign has stumbled as voters were reminded of the affair that brought him down from power			0
the party of national security : this was one of the most important claims for the party since @entity181 the @entity3 had made significant political gains , arguing that they were better equipped to handle national security than the @entity87			1
they used this argument to devastate their opponents			0
but the memory of the war in @entity188 under president @entity93 continues to haunt the party			0
the recent opening of @entity93 's presidential library brought up memories of the controversy , as does the current debate over whether to send arms to @entity197 rebels following evidence that the government used weapons of mass destruction			0
the deployment of military resources based on faulty intelligence and the enormous failures of the post-reconstruction period in @entity188 have put @entity3 on the defensive			2
the party of opportunity : @entity3 have always argued that their policies would offer the greatest opportunities to the largest number of @entity146			1
through trickle down economics and the expansion of markets , @entity3 said , all @entity146 would gradually prosper			2
yet many of the party 's economic policies have proved to benefit a small portion of the population , bolstering critics who claim that the @entity3 does not support the middle class			1
when 2012 @entity3 presidential nominee @entity223 was secretly taped talking about 47 % of the nation consisting of people who did n't pay taxes , he perpetuated this image , which was damaging to his campaign			1
for many voters , the rhetoric of the @entity3 does not reflect the recent history of the party			1
until @entity3 put forth more compelling ideas and offering politicians who stand for something , they will have trouble regaining strength			0
until they do , shows such as " @entity36 " will continue to ring true			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity243 .			0

a pilot show , " @entity36 , " depicts @entity3 senators in *unflattering* light
@entity243 says show makes @entity3 out to be *hypocrites*
he says the party is *perceived* to lack authenticity in pushing conservative values
@entity243 : @entity3 has n't shown it is party of fiscal restraint , national security , morality
