-- competitors and judges describe entries for their contest as wild , crazy , baffling and just plain cool			1
some of the ideas are " way impossible , " but that 's sort of the point , they say , when a bunch of bright , young and talented designers and architects imagine a moon colony in 2069			1
the design competition , created by the nonprofit urban planning group @entity14 , produced wildly creative illustrations and concepts that touch on subjects as diverse as moon - based athletic games and a lunar cemetery			1
as entertaining as some of the designs were , they proposed solutions to serious issues such as world hunger and shrinking energy resources			2
" the most important thing was bringing together two completely different industries , " said @entity27 , @entity14 's founding executive director			0
" architecture is changing as our society and technology changes			2
this shows how architecture could become a part of the astronautics industry			2
" of course humans have been imagining space colonies in drawings and models for more than half a century , as @entity43 reminded readers last month			0
@entity47 's @entity46 competition aimed to smash together two fields that often find themselves at odds : architecture and engineering			1
" the tension between what is mostly ideal or perhaps impossible and what is logical and clearly achievable is necessary to arrive at passionate and creative solutions , " said contest judge @entity53 , a professor of space systems design at @entity55			1
the entries " are mostly exercises in vision and architecture and wholly meant to inform engineers where humanity 's priorities lie with respect to human space activity on the moon			0
" the winning entry by designer @entity71 imagines a moon base surrounding a massive satellite dish that would collect solar energy and beam it back to @entity75			0
another concept puts a moon colony in a hole in the ground called a lava tube			0
how about this : a giant sports stadium that would serve as the venue for the first site - neutral international athletic games			1
new sporting events would be introduced that make use of the moon 's low gravity , say its designers -- two architecture students at @entity92 , @entity92			1
" we researched a lot of energy producing and capturing technologies that we could incorporate into the project , " said @entity93 , 23			0
@entity93 's collaborator , 22 - year - old @entity98 said the colony would include " places for algae farms and other plant life to grow -- for food and to produce oxygen			1
" space is a perfect place to creatively imagine the impossible , @entity53 said			0
" there is something in the @entity111 psyche that caters to the stuff of ' @entity114 ' and ' @entity113 ' and ' @entity115 , ' do n't you think ? " @entity93 and @entity98 acknowledged the influence of science fiction seeping into the project			0
" the illustration of the elevator core -- looking up -- i kept coming back to ' @entity122 ' for that one , " said @entity98			1
" now the new ' @entity122 ' movie is coming out in december and we 're excited about that			2
" one of the contest designs prompted urban planning blogger @entity128 to mention another @entity130 sci - fi flick			2
" the visual , to me , evokes ' @entity133 's ' human farms ... seeing how warm and fuzzy i am for the moon , not quite my vision : ) " is it possible @entity98 or @entity93 or another of the competition 's designers will someday contribute to an actual design project built on the lunar surface ? " it 's totally possible , " said @entity27			1
" we just have to be willing to spend the money on it			0
let 's just say it 's probably going to happen , we just do n't know when			0

architects , designers show their ideas for lunar colony in 2069
@entity152 , crazy , impossible designs include international sports stadium , giant solar collector
contest was exercise to *combine* architecture with engineering
illustration for one design was inspired by 1982 film " @entity122 "
