president @entity96 's regime has touted the constitutional referendum as a move toward reform			1

but analysts and protesters widely describe the effort as a farce , a superficial attempt to pacify @entity96 's critics			0

@entity0 and other media outlets can not independently verify opposition or government reports because @entity2 has severely limited access to the country by foreign journalists			1

... it 's a difficult issue			0
