the last few years have n't been kind to the private jet industry			1
a still - not - recovered global economy has meant a continued lull in the sales department , and many execs are wary of incurring the wrath of shareholders should they get caught cruising on a corporate jet			1
the market is starting to find its footing , however , thanks in part to the innovations of a few savvy companies , who are working together to make private aviation faster , cheaper and more accessible			1
according to @entity16 , a market intelligence provider for the aviation industry , the private jet industry ( including fractional and whole ownership ) was practically stagnant in the @entity19 last year , and declined by nearly 4 percent in @entity20			1
by comparison , the charter business is soaring			1
@entity23 , the founder of @entity24 , an online booking service that has done for the private jet industry what @entity26 and @entity27 did for commercial flights , has seen a yearly threefold growth since he launched his company in 2007			1
while third - party booking sites have become standard in the field of commercial aviation , in the private jet industry , @entity24 is an innovator			1
" when i really started looking around online , i could n't believe there was n't a way to book a private jet , " says @entity23			1
he recognized a gap in the market , and his wife and partner , @entity43 , sold her house to help him start a new company that would fill the gap			1
though @entity23 jokes that his " mother - in - law still is n't completely convinced it was a wise decision , " @entity24 has since become @entity20 's fastest growing aviation company			0
the advantage to customers , he notes , is that they can compare prices of over 2,500 aircraft , either through the website or on the @entity24 mobile app. they can also book a jet at practically a moment 's notice			1
" our record to get somebody airborne from having their request submitted is 40 minutes , " he notes			0

" essentially , it 's a matchmaking exercise , " says @entity23			0
making the connection between supply and demand less obscure has also helped bring down the price of private jets			1
for example , if an operator has an " empty leg , " that is , they 've flown someone one way and face a potentially empty cabin on the return flight , they can offer a discount for that leg of the journey			2
in this way , private flight has become more affordable , and more accessible , than ever before			2
@entity24 is n't the only company to take advantage of the empty leg			2
@entity19 charter company @entity96 posts several empty leg sales daily ( they dub these " @entity98 " ) via @entity99 and @entity100			1
these range from $ 499 to $ 1,499 for one leg of a journey on either a @entity104 ( which seats up to four ) or a @entity105 ( which can seat six )			0
that price is not per person ; it 's per aircraft			0
" some of those trips are silly , like @entity111 to @entity112			0
but sometimes you can get an entire plane for $ 499 that flies from @entity117 to @entity118 , and you can split the price between four people , " says @entity96 ceo @entity113			0
granted , he notes , " that 's a rarity			0
" @entity96 's clients have to buy into a membership ( and these start at $ 50,000 ) , but they get considerably more bang for their buck			2
the number of flight hours they use is subtracted from the total , and @entity96 says they charge half of what their competition might charge , around $ 3,000			0
" a lot of our competitors are still caught up in the 1980s , when private jets were all about champagne and caviar			1
we do n't serve food on board ; we 're just a time machine , " says @entity113 , who was also a founding partner of @entity140			0

customers , for instance , can choose to land in airports with lower taxi landing fees -- a savings that is reflected in their total bill			1
it also opts for lighter , less expensive planes			2
" we have an efficiency model , " says @entity113			0
" not only does the @entity161 cost less , but it burns less gas			0
we 're saving a ton of money on fuel and capital costs , and we pass those savings on			0
" though their model may come across as rather austere for a luxury product , @entity113 notes it 's more practical in the current climate			0
" there 's a stigma attached to a corporation having their own airplanes right now , " he notes			0
" so a lot of companies are looking for alternative solutions			2
for guys who are afraid to use airplanes because their shareholders wo n't like it , they use us			0
" @entity184 , a private jet service that launched last october , is hoping to bring the price of bookings down even further , so they 're on par with first - and business - class commercial flights			1
the company is still in the process of gathering members and plans to launch its first flights in may			2
like @entity96 , @entity196 is a membership program , with plans starting at $ 2,350 per month ( these include 10 @entity19 domestic round trip flights of up to 3.5 hours )			1
unlike @entity200 , @entity196 does n't own any planes			2
rather , they purchase charters and allow members to divide the cost			0
" we 're not one jet , one customer , which is a tradition for the industry , " notes @entity205 , @entity196 's ceo			2
instead , @entity196 will try and pair members who are heading to the same place at the same time on a single flight			0

" most people give up three to five hours a day flying commercial , and when you fly private you get this time back , " says @entity205 , referring to the hours saved avoiding security lines , bag checks and customs			2
" keeping that in mind , when you break down a coast - to - coast trip , it is $ 6,600 to fly @entity196 , versus $ 6,000 to fly first class with an airline			0
