-- many computer engineers consider a job offer from @entity3 as the golden ticket			1
outdoor volleyball courts , free gourmet food , on - site haircuts , massages and laundry are among the perks @entity3 has offered its employees at its main campus in @entity13 , @entity14			1
but some of the people who do leave are challenging the company in the best way an engineer knows how : by developing programs that could detract from @entity3 's core business			1
@entity22 worked at @entity3 for seven years , managing teams of engineers on a variety of products such as the @entity28 browser and the moribund @entity29			1
near the end of his stint at @entity3 , @entity22 developed a browser extension for @entity28 called @entity33			1
the software blocks websites that have @entity33 widgets installed from automatically sending information about the user back to the social networking company			0
@entity33 has 75,000 users , @entity22 said			0
" no one at @entity3 asked me to do it , " @entity22 told @entity0 this week			1
what sparked @entity22 's project , he said , was reading the recent scrutiny of online data - collection tactics chronicled by news organizations			0
the @entity47 has been running a series called " what they know , " and @entity0 had its own last week called " end of @entity51			0
" while @entity33 and the applications that run on its platform can be considered personal - data hoarders , @entity22 eventually realized his then - employer was , itself , among the biggest collectors			0
to name a few practices , @entity3 can track search queries over time , target ads to its @entity60 users based on the contents of e-mails , and use a person 's location data to determine which shops ' ads it will show			1
@entity3 , like many web advertising companies , uses small files called cookies to track internet surfing habits in order to better target ads. " i never worked directly with user data , " @entity22 said of his time at @entity3			1
" i did n't have a good sense of what was being collected			2
privacy was n't a passion of mine or something that i knew a lot about until basically two months ago , when i started reading about this stuff			2
" @entity22 left @entity3 in november to focus more on programs that empower people to take control of their privacy online			1
" i had this holy - cow moment when i realized what was going on , " @entity22 said			0
" there 's just so much unknown about what 's being done with this data			0
" " i think there is a good reason to be concerned with it all and , frankly , to be fearful of it , " he said			0
last week , he released a second browser extension , another tool for @entity28 , called @entity33			0
once installed , the program blocks major internet companies , including @entity3 , from installing cookies on -- and thus tracking -- a computer			1
people using @entity104 can decide which cookies they 'd like to allow onto their system			0
cookies can be helpful when , for example , you 'd like a website to remember your login credentials and not ask for them every time you visit			0
" i would like to see us move to a point where all the data that 's collected about folks is intentional , " rather than without people 's knowledge , @entity22 said			0
" so if i give you permission to collect my data , then go ahead and do it			0
" in its first week , 25,000 people downloaded disconnect			0
@entity22 is releasing a new version friday that lets users choose whether @entity3 can personalize search queries based on the data it has about the person			1
by default , @entity33 blocks @entity3 from doing this			1
" any data that 's collected has the potential to escape the collector , " @entity22 said			0
" so i would like to see @entity3 only collect data that i explicitly allow them to collect			1
" @entity3 hosts a dashboard for users to review a breakdown of the messages and information attached to their accounts			1
the @entity142 provides information on how the company collects data and lets people , whether they 're registered with @entity3 or not , opt out of ad and analytics tracking			2
@entity149 , another @entity151 engineer , developed an alternative to complicated opt - out systems that vary between ad networks			0
like @entity33 , it 's a browser extension , and there are versions for @entity28 and @entity159 's @entity158			0
called @entity149 , @entity161 's program can prevent web pages from loading and displaying ads. that includes @entity3 's ads , which account for the vast majority of the search giant 's revenue			1
@entity149 offers a setting to easily enable ads from @entity161 's former employer , though those ads are disabled by default			2
" @entity3 did n't ask me to put that in , " @entity161 wrote in an e-mail			1
" i find @entity3 text ads to be useful			1
" still , @entity161 says he blocks most ads because " i do n't wish to be bombarded by consumerism			2
" the real economic conundrum : if website visitors do n't pay figuratively -- by watching ads or by having their personal information sent to advertisers -- they may have to start paying real money for online services			2
@entity22 plans to devote six months to developing @entity104 and will reevaluate then whether it could be a sustainable business			0
he 's " pretty close " to releasing an extension for @entity158 and recently began working on one for @entity188 , he said			0
if he 's forced to abandon the project , the source code is freely available to any enterprising developers who want to take up the cause			0
" the only business model i see , " @entity22 said , is to eventually provide a more advanced version of the software that costs money			0
" when i use something like @entity3 , i 'm paying for @entity3 with my attention and my data , " he said			2
" there 's no such thing as free			0
these are companies that have to pay employees ' salaries			2
" parts of @entity3 's maturing business may clash with some of the wide - eyed engineers it hopes to attract , especially those passionate about taking risks to change the world , hopefully for the better			1
but a @entity3 spokesman , who declined to comment on most questions pertaining to this story , said the company 's attrition rate -- that is , the percentage of employees that defect -- has n't changed in more than seven years and is better than the industry standard			1
in addition to all the on - campus amenities , a program called " 20 % @entity221 " lets @entity3 engineers devote a sizable chunk of their work weeks to projects of their choosing			1
( @entity22 said he developed @entity33 after work hours			0
) the perks have n't stopped some high - profile people from leaving the company			2
product designer @entity233 left in a huff last year for a job at @entity236 after reportedly becoming fed up with nearly three years of what he publicly described as @entity3 's design - by - committee mentality			1
some notable @entity3 alumni are spiting their former employer in a different way -- by joining @entity33			1
the social network is perceived by some as @entity3 's biggest rival			1
people are spending more of their time online using @entity33			0
they 're thumbing through photos and asking questions to friends , rather than searching the wider web			0
@entity3 is unable to crawl most of the data posted to @entity33			2
as @entity3 - to - @entity33 defections grow , @entity3 is reportedly offering some employees multimillion - dollar packages to convince them not to go to @entity33			1
after wooing executives who worked on @entity3 - owned @entity256 , @entity257 and advertising ; the architect of @entity260 ; and at least two @entity60 co-founders , this week , @entity33 claimed @entity262 , a former @entity3 employee who was previously an outspoken critic of the social network			2
@entity264 , @entity33 's venerable chief operating officer , also came from the big @entity265 but abandoning @entity3 has n't always proved to be a wise or permanent move			1
@entity267 left the company in 2007 to start a rival search engine called @entity270			0
when that tanked , she returned to @entity3 in september .			2

some @entity3 employees are leaving to create or join rival businesses
notable defections include engineers *building* programs that spike @entity3 ads
@entity3 says its attrition rate has n't changed in seven years
