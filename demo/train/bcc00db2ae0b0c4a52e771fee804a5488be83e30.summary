-- the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 @entity2 has taken a new twist as football 's world governing body @entity7 lodged a criminal complaint with the @entity10 judiciary tuesday			1
the complaint relates to the " international transfers of assets with connections to @entity10 , which merit examination by the criminal prosecution authorities			1
" the @entity7 statement added : " the subject of the criminal complaint is the possible misconduct of individual persons in connection with the awarding of the hosting rights of the 2018 and @entity24			1
" @entity7 lodged the complaint with the attorney general of @entity10 in @entity27 on the recommendation of @entity30 judge @entity29 -- @entity7 's independent ethics adjudicator			1
" i lodged the criminal complaint upon the recommendation of @entity35 , " @entity7 president @entity32 said			1
" i can not , however , comment on any possible criminal offenses			2
i am not a lawyer			0
" i also was not the addressee of the investigatory report , which i have never seen			0
however , given judge @entity29 's recommendation , it was my duty -- as the president of @entity7 -- to lodge the complaint			1
" @entity29 's recommendation was based on the evidence compiled by @entity47 -- chairman of the investigatory chamber of the @entity50 -- who has been examining the awarding of the hosting rights of the 2018 and 2022 @entity2			2
however @entity32 insisted there was no change to @entity29 's statement " that the investigation into the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 @entity2 is concluded			1
" @entity29 , who is set to meet with @entity47 on thursday to discuss the report , says he came across " indications that pointed to suspected unlawful activity in connection with @entity10			2
" he told @entity7 's website : " in the circumstances , i saw it as my duty to bring this to the @entity7 president 's attention and to recommend to him that the @entity10 criminal prosecution authorities be informed			1
" @entity29 has been heavily criticized since publishing his 42 - page summary into @entity47 's 18 - month investigation last friday			2
the @entity30 told reporters last week that he had been surprised by the strength of bad feeling surrounding his summary			0
" i would like to point out that not once did my statement involve a so - called " whitewashing " of the award process with regard to the various allegations and assumptions made , contrary to what has been claimed in some quarters , " he said			0
" my statement was based on the @entity47 report -- i can only work with the material contained in it , and in my view , there was insufficient clear evidence of illegal or irregular conduct that would call into question the integrity of the award process as a whole			0
" however , in certain places , the report does indicate that further clarification is needed of certain circumstances			0
much of this clarification work can be carried out by the @entity50 itself , while the remainder is the responsibility of the relevant national investigatory authorities			0
" with @entity47 and @entity29 set to discuss their differences over the summary on thursday , @entity105 , who specializes in sports law for @entity107 , raised questions over the timing of the announcement			0
" it 's interesting that @entity47 said his report had been misrepresented , yet @entity29 decides to take evidence to the @entity10 judiciary now , " he told @entity0			1
" why lodge the criminal complaint given they are meeting later this week ? " @entity105 also believes that @entity47 , who has appealed to @entity7 's appeal committee over the findings in @entity29 's summary , could take his complaints further			1
" @entity47 has referred the matter to the appeals committee , but if his complaint is rejected he could then go to the @entity124 , which is extremely thorough and can look at all the evidence			2
" @entity124 ' decision and reasoning would be made public			0
names would have to be redacted but it would be a way for the bulk of his report -- the sections he believes to be most important coming into the public domain			0
