-- they are the parents who canceled @entity2			0
@entity3 and @entity4 of @entity5 , @entity6 , had finally had enough of their little hurricanes			1
for months , the couple had been trying to teach their three boys , ages 11 , 8 and 5 , to stop being disrespectful and acting entitled			1
" we gave them good warning , either it was time for their behavior to change or there would be consequences , " wrote @entity4 , co-founder of the @entity14 blog , in a recent post			1
" we patiently worked with them for several months and guess what , very little changed			1
one day after a particularly bad display of entitlement @entity3 said , ' we should just cancel @entity2			1
' " and that 's what they did			0
@entity31 is n't coming to the @entity33 house this year			1
the family is taking the money that would have been spent on gifts and using it for service projects and helping other people			1
it 's not like her children suffer from a lack of toys , @entity4 wrote			1
the family will still decorate and celebrate @entity2 as the birth of @entity46 , and the children will still get presents from other family			2
though they 're taking some heat from critics who call them @entity56 , the gifts these parents are giving their children are so much more important than the latest popular " @entity60 " figure or electronic gadget soon relegated to the dustbin			1
these gifts will last a lifetime			2
the gift of consequences how many times do parents threaten to take away the television / ipad / favorite toys unless their children start to behave ? if the threats continue but there 's never any follow - through , children come to believe that there are n't any consequences			1
they also learn that their parents ca n't be trusted to tell the truth			0
and they develop a nasty habit of manipulating to get what they want			0
the @entity33 children will probably never doubt their parents ' word again			2
the gift of perspective @entity33 knew that her children had plenty to be grateful for , including good food , a nice home and too many toys to count			1
what they needed was a dose of perspective , which they got			2
they used the @entity31 money to start a clothing drive for victims of @entity99 in the @entity100 and ship the goods overseas			2
they are also considering participating in an @entity104 program			0
the gift of imagination the boys are n't sitting around feeling sorry for themselves			2
besides organizing as a family to do good works for others , the boys have responded by making gifts for each other and sneaking them into each child 's stocking			0
" they are learning exactly what we wanted them to learn , because they are not moping around feeling sorry for themselves , " she wrote			0
" they are thinking of others			0
" the gift of family @entity2 has n't been completely canceled in the @entity33 household			0
what 's been canceled is an overwhelmingly commercial @entity2			0
instead of a race to the tree to see what @entity31 brought , the focus on christmas morning will be on spending time together with @entity4 's cinnamon rolls , their faith , family games and the opportunity to " truly enjoy the few presents they did get " from grandparents and others			1
" while this may not be the best choice for everyone , it feels right for our family right now , " she wrote			0
" our kids get to focus on that feeling			0
i am almost certain this will be the best @entity2 they ever have ! "			0

months of disrespectful behavior led @entity3 and @entity4 to a *drastic* *decision*
their children are using gift money to help others and get perspective
the @entity158 hope their children will get many *intangible* gifts this year
