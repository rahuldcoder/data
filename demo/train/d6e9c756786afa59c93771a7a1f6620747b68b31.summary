@entity0 -- hoops games happen all the time on aircraft carriers , but tuesday officials from the @entity7 , the @entity4 and @entity5 met to discuss staging a major college basketball game on the aircraft carrier @entity10			1
the @entity10 has played key roles in the fight against terrorism almost since day one			0
the ship launched the first wave of air attacks on @entity18 and @entity19 targets in @entity20 after september 11 , 2001 , and most recently it was the ship from which @entity21 was buried at sea			0
now the @entity10 is on track to make sports history , as the first ever carrier to host an @entity4 basketball game			1
the final deal has n't been reached , but the plan , being promoted by @entity5 , calls for the @entity29 to play the @entity30 on @entity31 , november 11 , on the top deck of the @entity10 at the @entity34 naval base in @entity35 at about 4 p.m. pt. " the discussion with representatives is still ongoing			0
if we are able to come to a final agreement , we look forward to the opportunity this event presents for our @entity7 and the veterans , " @entity43			1
@entity44 , @entity7 spokesman , said			1
" we 're still reviewing the proposal			0
" the " @entity52 , " as the game has been dubbed , would be the first televised college basketball game of the season for @entity48 , which agreed to air the game if the negotiations are finalized and the @entity7 signs off on the deal			1
but it will take more than a deal to pull the game off			2
first there 's the game itself			2
unlike indoor arenas , the deck of an aircraft carrier would mean possible winds , rain or sunshine			2
to cope with possible weather problems , two courts would be built on the ship : one up on the flight deck , the other below in the hangar deck , which would be protected from rain and some wind			1
the seating for the flight deck stadium would be wrapped with fabric to help block the wind , which college basketball players typically do n't have to cope with			0
as for the sunshine , the ship would be moored alongside a pier that would put the sun about midcourt , so no players would have to shoot into the setting sun. plus a professional lighting crew that does lighting for rock concerts has been contacted about bringing in lights to help keep the court lit enough for the players and the tv cameras			0
an aircraft carrier is the @entity7 's most important asset			1
the game would attract about 7,000 fans			2
getting them onto a secure @entity7 base and then on board a nuclear - powered aircraft carrier would take a significant security effort			1
part of that has been addressed by the promoters , who do n't plan to sell tickets to the public			0
instead , some tickets will go to @entity108 and @entity109 and a few to sponsors as well as some youth coaches who take part in an onshore clinic			0
the rest of the tickets will go to service members , veterans and their families			0
plus , @entity5 spokesman @entity119 said each ticket will have the name of the ticket holder printed on the front to prevent scalping			0
if the name on the ticket does n't match your @entity127 , no game for you			2
the @entity7 also needs the promoters and @entity48 , which plans to bring a dozen or more cameras to cover the game , to know that at any moment the president could order the @entity10 to leave port for a mission			1
which means the basketball courts , and bleachers would have to come off the ship just as 5,000 - plus sailors and @entity142 would have to come aboard			1
@entity119 said he has assured the @entity7 it would be prepared to break down both courts and all the seating very quickly if need be			1
" we can be off the ship 24 to 36 hours , " @entity119 said			0
to make sure of that , nothing will be bolted or welded to the ship			0
instead , they will use " tie - downs " that are already on the ship 's decks to hold warplanes in place			0
planes are not typically on board an aircraft carrier that is in its home port			0
the idea for a carrier - based basketball game started at @entity29			1
according to @entity119 , @entity109 athletic director @entity163 had the idea and head basketball coach @entity165 liked it			0
in a news release from @entity48 , @entity166 said , " as coaches and athletes , we are familiar with terms like wins and losses , but to our servicemen and women , those phrases have very different meanings			1
it 's a concept that first hit home during one of my trips to visit our troops in @entity184 , and one that i 've carried with me since then			0
" the @entity7 spent monday and tuesday with officials from the @entity4 , @entity5 , @entity48 and the @entity35 sports commission in detailed discussions about the game			1
they 've given the officials tours of the ship , let them see the areas that could be used for the game and the potential problems that could crop up			1
as if the idea of the first carrier - borne @entity4 game is n't enough to interest you , perhaps this will : former @entity108 star @entity202 and former @entity109 star @entity203 are the honorary captains for the game			2
and if the game goes off as planned and is successful , there are already talks about having more games , including a match - up between the @entity210 and @entity211 women 's basketball teams .			2

@entity7 is in talks for potential " @entity52 "
@entity48 would televise game if it pans out
two courts would have to be built to skirt weather woes
courts , bleachers would have to *vanish* if carrier ordered on a mission
