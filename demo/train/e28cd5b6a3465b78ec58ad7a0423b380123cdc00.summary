prosecutors are probing the case of @entity9 , who admits to having been a guard at the notorious @entity12 camp , where more than 1 million people , most of them @entity13 , were killed during @entity14 @entity9 , 87 , says he was only a perimeter guard and did not persecute anyone , according to legal papers related to his battle to keep his @entity6 citizenship			1
