-- " he knows if you 've been bad or good ... " does n't hold quite as much weight when @entity3 is vomiting on a @entity5 sidewalk into his gift bag			0
this is the ghost of @entity11 past , an annual event when thousands of revelers decked out in @entity15 costumes take to the bars of @entity17 to get into the spirit -- and spirits -- of the season			1
in recent years , city residents have publicly complained that the bad @entity22 far outweigh the good , citing highly publicized instances of extreme intoxication , lewdness and vandalism			2
in preparation for the now - infamous event , @entity28 and @entity29 railroads issued a temporary ban on alcoholic beverages on their trains , while community boards in the @entity37 and @entity38 neighborhoods of @entity5 and the @entity40 neighborhood of @entity41 said they will not allow the bar crawl to take place in their areas			0
" some of the stories that i 've heard about that certain neighborhoods do n't want them in their neighborhood , these are public streets			0
neighborhoods ca n't say to people you ca n't come on our public streets , " @entity51 , an attorney for @entity52 , told @entity0 affiliate @entity53			1
in an attempt to get back on the public 's nice list , @entity52 organizers hired @entity51 , a civil rights attorney , to help the group with street permits and to revitalize their image			1
they say they do more good than harm , raising money for charities like @entity69 and the @entity70 of @entity17			2
" even if you disagree with the content of the message of the group , they have the right to express that viewpoint , " @entity51 said			0
with " compassion " for the current civil rights protests going on around the country and public objection to @entity52 , the organizers have vowed to rein in the debauchery			1
on the @entity52 website , they encourage participants to moderate their drinking and behavior , and suggest they spend most of their time inside the venues versus out on the streets			1
" ... it 's more important this year than ever to pace yourself , watch out for your elves and stay safe			0
fighting , public urination and vandalism are unacceptable and a great way to ensure that there will be no @entity52 in 2015			1
# dontscroogesantacon , " the organizers said in a press release earlier this month			0
the event is scheduled to take place on saturday			2
the participating bars were announced on friday through @entity52 's app , and are located mainly in the @entity105 and @entity107 neighborhoods of @entity5			2
" if a venue is n't on this list , it 's because they do n't want you there , " the organizers emphasized .			0

@entity52 is being toned down this year *due* to public protest over the participants ' behavior
organizers say their roots are charitable and @entity22 should be allowed to *celebrate*
@entity52 will take place on saturday , *december* *13* , in @entity17
