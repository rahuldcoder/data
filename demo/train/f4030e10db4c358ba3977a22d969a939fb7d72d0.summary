-- as millions of students across the world go back to school this month , 178 students from 49 countries will turn on their computers and step onto the virtual campus of the world 's first global , tuition - free online university			1
lessons in learning : @entity12 is hoping to use the power of social networks to expand education			1
called @entity12 , the non-profit , @entity17 - based endeavor comes from @entity20 entrepreneur @entity19 who says he founded the school to provide higher education to those who might otherwise never have access to it			1
" our mission is to change people 's lives , " said @entity19 , who also is the chairman of @entity26 , an online study community for college students			1
starting in 1989 , @entity19 served as the head of @entity34 , an educational services company based in @entity20 , which he sold to @entity35 , one of the world 's largest test preparation companies , in 2005			2
he also chaired an online university affiliated with the @entity39			1
" we want to be an option for people who do n't have any other option , " he said			0
there has been no shortage of interest			0
since the school started enrolling students in april , nearly 2,000 people from 142 countries have applied			0
@entity19 says the online institution will need 15,000 students over the next four years in order to be sustainable and will need $ 6 million to fund the venture , of which $ 1 million he will provide			1
to attend , students must have a high school diploma , speak @entity57 and pay admission fees ranging from $ 15 to $ 50 , with those from poorer countries paying less and those from richer countries paying more			0
students will also have to pay to take exams			0
in all , it will cost around $ 4,000 for students to complete their studies and gain a qualification			0
the school initially will offer bachelor 's degrees in business administration and computer science			1
curriculum consists of around 40 courses , which will take between four and six years to complete			0
this year 's freshman class includes pupils ages 16 to 61			0
@entity77 has the highest number of students enrolled , followed by the @entity80 , @entity81 and @entity82			0
now that @entity12 has proven it can recruit students , the next challenge it faces is whether it can keep them enrolled			1
" that is a concern , " said @entity19			0
" one of the main issues with online universities is retention			1
" while e-learning has been booming in recent years -- in 2007 , nearly 4 million students in the @entity80 took at least one course online , according to the @entity94 , a nonprofit dedicated to integrating online learning into higher education -- a challenge educators often face is how to keep students engaged in virtual classrooms			1
make it social to try to solve this problem , the @entity12 is turning to an activity that already keeps millions of people occupied on the @entity103 everyday : social networking			1
the @entity12 's staff of volunteer and retired professors will post readings and lectures in an online repository for students to retrieve and study			1
materials come for free from other universities via platforms such as the @entity117 , which provides open access to the syllabi , lecture notes , exams and reading lists from 1,800 classes offered at @entity124			1
the university will also use course material from @entity127 , said @entity19			0
" basically what we do is we take everything that is out there and bring it together , " he said			0
after the students complete their homework , it is mandatory for them to link up with classmates online to discuss the week 's curriculum			1
unless a student needs special help , teachers will supervise discussions rather than lead them , said @entity19			0
" we believe the social networking we build around our programs will serve as a cement to keep students with each other and stay in our program , " said @entity19			1
" we are fitting the current culture into the academic culture			0
" however , online education experts are raising questions , particularly surrounding whether @entity12 can become accredited			1
to achieve accreditation , a college must prove it can meet a number of quality assurances set forth by an accrediting body , including breadth and depth of coursework and student test results			2
@entity19 said the university would apply for accreditation with an agency in the @entity80 but declined to disclose further plans			2
" we are not making any promises , " he told @entity0			0
@entity165 , executive director of the @entity94 , believes the @entity12 may face problems			1
" can you accredit something where students are learning themselves from materials ? maybe , " he told @entity0			2
" testing outcomes capability -- what students can do or how well students test -- may be a way the @entity12 can succeed in its model			1
" if that works , then that would be evidence accreditation might be warranted			2
i still think it will be hard			0
" new ways to learn however , there is evidence that could work in favor of the @entity12 's cause			1
a recent study conducted by the @entity80 @entity189 found that " on average , students in online learning conditions performed better than those receiving face - to - face instruction			1
" " the current methodology is based on the lecture , and that is a thousand - year - old model that is completely inappropriate with the new generation , " @entity197 , author of " @entity198 : how the @entity200 is @entity199 " , told @entity0			2
" if it is shown that there are better models of learning than the current model , then the credentialing function of the old model will be weakened , " said @entity197			2
" the internet is a new mode of production			0
it was inevitable that peers would come together and create an online university			2
" other organizations are also experimenting with @entity214 platforms , like social networking sites and blogs , to tap into the ways in which younger generations are wired to the web			2
in january , @entity221 , launched @entity221 , a social network platform around an online encyclopedia of freely - published scientific articles			1
like @entity226 , @entity221 users create personal profiles			0
unlike @entity226 , members share information about genetic research instead of exchanging vacation pictures			0
@entity221 started the venture in an attempt to reignite student interest in science , said @entity236 , publishing director of @entity221 , who noted that 40 percent of students in the @entity80 who start college studying science end up switching majors by the time they graduate			2
" one of the things we recognized is the materials being provided are not adequate for younger generations who are growing up in a world where information is dynamic , shareable and bite - sized , " said @entity236			1
" we are creating a global classroom for science and allowing people to freely collaborate			0
we want to put high quality teaching and learning materials into the hands of anybody and everybody who wants to become a scientist , " he added			2
" sharing data and sharing ideas and coming up with joint conclusions is at the heart of how science works			0
it is about leveraging each other 's knowledge and abilities			0
