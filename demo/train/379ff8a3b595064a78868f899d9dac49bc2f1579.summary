@entity0 -- a medical doctor in @entity3 , @entity4 , said thursday that @entity6 arson suspect @entity5 suffered from severe mental illness in 2010 , when she examined him as part of a team of doctors			1
dr. @entity11 , a family physician and specialist in obstetrics , said both @entity5 and his mother , @entity14 , were her patients in @entity3 while both were applying for refugee status in @entity18			1
" i was asked to diagnose and treat @entity5 to support a claim explaining why he was unable to show up in a small - claims court case , " @entity11 told @entity1 in a phone interview			2
she declined to cite the case or @entity5 's role in it			2
@entity11 said she and other doctors including a psychiatrist diagnosed @entity5 with " autism , severe anxiety , post-traumatic stress disorder and depression			1
" the diagnosis was spelled out in a letter she wrote for the small - claims court case , @entity11 said			0
@entity11 , citing doctor - patient confidentiality , would not elaborate further , nor would she identify the psychiatrist involved in the diagnosis			2
@entity5 , a 24 - year - old @entity35 national , has been charged with 37 counts of arson following a string of 52 fires in @entity0			1
the charges are in connection with arson fires at 12 locations scattered through @entity44 , @entity45 and @entity46 , according to authorities			2
@entity11 said the refugee applications by @entity5 and his mother were denied by the @entity18 government , and she has not seen @entity5 since early march of 2010			1
" i was shocked and dismayed at what happened in @entity0 , and it appears he was not being treated for his depression , " she said			1
@entity5 was in court on wednesday for a preliminary hearing			2
prosecutors said his " rage against @entity60 , " triggered by his mother 's arrest last week , motivated his " campaign of terror " with dozens of fires in @entity44 and nearby communities			0
@entity5 kept his eyes closed and remained limp during most of his hearing , requiring sheriff 's deputies to hold him up			0
the district attorney called his courtroom behavior " very bizarre			0
" " this defendant has engaged in a protracted campaign in which he has set , the people believe , upwards of 52 arson fires in what essentially amounts to a campaign of terror against this community , " @entity72 deputy district attorney @entity71 said			1
" the people believe he has engaged in this conduct because he has a hatred for @entity60			0
" @entity71 told the court @entity5 would flee the country if he was allowed out of jail on bond , but @entity89 judge @entity88 said he had no choice but to set bail			1
to go free while awaiting trial , @entity5 must post a $ 2.85 million bond and surrender his @entity35 passport			1
it was revealed that @entity5 is also under investigation for arson and fraud in relation to a fire in @entity101 , near @entity102 , @entity35			1
the worst arson sprees in the city 's history began last friday morning with a car fire in @entity44 that spread to apartments above a garage , but no new fires have happened since @entity5 was arrested monday , @entity0 district attorney @entity103 said			1
no one was hurt in the fires , but property damage costs are likely to reach $ 3 million , authorities said			0
@entity115 called it " almost attempted murder , " because people were sleeping in apartments above where @entity5 allegedly set cars on fire with incendiary devices placed under their engines			2
the criminal complaint filed wednesday also alleged that the fires were " caused by use of a device designed to accelerate the fire , " @entity115 said			0
" if found true , the allegation could mean additional custody time for the defendant			0
" " in numerous instances , the cars were parked in carports , resulting in the fires spreading to the adjacent occupied apartment buildings , " a sworn affidavit from a @entity0 arson investigator said			1
" the vast majority of these fires occurred late at night when the occupants of the apartment buildings were asleep			0
" investigator @entity142 's affidavit detailed @entity5 's behavior a day before the fires began , when he was in a federal courtroom during extradition proceedings for his mother			2
" while in the audience , the defendant ( @entity5 ) began yelling in an angry manner , ' f -- k all @entity60			0
' the defendant also attempted to communicate with his mother who was in custody			0
shortly thereafter , the defendant was ejected from the courtroom by @entity154 , " @entity142 wrote			0
@entity5 was arrested a day before on an international arrest warrant issued by a district court in @entity102 , @entity35 , said federal court spokesman @entity157			1
the 53 - year - old @entity35 woman is wanted on 16 counts of fraud and three counts of embezzlement , he said			0
the charges include an allegation that she failed to pay for a breast enhancement operation performed on her in 2004 , @entity157 said			0
most of the @entity35 charges , however , stem from phony real estate deals that @entity5 allegedly conducted between 2000 and 2006			1
" it is my opinion that the defendant 's criminal spree was motivated by his rage against @entity60 and that by setting these fires the defendant intended to harm and terrorize as many residents of the city and county of @entity0 as possible , " @entity142 wrote			2
a search of @entity5 's @entity44 apartment found newspaper clippings about the @entity0 fires and articles from @entity35 reporting similar car fires in @entity102 , @entity35 in september , 2011 , the investigator said			1
" it is my opinion based on my experience that it is highly likely the defendant has a history of setting arson fires in @entity35 before he came to the @entity60 , " @entity142 wrote			1
@entity5 's mother is scheduled for another extradition hearing friday , while he is due back in court for arraignment on january 24			0
meanwhile , both @entity196 are housed in a @entity0 jail .			0
