@entity0 , @entity1 -- in response to a video of a @entity1 man 's dispute with airport security officials , the @entity3 said monday it tries to be sensitive to individuals , but everyone getting on a flight must be screened			1
the video , in which software engineer @entity13 refuses an x-ray scan at the @entity16 , @entity1 , airport , has sparked a debate over screening procedures			1
@entity13 told @entity2 on sunday that he was surprised to see so many people take an interest in his refusal and the dispute with airport screeners that followed it			1
but he said he hoped the video will focus attention on what he calls a government invasion of privacy			1
" obviously , everybody has their own perspective about their personal screening , " @entity3 administrator @entity28 told @entity2			1
" the question is , how do we best address those issues ... while providing the best possible security ? " @entity13 , 31 , said his hunting trip to @entity38 was cut short before it even started saturday morning -- when @entity3 agents asked him to go through an x-ray machine			1
" i do n't think that the government has any business seeing me naked as a condition of traveling about the country , " @entity13 said			0
@entity28 said the agency is " trying to be sensitive to individuals issues and concerns , " but added , " the bottom line is , everybody who gets on that flight has been properly screened			0
" the cell phone video @entity13 recorded of his arguments with security screeners over the scan and pat - down they proposed had garnered than 200,000 hits on @entity58 by monday afternoon			1
@entity13 said that after he declined the body scan , a @entity3 agent told him he could have a pat - down instead			1
once the procedure was described , @entity13 said he responded , " if you touch my junk , i 'll have you arrested			0
" the dispute that followed , @entity13 said , included police escorting him from the screening area and a supervisor saying he could face a civil lawsuit for leaving the airport before security had finished screening him			1
in fact , @entity13 could face a civil penalty as high as $ 11,000 , according to @entity74 , the @entity3 's federal security director in @entity16 , who defended the behavior of his officers during the confrontation			1
" he 's violated federal law and federal regulations , which states once you enter and start the process you have to complete it , " he said			0
@entity13 called the whole incident ridiculous and said he will not fly " until these machines go away			2
" " advanced imaging technology screening is optional for all passengers , " the @entity3 said in a statement released monday			1
" passengers who opt out of [ advanced imaging ] screening will receive alternative screening , including a physical pat - down			2
" but anyone who refuses to complete the screening process will be denied access to airport secure areas and could be subject to civil penalties , the administration said , citing a federal appeals court ruling in support of the rule			2
the ruling , from the 9th @entity104 , says that " requiring that a potential passenger be allowed to revoke consent to an ongoing airport security search makes little sense in a post- 9/11 world			0
such a rule would afford terrorists multiple opportunities to attempt to penetrate airport security by ' electing not to fly ' on the cusp of detection until a vulnerable portal is found			0
" the @entity3 's advanced imaging technology machines use two separate means of creating images of passengers -- backscatter x-ray technology and millimeter - wave technology			1
at the end of october , 189 backscatter units and 152 millimeter - wave machines were in use in more than 65 airports			2
the total number of imaging machines is expected to be near 1,000 by the end of 2011 , according to the @entity3			1
the agency has previously said that the new technology is safe and protects passenger privacy			2
" strict privacy safeguards are built into the foundation of @entity3 's use of advanced imaging technology to protect passenger privacy and ensure anonymity , " the agency says in a statement on its website			1
images from the scans can not be saved or printed , according to the agency			0
and agents who directly interact with passengers do not see the scans			2
but @entity13 is n't the only one with concerns about the new security procedures			0
grass - roots groups are urging travelers either not to fly or to protest by opting out of the full - body scanners and undergoing time - consuming pat - downs instead			0
industry leaders are worried about the backlash			0
homeland security secretary @entity158 met with leaders of travel industry groups to discuss the concerns			0
" we certainly understand the challenges that @entity164 confronts , but the question remains , where do we draw the line ? our country desperately needs a long - term vision for aviation security screening , rather than an endless reaction to yesterday 's threat , " the @entity168 said in a statement after the meeting			2
" at the same time , fundamental @entity177 values must be protected			0
" during a press conference in which @entity180 announced the expansion of a security awareness campaign , she also reiterated the need for hand searches should a passenger decline electronic screening			2
" if you refuse the [ @entity189 ] altogether , then you can go to a separate area for a same - gender pat down , " she told reporters on monday			0
" if there are adjustments we need to make as we move forward , we have an open ear , " she said			0
" @entity2 's @entity195 , @entity196 , @entity197 and @entity198 contributed to this report .			0
