@entity0 , @entity1 -- wearing a stylish red dress and a beaming smile , celebrated fashion designer @entity5 sits comfortably inside her spacious living room in @entity0 , the vibrant seaside capital of @entity1 , as we discuss her inspirations			1
" my designing process starts always with me , " explains @entity9			0
" with what i want to wear ; with what is in my closet -- my style is multi-cultural , it 's eclectic , it 's the mix of my travels , it 's bold , it 's rocky , " she adds			0
" indeed , for more than a decade the @entity1 designer has been putting @entity18 fashion to global runways and clothing stores -- from @entity23 and @entity24 to @entity9 and @entity25			1
but besides spreading her stylish vision around the world , @entity9 is also bringing attention closer to home -- 12 years ago she founded @entity30 , a popular event allowing designers from all over @entity33 and beyond to showcase their colorful creations to fashion lovers and international media			2
" the fashion scene in @entity1 is so bold , " says @entity9 , whose real name is @entity39			1
" i have seen it grow like a baby and i am so proud to be a part of this			0
" @entity45 following the initial success of the @entity47 , @entity9 began receiving invitations to attend big designers ' shows in fashion capitals like @entity24 and @entity23			1
but whilst there , she quickly started feeling like an outsider			0
" i was really frustrated , " she says			0
" when i looked around there were so few black models and i felt like i was n't belonging there			1
" that frustration was behind @entity9 ' decision to start @entity45 in 2010 to help promote the talented black designers and models that she felt were being ignored by the industry			1
@entity9 held the inaugural event in the @entity66 , followed by editions in @entity9 , @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity70			0
" i thought it was right ... to try to do something to help my own people and to get more exposure , " she says			0
" it was not saying them they were wrong , it was saying , ' ok , we are here , ' " adds @entity9			0
" it was also a statement [ to ] the fashion industry , ' stop this discrimination , black is beautiful			1
' i am sick and tired of seeing only skinny blonde girls and not black women in the runway			1
" from the runway to the tv screen the daughter of diplomats , @entity9 spent much of her childhood traveling and soaking up other cultures before finally settling in @entity93 where she attended college			0
she first made a name for herself in the @entity93 capital but decided to bring her fashion home to @entity1 in 2001			1
now , with a thriving label and flourishing annual events under her belt , the fashion entrepreneur is taking on her next business venture -- @entity104			2
a two - year project in the making , @entity9 has had her heart set on creating a new avenue to promote local fashion talent			2
starting with a reality show she describes as the " equivalent of @entity114 , " @entity9 wants to provide new opportunities for aspiring young models from the continent			2
" we wanted really young girls and give them [ an ] opportunity to go outside @entity1 to model in @entity33 -- @entity121 , @entity122 [ and ] also in @entity123			2
this is going to be a big deal because it is probably going to start their career			0
" her other goal is to introduce viewers to alternative fashion designers			2
while there are currently channels devoted to fashion , @entity9 explains that they do n't show enough @entity18 inspiration and when they do , coverage tends to focus on designers from @entity121			1
" i want them to see us in @entity143 , @entity144 , @entity0			0
that was the purpose of this channel , " she says			0
" i want people to see we have great designers			0
and that 's what i 'm going to show -- @entity18 wearing @entity18 clothes , " adds @entity9			2
