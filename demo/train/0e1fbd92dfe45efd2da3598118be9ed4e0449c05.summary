-- @entity1 , the @entity2 ambassador to the @entity3 who drew heavy criticism from @entity5 over her statements after the september attacks on a @entity2 diplomatic mission , withdrew her name from consideration for secretary of state on thursday			1
in a letter to president @entity13 , she said " the confirmation process would be lengthy , disruptive , and costly -- to you and to our most pressing national and international priorities			1
that trade - off is simply not worth it to our country			0
" @entity13 acknowledged her letter in a statement that described her as " an extraordinarily capable , patriotic , and passionate public servant			2
" he will meet with @entity26 friday at the @entity27 , @entity25 spokesman @entity24 said			1
@entity26 's letter to the president she was thought to be a frontrunner for the post , which secretary of state @entity33 said she would vacate as soon as a successor is confirmed			1
@entity36 ' extremely upset ' with @entity26 's withdrawal but @entity26 drew criticism for her description of the september 11 , 2012 , attack on the @entity2 mission in @entity42 , @entity43 , which killed four including the @entity2 ambassador to @entity43 , @entity44			1
on several television programs several days after the attack , she described a protest of an anti-islam video outside the mission buildings			0
she said her comments were based on declassified talking points , and sources within the intelligence community said the talking points were not modified by any other body , such as the @entity27			0
she further explained her decision to withdraw and defended herself thursday in a piece for the @entity59 , writing : " i have never sought in any way , shape or form to mislead the @entity2 people			2
... even before i was nominated for any new position , a steady drip of manufactured charges painted a wholly false picture of me			0
" @entity13 had defended her , describing the criticism from several key republicans as " outrageous			0
" " if senator ( john ) mccain and senator ( @entity75 ) @entity74 and others want to go after someone , they should go after me , " @entity13 said at a @entity27 news conference in late november			0
" when they go after the @entity3 ambassador , apparently because they think she 's an easy target , then they 've got a problem with me			2
" she visited @entity85 in an attempt to answer what the legislators called " unanswered questions , " but her visit there appeared to backfire			0
senators who sat in on the meetings said her appearances raised more questions than they answered			0
5 questions on @entity1 her closed - door meetings " really hurt her , " one knowledgeable @entity99 source said			2
" she probably underestimated the club			0
" the longer @entity26 went un-nominated , the source said , the worse her prospects appeared			2
it was " better to get out now " so that @entity13 could begin announcing a national security slate as early as next week			0
in a statement , @entity106 called @entity26 " an indispensable partner over the past four years			2
" " from the @entity25 to the @entity109 to the @entity3 , @entity1 has worked tirelessly to advance our nation 's interests and values			1
i am confident that she will continue to represent the @entity2 with strength and skill , " @entity106 said			0
after @entity26 's thursday announcement , @entity74 said in a statement : " i respect ambassador @entity26 's decision			1
president @entity13 has many talented people to choose from to serve as our next secretary of state			1
" senate majority leader @entity123 described @entity5 opposition to @entity26 's possible nomination as " shameful			1
" " ambassador @entity26 is eminently qualified to serve as secretary of state and she could have been confirmed by the @entity128			1
the politically motivated attacks on her character from some of my @entity5 colleagues were shameful , " the @entity129 @entity36 said in a statement			1
" their behavior was a disgrace to the @entity128 's tradition of bipartisan cooperation on national security issues and beneath the stature of senators with otherwise distinguished records on national security			0
" @entity26 's decision to not seek the post now leaves sen. @entity148 , @entity149 , as the presumed frontrunner for the spot			1
defense secretary @entity152 and other high - ranking officials are also expected to depart soon			0
@entity148 praised @entity26 as " an extraordinarily capable and dedicated public servant " in a statement after her announcement			2
" i 've known and worked closely with @entity1 not just at the @entity3 , but in my own campaign for president			1
i 've defended her publicly and would n't hesitate to do so again because i know her character and i know her commitment , " he wrote			0
" we should all be grateful that she will continue to serve and contribute at the highest level			0
as someone who has weathered my share of political attacks and understands on a personal level just how difficult politics can be , i 've felt for her throughout these last difficult weeks , but i also know that she will continue to serve with great passion and distinction			2
" @entity148 's road to the @entity109 , should he be nominated , would appear to be smoother than @entity26 's			1
senate minority leader @entity172 said after @entity26 's announcement that @entity148 would be a " popular choice with the @entity128			1
" @entity13 's cabinet : who 's in , who 's out ? another @entity128 @entity5 , @entity178 of @entity179 , named @entity148 as one of @entity13 's " better choices " for the spot , according to the @entity183			1
but despite his lauded role assisting @entity13 in preparing for the presidential debates this fall , @entity148 is understood to be less of an @entity13 confidante than @entity26			2
@entity148 is a decorated veteran who served two tours of duty in @entity189 before his career as a lawyer and then in the @entity128			0
his assignments there include the chairmanship of the @entity195			0
should @entity148 step down before his term ends in 2014 , gov. @entity196 , a @entity36 , would appoint a temporary replacement to hold the seat until a special election could be held			0
the special election race would likely include sen. @entity202 , who won in a special election three years ago but lost his bid for a full term , as well as @entity99 rep. @entity206 , who is seriously considering a bid should @entity148 's seat open , a @entity99 source said			2
on thursday , sen. @entity210 , @entity211 said she had " respect " for @entity26 's decision , " however , my concerns regarding the terrorist attack in @entity42 go beyond any one individual			1
i remain deeply troubled by the continued lack of information from the @entity27 and the @entity109			0
with four of our public servants murdered , it is critical that we get to the bottom of what happened			0
" @entity210 told @entity0 after the late november meeting with @entity26 , @entity74 , and @entity225 , " certainly she misled the @entity2 public			2
" opinion : a lucky day for @entity1 former cia director @entity229 , who resigned last month after admitting to an extramarital affair , returned to @entity85 to testify on the attacks , and @entity106 is scheduled to testify next week			1
sen. @entity232 , the moderate @entity5 from @entity233 , said through a spokesman that the @entity235 , where she serves as ranking member , would continue its investigation into the @entity42 attack			1
she had raised her own questions about @entity26 's potential nomination after a private meeting with the ambassador			1
the thursday decision was @entity26 's own ; she was not asked to step aside in the consideration process , a former administration official who had knowledge of her decision said			1
" she has got a lot of honor , a lot of dignity , a lot of patriotism			0
this was a completely manufactured distraction , and she was determined to put her country first , " the former official said			0
" no nominee for secretary of state has been subjected to such a sustained campaign of politicization and slander			2
and it is really troubling			0
" @entity262 , who was the first woman to serve as secretary of state and has known @entity26 for decades , said @entity26 is " brilliant " and described her withdrawal from consideration as " sad			1
" " i think it is genuinely , genuinely sad because she is one of the smartest people that i know and completely dedicated to serving the @entity2 , " @entity262 told @entity0			0
@entity26 " put the country and the president ahead of her own ambition			1
it just shows what a tremendously thoughtful and good and responsible person she is			0
" in her letter to @entity13 , @entity26 wrote " the position of secretary of state should never be politicized			1
" " as someone who grew up in an era of comparative bipartisanship and as a sitting @entity2 national security official who has served in two @entity2 administrations , i am saddened that we have reached this point , even before you have decided whom to nominate , " she wrote			0
" we can not afford such an irresponsible distraction from the most pressing issues facing the @entity2 people			0
" @entity26 served in president @entity106 's administration on the @entity25 , eventually leading @entity295 affairs for the council and serving as a special assistant to the president			1
she was confirmed by the @entity128 as the top diplomat to the @entity3 in january 2009			0
if @entity26 had been nominated , she would have faced criticism from religious leaders about her role in the @entity106 administration 's handling of the @entity307 genocide in the 1990s			1
@entity2 rep. @entity308 , chairman of the @entity309 , said on @entity0 that @entity26 's decision was " probably for the best			1
" " i think ambassador @entity26 was facing an uphill battle in the senate for any confirmation she may have received , " he said			2
asked in an interview thursday on @entity316 whether she wanted the top diplomatic post , @entity26 replied that she " would have been very honored to serve in that job			2
" she added , " but yeah , sure			0
how can you not want to -- in my field -- serve at the highest possible level ? " opinion : an unfair portrait of @entity1 @entity0 's @entity325 , @entity326 , @entity327 , @entity328 , @entity329 , @entity330 , @entity331 and @entity332 contributed to this report			1

new : sen. @entity123 : @entity5 attacks on @entity26 's character were " shameful "
