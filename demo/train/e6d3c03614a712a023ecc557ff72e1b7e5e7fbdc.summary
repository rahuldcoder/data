editor 's note : @entity2 is a policy analyst and @entity3 is a @entity4 associate , both with the @entity6 's @entity5			0
the opinions expressed in this op - ed do not necessarily represent those of @entity10 or @entity11			0
( @entity10 ) -- if you 've followed broadband discussions in @entity14 , then you 've heard that wireless is the future of communications			2
the @entity18 offers wireless as the competitive solution to the broadband duopoly dilemma , and in the recently released @entity22 , president @entity21 reiterated his @entity24 commitment to helping " extend next - generation wireless services to at least 98 % of @entity26			1
" if you watch tv , you might think this is a good thing			0
the whole country is moving to @entity30 -- next generation wireless -- and according to some carriers , this is our chance to beat the world in broadband			1
for @entity21 , it 's a chance to win the @entity38			0
it will certainly help us win a future -- but if this , as @entity21 said , is our " @entity43 moment , " we are not reaching for the moon			0
defining " @entity30 " trying to understand @entity30 can give you a bit of a headache			2
some surveys show that most @entity26 have no idea what the term " @entity30 " means , but many plan to upgrade anyway			1
it 's faster -- and at times more expensive -- but will the technology bring us up to the same speed as other countries ? driving adoption of next - generation technology is essential for @entity26 's communications to catch up with the rest of the world ; our broadband networks , by most standards , stand in the middle of the pack on speed			1
however , the wireless upgrade path is not as straight as one might assume			0
the problem comes down to what " @entity30 " really means			2
the buzzwords flying around the @entity26 mobile space are @entity74 ( @entity74 ) , @entity75 + and @entity76			2
however , before this past december , the @entity77 ( @entity77 ) , the global standards - setting body responsible for ensuring some level of interoperability in mobile communications , had set the @entity83 as @entity84 -- technology that is not expected to be deployed until 2012 at the earliest			2
that month the @entity77 updated their policy , saying that " ' @entity30 , ' although it is recognized that this term [ is ] undefined , may also be applied to the forerunners of these technologies , @entity74 and @entity76 , and to other evolved 3g technologies providing a substantial level of improvement in performance and capabilities with respect to the initial third generation systems now deployed			2
" in other words , the term @entity30 can be applied to @entity74 and @entity76 , the leading technologies currently rolling out in the @entity26 and globally -- even though they are technically still 3g or ( in marketing speak ) @entity75 + , which might otherwise be more accurately defined as @entity100			1
getting beat abroad comparing wireless networks globally on the basis of @entity30 can be like comparing apples and oranges -- while @entity105 begets @entity30 , not all @entity30 is created equal			1
the real leap forward for next - generation deployments is defined not so much by technology but by speeds			2
certainly , in this context , the 4g - branded service available in the @entity26 does not compete with 4g service offered elsewhere			1
that 's not to say wireless speeds in the @entity26 are n't improving ; indeed , they are beginning to match the speeds of lower - end broadband connections			1
@entity118 , claiming the " @entity119 , most advanced @entity120 in @entity26 , " is rolling out @entity74 offering up to 5 - 12 mbps download speeds			2
@entity122 also claims the title of " fastest mobile broadband network " with two layers of @entity75 + and @entity74			0
@entity127 's wimax network is slightly slower at 3 - 6 mbps			0
@entity128 has focused on @entity75 + , claiming peaks of @entity130 , although speeds realized by users are considerably slower and @entity128 is pushing for the claim of largest , not fastest , network			0
while these speeds do bring next - generation mobile broadband up to the standard of wireline broadband connections , the @entity135 found that the average wired broadband speed is between 3 and 4 mbps			1
our past research has shown that broadband in the @entity26 is slower and pricier than service in other developed countries			1
this gap in speeds persists with the move to @entity30 wireless broadband			1
for example , @entity150 rolled out @entity74 services in major @entity154 and @entity155 countries including @entity156 , @entity157 , @entity158 , @entity159 and @entity160 last year with speeds that blow @entity30 offerings out of the water : " in normal circumstances , the average download speed is 20 - 80 mbit / s. " @entity167 mobile provider @entity166 is offering @entity74 service with @entity170 speeds on the low end while also offering downloads up to @entity173 on more expensive plans			1
@entity176 countries have made great progress in launching 4g services since 2006 , including @entity74 and @entity76 in @entity179 and @entity180			0
@entity181 , a @entity179 major mobile service provider , launched an @entity74 mobile data communication service called " @entity184 " in november 2010			0
in its coverage area of five major cities , @entity184 boasts maximum downlink speeds of @entity189			0
@entity180 is also ahead of the @entity26 in @entity30 speeds			1
mobile provider @entity191 began @entity76 service offering a maximum speed of @entity194 down and @entity195 up in @entity196			0
we can do better president @entity21 threw down the gauntlet with his " @entity200 " rhetoric in the @entity24 speech			0
the comment implicitly referenced the missile gaps and past technological races of yesteryear , but the @entity22 may fall short of those heady days of innovation			0
for instance , the goal of 98 % of @entity26 's receiving @entity30 speeds may have already been met , if one believes the carrier estimates			1
@entity122 says that it has " completed its deployment of @entity75 + to virtually 100 percent of its mobile broadband network " and it claims that 300 million people are covered			0
those engaged in the effort to free up an additional @entity217 of spectrum , as the @entity18 recommends , must recognize the value of connectivity through unlicensed spectrum with nearly 40 percent of smartphone connectivity through unlicensed @entity223			0
by definition , a 4g roll - out alone does not bring @entity26 up to speed			1
the @entity77 has applied the term to describe capable technology but it does not define the actual service received by the consumer			0
services branded @entity30 in the @entity26 meet the unambitious @entity18 universalization goals , but they are not next - generation services when compared to speeds in other countries			1
our mobile communications will suffer from a generation gap -- whether the technology is called " @entity30 " or not			1

whole country is moving to @entity30 -- next generation wireless
@entity26 broadband networks , by most standards , stand in the middle of the pack on speed
4g - branded service available here does not compete with 4g service offered elsewhere
