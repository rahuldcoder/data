-- it was an emotional night for @entity3 's ruler @entity2 as @entity4 rode @entity5 to victory in the @entity7 , the world 's richest race , beating his stablemate @entity10 by an impressive margin			1
but the result was somewhat overshadowed by the death of another @entity15 horse , @entity16 , in the inaugural @entity17 , held earlier in the evening			1
the @entity19 - trained stayer appeared to break his leg approximately 300 meters into the race , pitching his jockey , @entity22 , to the ground in front of a packed @entity26 grandstand			1
it was immediately clear the injury was serious as veterinarians rushed on to the track to attend the stricken @entity16			2
however , when it became clear they would not be able to move him out of the way in time for the second lap of the race , the race was stopped and the remaining jockeys gradually pulled their horses up			0
@entity16 was euthanized , while @entity40 fortunately escaped uninjured after his high speed fall			0
the @entity17 was eventually re-run at the end of the day 's card , when it was won by @entity45 on @entity46 , but two horses failed to finish			0
@entity4 pulled up his mount @entity48 and @entity50 suffered a similar fate on the hard ground			0
there had been more to celebrate in the @entity7 itself , @entity4 cementing his reputation for exuberance by rising in his stirrups in celebration well before the finish line , echoing his win in last year 's @entity61			2
@entity15 's @entity19 had saddled both @entity5 and @entity10 , and told @entity0 he felt " incredible " about the result in only his second full season with @entity15 , @entity2 's vast racing operation			1
@entity2 himself , speaking exclusively to @entity0 after the race , said he felt " doubly happy " with the result , which saw the @entity7 return to @entity15 hands after a six - year absence			2
" we have n't won this race for a few years so to win it really it 's great , great feeling , " he said " not only for me but for the @entity73 and all our people			0
