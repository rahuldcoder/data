-- for @entity1 , the " @entity4 " event he 'd been waiting for happened when he was in church			2
@entity1 was in the pews at a baptist church in @entity7 , @entity8 , on sunday morning when a text message notified him his 24 - year - old daughter could not only breathe on her own , but also talk for the first time in weeks			1
it was a major milestone for @entity13 , who is battling a flesh - eating bacteria that has already led surgeons to amputate her hands , part of her abdomen , one of her legs and her remaining foot in an effort to stay ahead of the disease			1
family counters flesh - eating bacteria with faith " i was so excited i wanted to spring up out of the pew and into the aisle and do a dance , " @entity1 posted on the family 's website monday			1
" my fellow @entity33 probably would not have appreciated that , so i resisted the urge			2
instead , my fingers danced across my phone			2
" two weeks ago , in a post on his @entity39 page , @entity1 wrote that the family would mark that milestone " forever for the rest of your life			2
" it would be several hours before he was able to see his daughter -- she had put off her family for much of the day after being given a drug that caused nausea and intestinal cramps , and @entity1 said he was doing " emotional backflips " the entire time			2
but when he did see her sunday evening , " @entity13 was expressive and she clearly elucidated her thoughts , " he wrote			1
" her long - term memory was intact			1
we listened to the @entity57 that @entity58 of @entity59 had sent her , and she told me the story of @entity63 lyricist @entity62 , " @entity1 wrote			2
" we discussed ideas of how to utilize wilderness therapy / eco-psychology for amputees			2
we talked about her current physical condition			2
we smiled and at times we said nothing			0
just being there and seeing her happiness put a certain peace in my heart			0
" and on monday , " @entity13 continues to talk and joke , " he added			1
" her nurse bumped her head and @entity13 said , ' now my nurse needs a nurse ! ' then she winked at us and said , ' i 'll take care of her			0
' she then waved her arm in the air and said , ' these fingers can work magic			0
' she grinned at us			0
she knew she did n't have any fingers , but she 's not worried about it either			0
she knows everything is going to be fine			0
we know everything is going to be fine			0
we all know it is going to be a long and challenging road , but we will handle it together			0
" father : ' i have never seen such a strong display of courage ' @entity98 was taken off a ventilator may 20 and had been mouthing words without sound for several days before her voice was heard , her family said			1
her ordeal began may 1 , when she was riding a makeshift zip line across the @entity105 , about 50 miles west of @entity106			1
the line snapped , and she fell and got a gash in her left calf that took 22 staples to close			0
three days later , still in pain , she went to an emergency room			0
doctors eventually determined she had necrotizing fasciitis caused by the flesh - devouring bacteria @entity117			1
her father has written regularly since about her situation , with over 72,500 " likes " on his @entity39 blog devoted to @entity13 's fight			1
and the psychology department at the @entity124 -- where @entity13 has been pursuing her master 's degree in psychology -- also posted regular updates online			0
a number of bacteria that are common in the environment but rarely cause serious infections can lead to the disease			1
when it gets into the bloodstream -- such as through a cut -- doctors typically move aggressively to excise even healthy tissue near the infection site in hopes of ensuring none of the dangerous bacteria remain			1
the disease attacks and destroys healthy tissue and is fatal about 20 % of the time , according to the @entity145			0
dr. @entity146 , chairman of the @entity147 at the @entity148 , estimates that fewer than 250 such cases occur each year in the @entity150 , though estimates are imprecise since doctors do not have to report the cases to health authorities			1
since @entity1 's struggle came to light , there have been reports of others fighting the same disease			0
they include @entity162 , a @entity164 woman also diagnosed earlier this month , a few days after giving birth to twins			1
she has had at least 11 " debridement surgeries " but thus far no amputations , with her brother @entity168 noting late last week that the condition is confined to his sister 's legs and she , too , is breathing on her own .			0

@entity174 began speaking sunday , her father says
she " continues to talk and joke " on monday , he says

the infection has cost her her hands , a leg and her remaining foot
