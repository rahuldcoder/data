@entity0 , one of the most elite and selective boarding high schools in the country , failed again to elect a girl to its top student position -- the school presidency			1
since the school went co-ed in 1973 , only three girls have held this office			1
in a letter that launched a fiery debate across its campus , senior girls implored their peers to look hard at the school 's " staggering gender imbalance " in student leadership			1
headmaster @entity23 responded by telling the @entity24 , " girls have not had equal access to top leadership positions			1
" yet , access for girls is rarely the problem when it comes to pursuing leadership			1
feeling authorized to take leadership roles is the problem			1
from childhood to adolescence , girls face mixed messages about displaying power and authority			1
the girls at @entity39 and elsewhere are socialized to be likeable , to please others , to not tout their own successes and to speak softly like proper girls			2
as a result , they face powerful psychological barriers to attaining leadership roles			2
the impact of what i call the " curse of the good girl " effect first appears in friendships , when young girls take pains to avoid direct conflict with peers			2
" i want to tell her how i feel , " a typical girl would say in my research interviews , " but what if she hates me or turns other people against me ? " these girls often resorted to gossip and other forms of indirect communication , or they internalize their feelings in unhealthy ways			1
over time , pretending not to be angry with a friend when you are , or turning to a text messages instead of having an honest conversation , becomes a formative habit of communication			2
meanwhile , the muscles that girls need to assert their strongest feelings and opinions atrophy			2
by the time girls join sports teams and school organizations , many have imported these social habits into student leadership contexts			1
in a study by the @entity86 , girls from 8 to 17 worried that leadership positions would make them seem " bossy " and lead to negative attention from peers			2
by college , a skills and confidence gap becomes apparent			0
on the nearly 40 college campuses that run @entity95 , a program that trains women to run for student government , female students comprise over half of the student body but only hold about a third of the executive positions in student government			0
a study by @entity105 and @entity106 , co-authors of " it still takes a candidate : why women do n't @entity115 , " found that self - doubt plagues young women ages 18 to 25 who are considering a run for public office			0
in contrast , their male peers were 60 % more likely to view themselves as " very qualified			0
" parents , too , play a role			0
the same study shows that parents are key influencers in a girl 's decision to run for office			0
not only did the data show that many more boys than girls are encouraged by a parent to run for office , but half of the students whose mothers suggested they run said they would like to in the future , compared with only 3 % of those who got no nudge			0
everyone -- women and men -- need to be more aware of the social cost of punishing girls for being too assertive			0
just as a woman becomes instantly less likeable when she asks for a raise -- as research indicates -- a teenage girl can lose social standing when she seems too opinionated			0
the penalties are different , but the message is the same : be too " bossy " or say too much , and you will pay the price			0
the potential for a girl to become a leader seems over before it even begins			0
we can help girls feel more confident as leaders by teaching them the right skills early on , such as talking to a person you do n't know or negotiating a compromise			1
organizations such as the @entity162 teach girls as young as 5 to express their feelings with friends and how to be assertive			0
our educators should consider integrating leadership skill instructions into lesson plans			0
the @entity169 recently convened a conference on girls ' leadership to address the public leadership gender gap			1
as the father of two girls , president @entity174 must understand how important it is to educate girls so that they can grow up and become leaders -- if they so choose			1
it is time for all of us to help close that gap .			2

at *prestigious* @entity0 , only three girls have been school president
@entity187 : the real problem is that girls do n't feel authorized to be leaders
she says girls from childhood *onward* get mixed messages about displaying power
@entity187 : awareness and education can help close the leadership gender gap
