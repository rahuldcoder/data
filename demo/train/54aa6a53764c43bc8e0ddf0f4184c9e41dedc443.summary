-- @entity1 still has n't bought her holiday plane tickets			1
@entity4 wants to take her two children , ages 7 and 4 , back to her @entity7 , @entity8 , hometown for @entity9 this year			1
but there 's added pressure on the @entity13 , resident : her parents ' 50th wedding anniversary party is scheduled during the same visit			0
if she ca n't use frequent flier miles to reduce her bill , she expects to spend $ 1,100 to $ 1,300 on three tickets			1
because she wants to keep costs low , she plans to stick to her usual strategies of checking prices every few days and comparing prices at different departure and arrival airports			1
" i always wait a bit and try to game the pricing but still get flights i want , " she says			0
she may not want to wait much longer			0
prices are going up holiday airfares appear to be going up , the result of the usual higher demand for airline tickets around the holidays , airline mergers , flight cutbacks and higher airline fuel prices			1
people are also being charged more to check luggage , for coach seats with extra leg room and aisle seats , making it harder to seat families together at the last minute			2
@entity54 's airfare " price to beat " for @entity52 is $ 386 -- an increase of 9 % over last year , according to the company 's analysis of its @entity52 data			1

this year 's @entity52 fares " are $ 5 below our price to beat for july 4 of this year , " says @entity58 , senior editor at @entity54			1
" so while year - over - year prices are up , @entity52 fares are about what we were seeing this summer on popular travel weekends			1
" do expect " peak travel day " surcharges of $ 20 to $ 40 each way during the holiday season , says @entity58			1
travelers may find lower prices if they do n't travel on november 21 and 25 , december 22 , 23 and 26 and january 2 , check multiple departure and arrival airports and book packages for flight and hotel			1
if airline fuel costs continue to rise , " it should indicate a steady rise in ( ticket ) prices through the end of december and beginning of january , " she says			1
" it 's not a time of year where you 're going to see incredibly deep discounted flights			2
use our ' price to beat ' as a gauge of whether or not you 're getting a good deal			0
" people are willing to spend more demand does n't appear to be letting up			0
some 84 million @entity93 say they are traveling this holiday season , up 7 % from last year , according to recent data from the @entity95			1

still ways to save ? flexible travelers may still find ways to save , says @entity128 , founder of @entity129			0
" most airlines will let you book or put a fare on hold and cancel by midnight the next day for free , " he says			0
" put it on hold or book it , and if it goes down the next day , then book the lowest fare			0
you can keep doing that until the fare goes down			0
" ( if it does , that is			0
) remember that certain airlines do n't charge for checked bags and some airline credit cards may offer free checked baggage for cardholders			0
( do n't forget the presents ! ) consider an upgrade			0
" coach may be packed but this may be the time to upgrade " because business travelers tend to stay home over the holidays			0
" you 'll go online and see your flight is double the amount of miles usually charged , but you may be able to get first or business class for that same amount of miles , " says @entity128			0
plan ahead next year and there 's always the takeaway lesson : put buying airline tickets on your calendar a few months before the holidays to try to get a decent fare next year			1
it may pay to plan ahead			0
