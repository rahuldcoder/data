-- you would think that a black man born and raised in @entity3 , who was a teenager during the civil rights movement , would understand the transition of african - americans from voting overwhelmingly @entity7 to strongly supporting the @entity8			1
but the @entity7 presidential candidate clearly did n't have the common sense that he often speaks of having when he went on @entity0 's " @entity11 " and accused many african - americans of being brainwashed to vote @entity8			1
" many african - americans have been brainwashed into not being open - minded , not even considering a conservative point of view , " @entity13 said			1
" i have received some of that same vitriol simply because i am running for the @entity7 nomination as a conservative			1
" so it 's just brainwashing and people not being open - minded , pure and simple			0
" @entity13 's off - base and historically ignorant comments have received widespread coverage			1
in some quarters , they have been criticized , while @entity28 's @entity27 , who has a long history of racially offensive comments , did n't surprise many by coming to @entity13 's defense			1
it 's not the first time i 've heard someone question the reasons for blacks ' allegiance to the @entity8 , but history has to be taken into account			0
according to the @entity44 , a think tank focused on @entity46 issues , in the aftermath of the @entity48 , black folks who could vote in the @entity42 quickly joined the @entity7 out of affection for president @entity50			1
check the political party affiliation of blacks elected during the period of @entity55 and you will see a lot of @entity58 's after their names			0
the policies of presidents @entity61 and @entity62 , who desegregated the military , led more african - americans to vote for the @entity65			0
still , @entity66 got 39 percent of the black vote when he ran for re-election in 1956 ; and vice president @entity69 received 31 percent against the eventual winner , sen. @entity71			2
the shift became more noticeable in 1964 , when the @entity7 nominated sen. @entity73 as its presidential nominee			2
it was @entity73 's ardent stance against the @entity77 that led president @entity78 to garner 94 percent of the black vote			2
what 's interesting to note is the greatest threat to passage of the bill came from white @entity65 , known as @entity84			0
moderate @entity85 played a crucial role in getting the @entity77 passed , yet as the @entity7 began to go against civil rights , the @entity88 saw a chance to solidify the black vote			1
in 1968 , @entity69 returned to the national stage with his @entity92 , a detailed plan of racial politics that ignored , denigrated and dismissed black voters while playing up racial issues as a way to gain support from white voters			1
all of this was an outgrowth of the 1964 @entity77 , which led president @entity78 to say his signing of the law would deliver the @entity105 to the @entity7 for the next generation			2
the @entity92 became the go - to play for @entity85 over the next 40 years , as they virtually ignored the interests of black voters and catered to a largely white party			1
so on one hand you have a party that totally ignores black voters -- the @entity7 -- and then you have @entity65 who see a chance to capture those same voters			1
if @entity85 today are angry about a high level of animosity coming from black voters , they need to blame their white forefathers who wanted to see the racial divide continue over their refusal to allow @entity46 - @entity46 to be full citizens of the @entity42			1
the problem is that the @entity7 has done little to change the game since then , virtually ignoring african - americans and advocating policies that blacks believe go against their interests			1
what is so shameful and asinine about @entity13 's " brainwashing " comment is that he assumes that african - americans are n't smart and sophisticated enough to make their own choices			1
just like whites , @entity135 , hispanics , women , @entity138 , @entity139 , @entity140 , @entity142 bankers , or any other voting group , they look at the candidates , determine how they line up with their views , and make a selection			0
so when someone says that blacks do n't vote with their brains , that 's utterly false			0
now , for all of the trolls who usually populate web sites comments sections saying i 'm playing the race card , answer this : if i said that @entity105 whites were a bunch of brainwashed , dead heads who give the @entity7 their vote , how would you respond ? @entity167 statistics show that of the 10 poorest states in @entity42 , nine are mostly red states			1
the lowest when it comes to education ? mostly red states			0
the most obese ? worst health care ? mostly red states			0
so if the talking points suggest the @entity65 advance poverty programs more than the @entity7 ; push for more funding for education ; and want a strong health care program , then why are these white voters in these mostly red states voting for the @entity7 ? have they been brainwashed by virtue of the @entity92 to keep voting straight ticket ? the @entity7 has no real plan to even talk to black voters			1
they are afraid of them			0
if you want to put a @entity7 in the most uncomfortable position , then see them try to give a speech in front of a room of black folks			1
there is mistrust on both sides rather than straight talk on the issues			0
for years i have lamented the @entity7 's refusal to engage @entity46			2
we care about housing , economic development , education , any host of issues			0
but in the minds of a lot of @entity85 , it 's all about welfare or affirmative action			0
african - americans are largely social conservatives , but the @entity7 ca n't even figure out how to reach us even with @entity213 ! i 'm the host of @entity214 , a weekly sunday morning news show on @entity216 , a lifestyles and entertainment network targeting african - americans , and the @entity7 flat out refuses to even accept our invitations			2
for two years we 've had an open invite for any @entity222 or @entity223 @entity7 to come on our show , no matter the week			2
out of 80 - plus shows , rep. @entity226 of @entity3 ( twice ) and rep. @entity227 of @entity228 ( once ) have accepted our invitations			0
@entity227 sat in my studio and told his press secretary to send an e-mail to every @entity7 press secretary in the @entity222 to tell them that my show was a great forum for them to talk to @entity46			2
when @entity237 was chairman of the @entity238 , he did my show several times			0
@entity237 told me he went to the @entity222 and @entity223 leadership to tell them they should accept my invites , but none did			0
now if the @entity7 is scared to even come on a tv show that targets blacks , do you actually think they 'll show up in a black community ? if the @entity7 wants black folks to consider voting for them , they their candidates will have to make an effort to reach out			1
the distrust is wide and great , but it can be overcome			0
but doing nothing will get you nowhere , other than guarantee that a strong voting bloc will do all it can to make sure you are defeated at the polls			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity258 .			2

@entity13 said that black voters were " brainwashed " to support *democrats*
@entity258 says @entity13 is ignoring ample historical reason for that support
*republicans* had substantial black support but adopted a *strategy* that *spurns* them , he says
@entity258 : if @entity7 wants black support , it has to make its case to black voters
