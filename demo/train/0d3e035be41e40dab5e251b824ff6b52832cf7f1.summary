-- president @entity2 is seriously considering withdrawing all @entity4 troops from @entity5 in 2014 , a senior administration official told @entity0			1
the official 's comments came after the @entity8 reported the administration was looking at speeding up the troop withdrawal to the " zero option , " leaving no @entity4 troops in @entity5			2
until now , @entity4 and @entity5 officials had been discussing plans to keep a small force behind to fight insurgents and to train @entity5 security personnel			1
but @entity2 has , in recent months , grown increasingly frustrated in dealing with @entity5 president @entity18			1
their relationship soured further last month after the @entity4 and the @entity21 planned peace talks			0
in response , @entity18 cut off negotiations with the @entity4 on the residual troop presence post- 2014			2
a " zero option " has always been among the scenarios the @entity4 envisioned			0
but the new revelation means that it could be a very possible one now			0
@entity30 spokesman @entity29 said tuesday that @entity2 has not made a decision on @entity4 troop levels in @entity5 beyond 2014			1
