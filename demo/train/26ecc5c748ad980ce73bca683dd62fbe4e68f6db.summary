-- clairvoyance and a poker face are among the qualities @entity5 hotelkeepers should cultivate when dealing with foreign guests , according to a guide issued by the country 's tourism body			1
" anticipate all of the needs of a @entity13 visitor " but avoid " exchanging a smile or making eye contact with anyone from @entity17 you do n't know " are among a list of peculiar dos and don'ts prepared for the tourist industry by @entity23			1
the guide comes after a similar initiative by the @entity26 tourist board last year , which said @entity27 were fond of physical contact and taxis and the @entity30 enjoy free things and late dinners , among other things			0
@entity34 , the hotelkeeper star of the hit @entity5 sitcom who constantly referred to @entity37 among his @entity39 guests , appears to have cast a long shadow if the alternately bizarre and blindingly obvious etiquette guide is any indication			2
" do n't describe a visitor from @entity46 as ' @entity47 , ' " or " ask superstitious people from @entity49 to sleep in a historic property , " the list , which has been derided in the @entity5 press , instructs			1
" @entity53 are amiable but have a tendency to change their minds , " the advice , clearly unafraid of overgeneralization , goes on			0
travel dos and don'ts @entity58 : do n't cram avoid housing @entity58 -- ' a " tall nation " ' -- in cramped rooms , it says , possibly having missed that @entity63 , surely among the most globe - trotting of his countrymen , measures in at an un-towering 170 centimeters ( 5 ' 6 " )			1
and as for @entity39 , " deal promptly with any complaint " from them , lest they become even more " rude and aggressive " than they can already appear			0
finally , the guide 's clearly well - traveled authors advise , do n't mention @entity72 or , strictly , " do n't try to talk to @entity72 about their country 's politics or language divisions " -- which must amount to almost the same thing			2
the following is the full list of do 's and don'ts that @entity23 defended to the @entity80 , as " unrivalled ... market intelligence			2
" dos and don'ts do : understand that @entity53 are amiable but have a tendency to change their minds quite frequently			0
do : ensure tourists from @entity58 -- a " tall nation " -- are housed in rooms with high ceilings and doorways			1
do : realize that @entity90 people are being endearing when they make jokes about " @entity92 " [ @entity90 slang for @entity5 people ]			0
do : anticipate all of the needs of a @entity13 visitor -- even if they have n't told you what they are			1
do : deal promptly with any complaint from @entity39 or @entity103 tourists , who can be " straightforward and demanding " to the point of " seeming rude and aggressive			0
" do n't : ask superstitious people from @entity49 to sleep in a historic property or a four - poster bed , because they associate them with ghostly encounters			0
do n't : exchange a smile or make eye contact with anyone from @entity17 who you do not know			0
do n't : describe a visitor from @entity46 as " @entity47			1
" do n't : try to talk to @entity72 about their country 's politics or language divisions			0
do n't : say " no " in a direct way to a @entity13 tourist -- instead think of a " nicer alternative			1
" @entity124 's first tourism law comes into effect , tourists issued manners guides			2

tourism body issues bizarre do 's and don'ts list for dealing with foreign hotel guests
do give @entity58 a room with high ceilings -- they are tall , it says
and anticipate everything a @entity13 visitor needs
