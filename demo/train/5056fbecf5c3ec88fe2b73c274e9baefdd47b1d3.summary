especially in @entity1 , where what is permissible -- to say , to do , to be seen as saying or doing -- is an ever - changing thing			1
it took us many years of trying to finally be allowed into @entity1 , the country with whom the @entity6 has probably its most contentious relationship			1
at the time , we thought that perhaps our welcome was an indicator of a new attitude , an opening of a window			0
but as it turned out , that is probably not the case			0
the window appeared to slam shut in particularly ugly fashion shortly after our departure			0
what we saw , what we came back with , is a deeply confusing story			1
because the @entity1 you see from the inside , once you walk the streets of @entity28 , meet @entity1 , is a very different place than the @entity1 we know from the news			1
nowhere else i 've been has the disconnect been so extreme between what one sees and feels from the people and what one sees and hears from the government			2
@entity1 's official attitude toward @entity6 , its policies , its actions in the region , are a matter of record			1
how it treats its own citizens , as far as their personal behaviors , also is a matter of record			0
you do not want to be perceived as behaving inappropriately in @entity1 -- as we have seen with the recent video of kids dancing along to the song , " happy			2
" and what is inappropriate is an ever - shifting thing			0
what the " government " or the president says is ok one day might be deemed dangerous or unacceptable by the clergy or the " basij " , the roving , unofficial but official religious police , on another -- as we came to find out .			0

@entity65 *explores* an @entity1 few @entity6 have visited since the *1980s*
" what we saw , what we came back with , is a deeply confusing story , " he says
there 's a stark difference in *impressions* of the people versus the government
