-- the date , in that long - gone @entity1 spring , was the same as today 's : may 19			1
the event is mostly forgotten , lost to the mists of history			2
many people -- probably most people -- have never heard about it			1
and the question , on this anniversary of that @entity11 , is : in our constantly connected world , a world in which we are always in touch , always seemingly in the know , could the kind of fear that all but paralyzed the young nation that day still happen ? on that day in 1780 , at around noon , much of @entity21 -- meaning much of the new @entity1 -- went black			1
at midday , it was midnight			2
this was not an electrical blackout , of course ; homes and businesses did not have electricity in those years , and were illuminated by lanterns and candles			2
rather , the sky turned a deep , complete and unrelenting black , erasing the sun. it was not an eclipse			1
it was not a thunderstorm			2
imagine , in the middle of a day in may , every bit of light suddenly and inexplicably disappearing from your world			1
they waited for the darkness to lift			2
@entity46 began to feel like months			0
one contemporaneous observer in @entity48 , @entity49 , a professor at @entity51 -- the " university at @entity53 , " as he identified it -- wrote : " the birds having sung their evening song disappeared and became silent			0
the fowls retired to roost			0
... objects could not be distinguished but at a very little distance ; and every thing bore the appearance and gloom of night			0
" as the daytime hours of blackness wore on , some people , according to historical accounts , began to think that there might never be light again			1
there was widespread supposition that @entity69 may have come			1
in the @entity72 legislature , @entity70 rose to vigorously oppose his colleagues ' wish to adjourn : " i am against adjournment			0
the day of judgment is either approaching , or it is not			1
if it is not , there is no cause for adjournment ; if it is , i choose to be found doing my duty			0
" the blackness would last for the rest of the afternoon , past twilight and into full night			0
the next day , the sun would return			2
people hurried to churches to offer prayers of thanksgiving			2
centuries later , scientists would surmise that the @entity11 -- widely known as @entity94 's @entity93 --- was the result of massive wildfires burning in the forests of @entity98			1
researchers from the @entity100 postulated that the smoke from the fires was so thick and so deep in hue , so voluminous , that when , agonizingly slowly , it drifted over @entity21 , it gave the illusion that the sun had died			1
today some people may scoff at what might seem like gullibility on the part of those early @entity1			1
but bear in mind that there were no telephones ; there was no radio or television ; there was no telegraph			0
people often lived far away from their nearest neighbor			2
they knew little of what , at a given moment , was happening outside the patch of land where they resided			0
the one thing a person could always count on -- that the sun would come up in the morning and stay up until evening -- suddenly could not be counted on at all			0
the @entity128 was still being fought			0
those 13 @entity130 colonies on a sliver of the @entity132 were the forerunners of what would become the 50 @entity1			0
so the citizens , many feeling completely isolated on the eastern edge of a continent that remained largely unexplored , might be excused for fearing the worst			0
the poet @entity139 would write of that day : " over the fresh earth and the heaven of noon , a horror of great darkness , like the night in day of which the @entity145 sagas tell , the @entity147			2
the low - hung sky was black with ominous clouds , save where its rim was fringed with a dull glow , like that which climbs the crater 's sides from the red hell below			1
birds ceased to sing , and all the barn - yard fowls roosted ; the cattle at the pasture bars lowed , and looked homeward ; bats on leathern wings flitted abroad ; the sounds of labor died ; men prayed , and women wept ; all ears grew sharp to hear the doom - blast of the trumpet shatter			1
. " so it was on may 19 , 1780			1
on may 19 , 2013 , with all of our vaunted communication abilities -- 24 - hour television news , universal cellphones , @entity177 , @entity178 , the all - but - countless ways to stay in touch -- would such an event merit merely a shrug ? would we figure out within minutes what was transpiring , and why , and would we wait patiently for the sun to reappear ? perhaps			1
but consider what happens when the power goes out -- when , without warning , we lose artificial light			0
consider the confusion and anger and uncertainty that often commences			0
would we really be calm and unconcerned if , just as suddenly , real light -- the sun 's light -- without notice went away ? or would our cherished communications tools spread rumors of conspiracies and attacks and impending doom ? would those tools create panic instead of prevent it ? @entity139 , in his poem , wrote of the cessation of the day of darkness : " and , shore - ward , o'er the waters gleamed , from crest to crest , a line of light , such as of old , with solemn awe , the fishers by @entity213 saw			1
. " @entity214 ; love of the light			0
some things change as the years pass			0
others , we are from time to time reminded , remain eternal			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity222 .			1

on may 19 , 1780 , the skies over @entity21 inexplicably turned black
the day was pitch - black ; people panicked , prayed , thought it was the @entity69
researchers believe that massive forest fires in @entity98 contributed
@entity222 asks : would people today , knowing the cause , be as frightened ?
