@entity0 -- a @entity3 panel voted thursday to subpoena the @entity3 for documents related to the solar energy company @entity6			1
the @entity8 's subcommittee on oversight and investigations voted along party lines , 14 to 9 , in favor of issuing the subpoenas for internal documents regarding the decision to issue more than half a billion dollars in federal loan guarantees in 2010 to @entity6 , which later filed for bankruptcy			1
the decision followed a contentious debate among subcommittee members , with republicans accusing the @entity22 administration of stonewalling , and some democrats calling the subpoena resolution politically motivated			0
rep. @entity25 , the @entity20 chairman of the subcommittee , said the @entity34 earlier this year " repeatedly failed to cooperate with our investigation and we agreed to put off a vote on that subpoena " in hopes that engaging the @entity3 could avoid the need for subpoenas			1
" only after repeated failed attempts to engage the @entity3 did the committee notify the @entity3 " that it intended to discuss possible subpoenas , @entity25 said			1
" this finally got the attention of the @entity3 counsel , " who then met with lawmakers wednesday , he said			2
" unfortunately , the @entity3 was unable or unwilling to answer even the most basic questions			1
" @entity23 slammed the subcommittee 's move , though some acknowledged the @entity3 could be more forthcoming with information in the case			1
veteran rep. @entity49 , @entity50 , said after the vote : " i 've never seen a procedure quite like this			0
" " we are protesting here a sweeping subpoena , " he said			0
since @entity20 have " been able to find nothing " wrong in what they 've looked at so far , they have " increased the size of the net and reduced the size of the holes in the net as they go about this fishing expedition			0
" the @entity3 accused the @entity3 panel of choosing " a partisan route			1
" " this administration has cooperated extensively with the committee 's investigation by producing over 85,000 pages of documents , including 20,000 pages produced just yesterday afternoon , " @entity3 spokesman @entity68 said in a statement			2
" administration officials have participated in multiple briefings and hearings , and the @entity3 has also already provided over 900 pages of documents in response to requests we have received			2
and all of the materials that have been disclosed affirm what we said on day one : this was a merit - based decision made by the @entity89			0
" @entity90 called the subpoenas " unprecedented and unwarranted			2
" federal analysts looking at the proposed @entity6 loan in 2009 warned then of possible problems , as well as pressure from the @entity3 to speed up a decision , according to a memorandum released last month by congressional investigators			1
approved in may 2010 , the @entity89 's loan allowed @entity6 to build a factory in @entity101 , @entity102 , to produce state - of - the - art solar panels			1
@entity6 filed for bankruptcy in late august and closed its doors , however , putting more than 1,000 people out of work after it received $ 535 million in loan guarantees			1
the bankruptcy leaves the federal government unlikely to get the loan money back			0
president @entity22 touted the company in a widely publicized visit last year			0
a source familiar with the congressional investigation said the @entity3 has provided e-mail communications with details about who at the @entity3 was looped in on the deal while red flags were being raised about the financial soundness of the company			0
@entity3 chief of staff @entity124 announced last week that he is ordering a 60 - day independent review of the state of the @entity89 's loan portfolio			2
the review will include recommendations about how to improve the loan monitoring process			0
the review will be headed by @entity132 , a veteran of both the @entity22 and last @entity134 administrations who oversaw the @entity136 ( @entity136 ) , among other things			0
@entity1 's @entity138 , @entity139 , @entity140 and @entity141 contributed to this report .			0
