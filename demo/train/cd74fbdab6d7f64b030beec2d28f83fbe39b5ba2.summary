-- " what # are you at ? " the brief e-mail arrived late on the morning of january 24			1
i keep looking at it			2
we first became friends more than 25 years ago			2
we got together as often as we could when we found ourselves in the same town , usually for long , laughter - filled dinners ; @entity6 , a columnist for the @entity11 , in recent years became the author of multiple big bestselling books , most of them on inspirational themes			1
" what # are you at ? " he was going to be making appearances for his latest book , " @entity20 , " and he had looked at his schedule and saw that he had a few days between speeches in the @entity23			2
he knew that i 'd been holed up in a hotel on the west coast of @entity27 , trying to get some writing done			2
he was going to take those two days between speeches to join me and just hang out			0
so we talked on the phone , and arranged the days			0
today -- sunday , march 4 -- is the day he was to arrive			1
on february 10 , on his way back to his home in suburban @entity35 from a book signing in @entity37 , @entity38 , the night before , @entity6 was killed instantly when , according to police , his car skidded on a snowy road and was hit head - on by an oncoming semitrailer truck			1
@entity6 's wife , @entity44 , his three daughters , @entity46 , @entity47 and @entity48 , and his parents , @entity50 and @entity51 , have suffered an unfathomable loss			1
the obituaries and tributes written by his friends and colleagues have all centered on @entity6 's never - ending thoughtfulness and compassion			1
the tributes have been entirely accurate ; the constancy of @entity6 's kindness was one of life 's rarities			1
today , when @entity6 should have been arriving for our time together , i 'd like to pass on a lesson from him that i believe can be used to great effect by anyone , regardless of his or her line of work			1
it has to do with the book that first made him a bestselling author , " @entity74 , " written with professor @entity76 of @entity77			0
the book was a publishing phenomenon : 5 million copies sold in the @entity82 language alone , translations into 48 languages around the world			0
some people thought that @entity6 got lucky with that book			1
but luck had nothing to do with it			0
in early september 2007 , @entity6 was working on a @entity11 column about a trend he was hearing about at @entity93 universities			1
professors were thinking what they might say if they had to deliver one last lecture , and were in fact giving those lectures , summing up what had been meaningful in their lives			0
as he was reporting the piece , @entity6 learned that a professor at @entity77 -- @entity76 -- was going to give what might literally be his last lecture			1
@entity76 was dying from pancreatic cancer			0
it was going to be inconvenient for @entity6 to go from @entity35 to @entity107 for the speech ; there was a problem with the price of the flight , and the schedule , and he also had obligations to attend to in @entity38 that day			1
it would have been much easier just to call the professor and get a quote , or have the university send him an audio or video recording of the lecture			0
remember : @entity6 did n't even know , at that point , whether @entity76 's lecture would warrant a whole column			1
but he got up that morning in @entity35 and -- @entity6 being @entity6 -- decided that he really ought to see for himself			1
he was an established and respected @entity11 staff member ; no one at the paper would have faulted him for doing a quick interview with @entity76 on the phone			0
@entity6 got in his car and drove more than 300 miles from @entity35 to @entity107 to sit in the audience and listen to the speech			1
a five - hour drive there , and then a five - hour , 300 - mile drive back			0
it paid off spectacularly , of course			0
the column -- moving , tender , insightful -- was a sensation , and the book that he ended up writing with @entity76 gave @entity6 a new career in the top echelon of @entity93 authors , and provided financial security for his family			1
but -- and this is what is important -- it was nothing he did n't do all the time			1
in his work , he always went the extra step -- the extra hundred steps			1
he never took the easy way			0
i remember , seven or eight years ago , well before " @entity74 , " @entity6 had come to @entity154 to interview an old - time vaudeville performer			1
to the best of my recollection , the newspaper story was going to have something to do with audiences , or audience reactions			2
the old performer was going to be one sliver of a longer piece			0
an easy phone - call interview			0
but @entity6 did n't do things that way			1
he flew to @entity154 and , suitcase in hand ( he had n't checked into his hotel yet ) , met me at the restaurant where we had arranged to have dinner			0
at one point we talked about why , at this stage in his career , he still pushed himself so hard			0
he said he just wanted to look into the man 's eyes when he interviewed him the next day			2
he felt the story would be a little better that way			2
at the end of the meal we went to the coat - check window ; they had taken @entity6 's suitcase down a long flight of stairs to store it on a basement level			1
@entity6 did n't want the young woman to have to carry it up the stairs , so he went down to get it			1
i stood there and watched as he came up the steep flight of stairs , visibly weary , huffing , sweating , lugging the heavy bag ; we looked at each other and both of us burst out laughing			0
" look at you , " i said			0
" you look like ' death of a [ cuss - word - adjective ] salesman			2
' " " i know , " he said			0
" why do i do this ? " we both knew the answer			0
he did it because it was the right way to do a job			0
and it does n't matter what a person does for a living			0
it can be the lawyer who stays late to look up a few more citations of case law , to give his client the best possible chance			0
it can be the teacher who goes over the lesson plan one more time , adding something vital to it at midnight , even though the students or the school administrators will never be aware of the effort she has put in			2
it can be the factory worker who takes it upon himself to check the specifications a third and fourth time , wanting to be absolutely certain that the product will be as close to perfect as humanly possible			0
does it always pay off , as @entity6 's 10 hours on the road paid off with " @entity74 " ? of course not			1
it hardly ever pays off that big			0
most times , your boss , your colleagues , your own family will never know that you put in the extra effort when you did n't have to			2
and when the day finally comes when you have your big success , when you get your big break , it wo n't be because you made the extra effort once			2
it will be because you made the extra effort every time			2
and that 's the lesson i 'd like to pass on for him			1
the silence at the dinner hour tonight is going to be awfully loud			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity259 .			1

@entity259 says he heard from friend , @entity6 , 2 weeks before his death in a car crash
he says writer @entity6 's *integrity* , both personal and professional , was inspiring
he once drove hundreds of miles for a story that he easily could have " phoned in "
@entity259 : over and over in his life , he took extra steps to get it right -- a lesson for us all
