-- if presidential hopeful @entity2 should awaken one night in a cold sweat with the ghost of @entity6 past hovering by his bedside , the apparition will likely take the form of sen. @entity10 , who passed away on saturday after a long struggle with @entity13 's disease			1
@entity10 's political career ended when he lost his @entity16 seat in 1984 , the same year that future @entity17 gov. @entity2 won his first election to the @entity19 as a @entity20			1
@entity10 's fall from @entity6 wunderkind to party outcast offers a vivid illustration of the @entity6 's mutation from a vibrant and diverse coalition to the dogmatic cult of conservative ideology that it has become today			1
in 1968 , political gossips buzzed about the possibility that the rich , handsome , " @entity33 " @entity10 might run for president			2
the @entity34 called him " the hottest political article in the @entity6 , " and @entity35 worried that @entity10 would be his most formidable competitor in the primaries			1
@entity10 was a moderate - to - liberal @entity6 from the @entity39 wing of the party who had made his name promoting affordable housing and combating urban poverty			1
such positions were seen as positive political attributes in 1968			0
four years earlier , @entity48 's libertarian presidential campaign had proved a disaster , and republicans were not eager to repeat the experience			0
but @entity10 chose not to run and instead endorsed his colleague @entity39 , who lost to @entity35			1
over the next few years , @entity10 clashed frequently with @entity35 over defense spending and @entity54 appointments			1
during the @entity55 , he again defied @entity35 by demanding an independent investigation			2
with his popularity and national name - recognition peaking , @entity10 might have had another shot at the presidency in 1976 , but he deferred to the incumbent , @entity61			2
there would not be another chance , for the @entity6 was moving away from @entity10			1
in the mid- 1970s , a group of conservative insurgents known as the @entity66 began plotting to extinguish the party 's liberal wing			2
they despised men such as @entity10 and embraced a fanatical brand of social conservatism			2
one of their leaders , @entity75 , founded the @entity76 and recruited @entity77 to lead the @entity78			0
one by one , the @entity66 knocked off the liberal @entity6 , either by defeating them in primaries or fatally weakening them in general elections -- names now barely remembered such as @entity82 of @entity83 or @entity84 of @entity85			1
in 1984 , @entity66 leaders backed a primary challenge against @entity10			0
when that failed , they endorsed his @entity90 challenger , the liberal , bow - tie wearing @entity92			0
one of the leaders , @entity94 , explained that @entity10 's defeat was more important to conservatives than retaining @entity6 control of the @entity16			1
when the voting was over , the @entity6 kept the @entity16 , but they lost @entity10			1
the drive for ideological purity has continued ever since , with tea party groups and fundraisers such as the @entity103 targeting moderate conservatives after the liberals went extinct			0
in recent years , they helped force out @entity106 of @entity107 , @entity108 of @entity109 and @entity110 of @entity111			0
@entity2 , the front - runner of the @entity6 presidential field in polls , is a deep social and fiscal conservative who would never have had a shot at the presidential nomination in 1968			1
but in 2012 , it 's the liberal @entity10 who would n't have stood a chance			2
even @entity48 's refusal to embrace the religious right would doom his candidacy were he to run today			0
yet perhaps @entity2 would still be wise to pay attention to the ghost of @entity127			0
he might get to see the old @entity90 advertisement showing a disembodied pair of hands ripping apart a social security card			0
that advertisement helped turn the tide against @entity48 , who like @entity2 had challenged @entity133			0
conservative activists have succeeded in driving @entity136 politics far to the right , but there may still be limits			0
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity142 .			0

@entity142 : in 1968 , @entity10 was a rising @entity6 star who fought urban poverty , @entity35
@entity146 *toppled* @entity10 and other liberal @entity6 , he writes
@entity142 : @entity10 's career shows how a diverse @entity6 became lock - *stepped* in ideology
