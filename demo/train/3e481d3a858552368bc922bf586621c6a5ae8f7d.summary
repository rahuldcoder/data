@entity0 insisted sunday that the former @entity2 players who went to @entity3 for a basketball diplomacy trip , led by @entity5 , were n't paid by the repressive regime			1
i think i am astute enough to understand the dynamics , especially collecting monetary dollars from @entity3			2
no , we did not get paid from @entity3 at all , " he told @entity11 in a lengthy exclusive interview on " new day sunday			1
" @entity0 , who retired from the @entity2 in 1997 after nine seasons , said an @entity16 online betting company and a documentary film crew paid expenses for the ex-players turned hoops ambassadors			2
last month the @entity16 company , @entity21 , said it had removed its name from @entity5 's project after the execution of @entity26 's uncle and top aide , @entity28			1
but it said it would honor its " contractual commitments " to the team			0
speaking by satellite from @entity32 , @entity0 said it was n't about the money			1
he saw it as an opportunity to go to a reclusive country and exchange cultural information with other athletes and citizens			0
but he did n't see it as a birthday present for @entity3 leader @entity42			1
" that 's the date that was set			2
i did n't know it was his birthday , " he said in the half - hour interview			1
" and it did n't matter to me once i found out that it was his birthday			2
" @entity0 said he felt for @entity5 , who asked for his help organizing the trip and who really seemed to want to pull off a big event			1
" i saw the pressure mount			0
i saw him change , and it was very difficult keeping him and everyone together ( once controversy began over traveling to @entity3 ) , " he said			2
@entity5 arrived at @entity32 airport on a flight from @entity62 on monday morning , the last of the team 's players to leave @entity3			1
the players ' trip also met with criticism because @entity3 still holds @entity68 , a @entity69 citizen who was arrested in november 2012 , convicted last spring by @entity70 of " hostile acts " intended to topple the government , and sentenced to 15 years in a labor camp			1
some questioned whether the players would advocate for his release , but they did n't -- at least not publicly			2
" we did n't go there for that			0
we went there to do what we normally do , and that 's to be cross-cultural ambassadors and use the game of basketball as a bridge for exchange , " he said			2
@entity0 said the difference between this trip and other sports exchanges was that the players were n't sent as representatives of the @entity69			1
" we 're athletes doing it ourselves , " he said			0
when celebrity meets brutality @entity0 said he has no regrets about going			2
he said he was able to meet some @entity3 citizens and even came across one man who winced before shaking the hand of the first @entity100 he had ever met			0
@entity0 said the man told him they did n't have a very good view of @entity100			1
the man rubbed his hand as if the color would come off , @entity0 said			0
@entity5 appears to bow , sings ' @entity107 ' to @entity3 's @entity26 " then the next day after we talked for a while , he came up to me and said he was sorry , " @entity0 said			1
the former @entity2 player , who now travels frequently as a basketball ambassador , said he did n't go to any areas where people are hungry			0
@entity0 also swapped sports stories with @entity3 's sports minister and basketball players from the national team			1
he thinks that will be a positive outcome from the trip			0
" we accomplished a relationship on the sports side in @entity3 , " he said			0
" where it goes from there , i do not know at this point in time			0
but we established a relationship			0
they 've asked us to come back			0
whether we go back or not , i 'm not sure			0
but there was a relationship established between a group of individuals in two different countries that do n't communicate			0
" @entity5 apologizes for @entity3 outburst , says he 'd been drinking			1
