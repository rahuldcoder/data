the group 's @entity6 stands at 71.5 % , compared to a revised index last year of 72.1 % , the league said as it released its annual report , called @entity10			1
an equality index of less than 100 % suggests blacks are doing worse relative to whites , while an index greater than 100 % suggests blacks are doing better			1
the league attributed the 2011 drop to a decline in the economics index , driven by housing and wealth factors , and to a decline in the health index , driven by children 's health			1
@entity27 and social justice continue to be the areas in which blacks trail whites the most , with ratings of 56.9 % and 58 % respectively			2
those are followed by health at 75 % and education at 78.9 %			0
since the @entity6 was introduced in 2005 , researchers have found growing equality between blacks and whites in the unemployment rate , the percentage of uninsured , the incarceration rate , and prisoners as a percentage of arrests , the league said			0
the index has also charted growing inequality over that period in rates of poverty , home ownership , school enrollment ( both " preprimary " and college ) , and the level of educational attainment ( both high school diplomas and bachelor 's degrees )			2
the index of median household income has remained unchanged , the league said			0
in 2010 , the index measured @entity64 in @entity65 for the first time			2
this year 's index finds them faring slightly better than last year compared to their white counterparts , at 76.8 % compared to a revised 2010 index of 76.6 % , the league said			1
it attributed the rise to improvements in health and social justice indices , but said those were offset by declines in economics and education			0
in the past year , the league said it has observed growing gaps in the relative status of blacks and whites in the areas of loan access , wealth and children 's health			1
for @entity64 , there have been growing gaps in the areas of loan access and college enrollment , it said			0
