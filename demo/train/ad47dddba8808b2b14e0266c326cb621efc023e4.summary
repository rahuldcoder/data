-- @entity1 is a land of memory			2
after all , it 's the capital of a commonwealth , not just a state , evoking the colonial era			2
and when it comes to baseball , well , how many times have we heard the yarn about how the antique @entity13 endured nearly a century of pain without a @entity16 championship ? now the @entity17 have won their third title in nine years -- at @entity13 , no less -- but this victory seems to hold deeper meaning than just winning a sporting crown			1
it 's being compared to a divine balm to heal one of the darkest recent memories in @entity26 : the terror bombings at the @entity28 last april			1
on saturday morning , a victory parade will make a symbolic gesture to confirm the restoration of a great city : the procession will cross over the marathon 's finish line -- still marked on the street -- where the explosions occurred			1
the parade will follow the same route used to celebrate the team 's championship in 2004 , when it broke the streak for not winning a @entity16 , the team said			1
the team 's last championship was in 2007			1
" it lifts the spirit back up after the marathon , " one woman told @entity0 in @entity1 during a post-game street celebration this week so loud that it was n't possible to get her name			2
" they obviously deserve it			0
i feel like i knew it was going to happen			0
" 5 things you need to know about the @entity16 many mused about the supernatural being at work			0
" first the @entity60 and now the @entity16 ... , " said @entity61 on the @entity62 , " it was given to you			0
" it was as if @entity1 rose again after a trial of the spirit			0
" this was not just about winning a championship			0
it was about a group of regular guys that believed in themselves and this city , and this country , and through their unbelievable efforts it helped relieve the pain of the @entity60 in april , " wrote @entity68 on the same social media page			2
" they dedicated their season to the victims and the entire country embraced them , and they embraced @entity1 and the entire country			0
what we witnessed was a real life movie in the making and for me this was more than just sports			0
more championships will be won every year but the story of the 2013 @entity17 will never be repeated			1
" fans like @entity68 also repeated all or part of slogan that has since become a mantra in the marathon tragedy 's aftermath : " @entity98 617			1
" the terror explosions disturbed the nation because they occurred in such a public place : the attacks killed three people , wounded more than 260 others , and put the city in a five - day lockdown until a manhunt finally captured the sole surviving terror suspect			1
" this @entity16 was so much more than just a baseball game for the city of @entity1 , " @entity109 wrote on the team 's @entity111 page			1
then , signing off in a shorthand of the digital era , he wrote : " @entity117			0
" immediately after the victory , some fans ran to @entity120 , where the finish line of the @entity28 is still painted on the street			1
the april bombings occurred near this line -- which still says " finish " -- and fans kneeled and kissed it			1
@entity127 , 7 , @entity1 bombing survivor , sings anthem at @entity17 game wednesday 's win over the @entity131 also marked the first time that the @entity17 won a championship while at home since 1918 -- the year that began the team 's infamous 86 - year @entity16 drought			1
mysticism was behind that punishment , fans cried			0
it was the @entity142 -- the hex imposed on the team because it sold legendary player @entity145 to the @entity146 in 1920			2
indeed , 97 - year - old @entity147 of @entity1 was 2 years old when the team won that 1918 championship at home			1
" i never thought i 'd live to see this , " she said of the 2013 championship			1
no story on the @entity17 would be complete without interviewing a bostonian with such a long memory like @entity147 's			1
she now lives in a nursing home , still peppy enough to talk with reporters			2
" i would go down and see the @entity17 a lot , " @entity147 said of her childhood years at @entity13			0
back then , a hot dog cost 15 cents , she said			0
opinion : i 'm a @entity17 fanboy she explained the enthusiasm of fans			0
" they 're a great team , " she said			2
" i do n't think as good as they were in @entity169 ' time , but i think they 're doing a great job and i 'm rooting for them all the time			0
" batting legend @entity169 played for the @entity17 from 1939 to 1960			0
this year 's team was also noteworthy for how players cultivated beards out of a superstition since spring training : the team kept winning as more players grew one , despite early predictions that this would n't their season			1
the season indeed ended as theirs			0
but one fan on @entity111 now wonders : " now can they shave ? " @entity189 said .			2

new : saturday 's victory parade for team will pass site of the marathon 's april bombings
the long memory of @entity198 easily reaches 1918 , when their team last won a title at home
the more recent memory of the @entity28 attacks is painful
a 97 - year - old fan *savors* this year 's victory : " i never thought i 'd live to see this "
