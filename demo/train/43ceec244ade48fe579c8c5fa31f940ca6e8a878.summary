millions of " @entity1 " viewers were shocked sunday night when one of the show 's main characters , lady @entity2 , died from eclampsia shortly after delivering a daughter			1
" although the fictional tv series represents life in the early 1900s , women in the @entity11 and elsewhere still die or suffer terrible outcomes from the hypertensive disorders of pregnancy , " including preeclampsia and eclampsia , the @entity7 said in a statement issued after the show aired sunday night			1
here , five things you should know about preeclampsia and eclampsia : 1			1
@entity22 is a serious complication of preeclampsia			2
it 's characterized by one or more seizures during pregnancy or in the postpartum period			2
" in the developed world , eclampsia is rare and usually treatable if appropriate intervention is promptly sought , " according to the @entity7			2
left untreated , however , the seizures can result in coma , brain damage and potentially in maternal or infant death			0
preeclampsia is typically treated with magnesium sulfate , as it has been proven to be extremely effective at preventing eclampsia from occurring , said dr. @entity38 , a member of the foundation 's medical board and immediate past president of the @entity42			1
" we see most eclampsia now after delivery ( in the @entity11 ) , " @entity38 said , " because we use medications to prevent it during labor and delivery			1
" previously , as seen on " @entity1 , " " the highest - risk time was at the end of pushing efforts for vaginal delivery , " he said			1
" the way i teach it ... is eclampsia really is preeclampsia affecting the brain , " he said			1
preeclampsia can also affect the liver -- a condition known as hellp syndrome -- or the kidneys , @entity38 said			2
@entity64 typically appears after the 20th week of pregnancy			0
it most frequently is seen during the third trimester			0
it 's characterized by a large rise in blood pressure and failing kidneys			0
doctors monitor an expectant mother 's blood pressure as well as check for excessive protein in her urine			0
" it 's considered to be a complication of the second half of pregnancy and after delivery , " @entity38 said			2
@entity64 was initially thought to be a disorder preceding eclampsia , hence its name , according to the foundation			2
doctors used to believe eclampsia was a progression of preeclampsia , but seizures can occur all of a sudden in women who previously have not shown signs of preeclampsia , he said			1
@entity64 , along with other hypertensive disorders of pregnancy such as @entity98 syndrome , impact about 5 to 8 % of births in the @entity11 , according to the foundation			0
the condition underscores the need for prenatal care , @entity38 said			0
" there are supposedly 50,000 deaths in the world due to eclampsia , " most of them in developing countries where prenatal care is not widely available , he said			2
@entity64 is more likely to occur during the first pregnancy			0
risk factors for preeclampsia include multiple gestation ( pregnant with more than one baby ) ; a history of chronic high blood pressure , diabetes , kidney disease or organ transplant ; a family history of preeclampsia ; maternal age and obesity , particularly with a body mass index over 30			1
" it 's still correctly described as a disease of the age extremes , " most often seen in pregnant teenagers or pregnant women in their late 30s and 40s , @entity38 said			1
however , women who did not have preeclampsia in their first pregnancy should not believe they 're in the clear , he said			1
@entity98 syndrome , for instance , is more common in later pregnancies			0
the cause of preeclampsia is unknown			0
however , there is " general agreement that the placenta plays a key role in preeclampsia , and women with chronic hypertension and certain metabolic diseases like diabetes are more susceptible , " according to the @entity7			1
" pregnancy causes it , but beyond that , the specific problem between the fetus and mother , and the genes from the father and so forth ... is not completely clear , " @entity38 said			0
women with preeclampsia are more likely to have complications such as low birthweight , premature birth or placental abruption , where the placenta separates from the wall of the uterus before birth , according to the @entity163			1
" often , women who have preeclampsia do not feel sick , " according to the @entity167			1
@entity38 said often , he has to convince women to come in and be evaluated as they do not feel ill. " it 's such a gradual , insidious onset , they do n't realize they 're hypertensive or getting sick			1
" symptoms can include , but are n't limited to : -- swelling of the hands and face , or edema			0
note some swelling is considered normal during pregnancy , @entity38 said , but doctors specifically look for swelling in the face and behind the eyes			0
-- sudden weight gain over one to two days -- more than 2 pounds a week in severe cases : -- headache that does not go away -- abdominal pain on the right side , below the ribs , or also in the right shoulder -- nausea and vomiting -- vision changes : temporary blindness , seeing flashing lights or spots , sensitivity to light , blurry vision 5			0
the only " cure " for preeclampsia is delivery			2
if preeclampsia is diagnosed before a baby is considered " term , " or 37 weeks , bed rest , medication or even hospitalization may be required , according to the @entity7			0
eclampsia cases before delivery can be treated with steroids , @entity38 said			1
most cases of postpartum preeclampsia develop within 48 hours of childbirth , but may develop four to six weeks postpartum , according to the @entity208			1
delivery begins the cure , @entity38 said , as tissue is left behind after the placenta is removed and is shed by a new mother in the days following the birth			0
" while obviously not dangerous for the baby , postpartum preeclampsia is still critical for the mother , " according to the @entity7			2
" nearly 80 % of women who die from preeclampsia die postpartum			1
sleep deprivation , postpartum depression , more attention on the newborn and a lack of familiarity with normal postpartum experiences all contribute to more easily ignoring or missing indicators of a problem			0
" " they 're focused on the baby , " @entity38 said			0
" they expect to have some headaches and not feel great , " but do n't realize severe headaches can indicate a problem .			0

a character on " @entity1 " dies from eclampsia after childbirth
preeclampsia and eclampsia still poses a *threat* to pregnant women
both conditions can be treated
the risk does n't go away after delivery , as postpartum cases are seen
