-- a handwriting expert testifying for the defense said wednesday that former @entity4 police officer @entity3 did not forge a suicide note for his wife , @entity6 , whose body was found inside the couple 's burning home in 2011			1
but in a possible blow to the defense , @entity10 conceded in cross-examination that she is not currently certified by any forensic document examination organizations			1
@entity3 is on trial for first - degree murder in @entity18 's death			1
prosecutors say @entity18 shot his wife and set fire to their home			1
the defense says it was @entity18 who pulled the trigger after starting the fire			2
@entity3 told investigators that his wife was depressed			1
the alleged suicide note asks @entity3 to take care of their two boys : " hold them both and tell them ' mommy loves them ' every night			1
" did @entity4 cop kill wife , burn down their home ? it ends with a message to the children , telling them , " i love the two of you and will be watching over you from @entity45			2
" a prosecution expert earlier had testified that the note had not been written by @entity48			2
but @entity10 testified she concluded that the handwriting in the note matched the handwriting of the person who wrote in @entity48 's journals			2
the prosecution was able to score a point during cross-examination , however , by getting @entity10 to admit she is not currently certified and is semi-retired			2
prosecutors also displayed a board with another sample of @entity48 's writing alongside the suicide note			1
the expert admitted there are discrepancies between the two			0
jurors got to take a closer look at the two samples on handouts provided by the prosecution			0
@entity0 's @entity70 said they seemed to be nodding in agreement that the samples had differences			0
one of @entity3 's co-workers testified earlier in the trial that @entity18 had asked for an overhead projector the day before his wife 's death			1
the prosecution suggested in opening statements that @entity18 used the projector to forge the suicide note			1
@entity18 has said he was sleeping downstairs on the night of the fire , @entity0 affiliate @entity84 reported			0
he heard a noise , and moments later his wife called him on his cell phone , saying he should get their two boys before they got hurt			0
he then purportedly heard two pops			0
@entity3 went upstairs and saw flames			2
he reportedly said he found his wife in their bedroom and tried to save her			0
but prosecutors say @entity3 's story does n't makes sense			1
for one , he had no soot or blood on him , they say , according to @entity84 , and only a small burn on his foot			0
he and the couple 's sons escaped from the blaze unharmed			0
the @entity109 ' home in @entity110 , @entity4 , sits not far from the courthouse where @entity3 is standing trial			1
despite extensive fire damage , the house still stands ; a brick chimney pokes out of the charred remains			0
" i 'm smart enough that if i wanted to kill my wife ... i could 've come up with something better than this , " @entity18 told investigators about the shooting and the fire			0
" this is what a crazy person does			0

@entity3 is on trial for murder , *accused* of killing his wife , @entity6
a defense expert testifies he did not forge her suicide note
in cross-examination , the expert tells prosecutors she is no longer certified in her field
