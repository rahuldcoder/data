" " ... since assuming power in february , the @entity48 has repeatedly pledged to break the cycle of repression entrenched over the past 30 years			0
in reality , however , it has resorted to familiar patterns of abuse			0
" a recent endorsement in full of @entity3 's emergency law and its expansion , after it was restricted last year under @entity30 , is considered the largest example of human rights violation , the organization said			0
however , it alleged demonstrations have been violently dispersed and protesters have been arrested , detained and tortured " before being tried unfairly before military courts and convicted			1
