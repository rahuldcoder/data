editor 's note : upwave is @entity3 's new lifestyle brand designed to entertain the health into you ! visit upwave.com for more information and follow upwave on @entity8 , @entity9 , @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 @ upwaveofficial			2
( upwave.com ) -- remember when @entity14 used to promise us kids a special certificate from school if we did 100 push - ups in a row during gym ? well , it 's not all jumping jacks and gray sweatpants these days -- but you still got ta move if you want to feel good			1
how much , you say ? according to @entity27 , today 's national fitness program , kids should get a total of 60 minutes of physical activity each day , and adults need 30			1
here 's why it matters , especially for the kids : childhood obesity rates have tripled since the ' 80s , and at this rate , one third of all children born in 2000 or later will suffer from diabetes at some point in their lives			1
and let 's not mention heart disease , asthma and tons of other largely preventable weight - related ailments			2
besides , exercise just feels good -- and do n't you think most family outings could use a bit more of that ? so ditch the minivan and the trip to @entity54 and head outside ! believe it or not , your kids will thank you : endorphins plus fresh air and a fun family experience equals a refreshing way to get in better shape -- and you do n't need to chase over-caffeinated children all over a noisy pizza arcade to do it			1
and with that said , here are six ways to move it , shake it and make exercise packed with family fun : upwave : 7 reasons to sweat outdoors ( you 'll thank us ) walk the walk			1
if your crew usually heads to the couch after dinner , make them save their favorite show to the dvr and take a walk instead			1
not long , not far , but make sure you get outside and let your meal digest while you stroll			1
if you 're in a city , walk around the block ; suburban dwellers can make tracks around the cul - de - sac			1
the point is simple : fresh air and a few steps together			1
what you need : comfy shoes for sure			2
if it makes life fun , bring bikes , @entity102 scooters , roller skates and the dog , too -- anything that brings a smile to your party on the go			1
stop begging the kids to put away the video games ... and play with them instead ! fire up the @entity112 and compete with classics like " @entity114 , " or bust a move with " @entity116			1
" families with wee ones will love " @entity119 " and " @entity120			1
" even " @entity123 " will get you up and out of your seat , which is the whole idea			0
more into watching plain ol ' tv ? make it a goal ( or competition ) to jump up during commercials ; whoever gets up first -- and stays on his or her feet for the duration of the commercial break -- wins			1
upwave : stop sitting , it 's really bad for you admittedly , a @entity112 is an investment , but if you 're game ( see what we did there ? ) , it 's easy to find refurbished models for less than half the price of the latest and greatest			0
during the fall , there 's nothing like an adventure in the great outdoors			0
@entity149 recently touted the @entity150 at @entity151 in @entity152 as one of the best family - friendly hikes in the @entity155 they called it a " mini-adventure through flower - filled meadows " and " a great way to introduce kids to the beauty of the high country			1
" whether you 're trekking in snow - capped mountains or at your local state park , it 's hard to beat the call of the wild -- even if you 're doing it with a @entity170			1
speaking of which , if you 're hiking with small children , you 'll need an aluminum - framed baby backpack ; look for one with a sun visor , water bottle pocket and a design that allows you to set the pack down with the child still sitting inside			2
bring a bandana that you can soak in water for quick cool downs , plus some dried fruit to nosh on			0
( it 's the single best snack to bring on hikes , because it wo n't melt or turn to dust if someone accidentally crushes the pack with his hiking boot			2
) upwave : how to hike with a baby strike a pose			0
if the wilds are n't for you , stay inside and stretch			2
family yoga is huge now -- and that means your options are , too			2
many studios offer family workouts , including partner poses and group discounts			0
you can get your @entity201 on at home , too : there are kid - friendly cards with adorably illustrated yoga poses , illustrated books for kids and of course dvds on yoga for families designed to guide your group through @entity213 , too			1
all you 'll need is loose , stretchable clothing and a mat ( a folded beach towel will work )			0
if you do yoga at home , do n't get hung up on whether the kids are doing the moves right , or even doing all of them at all			1
let them imitate you the way they want to			0
chances are you 'll be amazed at their flexibility			0
upwave : does stretching really do anything ? run through the mud			0
mud runs are everywhere -- you know , runs where you slip on a costume and slide through miles of muddy terrain ? many of them are also open to families			1
a single online search for " family mud run " resulted in pages of events happening all over the country this year			0
moms and dads are running the @entity243 in @entity244 , @entity245 , where " features built by diabolical minds ( are ) ready to test you and your mud - running skills			0
" and families are getting dirty for charity in @entity253 : the @entity254 takes place on a 250 - acre campus that includes a sandpit crawl , cargo - net climb , @entity259 and of course a mud pit			2
if your family and your washing machine can take it , sign up for something near you now			0
just make sure both are things you do n't mind getting dirty			1
skip the sports drinks but do bring water bottles			0
consider having a family t - shirt or team bottles made up			0
bring a fresh set of clothes ( including shoes ) for everyone , along with a plastic bag to store the dirties in for the ride home			2
upwave : 5 mud runs not to miss hit the surf			0
imagine yourself on a surfboard , ripping through the waves under a tropical sun. now picture your kids splashing and smiling on their boards all the way to the shore			2
truth ? surfing is wicked hard			0
but it 's also a total adventure , and one that 's now catering to families			2
and you do n't have to head to @entity301 to do it ( though you certainly could ) : family surfing packages are popping up all over , from @entity304 to the more local shores of @entity306 and @entity307			1
packages include room , board and some of the best instructors around ( see " wicked hard " above )			0
word to the wise : spring for a rash - guard shirt and the thickest spf you can find			0
then just hang loose like it 's 1989 , duuude			0
