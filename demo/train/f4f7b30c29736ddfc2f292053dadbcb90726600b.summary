after three days of poring over photos and video , investigators appealed to the public to help them identify two men now considered suspects in the @entity7 bombings			1
the men were photographed walking down @entity9 , one behind the other , near the finish line of monday 's race			1
suspect 1 was seen wearing a light - colored , collarless shirt underneath a dark - colored jacket and wearing a dark baseball cap			2
the man identified as @entity18 was seen setting down a backpack at the site of the second explosion " within minutes " of the blasts that killed three people and wounded nearly 180 , said special agent @entity24 , the head of the @entity27 's @entity26 office			1
he was wearing a light - colored hooded sweatshirt , a black jacket and a white baseball cap turned backward			2
in particular , @entity24 asked for help from anyone standing in front of the @entity34 , where the second bombing happened			2
" somebody out there knows these individuals as friends , neighbors , co-workers or family members of the suspects , " @entity36 said			2
" and though it may be difficult , the nation is counting on those with information to come forward and provide it to us			2
" people with possible information on the two men were urged to go to the @entity27 's website , https://bostonmarathontips.fbi.gov , or call 800 - call - @entity27 ( 800 - 225 - 5324 )			1
by thursday evening , authorities already had received a " large volume of calls ... as a result of the photos , " an @entity27 official said			1
the @entity27 's website , moreover , had been inundated with record traffic			1
it was n't immediately known then whether any of the tips had led to the suspects			2
@entity63 cautioned that anyone who think they know their identities should be careful , and consider them armed and " extremely dangerous			2
" " no one should approach them , " he said			2
" no one should attempt to apprehend them except law enforcement			2
" ' they acted differently than everyone else ' other footage , still unreleased , shows that the two suspects stayed at the scene to watch the carnage unfold , a federal law enforcement official with knowledge of the investigation told @entity82 's @entity81			1
" when the bombs blow up , when most people are running away and victims were lying on the ground , the two suspects walk away pretty casually , " said the official , who has seen the unreleased video			1
" they acted differently than everyone else			0
" while video of at least one suspect planting the bomb exists , the @entity27 had chosen not to release it , according to the official			1
one reason , according to the official , is that were the media to repeatedly show the suspects leaving the bomb , it might cause some people to overreact if they came into contact with them			1

" the official who spoke with @entity82 said images of the second suspect were isolated wednesday			2

in the early hours of the investigation , a law enforcement official told @entity82 that the bombs were probably detonated by timers			2
the @entity27 has said details of the detonating system were unknown			1
while the latest clues moved the investigation forward , it is still unclear whether the attack was an act of domestic or foreign terrorism			0
bombers ' picked the wrong city , ' @entity140 says thursday evening 's @entity27 announcement capped a day in which president @entity140 brought a mixture of reassurance and defiance to an interfaith memorial service in the city 's @entity149			1
whoever planted the bombs " picked the wrong city " to attack , he said			0
" every one of us stands with you , " @entity140 told the crowd			1
" @entity26 may be your hometown -- but we claim it , too			1

" i think it 's incredibly inspiring that he would take time out and visit them and have a sincere interaction with all of these folks that have been hurt			0
" @entity140 " was humbled by the patients ' bravery and their fortitude and their drive to continue , " he added			1
