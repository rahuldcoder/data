-- @entity1 by @entity2 you 'd have to call 2005 a very tough year for @entity2 and his family : after barely escaping a tsunami while vacationing in @entity7 , they returned home to @entity9 to witness the death of @entity2 's partner 's sister			1
while @entity1 ( @entity13 ) might have been just another " why me ? " memoir , it is , in the @entity19 novelist and biographer 's hands , a wise study of the roots and rewards of altruism			1
with clear - eyed reporting , never - treacly compassion , and , yes , a healthy dose of @entity19 philosophizing , @entity2 shows us how even the most self - obsessed can find grace and joy in the simplest acts of kindness			1
@entity0 : the latest award winners : how many have you read ? @entity34 by @entity35 the @entity36 ( @entity37 ) is a " temporary enchantment ... people behave here in ways they never would back in @entity42 and @entity43 and @entity44			1
" maybe , but the problems that beset @entity48 's @entity47 family in @entity35 's affecting novel are all too common : teenage daughter @entity50 has run away from home ; 20 - something son @entity52 has just shown up with a pregnant girlfriend , demanding money ; parents @entity55 , a pastry chef , and @entity58 , a real estate attorney , are facing their own marital and financial problems			1
while the beautiful , haunted @entity50 is the heart of this novel -- and her scenes in tattoo parlors , bars , and beaches the most compelling -- @entity67 makes us wonder about more than what will happen to one girl with a guilty secret			0
what , after all , does it mean to be a family ? is love really " exchangeable , malleable " ? we ca n't help turning pages full of stunning prose to find out			1
@entity0 : 5 books everyone should read at least once mr. @entity79 by @entity80 in a make - believe world of talking animals and courtly love , you might expect a dastardly plot or two			1
but as @entity80 's vibrant novel @entity79 ( @entity87 ) makes clear , even pretend danger can be dangerous			2
" you 're a villain , " @entity91 , the literary muse of our antihero , the novelist @entity90 , tells him			0
you 're a serial killer			0
" mr. @entity79 does n't share @entity91 's outrage , however			2
" it 's ridiculous to be so sensitive about the content of fiction , " he protests			2
but @entity91 knows better , and she constructs an elaborate series of adventures to teach mr. @entity79 some lessons about his attitudes toward life and love			2
based in part on a classic @entity19 folk tale , these labyrinthine tales - within - a - tale show him -- and us -- a powerful truth : that even ideas born of our imagination matter in the real world			2
@entity0 : poetry that till get you through a hard time the arrogant years by @entity118 with precision and searing honesty , @entity118 writes in @entity121 ( @entity122 ) about her torn allegiances as both an @entity125 jew growing up in @entity126 in the 1960s and ' 70s and the youngest daughter of unhappily married parents			1
her haunting 2007 memoir , @entity131 in the @entity132 , explored the exile of her dashing father , @entity134 , who fled @entity135 as @entity136 came to power			0
here , @entity138 focuses on her mother , @entity139 , whose story is at least as tragic , whose relationship with the daughter she called @entity143 is even more complex			0
having abandoned a prestigious career ( as the private librarian to a wealthy @entity125 family ) to marry @entity134 , @entity139 becomes a passive , resentfully submissive wife			0
but after the couple and their four children are forced to resettle in @entity126 , @entity139 shows a strong will , finding a job at a @entity154 library and micromanaging @entity156 's education			1
yet @entity139 has no desire to assimilate			0
she desperately tries to hold her family together " in this @entity160 exile of ours where there were few standards and we all felt unmoored			0
" @entity156 basks in the cosseting of her parents ' immigrant community as a child , then pulls away in adolescence			0
but once successfully integrated into the secular society her parents resisted , @entity118 , a writer at the @entity170 , finds herself nostalgic for her insular childhood -- " forever yearning for that sense of absolute protection , that feeling of being watched over and loved			0
" @entity0 : books that made a difference to @entity179 the @entity180 by @entity181 in @entity126 we like our adultery straight up : a bubble of illicit passion that ends in regret			1
that 's not what @entity188 novelist @entity181 is serving in @entity190 ( @entity37 ) , which forgoes the simple morality tale for something more complex and satisfying			1
the novel begins as the otherwise involved @entity194 first sees the love of her life , the also - spoken - for @entity197			2
detailing the standard stuff of clandestine affairs -- tawdry hotels , wife - stalking -- @entity181 does not hide the ugliness of betrayal			0
but her real story is about the once illicit lovers ' fraught attempt to live as a family -- one that includes @entity197 's alarmingly strange preadolescent daughter , @entity209			0
casting aside cultural bromides about the immorality of affairs , @entity181 puts us squarely in the center of a terrible truth : love can be miraculous -- and still destroy everything in its path			1
