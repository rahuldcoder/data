@entity0 -- @entity2 approved a $ 3.4 trillion budget for the coming year wednesday , approving most of president @entity5 's key spending priorities including increasing in health care , education and alternative energy spending			1
@entity2 approved a budget plan wednesday , president @entity5 's 100th day in office			1
the spending plan passed without a single @entity13 vote in either the @entity14 or @entity15			1
the @entity15 voted for the plan 53 - 43			1
four democrats , including recent party - switcher sen. @entity18 of @entity19 , voted against it			1
earlier , the @entity14 approved the budget 233 - 193 , with 17 democrats voting against it			1
the measure passed two days after congressional @entity22 reached an agreement reconciling @entity14 and @entity15 versions of the budget package			1
" today , for the first time in many , many years , we have a president 's budget ... that is a statement of our national values , " house speaker @entity27 , @entity28 , said during the final debate on the @entity14 floor			1
" what is important to us as a nation is reflected in this budget			0
it 's a very happy day for our country			0
" republicans said the budget reflected reckless taxing and spending priorities that would leave the country in a more fiscally precarious position			0
" budgets are supposed to be about tough decisions , and there are no tough decisions in this budget , " said @entity14 minority leader @entity47 of @entity48			1
" it spends an awful lot of money , it raises a lot of taxes , and it puts all of this debt on the backs of our kids and grandkids			0
this is not the @entity66 way			0
the @entity66 way has been about a more limited government			0
" in one of the most contentious and politically polarizing decisions this year , @entity69 budget negotiators decided to fast - track a key part of the budget process			1
major health care reform is likely to pass this year because the special process , known as budget reconciliation , wo n't allow republicans to filibuster the legislation , as was widely expected			0
democrats , who control 59 seats in the @entity15 , will be able to pass it with a simple majority vote instead of the 60 needed to overcome a filibuster			2
@entity86 chairman @entity85 , @entity87 , said he did n't believe that the @entity15 would need to use reconciliation but noted that it is " there as an insurance policy			2
" sen. @entity93 , @entity94 , speaking for most of his @entity13 @entity15 colleagues , warned in the budget debate that if a health care " reconciliation winds up in the budget bill , it 'll be like a declaration of war			1
" under the @entity69 plan , the federal government will run an anticipated deficit of $ 1.2 trillion in the next fiscal year			2
their plan promises to cut the deficit by more than half by 2012			0
" it is clear that more will be needed to address the long - term fiscal imbalance confronting the nation beyond the five - year budget window , " @entity85 said			2
under the compromise plan , increases in non-defense discretionary spending are limited to 2.9 percent through 2014			2
@entity5 's signature tax cuts from the stimulus plan -- $ 400 for individuals and $ 800 for couples -- are slated to expire after 2010			1
the measure also allows former president @entity121 's tax cuts for couples who make more than $ 250,000 to expire in 2010			1
the budget compromise largely tracks the @entity5 administration 's initial $ 3.67 billion proposed spending plan , with the notable exception to drop his $ 250 billion request for potential bailouts of struggling financial institutions			1
fiscally conservative @entity22 , known as @entity130 , also negotiated with @entity69 leaders to cut $ 10 billion from the president 's $ 540 billion request for non-defense discretionary spending			1
in an additional nod to her caucus 's conservatives , @entity27 and @entity14 majority whip @entity139 sent a letter to @entity15 leaders " throwing down the gauntlet " to insist that a pay - as - you - go system be followed , which would require new federal spending to be offset with budget cuts or tax increases , a @entity69 aide said			1
@entity5 called for the " @entity149 " legislation in his weekend radio address			2
the president also gathered his @entity152 members last week and challenged them to cut a total of $ 100 million in the next 90 days			0
in the context of the federal budget , $ 100 million in savings is a tiny amount , critics say			2
it is the equivalent , according to one example , of having a car dealer offer to shave $ 1 from the cost of a $ 36,700 vehicle			0
" any amount of savings is obviously welcome , " senate minority leader @entity164 , @entity165 , said at the time			0
" but [ $ 100 million is ] about the average amount we 'll spend every single day just covering the interest on the stimulus package that we passed earlier this year			0
" @entity14 press secretary @entity172 said ordinary @entity66 would nevertheless appreciate the savings effort			2
" only in @entity0 , is $ 100 million not a lot of money			0
it is where i 'm from			0
it is where i grew up			0
and i think it is for hundreds of millions of @entity66			0

@entity15 votes in favor of budget 53 - 43 ; @entity14 votes 233 - 193
no @entity13 in either *chamber* voted for measure
house speaker says new budget " is a statement of our national values "
