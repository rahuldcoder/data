one of the most striking aspects of the massive protests that have broken out across @entity2 is the intensity of the people 's anger directed at the @entity6			1
welcome to the second wave of the @entity2 revolution			1
millions of people have poured onto the streets , marking the first anniversary of @entity13 's swearing - in as @entity2 's president with a demand that he step down immediately and make way for new elections			1
if @entity13 refuses , they plan a campaign of civil disobedience that could paralyze the country			2
now the army has stepped in with an ultimatum , telling @entity13 he has 48 hours to satisfy the protesters ' demands			2
the organizers , a group known as @entity28 or " rebel , " say they have already collected 22 million signatures in support of their demands			0
that 's far more than the 13 million votes @entity35 -- the candidate of the @entity6 -- received in the presidential election , and a sign that discontent has spread beyond the liberals , or former regime supporters			1
the opposition 's push for new elections has clearly capitalized on @entity13 's dismal record , particularly on the economy 's downward spiral and the chaotic security situation			1
but there 's more to this protest than a call for jobs , bread and safe streets			1
@entity13 has few friends as deadline looms underpinning the calls for change is a growing understanding of the meaning of democracy , and an increasingly pervasive sense that what @entity2 has had under @entity13 is not the system that @entity2 had in mind in 2011 when they overthrew a deeply entrenched dictatorship			1
when @entity2 poured into the streets in early 2011 , they wanted to topple @entity69 , the dictator who had ruled the country for three decades			1
they succeeded in ending dictatorship , but their revolution took a sharply different turn from the one envisioned by the young idealists who occupied @entity76 's @entity75			2
unlike the @entity6 , @entity69 's rule had no overarching ideology other than cementing his hold on power			2
@entity82 , by contrast , has a distinct ideology , and it is moving steadily , if gradually , to put it into place			0
it essentially wants to use its interpretation of @entity87 as the guiding principle for the individual , society and the state			0
and it ultimately wants to unify all @entity6 states into one , to " liberate them from foreign imperialism			2
" what happens to the @entity6 in @entity2 will affect @entity6 parties across the region			1
already its image of incompetence and noninclusiveness is a stain that will be difficult to erase			0
in @entity2 , @entity104 parties quickly moved to the forefront of the @entity107 political scene			2
the @entity108 , as the @entity6 is known , had a head start in political organizing			2
it competed on a stage where other parties had barely taken shape , vying for voters who had practically no experience with democracy			0
not surprisingly , the @entity6 won every election , although its margin of victory steadily narrowed			2
@entity122 activists had struggled to explain to voters a number of basic democratic concepts , such as secularism , protection of minorities and rule of law			0
now @entity13 and the @entity6 have done @entity2 a great service by demonstrating what these ideas mean			1
many @entity2 protesters accuse @entity13 of governing for the benefit of the @entity6 rather than for the country as a whole			1
a year under @entity13 has shown some of the important yet subtle aspects of democratic rule , such as the fundamental concept that winning elections does not mean the winner gets to ignore all the concerns of the opposition			0
the @entity6 's intentions and @entity13 's credibility started to become troubling when they repeatedly broke their word			1
they vowed not to field a candidate for president , not to seek to control the parliament , not to try to dominate the constitution - writing process			0
and they broke every promise			0
@entity13 's reputation took a steep dive after he seized dictatorial powers in november			1
the protests forced him to reverse course , but he failed to lead the country through its " @entity159 , " the pivotal period in history when it has the opportunity to reach a national consensus -- much more than an electoral victory -- to write a constitution that is embraced as legitimate by the nation as a whole			0
instead , @entity13 and the @entity108 have taken their thin electoral victory as justification for gradually expanding their hold on the country 's institutions			2
they rammed through a constitution that does not provide a strong guarantee of equality for women and for minorities			0
they have allegedly worked to suppress critical media , allowed inflammatory speech against @entity182 , and rejected all criticism as work of foreigners and " falool , " as nostalgic remnants of the @entity69 dictatorship are known			0
they have gone after nongovernmental organizations , seeking to hollow out the influence of grass - root groups , particularly those working on democracy education			0
ironically , one year under a @entity6 government has proven quite helpful in educating @entity2 about democracy			1
@entity13 and the @entity108 have inadvertently helped explain how in a democracy , the rights and the voices of minorities , even of election losers , must be heard			0
they have unwittingly shed some light on the complicated concept of secularism			0
in the first wave of elections , many voters thought if they were @entity6 -- as most @entity2 are -- they should vote for the @entity6			1
and they thought secular was synonymous with atheist			0
now they 're discovering how religion can be exploited for power			0
@entity2 accuse @entity13 and the brotherhood of engaging in a process of " @entity215 , " a quest to take control of state institutions and impose their @entity104 views on the population			1
unfortunately for @entity13 and the @entity6 the protesters are more experienced this time around			1
@entity2 have learned that it 's not enough to topple a dictator			2
it is unclear where this second wave will lead			0
the opposition is still divided and its small component parts may still not be large enough to defeat an @entity108 party in a new election			0
but the protests are a sign that the revolution is far from over , and this time its target is the @entity6 .			1

millions take to the streets to protest against @entity2 president @entity13
@entity239 : what 's striking is the intensity of anger at the @entity6
she says @entity2 realize that @entity13 's government is not living up to its promises
@entity248 : the discontent and protests show that @entity2 's revolution is far from over
