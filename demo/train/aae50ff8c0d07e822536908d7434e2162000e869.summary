-- what was supposed to be a straightforward cash deal to carry a child for desperate parents has turned into an international spat over who said what , and exposed the darker side of a business credited with creating happiness for many couples			0
at the center of the debate is @entity14 , a seven - month - old @entity15 baby with a congenital heart condition who is currently receiving treatment for a lung infection at a private hospital in @entity21			1
for days , @entity14 's surrogate mother , 21 - year - old @entity21 food stall worker @entity22 , has been telling local and foreign press that the couple abandoned their son , taking home his healthy sister			1
after initially denying they knew about @entity14 , a friend of the couple issued a statement to a local @entity31 newspaper saying the pair only left @entity14 because they were told he was likely to die			1
" @entity14 was very sick when he was born and the biological parents were told he would not survive and he had a day , at best , to live and to say goodbye , " the unnamed friend told the @entity34 , in @entity35 , where the couple live			1
fear and lies the friend said the surrogate mother gave birth at a different hospital to the one agreed upon , which made the surrogacy agreement void			1
the couple was scared , she said , that @entity22 would change her mind about the second child , and they 'd have to leave @entity21 with no children at all			1
according to the report , the friend noted that the backdrop to the surrogacy row was a military coup in the country and " it was very difficult to get around			0
" the takeover took place in the early hours of may 22 , 2014 when commander of the @entity59 announced in a national broadcast he was now in charge			0
" this has been absolutely devastating for them , they are on the edge , " the friend added , referring to the days of media scrutiny and debate over their decision , months after they returned home			2
@entity22 claimed the couple asked her to terminate the @entity15 child when she was seven months pregnant			1
not true , the couple 's friend said			2
after the babies ' birth , @entity22 claimed they bought nappies and milk for the baby girl , but " did n't even look at the boy			2
" also a lie , the friend added			0
whatever the details of who said what , the case has attracted attention to a largely unregulated industry subject to a confusing tangle of laws and loopholes			0
surrogate ' is legal parent ' in the state of @entity35 , where the couple is from , it 's legal to seek surrogacy abroad			2
there are no checks for criminal history , and no counseling is required for couples seeking offshore surrogacy , said @entity105 , an expert in @entity31 surrogacy law from the @entity107 in @entity108			2
" if surrogacy were taken onshore there would be counseling protocols prior to conception , as well as a welfare report after birth required before legal parentage is transferred ; but these are not steps that occur with offshore surrogacy , " said @entity105			0
she said the surrogate mother is the legal parent regardless of whose egg was used			1
the rights of the genetic father are also " uncertain " as " different judges have taken varied approaches , " she said			0
@entity31 authorities are looking into the case , as are @entity21 authorities , who had already announced a crackdown on the industry amid claims rules were being flouted			1
@entity22 said she agreed to be paid 300,000 baht ( $ 9,300 ) for carrying the couple 's babies , money she needed to help care for her own two children , aged six and three			2
after she voiced concerns about how she was going to pay for @entity14 's care , funds started flowing to an online campaign , which to date has raised more than $ 237,000 ( us $ 220,000 )			1
could baby girl be returned ? @entity22 said she 's prepared to take the baby girl back if the @entity31 couple is are " not ready " to take care of her			1
she said she does n't intend to pursue legal action against the parents , though @entity145 says she could apply to the @entity146 of @entity35 to have the child returned			0
" @entity148 of @entity35 has jurisdiction over anyone who has an interest in the care , welfare and a development of a child so ( the intending parents ) could still make their case and argue for the baby to live with them , " @entity105 said			0
" the court would examine the competitive proposals of the parties , probably appoint an independent children 's lawyer and do a welfare assessment of the child 's needs and then make a decision			0
" the @entity31 courts have only ever heard one case involving a child born via surrogacy , @entity145 said			2
it involved a child called " @entity174 " whose birth was the result of an agreement between friends that went wrong			0
" that was in the 1980s and they ended up removing the child from the family that had been raising her and taking her to the other family , " @entity105 said			0
" it was an altruistic arrangement where the birth mother changed her mind about seven months later			1
she got the child back			0

boy is now seven months old and in the care of his @entity21 surrogate mother
