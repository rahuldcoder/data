@entity0 -- the family of an @entity4 man who died after allegedly being beaten by a group of white teens and run over by a truck is asking state and federal officials not to seek the death penalty in the case			1
relatives of @entity13 , who died shortly after receiving his injuries on june 26 , sent a letter with their request to the prosecutor in the case , @entity21 district attorney @entity20			1
" we ask that you not seek the death penalty for anyone involved in @entity32 ' murder , " the letter states ; the letter is signed by @entity24 , @entity13 's sister who is in charge of , and speaks for , his estate			1
the letter states that the family is opposed to the death penalty partly for religious convictions			1
" our opposition to the death penalty is deeply rooted in our religious faith , a faith that was central in @entity32 ' life as well , " the letter states			1
but the family goes on to explain that there is another reason for their opposition , one that is tied to @entity49 's racial past			1
" we also oppose the death penalty because it historically has been used in @entity49 and the @entity52 primarily against people of color for killing whites , " the letter states			1
" executing @entity32 ' killers will not help to balance the scales			0
but sparing them may help to spark a dialogue that one day will lead to the elimination of capital punishment			0
" the family has been mostly private in its grief , but the letter sent to the @entity67 's office alludes to what the family is going through			1
" those responsible for @entity32 ' death not only ended the life of a talented and wonderful man			2
they also caused our family unspeakable pain and grief			2
but our loss will not be lessened by the state taking the life of another , " it says			1
the death of @entity13 , 48 , occurred early june 26 in @entity0 , allegedly at the hands of white teens who , after a night of partying and drinking , decided to go looking for black people to assault , law enforcement officials have said , quoting one of the suspects in the case			1
@entity96 's death drew national attention after @entity1 first reported it and aired exclusive surveillance video of the actual killing , captured by a parking lot security camera in a @entity0 suburb			1
@entity20 , the district attorney , has called it " vicious " and a " premeditated hate crime			0
" " we have a racially motivated killing , " said @entity20 , asserting that the group of white teens sought out a black person to kill			0
" the teens came to @entity0 and they picked out a black man , an innocent victim			0
they assaulted that victim , and then they just killed him			0
" @entity112 @entity111 investigators are now in @entity0 , investigating the death as a possible federal hate crime and assisting local prosecutors			2
the killing has also prompted several large marches and prayer vigils in @entity0 , a city of nearly 540,000 people			0
@entity13 , 19 , of @entity121 , @entity49 , is facing murder charges in @entity96 's death and is eligible for the death penalty			1
a second teen , @entity125 , 18 , was initially charged with murder , but a judge reduced the charge to simple assault because @entity125 was not believed to be driving the vehicle used to kill @entity96			1
however , @entity21 prosecutors said they plan to seek indictments against both @entity13 and @entity125 for murder and a hate crime , and will seek indictments against other teens who were at the scene			1
neither teen has entered a plea			0
the district attorney 's office has not officially commented on the family 's request for no death penalty in the case			1
last week the @entity96 family filed a wrongful death suit against all seven of the white teens alleged to have been present at the beating of @entity96 that immediately preceded him being run over by the truck			1
the @entity151 , a nationally recognized organization based in @entity152 , @entity153 , that opposes racism and intolerance , joined in the lawsuit			0
" @entity96 lost his life for no other reason than the color of his skin , " said @entity157 , chief trial counsel for the law center			1
" those responsible must be held accountable for their callous and deadly actions			0
we are filing this lawsuit today to ensure his family gets a measure of justice			0
" in addition to @entity13 and @entity125 , the lawsuit names five other teens as taking part in the incident that evening : @entity177 of @entity178 ; @entity179 ; and @entity180 , @entity181 and @entity182 , all of @entity121			1
none of the five has been arrested or charged , and it was unclear whether they had retained attorneys			0
@entity96 , a line worker at a @entity189 plant , sang in his church choir , the family 's attorney , @entity193 , told reporters			1
he leaves behind his partner of 17 years			0
" he was just a pillar of the community , " @entity193 said			0
" he paid his taxes on time , he went to work , came home -- he was just an average , ordinary citizen , good guy , wonderful gardener			0
" " anyone who knew @entity32 could see that he was a caring man with a beautiful smile , " said @entity96 's sister , @entity24 , in a previous statement			1
" he was such a compassionate person			0
we must take an honest look at the racial climate that motivated some young people to hurt such a wonderful person			0
" attorneys for @entity13 and @entity125 have not responded to requests for comment from @entity1			2
during a bond hearing , @entity13 's attorney told the court he saw nothing to back up the " racial allegations			1
" a civil trial can proceed at the same time as a criminal case , but often the civil case is delayed pending the resolution of a criminal trial			0
while a criminal case is pending , a defendant in a civil case may need to invoke the @entity230			0
the lawsuit alleges all seven of the teens " took part in what we call a joint venture , to seek out and do harm to a person of color , " @entity193 said			0
authorities believe @entity13 led and instigated the attack , which took place after a night of drinking in largely white @entity244 outside @entity0			2
@entity13 told friends they should leave , saying , " @entity247 fuck with some niggers , " officials said			2
the gang of teens climbed into @entity13 's green truck and a white suv and drove 16 miles to the western edge of @entity0			1
they would have seen @entity96 immediately as they exited the highway , officials said			2
he was standing in a hotel parking lot just beyond the exit ramp			0
on the videotape obtained exclusively by @entity1 , the group of teens is seen pulling into the parking lot and stopping where @entity96 is standing , although he is just off camera and not visible			2
the teens can then be seen going back and forth between their cars and @entity96			2
witnesses told authorities this is when @entity96 's beating took place , as the teens yelled racial epithets , including " white power			1
" authorities allege @entity13 and many of the other teens pummeled @entity96 repeatedly as he crumpled to the ground , although this is not visible on the tape			1
after the beating , some of the teens left and others got into the green @entity284 truck			0
at this moment , @entity96 becomes visible on the tape as he staggers into view and walks toward the truck			2
" @entity288 drove the @entity289 out of the parking lot and turned right onto @entity291 , " the lawsuit says			0
" just as @entity13 turned right , his headlights shone directly on @entity96 , who , having been severely beaten , was stumbling in a grassy area near the motel 's entrance			1
@entity13 accelerated , drove onto and over the street curb , and struck @entity96 with the front of the @entity289			1
" shortly afterward , @entity13 allegedly boasted and laughed about the killing , according to statements some of the teens made to detectives			2
" i ran that n --- -- over , " he allegedly said in a phone conversation to the teens in the other car			0
" he was not remorseful , " district attorney @entity20 said			0
" he was laughing , laughing about the killing			0
" the proceedings of the case are taking place in the @entity21 courthouse , where in 1994 @entity312 was convicted in the notorious killing of civil rights leader @entity314 in 1963			2
that case and others have given @entity49 a racially charged history .			2

@entity96 's family opposes the death penalty for religious and historical reasons
