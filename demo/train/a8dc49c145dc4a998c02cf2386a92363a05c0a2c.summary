@entity0 -- as @entity3 sen. @entity2 defends her @entity5 seat in @entity6 , a new @entity1 / @entity8 poll indicates the third - term incumbent carries a slim advantage over her closest @entity12 rival in the general election this november			1
but this is @entity6 , and the election system can be complicated			0
there are nine candidates -- republicans , @entity3 , and a @entity19 -- on the ballot this november , and if no candidate crosses the 50 % threshold , the race moves into a december runoff between the top two contenders			1
@entity2 currently falls well below the 50 % mark at 43 % support among likely voters			1
@entity29 rep. @entity29 comes in second at 40 % , according to the survey			0
but the poll 's sampling error among likely voters is plus or minus four percentage points , meaning the two candidates are about even			1
in a state with large swaths of conservative voters , @entity2 is considered one of the most vulnerable @entity3 up for re-election this year			0
republicans , eager to take control of the @entity5 , have focused on the race as a potential pick - up seat			0
the @entity12 needs a net gain of six seats to retake the majority			0
politics of fear -- how the @entity12 is using @entity50 against @entity3 if the horse race in @entity6 stays relatively the same , @entity2 and @entity29 would be the two candidates heading into the runoff -- and that 's when things flip			1
the poll indicates that @entity29 would fare slightly better in a runoff than @entity2 , 50 % -47 %			1
" keep in mind that the electorate in december is probably going to be smaller and quite a bit different from those who turn out to vote in november , " @entity1 polling director @entity58 said			2
but the poll 's likely voter model can only estimate the november electorate , he added , and turnout is going to be extremely important in december			1
" @entity2 wins a majority in a two - way race among all registered voters , but we know that only a small fraction of them will come out for a runoff , " he said			1
amid worrisome polls , @entity3 make new pitch for women in her re-election bid , @entity2 has been touting her position as chairwoman of the @entity80 as a boon to her oil - rich state			0
like many democrats in tight re-election bids from reddish states , @entity2 has also kept president @entity86 at arm 's length due to his low approval ratings			2
the @entity1 / @entity8 poll shows that only 40 % of @entity6 voters approve of the job @entity86 is doing in office			1
instead , she has been selling a bipartisan record of working across the aisle and voting independent of her party			0
but @entity2 has faced a slew of negative headlines this fall , including questions about her residency and improper uses of taxpayer - funded travel			0
and @entity12 , including @entity29 , seized on a recent photo showing @entity2 helping a @entity106 fan perform a keg stand during a tailgate party			1
@entity29 , however , is seeking to paint @entity2 as a rubber stamp for @entity86			0
and as a physician and a three - term congressman who was a vocal opponent of @entity112 , @entity29 is trying make health care reform a big issue in the race			0
as the incumbent , @entity2 has a large fundraising advantage over @entity29 , having brought in $ 14 million compared to @entity29 's $ 8.6 million , according to the @entity118			2
@entity119 : the secret weapon that could save @entity121 @entity3 ? @entity3 outside groups have invested heavily in the race , spending nearly six times the amount @entity12 have spent in opposition			2
according to the poll , @entity2 does extremely well in urban areas and carries 85 % of the non-white population but gets clobbered in the suburban parts of @entity6			2
interestingly , women only slightly back @entity2 more than men , 48 % -45 % -- a departure from polls that generally show incumbent @entity3 women with a wider gender gap that can prove favorably in the voting booth			2
the poll was conducted for @entity1 by @entity8 by telephone with 1,013 adult americans on september 22 - 25 .			0

a new @entity1 poll shows the @entity143 race is very close
sen. @entity2 leads her @entity12 challenger by only three points
gap is within the poll 's sampling error
if no candidate gets more than 50 % in november , there 's a runoff
