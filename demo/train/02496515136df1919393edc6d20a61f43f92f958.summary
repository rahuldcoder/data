-- a @entity2 judge ruled thursday that a boy who murdered his father , a @entity5 leader , will serve his sentence in a yet - to - be - named juvenile detention facility			1
the boy was 10 when he killed his father , @entity9			1
he is now 13 and could remain at the facility until he is 23			1
@entity9 was asleep on a couch in his family 's @entity13 home when his son killed him on may 1 , 2011 , according to authorities			1
@entity0 is not naming the boy because he is a juvenile			2
@entity9 had been the @entity18 regional director for the @entity19 , according to an online tribute to him from the group 's leader , @entity23			1
one of the nation 's biggest , most well - known @entity5 organizations , the @entity19 idolizes @entity26 and touts virulent rhetoric against those who are @entity29 , immigrants and not " pure - blood whites , " according to the @entity32 civil rights group			1
prosecutors contend the victim 's @entity5 background is not linked to his death , saying the young killer 's concerns about abuse and his family being split up were more significant factors			2
" it was our belief that this would have happened even if ( @entity9 ) was not part of the @entity19 , " said @entity42 , a spokesman for the @entity13 district attorney 's office			2
" this was done more on a domestic level			0
" the boy was detained in juvenile halls in @entity13 after the shooting			0
his lawyers initially sought an insanity defense but later dropped that approach and argued their client did n't fully grasp the ramifications of what he did , the spokesman said			0
the murder trial before county judge @entity60 -- and not a jury -- got underway october 30 , 2012 , continuing off - and - on for about 10 days over four months , ending january			0
as there are no " guilty " or " not guilty " verdicts in her @entity2 juvenile court , @entity60 instead found it " true " that the boy had committed second - degree murder and understood his actions were wrong			0
@entity0 's @entity70 contributed to this report .			0
