-- for the past week , the political fireworks surrounding the landmark decision by the @entity3 to uphold the @entity4 rivaled the excitement of @entity7 pyrotechnics			0
president @entity8 is facing heavy criticism from @entity10 that he has raised taxes on working - and middle - class @entity12 because the court upheld the individual mandate based on @entity17 ' power to tax			1
the president and the @entity20 are arguing that the mandate is not a tax but rather a penalty , since those who do not buy health insurance are paying a penalty in the form of a tax			1
meanwhile , on monday a top adviser to @entity30 raised consternation among @entity10 by saying that the individual mandate is not a tax , countering the prevailing conservative view			2
soon after , @entity30 himself made his much anticipated statement on the issue on tv , saying that since the @entity3 has declared that the individual mandate is a tax , then it must be a tax			1
tax ? not a tax ? what 's going on ? the fact of the matter is this : as for who wins the @entity50 , there is probably very little at stake for either @entity30 or president @entity8 in the debate over the tax status of the individual mandate			1
however the mandate is enforced -- as a tax or as a penalty -- it is a rounding error in the total tax increases in the @entity4			1
the @entity59 estimates the individual mandate will raise $ 17 billion in revenue for the @entity62 between 2015 , when the first taxes or penalties would be collected under the provision , and 2019			2
aside from the individual mandate , the health care law includes numerous tax increases , for a total of more than $ 400 billion between 2010 and 2019 , according to estimates by the @entity71			1
about half that amount , $ 210 billion over 10 years , comes from the increase in the @entity75 payroll tax and a new @entity75 tax on interest , rent and other investment income for individuals who earn more than $ 200,000 or families that earn $ 250,000 annually			0
but other changes that raise @entity12 ' tax bills include the reduction in the maximum annual contribution -- now capped at $ 2,500 -- to @entity87 ( your employer might call it your " cafeteria plan " to help pay for medical expenses )			0
there is also an increase in the percent of your income that you must spend on medical expenses before those expenses are tax deductible , up to 10 % from 7.5 %			0
these two provisions taken together will raise taxes by about $ 28 billion over the law 's first decade			0
by 2019 , the year when all the health care law 's tax increases will be in effect , the taxes raised by the @entity4 are estimated to be 0.49 % of gdp			1
that is the 10th largest tax increase since 1950			0
in 2019 , it will be the largest tax increase in the 26 years since @entity111 's 1993 tax increases			2
whether the $ 17 billion from the individual mandate is a tax is hardly necessary for the @entity10 to argue that president @entity8 raised taxes			1
nor does the mandate being a penalty clear the president 's record on taxes			0
the @entity8 administration and democrats point out that the @entity59 has estimated the health care law will reduce total annual budget deficits between now and 2021			1
there is considerable controversy over the estimate of the effect of the health care law on deficits , but that aside , it will raise taxes -- and a lot of them			1
some republicans insist that campaigning against the president on the individual mandate as a tax is still important			1
because while most of the taxes are levied on employers , corporations and high - earners ( including small businesses ) , the individual mandate is a direct tax on low - and middle - income @entity12			2
if the mandate is a tax , they argue , the president has broken his pledge not to raise taxes on working - and middle - class @entity12			2
but , in the court of public opinion , conservatives have already won on the issue of the individual mandate			1
time and time again , when polled over the last two years , a majority of @entity12 have opposed the national requirement to buy health insurance			0
looking at self - identified independent voters , those swing voters who decide elections , a march 2012 @entity160 survey found that only 32 % supported a mandate with a " penalty " for noncompliance			0
while the charge that " you raised taxes on hard - working @entity12 " is a good go - to move in @entity12 politics , it might not be possible for @entity10 to gain more political advantage off the individual mandate than they already have			2
so what will matter to voters on @entity176 ? how about principled arguments about what " good government " looks like and the proper balance between personal economic security and individual liberty ? and what about a clear , concrete vision for returning prosperity to working - and middle - class @entity12 ? those can be winning issues			0
for one of the candidates and for all @entity12			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity193 .			0

@entity193 : republicans , @entity20 argue if the individual mandate is a tax or penalty
@entity193 : debate over the tax status has little effect on who wins the @entity50
she says the health care law includes tax increases much higher than the mandate
@entity193 : conservatives have already won on the mandate issue , as indicated by polls
