-- when making a big decision , how aware are you of the underlying brain processes informing your choices ? when you go with your gut instinct , are you aware of the bodily signals that have informed your actions ? while it may seem that there is no time for the close inspection of the body and mind at these critical times , enlightened leaders are turning towards mindfulness training as a way to reprogram their mind in a bid to stay sane and pull ahead in today 's challenging business environment			1
not only does this allow individuals to clearly see the intentions and reactions underlying each and every action -- learning when an action is arising out of fear of uncertainty or rejection and becoming better able to detect a " sure thing " via bodily signals			0
by repeatedly training the mind to pay attention to the sensations of the body as they enter the brain , mindfulness training uses this information to build up an exquisitely sensitive understanding of our reactions and responses in the world -- both at work and elsewhere in our lives			1
the term mindfulness refers to a particular state of mind , one that is alert , aware and fully present to what is unfolding on a moment by moment basis in the mental and physical landscape			2
importantly , this awareness includes an element of acceptance , not judging whatever you discover in the process			0
the route to mindfulness is through attention training			1
in our general understanding , attention is something we direct outwards into the environment -- something pleasant catches our attention and we turn to look , something annoying distracts us and our mind wanders			0
this process changes the neural connectivity between regions of the brain related to attention and concentration			1
sounds great , but what 's the catch ? the catch is that you need to train to get these benefits			0
similar to visiting the gym and repeatedly lifting weights to develop muscles , to improve focus , concentration , and build emotional resilience you need to train your brain			2
an in - depth understanding of mindfulness from reading about it does not count as it is not training the neural networks			1
bringing your attention in a sustained way to the breath and the body is the starting point of these practices			0
to obtain the best results , this training in done in a quiet dedicated environment			2
for example , 20 minutes of mindfulness practice in the morning will radically change how you experience your working day and relate to others			2
in the early stages of training , similar to when we first go to the gym , there is frustration and annoyance with our inability to stay focused and the effort required			2
this is because we are training these neural networks for the first time and the wetware of the brain is floppy and the mind undisciplined			1
the mind gets easily bored and distracted and thinks of a million other things it should be doing			0
we might also be alarmed when we see the quantity of mental activity that we were n't aware of at all ! with practice however , the ability to stay focused becomes easier , productivity increases , there is less distraction from emails and phone calls and memory improves			0
one study has shown that mindfulness training helps reduce the age - related decline in the number of neurons in the hippocampus -- a region of the brain vital for memory			1
perhaps most importantly , we can learn to be really present and attentive with those who really matter -- our loved ones			0
where is your mind when your phone beeps and vibrates during a family dinner ? high pressure situations , those involving emotions such as fear and anxiety , are when reactive mental habits are most likely to be triggered			0
mindfulness allows us to see more clearly how draining this is in terms of our brain 's energy reserves and how this clogs up our ability to problem solve in a creative way			1
@entity169 creates constriction in the mind , meaning we tend to stick with what we know and lose the ability to think flexibly			0
this happens at the level of the individual and in a wider sense in organizations			0
precisely at the time when we need to be creative , the conditions of uncertainty about our economic future leads to behaviors that are constricted and conservative and more likely to keep us stuck			0
engaging with the bodily sensations related to these negative emotions is at the heart of mindfulness			1
improvements in attention are a happy side effect of mindfulness but the real changes occur when we are able to embrace fear in an accepting way			2
those who are willing to fail , and can sit with the uncertainty of not knowing will be those who ultimately succeed because their mental resources have been freed up in a way that allows creativity and flexible thinking to emerge			0
mindfulness training is found in sectors as diverse as health , sport , military , education , and in the boardroom			1
tomorrow 's leaders know that it will take more than technical expertise and access to facts and figures to remain competitive			0
hence giants such as @entity213 and @entity214 now include mindfulness training within their organizations			1
the ability to communicate , to really listen , to be flexible in responding , and to be creative and courageous in decision making are the so - called " soft " skills that leaders are realizing are essential for the health and growth of their talent and business			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of dr @entity227 .			1

business leaders are taking up mindfulness training to make better decisions , says dr @entity227
studies show the training can help reduce the age - related decline in the brain
@entity213 and @entity214 are just some businesses using mindfulness training
