just when you think @entity2 can not horrify any more than it has , the group sends us to a new level of disbelief			1
the latest news from the @entity8 -- the release of a video allegedly showing the @entity12 pilot @entity13 deliberately burned alive by his captors -- is the latest example			1
how can we comprehend human beings behaving in this way ? the highly produced videos of decapitations have continued coming , and now this			2
it 's tempting to think this is the work of a small number within @entity2 , perhaps a core of psychopaths , given free rein by the so - called @entity28 's leaders			1
but these are not isolated incidents			2
this is a very deliberate policy of a strategically coherent group that has defeated armies and captured and held a significant swath of the @entity8			2
this is @entity2 very deliberately pursuing a policy that it believes will help it achieve its ultimate objectives			1
these are acts of brutality by an organization that has sought to make ruthlessness one of its most distinctive characteristics			1
indeed , far from apologizing for its inhumanity , @entity2 advertises it proudly , it taunts the world with it , and goes to great lengths to confirm that the acts that horrify us are not the work of rogue members but are , indeed , the organization 's policy			1
cruelty is a key component of the @entity2 brand			1
the group has managed to conquer large parts of @entity61 and @entity62 with a systematic and efficient plan			2
like everything else it does , broadcasting barbarism is a calculated strategy			2
but why ? @entity68 has psychological , strategic and ideological objectives			0
that 's why other fighting forces have resorted to cruelty to achieve their objectives			0
history is replete with examples that we see echoed today			0
as we avert our eyes from the carnage , from beheadings , mass executions and crucifixions ; as we try to avoid looking at the worst of the online videos , it is apparent that the strategy has the potential to create a huge and powerful backlash			0
that cruelty is turning much of the world , including @entity89 and @entity90 , against @entity2			1
and the atrocities against @entity94 and other @entity93 citizens are all but inviting the world 's most powerful armies to take on the @entity98 militias			2
and yet , by showing its fighters massacring the enemy without mercy , by flooding social media with the gruesome images , @entity2 sends several messages that its leaders believe bring benefits that outweigh the risks			1
long before we heard what happened to @entity94 hostage @entity111 back in august , months before we learned that @entity2 had killed hundreds of men , women and children of @entity62 's @entity117 minority , burying some of them alive , the people of the @entity8 had become acquainted with the mass executions , the brutal persecution of minorities , the killing of @entity123 , of @entity124 , and of @entity125 or anyone else who posed a challenge , hesitated to follow its religious dictates , or resisted the @entity2 advance in @entity61 and then @entity62			1
cruelty communicates fearlessness , and fearlessness , coupled with battlefield success , is an irresistible draw			0
it 's no wonder @entity2 has attracted large numbers of men eager to fight , including hundreds from @entity138			1
they share the goal , as one defector told @entity3 , of establishing an @entity143 state in the @entity89 world and then taking the campaign to other countries			2
beheading the enemy is an effective recruiting appeal to a small but not insignificant segment of the population that is enticed by the brazenness and ideological fervor			0
to them , mostly young @entity90 men , the barbarism resonates with their own brand of hatred and lust for revenge : revenge over real or perceived slights against @entity90			0
the religious justification for the executions , described by @entity2 as part of its jihad -- a war to return the reign of an @entity143 caliphate and impose the @entity170 's dictates -- gives the killings moral , theological clearance , all but precluding empathy toward nonmembers			1
in addition , by advertising its methods , @entity2 intimidates the armies it faces , causing some soldiers to flee before battle , even leaving their weapons behind , as we saw when @entity2 took over @entity183			1
the executions of hundreds of enemy soldiers , those who chose to fight , have appeared in videos , a warning to others			0
and the method also works to keep populations in line after @entity2 takes over territory and enforces its rule			1
of course , @entity2 is not the first organization to use barbarism as a weapon of war ; to use cruelty as a method of policy enforcement			1
in the @entity207 , the @entity201 , an institutionalized effort to root out heresy and strengthen the hold of the @entity205 and its allies , made it well known that those who did not fully comply with its wishes would suffer unspeakable punishments , from torture to being burned alive			1
many militant movements throughout history have managed to erase from their followers an essential element of their humanity -- a part that we think could never be destroyed inside us			0
we can not imagine deliberately inflicting pain on another , particularly someone who has not harmed us			0
but it turns out that our restraints against cruelty can be destroyed			0
history is replete with examples : the millions killed by the @entity228 in @entity229 , as they sought to build a communist utopia			0
the industrialized killing factories built by @entity233 during @entity234 , which had no military value			0
however , they played the key role within @entity239 ideology of exterminating unwanted people , principally @entity240 , but also the disabled , homosexuals , @entity243 ( @entity243 ) and other " inferior " peoples			0
the genocide in @entity248 , in which ethnic hatred unleashed a genocidal wave that left 800,000 dead , most hacked with machetes by their neighbors			0
other jihadi groups operating today have shown no compunction about killing civilians , women and children , about kidnapping girls in @entity258 , about blowing up city markets in @entity260 , buses in @entity262 , restaurants , cafes and hotels in @entity266 , @entity267 or @entity268			0
the common denominator throughout history until today is an ideology that justifies everything for the search of a " higher " goal , one usually suffused with some utopian vision of a perfect world			2
it is a world that has no room for anyone who disagrees with those seeking to make it a reality and finds in cruelty a recruiting tool for the cause and a fully justified method in pursuit of ultimate success			2
along the way , it turns men who were once presumably normal , even lovable , children into black - hooded executioners capable of taking a knife to the neck of a man kneeling at their feet , or of setting on fire another human being , a @entity90 man , no less .			0
