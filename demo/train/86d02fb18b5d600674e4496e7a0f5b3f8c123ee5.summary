-- after @entity2 , @entity3 and @entity4 , another company is now rumored to be building a smart watch : @entity7 's electronics giant @entity8			1
according to @entity11 , citing a source familiar with the matter , @entity8 is building both a smart watch and a product similar to @entity14			1
" the company has spared no efforts to invest in products that it believes are must - haves to stay ahead technology wise in the market , whatever the situation may be , " the source said			0
of course , details about the devices are lacking , which means we now have not one but four " upcoming " smart watches , and absolutely nothing is known about any of them			0
it 's possible these companies consider the smart watch the next big thing			2
remember some of these companies , namely @entity8 , have built a phone - watch hybrid ( pictured above ) before			0
however , we 're more inclined to believe that nowadays , no major consumer electronics manufacturer wants to be left behind on a new product category , even while we 're still deep in rumor territory			0
