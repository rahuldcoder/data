-- the @entity1 was expected thursday to seize the original hard drives from the surveillance system at @entity4 , where 17 - year - old @entity5 was found dead in a rolled - up gym mat earlier this year , according to a source with knowledge of the investigation surrounding the hard drives			1
@entity13 @entity12 issued a grand jury subpoena to seize the hard drives , the source said			1
@entity5 's family waited months for hundreds of hours of surveillance video , hoping it would yield answers about their son 's january death , but they were disappointed to learn that the four cameras inside the @entity24 , @entity25 , gymnasium showed only a few collective seconds of @entity5 , jogging			1
the camera fixed on the gym mats was blurry			0
the @entity30 ' attorneys were not shy in stating their suspicion that someone could have tampered with the videos			0
attorney @entity34 has questioned why time codes were n't shown in the videos			0
" we do n't have any time code with which to synchronize the events that are shown in the video			0
... either the cameras did this on their own or a human being interacted to make these cameras do these things , " @entity34 said			0
@entity46 insisted last month that the video it provided to the family and @entity0 is " a raw feed with no edits , " and the county sheriff 's office , which asserts @entity5 accidentally died while reaching for a shoe in one of the mats , says it did n't edit any files , according to their lawyers			1
@entity0 , which filed suit to secure access to the video , hired forensic video analyst @entity60 to analyze more than 290 hours of material from all 35 cameras inside and outside of the gym			1
@entity60 is a @entity65 @entity64 consultant and contract instructor for the @entity67 in @entity68 , @entity69			2
@entity5 's family holds rally after filing complaint about missing organs @entity0 also provided @entity60 and his company , the @entity74 , @entity76 - based @entity75 , with hundreds more hours of video from 31 cameras in other parts of @entity4			1
@entity60 quickly knocked down most of the @entity81 ' concerns -- they 're all easily explained , he said -- but his examination raised what could be another mystery : at least an hour of missing video from all four cameras inside the gym			1
@entity60 told @entity0 he found that " highly suspicious , " especially considering how the material was acquired by police			0
@entity0 has requested access to the original surveillance servers , which has not yet been granted			0
but @entity60 cautioned that the video could be gone , as newer surveillance would replace it if it was n't recovered promptly from the school 's digital video recorder			2
the files given to him by @entity0 are not original , @entity60 has said			0
" they 're not something investigators should rely on for the truth of the video			0
" the analyst added : " the investigator 's responsibility is to acquire the entire digital video recording system and have their staff define what they want to obtain			2
" coroner slams handling of @entity5 case authorities have said they did n't receive a copy of the videos until several days after @entity5 's body was found , according to an unredacted report obtained by @entity0 after a legal process			1
according to an incident report from the sheriff 's office , a detective watched a portion of the video , then asked an information technology officer employed by the school board to produce a " copy of the surveillance video for the entire wing of the school with the old gym for the last 48 hours			1
" five days later , the sheriff 's report says , the it officer delivered a hard drive to the detective , who verified it contained what he requested			2
" right now , what they 've done , is they 've left it up to the school district as to what it is they want to provide to the police , and i think that probably is a mistake , " @entity60 said			0
" you do n't want somebody who might be party to the responsibility to make the decision as to what they provide the police			0
" @entity158 , @entity5 's mother , said of the case , " we 're going to fight until it 's all over , until we get the truth			1
" federal prosecutor will look into @entity5 case @entity0 's @entity165 contributed to this report , which was written by @entity167 .			2
