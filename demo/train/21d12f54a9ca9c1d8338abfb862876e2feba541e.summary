-- a @entity2 newspaper has reversed its policy against publishing same - sex wedding announcements after rejecting a couple 's ad last week , stirring controversy in the community and beyond			1
the @entity10 will accept for publication announcements of same - sex marriages , engagements and anniversaries if the marriage takes place in a state or country where it 's legally recognized , editor @entity9 announced over the weekend			1
the newspaper will not publish announcements for non-legally recognized marriages , such as civil unions and commitment ceremonies , he said			2
" we inform the public , plain and simple , " he said			0
" we report on many , many things that we neither endorse nor condemn			0
that 's the nature of news			0
some people would like us to deny that gay marriage is legally recognized in several states and countries			1
to not recognize that fact is to deny or distort the truth , something we 're not willing to do			0
" we bring readers marriage announcements , engagement announcements and anniversary announcements because it informs them of what people around them are doing			0
we tried to set a reasonable standard for what constitutes news in this arena , and we think a legally recognized marriage fits that bill			1
" the old policy drew attention after the newspaper refused to publish an announcement from @entity55 residents @entity53 , 31 , and her fiancee , 27 - year - old @entity57			1
@entity53 received an e-mail from the " celebrations editor " on july 23 and shared it with friends			0
one of those friends , @entity62 , posted a screen shot of the e-mail on @entity65 , @entity66 and @entity67 , where it " spread like wildfire , " @entity68 said			0
the uproar prompted a review of the policy , said @entity9 , who met with the couple july 24			0
amid the controversy , @entity53 and @entity74 said they received messages of support from as far as @entity79 and @entity80			0
the development comes just in time for their wedding on wednesday in @entity84 , where same - sex marriage is legal			1
the couple , who have been together since 2008 , said their ad would run in the @entity10 on sunday			1
" we are very proud of our community and everyone who supported us and this cause ! they are the reason for the policy change			1
they made their voices heard and change occurred because of it , " @entity53 said monday after landing in @entity84			2
the paper heard from more than 600 people in the @entity55 area and elsewhere , who appeared " equally divided " over the issue , @entity9 said in his column			2
the old policy stemmed from the marriage laws of both @entity2 and neighboring @entity108 , both of which do not recognize same - sex marriages legally performed in other states			1
" we are thrilled with the @entity10 's decision to reform their policy , " @entity53 said			2
" while it is a great step in the right direction we know there is still so much more to be done for true equality to be reached			0

editor : @entity121 will publish notices of legally recognized same - sex marriages
change comes after @entity55 couple *criticized* paper for rejecting their ad
their ad will run in the @entity10 after the couple marries in @entity84 , couple says
" we are very proud of our community and everyone who supported us , " couple says
