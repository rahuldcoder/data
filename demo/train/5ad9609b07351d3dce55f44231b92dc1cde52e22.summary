dr. @entity0 , a neurosurgeon , is author of the new book " @entity2 , " which will be published next month			1
this article originally appeared in the september 20 , 2009 , issue of @entity5 and @entity5			0
( parade ) -- i am going to let you in on a secret : when a person 's heart stops beating , it 's not the end			1
contrary to what you may think , death is not a single event			1
instead , it 's a process that can be interrupted			1
@entity0 says the latest cpr techniques can save the lives of vicitims of cardiac arrest			1
on january 23 , 2008 , the 59 - year - old @entity27 man was driving home from work			1
the last thing he remembers is pulling into his complex 's driveway			1
@entity34 , a passing @entity35 driver , noticed a silver saturn wedged between a palm tree and a wall , with the engine running and a person slumped at the wheel			0
he switched off the car 's engine , pulled @entity24 out , and laid him on the ground			1
@entity34 called 911 and started pumping the older man 's chest			2
the next few minutes would be absolutely critical for @entity24			0
if you had been there , standing over @entity24 's lifeless body , would you have known what to do ? a person 's life can slip away in a few minutes			2
without a heartbeat , circulation slows to a halt			1
blood no longer flows to the organs , and the brain is the first one to suffer			1
in normal times , the brain , which constitutes 2 percent of our body mass , consumes about 20 percent of the oxygen the body takes in			1
after 10 seconds without oxygen , the brain 's functions slow			1
without oxygen or signals from the brain , other organs begin to break down			1
diaphragm muscles no longer contract and release to bring in air			0
the kidneys stop filtering blood			2
at the same time , an elaborate chain reaction triggers a breakdown in cells throughout the body			0
@entity5 : 4 diseases you can fight with exercise scientists and physicians are now learning that this process can be reversed			2
when it comes to cardiac arrest , however , the chances of surviving an episode outside a hospital are poor			0
only 2 percent of victims pull through without long - term damage			2
the no. 1 thing that has been shown to make a difference is the action of a bystander			0
if a passerby jumps in and gives cpr , as @entity34 did , the likelihood of survival rises significantly			2
but if onlookers do nothing , those chances drop -- fast			0
according to the @entity110 , for every minute that goes by without someone attempting @entity103 , the survival rate decreases 7 to 10 percent			0
studies have found that bystanders perform cpr in only 20 to 30 percent of cases			2
researchers say it 's not because people do n't want to help -- it 's because they 're apprehensive about putting their mouths on someone else 's , especially if the person is dying			2
but what i 'm about to tell you may change your mind about what you can do in a situation like @entity24 's			2
more than 15 years ago , cardiologist @entity127 and researchers at the @entity130 's @entity129 were puzzling over how to get more people to give cpr			1
to simplify the method , they wondered what would happen if they advocated performing compressions without mouth - to - mouth respiration			1
after running successful laboratory trials , @entity127 spoke to emergency - services directors in @entity27 , @entity140 , and @entity141			2
they were intrigued by his findings and agreed to promote the use of compression - only cpr among people in their states			1
they also implemented a protocol for their paramedics and firefighters that emphasized giving chest compressions with minimal interruptions to keep the patient 's blood circulating			1
@entity5 : 8 ways to stay healthy the results were remarkable : not only were survival rates for people who got only compressions just as good as those for people who got traditional cpr , they actually were better			1
why was it so effective ? mouth - to - mouth resuscitation supplies oxygen , which we need continuously			1
as it turns out , our bloodstreams contain plenty of oxygen at any moment			2
even if we stop breathing , our oxygen levels remain normal for quite a while			1
if we do stop breathing , however , the sole way to make the oxygen circulate is by having someone pump our chests			1
in 2007 , @entity183 researchers revealed the results of a massive study on bystander intervention			0
they looked at cases where a person ( not in a hospital ) suffered cardiac arrest in view of a bystander -- and with his or her heart in a rhythm that would respond to a defibrillator			0
the survival rate was 11 percent for those who got standard cpr -- mouth - to - mouth plus chest compressions -- before an ambulance arrived			1
the rate was 19 percent for those who got only compressions			2
the act of keeping oxygen circulating could increase a victim 's chances of surviving by as much as 70 percent			1
this is not a fancy technology born in a gleaming lab , yet it is one of the most significant recent breakthroughs in medicine			0
because heart disease is the biggest killer in the @entity222 , this simple act could save thousands of people 's lives every year			2
shortly after @entity34 began @entity103 , paramedics trained in the compression - only technique arrived			0
thanks to them and to an alert bystander , @entity24 survived			0
one day , the bystander could be you			0
@entity5 : 7 habits for a longer life remember : as soon as you see someone suffer what you think may be cardiac arrest , call 911 , start giving chest compressions 100 times a minute , and do n't stop for anything			1

advances in saving hearts stem cells : back when i was in medical school , i learned that any damage to the heart from a heart attack was permanent			0
this past summer , @entity254 researchers working on mice converted adult scar cells into stem cells , which they injected into damaged hearts			0
the cells restored heart - muscle performance , stopped the progression of damage , and regenerated injured tissue			0
scientists at @entity254 tell me this will soon be tested on humans			0
drug - releasing stents : people at risk for heart disease who have a blockage in the vessels supplying blood to their hearts may undergo an angioplasty to open the vessel			1
afterward , doctors often insert a stent ( a mesh tube ) to continue holding the artery open			0
the newest stents serve a dual role : they also release medication that prevents scar tissue from developing			0
@entity288 testing : you should have your cholesterol levels checked regularly			0
but you might also ask your doctor about getting your c - reactive protein , or @entity288 , checked			0
it is a marker for inflammation , a powerful risk factor for heart disease			0
changes in diet and exercise can usually reduce high @entity288 levels .			0

@entity0 : death is not a single event ; it 's a process that can be interrupted
without a heartbeat , circulation slows to a halt ; brain is first organ to suffer
in cpr , compressions are more important than mouth - to - mouth breathing
compressions keep oxygen - rich blood circulating to brain , other organs
