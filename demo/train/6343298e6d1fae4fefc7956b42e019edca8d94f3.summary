@entity0 -- nine new graphic cigarette warning labels showing cancerous lesions and other impacts of smoking were unveiled tuesday by the @entity6 , part of the agency 's sweeping new powers to regulate tobacco and tobacco products			1
" with these warnings , every person who picks up a pack of cigarettes is going to know exactly what risk they 're taking , " @entity13 secretary @entity12 told reporters			1
@entity12 called smoking and other tobacco use the " number one cause of preventable death " in @entity26 , claiming more than 440,000 lives a year			1
cigarette packages will now carry one vivid color image and one of these warnings about the consequences of smoking : " cigarettes are addictive " ; " tobacco smoke can harm your children " ; " cigarettes cause fatal lung disease " ; " cigarettes cause cancer " ; " cigarettes cause strokes and heart disease " ; " smoking during pregnancy can harm your baby " ; " smoking can kill you " ; " tobacco smoke causes fatal lung disease in nonsmokers " ; and " quitting smoking now greatly reduces serious risks to your health			1
" the warnings , which must be in place by september 2012 , will cover the upper portion of the pack both front and back			1
at least 50 % of the package will have to be covered			0
in addition , the warnings will have to cover at least 20 % of a cigarette ad			1
small ads less than 12 inches do n't require the 20 % coverage , but must still have a warning			0
each warning will also have a phone number -- 1 - 800 - quit - now -- that smokers can call to get help if they want to quit			0
according to @entity12 , a stall in the downward trend of smoking in @entity26 , particularly among young people , prompted president @entity67 to renew the focus on getting @entity26 to kick the habit or never start smoking in the first place			0
it is the first government - mandated label change for cigarettes in 25 years , she said , adding that a major motivation was targeting young people from wanting to smoke			2
" somebody said when they first saw the warning , these are really gross , and they are , " @entity12 said			0
" we want kids to understand smoking is gross , not cool			0
" the new packaging and ads , which must be in place by september 2012 , result from the @entity89 ( @entity89 ) , which mandates cigarette packs and advertisements have larger and " more visible graphic health warnings " as part of an effort to educate the public about the health risks associated with smoking			1
@entity97 , the commissioner of food and drugs at the federal @entity6 , said the nine images chosen for the new packaging requirements were tested for their impact on various target groups , such as teenagers and pregnant women			2
she noted that a pack - a - day smoker will confront the graphic photos more than 7,000 times a year			2
" this will be a dramatic change in what a cigarette package looks like , no doubt about it , " @entity97 said , later adding : " it will change the consumer response to a package of cigarettes , but frankly , that 's what we want			1
" @entity121 , director of cancer science and trends for the @entity123 , said the old labels have been virtually invisible because they 're small and have been around for so long			1
he said people have become immune and do n't really " see " them any more , but the new labels will be hard to ignore and will help focus attention on the problem			2
" this is going to be a very important element in the tobacco control tool box , but it 's not a panacea , " @entity121 said			2
" for smokers , it 's a new and very visible reminder that smoking can harm them , harm people around them , including children			0
for nonsmokers , it 's a reminder that smokers need their help and concern as far as quitting			0
the labels are not just for smokers , the labels are for anyone interested in public health			1
" @entity121 says about 20 % of the population still smokes , a number that has been pretty steady over the past five years			0
he hopes the new labels will jump - start a downward trend and reignite discussions about tobacco use			1
according to the @entity156 , about 443,000 people in the @entity26 die from smoking or exposure to secondhand smoke annually and more than 8 million are living with a disease that 's directly tied to smoking			0
the @entity156 says smoking is responsible for 90 % of all lung cancer deaths in men and 80 % in women			0
it estimates smoking causes 90 % of all chronic obstructive lung disease deaths such as bronchitis and emphysema			0
in january , both @entity168 and @entity169 , the two largest tobacco companies in the @entity26 , opposed the required warnings in letters to the @entity6			1
@entity168 , maker of some of the country 's best - selling brands such as @entity177 , @entity178 , @entity179 and @entity180 , said the new requirements violate the @entity182			1
the company said , in part , " the anti-smoking message is not intended to provide information that smokers and potential smokers can consider rationally in weighing the risks and perceived benefits from smoking			0
rather , it plainly conveys -- through graphic images and designs intended to elicit loathing , disgust , and repulsion -- the government 's viewpoint that the risks associated with smoking cigarettes outweigh the pleasure that smokers derive from them and , therefore , that no one should use these lawful products			1
" @entity168 said " by confiscating " the top 50 % of the package and 20 % of the ads , the government is not warning consumers about smoking risks -- it is telling consumers , ' do n't buy or use this product			1
' " the company is asking the @entity6 to withdraw the new rule , which it says is flawed , and issue a new one			0
@entity169 , the country 's largest tobacco company , supported the @entity89 legislation			1
but in its letter , the company raised questions about the constitutionality of the labels			1
" any government requirement that compels a private entity to carry a message not of its own choosing raises constitutional concerns ... to the extent that @entity6 were to select warnings based on their ability to evoke negative or cognitive reactions -- not their ability to objectively inform consumers about the health risks of smoking -- such warnings would not pass constitutional muster , " the company wrote			1
it said the sheer size of the warnings violates the @entity245			0
the tobacco companies are footing the bill for the new labels			2
however , @entity121 noted that tobacco - related disease and health problems cost $ 95 billion a year			2
" the cost of putting the pictures on is at the expense of the tobacco industry ; there is no cost to the government , " @entity121 said			0
" so this is not the government spending money , and yet what we are going to gain from it is less death and less disease -- and that 's going to save the government money			0
" with this new move , the @entity26 will be the 40th country to have picture warnings on our cigarette packs , making the country compliant with the @entity272 's global treaty on tobacco			1
under the treaty , 35 % of a cigarette pack must have warnings and pictures			2
the treaty has already been ratified by 173 of 192 member nations of the @entity279			0
the @entity26 is one of 19 countries that has not ratified the treaty , but with the new labels , will be compliant			0
countries such as @entity284 , @entity285 and @entity286 have long been leaders in tobacco control and have had very graphic art on their packaging for years			2
@entity1 's @entity291 contributed to this report .			0
