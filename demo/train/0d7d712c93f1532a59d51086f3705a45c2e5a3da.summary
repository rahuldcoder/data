editor 's note : @entity2 is senior lecturer in @entity3 at the @entity4 and the @entity5			1
his most recent book is " toward excellence with equity : an emerging vision for closing the achievement gap , " published by @entity4			1
he is the creator of the @entity12 and also the faculty co-chair and director of the @entity16 at @entity17			0
@entity2 says parents can play a key role in improving their children 's education			1
@entity22 , @entity23 ( @entity24 ) -- raising the quality of teaching and learning in @entity29 schools is a priority			1
it receives a great deal of attention in our national discourse and should receive more			0
test scores and graduation rates are improving faster in other nations than in the @entity29 and this threatens our quality of life in a competitive world			1
in addition , achievement gaps between racial groups in the @entity29 remain large			1
the social and political vitality of the nation may depend on closing these racial gaps			1
blacks and @entity51 are doing better than in the past compared to whites , but still not nearly good enough			0
making schools better should be only one part of our national strategy			0
life at home has been a relatively neglected topic and needs to come out of the shadows			0
especially in churches , neighborhood organizations , families and informal social networks , helping parents do their best needs to be as big a priority as achieving excellent schools			2
this goes beyond public policies			0
i am talking about changes in mindsets and lifestyles in a national social and cultural movement to close achievement gaps between groups -- a movement to achieve excellence with equity			1
more reading at home is a place to start			0
i present data in my recent book based on a large sample of students in elementary and secondary schools from several states			2
black and @entity92 students reported less leisure reading at home compared to whites , watched television more , were much more likely to have televisions in their bedrooms and ( perhaps as a consequence ) were more prone to become sleepy at school			1
also , blacks and @entity51 , including those with college - educated parents , reported fewer books in their homes than whites whose parents had fewer years of schooling			2
however , life at home helps shape academic outcomes long before children begin reading books			2
family - level supports in the first two years of life help predict achievement years later , in elementary school			2
beginning soon after birth , the most supportive mothers teach the joy of living and learning , through lots of active , encouraging , verbal and nonverbal communication			0
they engage actively in helping children learn to walk and talk and to explore their new world and manipulate their toys and other objects			2
such mothers exist in large numbers in every racial group			0
nonetheless , in a recent study by @entity4 's @entity134 and co-authors , differences in mother - child interaction patterns like these were found to account for one - third of the black - white gap in math and @entity139 skills at the beginning of kindergarten -- and one - quarter at the end of third grade			1
as children get older , highly responsive parents spend time with children , look for ways to be helpful and encourage them to voice their opinions			1
they are good listeners and they teach their children that they have a right to be heard and that people in positions of authority can sometimes be persuaded			0
the same parents can also be demanding , providing rules and structure and holding children consistently accountable for their behavior			1
professor @entity161 of @entity162 found in a nationally representative sample that students who achieved the highest test scores among blacks , @entity51 and whites had parents who were both responsive and demanding			1
according to the study , white parents were much more likely to be both responsive and demanding than black and @entity92 parents ; whereas black parents , in particular , were often highly demanding , but tended not to be as responsive in the ways the study measured			1
among early adolescents , differences along these dimensions helped account for the higher test scores of whites as compared with blacks and @entity51			0
findings like the above should be part of the conversation among black and @entity92 community leaders as they respond to the fact that even the children of college - educated parents often achieve at lower - than - expected levels			1
it is true that children of every racial group do better , on average , when their parents have more education			1
for example , black 12th graders whose parents completed college have higher average test scores than black 12th graders whose parents only completed high school			2
however , it is also true , according to the @entity207 , that test score gaps between 12th - grade blacks and whites with highly educated parents -- parents with 16 or more years of schooling -- are greater than test score gaps between 12th - grade blacks and whites whose parents have less education			2
these are unpleasant facts , but we can not improve what we fear and refuse to confront			0
yes , we should respectfully acknowledge and rectify injustices that have impeded the efforts of many non-white parents and we should also work relentlessly to provide high quality schooling opportunities for children from every background			1
but especially in our own homes and communities , there is another responsibility			0
it is to give parents of every racial and social - class background the examples , encouragement and supports they need to help their children experience the joy of learning and develop ambitious attitudes and habits of mind that will serve them well throughout their lives			1
as one effort to accept this responsibility , the @entity16 at @entity17 has begun convening the @entity247			0
beginning in september 2008 , researchers and parent leaders from communities in several states have met every four months at @entity4 to learn about relevant research , trade ideas , coach one another , and share examples of their own leadership			2
presentations and discussions have covered topics ranging from home - learning lifestyles to ways of helping schools and holding them accountable			0
the main purpose is to equip parent leaders with ideas and energy for helping others in home communities to help all our children succeed			0
in the @entity273 , legions of people worked in a multitude of ways for racial justice			0
however , the time has come for a movement focused on realizing our full human potential as learners			0
we need a movement for excellence with equity -- to prepare all our children for the social , ethical and intellectual challenges of a 21st century world			0
