-- the @entity1 of @entity2 and other @entity4 authorities in @entity5 covered up clerical child abuse until the mid- 1990s , according to a government - commissioned report released thursday			1
the @entity9 of @entity11 's 720 - page report said that it has " no doubt that clerical child sexual abuse was covered up " from january 1975 to may 2004 , the time covered by the report			1
" the @entity2 @entity1 's pre-occupations in dealing with cases of child sexual abuse , at least until the mid 1990s , were the maintenance of secrecy , the avoidance of scandal , the protection of the reputation of the @entity4 , and the preservation of its assets , " the report said			1
" the welfare of children , which should have been the first priority , was not even a factor to be considered in the early stages , " it said			0
" instead the focus was on the avoidance of scandal and the preservation of the good name , status and assets of the institution and of what the institution regarded as its most important members -- the priests			0
" archbishop @entity44 apologized thursday in a news conference			1
" no words of apology can ever be sufficient , " he said			1
and @entity48 , @entity5 's justice minister , said he felt a " a growing sense of revulsion and anger " as he read the report			1
" bottom line is this : a collar will protect no villain , " he said			0
the commission was set up in march 2006 to look into allegations of child sexual abuse made against clergy in the @entity5 capital			1
its report was completed in july			2
although the commission said it was not its place to " establish whether or not abuse occurred ... it is abundantly clear ... that child sexual abuse by clerics was widespread throughout the period			2
" one victim , @entity69 , said those who covered up the abuse were just as guilty as the perpetrators of the crimes			2
" how many people accused of abuse are still sitting in parishes today ? " she asked in a thursday news conference			2
the commission examined the histories of 46 priests , who were picked as a sample from 102 who had had complaints or suspicions of child abuse raised against them			1
complaints from more than 320 children were leveled against the 46 , the report said			2
but it said that the number of children abused likely exceeded that			0
" one priest admitted to sexually abusing over 100 children , while another accepted that he had abused on a fortnightly basis during the currency of his ministry which lasted for over 25 years , " the report said			0
" the total number of documented complaints recorded against those two priests is only just over 70			0
" in its analysis of the 46 priests , the commission said that all four archbishops -- archbishops @entity108 , @entity109 , @entity110 , and @entity111 -- who served during the time period covered by the report handled the child sexual abuse complaints " badly			1
" " not one of them reported his knowledge of child sexual abuse to the @entity120 ( the @entity5 police force ) throughout the 1960s , 1970s , or 1980s , " the report said			1
the commission did credit @entity111 , who took over the archdiocese in 1988 , with giving @entity5 authorities in 1995 the names of 17 priests against whom complaints had been made -- although it called the number incomplete , saying that there was " knowledge within the @entity1 of at least 28 priests against whom there had been complaints			2
" they said he was " slow to recognize the seriousness of the situation			0
" @entity111 also gave authorities permission to access the archdiocesan files in 2002			0
@entity111 , a cardinal , apologized in a written statement			0
" i wish to express without reservation my bitter regret that failures on my part contributed to the suffering of victims in any form , " he said			0
" although i am all too aware that such apologies and expressions of regret can never be adequate as a response to so much hurt and violation and , in any case , lose their value through repetition , i apologize again now from my heart and ask the forgiveness of those who have been so shamefully harmed			0
" the report named 11 priests who had pleaded guilty to or were convicted of sexual assaults on children			0
of the other 35 , it gave pseudonyms to 33 of them and redacted the names of two			0
the report shot down the notion that church leadership was unaware of the problem			0
" the @entity1 of @entity2 and other @entity4 authorities have repeatedly claimed to have been , prior to the late 1990s , ' on a learning curve ' in relation to the matter , " it said			0
however , it said @entity110 , @entity109 and @entity108 had information on complaints against at least 17 priests when the @entity1 took out insurance in 1987 to cover future compensation claims and lawsuits related to sexual abuse allegations			2
" the taking out of insurance was an act proving knowledge of child sexual abuse as a potential major cost to the @entity1 and is inconsistent with the view that @entity194 officials were still ' on a learning curve ' at a much later date , or were lacking in an appreciation of the phenomenon of clerical child sex abuse , " it said			2
the report also said church officials perpetuated the problem by ignoring allegations and in some cases simply moved an alleged abuser on to another parish -- leaving him free to abuse another group of children			1
thursday 's findings follow a report that came out in may , detailing allegations of child abuse in various institutions across @entity5 from the 1940s to the present			1
though both reports deal with child abuse , they are not related , having been written by two separate commissions investigating two different subjects			1
the may report looked at child abuse in lay institutions , including reformatories , hospitals , orphanages , children 's homes and industrial schools across the country			1
some of those institutions were linked to religious orders , but none were strictly religious schools			1
speaking last month after the @entity235 cleared the way for thursday 's report to be made public , @entity5 justice minister @entity48 said he was pleased the information would not be kept private			1
" i have always made it clear that i have been anxious to put the report into the public domain as quickly as possible , while at the same time not wishing to do anything which would prejudice the chances of any of the people involved in these evil deeds being brought to justice , " @entity48 said in a statement			0
@entity0 's @entity248 contributed to this report .			0

new report examines abuse abuse between january 1975 and may 2004
