-- @entity2 police on monday found an explosive package at the @entity4 in @entity5 , the second time in as many weeks that embassies there have received explosives through the mail			1
the parcel did not explode , and authorities hope that it will provide information that will help in their investigation			2
police also responded to other reports of suspicious packages at the @entity18 and @entity19 embassies in @entity5 and possibly other embassies as well on monday			2
but only the @entity22 embassy package contained an explosive , according to @entity23 , the chief of police in @entity5			1
" the alarm system has worked , " @entity23 said			1
" since this morning , all the embassies that had a suspected package alerted the police in enough time to determine whether the packages were dangerous and prevent any injuries			2
" late last week , an anarchist group claimed credit for a pair of mail bombings thursday at embassies in @entity5 , vowing in messages that it plans more such acts to " destroy the systems of domination , " the state - run @entity33 news agency reported			1
police said that the @entity45 of @entity46 -- an offshoot of the @entity48 , or @entity48 -- claimed responsibility for attacks at the @entity52 and @entity53 embassies			1
@entity23 said that monday 's packages , which included a note from the @entity48 , were " certainly related " to the ones last week			0
computer - written notes were sent in small boxes along with the earlier package bombs , according to @entity33			0
the messages read : " we have decided to make our voices heard again , in words and deeds			0
we will destroy the system of domination			0
" the notes also referenced @entity67 , who was shot dead last march while protesting in @entity68			0
the 35 - year - old has since become a martyr for the international anarchist movement , particularly groups in @entity22 , @entity2 and @entity73			1
formed in 1945 , @entity48 had seen a " a slow but constant increase " of supporters in recent years , said the website of an umbrella group , @entity77			0
the @entity2 organization aims for " radical change " in support of " oppressed and exploited peoples , " doing so with opposition to political powers and even the @entity85 , the website said			2
there was no warning before a @entity52 - born , 53 - year - old mailroom worker was seriously hurt by an explosion while opening a package at the @entity91 , according to police and the @entity52 @entity93 in @entity94			0
one person was taken to a hospital when the second bomb exploded shortly afterward at the @entity99 , police said			0
@entity2 foreign minister @entity100 called the attacks " a serious threat against foreign embassies in @entity5			1
" he said that authorities were checking all embassies in @entity5 and @entity2 embassies aboard for suspicious packages			1
" we should avoid being alarmist , " @entity100 said			0
@entity2 interior minister @entity109 said the incident is similar to a wave of letter bombs sent last month by an anarchist group based in @entity22 and claimed the bombs came from there			1
but @entity22 officials disputed the notion that anyone in their country was involved in the blasts			2
" there is no evidence that the bombs originated in @entity22 , " @entity93 spokesman @entity121 said			1
in addition to the @entity52 and @entity53 blasts , a " suspicious package " was found at the @entity127 in the @entity2 capital , police said , but it turned out not to be dangerous			1
there were also false alarms at the @entity134 and @entity135 embassies			0
in november , police discovered 14 parcel bombs emanating from @entity22 , most of which were sent to various embassies in @entity68			1
police intercepted and destroyed most of them in controlled explosions , but a woman at a courier office was wounded by one of the devices and another device exploded in the courtyard of the @entity91			0
two men accused of participating in the bombings were remanded into custody after they were arrested in @entity68 in possession of two parcel bombs , glock pistols , a bulletproof vest and a wig			2
@entity158 , 22 , and @entity159 , 24 , were also in possession of a delivery slip for another parcel containing an explosive device that had been delivered to a courier service and was addressed to the @entity165 , police said			2
@entity167 spokesman maj. @entity166 called the two suspects " important members of a terrorist group			0
" before the attacks , @entity158 already faced an arrest warrant alleging his membership in an illegal organization called the @entity175			0
@entity22 authorities stressed that they believed the wave of letter bombs in november was the work of a home - grown @entity22 terrorist group that does not have ties to international organizations like @entity184			1
@entity0 's @entity185 contributed to this report .			0
