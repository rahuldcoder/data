full of mysterious nooks and crannies as well as grand spaces , the @entity28 attracts around two million visitors a year , according to the @entity10 in @entity14 , the organization that looks after the complex			1
now a sustainable tourism effort from the @entity10 , the @entity35 and others is taking the @entity10 into the 21st century , using technology to bring previously hidden areas of the complex to light			1
entitled " @entity28 , " the project aims to expand the site for tourists , with an app. it will allow visitors to virtually explore delicate , closed - off areas on their iphones , or on specially designed portable electronic tablets , as well as opening up new routes to related areas outside the complex			1
" it is a site that gets many visitors , we can say that it 's a major tourist destination , " said @entity52 , director of the @entity10			2
" for many years now , we have worked with a model that limits access to a certain number of visitors per day , " she explained , saying " @entity28 , " is designed to further take the pressure off " fragile zones			0
" hidden areas that the application will bring to light include an underground space beneath the palace of the holy roman emperor @entity68 , as well as storage areas , towers and pavilions , according to @entity72 , program director for @entity74 , @entity14 , and @entity75 at the @entity35			1
" ( visitors will ) be able to see images and video ( on their iphones ) and get all kinds of information about these specific sites that are not open , " she said			0
" they are not able to walk down the stairs into the silos for example , but they can be close to them and get a lot of information , " she continued			0
the app is currently being developed and augmented reality features have not been ruled out , said @entity72			2
the first phase of information - gathering for the application , namely photographing the various sites , is being undertaken , according to @entity52			2
they are aiming to have the app ready for the public by summer 2012			0
virtual visitor experiences are an increasingly popular way of making delicate historic monuments accessible , said @entity72			0
" once the technology began to improve , then we started looking at this as a way of promoting knowledge and caring for a building without trampling all over it , " she said			0
but it 's not all virtual work : the @entity35 is also contributing $ 300,000 to the conservation of the @entity112 , an elaborate mid- 14th century chapel built during the reign of @entity115 the conservation effort will include work on the roof , carved wood ceiling and decorative plaster work and will be incorporated into the " @entity28 " application			2
" it 's a very important part of the @entity10 , for its symbolic value being a part of the oldest area of the complex , " explained @entity52			1
it is part of a long - term plan of conservation works to other fragile areas of the complex that , she hopes , will make more and more of it accessible to visitors -- and continue to pique their interest in it .			1
