the @entity7 @entity6 chartered a private plane last september to travel from @entity9 to @entity10 , where she attended an official event			1

under federal law and @entity1 rules , the cost of a trip that includes official and campaign stops must often be prorated between @entity1 and campaign accounts			2
however , if the campaign activity is " incidental " to the official trip , the expense does n't need to be split up			0
in this case , @entity0 's @entity1 office picked up the whole cost of the trip			1
asked wednesday about the trip , @entity0 's @entity1 spokesman , @entity27 , said in a statement : " sen. @entity0 was invited to an official evening event in @entity10			1
she was traveling back to @entity33 through @entity12 , and a fundraiser in @entity12 was added to her schedule , " he said			0
" out of an abundance of caution in case there was a cost allocation error connected to this flight , the @entity1 will be reimbursed for the ( @entity10 to @entity12 ) flight			2
" a @entity1 aide said that because @entity0 was already going to be in @entity12 , the office considered the fundraiser incidental and not an expense that had to be partially covered by the campaign			2
the reimbursement comes just one day after @entity4 learned that the vulnerable @entity7 @entity6 used government money last november to charter a private plane to travel to a campaign fundraiser , in violation of federal law			1
@entity0 spent more than $ 3,200 in taxpayer money to fly 400 miles round trip from @entity9 to @entity56 , @entity7 , where she attended a $ 40 - per person fundraising lunch with hundreds of women , according to @entity1 records and @entity0 campaign information			1

@entity0 's campaign spokesman , @entity64 , said in a statement monday that the charter company mistakenly billed @entity0 's @entity1 office instead of her re-election campaign			1
@entity64 said the campaign noticed the error a few weeks ago and asked the company to refund the @entity1 office and bill the campaign , which the company did			0
@entity64 said @entity0 's re-election campaign paid for the flight august 4 , almost nine months after the november 8 trip			1
" we take our finances very seriously and are glad we caught the vendor 's mistake and were able to rectify the matter as soon as possible , " @entity64 said			0
the campaign did n't notice the mistake until july 29			0
two days later , on july 31 , @entity85 published a story showing that @entity0 was one of the @entity1 's most frequent fliers , spending $ 47,000 last year on taxpayer - funded charter flights			2
