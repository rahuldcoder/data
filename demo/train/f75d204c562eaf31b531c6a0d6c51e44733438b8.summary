-- it 's been quite some time since someone made fun of me for being from @entity5			1
but the gov. @entity7 bridge scandal is bringing the old @entity9 stereotypes back into play			2
" @entity5 smells bad , " " @entity5 drivers are the worst ! " and , quite possibly the most inaccurate accusation , " @entity5 made @entity13 and @entity14 ! " ( not ours ! they 're both from @entity16			1
) we 're not a boorish population living in an industrial wasteland			2
the same old disparaging remarks have made @entity22 thick - skinned underdogs			2
i 'm convinced the @entity24 was built to keep outsiders out , because the concrete blight along many stretches shows no evidence of why @entity5 is called the @entity29			1
once you get off on any exit , you will see @entity5 is so much more than what most saw in the " @entity35 " introduction			1
i 'm here to clear the air : @entity5 is one of the most underestimated states in the country			1
do n't knock it until you 've traveled it			2
want to give it a try ? here are six spots to check out from north to south			2
@entity46 go on a food tour of diverse @entity46			1
you 'll find authentic and affordable @entity50 food at @entity51 , a savory crepe at @entity55 restaurant @entity53 's , new @entity57 food using seasonal , local ingredients at @entity59 , and do n't miss @entity60 and @entity61 's for brunch ( three words : croissant @entity55 toast )			1
once you 've sufficiently indulged , catch a movie at the @entity67 , a not - for - profit historic landmark built in 1929 that has hosted the likes of @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 and , more recently , the @entity57 rock band @entity75			2
cool , right ? if you want to get in touch with mother nature in this densely populated area , head north for a hike or bike ride in beautiful @entity82 , a historic national landmark , and one of my favorite places in the world			1
@entity88 , @entity5 hungry after the hiking and biking ? luckily you 're minutes away from some of the best @entity93 food in the tri-state area in @entity88			1
@entity95 over to @entity96 , the longest commercial avenue in @entity5 , and go for a nice long urban stroll with ample people - watching , shopping and eats from @entity101 to @entity50 to @entity102 or @entity103			1
having trouble deciding ? start stretching your stomach at @entity107 , an @entity109 cafe and bakery where magical dulce de leche pastries and beef , chicken , ham , cheese or spinach empanadas are made with mucho amor			2
@entity117 if you 're looking for a mix of history , an art scene and tree - lined streets , then you 're hankering for @entity117			1
take a walking tour of @entity126 's @entity125 campus , which dates to 1754			2
it 's well worth it			0
as for art , you 'll want to head over to the @entity130 , which houses more than 72,000 works of art. after soaking in all that art and culture , stop for a treat			0
now , while i 've heard the @entity137 is where " the party is at " for their gelatos , i can only vouch for @entity141 on @entity142			0
they 're famous for their blend - ins , way before a chain ice cream shop became popular for it			0
since you 're already on @entity142 , you might as well shop			0
bookstores , dining spots and gift shops , oh my ! @entity152 now that you 're an unofficial @entity153 , you 'll want to get in your car and drive ( it 's what we do ) to @entity152 , along the banks of the @entity159			1
rolling hills , green fields and scenic views support the state 's lush moniker			0
if you 're there anywhere from may to september , slap on some sunscreen and go for a gentle tube ride or some rafting			0
for those looking for some imported furniture or home decor from @entity174 , go to two buttons , owned by the author of " @entity177 , " @entity178 , and her husband			0
@entity180 now , as the locals say , we 're " going down the shore			1
" out - of - towners have a stale notion of caked layers of fake tanning spray and so - called guidos galore along the @entity189 , thanks to the @entity192 show			0
the state 's coast is actually defined by its historic boardwalks , arcades and amusement parks thick with nostalgia			0
when i want to stay close to the tri-state area but still want to feel like i went on a mini-getaway , i go to @entity180			1
i love it 's old - timey charm , boardwalk , lounges and restaurants , and , of course , beaches			0
it never gets completely packed with people , so you 'll find some peace and quiet			0
if you 're a @entity213 fan ( of course you are , who is n't ! ? ) , you should make it a point to go to the historic @entity218 , where he got his start			0
not far is @entity221 , another no - frills but fun music venue and vintage bowling alley			0
@entity225 finally , for a real getaway , keep driving south until you reach the southern tip of @entity5 and charming and quaint @entity228 , which stakes a claim as the nation 's oldest seaside resort			1
a @entity233 , @entity225 is filled with lovely @entity235 homes			0
you can stroll on the boardwalk , visit the historic @entity237 , go whale or dolphin watching or go wine tasting at the @entity241			0
embrace your inner @entity5 girl and enjoy some of the @entity29 's finer things before the rest of the out - of - towners catch on			1
but if you do n't , it 's no skin off our back			0

@entity5 is the butt of jokes once again , thanks to its *governor*
but from @entity117 to @entity180 , @entity5 is for travelers
try *ethnic* food in @entity46 ; *explore* nature in @entity152
