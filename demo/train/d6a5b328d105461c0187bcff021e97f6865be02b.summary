-- perhaps it 's the inherently soul - crushing nature of the holiday season , but it seems many of our readers have been beset by quandaries of late			0
so , being the utterly benevolent souls that we are , we 're choosing to devote this week 's column to more reader questions			1
this week we tackle @entity11 friend collectors and the eternal query : to tweet or not to tweet ? @entity14 , @entity13 , everyone			1
most times when i get a friend request or if someone accepts mine , i initiate a " thanks for the friend ( request / accept ) " in a private message , plus a quick update -- one or two lines max. most of the time i receive something similar in return			1
with some friends this leads to more conversation , sometimes not , but either way at least we communicated			0
every once in a while , i '' ll initiate a message and the new " friend " does n't bother to respond			1
i guess i 'm not sure what to make of it			0
i see their activity on @entity11 so i know they have signed in but they never responded back			1
if we 're supposed to be " friends " a quick " hello " and maybe an update would seem good manners			1
i have had different friends suggest different meanings : 1			0
if they have not responded after several weeks and you see them active , just " unfriend " them because they were just " collecting " you anyway			0
2 do n't private message them , post on their wall			1
many people do n't like the @entity63 stuff -- too creepy			2
( i 've posted on their wall as well with about the same rate of return communication )			0
who cares ? you do n't want to talk to those people anyway ( i guess that returns me to option 1 but that approach seems rather harsh )			2
what do you think is the correct approach ? - @entity73 assuming that you are not , in fact , clicking obsessively through your new friend 's @entity75 , fastidiously poring over years 2005 - 2011 and shooting off private messages that amorously detail the imagined flick of her tongue as she enjoyed a melting cone of pistachio sherbet on june 3 , 2006 , it sounds like you 've been suffering some serious abuse at the hands of " @entity87			2
" ( that 's a term both similar and many ways vastly different from the 1999 flick starring @entity91 , which your new friend added to her favorite films in early 2007 )			2
the friend collector is a wily , often drunk beast that lurks within all of us , threatening to rise up and assume our form during a particularly vigorous bout of @entity11 / memory lane - walking / power - houring			1
the phenomenon was admittedly less common back in the days when we actually had to type a remembered acquaintance 's name into the search bar , squinting through the dust of childhood and a veil of tequila to remember his / her surname			0
but a while back @entity11 added that pesky " people you may know " feature , impelling us to add childhood friends , half - remembered college classmates and random guys in indie bands ( or what i like to call " future ex-boyfriends " ) with wild abandon			1
many times , we add such people not because we particularly want to talk to them , but merely because we 're afflicted with the oh - so itch - able question , " i wonder what so - and - so is doing now , " and we just have to scratch			2
and you know what happens when you scratch too hard : you draw blood			0
and in this case , that blood is yours , in that you 're getting hurt when your fake pal shuns your friendly -- non-creepy , non-murderous , right ? -- advances			2
so let 's all take a vow , as we wander myopically into the @entity137 : thou shalt not friend collect			2
even if our good friend @entity140 makes a strong case for it at 3 a.m. oh , and to answer your question : go ahead and unfriend the phony			2
she 'll probably just attempt to friend you again , wholly unaware that she has already done so			2
like a true criminal , a @entity148 always returns to the scene of the crime			0
i am a writer and i love sarcasm			0
my work is posted on @entity155 ( @entity156 , @entity157 ) but i would like to get it noticed -- i do n't think anyone reads it			1
how could i get my work noticed ? a writer friend told me to @entity162 whenever i 'm published			1
who the heck is going to go on my @entity162 account ? i 'm a 58 - year - old mom in the suburbs -- please			1
plus i do n't have a @entity162 account			1
- to tweet or not to @entity162 ? ok , so just because you 're a 58 - year - old mom in the suburbs , that means no one cares what the hell you have to say ? i would use a word synonymous with ( and less idiotic than ) " baloney " here if this were n't @entity0 , but , yeah , there you have it			1
ever heard of @entity179 ? well , he 's a 70 - something - year - old man who has nearly 3 million people in his thrall daily via the @entity162 account @ sh * tmydadsays			1
granted , the @entity162 account is not run by @entity179 himself but by his son @entity189 , but regardless , @entity179 's pearls of weirdness and wisdom have spawned a book and a tv series			1
but here 's where you differ from @entity179 : you 're the writer here			0
you 're the one creating content that you think others should see ( unless you have some kind of weird obsession with corgis in @entity201 sweaters , in which case your kids are about to cash it in big time ) and you need to be the one to get it out there			0
so listen to your writer friend : start a @entity162 account , but do so in a tactical way			1
do n't just sign up and start tweeting links to your articles into the ether			0
search for other writers whom you admire -- and work with on @entity155 -- and follow them posthaste			1
read what they have to say , engage in conversations and post links to articles and stories that both you and your followers can appreciate			0
then , once you 've built up a relationship with this online network of people -- who will see you as much more than a suburban mom ( not that there 's anything wrong with that ) -- add your own work into the mix. since people will already trust you and your judgment , they will be much more willing to retweet your stories and thereby score you a much wider audience than you would have had out there , rockin ' the suburbs			0
and , who knows , if your work is good , maybe you , too , can score a book / tv deal			0
if not , well , then go ahead and use my corgis in @entity201 sweaters idea			0
that one is solid gold .			0

have a @entity11 friend who does n't respond to your posts ? they 're likely a " friend collector "
many friend collectors send requests out of curiosity and *nosiness*
should writers promote their work on @entity162 ? yes , but they must do so in a tactical way
