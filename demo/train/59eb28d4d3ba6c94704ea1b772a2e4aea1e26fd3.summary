-- " we do n't really care what the federal government wants to call us , " @entity0 was saying the other afternoon			0
" we know that we 're a good place			0
" @entity0 is the executive director of the convention and visitors bureau in @entity7 , @entity8 , and we were discussing what has happened to the little airport with the big problem			1
the problem was never the airport itself			0
by all accounts , @entity14 , serving @entity7 and the surrounding area in northwest @entity8 , northeast @entity16 , eastern @entity17 and far southern @entity18 , is a fine facility			1
but the three - letter identifier -- the three capitalized letters that appear on baggage - claim tags , that are used nationwide to refer to the @entity7 airport , that pilots and air - traffic controllers use to designate @entity7 -- has long been a headache for the town			1
every city , in this era of marketing and branding , likes to present itself as something special -- a destination that is sparkling and inviting , a wonderful place for families to settle in , or for businesses to set up shop			0
so , to the dismay of @entity7 , it has not been especially helpful that , for as long as there has been commercial air travel into the town , travelers have glanced at the tags on their checked baggage and have noticed that the official designator for the town is : @entity14 yep			1
generations ago , federal aviation regulators gave @entity7 that identifier			2
it was a shortened version of " @entity56			0
" that was in the years before those three letters took on a somewhat unfortunate tone			0
@entity60 was @entity60 ; @entity61 in @entity62 was @entity61 ; @entity63 in @entity64 was @entity65 ; @entity7 was @entity14			1
no city , no airport , wants to be connected to those letters			2
it 's not a great calling card , not an ideal howdy - do to the world beyond the town 's borders			2
many people find the word ( however you spell it ) offensive -- and if you , by chance , think the word is not very nice , try to consider how the proud citizens of @entity7 have felt			2
on two occasions -- in the 1980s , and again at the beginning of this century -- @entity7 earnestly and formally petitioned the @entity85 to change the letters			1
the word just was n't doing the town any good			0
on both occasions , nothing happened			0
i covered @entity7 's second attempt to get rid of @entity14 ; a spokeswoman for the @entity85 at the time signaled to me that the town 's odds of getting three new letters were slim			1
the @entity7 airport director at the time told me the @entity85 informed him that the only reason it would change a three - letter identifier was for safety considerations			1
he conceded that he did n't know how @entity14 could be construed as a safety issue , " unless pilots are laughing so hard when they hear it that it distracts them from doing their job			1
" the reason i got back in touch with @entity7 's leaders last week is that recently the federal government has shown it will speedily get involved in aviation - related issues when it wants to			1
@entity111 stepped in to ease air - traffic delays caused by federal spending cuts ; the @entity114 and the @entity115 , to put travelers ' minds at ease , backed off on its plan to allow passengers to bring small knives onto planes			0
so i wondered if @entity7 was still trying to persuade the government to allow it to get rid of those three dreaded letters " we decided to go completely the other way , " said @entity125 , president of the airport 's board of trustees			1
" the @entity85 was n't going to change it , so it was n't going to do us any good to whine about it			1
" thus , the town made a bold decision : it would embrace the @entity14 designator			1
it would make it part of @entity7 's charm -- a whimsical part of the civic personality			1
t - shirts were printed up with those three capital letters on the front ; hats and postcards and coffee mugs and balsa - wood airplanes and silver - wing pins were manufactured , all jauntily bearing the letters			1
on i - 29 between @entity7 and @entity152 , @entity16 , a big billboard was rented , displaying , in huge type , those letters , as a way to lure passengers to the airport in @entity8 instead of the one in @entity16			1
" in warm weather , you can walk around @entity7 and see people wearing the t - shirts all the time , " @entity125 said			1
" at our coffee shop in the airport , between one - third and one - half of net revenues come from the sale of items with those three letters on them			2
" the city -- in the words of tourism director @entity0 -- has " very successfully made lemonade out of some lemons			1
our treating the situation with good humor has emblemized the spirit of @entity7 -- one of grit and determination , something no label from the government can change			2
" the airport commission 's @entity125 said that " it 's better to be memorable than to have three initials no one can really recall			2
" in fact , in the spirit of all this , the town ended up renaming the official website for the airport ; it is now www.flysux.com			0
and who , on a national scale , can argue with that message ? these days , with overcrowded planes , long security lines and hefty fees to check baggage , flying often really does ... well , you know			0
what will @entity7 do about the letters in future years ? it could once have sought counsel from two of the most famous people ever born there : twin sisters @entity205 ( @entity209 ) and @entity210 ( @entity211 ) , who left @entity7 to become the two most renowned newspaper advice columnists in history			2
but both have passed away , and are no longer available for commiseration			0
so the town is on its own			0
the mayor , @entity217 , a lifelong resident , told me that he wants the world to know that @entity7 does n't do what those three letters on the baggage tags says			2
it is , he said , a great place to live , " and we 're thankful for that			0
" he sends emphatic word to potential visitors that they will be warmly welcomed : " absolutely			0
we 'd love to have them			0
" and , " the mayor said with a laugh , " they can buy a t - shirt			0
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity236 .			0

@entity236 : the *acronym* for @entity7 's airport has long been a headache
@entity236 : the city tried to change it , but @entity85 would only act if it was a safety issue
so the city " very successfully made lemonade out of lemons "
@entity236 : now you can buy @entity14 postcards and mugs and proudly wear sux t - shirts
