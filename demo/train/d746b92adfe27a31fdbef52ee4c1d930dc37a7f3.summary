@entity0 -- @entity2 could have spent this weekend at @entity3 , being regaled by some 83,000 fans as a member of the @entity6			1
instead , he chose to keep his day job , working on the railroad			1
no spotlights , no television cameras , no adoring throngs			0
the only waves that he could get -- seconds of attention , in between long stretches of quiet -- will be from kids standing alongside the tracks , asking the unnamed engineer to pull the horn			0
and he 's not complaining			0
" that was always my childhood dream , " said @entity2 of playing pro football			1
" driving transit was always my second childhood dream			0
" for months , the @entity28 , @entity29 , resident -- like millions of @entity30 -- was living more of a nightmare , unemployed and struggling to get by			0
a star safety at @entity33 , he had three stints over the past two seasons in the @entity36 with the @entity37 and twice the @entity6			1
but each time , @entity2 had been released			1
for someone who , for years , had lived and breathed football , rejection was not easy			0
what was even harder , he said , was living without the paycheck and without any clear prospect that @entity36 stardom and dollars were in his future			1
what he was certain about , though , was family			2
the 5 - foot - 10 , 210 - pound @entity2 was in the prime of his life healthwise , but not bringing home any income			1
his father disabled and unable to work , his mother was the only family member with a regular paycheck			2
@entity2 said he was used to getting such support , emotionally as much as economically			1
his parents had cheered him while he played football , encouraged him to think of life after football , took care of him			0
when his sister died after contracting @entity66 virus while he was in college at @entity68 , his mother held off on telling him until he played a key spring football game			0
she , his father , his grandmother and other family members were always like that : thinking and taking care of everyone else , all while keeping their heads up , said @entity2			1
his sister 's loss especially , he said , made him realize that while football was a game , family was everything			2
" they were there for me , when i went through some of the lowest times of my life , " @entity2 said			1
" and i needed to be there for them , also			0
" so he was thrilled when he recently got a full - time job with @entity91 , a position that allowed him to run trains around the country and also bring home regular income and benefits to help support his family			1
but his suddenly stable life got turned upside down tuesday , when his agent called to tell him about the @entity6 offer			1
@entity2 was off and at home , his father resting in bed			2
his agent told him the 9 - 3 team wanted him , right away			2
could he make a 2 o'clock flight ? not , said @entity2 , without checking with his new employer first			2
" my heart started racing , i started sweating immediately , " he recalled			0
" this is not happening to me			0
i 'd just got this new job , and i do n't want to let them down ( so they think ) every time i get a phone call , i 'm going to run away			0
" he 'd learned that professional football jobs were fleeting			0
he knew his railroad job was not as glamorous , it might not pay as much , but it was stable and allowed him to help his family long - term			1
so , before he 'd even found out from @entity91 if he could take a leave of absence ( he later learned that he could have ) , @entity2 made up his mind			1
" i just felt that the best decision at that time , for me , was to keep my job , " @entity2 said			1
" because the economy is so bad right now , jobs are very scarce			0
once you have a good job like this , i ( thought ) that i should just keep it			0
" money , fame , and the thrill of competition on the gridiron are great			0
and @entity2 says that he has n't closed the door on pro football totally , not if the time is right			2
but he said that he 's comfortable with his decision to stay off the sidelines and stay on the tracks			0
doing so will be different than battling the @entity139 on sunday , but @entity2 believes he will still get a rush and he 'll still have the support of family and " fans			1
" " you have families that go outside in their yards or go by the tracks , and just wave at the conductors and engineers as they are riding by -- that feeling is really good , " said @entity2			2
" like the experience in the @entity36 , you still have fans out there			2

@entity2 is a new employee with @entity91 railroad
on tuesday , the @entity6 offered to fly him so he could join the team
@entity2 turned down the @entity6 ' offer , choosing a stable job near his family
