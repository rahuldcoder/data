@entity0 -- it has been more than two weeks since @entity3 hit the @entity4 , yet many still remain without power			1
two residents of @entity0 's @entity8 are going to court declaring , in effect , they 've had enough			1

although the suit , which does not seeks specific damages but calls on the court to award " a sum to be determined at trial , " was filed by two individuals , @entity17 entered the claim as a class - action , which would allow other residents to join as plaintiffs			1

the lawsuit , which was filed in state court , came the same day that @entity0 gov. @entity110 bluntly criticized @entity14 and called for its overhaul at a press conference			0
" @entity14 has been beyond repair for a long , long time , " @entity110 said on tuesday , " i believe it needs to be overhauled and you need a new system			0
