-- @entity2 star pitcher @entity1 is only 25			1
he just pitched a perfect 24 - 0 season with a 1.27 era			0
for non baseball fans , that 's unbelievable form			0
it 's thanks to this form that he 's signed a seven - year , $ 155 million contract with the famous @entity11 -- a young player with the best years of his career ahead of him			2
but some @entity15 baseball watchers are skeptical			1
the reason ? @entity1 has thrown a worryingly high number of pitches			2
according to @entity20 's @entity19 , @entity1 has thrown more innings at a young age than anybody in the major leagues in few decades			2
as a pro , the @entity2 star had thrown 1,315 innings by age 24 , a number unrivaled by virtually any young player today			0
even as a high schooler @entity1 was a powerhouse : during @entity34 's @entity33 he set a national record with an astonishing 742 pitches in 6 games			1
unlike in @entity15 baseball , where pitchers are often warned that throwing too many times leads to early injury , @entity1 has played for years in a @entity2 sporting culture that values repetition as a way to achieve perfection			1
" the [ @entity2 ] philosophy is repetition , hard work : if i put in more , it 's going to make a better pitcher and it 's going to take care of everything , " explained @entity34 - based pitching instructor @entity49 , to @entity50			1
" it 's not in my opinion always focused properly , and the body does need recovery time , " he added			0
today , few @entity15 pitchers exceed 100 pitches in a game			2
yet in a recent game in @entity34 , @entity1 threw 160 pitches - and topped it off with another 15 pitches the very next day			1
@entity11 general manager @entity66 acknowledged in a conference call with reporters there were " concerns " about those two games			1
" but with his age , his talent and the scouting assessment , and with the pitching market the way it is , we were willing to take the risk , " he said			0
reaction on social media was divided			0
" @entity11 overpaid for @entity1 1300 + innings and he 's only 24			1
that 's got @entity87 written all over it , " wrote @entity83 user @ @entity84 , referencing the nickname for the elbow surgery first undergone by former major league pitcher @entity87			0
" @entity1 's usage is n't that much different than prospects or even major league pitchers of similar pedigree and age			2
he will be fine , " argued @entity83 user @ bkblades			0
in the end , it 's clear @entity1 is ready to prove his own worth			0
" i can not speak @entity100 , but i would like to appeal with my performance , " @entity1 told reporters in @entity34 thursday			1
" i hope i can perform what i have built up so far on the pitcher 's mound			0

@entity11 ' newest pitcher @entity1 , 25 , is a star pitcher in @entity34
@entity15 baseball watchers are worried he has already *overused* his *arm*
@entity11 managers say they are *aware* of concerns , but " willing to take the risk "
