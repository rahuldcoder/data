-- since " the @entity2 , " " @entity3 " and " @entity4 , " it 's been impossible to see a camcorder movie without steeling yourself for some monstrous horror lurking just offscreen			1
" @entity20 " is supposed to be a comedy , but parents with teenagers -- or parents with kids who may one day turn into teenagers -- will regard it with much the same mixture of dread and terror			1
it 's @entity22 ' 17th birthday			1
@entity23 have recklessly elected to take off for the weekend			0
sure , they know he 'll probably have friends over , but they trust him to use his common sense , and anyway , he does n't have that many friends			0
but they reckon without the influence of his determined buddy @entity30 , who puts all his considerable social networking skills to promoting what turns out to be the ultimate house party			1
beer will be chugged , tequila slammed , pills popped ( cherries too ) , furnishings trashed , cars crashed , there will be fire , swat teams and loud noise late into the night			0
oh yes , my friends , the peace will be disturbed ! there 's nothing new about any of this -- the wild party is firmly entrenched in youths ' rites of passage in the movies and in high school lore across the land			1
in my day , it was @entity58 turning his home into a brothel and getting on the wrong side of @entity62			0
now , it 's @entity64 orchestrating a rave in his backyard and stupidly ripping off a frazzled drug dealer by the name of @entity69			1
( kids , if you take away just one lesson from this movie , let it be this : there 's no percentage in ripping off your dealer			2
) still , it seems to me @entity58 was at least respectful of those working girls			0
to @entity22 and the gangsta - mouthed @entity30 ( @entity85 ) , even their classmates are " hos " and " b * tches			0
" if this movie has it right , today 's teen culture is about what you would expect from a demographic brainwashed on a junk media diet of rap , pornography and reality tv			2
please note , i said " if			0
" " @entity102 " seems almost quaint in comparison -- and a whole lot funnier , in my opinion			2
not that there 's any point in sermonizing about such a self - consciously anarchic celebration of adolescent hedonism			2
there 's not much to it , but at least there 's a trace of punk rebellion in the orgy of destruction visited on a comfortably middle - class suburban home -- even if the coda dubiously suggests that this could be the shortcut to social status and parental respect			1
yeah , as my kid would say , right			0
directed by newcomer @entity120 from what must have been a stick - thin screenplay , " @entity20 " loses more than it gains from the " videography " gambit			1
it is indifferently acted and in too much of a rush for quick hits to establish anything like the lull and swell of a real rave -- there 's no undertow , no rapture , just a randomized string of highs and lows			1
even the hangover is shortchanged ( despite a producer credit for " @entity141 " director @entity140 )			0
that 's not to say there are n't at least a few outrageous gags , @entity146 moments to share , but mostly this looks like exactly what it is : a wasted opportunity .			0

*reviewer* @entity151 : " @entity20 " loses more than it gains from the " videography " gambit
there 's nothing new here -- the wild party is *ingrained* in youths ' rites of passage , he says
