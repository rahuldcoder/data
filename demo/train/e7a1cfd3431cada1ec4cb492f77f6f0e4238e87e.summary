@entity0 -- shortly after becoming the nation 's 112th @entity3 justice , @entity5 by tradition was presented with a silver cup , engraved with the names of those who preceded her in that particular seat			1
speaking tuesday evening before an audience at a synagogue here , @entity5 recalled one name standing out in her mind : @entity17 , the nation 's first @entity19 justice			1
" his nomination was controversial , and it took some courage for the president to name him to the bench , " she said			2
" he later faced prejudice on the bench			2
justice ( @entity31 ) @entity30 would turn his back on @entity17 when he spoke from the bench , and refused to shake his hand or have his picture taken with him			1
" ninety - five years and three justices removed in that seat she now occupies , @entity5 said her @entity19 heritage barely attracted attention when she was nominated last year			1
" there are three @entity19 on the court , but nobody talks about that			1
it does n't matter , times have changed , " she said			2
@entity5 addressed a mostly @entity19 audience of @entity49 , celebrating its 90th anniversary			1
she was asked if her faith affected how she approaches certain cases , especially those involving religion			2
a case the court will hear early next month involves the @entity59 's decision to currently list only @entity60 as the place of birth on @entity64 or @entity65 passports , deliberately leaving out the country name in that disputed region			2
an @entity64 couple sued the government , and the issue is whether courts can intervene to overturn such executive and diplomatic decisions			0
" i do n't think the fact i 'm @entity19 will matter with respect to the @entity60 passport case , and it should n't , " she said			1
" anyone who comes before the court should expect impartial justice , and getting the same kind of treatment			2
" @entity5 deflected suggestions the court 's religious makeup -- three @entity19 and six @entity85 -- would somehow undermine public confidence			1
" it sometimes requires effort to put your feelings aside , " she said			0
" we are all the sum of our experiences , but we ( justices ) all understand the role of the judge is to step back from any personal proclivities and look just at interpreting the law			1
" the 51 - year - old justice noted her colleagues also share other things in common : all attended either @entity102 or @entity103 law schools , and five , including @entity5 , come from the @entity105 area			1
the justice was introduced at the @entity0 event by sen. @entity108 , @entity109 , a longtime member of @entity49			1
@entity108 also sits on the @entity110 , which held confirmation hearings for @entity5 last year			1
@entity5 grew up in the west side of @entity113 , and describes her family 's religious journey as " wandering @entity19			1
" " my mother never really found a rabbi she liked , so we joined several synagogues when i was growing up : conservative , reform , modern @entity122			0
" the family settled on the @entity124 , where @entity5 was a pioneer of sorts , becoming the first girl to have a bat mitzvah at the @entity130 facility			1
she was the one who insisted on it , after her older brother had his bar mitzvah			0
" it was the great @entity19 experience of my youth , " she remembered			1
" it was a completely natural thing " to want to have a bat mitzvah			0
" i had to negotiate myself with @entity140 ( @entity139 ) @entity138 , " who had never before performed the coming - of - age rite with a 12 - year - old girl			0
compromises were made at the modern @entity122 synagogue : her ceremony took place on a friday night in may 1973 , not the usual saturday mornings boys enjoyed			0
the star student at her @entity19 school read from the @entity151			1
" it was good , not great , " she said of the ceremony			0
" it was not exactly what my brother had done , which is what i wanted			0
but the experience shaped my life , negotiating with @entity138			2
it was a formative experience , and i guess i 've always been a striver			0
" that drive led her to the job that she says " is now my life 's work , " a place she expects to stay for some time			1
despite never having been a judge before , @entity5 said the transition has been in some ways easier than she expected			1
" was i nervous , sure , " she said of her first days on the bench			0
" but then i just starting speaking ( during oral arguments ) and i noticed , oh look , words are coming out of my mouth , and i think i 'm making sense			0
" her colleagues too , she said , have been enormously supportive , and have even opened new worlds for her			0
she recalled paying a courtesy call on sen. @entity182 , @entity183 , shortly after her nomination to the court by president @entity186 in may 2010			0
@entity182 asked her about gun rights , and remarked she may not realize how important the issue is to some @entity189 , especially in his home state			0
she admitted never having owned or fired a gun before			0
" but i told the senator if i was fortunate enough to be confirmed , i would go hunting with @entity194			0
" and she has , joining her conservative colleague on an excursion to a @entity198 - area shooting range and on several hunting trips , until now never reported			0
her host at the synagogue event was surprised			0
" you 're @entity19 , " deadpanned rabbi @entity202			2
" yeah , but it turns out , it 's kind of fun , " said @entity5 , laughing .			2

justice @entity5 talks about her life , her faith and her time on the @entity3
she spoke to a mostly @entity19 audience in @entity0 this week
" the role of the judge is to step back *...* and look just at interpreting the law , " she says
