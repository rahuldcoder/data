-- as @entity2 recalls millions of cars , the @entity1 reports that an average of 25 percent of @entity6 consumers who get recall notices do n't follow through and fix their vehicles			1
the @entity9 wondered : is there a way to ensure compliance with auto recalls ? most vehicle recalls involve free fixes for the consumer			1
@entity17 with the @entity18 , a consumer watchdog group , says there is not a process to ensure that auto owners comply with recalls			1
the center says vehicle insurers have an incentive and a method to reach car owners who have n't complied fully with recalls			2
" insurers have the @entity30 [ vehicle identification numbers ] , and they could contact the insured drivers who have failed to comply , " @entity17 says			2
because states are responsible for issuing a vehicle 's registration , @entity17 sees an opportunity for state governments to force compliance			1
he says that states could refuse to renew registration until the manufacturer 's fix has been made			2
however , he says , no states have taken this step so far			0
according to @entity45 , some states do require owners to make the requisite repairs before they attempt to sell the affected car			0
@entity49 , with the @entity50 , says that auto insurers will pay damage claims caused by the current @entity2 defects , then go after @entity2 for reimbursements			0
@entity0 personal finance editor @entity55 says that new car dealers are prevented from selling a defective car			0
if recall communications are deemed insufficient , the @entity1 can require further efforts from the manufacturer			0
but there is not a mechanism at the federal level to ensure that drivers comply			1
bottom line : if the @entity1 's 25 percent noncompliance figure is any indication , there could be many affected @entity2 models that do not get the requisite fix under the current recall			1
although there have been suggestions for how to better enforce recalls , there is no mechanism in place to force drivers to make the change			0
@entity0 's @entity80 and @entity82 's @entity81 contributed to this report .			0
