-- @entity1 makes himself at home when he travels for work			2
travel experts say you should negotiate a cheap room rate long before you get to your hotel			1
as he goes around the country selling his small company 's coffee - energy drink hybrid , @entity11 , he has found that staying in friends ' homes saves him a substantial amount of money he might otherwise spend on lodging			2
" for three nights , that 's almost a thousand bucks right there , " the @entity18 , @entity19 , businessman said			1
" a bottle of wine on the kitchen counter when you leave goes a long way -- or making sure the fridge is stocked			0
if we go out to dinner , we definitely cover the tab			0
" many businesses are cutting back on travel budgets , and many small companies have to be inventive to trim costs			0
staying with friends is an extreme exercise in frugality , but when it comes to lodging , several experts and frequent travelers stress the importance of considering every way to save money during these difficult financial times			1
" the first thing that someone looking to save money should do , they need to think about what they actually want from a hotel , " said business travel expert @entity47			1
" if you just need a bed and a shower , you do n't need to stay at the @entity58 , go to @entity59			2
" @entity47 , editor of joesentme.com , a web site for business travelers , also suggested visiting a hotel 's main company web site to find the cheapest rates for price comparisons			1
you could also use a blind bidding site , such as @entity67 , but it 's a gamble because you do n't know which hotel you 'll get			2
for @entity47 , it 's worth it to choose a hotel and pay a bit extra			2
other frequent travelers told @entity0 the ways they 're thinking outside the box to stay within their tight travel budgets			1
sharing a room or home @entity79 , owner of @entity80 , says home stays offer big savings and a better way to enjoy the city			1
home stays are rooms in residences that cost little , if anything at all			1
" they are amazing -- not only do they save you money , but they give you a much more interesting trip , " he said , pointing out that the owner of the home can steer you toward local attractions and eateries			2
@entity79 not only uses home stays when he is on the road , he also offers a room at his home for people visiting @entity105			1
he uses @entity106 , a nonprofit organization that promotes cross-cultural understanding by connecting travelers with hosts			2
@entity106 interviews and approves travelers and charges an annual fee for travelers			2
other web sites allow people to rent out their entire homes or rooms within their homes			2
@entity1 said he likes @entity119 , on which people post pictures of the rooms for let and prices			2
@entity79 also said that conference attendees can often split a room with someone from another company			0
the meeting planner of a conference he recently attended set up a @entity131 page for participants seeking roommates			0
in most cases , if you check with the conference planner , he or she can try to help you find a room to share			1
call the hotel if you decide it would be easiest to stay at a hotel , you need to pick up the phone , some of the frequent travelers said			1
@entity79 and @entity145 , ceo of @entity146 , urge business travelers to call their destination hotel and book through its reservation staff			1
make sure you ask for the best rate and negotiate			0
then go one step further and pit a few hotels against each other , @entity145 said			0
you can get rooms for half price that way , he said			0
" i think the phone is the killer app that everyone keeps forgetting about , " he said			0
" pick up the phone , call the hotel and tell them you can get a better deal and ask them what they can do for you			0
" if you do n't get the deal you want , consider another hotel that is substantially cheaper and close by			0
but do n't go for the lowest price			0
" i have found there is n't a whole lot of difference between the $ 60 - a - night and the $ 200 - a - night hotel , " @entity79 said			0
" but there is quite a bit of difference from the $ 29 - a - night hotel and the $ 60 - a - night hotel			0
" @entity47 said to consider your time as a valuable commodity , so weigh the cost of negotiating against the time it would take to get a much lower rate			1
rack up the points @entity1 does n't always stay with friends , so he tries to stay at a hotel chain where he can get points toward future stays or airline tickets			1
all major chains offer programs with free enrollment			1
@entity194 , a vice president with @entity195 , said members of a loyalty program also get extra perks , such as larger rooms or free @entity200			0
but the best advantage is earning points , something even a person who only travels occasionally can do , she said			1
" you can easily rack up enough points in just a few stays to earn enough points for a free night , " she said			1
about 90 percent of reward redemptions at @entity210 are for hotel stays			1
with the summer traveling season ahead , many chains are starting promotional periods this month to increase the number of loyalty points you can earn for each night 's stay or items you can win			1
@entity219 is offering loyalty club members the chance to earn a free set of high - end golf clubs , for instance			1
@entity210 is adding bonus points			0
points also can be earned across the brand			0
so if you choose an extended - stay hotel , you get rewards for giveaways , too			1
and increasingly , extended - stay hotels are becoming more attractive for business travelers , who can save money by using them as an apartment away from home			1
a growing number of travelers are buying groceries and cooking in their rooms , experts said			2
still , the most important factor in hotel choice is the price of the room , said @entity246 of @entity219 , and hotels are taking a serious look at how much they charge so they can stay competitive			1
all the experts said planning ahead is the key to saving money			0
figure out your lodging well in advance			0
research and weigh your options			0
save money where you can , but remember that comfort and convenience also have a value , especially when an important business meeting is involved			0
but watch the little costs , @entity47 cautioned			0
for one , do n't get room service ; take a trip to a local restaurant instead			0
" there 's no need to buy a $ 30 club sandwich , " he said .			0
