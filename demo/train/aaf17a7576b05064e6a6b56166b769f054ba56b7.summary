-- designer and tv host @entity1 is a member of the @entity5 celebrity @entity3 , which helps to highlight the organization 's initiatives and response efforts			1
founded in 1881 , the @entity5 is part of a worldwide movement that offers humanitarian care to victims of war and natural disasters			1
@entity1 recently spoke with @entity0 's @entity15 about his personal connection to the @entity5 and how he is giving back			1
below are excerpts from that interview			0
@entity15 : why are you involved with the @entity5 ? @entity1 : i have a very personal connection to the @entity5 because when i survived the tsunami -- the @entity24 tsunami , which was seven years ago now -- the @entity22 was the first sign of help that i saw with my own eyes			1
the sad part for me was that my partner , who i was traveling with to a tiny surfing village in @entity31 , did n't survive ... like many , many other people			2
and it was really an eye - opening experience for me ... and a soul - opening experience for me because i think we really do n't know who we are until we do n't have the resources that we need			2
@entity40 : how did that experience affect you ? @entity1 : for me , having survived a natural disaster of that magnitude , there are things that happen that you do n't even think about			1
sometimes you just need a pair of flip - flops so that your feet are n't cut as you 're walking around in the debris			1
sometimes you need the equivalent of $ 5 in foreign currency to make a phone call to tell the people that love you you 're ok or that somebody you love is not ok			2
and sometimes you need somebody just to give you a pencil and a piece of paper so that you can write down important details ... things that are flying through your mind like your passport number			0
i went through a very long period of grief and also sort of re-acclimating myself to what the reality of my life was			0
@entity40 : what is your role as a member of the celebrity @entity3 ? @entity1 : the main goal for me is to raise awareness of what the @entity5 does			1
i think especially at this time of the year , we all have so many holiday traditions			0
... and if one of those traditions as families could be to volunteer or donate blood to the @entity5 as part of everything that we take for granted in this season , it would be really amazing			1
that kind of thinking is what being on the celebrity @entity3 is all about			0
and obviously with the visibility that i 'm lucky enough to have -- having a daily talk show and being able to meet people all across the country -- it 's a way for me to give back to an organization that gave me something when i did n't have anything			0
@entity40 : why are you involved in the @entity101 campaign ? @entity1 : i think the @entity101 campaign is really great because it highlights everyday people that we relate to , and it brings them to a place where they 're getting recognition			2
but even as you 're watching , you know that the recognition is not what they are after			0
what they 're after was the deed that they chose to do			0
there 's so much on tv ... so much passive , yucky stuff that just fills our brain with things that do n't inspire us at all			2
and to watch somebody doing something for somebody else -- completely selflessly , having no idea that they would be chosen by @entity0 to be a hero -- is something that 's worthwhile for everyone to watch .			0

designer @entity1 survived the @entity24 tsunami of 2004 , but his partner did not
@entity1 credits the @entity5 for helping him get through the disaster
@entity1 : it 's the little things that matter in *emergencies* , such as flip - flops and money to call home
