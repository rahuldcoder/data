it 's all fun and games in the world of comic book movies -- until pro football gets involved			0
@entity6 and @entity7 -- two of the hottest actors in @entity10 because of their superhero roles in recent @entity13 movies -- are waging a friendly feud on @entity15 , resulting in an epic bet over the @entity17			1
in one corner , we have " @entity22 's " @entity7 , a dyed - in - the - wool fan of the @entity21			1
@entity7 landed the first blow monday with a tweet to @entity6 that said in part , " for the next 2 weeks , you are not my friend , you are my enemy			2
" in the other corner , we have @entity6 , the " @entity33 " star , who roots for the @entity31			2
@entity6 quickly fired back with a dig at @entity7 ' @entity13 character			1
then @entity7 upped the ante			0
@entity6 framed the first half of the bet : if the @entity21 lose , @entity7 must come to @entity39 and visit a children 's hospital in his superhero duds and waving a @entity31 fan - club flag			1
and @entity7 responded in turn , daring @entity6 to come to a @entity45 pediatric cancer center dressed as @entity46 from " guardians			2
" and so the bet is on			0
it 's always possible that this exchange is a joke or a promotional stunt -- @entity7 ' @entity22 co-stars in " @entity53 : age of @entity56 , " hitting theaters may 1 -- but the @entity17 just got a little more exciting			0
now @entity13 just hopes the two will mend fences after the game on february 1 .			0
