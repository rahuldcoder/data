-- this might sound like a legal conundrum : a @entity4 jury has pronounced @entity5 not guilty of murdering @entity6			1
but a court could still hold him accountable for the death			0
@entity6 's family so far has only commented that it wants the public to respect the @entity4 court 's verdict			1
two options , however , are available : a civil suit , or a civil rights suit			1
though they sound similar , they are very different			0
a civil suit allows one party to seek monetary damages against another for causing physical or emotional harm , regardless of the outcome of a criminal trial			2
a civil rights suit involves criminal charges for violating someone 's civil rights , which are protected under federal law			1
feds are asked to act civil suit take what happened to @entity35 17 years ago			2
after a criminal court acquitted him of charges in the 1994 killing of his ex-wife @entity40 , a civil court held him responsible in 1997 for her " wrongful death			1
" it ordered him to pay her family more than $ 33 million in damages			0
various courts then stripped @entity40 of every asset they could get their hands on			0
wrongful death is easier to prove than murder or manslaughter			2
a defendant can be held liable , even if he or she did n't intend to cause the victim 's death , according to @entity4 law			1
simple negligence is enough , if it results in death			0
did @entity5 act negligently , when he exited his vehicle to pursue @entity6 on foot while carrying a gun -- although a 911 operator told him not to ? would the 17 - year - old still be alive if @entity5 had not done so ? those are questions a lawyer for @entity6 's family would be sure to ask in a wrongful death suit			1
@entity6 's family has so given no indication so far of wanting to pursue an additional suit			1
@entity6 's dad : my heart is broken , my faith is not civil rights suit the @entity78 is pushing the @entity80 @entity79 to file a civil rights suit			1
they accuse @entity5 of racial profiling that led to @entity6 's death -- an allegation that @entity5 , his family and his supporters have denied			1
analysis : the role that race played " the most fundamental of civil rights -- the right to life -- was violated the night @entity5 stalked and then took the life of @entity6 , " the group said			1
@entity78 president @entity96 told @entity0 's " @entity103 " on sunday that remarks made by @entity5 and people who live in his @entity100 , @entity4 , neighborhood had sparked the group 's concern			1
" when you look at ( @entity5 's ) comments , and when you look at comments made by young black men who lived in that neighborhood about how they felt especially targeted by him , there is reason to be concerned that race was a factor in why he targeted young @entity6 , " @entity96 said			1
the @entity78 leader 's allegations drew sharp criticism sunday from @entity117 , who argued that @entity119 interviews have already shown that his brother is n't racist			2
" i do n't think ( @entity96 ) does anything for civil rights by perpetuating a narrative that has now been proven false			2
... they 've investigated i think about three dozen of his closest friends and acquaintances			0
and there is not any inkling of racism			0
in fact , there 's evidence to show the opposite , " he said			0
" i would encourage them to cool their jets , give everyone some time to kind of process what 's going on			0
agitation does n't help us			0
it does n't do anybody any good right now			0
" the rev. @entity147 told @entity0 's " @entity151 " on sunday that his @entity148 also wants the @entity79 to look into possible civil rights violations in the case			1
" there 's a @entity6 in every town , " he said			2
" that 's why the @entity79 has a role to play , to look at this pattern , because equal protection under the law remains elusive			2
" the @entity79 did not respond directly to the @entity78 demand			2
it has a separate federal investigation going on			0
" experienced federal prosecutors will determine whether the evidence reveals a prosecutable violation of any of the limited federal criminal civil rights statutes within our jurisdiction , and whether federal prosecution is appropriate in accordance with the department 's policy governing successive federal prosecution following a state trial , " it said in a sunday statement			1
it 's a legal path that worked in the case of @entity176 , whom @entity178 police officers clubbed down in 1991 after a car chase			0
the beating of the @entity182 - @entity80 man was caught on video and later aired on news broadcasts			0
when a criminal court failed to convict the white officers of police brutality , riots ensued in @entity178 over alleged racial discrimination			0
the @entity79 filed a civil rights suit against the officers , alleging racial profiling , and two were convicted in 1993 as a result			1
a court sentenced them to 30 months in federal prison			0
@entity0 's @entity198 and @entity199 contributed to this report .			0
