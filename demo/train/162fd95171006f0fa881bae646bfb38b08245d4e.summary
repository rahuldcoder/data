-- lost in the laughter over the past two weeks has been @entity3 presidential candidate and former house speaker @entity5 's core point about @entity7 's future in space			1
we should n't just explore space , we should develop and even settle it , using the same enterprise - friendly approaches that helped open the @entity11 and the skies			1
as a former @entity15 executive , it is clear to me that most commentators do n't understand this is now possible , let alone necessary			1
@entity20 's recent @entity0 viewpoint is eerily similar to what critics have said about other visionary ideas during @entity7 's history			1
in 1844 , @entity25 ( cousin of cotton gin inventor @entity27 ) proposed to the @entity29 that @entity7 build a transcontinental railroad			1
@entity7 sen. @entity31 of @entity32 responded that it was " an imposture , a humbug ; it could have emanated only from a madman ... science was unequal to overcome the @entity37 -- and now @entity27 proposed to scale the @entity38 , four or five times as high ! why sir , it 's madness ! " ... " you are one hundred years before your time			1
" the golden spike was pounded into the ground in @entity46 just 25 years later			2
in 1867 , secretary of state @entity47 proposed that @entity7 purchase @entity48 from @entity49 for $ 7.2 million			1
@entity50 of the @entity51 mocked @entity47 , calling it " a frozen wasteland			0
" @entity48 became known as " @entity54			0
" it was one of the best investments @entity7 ever made			1
@entity20 : a moon colony is a waste of money to be fair , @entity20 makes a point that must be addressed : " with the greatest respect , " @entity20 wrote , " ' the wonder and glory of it ' is not a very compelling answer to the question : ' what do i get for my hundred billion bucks ? ' " the answer is that we should n't spend that much , and certainly not for " wonder and glory			2
" @entity72 's core point is that we must change how and why we do space by leveraging the power of free enterprise			1
whatever misgivings you might have about @entity72 , in this case he is right			0
@entity7 history proves that smart , focused action by the @entity7 government can jump start entire new industries that open new frontiers -- from western railroads , to the air , to the @entity87 - and that is exactly where we are today in space			1
in 2011 , i led a @entity15 team that designed a strategy that could return @entity7 to the moon in 10 years for $ 40 billion			2
we can do so by using existing launch vehicles			0
more importantly , this strategy could also enable a new commercial space - plane industry and fundamentally enhance @entity7 national security			1
space launch today costs about $ 10,000 per pound			2
our national security space systems are dominated by small numbers of multibillion - dollar satellites			1
it takes over a decade to plan , develop and introduce new systems			0
a large army of people watches over each satellite			0
if this reminds you of mainframe computers in the mid- 1970s , then you know this sector of our economy is ripe for innovation			0
reusable space planes will forever change the space industry			1
the ability to launch frequently , reliably and at much lower cost will promote experimentation and enable new solutions			0
@entity15 's @entity122 concluded that @entity7 has the basic technology to build space planes now			1
the primary problem is the proven market is not large or certain enough to justify the investments required			0
a @entity128 investment advisory firm , @entity127 , independently validated our conclusion			0
we 've been here before			0
in the 1850s , it was not possible to close the business case for a transcontinental railroad			0
the size , cost and risk of the private investment was too large			0
then @entity29 passed the @entity139 of 1862			0
@entity7 entrepreneurs connected a continent and provided rapid , reliable , low - cost access across the country			2
they quickly accomplished what had been deemed impossible two decades earlier			0
@entity7 was never to be invaded again ; no one would dare			2
we were firmly on the path to become a world superpower			2
fast forward to the 1920s			0
airline entrepreneurs were unable to raise the capital to purchase new airplanes because the passenger travel market was considered speculative			0
then @entity29 passed the @entity154 of 1925			0
with airmail contracts in hand , private airlines sprouted up all over @entity7			2
less than two decades later , @entity7 airpower helps win @entity160 today , we are at a similar juncture			2
we have lost world leadership in commercial space transportation			1
but we can recapture it with totally reusable space planes			1
space planes are the transcontinental railroad of our generation			1
space planes will open the next frontier -- the greater @entity170 -- to economic activity and bind it together			1
space planes will radically lower launch costs leading to new applications , new industries and new jobs			1
the growth in demand will lead to even higher flight rates , lower costs and new opportunities			0
as this virtuous cycle takes hold , @entity7 's role as the preeminent world leader in space will be assured for the next 50 years			1
@entity7 national security will be permanently enhanced			1
and we will get a little wonder and glory , too			0
