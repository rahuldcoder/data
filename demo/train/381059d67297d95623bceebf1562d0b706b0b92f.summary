-- no one ever handed her anything			2
she never had it made			2
born in @entity4 in 1905 , an only child , she soon moved with her parents to @entity7			2
as she grew up , she developed a love of reading and an interest in writing , and submitted stories to her small - town newspaper			2
she studied @entity14 at college in @entity7 ; she briefly and unhappily married and then divorced			2
she worked whatever jobs she could find			2
her husband had built up numerous debts , including gambling losses ; she vowed that she would make good on all of them , and she did			2
she sold some stories to the @entity22 , using her full name as a byline : @entity25			1
she moved to @entity26 , found work at the @entity28 , and eventually became the editor of a women 's - interest magazine			1
but she was homesick -- and she yearned to write a different kind of story			1
in @entity26 , she would go to the public library to read up on the saga of the @entity35 and would go to the movies to watch thrilling films on that same theme			2
she missed @entity7 , and what she most wanted to do was write westerns			2
the authorship of @entity42 -- tales of cowboys and rustlers and settlers and the rough - hewn world around them -- had traditionally been a men 's club			1
@entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 -- right up to today , those are the kinds of names most frequently associated with famous @entity59 novels			1
there did n't seem to be much room for a @entity25			1
she knew she was good enough to succeed			1
here are six words for you : " @entity65			1
she changed her byline to @entity69 , feeling that @entity25 sounded too frilly ; she wrote the short story that was turned into one of the greatest @entity59 movies ever made			1
a men 's club ? @entity75 , the director of the 1962 film , and @entity78 , @entity79 and @entity80 , the stars , welcomed her into their own club			1
so did @entity83 , who starred in another movie based on one of her stories : 1959 's " @entity88			1
" and @entity90 , who starred in 1970 's " @entity89			1
" last sunday 's column , about the immortality that the highest level of artistry confers upon the artist , centered on the life of @entity97 , but it also mentioned some authors whose work will long endure			1
in between the names of @entity102 and @entity103 , i placed the name of @entity69			2
a number of you asked who she was			2
i 'm glad you did			0
i was kind of hoping you would			0
because , in addition to the wonderful talent she possessed , she is a prime example of how , if you set your heart to it , you have a chance to accomplish just about anything			0
she died in 1984 , at the age of 78			0
according to the obituary published in the @entity120 , she wrote 17 books , more than 50 short stories and many poems and magazine articles			0
after she moved back @entity35 , she taught college writing courses			0
the @entity127 bestowed upon her their highest honors			0
her writing was so clean , so spare -- she knew just how to draw her readers into a tale and keep them hanging on right up to the last word in the last sentence of the last paragraph			1
westerns may not be as popular as they once were , but beautiful writing is eternal			0
your public library , if you 're lucky , has some @entity69 books ; i think you 'll find them a treat			0
@entity143 , the public - broadcasting station in @entity144 , @entity7 , put together an affectionate 27 - minute documentary on her life called " @entity148 in her gut and @entity151 in her eye			0
" if you 'd like to see it , here it is			0
because she seemed to enjoy putting unexpected twists into her plots , and because we 're talking about " @entity65 , " i 'll end this with a story about the movie i think she might have liked			1
during my years of musical travels , i became friends with @entity165 , the singer whose hits included " @entity167 , " " twenty - four hours from @entity169 , " " @entity170 " and , of course , " @entity65			1
" once you hear that song , you never forget it			0
@entity165 told me that he constantly heard two things from fans			0
either they would say : " i thought your song was one of the best parts of the movie			0
" or : " i was watching ' @entity65 ' on tv last night , and they cut your song out of it			1
they must have had to edit it for time			0
" both sets of fans , @entity165 said , were wrong			0
" i thought i was recording it for the movie , " @entity165 said			0
he was justifiably excited about the prospects			0
with that cast and that director , the film was destined to be a big hit			1
during the recording session , a friend of @entity165 's left the studio , went outside for a few minutes and saw a marquee on a movie theater			1
the person came back , @entity165 said , and broke the news to him : " in the middle of the recording session , i found out that the movie had already come out			0
" to say that made him a little depressed is an understatement			0
" here 's a movie with @entity79 , @entity80 and @entity78 -- and the song does n't get into the movie , " he said			1
but people continue to think they heard it there			0
for a long time , @entity165 would gently set the questioners straight			0
by the time he died in 2006 , though , he often just smiled and let them believe what they wanted to believe			0
he was living up to a line with which every @entity69 fan -- and every fan of " @entity65 " -- is quite familiar : when the legend becomes fact , print the legend			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity224 .			1

@entity25 yearned to break into the boy 's club of @entity59 story writers
her story " @entity65 " was turned into a film with *top* @entity233 stars
@entity224 : she knew how to draw readers into a tale and keep them hanging until the end
