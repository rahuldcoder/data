@entity0 -- the agency that owns the space where the @entity5 towers stood is freeing itself of the term " freedom " to describe the signature skyscraper replacing the buildings destroyed on september 11 , 2001			0

" many will always refer to it as the @entity11 , but as the building moves out of the planning stage and into full construction and leasing , we believe that going forward it is most practical to market the building as @entity11			1
" ten of the building 's planned 108 above - ground floors have been built			1
" the fact is , more than $ 3 billion of public money is invested in that building , and , as a public agency , we have the responsibility to make sure it is completed and that we utilize the best strategy to make certain it is fully occupied , " @entity22 added			0

" i have no idea what the commercial aspects are , and we can say , ' oh , we should n't worry about that , ' but of course you have to , particularly now			0
" i would like to see it stay the @entity11 , but it 's their building , and they do n't need me dumping on it			1
if they could rent the whole thing by changing the name , i guess they 're going to do that , and they probably , from a responsible point of view , should			0
from a patriotic point of view , is it going to make any difference ? " he added , " one of the things is , we call things what we want to call them			0
so , @entity89 is a good example , for it 's @entity89 to most people			0
very few people use @entity89			0
if they name this @entity11 , people will still call it the @entity11			2
