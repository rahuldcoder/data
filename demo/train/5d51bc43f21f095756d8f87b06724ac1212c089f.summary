-- much is being made of @entity2 's recent remarks about leaving the @entity3 " dead broke " and how she and @entity4 are n't like those who are " truly well off " despite earning more than $ 100 million together since 2001			1
and now she 's getting heat for the $ 225,000 in speaking fees she 's getting for a @entity9 speech			1
apparently when prescribing a vision for @entity12 that divides us along the lines of class and income , the medicine always tastes better when taken by someone else			2
but setting politics aside , much should be made of these comments simply because they demonstrate that many of those who rail against economic freedom are out of touch and have a fundamental misunderstanding of how jobs and wealth are created in this country			1
opinion : petty attacks on @entity2 just wo n't matter let 's start with the basics			1
all @entity12 , regardless of who they are or where they come from , want a good - paying job with more opportunity , choice and control over their economic and personal futures			1
but this is more than a common desire shared by all @entity12			2
history shows that this time - tested formula is the key to upward mobility and a healthy economy -- in other words , wealth creation			2
it must be nice to get paid millions of dollars to write a book about yourself , just as it must be nice to get paid millions of dollars to sink three - pointers in the @entity58 or to star in a @entity60 summer blockbuster			0
but athletes and entertainers , like the @entity63 , are notable exceptions			0
let me be clear -- i 'm not criticizing them for their financial success			0
after all , they all have unique skill sets that few others possess , so the laws of supply and demand apply			0
most @entity12 success stories , and the jobs that result , involve hardworking individuals and families who take significant personal and financial risk , work from sunrise to sunset and persevere through good times and bad			1
this is @entity85 success -- the bedrock our country was built on			0
we all can name countless shining examples of entrepreneurs , inventors and innovators who took those risks , invested in their local companies and created jobs			0
these @entity12 -- these job creators -- are the same people @entity2 calls " truly wealthy			1
" others , like president @entity99 , continually attack , criticize and stigmatize the success these individuals achieved through hard work			0
this might make for good politics and help distract from the numerous scandals and poor economic outlook reported on the nightly news , but it is a terrible way to treat fellow @entity12 , especially when the economy continues to struggle and job creation remains weak			1
now @entity2 is no novice , so i suspect her pollsters will inform her that she fumbled the ball on this one , and her advisers will counsel her to shift the discussion back to something like income inequality			0
it will be good for this country to have an honest discussion about income inequality , but let 's address it in a way without demonizing the success and entrepreneurial spirit that helps solidify the backbone of this country			1
too many @entity12 are suffering and living paycheck - to - paycheck while trying to make ends meet			1
family budgets are getting tighter as prices for gas and groceries keep rising			0
rather than responding to these harsh realities with the politics of division and distraction and pitting @entity12 against each other for political gain , @entity136 should work toward real , commonsense solutions that help create jobs for hardworking families			1
we need efficient and more effective programs that wo n't bankrupt our government and drag down our economy			0
we need a shift in focus from empty promises , handouts and shallow accusations to education , job training and encouragement toward hard work and entrepreneurship			0
in other words , to paraphrase a @entity162 operative , " it 's about opportunity , stupid			0
" as @entity12 's economy continues to struggle , @entity85 success in @entity12 , now more than ever , should be encouraged , not attacked			2
@entity167 : petty attacks on @entity2 just wo n't matter how @entity2 flubbed the wealth question join us on @entity172 / @entity171 .			2

@entity175 - @entity174 says that @entity2 's comments about wealth have a *deeper* impact on @entity12
this , he says , might make for good politics , but is *ultimately* bad for the country
@entity185 also has come under fire for $ 225,000 in speaking fees for a @entity9 speech
