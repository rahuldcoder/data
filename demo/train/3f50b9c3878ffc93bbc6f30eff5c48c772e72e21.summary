one of the nation 's most prestigious teams of flying aerobats dive - bombed into the depths of sexual harassment and stayed there for at least a year , a new @entity1 study says			1
under the command of capt. @entity11 , members of the @entity9 openly passed around pornography and flew with it in their cockpits during airshows			1
they cursed gays and spread dirty talk about women			1
their chauvinistic behavior turned the squadron into a hostile workplace , a @entity1 investigation into the shenanigans said			1
and @entity11 not only tolerated them ; he set examples of bad behavior and animated those under his command			0
@entity11 was reprimanded after a disciplinary proceeding this week and was previously relieved of his duties as an executive officer			2
the 63 - page document reads like a cross between the burlesque b movies " @entity35 " and " @entity36 , " as it describes how the squad 's @entity37 took on the atmosphere of a college fraternity			2
the @entity9 are the friendly face of the @entity1 and @entity42 and put on aerial stunt shows before live audiences across the country most every week			1
the scandal has sullied their reputation and that of the military branches they represent , @entity1 investigators said			1
giant genital graffiti at one point during @entity11 's stint , an oversized penis painted in the blue and gold colors of the @entity9 adorned the roof of an airplane hangar			1
the image was so large that it could be seen by satellites and appeared on @entity62 images			0
a member of the squadron painted over the graffiti , and the satellite map image has since disappeared			2
@entity11 has not always had a reputation for raunch			0
he led the @entity9 twice , and the first time around , he snuffed out such risque stunts as a matter of maintaining professional order , the investigation said			1
he completed a " successful and unmarred tour as the commanding officer of the @entity9 from 2008 to 2010 , " the @entity1 said			1
once that tour was over , he handed over the reins , but his successor committed a safety violation in may 2011			0
the @entity9 had to cancel a show and go through a safety stand - down			1
the commander stepped down , and @entity11 returned			2
he received a " hero 's welcome " and decided he 'd do something to cheer the @entity9 up : throw out some protocol and crank up camaraderie			1
tolerating chauvinism @entity11 was not the first to introduce lewd practices to the squadron , but he no longer clamped down as much and sometimes participated			2
@entity89 had made its way into the squadron around the time the captain 's first command ended , the investigation said			2
" both male and female crew chiefs cut out and placed the pornography in the cockpits , " it said			0
during the investigation , the practice was cited by some witnesses as " motivational			0
" it was seen as a way of building trust among team members			1
most of the pictures were depictions of naked women			2
crew members who objected could complain and opt out , but some felt under pressure not to do so , the review said			0
eventually , tensions over the pictures rose , and @entity11 asked two female team members for their opinion , the investigation said			0
they told him they would feel more comfortable if the photos used were of women in bikinis and not nudes			0
but eventually , he received an anonymous letter complaining about that practice , too , and he canned it -- but reportedly not without complaining to team members about someone having sent the letter			0
online porn and scorn but porn crept into more than just the cockpits and the @entity37			0
the group set up a site on the online service @entity137 for scheduling purposes , and profanity and porn dotted the posts			1
@entity11 saw them and joined in			0
" his initial post after joining the forum was " f * * * you , " the investigation said			0
when pornographic images did n't show up in the feed for a while , the captain called for members to post more of them			0
and he joined in raucous commenting on the lewd images			0
a @entity153 photo of a female enlisted member of the squadron in a bikini turned up in the @entity37 , and @entity11 did not object to it			0
juvenile to hostile when investigators showed officers who had served during the captain 's first stint as commanding officer examples of the homophobic humor on maps , raunchy jokes and pornography that became common during his second stint , they were shocked			1
" these officers unanimously indicated that such material would not have been tolerated during their time under @entity176 at the @entity9 , " the investigation said			2
in november 2012 , the captain 's command ended ; he moved on , and his successor inherited a cleanup job			0
the @entity1 set up awareness training from various equal opportunity programs to rid the @entity9 of the smut			1
in 2014 , a service member filed a complaint against @entity11 for his lax handling of the harassing atmosphere during his command			0
@entity1 investigators concluded that the former commander had allowed what may have seemed like juvenile behavior descend into a " toxic " atmosphere			1
ex-blue @entity9 commander reassigned during sexual harassment inquiry			1

porn , homophobic jokes and dirty talk about women became common , @entity1 review finds
it says the team 's commander called for more porn postings in squadron scheduling service
raunchy practices were viewed as a way of building trust among @entity9 , the study says
the @entity1 reprimanded the commander and gave *anti-harassment* training to team
