-- there are stories you just wish were n't true , and for me , a mom of two young girls , this is one of them : media outlets counting the days until @entity9 , one of the youngest members of the @entity12 clan , turns 18			1
the celebrity site @entity14 posted a photo last week -- a very revealing one , at that -- of @entity17 in short shorts and a bikini , with this headline : " @entity9 53 days			1
" hmmm -- 53 days until what ? a new tv gig ? a new modeling contract ? until she announces college plans ? oh no , my friends			0
below the headline and the supremely sexy photo was this : " until she turns 18			1
not that we 're counting			2
" it was n't just @entity14			0
another celeb site , @entity35 , tweeted the same photo and added this : " to all those wondering , @entity9 turns 18 in 52 days			1
" i was n't wondering -- were you ? and here 's the thing : something just does n't feel quite right about the whole concept of a countdown for a young woman about to turn the age when she 's legally viewed as an adult -- even a young woman like @entity17 , who has spent much of her life on reality tv			1
no matter how much @entity17 and her attention - seeking family pursue the national spotlight , and no matter how much @entity12 critics might question my spending time on this at all -- this story , let me be clear , is not about @entity9			1
it is about a child			0
@entity59 and @entity9 : growing up @entity12 after all , while no one is specifically indicating to what everyone is counting down , one can assume it 's not that @entity17 will soon be able to vote for the first time			1
" maybe they are counting down the days until she is legally responsible for her decisions , " said @entity65 , a mom of a 10 - year - old girl , on my personal @entity68 page			2
if only that were the case ! too hot for tweens : why some parents dread back - to - school shopping " there is a countdown clock waiting for a girl to turn 18 so they can ( ogle ) her more inappropriately then they already do , " @entity77 said on @entity0 's @entity68 page			1
" i think its a valid question about the appropriateness of waiting for a young lady to age so you can objectify her as a sex object			0
" " i believe it 's not fair game to count down to her being 18 , " said a reader via e-mail in response to a request for comments on @entity0 's @entity68 page , adding that it can be looked at as " perverted , disgusting and just plain wrong			1
" " anyone who is watching this countdown waiting for this child to turn 18 needs a mental evaluation			2
18 is still a child in every way , " said @entity104 , also on @entity0 's facebook page			2
" is nothing off limits ? " said @entity108 , a blogger and mom of six			0
" yes , i know her family has ' sold out			2
' " opinion : for strong daughters , stop with the sex stereotypes it is that last point -- how her family has embraced the media in every way possible -- that led many others to believe counting down until @entity17 turns 18 seems entirely appropriate			1
" @entity17 is part of the @entity12 clan and they live for the camera , " said @entity122 , a blogger , via e-mail			2
" they court the spotlight and when you make the choice to live this way , you live with the consequences , and know the consequences will be taped			0
" @entity134 , a celebrity columnist in @entity135 , questions " why all the eyebrow raising			0
" " this would be different if the ladies did n't want this kind of attention , but they do , " @entity137 said			0
" that 's not to say this does n't go too far , but if it was inappropriate like everyone is screaming about , the @entity17 clan would have already stopped it			1
one call from a concerned mom ( better known as @entity150 ) would have pulled it down			0
" sadly , this is not the first time there 's been a public countdown until a celeb turns the legal age			1
years before @entity158 and @entity159 turned 18 , a number of internet sites popped up , counting down the years , months and days until the big day			2
and it 's not just a sexualization - of - girls thing			0
there was also a countdown until @entity166 reached the big one - eight , although one might argue this ogling until teens are " jailbait no more " seems to happen more for young women than young men			1
we know our kids grown up faster than ever , and we see that evidence just about everywhere we look , from the clothing options for our tweens and teens to the way their role models ( or former role models ) present themselves ( think @entity181 ! ) to the concerns about the photos they 're sending each other online			0
adult - inspired lingerie marketed for young girls that said , ca n't we expect or demand that , as @entity108 said , certain things should be completely off limits ? @entity192 , a mom of one and co-host of the blog @entity195 on a @entity197 , said , " i do n't care for that family but ... still shame on @entity14 for perpetuating the sexualization of this child			0
" like @entity192 , i do n't quite get why there is such a fascination with this family			0
so why is this story news ? because it seems , at least to me , completely outrageous to count down until a young woman turns 18 , almost implying that once her 18th birthday approaches , she is fair game for sexual exploitation and objectification			1
as one reader said , " to be glorifying it is just wrong and teaches the wrong idea to people who do n't have common sense			0
follow @entity219 on @entity220 and like @entity221 on @entity68 .			0

some media sites are counting down until reality star @entity9 turns 18
women across country say the @entity17 countdown is inappropriate and gross
some say it 's fair game for a family always seeking the national spotlight
there were similar countdowns for the @entity238 and @entity166
