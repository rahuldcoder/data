both are cornerstones of our treasured @entity5 heritage as well as primary foundations of @entity8			1
the @entity10 faith preaches equality among races , genders , and classes and incorporates this teaching in all aspects of its practice			2
the @entity20 temple , or gurdwara , which means " @entity22 , " is open 24 hours a day , seven days a week , and has four doors pointing toward the four cardinal directions to welcome people from all faiths , creeds and backgrounds , demonstrating @entity20 ideals in its very architecture			1
you find this not only in @entity34 -- where the most notable of gurdwaras is the @entity36 -- but also right here in the @entity5			1
in fact , you 'll find it at the gurdwara in @entity41 , @entity42 , where one of those doors that welcomes all comers was used by someone who did not have equality in his heart			1
those four doors were kept open in no small part because of the tireless dedication and efforts of the president of the temple , @entity52 , a personal , family friend i had the pleasure of knowing since we first welcomed members of his family to southeastern @entity42 over 30 years ago -- a place that i still proudly call home			1
although we now know him as a victim of this horrendous act and as the hero who died trying to stop the gunman , i remember him as someone who never missed an opportunity to open his heart to you and greet you with a smile			1
and what a characteristic and beautiful smile it was			0
his whole family is a fixture in the @entity77 area and members carry with them that same spirit of love and caring			0
indeed , one of my fondest memories is of mr. @entity52 's family joyfully leading a group of guests in song at our home in @entity42 the day after our wedding			1
@entity91 intervened and my family and i did not attend services that sunday			0
the loss of our friends is deep and saddening and it hurts			2
but the effect it 's had on not just the @entity20 but the broader community has been nothing less than profound			0
and for that , in the midst of this grief , i am sincerely grateful			0
in @entity8 , all are welcome and are one , without condition or limitation			1
all @entity20 houses of worship have a community kitchen , called a langar , so that anyone in need of food can come and eat free of charge at any time			0
indeed , tradition dictates that everyone who participates in langar sit at an equal level with all other diners to remind congregants to practice what is preached -- that we are all one			0
both at langar and elsewhere , congregants strive to serve others , especially those less fortunate			0
it 's a practice known as seva , selfless service , and it represents the highest ideal and function of @entity20			0
at their core , the teachings and traditions of @entity8 represent the very best of what our beloved country stands for : a place of equality and opportunity open to and in service of all			1
and , as they 've done in both in their home country and here in the @entity5 , @entity20 have sacrificed greatly to ensure that this freedom is guaranteed to all			1
but , unfortunately , we also have to recognize that respecting and protecting the liberty and equality of all sometimes means making an uncomfortable peace with those who seek to undermine those very same principles			2
it means making a place for those who might not reflect our lofty ideals and who express hate instead of inclusion			1
it means making a place for , and respecting the existence of , people like @entity165 , who committed the massacre in @entity41 on sunday			1
a messy thing , freedom			2
that said , as @entity5 and as @entity20 , we are committed to respecting the essential rights of every human			1
we know the sacrifices of heroes like lt. @entity174 -- in critical condition after he was shot nine times helping victims -- @entity52 and myriad others , are worth it in the end			2
it 's the price of the society envisioned by the @entity183 and those sages who founded @entity8			2
indeed , it 's the price we pay for the very foundation of this country that we call home			0
after all , as it is written in the very first stanza of the @entity20 holy book , we are all one under one guiding spirit			0
not just those with whom we agree , but all of us			0
now , if only we could all remember that			0
join us on @entity200 / @entity199			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity203 .			2

@entity205 : freedom and equality are cornerstones of @entity5 and of @entity8
@entity203 was friends with temple head @entity52 , who died trying to stop gunman
respecting all includes finding a place in the heart for people who express hate , he writes
