@entity0 has taken the center stage as @entity3 's undisputed paramount leader			1
the @entity4 this week confirmed @entity0 as the new state president and chairman of the @entity7 , making him the @entity9 chief , head of state and commander - in - chief			1
this completes the handover of power from @entity15 , 70 , who ruled @entity3 for 10 years , to the 59 - year - old @entity0 , who was announced as the country 's presumptive leader last november			1
conventional wisdom had it that @entity0 would be a weak leader because he had not been hand - picked by late paramount leader @entity20 , as had @entity21 and @entity15			1
pundits also predicted that @entity0 would need two or three years to consolidate power because @entity21 and @entity15 , his predecessors , were " looking over his shoulder			1
" @entity0 is proving conventional wisdom wrong			1
in the past four months , @entity0 has taken steps to set him apart from his predecessor , signaling that change may be afoot			1
he has , for example , directed officials to minimize pomp and privilege , eschew ostentatious banquets and refrain from " empty talk			0
" in his speech to close the @entity4 at the weekend , @entity0 vowed to " always listen to the voice of the people and respond to the expectations of the people			1
" he pledged that his government would " strive to achieve the @entity3 dream of great rejuvenation of the @entity3 nation			1
" on assuming the @entity47 leadership last year , @entity0 symbolically made his first out - of - town trip not to a @entity50 or revolutionary shrine , but to @entity51 , the first laboratory of market reform which in a mere 30 years has evolved from a sleepy backwater village into a vibrant urban center			1
@entity51 is the product of @entity0 's late father @entity57 , a revolutionary leader who served as vice premier and governor of @entity61 province			1
while in @entity61 the elder @entity0 pioneered market reforms , including the creation of @entity64 , of which @entity51 was one			2
it 's not clear what legacy the younger @entity0 will leave so early into his reign , but analysts say events in the early days of his premiership have already put him to the test			2
one of @entity0 's first challenges came just a month after he took over as party chief			2
a few days after @entity79 , staffers of @entity76 , a liberal - leaning newspaper in the southern city of @entity78 staged a protest after a local propaganda official rewrote an editorial calling for stronger rule of law			0
the dispute escalated with other journalists and @entity3 celebrities giving protesters public support and putting pressure on @entity0 's new team to respect press freedom and free speech			1
days later a tentative compromise was reached , diffusing the crisis , but not all are impressed			0
" the crisis ended in a kind of a draw -- no side really won , " said @entity96 , professor at the @entity97			0
" the only reform in the pipeline is administrative -- the streamlining of the @entity3 cabinet , positive results likely but inconclusive			2
" @entity96 acknowledges @entity0 's new style but wonders if he brings new substance			2
" beyond a new way of speaking and a better ability to communicate and create empathy , @entity0 has not yet spelled out new policies or reforms , " @entity96 said			2
" he has indicated a willingness to deepen the fight against corruption and waste but by relying on the same institutions and methods			0
he has deepened @entity3 's foreign policy assertiveness but not really modified its modus operandi -- so it 's old wine in a new bottle ! " some @entity4 delegates i interviewed inside the @entity127 are more sanguine			2
" he rose up from county chief to the top , step by step , " delegate @entity128 told me			0
" even before he became number one , he knew what 's going on in our society , the ordinary people 's disappointments and aspirations			0
he knows what needs to be done to meet people 's expectations			0
" @entity128 is the ceo of @entity142 , a private pharmaceutical company based in @entity143			0
he hopes @entity0 's team can boost the private sector			2
" private enterprises generate jobs but we find it difficult to get loans , " he explained			0
" state - owned enterprises enjoy monopoly and have easier access to capital and resources so they make easy profits			0
" @entity158 , a senior editor in a state - run publishing house , likes @entity0 's background			2
" @entity0 is of my age , he also spent years in the countryside as an educated youth , just like me , " he said			0
" at least he knows the real situation then and now			0
" and @entity0 's new team ? " it 's a team of doers , " @entity158 added			0
" they are quite confident but they also face huge challenges			0
" many challenges demand urgent solutions : a slowdown in economic growth , rising joblessness , growing rich - poor divide , rampant corruption , environmental and pollution problems , public discontent and sharp social tension			0
on top of these , @entity0 has to manage a rising @entity3 and a surge in nationalism that is pushing @entity3 in confrontation with @entity186 and other neighbors			1
all these are causing political , social and economic tensions			0
@entity0 can not afford put big decisions on hold , analysts said			0
" the rising tide of mass resentment , emboldened by social media and ubiquitous communications , and the political scandals of 2012 , all combined with @entity0 's sense and vision to give him a power surge , " said @entity3 - watcher @entity193			1
" he has surprising credibility and abundant political capital			1
if he is serious about tackling @entity3 's entrenched problems , he will need to spend that political capital			1
" how @entity0 handle these issues will set the tone for @entity3 's 1.3 billion people -- and for the entire world .			1

@entity0 endorsed as @entity3 president in leadership handover
so far @entity0 has taken steps to set him apart from predecessor @entity15
pledged that his government would " strive to achieve the @entity3 dream "
