@entity0 used an appearance in @entity2 , @entity3 , on monday to talk up the work she did to combat " violent extremism " during her time as secretary of state			1
" we took decisive action against the threat of violent extremism , " @entity7 said of her four years as @entity9 's top diplomat , " certainly most practically from @entity13 and @entity15 's syndicate of terror			1
" the line is new for @entity7 and comes at a time that some have raised questions whether the @entity22 administration underestimated @entity23 , a terrorist group that has swept into power in areas of @entity26 and @entity27			1
president @entity22 decided during his first term not to help train and arm rebels in @entity26 , despite urging from @entity7 and other top advisers			1
in hindsight , some of those advisers say not arming @entity26 rebels helped lead to the rise of @entity23			2
last month , @entity22 authorized airstrikes against the terrorist group and training for @entity26 rebels			0
the @entity9 was joined by a coalition of countries , including @entity42 states , and @entity7 backed the action			2
on monday , the former secretary of state called dealing with @entity23 a " long - term struggle " in which military action is essential			1
the former first lady also refused to call the group by the name it calls itself : the @entity49			0
" whether you call them @entity23 or @entity23 , i refuse to call them the @entity49 , because they are neither @entity55 or a state , " @entity7 said			1
" whatever you call them , i think we can agree that the threat is real			0
" @entity7 justified military action against @entity23 , but not against other terrorist groups , because @entity23 ' " kind of jihadist extremism is expansionary			1
" " they believe that it is part of their mission to launch attacks , to infiltrate through foreign fighters into @entity72 societies , " @entity7 said			0
" if that were not the case , then we could have a different debate			0
i think the evidence is convincing , at least to me , that this is a group that will try to pick up where @entity15 in @entity78 left off			0
" @entity7 later argued that groups like @entity85 or @entity86 " have not yet evidenced a commitment to expanding their reach the way that this @entity23 group has			2
so , therefore , i think military action is critical			2
" but military action is " not sufficient alone			1
" " there has to be more , " @entity7 said			0
" you have to combat them on social media , you have to do more to enlist @entity42 support ... to demonstrate this is not some sort of an @entity9 / @entity72 effort and it involves significant @entity42 participation			0
" @entity23 has quickly gained sizable attention outside the @entity99 because it has beheaded a number of @entity72 aid workers and journalists			0
@entity7 touted what the @entity22 administration did to stop @entity15 in @entity78			1
" what we were able to do at great cost , " @entity7 said , " was to ferret out and decapitate the leadership of @entity15 , ( which ) severely undermined their capacity , as an organization , continues to threaten the @entity111			0

in @entity114 appearance , @entity0 touts her work to fight " violent extremism "
the new line comes as some question the @entity22 administration 's @entity23 *response*
@entity7 calls military action against @entity23 " essential " but " not sufficient alone "
