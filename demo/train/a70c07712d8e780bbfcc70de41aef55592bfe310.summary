a leading drug candidate for low sexual desire in women has n't gotten approved for use in the @entity4 , but the company backing it is n't giving up			2
@entity6 announced tuesday that the @entity7 gave the company " clear guidance " on " the path forward " for its drug to treat low libido in women , called flibanserin			1
the @entity7 had rejected an application to approve the drug last year , which @entity17 appealed			1
" the @entity7 has requested that @entity17 complete two additional @entity20 drug interaction studies and a phase i driving simulator study , " @entity17 said in a statement			1
such studies will look at different enzyme pathways and investigate whether the drug 's side effects would impair driving			1
sprout will resubmit the new drug application for flibanserin by the third quarter of this year , the company said			1
" we are encouraged by the @entity7 's response and view it as a significant step toward the approval of flibanserin , " said @entity33 , president and chief operating officer of @entity6 , in a statement			1
the @entity7 declined to answer specific questions regarding the matter when contacted by @entity44 in january			1
@entity7 spokeswoman @entity45 said in a statement : " the @entity7 is only able to provide information on approved drug product applications			1
any information on an application that has yet to receive an approval or was denied approval belongs to the manufacturer / sponsor developing the drug			2
" where 's the sex drive drug for women ? sprouting a drug @entity59 was initially developed by pharmaceutical giant @entity60 , but the company ditched it in 2010 after the @entity7 declined to approve their new drug application , asking for more research , said dr. @entity65 , director of sexual medicine at @entity67 in @entity68 , @entity69 , who collaborated on clinical trials for flibanserin			1
a smaller operation , @entity6 , took over work on the drug in 2011 , and resubmitted an application with 14 new clinical studies , encompassing data on more than 3,000 new patients , according to the company			1
the drug is designed for the treatment of @entity83 in women			2
that 's the technical term for when women have a distressing lack or absence of sexual desire or fantasy			2
up to one - third of adult women may experience it , according to a 2002 study			2
in total , more than 11,000 people have participated in clinical trials for flibanserin , @entity33 said			1
still , the most recent attempt to get flibanserin off the ground failed ; the @entity7 did not approve the company 's revised drug application in october			1
the @entity7 characterized the drug as having a " modest " effect in its response letter , @entity33 said			1
but clinical trial results show statistically significant improvement in the women who took the drug , compared to those who took a placebo , she said			1
" in terms of what we see , i would say ' modest ' is meaningful , " @entity33 said			0
sex is doctor 's life 's work a 2013 study in the @entity119 showed that women taking the drug reported an average increase of 2.5 satisfying sexual events in four weeks , compared to an increase of 1.5 among women using a placebo			1
flibanserin is not a hormonal treatment and does not appear to affect fertility or interact with birth control medications , @entity33 said			2
given that the drug has been through numerous , rigorous clinical trials , and so much has been invested in it , the @entity7 's refusal to approve it is a turning point in the field of sexual medicine , @entity65 said			1
the drug works by increasing brain blood flow in particular ways , @entity65 said			2
it increases levels of the neurotransmitters dopamine and noradrenaline , and lowers levels of serotonin			0
side effects of flibanserin include dizziness , nausea , fatigue and sleepiness			2
unlike some treatments for men , flibanserin needs to be taken once a day , every day			2
if there is no positive action on the drug , it could spell doom for pharmacological efforts to manage female sexual desire , he said			1
" it will go back to dark ages of saying , ' this is all a relationship problem , ' even though we know it 's not , " he said			2
other options there are other experimental treatments for low female sex drive in the works			0
drugs called @entity175 and @entity176 , developed by a company called @entity178 , have undergone several randomized studies with results that are " very promising and will be published soon , " according to the company 's website			1
a drug called @entity184 is being investigated by @entity185 for both men and women			2
none of these drugs has completed phase 3 trials , which are necessary before approval			0
@entity33 counts 24 @entity7 - approved treatments available in the @entity4 for male sexual dysfunction , including popular drugs such as @entity195 ( sildenafil citrate )			1
for women , it 's zero			0
" a lot of times , the medical community has really put men 's needs first and has n't really addressed women 's sexual needs , " said @entity198 , a sex therapist in @entity199 , @entity200 , who is not affiliated with flibanserin			1
because doctors have no solutions , women have tried less - proven treatments for their low sexual desire , such as diets and herbs			0
none of @entity198 's clients has had success with them			0
she said some women who are n't functioning well sexually would be " open to anything			0
" " i 've had women complain , ' why is n't there a female viagra ? ' " @entity198 said			0
sex drive : it 's complicated sex drive is more complicated for women than for men , @entity198 said			0
there are a lot of factors that could explain a woman 's low desire -- and not all of them are medical , she said			0
lifestyle and relationship issues may come into play			0
having a first child can be a problematic factor for some women ; the adjustment and figuring out how to restructure their sex life can throw off desire			0
@entity198 has spoken to some new mothers who feel they are constantly being asked for something from their body , as if they are " touched out , " but find their lack of desire troubling			0
some couples maintain satisfying sex lives over many years -- but some , over time , go on autopilot and have less and less sex			0
" you have to continue to feed your sexual relationship , and feed your relationship in general , " @entity198 said			0
" a lot of it depends on how much importance and energy you put toward your sex life			0
" sometimes stress is the issue , too , she said			0
@entity198 offers cognitive - behavioral , focused exercises to help women who are distressed about their low sexual desire			0
low sexual desire in women is n't necessarily a problem in menopause or later			0
@entity198 works with many women complaining of low sex drive who are in their 30s and 40s			0
the average age of participants in the flibanserin trials was 36 , @entity33 said			1
the new drug application the company will submit will be specifically for premenopausal women .			0
