-- in june 2004 , at the age of 85 , and five years after stepping down as @entity3 's president , @entity1 announced he was " retiring from retirement " to spend more time with family and friends , telling journalists , " do n't call me , i 'll call you			1
" as a globally recognized ambassador for a multiracial @entity3 , the conscience of his continent and an inspiration for strugglers against oppression everywhere , @entity1 was never going to be allowed to fade quietly into the history books			2
after leaving office , @entity1 continued to lend his tireless support to the fight against social injustice and poverty in @entity3 and beyond through fundraising organizations such as the @entity24 and the @entity25			2
persevering with diplomatic efforts he had initiated in government , @entity1 worked patiently to mediate in conflict - stricken @entity28 and the @entity29			1
@entity1 , who died thursday , also brought charisma , charm and enthusiasm to @entity3 's successful bid for the @entity34 , lobbying hard for the tournament to be awarded to an @entity37 nation for the first time			1
comfortable retirement may have mellowed @entity1 , but the instincts of the freedom fighter and anti-establishment activist still burned strongly			0
in early 2003 , he spoke out harshly against the imminent @entity44 invasion of @entity45 , accusing @entity44 president @entity46 of " wanting to plunge the world into a holocaust , " adding " if there is a country that has committed unspeakable atrocities in the world , it is the @entity44			1
" in particular , @entity1 became an outspoken advocate of efforts to tackle @entity3 's worsening @entity57 and @entity58 epidemic , criticizing his presidential successor and longtime @entity61 comrade @entity60 in 2002 for his government 's prevarication in combating the disease			1
" this is a war			0
it has killed more people than has been the case in all previous wars and in all previous natural disasters , " @entity1 said			0
" we must not continue to be debating , to be arguing , when people are dying			0
" @entity1 also set up the @entity58 charity 46664 -- named after @entity1 's prison number during his long incarceration on @entity76 -- inviting stars such as @entity78 and @entity79 to perform at a fundraising concert in @entity81 in 2003			2
@entity1 had personal reasons for promoting the fight against hiv / aids			1
in 2005 , he announced that his son , @entity85 , had died of an @entity58 - related illness at the age of 54			0
" let us give publicity to hiv / aids and not hide it , because the only way to make it appear like a normal illness like @entity93 , like cancer , is always to come out and to say somebody has died because of hiv / aids -- and people will stop regarding it as something extraordinary , " @entity1 said			1
@entity1 had endured health problems of his own , having been diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2001 , but , he remained active throughout his 80s and continued to travel the world			2
in 2007 , he formed @entity104 , a group of widely respected former statesmen and world leaders dedicated to bringing their expertise , experience and moral authority to bear on the world 's most pressing political and social issues			1

@entity1 celebrated his birthday at home in @entity127 , delivering a simple message drawing attention to the continuing gap between rich and poor in @entity3 : " poverty has gripped our people			0
if you are poor , you are not likely to live long			0
" in an interview with @entity137 to mark the occasion , @entity135 told @entity0 her husband 's only regret was that he had n't had the chance to raise his children and spend more time with his loved ones			0
on the day in 2004 when @entity3 won the right to host the @entity34 , @entity1 , a keen sports fan whose support for the @entity148 at the @entity149 was seen as a defining moment in the birth of the post-apartheid " @entity152 , " summed up his excitement by saying he " felt like a boy of 15			0
" apartheid was a policy of segregation and discrimination that aimed to keep black and white apart in every sphere of life			0
but the eagerly anticipated tournament brought private tragedy for @entity1 's family when his 13 - year - old great - granddaughter , @entity164 , was killed in a car accident while returning from a concert on the eve of the opening match			1
@entity1 made a last public appearance at the @entity171 final , smiling and waving to football fans at @entity174 's @entity173 on july 11 , 2010			2
to the end of his life , @entity1 remained loyally committed to the @entity61 , appearing on stage with party leader @entity178 in 2009 during his successful campaign for the presidency			2
most of all , @entity1 remained committed to the principle of dialogue -- and the belief , based on his own experiences , that even the most intractable problems could only be solved by enemies sitting down around a table to talk to each other .			0

@entity1 pushed issues on the world 's stage
among them were hiv / aids epidemic
sometimes , former president spoke *bluntly*
