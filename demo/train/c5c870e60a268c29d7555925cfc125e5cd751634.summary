at their peak on monday evening , they numbered as many as 170,000 , lt. gen. @entity14 , the nation 's security chief , said tuesday			1
but many of the demonstrators have since returned to their homes in the @entity0 area , @entity14 said			1
about 60,000 of them stayed out on the streets overnight , he said , sleeping under tents and mosquito nets			1
the protesters , who aim to keep demonstrating for a month , occupied seven main intersections and blocked one government office on monday			1
they say they intend to march to several other ministries , close more intersections and cut off electricity and water supplies at some government offices			2
it 's all part of an effort dubbed " @entity0 shutdown			1
" it 's orchestrated by the @entity38 protest group , led by @entity39 , a former deputy prime minister for the opposition @entity40			1

about 20,000 security personnel kept watch throughout the city			0
but so far , the shutdown has gone without serious incident			0
the government has offered talks with protesters and other concerned parties to discuss a way out and way to postpone the election , but @entity39 has rejected the offer			2
urging caution rights groups and others have called on @entity1 authorities and anti-government protesters to respect human rights and avoid violence during the mass demonstrations			1
since the anti-government protests began in november , eight people have died and 470 have been injured , authorities said			2
" the situation in @entity1 is tense , volatile and unpredictable , " @entity82 , @entity84 's @entity83 deputy director , said last week			1
" there is a real risk of loss of life and injury unless human rights are fully respected			0

travel warnings in a bid to cool tensions , @entity96 dissolved the nation 's parliament in december and called for new elections to be held on february 2			2

ambitious goal protest leaders have said they want to rid @entity1 of the influence of former prime minister @entity168 , the older brother of @entity96			1
that 's an ambitious goal in a country where every election since 2001 has been won by parties affiliated with @entity168 , a billionaire who built his political success on populist policies that appealed to @entity1 's rural heartland			2
@entity168 was ousted in a military coup in 2006 and has spent most of the time since then in exile overseas			0
if he returns , he risks a two - year prison sentence on a corruption conviction , which he says was politically motivated			0
the recent protests in @entity0 were prompted by a botched attempt by @entity96 's government to pass an amnesty bill that would have opened the door for her brother 's return			1
that move added fuel for critics who accuse her of being nothing more than her brother 's puppet , an allegation she has repeatedly denied			0

@entity168 's traditional support comes from the populous rural areas of north and northeast @entity1			2
