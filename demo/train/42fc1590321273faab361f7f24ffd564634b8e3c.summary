-- during a recent trip to @entity3 , i was reminded of my childhood and the challenges i have had to overcome			1
i grew up in western @entity6 , in the @entity7 , where i distinctly remember the atmosphere of unrest that came with two coups d'etats			2
in flashbacks , i remember my mother carrying me on her back as we fled @entity15 , the capital of @entity7 , while gunshots and screams filled the air			2
@entity3 , which became independent in 2011 , is facing many challenges			1
after three generations that have known only violence , the country still has unresolved conflicts with its northern neighbor @entity3			1
but the internal conflicts and civil unrest fueled by readily available weapons are raging at the borders of this young and largely ignored nation			1
basic needs the developed world takes for granted are hard to come by in @entity3			1
too many kids ca n't afford to go to school -- especially the girls -- and there are not enough trained teachers for the few kids who are able to get an education			0
clean water and food are hard to obtain			0
on top of that , the lack of security and protection makes it a struggle for families to fend for themselves			0
i visited villages where cows are like money in the bank , an indication of status and wealth			0
they are offered as the price for marriage when men are looking for a wife			0
this has led to a cultural tradition of cattle raiding by men who want to increase their herd			0
cattle raids have been going on for generations between communities , but now , with an ever - expanding and unchecked arms trade , the men are using guns instead of spears for their raids			2
with not enough police , and inadequate or nonexistent medical facilities , you can imagine the devastation			0
it felt like a @entity80 movie set to see young boys carrying @entity82 's , and girls not much older than my own daughters nursing their own babies			0
i heard stories of young girls who were raped and then forced to marry their rapist			0
how can this be real ? if my family had not exhausted their limited finances to send me to @entity93 to receive an education , would i have also picked up an @entity82 ? there are no easy solutions , and ultimately , the government of @entity3 has to take responsibility to protect its people			1
but there is something we all can do right now			0
a strong @entity103 will help restrict the flow of weapons and bullets to conflict - riddled countries like @entity3			1
negotiations are taking place right now at the @entity110 to bring such a treaty to fruition			2
such a treaty would make it harder for cattle raiders to attack communities like the ones i visited , and harder for small disputes between villages and tribes to end in bloodshed			1
the government of @entity3 has been conducting campaigns to disarm civilians , but this will not be effective if weapons are still easily accessible			1
weapons have been flooding into nations like @entity3 for decades			1
although the situation might seem hopeless , there is hope			0
i saw unbelievable strength and dignity in the eyes of the people i met in @entity3			1
i was surprised by this in every village i visited			0
after all they have endured , they press on for a future they fought and bled for			0
a future that they believe in			0
a future that all of us can help support			2
a future that we have an inherent obligation to support			2
it 's time for governments around the world to stand up for @entity151 right and make the world a safer place by agreeing to a robust @entity103			1
