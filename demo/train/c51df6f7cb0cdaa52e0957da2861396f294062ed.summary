-- four - time @entity2 kings @entity3 gave @entity5 wannabes @entity6 a heavy dose of reality when winning 2 - 0 at the @entity9 on tuesday			1
the victory in the first leg of their last 16 clash was one of two impressive away performances as @entity17 side @entity16 thumped @entity18 4 - 0 in @entity19			1
both @entity3 and @entity16 will now be strongly fancied to make april 's quarterfinals			1
the buildup to the @entity6 - @entity3 game had been notable for comments made by @entity25 coach @entity24 , formerly in charge of @entity27 , who said @entity3 had their worst team for " many years			1
" nonetheless , they still fielded players of the caliber of @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 and @entity37 , with @entity38 -- who is returning from injury -- on the bench			2
former @entity41 man @entity37 was in no doubt that his team had delivered a reminder of their qualities in @entity46			0
" we are top of the league , we had a great result tonight and we are in the final of the @entity51 -- there is nothing more you can ask for , " said the 26 - year - old			2
" maybe we had to prove a point in a way but we did it -- and we did it in style			0
" some people have been talking a bit too much , as usual , and hopefully this might have to shut up for a few days			0
" after a lacklustre first half , @entity3 took the lead through a @entity33 penalty earned after @entity6 's @entity66 had been shown the red card for a professional foul			1
despite playing with ten men for 37 minutes , @entity6 had their moments to equalize -- notably through a @entity72 volley -- but they were underdone by a sucker punch when @entity74 doubled the visitors ' lead late on			1
the result means @entity79 's side must score at least twice in the @entity80 to have any chance of progress			0
@entity3 knocked out @entity16 in the quarterfinals last season but the @entity17 side have been in ominous form in recent weeks and turned the screw on hosts leverkusen from the third minute			1
" tonight , we re-found our collective power , as if it was at the beginning of the season , " @entity16 coach @entity89 told @entity17 tv station @entity90			2
" you may point out @entity18 's weakness but i would rather note the @entity16 performance tonight			1
we played as a great team , both individually and collectively			0
" the squad is in a very , very good state of mind and i also want to congratulate those who came off the bench			0
" i really have many options to make my starting line - up , everyone is motivated and focused			0
" despite lying second in the @entity104 , @entity18 have been in poor form , having lost five of their last seven games			2
they got off to the worst start possible when captain @entity109 ceded possession to @entity111 who slotted home moments later after a neat exchange of passes			0
with a fair degree of inevitability , @entity115 then took center stage			2
three minutes after converting a penalty , the @entity119 fired home a stunning long - range effort to give his side a 3 - 0 halftime lead			1
his brace takes him to 10 goals in the @entity5 , one more than @entity127 whose @entity27 side do n't play @entity129 until next week			1
like @entity6 , @entity18 were also reduced to ten men as defender @entity131 , who had conceded the penalty earlier , was sent off in the 59th minute			1
yet @entity16 only scored once more after that as new signing @entity132 , who joined the club from @entity135 last month , capped the scoring two minutes from time			2
" we lost heart , we were too nervous , " shell - shocked defender @entity137 told @entity138			0
" they walked all over us			0
it was a shame for the fans			0
" on wednesday , the next two matches of a staggered last 16 phase take place when @entity41 host defending champions @entity147 and @entity150 travel to seven - time winners @entity151 .			0

@entity3 and @entity16 take major *strides* towards @entity5 quarterfinals
goals from @entity33 and @entity74 hand @entity3 a 2 - 0 victory at @entity6
@entity115 scores twice as @entity16 register 4 - 0 win at @entity18
