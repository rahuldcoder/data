-- thanks to the scary stalkability we 've all given ourselves on the ' net , " whatever happened to him / her ? " has all but toppled out of our dialogue			0
if a shadow of the past flits across your mind , and you have an idle moment , say , in the dentist 's office amid the smell of plastic and the squeal of drills , you pull out your smartphone , perform a search ( heck , with the @entity20 app you just hold it up to your mouth and mumble a few relevant words of caveman speak ) , and ... voila ! mystery solved			0
the trickiness , though , crops up when you decide to actually contact one of these people			1
i 'm not talking about the former seventh - grade lab partner you idly friended thanks to a " people you may know " tip - off			1
no , i speak of the former relations you truly want to reintroduce to your life -- or at least to catch up with in earnest			0
we 're talking about the people whom , years ago , you 'd jump through all sorts of hoops to reach -- calling up a mutual friend , asking said friend to sift through their well - thumbed @entity44 for your long lost friend 's number , copying it down and then ( gasp ! ) calling , unexpectedly , to get back in touch			1
about 70 % of people have used the web for re-knotting old ties , according to a survey from @entity53			1
you only get one chance to make a second impression			0
@entity56 , a few tips for blissful e-reunions with the following bygone buds			0
an old bff you and @entity61 used to be so close ... braiding each other 's hair at sleepovers , giggling over prank calls to classmates and teachers , sharing a packed hotel room on that bizarre high school band trip to @entity70 when @entity61 's boyfriend got in major trouble for the incident involving cough syrup and late - night shenanigans			0
but , anyway ! if you are n't already @entity76 - ed - ly connected with an old pal , sending a request with a sweet note about how you 'd love to catch up is a good bet			1
that way , when he or she accepts , you can get a life snapshot in a two - minute perusal of his or her profile , and have a million pleasant questions at the ready for your eventual long - awaited phone call or coffee date			0
if you 're already @entity76 official but have n't spoken in years , pluck her address off the site and send a legit e-mail			1
the extra step makes your query feel more genuine and less " i came across your face and am on a boring date , busying myself with my @entity101 while this bozo waits in line for the bathroom			0
" a @entity105 reaching into your past for professional reasons ? it would n't be awkward if you 'd kept it up with the ( yes , admittedly exhausting ) rigamarole of real - life networking -- exchanging occasional e-mails , breaking bread together now and then , sending a pleasant nondenominational holiday card in december , etc. as it is , though , we all lose touch with the occasional stellar colleague , and rebuilding the bridge need n't feel like a slimy attempt to use the old contact ( to mix metaphors galore )			1
check out your old work friend 's @entity126 profile ; if it says he 'd like to be contacted for " getting back in touch , " then congratulations , he 's asking for it			0
a simple @entity126 connection is fine if you want a passive , place - holding relationship , but if you really want to move things back into the real world , a polite , professional e-mail will do			1
if you do n't hear back right away , wait at least three or four weeks and patiently follow up			1
this year , corporate e-mail users will send and receive an average of 192 e-mails per day , according to research firm @entity141 , so do n't take it personally if yours take a few ( spaced out ) tries to find solid ground			1
eventually , your understated guilt trip will pay off in spades -- or at least in a comped business lunch			0
an ex let 's talk intentions real quick : if you 're contacting your former flame because you 're ( a ) bored and hoping he / she might stupidly hook up with you again or ( b ) with a new partner and hoping some casual chatting will lead to an opportunity to gloat ... gross			2
if you really do feel like it 'd be pleasant to hear from that cool girl / guy you dated before you moved and split amiably , well , ok then			0
( this bears repeating , though : we 've heard from our fair share of readers who are freaked out by an ex 's insistence on staying in their lives , so tread lightly )			0
e-mail is your best option by far			2
( i guess a phone call could also work , but this is a column about social networking			0
) yes , you might even have to go so far as asking a mutual friend for an e-mail address			1
do n't pour your heart out in an initial missive ; just say hello , non-creepily explain why they 've been on your mind , and see if they respond			2
see , e-mail is noninvasive and its reach is finite ; a @entity76 friend request begs for a long - term commitment , whereby you 'll be popping up in each other 's news feeds for years to come , until one of you severs the ties that bind a second time			1
and is n't a fear of commitment what splintered your young love in the first place ? worse still is following an ex on @entity195 , particularly if he or she has unprotected tweets			2
after the way - out - of - left - field " your ex is following you on @entity195 " e-mail , he 's left picturing you reading his bi-hourly updates , catching constant glimpses into his life			2
and blocking you is n't really an option , since the rest of the @entity207 is free to read his tweets at will			2
that 's the funny thing about the web : we love imagining that our friends and interested strangers are eating up our every word ; we also like to pretend that privacy will magically settle in a veil over the random unsavory characters of our past and present			1
neither thing is true , but the only way to figure out which camp your target will put you in is to stick out your hand and hope it gets a friendly shake back .			0

about 70 % of people have used the web for *reknotting* old ties
for old friends , get e-mail address off of @entity76 and send a legit *message*
*reconnecting* with an ex ? ask yourself , what are your intentions ?
do n't expect to be fascinating to the " right " people or *invisible* to the " *wrong* " people
