@entity0 , @entity1 -- the patients limp into a two - story house standing on the fringes of @entity7 's brutal conflict			1
they are victims whose bodies have been mutilated by the war			1
but this charity is giving some @entity7 a second chance at life			1
it is helping survivors take their first steps on the long road toward recovery			2
part workshop , part physical therapy clinic , the @entity20 manufactures artificial legs			1
it also helps amputee victims train their bodies to walk on these new limbs			1
among the patients here is @entity28 , who gingerly takes his first steps on a new prosthetic leg			2
his left leg was blown off above the knee a year ago by an explosion in the battleground city of @entity35			2
a network of purple scars riddle his right leg while he says he still has shrapnel lodged in the skin of his back			2
several @entity7 technicians use screw drivers to adjust the knee joint of @entity28 's prosthesis as the patient tests the balance on the limb			1
" they brought back hope			2
they brought back self esteem			2
they brought back life , " @entity28 says , pointing at the young men who help him			1
" my life was a tragedy before i put this limb on			1
" it can take months of physical therapy and a succession of different prostheses before patients ' bodies can adjust to walking on new limbs			1
" the first and second limbs are temporary , " said @entity65 , a @entity7 who runs the prosthetic limb project			1
" the third or fourth become permanent			2
" @entity28 made the difficult , sometimes dangerous journey from @entity35 to this @entity1 border town to try on this third generation of prosthetic limb			0
the leg has allowed @entity28 to go back to his job as a metal worker			0
more importantly , he adds , " i can put my own son on my leg and pull him up , thank @entity78			0
" at the charity , craftsmen grind metal on lathes and sculpt , and bake plaster for new limbs			1
funded in large part by @entity7 expatriates , the project 's directors say it has provided limbs and therapy for free for more than 350 patients			1
the project is more affordable because technicians adopted the " @entity95 , " an artificial limb developed in @entity97 that is far cheaper than some other prosthetic models			1
among the young people working at the facility is @entity101 , a slender , red - haired teenager			0
@entity101 is not just an employee			0
the 18 - year old is also a victim of the war , and has his own prosthetic leg			0
he says he was strafed with fire from an anti-aircraft gun a year ago as he and his family were traveling up a road in a pick - up truck			0
the boy who once loved to play soccer says he ended up in a hospital bed in @entity1 , begging to have his mangled leg amputated because of the pain			0
eventually , infection set in , and @entity101 says doctors removed his left leg above the knee			0
the tall teen moves quickly with a slight limp , even climbing and descending stairs			0
" sometimes we receive patients who are completely destroyed emotionally , " @entity101 says			0
" i can give the patient answers because i have lived their lives			0
i tell them i have a prosthetic limb and thank @entity78 i am here to tell you that you can go on and continue your life like any normal person			1
yes , you may not get back to exactly how you were before the injury , but you will be able to walk again			1
" despite these brave words , @entity101 privately confesses to having doubts			0
he fears that no woman will ever want to marry a man mutilated by war			0
this organization has gone a long way toward healing physical wounds left by the conflict			0
the emotional and mental damage , however , may prove much harder to cure .			0
