@entity0 -- it is the label that sends chills through the @entity4 : judicial activist , shorthand for members of the bench who put politics and partisanship above respect for @entity12 , the @entity13 , and the power of precedent			1
the justices are used to such rhetorical slings from lawmakers and political commentators , but not from one of their own			0
but justice @entity22 in recent weeks has laid down the accusation on her conservative colleagues , and it threatens to raise tensions as the court begins its new term on monday			1
the docket may not be the blockbuster of the past two years -- where healthcare reform , voting rights , and gay marriage grabbed headlines -- but a range of hot - button issues will keep the nine - member bench busy			1
" the possibilities for changes in the law are even greater this term , because there is an array of cases where conservatives might overrule or significantly undercut more liberal precedents , " said @entity38 , publisher of @entity40 , and a leading @entity0 appellate attorney			2
among the petitions the court will address : affirmative action and whether states violate the @entity13 when passing laws banning racial preferences in college admissions and job hiring			1
legislative prayer and the responsibility of states to accommodate a variety of faiths to speak in a public forum			2
a " separation of powers " political fight between the president and @entity12 over recess appointments			0
and more cases may soon be added : whether search warrants are needed before police can look at your cellphone data			0
can business exempt themselves from parts of the healthcare reform law on religious freedom grounds ? activist court ? the court 's eldest justice gave several print interviews over the summer , a rarity for a member of the bench not promoting a book or extracurricular project			1
@entity22 told the @entity89 this was this " was one of the most activist courts in history			1
" she clarified her remarks to @entity96 : " if you take activism to mean readiness to strike down laws passed by @entity12 , i think the current court will go down in history as one of the most activist courts in that regard			1
" the 80 - year - old justice was particularly concerned about the court 's june ruling to gut the key enforcement provision of the @entity109			1
section 5 gave the federal government coverage power over states with a past history of discrimination -- requiring those jurisdictions to get @entity0 's prior approval before any changes in their voting laws -- including voter id and early registration			2
in her powerful dissent , read from the bench , the senior member of the court 's unofficial liberal wing called the majority decision " hubris			1
" " after exhaustive evidence - gathering and deliberative process , @entity12 reauthorized the @entity109 , including the coverage provision , with overwhelming bipartisan support " in 2006 , she wrote			0
" in my judgment , the court errs egregiously by overriding @entity12 ' decision			2
" the @entity135 has since sued @entity136 and @entity137 over their voting procedures , using another part of the law that could make it considerably harder for federal officials to prove discriminatory intent			0
but on a larger stage , @entity22 's recent comments have reignited a longstanding debate over the role of judges -- and whether chief justice @entity149 and his fellow conservatives have a long - term strategy to selectively tilt the court to the right -- in areas like affirmative action , election financing , and business regulation			1
" i think that @entity22 is picking up on something the @entity162 people have picked up on as well -- the @entity4 conservatives might be stepping over their bounds , " said @entity158 , chief counsel at the progressive @entity159			1
" @entity22 is pointing out that the conservatives are in fact what we might call activists -- going beyond what the law requires to have a more conservative ideological agenda			1
" ' sour grapes ' but other legal observers have suggested @entity22 is inappropriately shedding her judicial robes for the politician 's microphone			1
some conservatives call it a form of " sour grapes " -- attacking the result only when you lose			0
" her criticism was based on impressionistic claims that do n't pan out , " said @entity184 , policy director at the conservative @entity185			0
" she was looking to find a way to characterize her disagreement with some of her colleagues , but unfortunately disagreeing with someone does n't make them an activist			0
" so how do the eight years of the @entity194 stack up when it comes to its record of overturning acts of @entity12 ? figures compiled by @entity1 -- with help from @entity40 and the @entity201 -- found 12 cases since 2005 where such laws were completely struck down , or about 1.5 per term			2
the 19 years under chief justice @entity205 ( 1986 - 05 ) and the 17 under @entity206 ( 1969 - 86 ) averaged about two per term			2
but quantity may not be the accurate measure , since some laws -- and the rulings themselves -- have far greater political and policy impact than others			0
progressives point to those high - profiled decisions -- the @entity109 case three months ago , and the 2010 " @entity218 " case loosening a century of federal restrictions on corporate spending by " independent " groups like businesses and unions			0
" conservatives have tried to get the courts to strike down laws that were passed by @entity12 but by which they disagree -- their campaign finance cases , regulations about air pollution control , environmental protection , " said @entity158			0
" and so , we see this sort of de-regulatory agenda that conservatives are now pushing through the courts , when they 've failed to win through the political process			0
" @entity22 actually sided with the majority in half of the one dozen rulings knocking down federal laws -- including the landmark june opinion favoring homosexual rights			1
' no regrets ' in the so - called @entity248 appeal , the court tossed out a major part of the federal @entity250 -- which defined it as only between one man and one woman			2
social conservatives expressed their displeasure			0
" @entity22 in fact is one who does that more often than other justices , " ruling against the will of @entity12 , said @entity256			1
" this is the court that upheld @entity262 on fairly specious grounds , and it 's in the process of redefining marriage			1
it 's absolutely absurd to say that this court is coming to any conservative results regularly			1
maybe it 's not as far left as @entity22 wants , but we 're seeing a court where she 's getting her way much of the time already			1
" friends of @entity22 privately say she has no regrets with her more outspoken tone			1
she has long had the reputation as brilliant jurist , with a fierce , exacting intellect			0
but now , say associates , this diminutive , soft - spoken grandmother is clearly finding her voice in recent years , accepting of her stature as the public face of a more progressive view of the law and constitutional limits			0
she calls herself the " heir to that role " of senior justice in the minority once held by @entity291			0
her candor may also serve another purpose , a blunt message to the left : back off			0
her age and recent ill health -- she is a two - time cancer survivor -- have prompted some liberal activists to demand @entity22 step down from the bench now , to give president @entity300 a third opportunity to keep the seat in liberal hands for perhaps decades to come			1
the president has said he has a " soft spot " for @entity22 , but she has made clear that will not affect her decision about when to retire			1
" there will come a point when i -- it 's not this year ... as long as i think i have the candlepower , i will do it			2
and i figure next year for certain			0
after that , who knows ? " she told @entity1 senior legal analyst @entity313 in a @entity315 profile this past spring			0
and a more coy observation , when telling the @entity89 , " there will be a president after this one , and i 'm hopeful that that president will be a fine president , " she said			0
it is an oft - quoted refrain on the law and society -- @entity327 commentator @entity326 's observation that , " there is hardly a political question in the @entity162 which does not sooner or later turn into a judicial one			1
" @entity331 divided after eight often turbulent years , the @entity149 court shows little sign of moving dramatically away from where it essentially is now : four more conservative justices , four who are more liberal , and a moderate - conservative in justice @entity338 , who often tilts the balance			1
this court is conservative , but it can be argued , not radically so			2
but given the increasingly partisan tone overtaking @entity0 -- and the current government shutdown is only the latest chapter -- even this institution finds it harder to stay immune from eroding public confidence			0
@entity162 ' opinion about the @entity4 is split down the middle , with 48 % saying in a june @entity1 / @entity350 survey they approve of how the court is handling its job and 48 % saying they disapprove			1
just a year earlier , a majority -- 53 % approved			0
prior years had the numbers in the 70 % range			0
" among the justices themselves , there is still an incredible confidence that each of them is deciding the cases neutrally without politics intruding , " said @entity38			0
" and the public generally thinks that 's true too			2
but because there have been so many recent high - profile difficult cases , political partisans tend to paint the court -- caricature it -- as a political tool			2
that 's not right but it is undermining political confidence and support for the justices			2
" but as far as any hard feelings on battles lost , and on words said , do not expect any lingering bitterness inside the court			2
@entity22 and her colleagues have already returned to work from their summer recess , met privately as a group this week , and seem prepared for the hectic round of arguments and opinion writing that starts the @entity389 in october			1
" we could not do the job the @entity13 gives to us , if we did not use one of @entity396 's favorite expressions : ' get over it , ' " @entity22 said to a @entity391 audience recently			1
" even though we have sharp disagreements on what the @entity13 means , we have a trust			0
we revere the @entity13 and the court -- and we want to make sure it was in as good shape when we joined			0
