-- scenes from the mass shooting in an @entity4 , @entity5 , movie theater are horrific , but are all too familiar in the @entity6			2
some have argued that gun control is irrelevant to mass shootings because the perpetrators are typically so determined that they will overcome any legal hurdle to acquiring firearms			1
however , mass murderers often use assault weapons or guns with large ammunition capacity			1
opinion : gun control or carry permits wo n't stop mass murder one of the guns @entity22 allegedly used to shoot 70 people within minutes was an assault rifle with a 100 - round drum magazine			1
this extraordinary firepower enables gunmen to kill and wound more victims than they otherwise could if they used weapons that held fewer bullets			0
there is obviously no need for any civilian to have such powerful weapons			1
rational gun policy , one that puts public safety ahead of the interests of the gun industry and gun enthusiasts , would ban firearms and ammunition clips that hold more than 10 rounds			1
such a policy might not prevent many of our mass shootings , but it should reduce the number of victims from these incidents			1
skeptics might point to the federal assault weapons ban ( a section of the 1994 @entity54 ) that @entity55 let expire in 2004 as a failure that did not affect overall homicide rates			0
however , the law 's impact was limited by its narrowness that made it easy for gun manufacturers to evade			0
a broad ban on the sale and possession of high capacity ( more than 10 rounds ) ammunition magazines with stiff penalties would translate into saved lives			2
between 9,000 and 10,000 people are murdered each year with guns in the @entity6 , most garnering little attention			0
local news coverage of such events typically provides scant information or context to enable citizens to understand the role of guns in these incidents			0
invariably , the only time that gun violence and gun policy are discussed in the national media is after a horrific shooting rampage			1
we should not brush aside discussions of gun policy as too politically difficult to expect meaningful change , or " the price for our freedoms			0
" instead , we should reflect on why the @entity6 has a murder rate that is nearly seven times higher than the average murder rate in other high - income countries and a nearly 20 times higher murder rate with guns			0
and we should consider how flaws in current gun policies contribute to this disparity			0
standards for legal ownership and permits to carry a concealed gun are relatively lax in the @entity6 in most states , a person with a long history of arrests and convictions for misdemeanors ( often pleaded down from felony charges ) , prior restraining orders for domestic violence and history of drug and alcohol abuse can own as many military - style weapons as he can afford to purchase , and can legally carry concealed guns almost anywhere			2
opinion : when will @entity6 wake up to gun violence ? under federal law , anyone wanting to purchase a firearm from a licensed gun dealer must pass a background check			1
but in most states , the gun dealer who stands to profit from a gun sale , rather than a law enforcement agency , determines the authenticity of purchasers ' identification cards			0
gun dealers face little consequence if they fail to account for dozens of guns upon inspection			0
data indicating which gun dealers sell the most guns linked to crimes are kept from public view and can not be used in decisions about the dealer 's license			0
illogically , federal law and most state gun laws allow firearm purchases from private sellers with no background check or questions asked			0
as a result of these policies , it is far too easy for dangerous people to own , carry and ultimately use guns			0
following mass shootings , gun control opponents have not been bashful about pushing for laws to remove restrictions on carrying guns in schools , bars and churches			1
indeed , calls for removing restrictions on carrying concealed firearms will not stop mass shootings			1
research indicates that so - called right - to - carry laws do n't reduce violence , and may increase aggravated assaults			2
but studies i have conducted indicate that stricter regulations of gun sales , whether by retail dealers or by private sellers , are associated with fewer guns diverted to criminals			1
moreover , national national surveys show that a large majority of citizens favor these reforms to our gun laws , including most gun owners			2
in addition , there is substantial research showing that law enforcement strategies that focus on deterring illegal gun possession reduce violent crime			2
public health initiatives in @entity193 and @entity194 , which use reformed ex-gang - members to reach out to youth , mediate disputes and promote alternatives to violence , have also been shown to significantly reduce homicides and shootings			2
more than 30,000 people die every year from guns in the @entity6 , and more than 400,000 are victims of nonfatal crime committed with guns			0
the economic costs are staggering -- an estimated $ 100 billion annually			0
only a small fraction of these deaths are connected to mass shootings			1
but the mounting deaths and associated trauma from mass shootings should motivate us to take action to make needed reforms to our gun laws , focus law enforcement resources on combating illegal gun possession and invest in prevention initiatives proven to reduce gun violence			1
@entity6 's high rate of gun violence is shameful			1
when will we change ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity224 .			2

some people argue that gun control is irrelevant to mass shootings
@entity230 : but mass murderers often use firearms with large ammunition capacity
he says there is no need for any civilian to have such powerful weapons
@entity224 : we need stricter regulations of gun sales to reduce death by gun violence
