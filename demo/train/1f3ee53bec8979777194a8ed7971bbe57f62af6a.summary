the @entity2 and @entity3 hail from two of the finest craft beer regions in the @entity6 @entity7 is home to @entity8 , the largest - selling craft beer company in the country , as well as some smaller , notable breweries like @entity12 and @entity13 @entity14 was one of the key players in starting the microbrew revolution , partly because of its proximity to fresh hops in the nearby @entity20			1
one of the leaders of that revolution was @entity22 , now famous for its creative pumpkin beers and flagship @entity24			2
just last week , @entity22 announced that @entity26 bought the company to further expand its craft portfolio			1
so , for better or worse , you 're likely to start seeing much more from this craft beer forefather			1
in fact , @entity31 and @entity7 's @entity32 have set up a friendly wager for @entity35 sunday : three kegs of beer from each brewery will be poured in the opposite breweries ' taprooms the week after the big game			1
the loser will be required to fly the flag of the winning team until the beer is gone			1
in keeping with that friendly competitive spirit , let 's break down the roster of these two craft beer cities			1
the quarterback is the leader of the team and , in many instances , the most recognizable name to viewers			2
this brew must define what the city is all about and be the no. 1 " draft " pick at the local sports bar			2
@entity60 -- the @entity61 ; @entity14 , @entity62 just blocks from the iconic @entity64 , @entity63 is one of the oldest and most respected breweries in @entity62			1
its @entity60 , much like the @entity35 , has a fondness for roman numerals			0
it 's the quintessential @entity14 beer with rich chocolate and espresso flavors , because what would @entity14 be without its coffee ? @entity74 -- @entity75 ; @entity7 , @entity76 , and @entity77 , @entity78 since 1993 , @entity32 's hoppy pale ale has been a @entity81 staple			1
this style of beer is right out of the @entity85 playbook , but @entity86 was one of the first to produce an @entity24 on the @entity87			1
these brews are among the most widely available from each region , but still great representations of the area			0
if you 're looking to cheer on a particular team but do not live in the @entity7 or @entity14 area , you can still most likely catch one of these brews at your local store			1
@entity98 -- @entity8 ; @entity7 , @entity76 @entity8 @entity98 is the most widely recognized craft beer in the country			1
it 's crisp , refreshing and arguably the most " patriotic " beer you can find			2
@entity104 -- @entity105 ; @entity106 , @entity62 while @entity105 makes its home in @entity106 , it also has a brew house in @entity110 , @entity111 , which is about an hour 's drive from @entity7			0
this pale ale is fairly low in alcohol , and thus a pleasing session brew , meaning you can drink a few over the course of a game and not get inebriated			0
do n't call an audible -- stock up on this one			0
these brews might be stars locally , but they have n't received much national attention ... yet			0
their scope is still pretty small , but they are hitting the gym and building a pretty strong following among local craft beer fans			1
@entity127 -- @entity129 's @entity128 ; @entity130 , @entity76 @entity129 's @entity128 is a unique craft brewer that specializes in lagers			2
some craft beer snobs might think lagers are boring , but @entity129 's @entity128 gets pretty inventive with the style			1
one standout is @entity127 , a double @entity138 pale lager that is hopped - up , crisp and drinkable			0
@entity139 -- @entity140 ; @entity141 , @entity62 @entity140 has been producing some of the best brews in the state , and its @entity139 is an all - out winner			0
it combines the nutty , malty characteristics of an @entity146 brown ale with the coffee flavors of a porter			0
the @entity35 calls for times to be bold and take a chance			0
a little divine intervention does n't hurt either			0
same goes for your beer			2
@entity155 -- @entity156 ; @entity155 , @entity76 @entity76 is home to the only @entity158 brewery in the @entity6			0
the monks of @entity162 brew this @entity163 - style " table beer " sustainably and consume the fruits of their labors only on sunday evenings , which is impeccable timing for the big game			2
@entity168 -- @entity169 ; @entity170 , @entity62 @entity168 is bitter , loaded with @entity171 hops and may not be pretty , but it will get you where you want to go			0
@entity169 has a number of delicious brews with air travel themes , like @entity176 and @entity177 , because founder and brewer @entity178 was a full - time airline employee before starting the brewery .			0
