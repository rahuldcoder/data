-- @entity1 avoided bariatric surgery for years			1
the registered dietician knew how to lose weight -- she had done it time and again , dropping more than 75 pounds before gaining it all back			0
" the difficulty was in maintaining that loss , " she says			0
" i 'd pretty much given up because it was just so heart - breaking			0
" @entity1 realized she could n't do it with diet and exercise alone			2
she was 5 - foot - 3 and 293 pounds , and she saw her weight as a professional embarrassment			0
she decided to undergo a gastric bypass procedure			1
within a week after surgery , @entity1 no longer had to take insulin for her type 2 diabetes			2
in a month , she was off her blood pressure medication			0
over the next several years @entity1 lost half her body weight , eventually settling at a comfortable 160 pounds			2
" bariatric surgery carries risk , just like any surgical procedure , " @entity1 says			1
" but i decided for me , the risk of staying at 293 pounds was also very high			0
" once feared by patients and denounced by primary care physicians , bariatric surgery has become more accepted as research shows it 's not only helping people lose weight , but also reducing their risk for cardiovascular disease and reversing type 2 diabetes			1
severely obese adults who undergo gastric bypass lose , on average , 90 pounds in the three years after surgery -- or 31 % of their initial weight , according to a study published today in the @entity40			1
those who have the adjustable gastric band , or lap - band , procedure lose about 44 pounds			2
previous research suggests some of these patients will gain back a portion of the weight over time , but the overall health benefits of bariatric surgery are appealing to many struggling with excess weight			1
" people lose sight of the fact that the patients are n't just obese , but they 're sick , " bariatric surgeon dr. @entity51 says			1
" it 's not as easy as just losing weight			0
" no longer a risky business twenty years ago , @entity51 performed the first laparoscopic gastric bypass procedure			1
it was 1993 , and up until that point bariatric surgery had been done through a large incision in the patient 's abdomen			1
doctors had to cut through a thick wall of fat , @entity51 says , creating an unstable wound that often led to infections , hernias and sometimes death			1
" it was big surgery on big patients , " says dr. @entity72 , president of the @entity73			1
" it really put on a stigma at that time			0
" @entity51 's ground - breaking operation changed all that			2
more than 90 % of bariatric procedures are now minimally invasive , and in - hospital mortality rates have dropped to 0.10 % , according to a 2011 study published in the @entity85			1
@entity72 says laparoscopic bariatric surgery is now as safe as or safer than gallbladder removal , one of the most routine surgical procedures in @entity90			1
fewer risks means less fear for obese patients , @entity72 says			0
in the early 1990s , approximately 16,000 people a year were undergoing bariatric surgery			1
by 2004 , that number had jumped to 135,985 cases per year , according to the 2011 @entity99 study			0
since then , surgeons have seen a steady number of patients , @entity72 says , although early numbers for 2013 suggest another uptick			0
physicians are also jumping on board as they see that bariatric surgery is about more than weight loss , @entity51 says			1
" we 're seeing more primary care doctors that truly understand the power of these operations , " he says			0
" i think society in general understands that this is the best treatment for metabolic syndrome			0
" how bariatric surgery works bariatric surgery works in two ways : by limiting the amount of food patients can consume and / or by preventing patients ' digestive systems from absorbing some nutrients			1
the procedures also affect the body 's metabolic hormones , such as ghrelin , which stimulate appetite			0
most people have heard of the @entity132 gastric bypass procedure , which was developed in the 1960s			1
with gastric bypass , doctors create a smaller stomach pouch that can hold only an ounce of food and connect it to a new section of the small intestine , bypassing part of that digestive organ			1
learning to eat again : man drops 130 pounds also popular is the adjustable gastric banding procedure , more commonly referred to as the lap - band			2
doctors place the lap - band around a portion of the patient 's stomach to create a smaller pouch , similar to the gastric bypass procedure			1
this band can then be tightened or loosened via a port below the skin of the patient 's abdomen			0
unlike the gastric bypass procedure , the lap - band is reversible			1
two other bariatric procedures are also performed in the @entity90			2
during a sleeve gastrectomy procedure , doctors remove 75 % of the patient 's stomach , creating a slim tube , or sleeve , that foods travels through			2
with a biliopancreatic diversion , a portion of the stomach is removed and the remaining tissue is connected to the lower portion of the small intestine			0
learn more about the different kinds of bariatric surgery doctors have discovered that gastric bypass procedures have a nearly immediate effect on patients with type 2 diabetes			1
the bypass reroutes the intestine , @entity72 explains , allowing food to hit a portion of the bowel that stimulates the pancreas , which then produces more insulin			0
" sometimes patients walk out of the hospital without medications , " he says			0
there is also data showing the sleeve , diversion and band can improve or put diabetes into remission , with varying degrees of success			0
treating a disease earlier this year , the @entity200 officially labeled obesity as a disease			0
many saw the @entity200 's decision as a step toward getting health insurance companies to accept bariatric surgery as a viable treatment for metabolic disorders like diabetes			1
although stigma around bariatric surgery has been reduced , it still exists , @entity1 says			1
" there 's still that feeling that it 's drastic , that it 's dangerous , " she says			0
" some people call it the easy way out			0
and there 's nothing easy about having your insides rerouted			0
" @entity51 wonders if we 'd have such a negative view of bariatric surgery if obesity was n't viewed as a lazy person 's disease			1
we would never judge someone going into surgery to have cancer removed , he says , so why do we judge those trying to reverse their diabetes or heart disease ? " the reality is the 10 - year survival rate for some individuals with metabolic disease is less than if they have some cancers , " he says			2
" i do n't think ( bariatric surgery ) is a radical treatment			1
i think it 's shown to be the best treatment			0
" if anything shows how perception is changing , @entity72 says , it 's the name of his professional organization			0
in 2007 , the @entity251 became the @entity251 , acknowledging the impact bariatric surgery can have on metabolic disorders			1
researchers around the globe are following bariatric patients to see if the effects of surgery stick			2
scientists in @entity261 have collected data on 2,000 patients for more than a decade			0
nearly 72 % of their bariatric patients were in remission for type 2 diabetes two years after surgery , compared to just 16.4 % of non-surgical weight loss patients			1
but 15 years later , only 31 % of the surgical patients were still in remission			2
while the researchers noted that this was still higher than the remission rate for those who had n't had surgery , their results illustrate an important point : " bariatric surgery is not a ' one size fits all ' approach to weight loss , " says dr. @entity276 , lead author of the new @entity40 study			1
courcoulas and her colleagues found their results varied widely between patients			2
more than 70 needed additional bariatric surgery after their first procedure ; three died in the month following a gastric bypass			1
more research is needed to determine which patients will be the most likely to benefit from bariatric surgery , the scientists say			1
" it 's not as predictable as we 'd like it to be , " @entity51 says			2
" it works well in some patients , does n't in others			2
we do n't really know who 's going to be a successful candidate			0
" all @entity1 knows is that she made the right choice for her			0
she 's been able to keep the weight off successfully for 10 years			0
" i was looking at a very shortened lifespan , " she says			0
" i have no doubt that i 'm going to live 10 , 15 years longer because i 've undergone this procedure			2
" @entity306 , son lose 260 pounds after weight loss surgery			0

20 years ago , dr. @entity51 performed the first laparoscopic gastric bypass procedure
now 90 % of bariatric surgeries are minimally invasive , making them safer for patients
approximately 135,000 people each year undergo bariatric surgery
results for these patients vary widely , and doctors are n't sure who will have success
