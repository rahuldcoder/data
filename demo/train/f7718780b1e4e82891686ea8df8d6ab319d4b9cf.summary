@entity2 striker @entity1 has been found guilty of racially abusing a @entity4 player in october , the @entity0 announced on tuesday			1
the @entity5 international was suspended for eight matches and fined Â£ 40,000 ( $ 63,000 ) after a seven - day hearing by an independent regulatory commission			1
he has 14 days to appeal the punishment , the @entity0 said			2
@entity4 's @entity12 , who is black , said the word @entity1 shouted repeatedly during the october 15 @entity15 match was a racial slur and demanded that @entity1 be held accountable			1
@entity2 issued a statement saying it was " very surprised and disappointed " with the decision			1
blog : footballers are tv stars , and should act like it ... " we find it extraordinary that @entity1 can be found guilty on the word of @entity12 alone when no - one else on the field of play -- including @entity12 's own @entity4 teammates and all the match officials -- heard the alleged conversation between the two players , " the club said			1
" we will study the details reasons of the commission once they become available , but reserve our right to appeal or take any other course of action we feel appropriate with regards to this situation			2
" @entity1 did not specify what he said , but has previously said it was n't offensive			2
" i did n't insult him			0
it was only a form of expressing myself			0
i called him something his own teammates from @entity45 call him , " @entity1 said , according to the @entity47 newspaper @entity46			2
one word with many meanings translates into sports controversy @entity52 media reports suggested @entity1 used the term " negrito			2
" scholars who have studied race issues in @entity56 say that such a term can have different meanings and connotations in different nations			0
generally , however , negrito is not considered a racial slur in @entity56 , said @entity63 , director of the @entity64 at the @entity65			0
" it 's often a term of endearment , " he said			0
but dr. @entity69 , a @entity70 who works in the @entity73 and @entity72 of @entity74 , told @entity75 that the term is not affectionate when it refers to strangers			0
in a post on his @entity80 page shortly after the match , @entity1 said he was upset by the allegations			1
" i can only say that i have always respected and respect everybody , " he said			0
" we are all the same			0
i go to the field with the maximum ( enthusiasm ) of a little child who enjoys what he does , not to create conflicts			0
" @entity12 , who is a @entity93 - born @entity92 citizen , said in an interview with @entity96 's @entity95 that evidence supported his claim			1
" there are cameras , " the former @entity96 national team captain said			0
" you can see him say a certain word to me at least 10 times			0
there is no place for that in 2011			0
" the commission found that @entity1 " used insulting words towards mr. @entity12 " and that those words " included a reference to mr. @entity12 's color , " the @entity0 statement said			1
@entity2 noted that in his written statement , even @entity12 said he did not believe @entity1 is racist			1
" @entity1 himself is of a mixed - race family background , as his grandfather was black , " the club said			1
it noted that @entity1 has been involved since the @entity120 in " a charitable project which uses sport to encourage solidarity amongst people of different backgrounds with the central theme that the colour of a person 's skin does not matter ... we do not recognize the way in which @entity1 has been characterized			1
" the club said it believes the @entity0 was " determined to bring charges against @entity1 , even before interviewing him at the beginning of november			1
nothing we have heard in the course of the hearing has changed our view that @entity1 is innocent of the charges against him and we will provide @entity1 with whatever support he now needs to clear his name			2

@entity1 's eight - match *ban* and fine is suspended pending any appeal
his club @entity2 expresses disappointment with the decision
