@entity1 gov. @entity0 signed a bill into law wednesday that abolishes the death penalty , making his state the 17th in the nation to abandon capital punishment and the fifth in five years to usher in a repeal			1
the law is effective immediately , though prospective in nature , meaning that it would not apply to those already sentenced to death			2
it replaces the death penalty with life in prison without the possibility of release as the state 's highest form of punishment			1
" although it is an historic moment -- @entity1 joins 16 other states and the rest of the industrialized world by taking this action -- it is a moment for sober reflection , not celebration , " @entity24 said in a statement			2
he added that the " unworkability " of @entity1 's death penalty law was a contributing factor in his decision			1
" in the last 52 years , only two people have been put to death in @entity1 -- and both of them volunteered for it , " @entity24 said			1
" instead , the people of this state pay for appeal after appeal , and then watch time and again as defendants are marched in front of the cameras , giving them a platform of public attention they do n't deserve			0
" this month , lawmakers in the state 's @entity53 passed the bill by a vote of 86 to 63			0
the @entity57 had approved it a week before			0
state lawmakers first tried to pass a similar bill in 2009 but were ultimately blocked by then - gov. @entity61 , a @entity62			2
capital punishment has existed in the @entity1 since its colonial days			0
but it was forced to review its death penalty laws beginning in 1972 , when a @entity68 decision required greater consistency in its application			1
a moratorium was then imposed until a 1976 decision by the high court upheld the constitutionality of capital punishment			0
since then , @entity1 juries have handed down 15 death sentences			2
of those , only one person has been executed , according to the @entity79 , a nonpartisan group that studies death penalty laws			1
@entity81 , a convicted serial killer , was put to death by lethal injection in 2005 after he voluntarily gave up his appeals			0
the state now has 11 people on death row			0
advocates of a repeal say that @entity1 's past law kept inmates -- who were often engaged in multiple appeals -- on death row for extended periods of time , costing taxpayers far more than if the convicts were serving a life sentence in the general prison population			2
they also point to instances in which wrongful convictions have been overturned with new investigative methods , including forensic testing			0
opponents of the repeal had said that capital punishment is a criminal deterrent that offers justice for victims and their families			0
in the last five years , @entity111 , @entity112 , @entity113 and @entity114 have repealed the death penalty			1
@entity117 voters will decide the issue in november .			1
