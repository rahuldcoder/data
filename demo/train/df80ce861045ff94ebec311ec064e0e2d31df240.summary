@entity0 -- protesters gathered in lower @entity4 mid-day sunday to demonstrate against plans to build a mosque near the site of @entity8 , where the twin towers of the @entity10 were destroyed by @entity12 hijackers on september 11 , 2001			1
protest organizer @entity13 , a conservative blogger , and her group , " stop the @entity16 , " planned the event because , according to the group 's website , " building the @entity8 mosque is not an issue of religious freedom , but of resisting an effort to insult the victims of 9/11 and to establish a beachhead for political @entity24 and @entity24 supremacism in @entity0 ... @entity8 is a war memorial , a burial ground			1
" @entity13 said the @entity31 and security at the rally told her about 5,000 demonstrators were there			2
but @entity31 spokesman sgt. @entity36 said the police department 's policy is to not provide crowd estimates and that he could not confirm @entity13 's number			2
@entity1 ireporter @entity41 , who attended the rally and sent photos to @entity1 , said the number was closer to 200 - 300 while he was there for the first 45 minutes of the event			2
all three said the protest was peaceful			1
human rights advocates , politicians and families of 9/11 victims addressed the crowd			2
both @entity13 and @entity41 said those family members elicited a powerful , emotional response from the protesters			2
@entity13 recently told @entity1 's @entity56 that no one 's telling the mosque 's planners they ca n't build it , but " we 're asking them not to			1
" " we feel it would be more appropriate maybe to build a center dedicated to expunging the @entity65 texts of the violent ideology that inspired jihad , or perhaps a center to the victims of hundreds of millions of years of jihadi wars , land enslavements , cultural annihilations and mass slaughter , " @entity13 said			1
the project calls for a 13 - story community center including a mosque , performing art center , gym , swimming pool and other public spaces			1
it is a collaboration between the @entity82 and the @entity83			2
the @entity83 aims to improve relations between @entity85 and the @entity86			2
" the @entity83 hopes to build a $ 100 million , 13 - story community center with @entity24 , interfaith and secular programming , similar to the @entity92 , " its website says , referring to the cultural institution on the upper east side of @entity4			1
@entity93 of the @entity82 told @entity1 it was a " community center with a prayer space inside			1
" she said the project was an opportunity for @entity99 muslims living in @entity0 to " give back " to the community			0
" there is a lot of ignorance about who @entity85 are			0
a center like this will be dedicated to removing that ignorance and it will also counter the extremists because moderate @entity85 need a voice , " she told @entity1			1
" their voices need to be amplified			0
" local political leaders turned out in support of the community last month after @entity113 of the conservative @entity114 reportedly said the mosque was for " the worship of the terrorists ' monkey - god			1
" " to make room for peace there can be no room for hatred , bigotry or prejudice , " city councilman @entity119 said at the may 20 demonstration			0
the project has the backing of the @entity130 of lower @entity4			0
it does not require city permission to go ahead			0
@entity133 : protests against mosque near @entity8 the plan has split people touched by the september 11 attacks			1
" @entity4 should be made into a shrine for the people who died there , " said @entity139 , a retired city detective who worked at ground zero			0
" it breaks my heart for the families who have to put up with this			0
i understand they 're [ building ] it in a respectful way , but it just should n't be down there			1
" others such as @entity152 said the site 's location will be a painful reminder			1
" ( the 9/11 terrorists ) did this in the name of @entity24 , " @entity152 said			0
" it 's a sacred ground where these people died , where my brother was murdered , and to be in the shadows of that religion , it 's just hypocritical and sacrilegious			0
" but @entity165 , who was a paramedic at ground zero , said it was " the right thing to do			0
" " i lost 16 friends down there			0
but @entity85 also got killed on 9/11			0
it would be a good sign of faith that we 're not condemning all @entity85 and that the @entity85 who did this happened to be extremists , " he said			1
" as a black man , i know what it 's like to be discriminated against when you have n't done anything			0
" @entity1 's @entity183 , @entity184 and @entity185 contributed to this report .			0
