longtime @entity1 rep. @entity0 , a @entity2 , says he is " ok " with the ruling not to indict the white police officer whose july chokehold during an arrest killed @entity7 , an unarmed black man , because " it 's not going to stand			1
" " it 's such a ridiculous scenario that i 'm ok with it -- because it 's not going to stand , " @entity0 said on @entity14 's " the lead with @entity13			1
" earlier thursday , the court released details about the evidence given to the grand jury , including the number of witnesses and pieces of evidence involved in the case			0
but @entity0 says the court has made a " terrible mistake " by not explaining exactly how the grand jury reached their verdict			1
" releasing this is releasing absolutely nothing , " @entity0 said			1
" we want to find out just one thing : a group of people were there , one of them got killed , and the rest of them were police			0
" the medical examiner affirmed it was a homicide , @entity0 added			2
" now , setting aside suicide , something happened in that room to convince the people that were there that nothing happened , " he said			0
" and we just want to find out : how could they have possibly reached that conclusion ? " @entity0 , a former @entity1 prosecutor , also said it was a " stupid mistake " that the other police officers involved in the incident were granted immunity because not enough details about their involvement in @entity7 's death have been explained			1
" immunity is given in order to gain the cooperation of witnesses in order to further the indictment that brings the case to court , " @entity0 said			2
" here police officers should n't need immunity to tell the truth			0
if you insist on immunity , it means you think you should be indicted for a crime			0
" @entity0 said he hopes the pending federal investigation illuminates what went on during the grand jury proceedings			2
on wednesday , the president said he and outgoing attorney general @entity84 are " not going to let up " in the effort to solve the problem of racial tensions that exists between law enforcement officers and minorities in communities nationwide .			0
