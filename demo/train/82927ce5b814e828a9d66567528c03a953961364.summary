@entity0 -- they 've been romanticized in movies and songs , but many people really do send messages in a bottle			1
@entity8 has found 64 of them , accumulating what he believes to be one of the world 's largest collections			1
the 2013 @entity14 stumbled onto them while cleaning up the country 's rivers			1
since 1997 , he and volunteers of his nonprofit , @entity20 , have removed more than 7 million pounds of debris from @entity23 waterways			1
@entity1 sat down with @entity24 to find out more about his unusual collection and what 's inside each bottle			1
@entity1 : how did you come to start this collection ? @entity8 : well , i found my first one in 1997 , the year i started			1
there was a large flood on the @entity35 in 1993 , and some guys put a message in a bottle and they threw it in the river and i found it			1
it had a flag on it			2
and i just thought it was kind of cool , so i kept it			2
... the second year , i found two or three more , and then i started to actually look for them			1
i try to keep as many as i can			2
... it 's pretty cool to find them because ( for the most part ) you never know how far they came , where they came from , who they came from			1
@entity1 : how do you find them ? @entity24 : in my work , i see thousands of plastic bottles out there			1
but i 'm always scanning , looking in every bottle for a piece of paper			2
you get psyched out a lot because people have stuffed napkins or wrappers in there			1
you get kind of excited and then , " oh no. " it 's the ultimate thing to find out there			1
when you 're working , you do n't use that time to open it right then			1
you put it in ( the ) boat , think about it and then open it up and read it			1
there 's usually a lot of anticipation for it , especially at a big cleanup			1
it 's a romantic idea			1
and truthfully , most of them are n't like a treasure map			0
usually they 're more intimate			0
... they 're sort of writing to the universe or the one above , just putting their thoughts out there			0
@entity1 : what types of messages have you found ? @entity24 : oh , so many things			1
some of them come hundreds of miles down the river or different rivers			0
... some of them have been found three or four times and passed on , and it 'll keep going down the river and down the river			1
people will sign them and date them			1
i 've found lottery tickets , parking tickets , dollar bills			1
we did find a treasure map , but there was no treasure , i checked			0
i found one from some guys going to the @entity114 when it was in @entity116 ; that was like 10 years old			1
i found one from a girl who threw it in a stream in @entity121 , @entity116 , and it made it to the @entity124 and then a couple hundred miles into the @entity35			1
i found one for voodoo			1
it said , " you are bound now , " and it had a string that pulled the paper tight			0
... the newest guy on our board , he was at a cleanup for about 10 minutes and he finds this message in a bottle			0
it had wax at the top so it would n't leak and all kinds of sparkles and stuff inside			0
i thought , " this is going to be a good one			0
" we could n't see inside the bottle			0
i got a knife and opened it			0
this stuff started blowing all over him			0
it turned out it was the ashes of somebody			2
it was like the movie " @entity155			0
" but it was cool			0
there was a note about the guy who passed away , and it also had another note that said : " if anyone finds this , you are so blessed			0
" it was kind of neat that they decided to write a note to someone who might find it someday			0
@entity1 : have you ever gotten in touch with anyone who has sent a message ? @entity24 : actually , there are fun ones who say , " if you find this , call me			1
" i 've called probably three to five of them over the years			2
half of them forget they ever did it			0
the one that i most remember was a truck driver			0
he was smart , because he put some rocks in the bottle , which weighs it down , which means the current will carry it versus the wind			0
anyway , his message gave his name and phone number , so i called him and said , " hey , you threw a message in a bottle			0
" and he said , " i do n't know what you 're talking about			0
" and i said : " @entity200 , this is you			0
you must 've thrown it off -- my guess is somewhere near @entity204 , @entity205 -- and i found it about 90 miles downriver			2
" and he said : " @entity208 , i 'm pulling over			0
i did that five or six years ago ! " he got superexcited			2
do you know a hero ? nominations are open for 2013 @entity14 @entity1 : do you think it 's the world 's largest collection of its kind ? @entity24 : it 's the second - largest			1
i used to think it was the largest , but i just found out maybe a month ago that this dude down in @entity219 has 150 of them			2
he 's a professor , and he has been documenting garbage on the ocean since 1978 -- not picking it up , just documenting it			2
so his collection is bigger			0
... but we have found way more than 64 actually			1
if volunteers find them and want to keep them , i let them , so we 've probably found about 50 more			2
i just do n't have them			0
@entity1 : do you have a favorite message ? @entity24 : i do			1
it 's a song that was written for guitar called " @entity233 is you			2
" it was thrown into the @entity235 and then went into the @entity236			0
it 's a love song			2
there 's actually a lot of them that are pretty heavy , you know ? they 're not treasure maps , but they were written to a lost loved one			2
... you do n't want to keep it , because it was meant not to be kept			0
so you just kind of send those on , even though it feels weird letting a bottle go on .			0
