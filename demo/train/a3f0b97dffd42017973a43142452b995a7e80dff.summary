-- nothing gets people in the @entity4 spirit like group costumes			1
teamwork was the finishing touch of many @entity9 ' outfits -- whether it was a team of green army men or crayons			2
many @entity9 devoted a lot of time and effort into perfecting their costumes , such as @entity17 and his partner @entity18 , who went to creative lengths to create their nun - chuck couples costume : " we did some searching online and came across a website that sold chain links in every size and color one could imagine			1
" they chose a hollow chain , cut it , tied each end of the chain to thin , plastic hair bands and finished it off with metallic - looking headbands			0
they chose to do a couples costume after @entity18 proposed to @entity17 on a business trip in @entity36 a few weeks before @entity4 last year			2
@entity37 received an array of costume submissions -- @entity9 slipped on masks and assumed the roles of superheroes , dressed in their best ( or worst ) as celebrities , and put the pop in pop culture icons with their creative and eye - catching outfits			1
the costume themes varied as widely as the amount of time invested in creating them -- one @entity52 says she spent up to a month creating most of the 17 costumes for a " @entity56 " group , while others chose simpler themes and created their costumes in one night , such as a @entity61 college student group displayed in the gallery above			2
however different the costumes were , two themes emerged among all of the @entity66 : the fun of the creation process as a group and the reactions at the end result			0
@entity72 and her movie accountant co-workers dressed up as the @entity75 and purportedly elicited quite a reaction from a celebrity on the set : " at the end of the week we pay our employees and actors their per diem			0
@entity82 was on this list , among others			0
you can imagine her response to a biker with fake chest hair and an @entity89 handling her money			0
" we featured some of the best submissions in the above gallery , but be sure to check out all of the great group @entity4 costume submissions here .			1
