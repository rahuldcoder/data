@entity0 -- targeted political advertising is heading to a new but very familiar frontier -- @entity4			1
if you live in @entity6 or @entity7 , @entity8 , and go to the popular video sharing site in the next two weeks to find a news clip or view a favorite home decorating show , the first thing that will pop up on your screen will be a political ad			1
for the first time a political campaign is targeting voters by zip code on @entity4			1
the @entity20 @entity19 added this new advertising tool to the broadcast media strategy it recently launched focused on a number of @entity25 and @entity26 races , one of the earliest and biggest efforts the pro-business lobby has unveiled to date			1
in seven @entity8 congressional districts where the @entity19 is running paid television ads , it added a new layer -- running those tv ads on @entity4			1
" the stakes of this election are huge for the business community and we recognize as we roll out our different phases of the campaigns , we 're going to use broadcast but we 're also going to use @entity4 , " said @entity34 , senior political strategist for the @entity20 @entity19			1
" we 're going to use the @entity42 to reinforce and repeat and repeat and repeat the messages of how important it is to have a growing economy and candidates that are pro-growth			0
" anyone who visits @entity4 in the next two weeks -- and whose ip address or computer location falls within any of the zip codes of the specific @entity8 districts -- will see the @entity19 's ad before seeing a video clip			1
the program , called " @entity55 " allows the user five seconds to " opt out , " or stop playing the political ad			0
and the @entity19 only pays for the ads that people watch			1
corporate advertisers have been using so - called " pre-roll ads " on websites to sell toothpaste or preview a movie coming to theaters soon			0
but the technology to target ads to specific zip codes was just released in march by @entity69 , which owns @entity4 , according to @entity70 , who leads @entity69 's advertising sales to political campaigns and issue advocacy groups			1
the @entity75 campaign pioneered targeting voters online and on mobile devices in 2008 , and both parties now feature online outreach components to get out their messages			1
but this effort is the first instance of a campaign turning to @entity4 to aim its political pitch at specific zip codes			1
@entity34 calls combining the online ads with tv a " one - two punch			0
" the effort includes a variety of ads , which the @entity19 is using to gauge how voters respond to different messages online			1
three positive ads promote the pro-business credentials of @entity95 freshman reps			0
@entity96 , @entity97 , and @entity98			0
three negative ads , which the @entity19 calls " contrast " ads , criticize @entity103 reps			1
@entity104 , @entity105 and @entity106 for supporting " @entity107 " and argue they oppose pro-growth policies			0
one ad combines criticism of @entity103 incumbent rep. @entity111 with a plug for his @entity95 challenger @entity113			0
a @entity115 study commissioned by @entity69 last year found that viewers who see advertising across multiple platforms are more likely to retain the message			2
the @entity19 's strategy demonstrates it believes the same successful experience businesses found with online ads could translate into the political arena			1
@entity124 , who is challenging @entity96 to retake the central @entity8 seat she knocked him out of in 2010 , is n't convinced that this kind of micro-targeting will make a big difference in the fall election			2
" it does n't surprise me that big money is going to come in on my opponent @entity131 's side because she supports these big business things that are good for them , but it 's not at all connecting to our local chamber of commerce , " @entity124 told @entity1			0
@entity124 said his local @entity6 chamber did n't contribute to the ad or sign off on the effort and said the national business lobby 's message does n't mesh with local concerns			0
" it 's almost like it 's just coming in from above with a message that 's generic in an attempt to prop her up in a district where she does n't have that kind of support , even from small businesses , " he said			0
the @entity19 's television campaign is a multimillion - dollar effort , but @entity34 declined to say how much specifically the chamber is spending on the @entity4 component			1
one expert familiar with online advertising says the average cost of a pre-roll ad is roughly 10 to 15 cents per view			0
over the course of two weeks , potentially thousands of users could view each of the ads in the seven districts			2
@entity70 stressed that the data collected on the ads does not contain any personally identifiable information , but @entity69 can pull together some aggregate data on age and gender and interest categories based on who watches the ads on @entity4			1
@entity34 calls the data it will get from the @entity4 after the two - week run " survey research			1
" " we 're able to go in and look at how long people are on the ads , if they like the ads and stay until the end of the ad , if they stay on more for a positive ad or a contrast ad , " @entity34 said , adding , " this is another tool to help us decide if our ads are penetrating and working and getting to the voters			2
" it 's no surprise that @entity4 is the place to start this type of targeted political outreach			2
more than 2 billion videos are streamed each day on its website and approximately 100 million unique users in the @entity20 click on the site every month , according to @entity4 's own statistics			1
earlier this year , the @entity200 paid to run an ad on @entity4 hitting the @entity25 @entity95 's budget proposal and featuring actor @entity203			2
it targeted users who typed any search for " @entity207			0
" but the @entity19 's move to focus resources to reach voters in specific congressional districts could prove to be a more effective use of money			1
television ads are pricey and candidates are often forced to buy time in markets that broadcast outside their particular district 's borders			2
with people increasingly turning to mobile devices to get news or view entertainment programming on their own schedules , fewer people are watching television programs when they actually air			0
a study in @entity228 last fall conducted by @entity229 , a group working with @entity95 pollsters , found that 40 % of likely voters were " going off the grid " and had not watched live television within the previous week			0
the @entity19 's move is a reflection of the changing environment that can make getting political messages out a greater challenge			2
" we know in today 's fractured media world , people get their messages from many different places , and the @entity42 is becoming the top place , " @entity34 noted			0
" technology is very important to reaching voters , and clearly the @entity75 campaign showed that and we ( @entity103 ) used @entity247 and @entity248 and all that to get our message out , " @entity124 said			2
but the @entity103 candidate said he believes @entity96 's constituents will focus on the @entity95 congresswoman 's record this fall more than the message in the 30 - second online ad			0
" you have to talk to voters , " @entity124 said			0
" you ca n't just spoon - feed them			0
" @entity259 @entity258 contributed to this report .			0

@entity20 @entity19 is running the ads in seven @entity8 state districts
the technology to target ads to specific zip codes was just released in march by @entity69
