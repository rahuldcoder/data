@entity0 -- the @entity2 agreed on a path forward in @entity4 on sunday that instructs president @entity5 to delegate powers to his vice president following the formation of a national unity government			1
the @entity4 government roundly rejected the plan , which it views as " blatant intervention in its internal affairs , " @entity4 's official @entity11 news agency reported soon after the announcement			1
the @entity2 called for the government to start a dialogue with the opposition within two weeks and for the new government to be formed within two months			1
the unity government should within three months prepare to elect a council that will write a constitution , the @entity2 said			1
it should also prepare for parliamentary and presidential elections			2
the plan , details of which were announced by @entity30 foreign minister @entity29 at a press conference in @entity0 , is the clearest statement yet from the @entity2 on what the league 's member states would like to see happen in @entity4			1
it remains unclear what weight , if any , the proposal will carry on the ground			0
" the president will delegate his first vice president the full power to work with the national unity government to enable it to perform its task in the transitional period , " the foreign minister said			1
the @entity2 will take its initiative , which does not back military intervention in @entity4 , to the @entity50 in a bid to build international support			1
the organization also said it would extend its monitoring mission in @entity4 and increase the number of observers there			2
the mission was scheduled to end last thursday			0
it was not clear whether @entity4 officials would accept the offer			2
secretary - general @entity61 said the @entity4 government has not complied with some parts of an @entity2 agreement aimed at ending a violent crackdown on protesters			1
@entity4 officials are treating the crisis as a security problem , he said , noting that armed opposition factions controlling some areas made it difficult for observers to do their jobs			2
but @entity2 monitors have seen some aspects of the situation improve , he said			0
" the presence of the @entity79 monitors provided security to opposition parties , which held an increase in number of peaceful protests ... in the areas where the monitors were present , " @entity61 said			0
before @entity61 's statement , @entity88 's foreign minister said his nation planned to withdraw its members of the observer team , according to an @entity2 official			0
prince @entity94 told @entity2 foreign ministers that " @entity4 did not comply with the @entity79 resolution plan , " according to the @entity2 official , who asked to remain anonymous because he was not authorized to speak to the media			1
earlier sunday , a five - nation committee led by @entity30 requested a one - month extension of the mission from the foreign ministers of the league 's 22 member states			0
the committee made its request after reviewing a report submitted by @entity107 lt. gen. @entity106 , head of the league 's monitoring mission in @entity4			0
before leaving @entity110 for the meeting in @entity0 , @entity106 said the mission of the monitoring group is " not to stop the killing and violence in @entity4 but to investigate the @entity4 government 's execution of the article of the @entity79 plan aimed at solving the @entity4 crisis			1
" the @entity2 has called on president @entity5 's regime to stop violence against civilians , free political detainees , remove tanks and weapons from cities and allow outsiders , including the international news media , to travel freely in @entity4			1
senior @entity2 diplomats said the @entity4 government has not accepted or rejected the possibility of a one - month extension			1
some worry the observers have n't been allowed to see the full situation in @entity4			0
" the @entity79 monitors indicated that the regime did not follow protocol , did not release the detainees , did not remove all military tanks , did not allow press to travel freely , did not recognize even once the peaceful protests , and the massacre of @entity145 yesterday is proof of that			0
the regime let down the @entity2 , and @entity79 nations have the responsibility to respond , " said @entity148 , head of the opposition @entity149			1
he spoke to reporters in @entity0 following the @entity2 announcement , calling for the protection of civilians in @entity4 , describing @entity50 cooperation as vital and stressing the need for @entity158 to resign			1
" any serious entrance of an interim period must start with @entity5 announcing his stepping down , " he said			0
the presence of @entity2 monitors in the country has n't quelled daily reports of deadly violence			2
at least 59 people were found dead across @entity4 on saturday , according to the @entity166 , an opposition activist group			2
they include 30 unidentified corpses found at the @entity168 in @entity145 and at least 16 dead from a bus explosion in northwestern @entity4 's @entity145 province			0
@entity1 can not confirm the claims by opposition groups of violence and deaths , as @entity4 's government has limited access by foreign journalists			2
for more than 10 months , @entity4 has been engulfed by an anti-government public uprising and a brutal security crackdown against protesters			0
the @entity50 last month estimated well over 5,000 deaths since mid-march			0
opposition groups estimate more than 6,000 people have died			0
while activists blame the violence on @entity5 's regime , the government says terrorists have been responsible for the bloodshed			2
@entity1 's @entity190 , @entity191 and @entity192 contributed to this report .			0
