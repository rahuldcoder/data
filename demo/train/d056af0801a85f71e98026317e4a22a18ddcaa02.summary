a @entity1 apartment where the first person diagnosed with @entity3 in the @entity4 had stayed is finally getting a thorough cleaning , days after the diagnosis left four people quarantined there with soiled towels and sweat - stained sheets from the @entity3 patient			1
after some delays , the first of three phases to clean the apartment began friday afternoon			0
while the process will take days , at least sheets and towels that @entity3 patient @entity17 used have been removed			1
also out are the four people -- the partner of the @entity3 patient @entity17 , her 13 - year - old son and her two 20 - something nephews -- who 'd been stuck there for days			1
they had been ordered to stay inside the apartment until october 19			0
by that point , enough time should have passed to determine if any of them contracted @entity3 or if they 're in the clear			1
judge @entity27 , director of the county 's @entity28 and @entity30 , said friday that @entity17 's partner slept last night on a couch pillow on the living room floor			1
but now she and the others have a new place to call home in the meantime : a private 4 - bedroom residence in @entity1 , which was arranged with the help of someone in the local faith - based community			1
" they were very glad to be going and very pleased when they got there , " @entity27 said			0
" ( one of them ) got a big grin on his face , and he said , ' i wish somebody would get me a basketball			0
' so we 're going to see if we ca n't take care of that			0
" the move added to a busy day for the quartet , who until then had gotten little more than brief stops from a health official and were told not to go more than a few steps outside			1
on friday , they were visited by a hazardous materials team wearing masks , boots and yellow protective gear , as seen in photos tweeted by @entity68 spokeswoman @entity67			0
a large tarp was laid out , and several oil - drum like containers were on site			0
some have criticized the fact that it took so long to start the process , given that health officials announced three days ago that @entity17 had @entity3			1
at that time , four people @entity17 had stayed with in the @entity79 city were ordered not to leave the apartment because of possible lingering effects of @entity17 , from his clothes to toilets to silverware			1
additionally , the @entity1 hospital where @entity17 is being treated has come under fire for how it handled his first visit there eight days ago			1
@entity17 's partner , identified only as @entity90 , told @entity92 's @entity91 that hospital medical staff were twice told that @entity17 , who was suffering with fever and abdominal pain , had recently arrived from @entity96 -- key information that could have been a tipoff for @entity3 , yet was never properly relayed			1
instead , he was released with an antibiotic only to come back by ambulance even sicker on sunday			0
dr. @entity100 , the director of the @entity101 , acknowledged to reporters friday that " there were missteps " in @entity1 as to how @entity17 's case was initially treated			1
but he also insisted that " there were a lot of things that went right and are going right			0
" and @entity100 stressed that , while there may be a case here and there , what 's happened with @entity3 in @entity96 -- where more than 3,400 people have died and public health infrastructures have become overwhelmed -- wo n't happen in the @entity4			1
" our health care infrastructure in the @entity4 is well - equipped to stop @entity3 in its tracks , " @entity100 said			1
official : 50 being monitored until this week , @entity3 's impact on the @entity4 has been confined to preemptive measures at airports and elsewhere to stop its spread , the deployment of @entity4 military and other resources to @entity96 to help corral the outbreak there , and the treatment of a select few @entity4 who contacted the virus in @entity96 and were flown back home to get well			1
but @entity17 changed all that			2
he landed in @entity1 on september 20 , started feeling sick days later , then made his initial visit to @entity133 late on september 25			0
he went back three days later and was quickly isolated , with a blood test confirmed he had @entity3 on tuesday			2
if he gets healthy , @entity17 could be in trouble : some in @entity136 have accused him of lying on a pre-flight questionnaire about his contact with @entity3 sufferers , leading to threats of charges by authorities there and prompting the @entity146 district attorney 's office to announce it is " looking into whether or not ( he ) knowingly and intentionally exposed the public to a deadly virus -- making this a criminal matter			1
" for now , though , any future legal battles are overshadowed by @entity17 's fight for his life -- in isolation , in serious condition , at @entity133			1
no one he 'd come in contact with has shown symptoms of @entity3 , though officials were watching them -- 50 people in all -- just in case			2
these 50 are people @entity17 came in contact with while he was contagious			2
monitoring means a public health worker visits the contacts twice a day to take temperatures and to ask if they are experiencing any symptoms			0
dr. @entity168 of the @entity169 said officials are casting a wide net			0
" we have a low level of concern about the vast majority of these people that we 're following , " she said			0
that sentiment was echoed friday night by @entity1 mayor @entity179 , who pointed out " there is only one person " -- @entity17 , who is in isolated in a hospital -- " that is actively showing " signs of @entity3			1
only those showing symptoms of @entity3 are contagious			2
" we 're a little anxious , but there is no fear in our eyes , " @entity187 said of local residents			0
" we will be safe , and we will get this done in the appropriate way			0
" ebola in spotlight elsewhere in @entity4 @entity17 is n't the only person being talked about in the @entity4 with real or possible @entity3			1
@entity199 in @entity200 has admitted a low - risk patient with symptoms " that could be associated with @entity3 , " hospital spokeswoman @entity198 - @entity197 said friday			1
the patient , who was not named , recently traveled to @entity204 and presented with the symptoms upon his or her return , she said			0
the patient is in stable condition			0
" in an abundance of caution , we have activated the appropriate infection control protocols , including isolating the patient , " @entity209 said			0
" our medical team continues to evaluate and monitor progress in close collaboration with the @entity169 and the @entity218			0
" officials in @entity220 also said they isolated a man with flu - like symptoms who 'd recently been in @entity96 shortly after his arrest early friday for suspected drunken driving			0
but " so far all of his labwork is negative " and " we have no reason to believe that he has @entity3 , " @entity226 of @entity228 commissioner dr. @entity227 said			2
but there is one @entity4 confirmed with the virus : @entity236 , a freelance cameraman for @entity237 who was diagnosed in @entity238 on thursday dr. @entity239 said his son , @entity236 , remembers getting some fluid in his face while helping to disinfect a chair inside a clinic where he was filming			2
@entity236 , 33 , a freelance cameraman for @entity237 , started feeling achy and tired wednesday , and he quarantined himself			0
a day later , a test at a @entity247 facility in @entity238 confirmed that he had @entity3			2
@entity237 has said the entire team will return to the @entity4 soon aboard a private charter plane			2
@entity239 said that his son will be heading to @entity251 , which is the same facility where dr. @entity253 was recently treated			0
official : @entity4 focusing on ' source countries ' as intense as the media attention is in the @entity4 , the issues here are nothing compared to @entity96 , where @entity3 continues to spread through the living and the dead and where health facilities have often been unable to keep up with the outbreak			1
the @entity4 government has been involved in trying to help countries like @entity136 , with more help possibly on its way			2
@entity268 spokesman rear adm. @entity267 said friday that the @entity4 military could send as many as 4,000 troops to the @entity3 - afflicted countries			1
about 200 @entity4 troops are there now , and @entity200 had previously committed to sending 3,000 troops			2
the @entity4 troops will not treat patients , but will help establish health facilities and medical treatment units " so that the health care workers can do their jobs , " @entity267 said			0
paying attention to @entity96 , whether it 's getting @entity3 patients well there or doing things to prevent infected people from leaving the country , is a national security priority for the @entity4 , said @entity287 , president @entity289 's homeland security and counterterrorism adviser			1
@entity287 said friday : " we are taking steps to address the source , the people coming from the source counties and we think those are the most effective steps we can take			0

@entity299 's office : a " criminal matter " if @entity17 " knowingly *...* exposed " public to @entity3
crews have begun cleaning the apartment where @entity17 stayed
county official : 4 quarantined were " very pleased " to move into 4 - bedroom home
@entity4 official : " the @entity4 is well - equipped to stop @entity3 in its tracks "
