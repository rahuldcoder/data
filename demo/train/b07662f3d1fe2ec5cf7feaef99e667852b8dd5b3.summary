@entity2 president @entity0 will unveil his long - awaited immigration plan thursday evening , changing rules governing deportations that could affect millions of undocumented immigrants and setting off an explosive battle with @entity8			1
@entity0 's prime - time address will be followed friday by an event in @entity12 , sources tell @entity1			1
while exact details of his announcement are n't yet public , the basic outline of the plan , as relayed by people familiar with its planning , includes deferring deportation for the parents of @entity24 citizens , a move that would affect up to 3.5 million people			2
" everybody agrees that our immigration system is broken			0
unfortunately , @entity2 has allowed the problem to fester for far too long , " @entity0 said in a video posted on his @entity32 page wednesday			2
" and so what i 'm going to be laying out is the things that i can do with my lawful authority as president to make the system work better , even as i continue to work with @entity39 to encourage them to get a bipartisan , comprehensive bill that can solve the entire problem			2
" @entity0 invited congressional @entity45 leaders to the @entity46 for a dinner wednesday night to discuss his plans for an executive order , a source told @entity1			1
@entity50 : 5 questions you should be asking about @entity0 and immigration the president declared in june he would n't wait for @entity39 to pass a comprehensive overhaul of the immigration system , initially saying he would announce changes by the end the summer			1
the decision was delayed until after the midterm elections , when the @entity46 believed it would n't be caught up in campaign politics			2
but @entity8 are expressing deep anger at the anticipated move , saying unilateral action on immigration would forestall any legislative action			1
two @entity8 who would play a key role in crafting immigration legislation made a fresh call for @entity0 to hold off on his plans wednesday -- and warned that if he goes ahead , they 'll try to stop the @entity46 from implementing his executive order			1
" instead of proceeding with ill - advised executive action , we implore you to work with @entity39 to enact legislation to address our broken immigration system , " @entity78 chairman @entity77 ( @entity79 ) and @entity81 chairman @entity80 ( @entity76			2
) said in a letter to @entity0			2
related : ' @entity84 ' actress pushes @entity0 for immigration overhaul " we strongly urge you to respect the @entity86 and abandon any unconstitutional , unilateral executive actions on immigration			1
let 's secure the border , enforce our immigration laws in the interior of the @entity24 , and build a broad consensus for immigration reform , " they wrote			2
" otherwise , as the chairmen of the committees with oversight over border security and our nation 's immigration laws , we will be forced to use the tools afforded to @entity39 by the @entity86 to stop your administration from successfully carrying out your plan			2
" @entity46 press secretary @entity105 chided the @entity106 during his briefing wednesday , saying concerns about how @entity0 's immigration move could affect the government funding debate and presidential nominations in the weeks ahead are " predicated on at least the premise that @entity8 have been exceedingly cooperative with the president			1
" senate majority leader @entity114 -- the @entity116 @entity115 who will lose his post once @entity8 take control of the chamber in january -- lauded @entity0 's move , saying the @entity106 forced his hand			1
" @entity123 immigration reform brings relief to families being torn apart by our broken system , " he said			0
" @entity123 immigration reform is an economic issue and one we must address			0
that 's why i have been so disappointed that @entity8 have ducked , dodged and skirted taking up legislation this @entity39 forcing president @entity0 to act administratively			1
" the contours of @entity0 's announcement have been the subject of speculation among immigration activists for months , though the @entity46 has yet to officially relay what @entity0 will announce when he speaks to the @entity24 people on thursday night			1
administration officials say a key part of the announcement will be allowing the parents of @entity24 citizens , who are undocumented immigrants themselves , to remain in the @entity24 without the threat of deportation			0
that would include the parents of legal residents , but not the parents of children eligible for delayed deportation under a rule @entity0 enacted in 2012			0
up to 3.6 million people would be affected by that change , according to an estimate from the @entity155 , though the figures are smaller if @entity0 's announcement includes a minimum number of years spent in the country			1
mandating parents live in the @entity24 for at least 5 years before becoming eligible would bring the number affected to 3.3 million ; a 10 - year minimum would bring it down further to an estimated 2.5 million people			0
other potential areas of reform include extending the deportation deferment for immigrants who were brought to the @entity24 as children			0
altering the age restrictions on that action could allow hundreds of thousands more people to remain in the @entity24			0
officials also said the plan could include a stronger focus on deporting criminals who are undocumented immigrants and an expansion of worker visas in areas like technology			0
lastly , the plan could include new resources to bolster security on the border			0
homeland security secretary @entity184 said the " reforms will be comprehensive , " and that border security measures will be included			0
@entity0 's position on immigration could be a popular one			1
despite an overall wave of support for @entity106 candidates , 57 % of this year 's midterm election voters believe undocumented immigrants should have a chance to apply for legal status , while just 39 % want them deported to the country they came from , @entity1 's exit polls found			0
those exit polls found that 71 % of @entity24 midterm voters believe undocumented immigrants should be allowed to stay in the country legally if they meet certain requirements -- while 25 % said those immigrants should n't be allowed to stay			0
a september @entity205 / @entity204 poll found 51 % saying @entity0 should use his executive powers to address immigration if @entity39 fails to act while 43 % said he should not			1
a similar @entity210 / @entity209 survey earlier that month found 52 % support for @entity0 acting on his own			0
@entity212 and @entity213 contributed to this report .			0
