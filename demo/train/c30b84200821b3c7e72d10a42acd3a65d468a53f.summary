-- @entity1 , adopted from @entity2 at the age of six months in 1972 , never felt she belonged growing up in a rural @entity5 town			1
but decades later the 40 - year - old discovered her adoption began with a lie			2
while trying to apply for a visa in 2006 , @entity1 was told her legal birthday did n't match birth papers supplied by her orphanage			0
after an investigation , @entity1 unraveled the mystery : an adoption agency in @entity2 had given her a fake identity to make her more attractive for adoption , she said			1
" i could see where they lied to get me adopted , " said @entity1			0
her family history and physical description was rewritten to hide the fact that she was in poor health , having been abused by her father			0
and the agency had lied to @entity1 's @entity2 mother , saying she would be sent to a pair of wealthy @entity28 lawyers			1
@entity2 was a pioneer on international adoptions			1
in the aftermath of @entity33 and @entity34 , more than 200,000 children were sent to live with families abroad , according to the @entity2 @entity36			1
as recently as 2005 , @entity2 was the fourth largest provider of children to @entity40 families , sending more than 1,600 orphans that year , according to the @entity42			1
but @entity1 , who repatriated to @entity2 in 2008 , is part of a vanguard of @entity40 adoptees who have led the fight to stop overseas adoptions from @entity2 and change the cultural stigma tied to unwed mothers			1
" the best option is always for a child to be parented by his or her birth parent , " she said			0
" then domestic adoption , and only then intercountry adoption			0
" " if you take a look at what 's going on in ( @entity2 ) adoption reform , all of it is led by adoptees , " said @entity56 , a 36 - year old @entity2 adoptee in @entity5 and publisher of @entity59 , an online magazine on adoption issues			1
" we 've been disenfranchised for so long , and we 're finally writing our own history , for the first time , on our own terms			0
" in 2012 , the @entity72 implemented the @entity73 , crafted by @entity1 with a coalition of adoptee activists and allies			0
the law explicitly discourages sending children abroad			1
under the law , birth mothers must nurse babies for seven days before the child can be considered for adoption			2
if a mother chooses adoption , her consent must be verified and her child 's birth registered			0
finally , a mother may choose to revoke the adoption up to six months after her application			0
" it 's a paradigm shift , " @entity1 said			0
" we 're checking to make sure things are done ethically and properly			0
in my generation , people did things with blindly , deadly , and unethical speed			0
" even before the new law took effect , the number of children being adopted abroad from @entity2 has been in decline			1
only 621 @entity2 children were adopted by @entity40 families in 2012 , compared to nearly 1,800 in 2002 , according to the @entity42			1
' ungrateful ' not all adoptees are cheering the reform			2
@entity106 , 57 , is a defender of intercountry adoption and the founder of the @entity109 in @entity2 ( @entity110 )			1
" @entity111 came down to adopt human beings as his own children , even when we did not deserve it , " he said			0
" i believe it is our human duty , that if we have more than people from other nations -- then we should share			2
" born in the aftermath of the @entity34 and orphaned at age 5 , @entity106 spent his early childhood wandering streets and sleeping under bridges , he said			1
after moving to an orphanage , he was finally adopted at age 14 to a @entity127 family in @entity128			0
" they did n't have to adopt me , but they did , " he said			0
" i really , really love them for what they did			0
" he opposes the new @entity2 law 's requirement for mothers to register their children 's birth before adoption , arguing that it counters cultural norms			1
" in @entity2 culture , face - saving is very important , " he said			1
" mothers are afraid the birth record will later show up , and that husbands will not marry them later			2
if you force birth mothers to register for adoption , they 're just going to abandon their children			2
" @entity2 adoption activist @entity151 , 40 , disagrees			1
@entity106 's criticism is based on " incorrect information , " said @entity151 , who was adopted as an infant in 1973 and returned to live permanently in @entity2 in 1995			1
" after a child is placed in a family , that child will be removed from the birth mother 's registry			0
" @entity151 rejects the idea that the law is not suitable for @entity2 culture			1
" there 's the idea that @entity2 culture , as large as it is , and as vast as it is , is somehow static			1
i 've lived in the country since 1995 , and there 's been tremendous cultural change			0
" fight for single - mother rights @entity2 returnee activists are now fighting to improve government support for single women who have children			1
" mothers are mothers , " she said			2
" if you give them a real chance , most will want to parent their children			0
who is the parent should not be a contest of who has the most stuff			0
" @entity151 believes @entity2 's adoption reform movement will set an example for other countries			1
" we 're the first generation of international adoptees that are telling our own stories , " she said			2
" a lot of the adoptees leaving @entity200 , for example , are going to look at our model to see what 's important			2
" but @entity203 said she 's not ready to celebrate			0
single mother welfare remains lacking and adoption agencies as well as groups like @entity207 's @entity110 are fighting to overturn the @entity73			2
" the @entity210 have a saying , after a mountain , there 's another mountain , " she said with a sigh .			0
