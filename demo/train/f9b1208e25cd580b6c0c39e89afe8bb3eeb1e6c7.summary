-- forty days alone in the wilderness was enough for @entity2 , but @entity3 is facing an altogether longer period of solitude			1
the disgraced former cycling icon was stripped of his seven @entity8 titles 44 days ago , on october 22 , and has spent most of the intervening period in his hometown of @entity11 , @entity12			1
while he contemplates his next move , there have been beneficiaries of his newfound infamy , notably @entity3 's bike store			1
call it the power of celebrity or call it voyeurism , but thanks to @entity3 's notoriety , the @entity11 store co-owned by the disgraced cyclist , with its name inspired by the @entity12 's nickname on the @entity8 -- @entity3 's , an americanized version of the @entity29 for the leader 's yellow jersey , maillot jaune -- is doing just fine			1
giant photographs of @entity3 crossing the line , arms aloft , loom over racks of bikes ; a set of framed , signed yellow jerseys fills another wall ; @entity3 merchandise is on offer at every turn , from cycling spandex to lemon - flavored waffles			1
" it would be @entity3 's decision , " general manager @entity46 explained when asked why the memorabilia remains on display , given @entity3 's spectacular fall from grace			1
" if he decides he wants us to take them down , we would , but until that happens , they will stay up			0
" how an all - american hero fell to earth and by the look of the shop 's bustle on a monday morning , @entity3 's will survive the scandal that has enveloped @entity3			1
" we have n't seen it in terms of the number of customers coming in , " @entity46 said			0
" it really has n't had an effect in a negative way			0
" it is not just cycling enthusiasts that are flocking to the shop ; the stars of @entity73 also stopped off during the sport 's first visit to @entity11 last month			1
@entity77 driver @entity76 took a look inside @entity3 's while seven - time world champion @entity80 and @entity81 of @entity82 both purchased bikes			1
@entity3 's epic downfall written out of history since the release of the @entity90 's report that stated there was " overwhelming " evidence @entity3 was involved in " the most sophisticated , professionalized and successful doping program " ever seen in professional cycling , the @entity86 's reputation has unraveled like a onion being peeled away one layer at a time			1
@entity3 steadfastly maintains his innocence			2
but a few blocks east of @entity3 's is the yellow - hued headquarters of the @entity100 -- the charity @entity3 set up after overcoming testicular cancer that had spread to his lungs , abdomen and brain -- which has taken down his @entity8 race - winner 's yellow jerseys			1
but if the @entity86 has been written out of cycling history -- " @entity3 has no place in cycling , " said the @entity112 's president , @entity111 , recently -- the cyclist 's legacy at home in @entity11 remains deep - rooted and complex			1
it was thanks to @entity3 that this laid - back city became synonymous with cycling			1
its biking culture has been strengthened by the presence of close to 50,000 @entity125 students using bikes to commute around town , the city 's provision of cycling infrastructure and the popular biking trails that circle the shoreline of @entity133 on the fringes of downtown			2
few in the city disagree that @entity3 put @entity11 on the cycling map -- and vice versa			1
" the @entity3 effect is part of what gave cycling such a big boost here , " said @entity138 , president of the @entity139			1
" when he started winning the @entity8 , there was lots of buzz			2
people gathered to watch it ; there were parties all round town , not just at bike shops but at bars and grills			0
it was a tremendous boost			0
" the city paid tribute to @entity3 's contribution to cycling with the creation of the @entity160 , running east to west across downtown			1
there have been calls for the bikeway to be renamed , but @entity11 's mayor @entity165 says he has no plans to amend this homage to @entity3			1
so as they whizz past @entity3 's name emblazoned on square , green and white signs , @entity11 's cyclists have a permanent reminder of his deeds -- good and bad			1
" @entity3 is a very divisive topic , " @entity139 explained			2
" there are people who really believe he was persecuted and it 's not fair what 's happening to him			2
@entity3 quits @entity100 entirely " then there are others who feel he is getting exactly what he deserves			2
there 's a reputation of @entity3 as a bit of a jerk and ( the doping ) was part of his win - at - all - costs personality			1
" there is a sizeable part of the community who really do n't care one way or another			0
" we as people want to believe he overcame cancer and he won the most grueling bicycle race in the world , and he did it seven times in a row			0
" but cycling was here before @entity3 got here , and it 'll still be here long after we 've forgotten him			2
" back at the 15 - year - old @entity100 charity , which has raised more than $ 500 million to support cancer patients , donations have increased since the allegations linking @entity3 with serial doping			1
" it might be that people are learning about the work of the foundation as a result of the controversy from the cycling world , " mused @entity100 spokeswoman @entity208			2
" in which case , that is a positive effect			0
" @entity3 stepped down as chairman of the @entity100 in october , the same month the organization also legally changed its name from the @entity100			2
@entity208 says it 's his work with the foundation that should remain as @entity3 's lasting legacy , not the implosion of his cycling career			1
" i would say that @entity3 's greatest legacy is creating an organization that has helped 2.5 million people when they are facing cancer , " she added			1
" he 's still the foundation 's biggest donor			2
he 's donated $ 7 million			0
" amid all the opinion and rhetoric bubbling around @entity3 in @entity11 , there was no sign of the man himself			1
his only public appearance since the scandal enveloped him was at a @entity100 gala on october 20 , and when @entity73 made its debut in the city , @entity3 flew to @entity242 to avoid the hubbub			2
@entity244 , who has followed @entity3 's rise and fall for the @entity247 newspaper since 1996 , is one of the few still in regular contact with @entity3			1
" the last time i talked to him , he seemed to be doing reasonably well , " she said			0
" he has access to a private plane where he can zip off and go hang out in @entity242 at his house there			0
" @entity3 , who also has a @entity256 - style villa close to downtown @entity11 , has no reason to keep out of the public gaze in his hometown , according to @entity260			1
" when he rides , he goes out to the @entity262 , but his house is in central @entity11 , " she explained			2
" he 's got five kids , two of whom live with him			0
he 's very active , going to see all their sporting events , sometimes coaching their soccer teams			0
he sits in line to pick up the kids			0
" he lives pretty normal			0
he goes out to eat			0
i do n't see him keeping a low profile here			0
" he 's not beloved anymore , but he 's not hated			0
" away from @entity11 , the wheels of justice are cranking into gear			2
sponsor sad at loss of @entity3 's ' great story ' an @entity112 commission has been assembled to investigate the @entity90 's damning report into the allegations that @entity3 systematically used performance - enhancing drugs			1
he could also face lawsuits from groups such as @entity285 newspaper @entity284 , which lost legal disputes with @entity3 surrounding doping allegations and , as a result , paid out huge sums , as well as @entity12 insurance firm @entity290 , which insured performance bonuses paid to the @entity86 after he claimed his fourth , fifth and sixth @entity8 wins			1
back in @entity12 , there is a little expectation of @entity3 undergoing a @entity295 conversion			1
" he 'd already fallen off the pedestal , " @entity139 argued			0
" all that is left is for a mea culpa -- but i do n't think that is ever going to come			0
" @entity260 is less sure			0
" whether you think @entity3 did drugs or not -- and it looks like he did something -- he still worked his ass off , " she opined			2
" i 've had people come up to me and say ' i 've been an athlete			0
and i know that performance enhancers are not going to help somebody who 's not also working hard			0
' so he 's real driven			0
he 's a perfectionist , and he does n't suffer fools gladly			0
" the last time i talked to him , he said he 's going to get the last word			0
" but first and foremost , he is going to think about his family			0
you ca n't just go throwing yourself on the mercy of the public and want them to love you again			0
" he 's in a tough spot right now			0
