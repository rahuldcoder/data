editor 's note : the staff at @entity3 has been intrigued by the journalism of @entity5 , an independent media company and web site based in @entity7 , @entity8			1
@entity9 is @entity5 's site devoted to the overlap between culture and technology			1
the reports , which are being produced solely by @entity5 , reflect a very transparent approach to journalism , where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process			1
we believe this unique approach is worthy of sharing with our @entity3 readers			2
@entity7 , @entity8 ( @entity9 ) -- you 're on the @entity24			2
what does that mean ? most likely , it means one of a handful of telecommunications providers is middle - manning your information from point a to point @entity33 off an e-mail or a tweet , broadcast a live stream or upload video to @entity38 , and you 're relying on vast networks of fiber optic cables deep underground and undersea , working with satellites high above , to move your data around the world , and to bring the world to your fingertips			1
it 's an infrastructure largely out of sight and mind			2
@entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 -- to most these are simply invisible magicians performing the act of getting one online and kicking			0
to many open - source advocates , however , these are a few of the big , dirty names responsible for what they see as the @entity65 's rapid consolidation			1
the prospect of an irreparably centralized @entity24 , a physical internet in the hands of a shrinking core of so - called @entity70 transit networks , keeps @entity72 up at night			1
@entity72 is the 21 - year - old co-founder of the @entity73			1
@entity74 , vice 's science and technology offshoot , first caught up with @entity72 at @entity79 during the fledgling days of @entity80			1
the @entity82 native seemed to be running on little sleep			0
he 'd gone hoarse from chanting relentlessly over the first three days of a populist movement that would soon sweep the country and the world			2
but there was an undeniable urgency and excitement when @entity72 told us about the efforts of the @entity73 , a non-profit , peer - to - peer communications initiative striving to liberate the global internet from corporate and governmental interference			1
it all sounded lofty and arcane and way , way over our heads			0
but @entity72 seemed committed enough to his drop in the bucket of global revolution , which comes in the form of nine - foot - tall @entity103 that beam out free , secure @entity104 to occupied sites and underserviced communities , that we wanted to hear more			1
see the rest of @entity108 at @entity9			0
if the argument for mesh networking , a sort of pirate radio internet scheme that allows people to talk to one another online through no middle man , is that a centralized ' @entity116 lends itself to the sort of surveillance and censorship that , however futile , strokes the internet kill switch of science fiction , is there a way to circumvent that system altogether ? is there a way to build a new network from the bottom up ? to occupy a fresh internet outside the existing confines of the @entity65 ? or is that all just the stuff of ideological fantasy ? to check the pulse of the @entity24 -- and to get a feel for what life 's like in the digital nerve center of what 's arguably the first fully @entity65 - fueled social movement in @entity140 -- @entity74 has been following @entity72 and @entity141 , communications director for the @entity73 , for the past half year			1
through the thick of occupy marches , in squats and test - lab offices , on rooftops and all places in between , we saw @entity72 , @entity141 and the @entity73 building and perfecting their towers and their humble , cooperatively owned , physical internet			1
we even broke a story that popped off on the internet in the immediate wake of the @entity155 's november 17 raid on @entity79			2
we traveled with @entity72 to a @entity156 shortly after he was released from a 36 - hour stint in jail			1
he was looking for things lost in the early morning sweep of @entity80 's epicenter : cash , his backpack and laptop , @entity79 's @entity162			0
what he found next to a wet heap of clothing and tents were a number of laptops splayed in rows			0
they appeared mangled and snarled			0
one was even stripped of its back casing			0
whether @entity80 's laptops were purposefully destroyed , or merely crunched under the hydraulic mash of a @entity179 garbage truck , remains unclear			0
to be sure , after the incident we contacted the @entity155 , who forwarded us to @entity179			0
sanitation was tasked with hauling away all the abandoned property from @entity79 to an off - site garage , where demonstrators were later allowed to rummage for their belongings			2
a sanitation representative told @entity74 there had been no directive to destroy property , but that he was n't surprised to hear that some items , including laptops , had maybe been mishandled or misplaced			0
in the end , what we came up with is a short documentary called @entity197			2
it 's a story about big dreams and cloudy missions , about complex affiliations and what happens when a @entity204 hack - tech movement confronts the force of the state			1
but beyond that , it 's a story about the incredibly high stakes of living networked in today 's world			0
we all have skin in this game			0
remember : you 're on the @entity24 .			0
