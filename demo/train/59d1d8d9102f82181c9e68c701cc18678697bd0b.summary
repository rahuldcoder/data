@entity0 -- the nation 's growing acceptance of same - sex marriage has happened in slow and painstaking moves , eventually building into a momentum that is sweeping even the most unlikely of converts			1
even though he said in 2008 that he could only support civil unions for same - sex couples , president @entity8 nonetheless enjoyed strong support among the gay community			1
he disappointed many with his conspicuously subdued first - term response to the same - sex marriage debate			1
last year , after vice president @entity17 announced his support , the president then said his position had evolved and he , too , supported same - sex marriage			1
so it was no small matter when on thursday the @entity8 administration formally expressed its support of same - sex marriage in a court brief weighing in on @entity28 's @entity27 , which bans same - sex weddings			1
the administration 's effort was matched by at least 100 high - profile @entity32 â € ” some of whom in elections past depended on gay marriage as a wedge issue guaranteed to rally the base â € ” who signed onto a brief supporting gay couples to legally wed. @entity8 on same - sex marriage : everyone is equal then there are the polls that show that an increasing number of @entity44 now support same - sex marriage			1
these polls show that nearly half of the nation 's @entity48 and white , mainstream @entity50 and more than half of the nation 's women , liberals and political moderates all support same - sex marriage			1
according to @entity58 polling , 48 % of @entity44 support same - sex marriage with 43 % opposed			1
back in 2001 , 57 % opposed same - sex marriage while 35 % supported it			2
in last year 's presidential election , same - sex marriage scarcely raised a ripple			1
that sea change is not lost on the president			0
" the same evolution i 've gone through is the same evolution the country as a whole has gone through , " @entity8 told reporters on friday			0
@entity70 , professor of public policy and political science at @entity74 and @entity74 colleges says there is history at work here and the administration is wise to get on the right side			0
" there is no doubt that president @entity8 's shifting position on @entity27 and same - sex marriage more broadly is due to his desire to situate himself on the right side of history with respect to the fight over same - sex marriage , " said @entity70 , author of " from identity to @entity93 : the @entity94 in the @entity44			1
" " i also think that broader changes in public opinion showing greater support for same - sex marriage , especially among young people , but in the country at large as well , has created a cultural context for @entity8 to alter his views			1
" for years , @entity8 had frustrated many in the gay community by not offering full - throated support of same - sex marriage			1
however , the president 's revelation last year that conversations with his daughters and friends led him to change his mind gave many in that community hope			2
last year , the @entity8 administration criticized a measure in @entity118 that banned same - sex marriage and made civil unions illegal			2
the president took the same position on a similar @entity124 proposal			0
@entity8 administration officials point to what they see as the administration 's biggest accomplishment in the gay rights cause : repealing " do n't ask , do n't tell , " the military 's ban on openly gay and lesbian members serving in the forces			0
then there was the president 's inaugural address which placed the gay community 's struggle for equality alongside similar civil rights fights by women and african - americans			2
" our journey is not complete until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law , for if we are truly created equal , then surely the love we commit to one another must be equal , as well , " @entity8 said in his address after being sworn in			0
in offering its support and asserting in the brief that " prejudice may not be the basis for differential treatment under the law , " the @entity8 administration is setting up a high stakes political and constitutional showdown at the @entity44 @entity160 over a fast - evolving and contentious issue			2
the justices will hear @entity28 's @entity27 case in march			2
that case and another appeal over the federal @entity166 will produce blockbuster rulings from the justices in coming months			0
beyond the legal wranglings there is a strong social and historic component , one that has helped open the way for the administration to push what could prove to be a social issue that defines @entity8 's second term legacy , @entity70 said			0
the nation is redefining itself on this issue , as well			0
@entity58 survey : changing attitudes on gay marriage the changes are due , in part , to generational shifts			0
younger people show a higher level of support than their older peers , according to @entity58 polling " millennials are almost twice as likely as the @entity192 to support same - sex marriage			1
" " as people have grown up with people having the right to marry the generational momentum has been very , very strong , " said @entity194 , president of @entity195 , a gay rights organization			0
that is not to say that there is n't still opposition			0
@entity58 polling found that most republicans and conservatives remain opposed to same - sex marriage			2
in 2001 , 21 % of @entity32 were supportive ; in 2012 that number nudged slightly to 25 %			0
conservative groups expressed dismay at the administration 's same - sex marriage support			1
" president @entity8 , who was against same - sex ' marriage ' before he was for it , and his administration , which said the @entity166 was constitutional before they said it was unconstitutional , has now flip - flopped again on the issue of same - sex ' marriage , ' putting allegiance to extreme liberal social policies ahead of constitutional principle , " @entity213 president @entity212 said in a statement			2
but there are signs of movement even among some high profile @entity32 leaders top @entity32 sign brief supporting same - sex marriage the @entity32 - penned friend of the court brief , which is designed to influence conservative justices on the high court , includes a number of top officials from the @entity240 administration , @entity242 's former campaign manager and former @entity32 presidential candidate @entity243			1
it is also at odds with the @entity32 's platform , which opposes same - sex marriage and defines marriage as a union between a man and a woman			1
still , with @entity253 and high - profile @entity32 support , legal and legislative victories in a number of states and polls that show an increasing number of @entity44 support same sex - marriage , proponents feel that the winds of history are with them			2
" what we 've seen is accelerating and irrefutable momentum as @entity44 have come to understand who gay people are and why marriage matters , " @entity194 said			0
" we now have a solid national majority and growing support across every demographic			0
we have leaders across the spectrum , including @entity32 , all saying it 's time to end marriage discrimination			0
" @entity1 's @entity276 , @entity277 and @entity278 contributed to this report .			0

the president and the nation have shifted perspectives on same - sex marriage
@entity160 ruling on @entity28 's same - sex marriage ban a critical test
growing public support for gay marriage give proponents hope for change
