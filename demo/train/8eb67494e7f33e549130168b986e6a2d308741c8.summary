-- @entity2 pastor @entity1 has been offering an unusual warning these days to members of his church : do n't drive in nearby @entity6			1
it 's not safe , he warns them , because of the sheriff 's department			1
a two - year @entity12 investigation backs up what @entity1 and other @entity13 in the region say they 've known for a long time : traffic stops by @entity6 sheriff 's deputies are sometimes part of a " pattern of racial profiling " aimed at searching for illegal immigrants , according to a statement this week by @entity25 , the assistant @entity26 attorney general for the civil rights division			1
sheriff @entity29 has used offensive language when talking to @entity32 speakers , the statement said , describing them as " @entity35 eaters			1
" deputies were between four to 10 times more likely to stop @entity38 drivers for traffic violations than non-latinos , the @entity12 said			1
many of the stops took place at traffic checkpoints organized by deputies near @entity47 communities			1
latinos were arrested for violations , while others got only warnings or citations , the department said			1
the @entity12 also said hispanics who were jailed after their arrests were discriminated against because they were targeted for immigration status checks			1
read the @entity12 letter of findings on this case ( @entity60 ) the pattern " violates the @entity63 and federal laws , " triggering ripple effects that result in " distrust between the police and the community , " @entity25 's statement said			1
it also " inhibits the reporting of crime and cooperation in criminal investigations			2
" the sheriff vehemently denies the allegations			1
" i do n't know where they got their information from , " @entity29 said when contacted by phone , " but it 's completely false			1
" @entity29 said his attorney had advised him not to comment on the case			2

" i tell them not to go there unless it 's an emergency , " said @entity1 , who came to the @entity26 from his native @entity100 22 years ago			2
@entity1 ' home is about 30 miles away from @entity91 in the @entity6 town of @entity106			2
after living there for nine years , the irony of telling his followers not to visit his own county is n't lost on him			1
" that 's hard , you know , " he said			2
" but you have to tell the people what you have to			0
" the situation is complicated by an agreement between federal @entity119 authorities and the county sheriff 's office			1
the agreement gave deputies additional powers aimed at identifying and arresting illegal immigrants for possible deportation to their home countries			2
the justice accusations have prompted @entity119 to sever that partnership , said @entity119 spokeswoman @entity130			2
the agreements , called 287 ( g ) programs , have long troubled local immigration reform advocates			0
" we applaud the feds for conducting the investigation and its findings , " said @entity134 of the local advocacy group @entity135			0
" but there are still six other counties in the state that participate in the 287 ( g ) program , which is at the bottom of this problem			0
" the programs have been a flash point in other states where immigration has become an issue			0
in @entity152 , @entity153 , the sheriff 's department saw its agreement with federal law enforcement revoked after the @entity12 also accused local authorities of discriminatory police practices			1
@entity119 also has terminated agreements with five other @entity153 law agencies , including the @entity160			0
collaboration under 287 ( g ) continues in 64 communities in 24 states			0
@entity119 also has information - sharing capabilities in more than 3,000 local agencies in all 50 states through a different program known as @entity168			0

" it 's also the fault of the @entity192 administration for empowering these agencies to operate as immigration agencies , " she said			1
to " cut the problem at the root , " she recommends ending all federal programs with local law enforcement that " give them the power of federal agents			0
" the racial makeup of @entity2 is shifting , @entity134 said , and " a lot of white folks in the @entity205 are resistant to change			1
" in the past decades , @entity2 's @entity47 population has skyrocketed			1
hispanics in @entity6 have increased by nearly 500 between 2000 and 2010 , according to the @entity208			0
census statistics also show that the number of @entity47 residents statewide grew by 943 % between 1990 and 2010			0
@entity2 ranks 11th in overall @entity47 population , according to the bureau			1
but @entity134 said @entity13 who were first drawn by industry jobs in the region are now fleeing because the " environment for immigrants in that county is horrible			2
" " we know of people who have packed up after years and years of living there			0
" " a lot of the @entity38 people are here to work , " she said			0
" they 're not harming anyone -- but the last thing they want is to be arrested after they get pulled over			0
" in the wake of the federal accusations against the county sheriff 's office , the @entity12 said that it " will seek to obtain a court enforceable , comprehensive , written agreement remedying the violations			1
" meanwhile , @entity1 said he worries about his friends , family and his church members who look to him for guidance			0
he said his followers worry about being able to trust community law enforcement officers who are supposed to protect them			0
he said all he can do is tell them what may seem obvious in the wake of the @entity12 accusations			1
