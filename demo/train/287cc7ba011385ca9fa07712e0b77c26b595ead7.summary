-- one week after @entity2 beat up the @entity3 , tearing apart homes and lives in @entity6 , @entity7 and other areas , there 's another worry on the horizon : a nor'easter is coming			1
rain is forecast to move in early wednesday and will gradually become heavier , according to @entity0 meteorologists			1
as the day goes on , the weather will get worse , with daytime temperatures hovering in the 40s			1
at night it could get down to the 20s -- bad news for the 127,000 customers who are still without power , according to @entity22			1
working round the clock , the company said tuesday that more than 846,000 customers who lost power -- 87 % -- have it again			1

predicted 60 - mph gusts could hurt the already ravaged @entity33			1
coastal flooding and beach erosion are possible			1
of course there 's a strong concern for everyone 's safety , too			1
@entity2 left 110 people dead in the @entity41 , and on its way to the country , it took the lives of 69 people			1
" when it rains , it pours			1
when it storms , you get more storms , i guess , " said @entity7 gov. @entity49			1
under normal conditions , the nor'easter would n't be problematic , he said , but because many areas are still picking up the pieces from last week , it could cause fresh havoc			1
on monday , authorities in @entity60 , @entity6 , ordered residents in the low - lying waterfront areas of town to leave			2
the storm is not another @entity2 , and its path and severity could change , according to @entity0 meteorologists			2

in everyday lives , progress ca n't come fast enough			1

" what am i supposed to do right now ? how do i deal with that ? " she said			2
" i do n't have electricity , so i can not pump the water			1
it is just sitting there			2
whether someone takes what we have ... i have no control over that			2
i have no control over any of it			2

but she said she has n't been able to reach a real person with the @entity160 yet			1
" we have not been directly contacted , nor can we reach anyone when we call , " she said			2

it 's a humbling experience			0
