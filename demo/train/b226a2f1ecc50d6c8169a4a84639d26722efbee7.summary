-- for all the creative destruction that the @entity3 has wrought over the last decade , there has been one constant : @entity6 's remarkable dominance of the internet economy			1
in a " @entity8 " world dominated by search and by the link , @entity6 and its artificial algorithm have reigned supreme ever since the company 's much vaunted ipo in august , 2004			1
but now , as we go from a @entity8 to a @entity17 economy , even the once invulnerable @entity6 might be in trouble			0
yes , for the first time in a decade , @entity6 's global dominance of the internet economy appears in jeopardy			1
this challenge to @entity6 is twofold -- from both the market and from the government			2
the market threat comes from the increasing ubiquity of social media			2
the link economy is being replaced by the " like " economy in a @entity17 world described by @entity33 co-founder @entity32 as " real identities generating massive amounts of data			0
" and the rise of social media with its avalanche of personal data is , of course , being primarily driven by @entity42 , the locomotive of the like economy , with its near billion members and its expected $ 100 billion ipo later this year			1
the dramatic shift from traditional search to social media was underlined last week in a speech by @entity50 the @entity52 's director for digital development			1
eighteen months ago , @entity50 revealed , search made up 40 % of the @entity52 's traffic and social only made up 2 %			0
last month , however , she acknowledged a " seismic shift " in the @entity52 's referral traffic , with @entity42 driving more traffic than @entity6 and making up more than 30 % of the newspaper 's referrals			0
of course , @entity6 has n't stood still in the face of the @entity42 tsunami			0
first there were the social products @entity65 and @entity66 , both of which were embarrassing failures			0
and then last year , @entity6 launched the " quasi @entity42 competitor " @entity6 + , a product that one ex @entity6 employee believes has " ruined the company " by trying to transform all @entity6 products into social services			1
indeed , @entity6 has even launched a new search product called @entity81 ( @entity80 ) , perhaps the company 's most " radical " move in its history , which determines search results according to social rather than algorithmic criteria			1
while the jury is still out on the success of @entity6 + , with data showing that users spent an average of only 3.3 minutes on the network last month , there is no doubt that @entity6 is relentless about its desire to make itself the center of @entity17 's social world			1
@entity97 , @entity6 's new ceo , has even tied 25 % of all bonuses to the success of the company 's social strategy			1
see more : report : @entity42 bought 750 patents from @entity104 indeed , the problem might be that @entity6 is trying too hard to transform itself into a social company			1
@entity6 's announcement in late january , that it intended to consolidate personal data across its different products and services -- from @entity111 to @entity112 to @entity6 + to @entity80 to google maps to traditional search - had one concerned technology writer suggest that @entity6 will now know more about us than our wives			1
and while senior @entity6 executives like @entity6 + supremo @entity120 promise that they wo n't break users ' trust , more and more pundits fear that @entity6 's obsession with keeping up with @entity42 is making a mockery of its " @entity126 " corporate mantra			2
in my view , @entity6 is no more or less evil than a multi-national bank or oil company			0
but there is good reason to fear the company 's insatiable appetite for our personal data in today 's @entity17 world			0
that 's because @entity6 's business model remains primarily the sale of advertising around its free consumer products			2
thus , @entity6 's desire to intimately know us is primarily driven by its core business objective of -- one way or the other - selling that knowledge to advertisers			1

" governments around the world are , however , waking up to this threat			1
a number of @entity174 lawmakers , for example , questioned the impact of this new policy on users ' privacy			0
while earlier this week , the @entity154 published a 57 - page report of privacy recommendations which included the addition of a " do not track " system intended to give us more control over our online data			0
and last month , the @entity186 proposed its own " @entity188 bill of rights " that depends on voluntary commitments by both @entity6 and @entity42			0
but @entity6 , driven by its @entity42 envy , is in no mood to voluntarily commit to protecting our privacy			0
in spite of overt @entity174 and @entity197 government pressure not to implement a policy that consolidates all our personal data across the company 's many products and services , @entity6 did indeed , on march 1 , unilaterally move ahead with this controversial new privacy policy			2
and herein , i suspect , lies @entity6 's greatest vulnerability			2
late last month , @entity209 's data protection authority , the @entity207 ( @entity207 ) wrote to @entity97 warning him that @entity6 's new privacy policy might be unlawful in the @entity211			2
the @entity207 letter was strongly supported by @entity211 justice commissioner @entity213 , who also requested that @entity6 delayed the implementation of the policy			0
next month , @entity211 regulators , led by competition commissioner @entity217 , will announce their plans for pursuing an antitrust investigation into @entity6 's broad business practices , particularly accusations by a number of companies including @entity224 , @entity225 , @entity226 and @entity227 that it has abused its dominant position in search			2
given all the controversy surrounding the company 's new privacy policy , do n't be surprised if this contributes to @entity217 formalizing the antitrust charges against @entity6			0
i suspect that 2012 will be remembered as the year when @entity6 's fortunes began to wane			1
the company wo n't disappear , of course			0
but with an inexperienced new ceo , a badly botched new privacy policy , a marked decline in public trust and a looming @entity211 antitrust investigation , it is hard to see @entity6 dominating today 's @entity17 world from the same unchallenged position as it once controlled the web 2.0 economy			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity249 .			0

social media and government challenge @entity6 's internet dominance of internet economy
@entity6 is relentless about its desire to make itself the center of the new social world
@entity249 : @entity6 is trying too hard to transform itself into a social company
@entity249 : 2012 will be remembered as the year when @entity6 's fortunes began to wane
