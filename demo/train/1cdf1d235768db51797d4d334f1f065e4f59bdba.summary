@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 's capital awoke to increasing desperation thursday morning , a day and a half after a devastating earthquake , with covered bodies piling up along streets and modern aspects of life , such as electricity , mostly missing			1
the streets of @entity0 resembled grainy black - and - white newsreels from @entity14 that showed the rubble of bombed - out houses in @entity17 and @entity18			1
the devastation was wide and often horrific			2
a one - hour drive from the airport to a walled - in hotel where the @entity2 contingent is staying revealed the widespread destruction from tuesday 's 7.0 - magnitude earthquake			1
flattened and severely damaged houses were found on every block , and the streets were choked with pedestrians and residents			1
they set up overnight camps and slept by the thousands in dark and crowded parks and on sidewalks , for fear of being inside if another powerful quake hit			1
numerous aftershocks have rattled the capital			2
sporadic gunfire was heard wednesday night outside the hotel where @entity2 is lodged			2
sirens could be heard at times , but the predominant sounds in the pre-dawn darkness were the shouts and screams from the thousands of people who spent the night in a dark park across the street			2
a rooster 's crowing could sometimes be heard above the din			2
after electricity in the hotel was shut off at 1 a.m. , @entity2 technicians worked on satellite equipment by flashlight			1
the hotel resembles a compound , with razor wire topping eight - foot walls and a gated parking lot , guarded by a man wielding an old shotgun			2
and although the hotel 's residents seemed safe , and street violence had not been seen , there was a feeling of apprehension			1
as dawn broke , residents wandered slowly through the streets , their destination unknown in a city with seemingly nowhere to go			1
still , there were glimmers of hope that the situation was inching toward improvement			1
the airport , damaged by the quake , began to come back to life wednesday			1
the @entity83 had been closed since the quake struck			2
but by wednesday afternoon , the first small - plane commercial flights started to arrive			2
the airport picked up energy and vitality as planes carrying supplies and ferrying search - and - rescue squads began filling the tarmac			1
@entity92 , manager for @entity1 's @entity93 , was in his airport office on tuesday , sending an e-mail to a friend in @entity97 , when he felt the tremor just before 5 p.m. he stood up and stumbled out of his office but could not go far because the building was shaking so hard			1
" it was an eternity for me , " he said			0
" that building was shaking like a paper			0
" his mother and daughter survived , @entity92 said , but his father is missing			0
" we are all still looking for my father , " he said			0
" we ca n't reach him			0
we do n't know where he is			0
" @entity110 , director of the airport authority , said engineers will examine the structural damage thursday to see if the terminal can be opened again			1
the runway and the electricity are sound , he said			1
if the terminal can not be opened any time soon , @entity110 said , an @entity118 cargo building may be used as temporary terminal			1
he hopes to have 30 - seat commercial airplanes flying into the airport within the next few days			1
large military cargo aircraft were landing routinely and often wednesday afternoon			0
several @entity124 and @entity125 planes stood on the tarmac , their engines running the whole time			0
one took on a load of passengers and left			0
international help also started to arrive			0
thirty - five members of the @entity133 arrived aboard a large jet			0
" they will stay here for as long as it takes , " said @entity135 , a counselor from the @entity137 @entity136 who accompanied the team			0
" we offered to help and @entity1 accepted			1
" a @entity143 military squad also arrived to drop off supplies and a reconnaissance squad , in preparation for a disaster response team scheduled to arrive thursday aboard a c - 17 cargo plane with two helicopters on board			0
the @entity143 crew planned to leave wednesday night to make room for other planes on the crowded tarmac			0
" once i 've dropped that off , i 'm just taking up room , " said capt. @entity155 , the plane 's pilot			0
" i 've got to make room for everyone else			0
i 'm just a bus driver , my friend			0
" @entity118 , which has been flying into @entity0 for 40 years , has brought in 30,000 pounds of water and food and plans to bring in more thursday , said @entity164 , the airline 's managing director for the @entity167			1
as the sun climbed into the sky thursday , the din from the park across the street from the hotel quieted , replaced by an occasional car horn and the chattering of residents speaking their rapid - fire @entity178 patois			2
a small crowd of young men gathered at a concrete wall that had toppled at a home next to the hotel			0
stooped over , they busted the concrete blocks into smaller chunks , their purpose in doing so not readily apparent .			0

bodies pile up in streets ; residents wander , apparently *aimlessly* , in rubble
many @entity1 *sleeping* outdoors for fear more tremors will collapse buildings
but *reopening* of airport , arrival of aid bring glimmer of hope
airport runway and electricity are ok , officials say ; terminal being checked for damage
