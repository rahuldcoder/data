-- cast your mind back to 2008 and to the @entity3 , a time when few had experienced the joy of hashtags and the " like " button was still a twinkle in @entity10 founder @entity9 's eye			1
then the " @entity13 " had just three million " tweeps " , while social - networking monolith @entity10 had a " modest " 100 million users			1
a lot can change in four years ... last week 's @entity17 's opening ceremony provoked more tweets than the entire @entity3 , while @entity10 's 900 million users -- more than the total population of @entity20 -- shared photos and comments about the event			1
' unbelievable ' @entity25 sparks debate no wonder then that 64 years after @entity27 staged the @entity32 " , this time around the @entity30 has been dubbed the first " @entity31			0
" somehow it seemed highly appropriate that the inventor of the world wide web @entity36 was tweeting live while participating in the @entity38 - directed opening ceremony			1
gone are the days of straining to listen to a crackly radio or huddling round a single television set			0
@entity27 2012 enthusiasts are heading straight to their desktops and mobile phones for the latest @entity30 news			0
not that the reaction on social media has been all sweetness and light ... @entity49 cements position as all - time great after finishing fourth in the 10 meter synchronized final , @entity52 diver @entity51 was subjected to insults via @entity54 , some of which related to his late father			1
" four years ago , @entity54 was only two years old , and it had around 3 million users , " explained @entity57 , author of a @entity58 : 365 days in 140 characters			1
" there are now over 140m , and it 's far more mainstream			0
social media generally has become far more popular in that time period , especially when it comes to posting while watching sports events			1
" watching with a ' second screen ' ( i.e. a laptop , tablet or smart phone ) has become much more popular			0
" @entity54 's expansion can also be explained by the proliferation of many of the world 's top athletes equipping themselves with official @entity10 pages and " verified " @entity54 accounts as a way of interacting with their fans			1
. " social media connects the world in real time and fosters a constant conversation about sports , which is exactly what sports fans crave , " said @entity79 , head of sports endorsements at @entity81 , which represents stars like @entity83 and @entity84			1
" for the reporting of results and sharing of experiences by those who are on - hand at the @entity30 , these @entity31 will be unlike any other			0
" according to @entity100 , the links between sports and social media will continue to grow , because followers and likes will ultimately translate into dollars			2
" they can talk to their fans directly , they can talk to each other , they can promote the image of themselves they most want to project , whether that 's by mentioning their charity work , family etc , " she outlined			0
" remember that the more fans a sports star has , the more money they can negotiate when it comes to sponsorship deals			0
your @entity10 and @entity54 stats are a great way to prove how popular you are			2
" @entity79 confirmed an athlete 's " social media footprint " can become a factor during negotiations with potential sponsors , explaining that the more passionate a sports star 's supporters , the more appealing they appear to a brand			2
but @entity79 also stressed millions of followers on @entity54 or thousands of " likes " on @entity10 is useless without sporting success			2
" partners look for ambassadors who have a large and loyal audience , " he said			0
" social media has become a measurable way for brands to connect with an ambassador 's extremely loyal fan base			2
" while having a robust social media presence is not necessarily the deciding factor , a brand that intends to go heavy with a social strategy is absolutely considering the athlete 's social footprint			2
" nonetheless , all the traditional variables still apply -- the profile of the athlete 's sport ; the athlete 's past performance and results			0
good brand ambassadors who have unique @entity30 journeys			0
" while posting a picture on @entity54 is a quick and easy way of promoting sponsors , do athletes risk losing their fan base if social media is used purely for gratuitous advertising ? " our clients like to communicate with their fans and believe in their partners ' messages , brand , and activations , " replied @entity79 , " so sharing that information with their fans seems to come very naturally			1
" @entity100 warned against using @entity54 as a purely sponsor - driven outlet , saying : " i imagine it will continue , but it 's hard to say how people will react			2
like anything , if it 's done gratuitously or obnoxiously , that may get people 's backs up			0
" some olympians have also struggled to remember that a hasty tweet and too much social media exposure can prove costly			2
@entity187 triple jumper @entity185 was kicked out of her country 's @entity30 squad before the @entity31 began for a tweet which was judged to have mocked @entity192 immigrants into the @entity20 nation			0
@entity195 swimmer @entity194 has also allowed @entity54 to ruin her @entity30 dream			1
the 20 - year - old was the favorite heading into the women 's 100 meter backstroke final , having flirted with the world record during the earlier rounds			0
but @entity194 was beaten into the silver medal position by @entity205 teen sensation @entity204 and she blamed her infatuation with social media for her below - par performance			1
" i do n't know , i just felt like i did n't really get off social media and get into my own head , " @entity194 was reported to have said after monday 's final by @entity52 newspaper @entity209			1
" maybe i just started believing that and just thought i 'd already won by the time i had swum and i had n't even swum yet			0
" when people tell you a thousand times ' you 'll get the gold ' , somewhere in your mind you are going to say ' you 've done it '			0
" @entity194 's alarming revelation illustrates the impact social media is having not only on the consumption of sport , but also on the athletes themselves			1
so , with plenty of gold medals still to be won , maybe @entity182 would be best advised to take a social media sabbatical if they want to clinch glory at @entity17 .			1
