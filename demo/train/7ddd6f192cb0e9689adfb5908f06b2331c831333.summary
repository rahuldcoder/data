-- it was like any blind date			1
i had dressed in my saturday best and walked to my favorite brunch restaurant in @entity6 to meet a guy -- let 's call him @entity9 -- for the first time			1
i recognized him from the pictures i 'd seen , and we greeted each other with smiles and a firm handshake			2
we had e-mailed a few times and spoken on the phone to confirm our plans			2
he was polite ; he did n't sit down in his chair until i did , and he paid the bill			2
our conversation was casual to begin with : favorite movies , music , plans for the summer			2
no one would have guessed this setup was to be the start of an arranged marriage			1
most westerners may think the concept of arranged marriage is backward or antiquated -- and if you watch the old @entity35 movies , it can come across that way : two people meet once , or not at all , before their wedding day and then are forced to make a marriage work without even being consulted about their partner			1
in my family , at least , that was rarely the case			2
my parents met and spoke before their wedding day in @entity35 and were asked whether they each saw a future with the other			1
it 's easy for me to rebel against this tradition my family has maintained and say , " that was then , this is now			1
" but despite having been born and raised in @entity53 , where arrangements like this are far from a cultural norm , i understand their perspective			1
all they want for me is security			2
@entity9 had a stable job , and he 's well - educated			1
he is from a well - reputed family and comes highly recommended by family friends as a hard - working , respectful man			0
he was a catch in my parents ' eyes			1
i decided to meet him after nearly a year of my parents pestering me to meet potential mates that i waved off for various reasons -- i was too young , i needed time to start my career off right , i was n't interested , etc. but finally i caved			1
by the time @entity9 and i had finished our brunch that sunny saturday , i knew that a relationship would never work out			0
we had nothing in common except for our heritage , yet i did n't end the date there			1
i felt a responsibility to at least give him a little bit more time			0
i attributed the awkwardness of our interactions to nervousness			0
maybe i was being hypercritical ? did i peg him as a boring because he ordered the fruit plate for brunch when all i wanted was a large omelet ? a part of me wanted something to work out between us ; maybe we could date for a little while and then get married and make everyone happy			1
but as we talked after brunch that day , it was more apparent that a romance between @entity9 and me was n't in the cards			0
his ideals were far more traditional than mine			0
i felt like i needed to be another person around him , not the career - oriented , passionate , food - loving , world - traveling woman that i am			0
i was also headed to graduate school in the fall and had to consider being engaged and trying to start a relationship with someone during that hectic time			0
at the end of our date , he asked whether we could get married that december			2
get married ? i was n't even sure i wanted to have dessert with him ! so i awkwardly tried to skirt around the subject of marriage and explained that i had a lot to think about with grad school coming up			1
i was hoping he 'd mistake my dishonesty for kindness			0
after i went back to @entity121 , where i lived at the time , i discussed the decision with my parents and outlined the reasons why i knew things would never work between @entity9 and me , even though we had n't spent much time together			2
to my surprise , they understood and trusted my judgment			0
i then had the tough task of telling @entity9 we would n't be marrying in december			0
he responded with a polite e-mail telling me he understood my decision			0
i never talked to him again			0
since then , my parents have let the subject of an arranged marriage drop			1
i gave their way a chance and that was enough for them			0
i think they understand i 'm different from my cousins -- and mostly because they raised me to be the person i am today			0
but i do understand their reasons behind trying to get me to consider an arranged marriage			1
it 's not some foreign tradition they arbitrarily adopted to make me miserable or different			1
they want me to find someone they approve of and i can learn to love			0
they want me to be settled , and most importantly they want me to be happy			0
maybe if @entity9 had been my ideal guy , i would have been married by now			0
i wish i could have come back to my parents and told them that all they wanted for me and all i wanted in a husband had aligned in @entity9			1
i do n't know if i 'll end up having an arranged marriage -- likely not			1
but that 's not because i had a horrifying experience			2
what i do know is that until i get married , my mom will be dropping not - so - subtle hints that the best ( @entity165 , birthday , holiday ... ) gift for her would be me getting married			0
and in case you were wondering , @entity9 got married that december , just like he wanted .			2

the *author* 's parents wanted to arrange her marriage , but she *avoided* the subject
her parents had an arranged marriage , following an @entity35 cultural tradition
she finally *agreed* to a date with a potential husband , with interesting *results*
