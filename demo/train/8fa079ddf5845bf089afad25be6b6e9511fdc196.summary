-- doctors often recommend exercise for patients with fibromyalgia , but the chronic pain and fatigue associated with the condition can make activities like running and swimming difficult			1
@entity10 -- a slow , meditative martial art -- may be an effective alternative , a new study suggests			1
fibromyalgia patients who took tai chi classes twice a week for three months experienced less pain , stiffness , and fatigue than a control group that attended lifestyle education and stretching sessions , according to the study , which was published in the @entity22			1
@entity10 involves a series of slow , fluid movements that focus on balance and deep breathing			0
although it 's not clear from the study how exactly tai chi might improve fibromyalgia symptoms , both the physical activity and the meditative aspects are likely beneficial , says @entity33 , @entity34 , the lead researcher and an associate professor at the @entity36 , in @entity37 , @entity38			1
" some people need the physical improvement ; some people need more mental improvement , " she says			0
" @entity10 can help with both			0
" @entity0 : how fibromyalgia is diagnosed previous research has shown that tai chi can help relieve the symptoms of arthritis and other pain conditions , but this study is the first controlled trial to examine its effectiveness as a treatment for fibromyalgia , which affects an estimated 10 million @entity54			1
the study included 66 fibromyalgia patients who were randomly assigned to take one - hour tai chi classes with an experienced teacher or one - hour classes that taught coping skills , pain - management techniques , and stretching			1
participants were also asked to practice tai chi or stretch on their own for 20 minutes each day , depending on which group they were in			0
@entity0 : 13 mistakes fibro patients make after three months , @entity66 and her colleagues asked the patients to rate their pain symptoms , physical functioning , fatigue , and mood , all of which were combined on a single scale ranging from 0 to 100 , with higher scores indicating more severe symptoms			0
( the patients completed the same survey before the study began			0
) the average score among the tai chi patients dropped from 63 to 35 , while the average for the control group dropped by just nine points , from 68 to 59			2
three months after the sessions stopped , the scores had remained roughly the same , which suggests that the benefits of the tai chi were lasting , @entity66 says			1
the results were encouraging , as existing fibromyalgia treatments -- including medication , sleep therapy , and aerobic exercise -- fail to help many patients			0
" we need another approach , " says @entity66			0
@entity0 : medical marijuana may help fibromyalgia pain @entity101 , @entity34 , an associate professor at @entity102 and the clinical chief of rheumatology at @entity105 , in @entity37 , says that he often recommends alternative treatments , such as acupuncture and massage , to his fibromyalgia patients , although some of them are skeptical			2
" i would certainly put tai chi on the list , " says @entity101 , who co-wrote an editorial that accompanies the study			2
" it 's difficult to take something that 's as safe as tai chi and show that it has this dramatic benefit and not be enthusiastic about it			0
" the calming style of tai chi used in the study , known as @entity123 , may be especially effective for fibromyalgia patients , says @entity125 , @entity126 , an associate professor at the @entity127 , in @entity128			1
" it works more on the parasympathetic nervous system , ... the part of the nervous system that helps us feel calm and relaxed , " says @entity125 , who studies @entity123 - style tai chi and yoga in fibromyalgia but was n't involved in the study			1
@entity0 : 13 conditions that mimic fibromyalgia @entity125 recommends that fibromyalgia patients find a well - trained instructor rather than trying tai chi on their own			1
she points out that learning tai chi in a group may have its own therapeutic benefits , by boosting confidence , for instance			2
many community centers offer affordable tai chi classes , but experienced teachers can be expensive and hard to come by			2
however , if future studies support the benefits of tai chi , insurance companies might start to cover the practice , @entity101 says			0

study suggests @entity10 as a good exercise for fibromyalgia patients
@entity160 experienced less pain , stiffness and fatigue
doctor says the benefits of tai chi were also lasting
