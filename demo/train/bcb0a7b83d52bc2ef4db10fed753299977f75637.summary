-- champions of equal protection had their day in court -- but it was a highly politicized day in the @entity4			2
unlike the 1967 interracial marriage case of loving v. @entity11 , the gay rights decision in @entity6 v. @entity7 , while also a victory for civil rights , is not a moment of legal clarity or coherence			1
in court politicization , @entity7 is closer to @entity16			1
the @entity20 case , at 9 - 0 , was a victory for civil rights wrapped in a moment of @entity4 clarity ; 5 - 4 @entity7 is a victory wrapped in a @entity4 food fight			1
almost a half - century ago , chief justice @entity27 delivered a unanimous decision of the @entity4 , invalidating state laws prohibiting interracial marriage			1
sixteen states maintained such laws , including @entity11			0
loving invalidated laws banning interracial marriage			1
@entity7 invalidated federal law denying benefits to homosexual couples married in states permitting same - sex marriage			1
a comparison of the two cases reveals how divided and divisive our court is today			2
@entity43 and @entity20 were a mixed - race couple validly married in the @entity45 , who upon returning home to @entity11 faced continuing arrest and harassment by local police for violating @entity11 's miscegenation laws			1
after a decade - long cat - and - mouse game with the local authorities and a parallel odyssey through @entity11 courts , the @entity52 were vindicated when a unanimous @entity4 held that state miscegenation laws were unconstitutional since they " rest solely on distinctions drawn according to race " and have " no legitimate overriding purposes independent of invidious racial discrimination which justifies this classification			2
" the court held marriage to be among the " basic civil rights " that no state can infringe			2
several years ago , the documentarian @entity68 asked me to executive produce " the @entity72 , " a documentary film chronicling a civil rights story and a love story			0
@entity6 loved loving , with its legal and moral clarity			1
the film was a top performer at the 2011 @entity82 @entity81			0
@entity76 began airing it on television on @entity85 2012			0
this year the film won a @entity87			0
loving v. @entity11 was notable for its coherence as the court 's resolution of a legal odyssey			1
today 's legal culture includes conservative judges accusing jurists of partisanship at every turn , even the hardest cases			0
the dissent in @entity7 excoriates the majority as " hungry " to grandstand in a case it claims was never properly before the court -- ignoring that @entity7 had won a judgment for an estate - tax refund that the @entity6 government refused to honor unless the @entity4 would invalidate the @entity110			1
justice @entity111 was wedded to his technicalities and indifferent to ms. @entity7 's equities			2
the dissent slams the majority for " rootless and shifting " reasoning and claims the majority views @entity110 's supporters as having " hateful hearts , " a politicized barb at odds with the muted language with which the majority duly inspected the legislative purpose of @entity110			0
@entity111 is erudite but dead wrong in claiming , " in the majority 's telling , this story is black and white			0
hate your neighbors or come along with us			0
" come again ? @entity110 said the federal government could declare the validly married same - sex couple next door unqualified for any federal benefits extended to married heterosexual couples			1
and the court 's majority is mongering hate ? joining the politicized dissent is justice @entity140 : " the family is an ancient and universal human institution " and " changes in family structure and in the popular understanding of marriage and the family can have profound effects			2
" one struggles to rest much on these generalities			0
similarly one would struggle to rely much on the broad intonations of the overruled state court judge in @entity20 : " @entity152 created the races white , black , yellow , malay and red , and he placed them on separate continents			1
and , but for the interference with his arrangement , there would be no cause for such marriage			0
the fact that he separated the races shows that he did not intend for the races to mix. " the entire 1967 court could spot poppycock when it saw it			1
chief justice @entity27 , concerned with precedent more than politics , probably nonetheless had to do some arm twisting to get unanimity , but he got it			0
in 2013 , by contrast , a virulent dissent offers new polemics -- and then accuses the majority of being politicized			0
@entity20 ended with legal and moral clarity			1
the @entity179 headline read , " justices @entity180 on @entity182 , 9 - 0 decision rules			1
" @entity7 ended with , well , democracy still working its virulent ways , including at the court , whose members of its right flank were knitting angrily in their chambers			2
the dissent reaches for judicial temperament but unleashes judicial temper			0
perhaps it is time for a new documentary , " the @entity195			0
" this one too will have a happy ending for the original petitioners , but this time told through the lens of @entity100			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity202 .			2

@entity202 : @entity204 won for same - sex marriage , but it was far from a slam dunk
in 1967 , court ruled 9 - 0 in loving that interracial marriage ban was unconstitutional
he says @entity20 had legal and moral clarity ; @entity7 case at 5 - 4 vote was politically charged
