astonishingly , the calls -- including several to @entity22 -- were made within a single 24 - hour period , a fact that 'll do little to reduce concerns about the high cost of roaming charges both in @entity4 and the rest of the world			1
the complaint about the bill was made by a man identified as " @entity31 " whose son had his phone stolen during a trip to @entity9			1
" he reported the theft to local police and to his provider in @entity4 , but because of the time difference between the continents , the provider recorded the theft as having happened a day later than it occurred , " the ombudsman said in a report			2
" back in @entity4 , his son 's bill came to more than aus $ 570,000 ( $ 517,000 ) and listed calls to @entity22			1
" huge data charges the story has a relatively happy ending : after the ombudsman stepped in , the phone provider eventually agreed to waive its demands			0
