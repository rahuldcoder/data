@entity0 -- now that @entity5 ambassador @entity4 has withdrawn her name from consideration for secretary of state , her supporters are criticizing those who brought her down as well as president @entity10 , a long - time friend , who they say left her twisting in the wind			1
" i 'm not just disappointed that president @entity10 did n't go forward ( with the nomination )			1
he accepted her resignation not to put her name forward , " @entity15 , @entity1 political contributor and @entity18 strategist , said on the @entity19			1
" i can understand that the president does n't want to use all of his political capital , re-fight these battles , " @entity15 said			0
" they had the knives out for @entity4 , a whole bunch of people			2
this is an old boys ' network			0
this is how it operates			0
" @entity4 withdraws her name from consideration as secretary of state @entity35 withdrew her name from consideration to become the top @entity37 diplomat on thursday after drawing heavy criticism from @entity40 sen. @entity39 and other @entity41 over her public statements about the deadly attack on the @entity37 diplomatic mission in @entity45 , @entity46 , in september			1
in a letter to @entity10 , she said the @entity52 " confirmation process would be lengthy , disruptive , and costly â € ” to you and to our most pressing national and international priorities			2
that trade off is simply not worth it to our country			0
" last month , @entity10 defended @entity35 at a @entity57 press conference and challenged her @entity41 detractors to " go after me " and calling the character attacks " outrageous			1
" but @entity10 stalled for weeks on @entity35 or anyone else , which indicated her prospects for the job were dim			1
ultimately , @entity35 's possible nomination was a casualty of a deeply partisan climate in an ongoing political showdown between @entity10 and @entity41 over the handling of the @entity46 attack that killed ambassador @entity70 and three other @entity37 , said @entity71 , editor of @entity72			1
a lucky day for @entity4 " the @entity35 incident does not represent a significant deviation from the partisan standards of the recent past in @entity0 , " @entity71 said			1
" in other words , every so often a candidate is targeted and blocked by one party or the other			0
it happens more often ( with ) the @entity82 than with @entity84 posts or ambassadorships			0
" @entity35 became the administration 's point person on explaining events in @entity45			2
in multiple tv appearances just days after the attack , @entity35 said the violence apparently was linked to a protest over an @entity95 film produced in the @entity37			2
senior @entity37 officials have said @entity35 's comments were based on an intelligence assessment that was later revised to reflect the belief that it was a planned terrorist assault			2
@entity39 was withering in his criticism of the administration 's initial public explanation			0
he said " this president and this administration has either been guilty of colossal incompetence or engaged in a cover up , neither of which are acceptable to the @entity37 people			0
" @entity39 is well known for his bluntness but @entity35 also has a reputation for being a aggressive and an effective operator in the corridors of power during her years in @entity0			2
" i guess my theory is that she 's a sharp - tongued , blunt person , and , in the past , she has taken some shots at @entity39 and others , and so this is their chance , " conservative @entity116 columnist @entity115 said recently on @entity118 ' newshour of @entity41 criticism of @entity35 before her withdrawal			2
opinion : an unfair portrait of @entity4 " they have no wellspring of sympathy with her , the way they actually probably do with @entity134 , her potential rival to be the next secretary of state , having taken a bunch of delegation trips with @entity134 around the world			1
and so , i suspect there 's a lot of old history here that is bubbling up , " he said			0
during the 2008 presidential campaign , @entity35 , who was then serving as the @entity10 campaign 's senior foreign policy adviser , called @entity39 's proposed terrorism policies " dangerous			1
" other factors in the @entity35 saga were at play as well , @entity71 said			0
" i think it is more complicated than that and has roots associated with a variety of other factors : the political origins of the debate over @entity45 during the campaign , @entity39 's dissatisfaction with answers @entity35 gave him in person ( that deepened his concerns ) , his ties to and preference for other choices for the job , and so on , " @entity71 said			1
@entity35 was reportedly defensive during her followup meetings with lawmakers aimed at addressing their concerns with her @entity45 comments			0
that apparent impression raised red flags with other senators on the fence about her prospects for higher office @entity39 is seeking a slot on the @entity182 next year to be in a position to help weigh in on the next secretary of state and could be in place to question @entity134 , a fellow decorated @entity187 veteran , if he is nominated to the position			0
@entity39 , who has a good relationship with @entity134 , and other @entity41 senators have said they would prefer to see the @entity193 @entity192 and current foreign relations chairman , running @entity37 diplomacy			0
@entity35 once appeared to be the inevitable secretary of state @entity1 's @entity196 , @entity197 , @entity198 and @entity199 contributed to this report .			1

@entity35 withdrew her name from any consideration as secretary of state
some @entity18 disappointed president @entity10 did not more *strongly* support @entity35
politics , personal ties complicated any effort to nominate @entity4 as secretary of state
