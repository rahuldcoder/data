-- what 's the age at which older men are no longer allowed to compliment women in their 20s on being beautiful ? is there an age when such compliments go from nice to creepy ? and is there a similar rule that bars older women from calling younger men " handsome " ? we ask because of the uproar that erupted this week when 73 - year - old @entity16 sportscaster @entity15 made a slew of comments -- on air -- about the beauty of 23 - year - old @entity21 , the reigning miss @entity22			1
he did this during monday 's national championship college football game between @entity22 and @entity27 ; @entity28 is dating @entity22 quarterback @entity29 and was in the stands for the game			0
here 's what he said when the cameras focused on @entity28 during the broadcast : " ... you see that lovely lady there ? she does go to @entity38 , i 'll admit that , but she 's also @entity22 , and that 's @entity29 's girlfriend			1
wow , i 'm telling ya , you quarterbacks , you get all the good - looking women			0
what a beautiful woman ! whoa ! so if you 're a youngster in @entity22 , start getting the football out and throw it around the backyard with pops			0
" and boom ! cue the controversy			0
people attacked @entity15 as " creepy , " for ogling her too much , for being a " dirty old man , " for being sexist , inappropriate , and more			1
one publication even went so far as to claim that @entity15 's comments are " evidence " of " a culture of domestic violence and sexual assault in football			1
" @entity21 : media unfair to @entity15 the attacks on @entity15 reached such a deafening crescendo that @entity16 issued a statement : " we apologize that the commentary in this instance went too far and @entity15 understands that			1
" i 'm glad @entity15 understands it , because i do n't			2
can someone please explain to me where @entity15 went too far ? @entity15 did n't imitate @entity71 and evaluate @entity28 's physical attributes part by part so he could decide if she was attractive enough to pose for @entity75 ? @entity15 did n't utter a truly creepy remark like @entity77 did when recently interviewing actress @entity78 after her wardrobe malfunction and opening the interview with his comment : " seen a lot of you lately			1
" @entity15 did n't continue with a running commentary of @entity28 's beauty during the telecast			1
he did n't abandon the announcer booth and run down to the stands in the hopes of getting a date with her			0
nope , he just made a few comments about ms. @entity21 's beauty in the span of 15 to 20 seconds			0
but in this day of instant outrage and instant access to social media to vent it , that was enough to create a media storm			0
news : game ? what game ? there 's a pretty woman in the stands the only criticism that 's arguably fair is @entity15 's implication that if you are great quarterback , you will have earned a beautiful woman -- a reward , more than a human being			1
if that had been @entity15 's intention , that , of course , would have been wrong			1
however , if you listen to the actual broadcast , you can clearly tell from @entity15 's tone that that was not his point			2
c'mon , we all know the difference between when people are being playful and when they are being hateful			0
by objecting to mere playfulness , well - intentioned people are going to undermine their credibility when they latter offer criticism on issues that really are objectionable			2
and let 's be brutally honest : if @entity15 had been a 73 - year - old woman and gushed over how handsome a 23 - year - old man was , would there be any uproar at all ? of course not			1
but for those who still have issues with @entity137 , maybe @entity28 's own comments on wednesday morning 's " today " show will sway you : " i think the media has been really unfair to [ @entity137 ] ... if he would 've said something along the line that we were hot or sexy or made any derogatory statements like that , i think that would 've been a little bit different , but the fact that he said that we were beautiful and gorgeous , i do n't see why any woman would n't be flattered by that			2
" and @entity28 's parents have even come to the defense of the sports announcer			0
indeed , her father 's comments to the media i think best sum up the entire situation : " ... he was trying to be complimentary , and i think they need to give @entity15 a break			2
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity168 .			0

@entity15 commented on air that a player 's girlfriend was " lovely "
@entity168 asks : why should @entity16 have apologized for the remark ?
@entity168 : would a 73 - year - old woman be *slammed* for such a comment about a man ?
he says *overwrought* critics hurt their credibility when a real outrage arises
