@entity0 , @entity1 -- it 's been more than a year since a racial slur threatened to end the television career of @entity6 " @entity7			1
but the incident still weighs heavily on his mind			2
@entity6 " @entity7 watches his son 's baseball game this month in @entity0 , @entity1			1
@entity13 briefly suspended his top - rated reality show in late 2007 , and his reputation was on the line			1
now , with his show back on the air and at the top of the network 's ratings list , @entity7 insists that he does not want the controversy to be forgotten			1
" they said , ' it 'll pass , ' and i said to the guy , ' you know what ? i wo n't let it			2
' " @entity7 , 56 , spoke candidly about accusations of racism on a recent windy saturday afternoon on the sidelines of 8 - year - old son @entity32 's baseball game			1
it was his other son , @entity35 , who recorded a profanity - laced conversation with his father and reportedly sold the recording -- which included @entity7 repeatedly using the " n - word " -- to the @entity40 in 2007			1
some @entity43 - @entity42 leaders called for the cancellation of his show			1
@entity7 said he was advised to lay low for several weeks , but he refused			1
" all the spin doctors ... all those guys told me , ' @entity45 , say that you were this , say you were that , [ but ] if you go out there , you 're done			2
' i said , ' i 'm going out in a hail of glory			2
you may call me a convict ... but you ai n't gon na call me something i 'm not			2
i 'm going out swinging			2
' " @entity7 said his meetings with leaders of the black community were more than an attempt to redeem himself in the public eye and get his show back on the air			1
in a february 8 , 2008 , foreword to his book , " @entity62 , " he writes that " giving up cussing is just the first step toward my evolution as a human			2
" he said he was referring to his use of the racial slur , which he admits -- even on the recording -- knowing that it would spark public outrage			1
but as a former prison inmate of mixed ethnicity -- he is part @entity75 -- @entity7 said he felt he could use the word without it defining him as a racist			1
" i was with 38,000 black men at the age of 22 in the ' 70s , the [ prison ] guards -- whether they 're black or white -- called them that [ the slur ] every day , " he said			1
" once i said it and met with leaders of the black community and realized what that word meant , that 's when i said , ' i will never again utter that word			0
' " he said , " i do n't give a damn that [ it ] was a private call they burglarized ; i knew not to do that			0
i did n't know not to say the word because what it would do , but i do now			0
now if you catch me [ saying it ] , you wo n't have to stop my show , i 'll resign			1
" controversy is something that @entity7 draws on ; it defines his character both publicly and privately			1
he ran with motorcycle gangs before he was convicted of first - degree murder and sentenced to a five - year prison term in 1977			0
he maintains his innocence and served a fraction of the sentence			0
his determination to prove he was the world 's best bounty hunter led him to @entity110 in 2003 , where he and his team captured the heir to the @entity115 cosmetics fortune , @entity116 , who was convicted in absentia on charges of rape			0
the @entity110 government charged @entity7 and his team with kidnapping and demanded their extradition , but the charges later were dropped			1
his life story of an ex-con - turned - vigilante is the hallmark of his celebrity and leads many people to tune in to his show , which began in 2004			1
@entity7 said his fans perceived the racial slur incident differently			1
" not one black person to this day has walked up to me and said anything bad ; it 's all been the whites , " he said			0
" [ others said ] , ' you know here 's a bounty hunter , was convicted , went to prison , 30 years later he 's arrested 7,000 people			0
you think he might say a couple bad words			0
' that 's the good things that were said to me			0
" his 10 - year - old daughter , @entity150 , heard about what happened on the radio			1
" and she goes , ' @entity154 , you know you ca n't use that [ word ] , you 're not a rapper			0
ok , love you , @entity154 , see you			0
' and i 'm like , ' and is that what your friends are saying ? ' ' @entity159 , they know you 're not a rapper			0
they know you 're @entity45			0
and it was over , just like that			0
" while some of his viewers have forgotten the controversy , @entity7 does not want it to go away -- particularly the accusations that were leveled against him in the media			1
" you better not forget the s * * * you put me through over that			0
i ai n't lettin ' ' em forget it			0
you think black guys forget it ? it hurts my feelings to hear it [ the slur ]			2
so , yeah , there 's such a thing as passing , but i never heard of that			2
" he added , " i understand the saying now , ' lest ye forget			0
' do n't ever forget that			0
please do n't forget that , that i went through that			0
