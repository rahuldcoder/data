-- @entity2 rep. @entity1 thursday announced his intention to run for a seat in the @entity5 , a move that sets up what is likely to be a showdown between two prominent families in one of the country 's most politically divided states			1
former house republican whip @entity1 announced he will run for a @entity14 seat			1
making the official announcement in @entity19 , @entity2 , the former @entity17 @entity16 whip indicated he would run on a platform of keeping @entity22 control of both @entity23 and the @entity17 in check			1
" common sense and open debate are in danger of being suppressed by the overreaching liberal monopoly in @entity23 and the @entity17 , " he said , according to prepared remarks			2
" never has @entity30 been in greater need of hearing from people who work hard , pay their taxes and want solutions to urgent economic problems and the ongoing threat of terrorism			2
" " my sense is @entity43 and @entity44 are not well served by one - party rule , " @entity1 also said , citing the massive stimulus measure signed by president @entity40 that won little @entity16 support			0
@entity1 's announcement comes two weeks after @entity48 @entity47 jumped into the race			1
@entity47 is another missourian with prominent name recognition who enjoys widespread support			1
" the @entity14 race is shaping up to be one of the most competitive races of the cycle , " said @entity54 , political editor of the @entity55			0
" it has attracted two of the biggest names of the state that has a history of closest elections			0
" both @entity1 and @entity47 are seeking the @entity5 seat set to be vacated by longtime @entity2 @entity16 @entity67			1
@entity1 , a six - term congressman representing the state 's conservative southwestern corner , is a longtime @entity2 politician with high name recognition across the state and solid support among his party 's conservative base			1
he has run for statewide office several times during his nascent political career , having served as secretary of state for two terms before losing the @entity16 primary for governor in 1992			0
his son @entity81 also served as the state 's governor from 2005 - 2009 , but ultimately decided not to seek another term because of low approval ratings			0
@entity1 faces a state that has become increasing @entity22 in the last several election cycles			1
the state 's other @entity5 seat went @entity22 in 2006 with @entity91 's narrow win , and @entity48 @entity92 was elected governor of the state in 2008			1
but @entity16 still hold edges in the state 's @entity17 and @entity5 chambers and have a majority of the state 's nine congressional seats			0
while @entity1 is likely to enjoy the support of the party 's establishment , he could face a competitive primary challenge from former state treasurer @entity105 , a vocal critic of her party 's leadership who narrowly lost a bruising primary bid for governor last year			2
even though she is not particularly popular in her party , @entity105 's message of reform could resonate if the @entity16 's national approval ratings remain low throughout the next two years			0
" republicans would like to avoid a primary in the @entity5 race , but she 's not the kind of person they will be able to just shove out of a race , " @entity54 said			0
" she relishes in being in an outsider role			0
" but should @entity1 make it to a general election facing @entity47 , the race will likely become a hard - fought and high - profile battle of two powerful political names			1
@entity47 's father , @entity126 , served as governor of the state from 1993 - 2000 and died in a plane crash while running for the @entity5			1
@entity47 still won the seat , defeating then - @entity16 sen. @entity130 , and @entity47 's wife @entity131 held the post for two years			1
@entity47 's brother is also a @entity44 congressman representing the outskirts of @entity19			2
but national @entity22 are eager for a match - up against @entity1 , who was a protégé to former house majority leader @entity136 and has been linked to disgraced lobbyist @entity137			2
" as one of the faces of the same old @entity16 , @entity1 enters this race with a whole lot of baggage and a whole lot of questions to answer , " said @entity138 , the @entity140 's communication 's director			0
@entity22 will also highlight @entity1 's stalwart support of former president @entity149 , especially when it comes to economic policies			2
" i 'd hate to be him , and explaining my votes on the @entity149 positions , " @entity140 chairman @entity152 said of @entity1 last week			0
" they got their ideas into law			0
it created one of the worst economies i have ever seen			0
