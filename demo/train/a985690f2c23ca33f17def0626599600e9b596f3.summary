" the colorful , electric sign was something of an unusual and unexpected greeting for @entity5 @entity0 , 35 , who this week embarked on a landmark visit to @entity7 , @entity8 's largest border town			1
separated by a river from @entity11 's @entity10 and easily accessible from @entity10 by car or train , @entity7 has long been a popular @entity8 destination for @entity11 tourists but was pretty much off - limits to @entity18 visitors until now			1
the most a westerner could experience was the view from the train and station platform during transit from @entity11 to the secretive country			2
@entity0 is general manager of @entity26 - based @entity25 -- one of the biggest tour companies specializing in @entity8 travel			0
he says his visit was a result of 10 years of lobbying " the right people " on the local tourism ladder			1
" we 've been putting pressure on them for years , and we believed @entity7 in particular would be easier to gain access to because of all the tourist infrastructure already in place , and because the people there are used to seeing foreign visitors , " @entity0 told @entity1			1
@entity25 guided approximately half of the 5,000 @entity18 tourists to @entity8 last year , the company says			1
behind the veil : a rare look at life in @entity8 ' @entity48 ' following meetings with officials , @entity0 's sights included the local park , classic revolutionary monuments , mosaics , the railway station , a provincial revolutionary museum , a local kindergarten well known throughout the country , the riverside and a look at the " @entity48 " -- the old bridge to @entity10 which was bombed during the @entity62			0
" it 's an interesting town and there 's definitely a border town vibe , " said @entity0 , adding that the @entity11 influence from traders and businessmen who come to @entity7 every day is very prevalent			1
most of the international commercial trade with @entity8 is said to pass through @entity7			2
however , that does not make it a rich town			0
" it 's not a very well - off place , especially compared to @entity76 , which is the richest place in @entity8 , " said @entity0			0
@entity8 's ' hotel of doom ' opening debacle continues cheaper trip the tour company believes the different vibe of the town will make it a popular destination for @entity18 visitors			1
the other draw is that it 's a cheaper trip			0
" until now , you had to go in for a minimum of at least three days but @entity7 can be a day trip as well as an add - on to other @entity8 tours , " said @entity88 , 32 , the founder of @entity89 , a budget @entity8 tour company for @entity18 based in @entity92 , @entity11			1
@entity89 has also been lobbying for the @entity7 opening for the past two years , and will be taking in a test tour group to the border town this sunday			1
" my personal opinion is that this came about because @entity11 stopped all @entity11 tours to @entity8 due to recent tensions , " @entity88 told @entity1			2
how to travel to @entity8 both tour companies are still waiting for pricing information from their local partner companies before they officially begin charging for @entity7 day trips or tour add - ons			1
restrictions still apply -- those with @entity111 or @entity113 passports can not visit @entity7 ( journalists ca n't as tourists and visitors with @entity117 passports ca n't enter @entity8 at all )			1
living history some , including readers commenting on @entity1 articles , have described travel to @entity8 as unethical , arguing it helps fund @entity76			0
@entity0 says he believes establishing human contact with the outside world is important for @entity8 civilians			0
" we believe that there is value in taking people there and raising awareness among the @entity8 people of what the outside world is like by simple human level contact , which is sadly lacking , " he said			0
and the appeal of @entity8 to the @entity18 tourist ? for @entity88 , that 's a no - brainer			2
" the world is getting very similar , " said @entity88			0
" even in @entity11 there are so many streets where i look at the shops and i could be anywhere in the world			2

there 's not as much adventure left in the world as we would like			0
