-- @entity2 through his presidency , @entity1 was asked by the journalist @entity4 to name his biggest mistake since 9/11 and what he 'd learned from it			1
here 's what he said : " hmmm ... i wish you 'd have given me this written question ahead of time so i could plan for it			2
uhhh ... ( six - second pause ) " @entity4 , i 'm sure historians will look back and say , gosh , he could 've done it better this way or that way			0
uhhh ... ( five second pause )			0
you know , i just -- uhhh - i 'm sure something will pop into my head here in the midst of this press conference , with all the pressure of trying to come up with answer , but it had n't yet			1
... " @entity1 then babbled about how he would not have done anything differently in @entity30 , how @entity31 was a bad guy and how he was confident the truth would come out about weapons of mass destruction ( well , he was right about that			1
after filling air and killing time with that nonsense , he tried to return to @entity4 's question			0
but @entity1 's eyes looked like a slot machine that had just hit @entity42			1
he said : " i hope -- i do n't want to sound like i have made no mistakes			1
i 'm confident i have			0
i just have n't -- heh , heh -- you just put me under the spot here , and maybe i 'm not as quick on my feet as i should be in coming up with one			2
" ( you can see it for yourself here : @entity48 ) one of the biggest reasons @entity50 is president -- and a @entity52 winner -- is that he 's not @entity1			1
this week he proved that again			0
whereas @entity1 could n't name a single mistake -- not , say , letting @entity55 escape from @entity56 , or refusing to allow weapons inspectors to ascertain that @entity31 had no weapons of mass destruction , or backing economic policies that took the greatest budget surplus in @entity63 history and turned it into the biggest deficit in history -- @entity50 has stepped up			1
his statement on tuesday was close , but no cigar			0
refreshingly he acknowledged screw - ups and pledged to get to the bottom of the mistakes and correct them			0
he said , " the system has failed in a potentially disastrous way			0
... the intelligence community failed to connect those dots			0
" that was a good start , but it did n't go far enough for me -- nor , apparently , for our president			2
because on thursday he took full responsibility			2
" ultimately , " he said , " the buck stops with me			1
as president , i have a solemn responsibility to protect our nation and our people , and when the system fails , it is my responsibility			2
" hallelujah ! the president also released a report detailing the failures that allowed a man to very nearly kill 300 people on christmas day , he has ordered the government to enhance screening and detection , to increase the use of federal air marshals and to improve the dissemination and integration of intelligence			0
in short , our president is taking his responsibility to protect us more seriously than his political instinct to protect his own backside			1
what a change , what a relief , what a difference			0
in taking responsibility , @entity50 did the right thing for our country and his presidency			1
he also showed that a skinny , thoughtful community organizer has a lot more guts than a blustering @entity121 posing as a cowboy			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity125 .			1

@entity125 recalls that @entity1 could n't name his biggest mistake
he says @entity1 administration never owned up for grave errors
he says @entity50 set a refreshing tone by saying the buck stops with him
@entity135 : in taking responsibility , @entity50 did right thing for the country
