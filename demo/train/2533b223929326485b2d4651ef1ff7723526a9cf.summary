@entity11 press secretary @entity10 called for expanding he negotiations with opposition groups , lifting the state of emergency and making constitutional changes to bring about democratic elections			1
" we think more has to be done , and more importantly , i think the people of @entity6 think more has to be done , " @entity10 told reporters			1
in a sign of increasing tension between the @entity23 and @entity6 over the demonstrations that began january 25 , @entity6 's foreign minister said in a @entity23 television interview that the @entity3 administration should back off from pushing president @entity27 to speed up the reform process			1
" when you speak about prompt , immediate , now , " foreign minister @entity31 told @entity32 , " it is " as if you are imposing on a great country like @entity6 , a great friend that has always maintained the best of relationship with the @entity23 , you are imposing your will on him			1
" @entity31 said the @entity23 government should " better understand the @entity6 sensitivities and better encourage the @entity6 to move forward and to do what is required -- that is my advice to you			1
" in particular , he rejected the call for lifting the state of emergency that has been in place for three decades , saying the special security powers were needed now that thousands of prisoners had been freed during the chaos of the demonstrations			2
" how can you ask me to sort of disband that emergency law while i 'm in difficulty ? " @entity31 said			0
" give me time , allow me to have control to stabilize the nation , to stabilize the state and then we would look into the issue			0
" at the same time , @entity31 called the situation in @entity6 " an upheaval that is transforming @entity6 from one era to a new era , " and insisted that @entity27 and his new vice president , @entity59 , have embarked on an irreversible path of reforms sought by the demonstrators and the @entity23			1
he compared his government 's situation to being " in a boat in the midst of the @entity73 ( river ) moving from one bank to the other , " adding : " give us the time to row and to go with the current and see how we will reach that point			0
" @entity10 , however , said it was the people of @entity6 who needed to see concrete steps toward the changes they seek , and that the @entity3 administration was merely expressing the reality of the situation			1
" i think it is clear that what the government has so far put forward has yet to meet the minimum threshold of the people of @entity6 , " @entity10 said , later adding : " i think if there 's some notion on the government side that you can put the genie back in this bottle , i think that 's gone a long time ago			1
" asked about past warnings that the @entity23 could withhold some or all of the more than $ 1 billion in annual military aid to @entity6 , @entity10 said any decision would be based on the response of the @entity6 government to the demonstrations			1
" we are watching quite closely to see what those responses are , and the response of the government will determine what that aid looks like , " @entity10 said			2
he repeated @entity23 opposition to any kind of violent crackdown on the protesters , indicating that could be a litmus test for a decision to withhold aid			2
on tuesday , vice president @entity116 spoke by phone with @entity59 to push for more progress , according to a @entity11 statement			0
@entity116 urged " that the transition produce immediate , irreversible progress that responds to the aspirations of the @entity6 people , " according to the @entity11 statement			2
the two vice presidents discussed " restraining the @entity126 's conduct by immediately ending the arrests , harassment , beating and detention of journalists , and political and civil society activists , and by allowing freedom of assembly and expression ; immediately rescinding the emergency law ; broadening participation in the national dialogue to include a wide range of opposition members ; and inviting the opposition as a partner in jointly developing a road map and timetable for transition			0
" " these steps , and a clear policy of no reprisals , are what the broad opposition is calling for and what the government is saying it is prepared to accept , " the statement said			0
" vice president @entity116 expressed the belief that the demands of the broad opposition can be met through meaningful negotiations with the government			0
" also on tuesday , @entity10 made a point of directly criticizing the @entity6 government for continuing detentions , beatings and harassment of journalists and rights activists			2
" the government has got to stop arresting protesters and journalists , harassment , beatings , detentions of reporters , of activists , of those involved in civil society , " @entity10 said			0
previously , he and other @entity23 officials , including @entity3 and secretary of state @entity175 , called for a halt to the crackdown on journalists and activists without directly saying that the @entity6 government was responsible			1
@entity10 also labeled as " particularly unhelpful " the comment by @entity59 in an interview with @entity182 that @entity6 lacks the necessary " culture of democracy " for the changes demanded by protesters , such as freedom of speech and the right to organize opposition parties			2
a senior administration official , speaking with @entity1 on condition of not being identified because of the sensitivity of a rapidly changing political situation in @entity193 , acknowledged tuesday that " there is some sort of level of frustration here			0
" overall , though , the @entity3 administration has been careful to call for democratic reforms in @entity6 while also trying to maintain stability in a key @entity203 ally that is a vital @entity205 partner to @entity206 through the @entity207 of 1978			0
@entity10 repeated the @entity23 call for an orderly transition in @entity6 from the repressive rule of the past three decades under @entity27 to a multiparty democracy through free and fair elections			1
@entity27 has insisted he will remain in power through the end of his term in september instead of ceding to demands for his immediate ouster by the protesters and opposition figures			0
