-- @entity1 wants to be an inspiration			1
as the @entity5 quarterback approaches the second round of the @entity8 playoffs , a documentary offers a detailed look at his quest to convince the teams that he could bring his college success to the pro level			1
with typical humility , he says he just hopes the film inspires young people			0
" i hope it 's a positive message for kids who ( are ) trying to accomplish their dreams , " he told @entity18 's @entity17			1
" i want to show them that there are adversity and obstacles for everyone , but you can make it			0
i am honestly living my dream , but i had adversity and obstacles			0
i want kids to get hope from this			0
" yeah , some of you are rolling your eyes			0
but @entity1 genuinely believes that			1
and that 's one of the messages of the film , says @entity41 , who directed " @entity1 : everything in between			1
" @entity1 is exactly what he appears to be : a hard - working , squeaky - clean , @entity44 guy			1
" it 's really cool to see that it 's true			0
he is who he says he is , " @entity41 said			1
@entity41 is something of an expert on this subject			1
he 's not just a filmmaker who followed the man who is now arguably the most famous quarterback in @entity53			1
he 's also a friend			0
@entity41 's dad and @entity1 's dad were college roommates and have stayed buddies			1
that friendship uniquely positioned the younger @entity41 to ask the @entity60 winner and two - time national champion to be filmed constantly through winter 2010			2
@entity41 and his team at @entity63 , a video production company , ended up with more than 1,000 hours of film , which were edited to 50 minutes when @entity18 picked up the television rights to the project			2
it was shot in the months between @entity1 's last collegiate game and the night he was drafted by the @entity5			1
the film debuted in january 2011 with " very impressive " ratings , @entity18 publicist @entity73 said , and " it has done well in re-airs , too			0
" the documentary will get three more airings before saturday night 's @entity78 game pitting the @entity5 at the heavily favored @entity79			1
the cameras follow @entity1 and his supporters through the process of preparing for the @entity8 draft			1
he hires an agent ; plays in an all - star game for @entity8 prospects ; moves to @entity87 , @entity88 , to train ; and eventually waits in his parents ' home to see which team will choose him			1
@entity92 : @entity1 news , photos and covers more air time is spent on football than personal life , but @entity41 says viewers see what makes @entity1 a special person and athlete			1
people who start out ambivalent about the quarterback or even in the @entity106 camp tell him that , by the end , they 're cheering when the @entity5 call on him			0
" you get to see that none of things he 's gotten in his life are handed to him ; they 're all a byproduct of how hard he works for it , " @entity41 said			1
" i 've never seen someone who is so driven and so focused			0
" in 2010 , @entity1 prepared for the draft as experts debated endlessly where he should go			2
the difference in contract for a top pick and a mid-round pick is millions of dollars			0
but it also sends a statement to the rest of the players about where the team is going			0
in one scene , as @entity1 autographs merchandise with a television within earshot , @entity18 analyst @entity130 tells the tv audience that he thinks @entity1 has third - round talent			2
@entity1 does n't say a word , does n't even lift his head to acknowledge the comment , while others in the room make sympathetic do n't - listen - to - that - guy remarks			2
" it makes him work harder , " @entity41 said			2
" instead of taking it in a negative way , he makes it into something positive			0
" the filmmaker says that 's something he 's seen from @entity1 his whole life , even in high school			1
@entity1 's much - publicized religion is a subtle part of the film			1
he visits a young gunshot victim in the hospital and leads a prayer with the family			0
he speaks at the @entity160 in @entity161			0
he and his mother make a commercial for the conservative religious group , @entity164			0
" i approached this as a documentary , so however @entity1 chose to present his faith that is how we presented it in the piece , " @entity41 said			1
what you see is " how @entity1 lives his life			2
" the recently released dvd has some important extra material , @entity41 says			2
he feels that the tv version of the documentary really does n't leave anything out , but he added some draft night material after getting feedback from fans			2
the tv version goes to black just as @entity8 commissioner @entity185 is about to announce @entity1 's name at the draft			1
@entity41 said he was intrigued by the fact that it seemed women disliked , even hated , cutting it there , while men were cool with the choice			2
there are 10 more minutes of the announcement and ensuing celebration on the dvd			0
he also put some outtakes in which @entity1 's sense of humor is more visible			1
" he likes to rib you a little bit , " he says			0
he even uses humor during the most tense moment of the film , when @entity1 's anxiously deciding with his agent whether to take the risk of going to the @entity8 's draft festivities ( where he 'd be embarrassed if he goes undrafted on the first night )			1
" you have to have a little fun in life , " @entity1 tells him , an easy smile stretching across his face			2
he ended up as the 25th overall pick			0
since the draft , the focus on @entity1 has become steadily more intense			2
@entity41 , now just a friend instead of a documentarian , says he has gone to almost every @entity5 game this year			1
and @entity1 remains the same , he says , thanks in part to the people he surrounds himself with			0
one of the things @entity1 does to stay grounded is to host a child from the @entity225 every week			0
he meets with his guest before each game and take him or her on the field			0
after the contest -- win or lose -- they hang out , talk and cut up			0
you know , to give the kid some hope .			0
