-- after weathering a troublesome roommate situation for a year , @entity1 , 26 , was ready to move out			1
his girlfriend , @entity3 , had the perfect solution : moving in together			1
it 's better to find a new place to live than to move into one person 's established home , says expert			1
" conveniently , an apartment in my four - unit building became available at the very same time , " says @entity10 , 26			0
there are obvious advantages to cohabitation , both emotional ( living with the person you love ) and financial ( sharing expenses like rent )			0
the drawbacks are just as glaring , like adjusting to annoying personal habits and accommodating your loved one 's passion for knickknacks that make your cringe			1
one thing 's for certain , experts say -- the more you discuss before you move in together , the more likely your relationship will succeed			1
@entity1 's and @entity10 's certainly has improved in the year and half they 've lived together			1
" we 're engaged ! " @entity10 says happily			0
the wedding is scheduled for august 26			0
the @entity34 , @entity35 , couple is in good company : according to @entity39 of our unions 2007 , a report by the @entity43 at @entity45 's @entity44 , " over half of all first marriages are now preceded by living together , compared to virtually none 50 years ago			1
" get on the same page but living together does n't guarantee success			1
in fact , about half of all couples that move in together end up separating within five years , according to the @entity54			1
there 's no way to guarantee your relationship wo n't become another statistical failure , of course			1
but there are steps you can take to increase the chances for success			1
before moving in together , discuss the ultimate purpose and how this might affect your relationship -- is it a matter of convenience to provide shelter or financial support , or is it the next step toward marriage ? " are they going to truly commit to each other 's well being on every level ? if not , forget it , " says @entity75 , a marriage and family therapist based in @entity78 , @entity79			1
have a plan to merge possessions coordinate a plan of attack : assess space constraints , sort out what you want and what you need , and get rid of duplicate items			0
natural selection should take place : keep whatever is cleaner , nicer and newer			0
if you 're a pack rat like @entity10 or @entity1 , negotiate space for what 's most important to each of you			0
" he does n't really like to let go of boxed - up old things , and i have more clothes than i could ever hope to wear , " says @entity10			1
" it 's a slightly tenuous cease - fire at the moment			0
we just try our best to keep the open areas clean and clutter - free			0
" the solution , @entity75 says : " discuss a limit on sentimental items before hand , given there will probably be limited space			1
" he advises starting fresh in a brand - new place as opposed to moving into one person 's established space			2
each of you will have your own quirks , so try to respect that			0
" i get sensitive over an unclean bathroom shower ; he gets touchy over a greasy stovetop , " says @entity10			0
" we claim our territory ever so subtly			0
" in addition to being mindful of common space , carve out individual space so you can have some time alone if you wish			0
be meticulous about money it 's not romantic , but take care when buying big - ticket items with your significant other , advises @entity128 , an @entity129 , @entity35 - based attorney and co-author of " @entity131 : a legal guide for @entity133			1
" " if you 're doing any significant purchase or credit where you ca n't afford to just walk away from it if your lover turns out to be a total sociopath , then have a written agreement , " @entity134 says			2
other money matters : if you take out a credit card in your name , use it only for your own expenses			2
if you buy a house together , make sure the title reflects your share of the financial contribution			2
if you decide to open a joint bank account , understand that each person has full access to that money			1
if one partner is financially supporting the other -- helping pay for graduate school , for instance -- there should be " no expectation of payback , no strings attached , " says marriage therapist @entity75			0
" if you do n't feel completely comfortable supporting your loved one , then do n't start			2
" if you separate even if a couple takes all of these steps , there 's still a change that one day they 'll part ways			0
if that happens , cohabitating couples have some of the legal protections of married couples if they meet their state 's definition of common - law spouses or draft written agreements before the split , @entity134 says			2
an agreement does n't have to be drafted by a lawyer to be recognized by a court			2
in about 40 states , an unmarried cohabitant can make a claim based on an oral , written or implied agreement			2
the courts so far have extended the same rights and rules to both heterosexual and homosexual couples , @entity134 says			0
every state has different laws , so if moving in does n't work out , you 'll want to speak with a local lawyer			1
@entity0 provides original and syndicated lifestyle content to web publishers			0
@entity199 is a freelance journalist and relationships editor at the " @entity202			0

expert : more you talk about before moving in together , the better your success
