-- @entity3 scientists briefly pierced the two - mile - thick veil over a freshwater lake hidden beneath @entity7 's ice sheet for millions of years , polar researchers announced wednesday			1
scientists hope samples of @entity10 , a body the size of @entity13 , will yield signs of previously undiscovered life and new clues about the history of the planet			1
the lake is believed to have been covered by ice for up to 30 million years			1
@entity3 researchers completed the drilling effort sunday , reaching the lake at a depth of 3,769 meters ( 2.3 miles ) into the ice , the @entity22 - based @entity21 and @entity23 reported			1
when the ice above the lake was breached , lake water was sucked up into the bore and froze , the @entity3 said			1
that will allow researchers to take samples back to the surface without contaminating the lake below , they said			2
@entity39 geophysicist @entity38 said the @entity7 ice sheet has covered the lake for an estimated 15 million to 30 million years			1
the @entity3 have been trying to reach @entity10 for more than a decade , and the institute said @entity3 natural resources and ecology minister @entity43 was on hand for the final steps			2
" they consider it the equivalent of getting to the moon , " @entity38 told @entity0			0
the lake 's existence was confirmed in 1996			2
earlier drilling by scientists from multiple nations produced ice cores that contain trapped atmospheric gases , which scientists have used to measure changes in the concentration of carbon dioxide over time			2
@entity38 said former vice president @entity60 cited @entity10 ice cores in the 2006 documentary " @entity65 , " about the threat of global climate change			0
and peering into the long - hidden waters could give scientists a glimpse of primordial life forms never before catalogued			0
" every place we 've looked on @entity71 , we 've come up with life , " @entity38 said			0
" so it would be kind of surprising if we did n't find life there			0
" the earlier drillings stopped short of the lake , in part because scientists were n't confident about getting to the water without contaminating it			0
@entity83 oceanography professor @entity82 said areas of those cores that were near the lake -- accreted ice , or ice derived from the lake itself -- contained a few viable bacteria that became active under incubation			0
" there were a very few microorganisms , but in fact there were microorganisms , " said @entity82 , who found them in a half - meter sample of the accreted ice in the late 1990s			0
he said that could mean viable microorganisms exist in the lake			0
it 's also possible nothing is alive there , in part because no sunlight gets to the lake through ice that thick			1
but fossil microorganisms may be found , and microorganisms could be living off other sources of energy , such as geothermal , he said			0
" there also could be living microorganism living off of previously stored energy from sediments , " @entity82 said			0
@entity38 said that to reach the water , the @entity3 drilled to within about 10 meters ( 33 feet ) of the bottom of the ice , then withdrew the drill bit and used a heat probe to bore the rest of the way			1
the effort was designed so that when the ice sheet was breached , lake water was drawn upward a short distance			1
that water quickly froze , closing off the lake and allowing scientists to take samples without introducing any contaminants , @entity38 said			1
" the international community has tried to work collaboratively to try to make sure things are done as safely as possible , and it 's in the @entity3 ' interests to do it right , " she said .			2

new : scientists hope samples will yield previously undiscovered life , clues of planet 's history
@entity3 says its scientists have reached the lake under 2 miles of ice
the lake has been buried beneath a thick sheet of ice for millions of years
