-- golf returns to @entity2 in 2016 after a 112 - year hiatus and some of the greatest names in the sport are battling to put their name to the new course on which the event is to be played			1
18 - time majors winner @entity10 , @entity13 's @entity12 and @entity15 's @entity14 are well past their playing primes but the three legends are among eight finalists in the running to design the 18 - hole course on which the @entity23 golf tournament will be played in @entity24 in four years time			1
@entity26 , @entity27 and @entity25 , @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity31 in the competition to design the course that will be built in the @entity35 area of @entity24 , the part of the city that will host the largest number of @entity23 venues			1
the winner was scheduled to be announced by @entity42 organizers friday			1
in soliciting bids for the course , @entity23 organizers stipulated that it be available as a place for the public to play once the games end			1
" after the @entity42 , the course will be managed by a private operator with the chief purpose of promoting golf in @entity55 and @entity56 , representing one of the most important games ' legacies for sport development in the country , " organizers said			1
for a nation of more than 200 million , @entity55 has about 100 golf courses , many of those only nine holes			0
in contrast , @entity65 has more than four times that many courses with a population that 's just 2 % of @entity55 's			0
@entity10 said the @entity23 course can build golf in @entity55 and across much of the world			1
" i think the @entity2 is the greatest thing that could happen to golf on an international basis , " the @entity73 said in 2010 , because it means governments will support the game by building courses that young people have access to , and some of those young people will turn to golf in search of glory			0
" all the other parts of the world , if you look at the kids when they grow up , they do n't know about the masters or the @entity92 or the @entity93			0
they know about a gold medal			0
and the gold medal is the best you can get in a sport , " @entity10 said			2
" we have one chance for golf as an @entity23 sport to stay in the @entity2			1
... so we 've got to put our best foot forward			0
we 've got to get the best golf course			0
" in an interview with the @entity106 , @entity14 emphasized the big responsibility taken on by whoever gets the @entity24 contract			2
" whoever gets the golf course design job , they have to be the spokesperson for golf in the @entity2 , because golf is only in for 2016			2
it has n't been voted in for 2020			0
" so whoever gets the job has to be beating the drum for the game of golf for the @entity122 for four years after that			0
they have to be a staunch proponent of the game of golf , " @entity14 said			2
and @entity14 echoed @entity10 on the accessibility of the course			1
" it has to be a course built for the general public at the end of the day			0
it ca n't be a private golf club , " @entity14 said			2
on his website , @entity12 said he sees the @entity23 course as an opportunity to grow the game around the world			1
" the @entity2 will expose millions of people in non-traditional golf markets to the game , and that is great for the sport , " @entity12 said			2
" this facility can , and should be , a catalyst for golf in @entity55 long after the @entity23 competition is complete			1
" whichever group wins the @entity23 bid , @entity14 says , they wo n't be doing it to make money			1
organizers will pay $ 300,000 for the course design			0
@entity29 was last an @entity23 event at the 1904 games in @entity158 , with @entity160 's @entity159 winning the gold medal			1
golf was also played at the @entity163 in @entity164			0
there was no women 's competition in golf in those games , but there will be in @entity24			2
when making a pitch to @entity23 organizers to include golf for 2016 , a younger @entity171 star , @entity172 's @entity170 , emphasized what it could mean to kids			1
" for so many boys and girls around the world , their heroes have been @entity23 athletes			0
until today , i never thought there was any chance that i could share in that dream , " @entity170 said .			0
