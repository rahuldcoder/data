@entity0 , @entity1 -- soldiers patrolling the streets , barely - begun construction sites and sewage - soaked waterways			1
the 2016 @entity7 are still two years away , but the list of problems appears to be growing			1
the situation in @entity0 is so dire that the @entity12 vice president @entity11 lashed out in april , calling preparations the " the worst that i have experienced			1
" he had cited several problems , including water quality , social tensions and delayed venues , particularly the @entity18 , the second - biggest venue , where construction has n't even begun			0
he later toned down his comments			0
as @entity1 prepares to welcome hundreds of thousands of international fans to the @entity24 in one week 's time , it has to ensure the world it will also be ready for the @entity7 two years later			1
the delays are exaggerated , says the director of communications for @entity0 's @entity29 , called @entity30			1
" they decided to raise the yellow flag because they were probably scared we would be wasting time watching the @entity24 , " @entity31 told @entity2 in a recent interview			1
" but there is zero risk that the venues wo n't be ready for the @entity7			1
" @entity30 says 38 % of the sites are done , including 11 that are already operational , including the @entity42 which will host the @entity43			1
preparing for 2016 progress at construction sites varies widely			2
out in the beachside suburb of @entity48 , where many of the events will be held , the @entity46 is at an advanced stage , with huge blocks of apartments being erected			0
at the nearby main @entity18 , the foundations have been laid , but construction has n't progressed much further			0
as for @entity56 , where the bmx , whitewater kayaking and rugby events will be held , construction is n't even expected to start until the second half of this year , but @entity31 says they can quickly make up for lost time			0
" @entity56 started late , even you could say more than six months late , but @entity56 is very simple to get organized , " he said			0
" the construction there is very easy			0
" out on @entity67 , the site of @entity7 sailing and windsurfing events , plastic bags and old tennis shoes bob around in the water			1
@entity1 sailing gold medalist @entity73 showed us the garbage boats that remove the flotsam from the area of play			2
" it 's a problem but not for sailing , " he said			0
" it 's a problem for the environment			0
" according to biologist @entity83 , the bigger problem is what you ca n't see			0
" you 're going to put high - performance athletes in this water , that is n't even water , it 's a toilet , " he said during an interview overlooking the @entity87 , which will serve as the base for the @entity7 sailing events			2
the stench of raw sewage wafted as he spoke			0
" i hope authorities do what they promised , because beyond being an environmental and public health problem , it 's a national embarrassment			0
" even the best estimates from city officials say only 49 % of @entity0 homes are connected to sewage lines			1
@entity0 's mayor , @entity106 , says the athletes run no health risks , but admits the promised cleanup wo n't be complete before the @entity7			1
" this is not going to be a problem for the games			0
this is a problem for us , " he said			0
" i always think the @entity7 are a good excuse to get things done and i think we missed an opportunity			2
" tackling crime on the security front , authorities launched a so - called police pacification program back in 2008 aimed at forcing drug gangs out of the notoriously dangerous shantytowns or favelas			0
police have moved into dozens of slums with mixed success			0
while crime rates in the shantytowns have broadly come down , there has been backlash from some residents and a resurgence in crime that prompted authorities to call in the army for help earlier this year , further denting @entity0 's reputation			2
at this point , it 's too early to tell if the @entity7 will face the same kind of widespread protests and discontent leveled at the @entity24			1
according to a recent survey by the @entity146 , 61 % of those interviewed said they think hosting the @entity24 is a bad thing because it takes money away from schools , health care and other public services			1
the @entity7 budget has ballooned to $ 16 billion , but officials say it 's a different story , because private money is largely being used to finance the venues			2
" most of the public money is being spent not on venues , not on fancy stadiums , but on legacy , on transportation , on sewage , " said @entity106 , @entity0 's mayor , pointing to the extensive bus corridors that the city has already begun , that connects venues and isolated areas of the city			2
he 'll have two years to convince @entity1 and the world			1
after the @entity24 ends on july 13 , all eyes will be on @entity0 's @entity7 .			1

as @entity1 readies for @entity24 , issues linger in @entity174 two years away
@entity0 came under *criticism* by @entity12 vice president , but local organizers say the delays are exaggerated
@entity30 says 38 % of the @entity7 sites are done
