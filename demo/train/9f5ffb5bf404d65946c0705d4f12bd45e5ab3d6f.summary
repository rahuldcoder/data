editor 's note : @entity2 is a senior political analyst for @entity3 , appearing regularly on @entity3 's " @entity4 , " " @entity5 , " " @entity6 " and " @entity7 , " as well as special event coverage			1
@entity2 says we could be in for a month of venting sessions aimed at members of @entity12			1
@entity13 ( @entity3 ) -- @entity14 , the summer			2
time for all those members of @entity12 to go home , meet with their constituents , get their input on health care reform and take back what they have learned from the voters			1
in some town hall meetings around the country , anger and fear are trumping any constructive argument -- at least so far			2
recently , for instance , sen. @entity26 held a town hall meeting with @entity29 , the @entity30 secretary			2
in attempting to answer questions , they were shouted down by folks more interested in venting than discussing			1
on the conservative @entity37 web site , the display was headlined " @entity26 gets schooled			2
" above the video of the event , the site says " ... this is a must watch and a must emulate at town halls across the country over the next month			2
" really ? what about those folks who are actually interested in debating and discussing a very complex issue they 're trying to digest ? there are some who may actually want to figure out the best way to solve the health care problem			1
what ever happened to asking questions about the quality of care , the cost of insurance , the impact of any public plan on the health care system ? after all , this has been a turbulent economic time for this country , and another huge shock to the system is naturally worrisome			1
especially when it comes to an issue as complex as health care			1
but it 's not just the folks at these town halls who have learned how to heckle			2
their bad behavior is a derivative of the questionable quality of the political debate they listen to every day			2
indeed , if there 's one thing we 've gotten really good at over the years , it 's this : reducing complicated problems to bite - sized slogans			1
it seems to work , so we keep doing it			0
@entity85 , @entity84 's reform ideas become " socialism " to his @entity88 critics			0
and the administration is not above creating a handy bogeyman of its own : the insurance companies			0
at least according to house speaker @entity93 , who accuses them of " full - force carpet - bombing and shock and awe against the public option			0
" too bad they actually support the rest of reform , and are still running positive ads about the effort			0
they were n't at the table at all 16 years ago when @entity106 's effort at reform failed			0
the world has changed since then , and the congressional plans for reforming health care have changed , too			1
but the invective of the debate , sad to say , has not			0
the effort on @entity114 has been serious			0
i hate to sound like @entity116 , but members of @entity12 are actually doing some real work			1
some policy differences may never get resolved because they are too ideological ; others are regional , and that 's tough , too			1
but they 're working at it , for hours on end , behind closed doors			0
no cameras , no grandstanding			0
one of those working the hardest , @entity128 sen. @entity128 of @entity129 , was derided at a town hall recently on the matter of his own health insurance			1
so here 's the fellow who is spending every waking hour trying to get a bipartisan measure that can pass the @entity138 -- and be fair to @entity139 -- and he goes home and gets an earful			0
maybe the discourse will become more productive as the summer progresses			0
but the health care dilemma remains , no matter how loud the discussion			1
as @entity145 told us , " to govern is to choose			0
" especially when the choices are not easy			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			1

@entity2 : congressional recess provides chance for health care discussion
she says some *people* more interested in shouting than serious talk
she says @entity12 is *grappling* with a tough , complex issue
@entity2 : stop reducing complicated issues to *simplistic* sound bites
