-- the impeachment of @entity3 science minister @entity2 last month was just the latest episode in an ongoing struggle between so - called moderates and hard - liners that has been going on in the country since the 1979 revolution			1
it 's a bad sign for those pinning their hopes on the ability of president @entity16 to bring about change in @entity3			1
tensions between reformists and conservatives have never quite brought the @entity21 to a breaking point , but they have been the source of economic malaise and internal instability			2
unfortunately , as tempting as it has been to view @entity16 's election last year as a solution to @entity3 's endemic political battles , his presidency is actually likely to perpetuate -- if not increase -- the dysfunction within the @entity3 regime			1
indeed , even a possible nuclear deal -- which itself is far from certain at this point -- is unlikely to be enough to provide @entity16 with a decisive political victory			1
instead , it might simply dredge up the angst and anxiety that culminated in the @entity42 in 2009			0
hard - line parliamentarians managed to muster the numbers to impeach @entity2 for his supposedly " un-revolutionary " educational policies , specifically his welcoming back of students and faculty associated with what hardline conservatives deem to be the " seditious " @entity51 uprising			0
the previous government , under president @entity54 , had purged the universities of reformist elements and introduced an atmosphere into academia reminiscent of the early revolutionary years , and while @entity16 has n't enacted any major reforms since his election , higher education reform was seen as a first move in delivering on his campaign promises			2
hard - liners have generally been critical of @entity16 's nuclear negotiations , but are believed to have been restrained in their attacks on the urging of @entity69 ayatollah @entity68 -- while conservatives do n't wish to empower @entity16 , they are also conscious of @entity3 's precarious economic situation and are therefore reluctant to block @entity16 's diplomatic efforts , for now at least			1
but they are loathe to give @entity16 freedom of movement on domestic issues			1
for them , the " sedition " of 2009 was a direct challenge to the @entity21 as a whole			0
and while @entity16 condemned the 2009 uprising , he has nevertheless maintained working relations with key reformist figures such as former president @entity85			0
yet , although a large constituency for change exists throughout @entity3 society , represented by regime reformists and centrists like @entity16 as well as secular , nationalist and leftist opposition groups vigorously oppressed by the regime , it is still unclear what could actually prompt change in @entity3			2
after all , @entity3 are well aware of the @entity97 burning before them			2
but their country , while divided and dysfunctional , is at least relatively secure and stable			0
and while @entity16 suggests the possibility of political evolution , the failure of the reform / centrist movement in achieving meaningful change is also obvious			0
the reality for @entity3 is that neither revolution nor evolution might be feasible for @entity3			2
so what is left ? the eventual passing of @entity68 might one day provide an opportunity for change , but even then , the chances of a succession remaining cordial or even peaceful are hardly guaranteed , especially given the current environment of political animosity			0
@entity3 's competing factions see an uncertain future as they seek to position themselves for the @entity118 era , including @entity16 's ally and patron , former president ayatollah @entity121 , who is reportedly keen to reclaim the chairmanship of the assembly of experts , a clerical body with the power to appoint the next supreme leader			1
however , it is difficult to imagine conservatives accepting @entity121 or @entity16 being left in a position to shape the succession to @entity132 , as this could open the door to meaningful reforms -- and ( at least as far as conservatives are concerned ) the end of the @entity21 in its current form			0
all this suggests that @entity2 's impeachment is very likely a sign of some troubling times to come			0
and even though @entity16 offers the @entity145 's best hope of the nuclear issue being addressed , a deal could very well energize the president 's rivals in their bid to stave off change .			1

@entity152 , former @entity3 science minister , was impeached last month
move was latest sign of internal power struggle in @entity3 , says @entity157
he argues @entity3 's conservatives are unlikely to give ground on domestic issues
@entity157 says a nuclear deal might actually energize president 's rivals
