@entity2 's campaign released an ad accusing the @entity26 of voting against legislation that would help prepare the @entity28 for a pandemic situation such as the ebola virus , while @entity0 has charged that @entity2 is soft on illegal immigration			1
@entity32 : key 2014 @entity9 races the poll shows that each candidate is winning his party 's traditional political voting blocs , except @entity0 appears strong with a key subset of the @entity40 's most faithful supporters -- a data point that is likely to raise a red flag among party elders and strategists			1
while @entity2 holds an 8 - point advantage over @entity0 with likely women voters overall , @entity0 is favored by likely voters among white women by 11 points			1
losing a key constituency to an opponent by such a large margin could be devastating			0
" the bad news is that he seems to have opened up a new way to lose to @entity58 by losing badly with white women , " said a @entity3 operative who knows @entity2 but is not working on his race			1
" the good news is that is a segment of the electorate that tends to break @entity3 , and he has time to close that gap			2
if he does , he wins			0
" @entity3 boost @entity64 in @entity65 after controversial ad for @entity0 , one of his biggest weaknesses is with people who make under $ 50,000 -- not unexpected when you look at traditional political voting bloc alliances			1
@entity2 has a 9 - point lead over @entity0 with this group			1
the recent decision to include a measure on the november ballot that would increase the minimum wage in @entity10 from $ 6.25 to $ 8.50 by 2017 may help the incumbent by turning out more @entity3 base voters , who often sit out midterm elections			1
" the hope in @entity3 circles is that those lower - income voters will turn out to vote themselves a raise , and while they are in the voting booth , they will wind up casting a ballot for @entity2 as well , " @entity6 polling director @entity82 said			1
when it was announced that the measure would be on the ballot , @entity2 issued a statement calling it a " common sense proposal to put more money in the pockets of hardworking families across @entity10			1

while @entity2 voted for health care reform , he has opposed the president on other issues in the @entity9 and has not embraced him on the campaign trail			2
@entity9 election in @entity107 is marquee race for some @entity58 , though , it is puzzling that @entity0 does n't have a bigger lead over @entity2			1
while @entity2 is among the centrists in his party and is the son of a former governor , if you look at the most recent voting trends , they would seem to clearly favor the @entity26			2
cases in point : @entity118 beat @entity96 by 24 points in 2012 , and four years earlier , @entity120 carried the state by 20 points			0
in 2010 , @entity2 's then - @entity3 colleague , sen. @entity123 , lost her seat to @entity58 rep. @entity125 by 21 points			1

he deployed to @entity130 and @entity131 , is @entity132 educated and hails from a longtime @entity10 family			0
yet , there is a thought among some @entity58 that @entity0 has failed to connect personally with voters			2

@entity2 is a likable guy			0
@entity0 's got to turn on the charm in the closing weeks			0
" in the so - called middle , @entity0 is winning independent voters by 20 points , but it is unclear how nonpartisan these voters may be			0
a closer look at the data suggests that these voters appear to be more conservative - leaning than liberal - leaning			0
@entity158 forecast : @entity58 jitters in @entity159 " in some states , tea party supporters in recent years have tended to describe themselves as independents rather than @entity58 since they do n't feel comfortable with the @entity58 as it is currently structured , " @entity82 said			0
" it 's unclear if this is true in @entity10 , but one piece of evidence to support it is that more than half of self - described independents say they are conservative and only eight percent call themselves liberal			0
" in the end , the winner of this race will be the person who turns out more of its supporters , while at the same time convincing crossover voters to support their campaign			0
the poll shows that @entity2 has an edge in this category as 9 % of @entity58 said they are backing or leaning towards voting for him , while 5 % of @entity3 said they are backing or leaning toward @entity0			1
