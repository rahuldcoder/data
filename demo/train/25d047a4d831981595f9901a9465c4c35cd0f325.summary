-- @entity1 and @entity2 may play totally inept undercover cops in " @entity4 , " but at the box office , they 're proving much more effective			2
the r - rated comedy scored a tremendous $ 35 million in its opening weekend , enough to easily top the chart			1
" @entity4 " opened in the same range as films like " bad teacher " ( $ 31.6 million ) , " @entity17 " ( $ 33.1 million ) , " @entity18 " ( $ 33.9 million ) , and " @entity19 " ( $ 42.3 million ) , but each of those films opened in the summer , when @entity9 - rated fare like " @entity11 " and " bridesmaids " has traditionally captured raunch - loving audiences			1
for " @entity4 " to earn $ 35 million over a weekend in mid-march is a far more impressive achievement			1
indeed , only one r - rated comedy has ever debuted to higher numbers outside the summer season : " @entity26 , " which started with $ 50.4 million in october 2010			2
" @entity4 " also opened higher than fellow tv adaptations " @entity28 " ( $ 28.1 million ) , " @entity29 " ( $ 30.7 million ) , and " @entity30 " ( $ 25.7 million )			1
the strong debut marks a return - to - form for star @entity2 , whose live - action comedic catalog seemed less impressive after unremarkable box office performances from " @entity36 " ( $ 30.4 million total ) and " @entity37 " ( $ 61 million ) , and a slew of more dramatic roles in " @entity40 , " " @entity41 , " and " @entity42			0
" " @entity4 " finally delivered on the expectations set up by @entity2 's breakout role in " @entity17 , " which earned $ 121.5 million total in 2007			1
@entity1 , meanwhile , scored his second straight hit after " @entity47 , " which has a running total of $ 121.1 million			2
these numbers bode well for his next two releases , " @entity51 : retaliation " and " @entity52 , " both out in june			0
@entity53 and @entity54 , who have a potential juggernaut franchise on their hands , spent a sensible $ 42 million on " @entity4 , " which earned a " b " cinemascore grade from polled audiences			1
in second place , @entity61 's smash animated hit " @entity63 " dipped 41 percent in its third weekend to $ 22.8 million			1
after 17 days , the 3d film has found an impressive $ 158.4 million , already more than the last dr @entity66 adaptation , " @entity68 , " which grossed $ 154.5 million total in 2008			0
also impressive is the film 's per theater average , which remains a robust $ 6,049 , even in its third weekend @entity26 ticket prices are certainly helping )			0
considering " @entity63 , " which cost $ 70 million to produce , is headed for a final domestic gross right around $ 200 million , it 's no surprise that @entity61 and @entity74 are now getting to work on an animated version of " @entity76			2
" @entity78 's expensive misfire " @entity79 " dropped by 55 percent in its sophomore frame to third place and $ 13.5 million			1
the $ 250 million project has now earned $ 53.2 million after ten days , and if it continues to play like a frontloaded fanboy flick ( and it will ) , it will finish its run around $ 80 million			0
international receipts will need to be utterly gargantuan to save the @entity87 adaptation -- it 's taken in $ 126.1 million overseas so far			0
" @entity90 " and " a @entity91 " came in fourth and fifth place , respectively			0
" @entity90 " fell 64 percent to $ 4 million , giving the party flick a total of $ 48.1 million against a $ 15 million budget			2
@entity97 's " a @entity91 " dropped by a slim 39 percent to $ 3.8 million , for a two - weekend total of $ 12.1 million			1
the $ 40 million comedy will join the ranks of " @entity100 " ( $ 16.1 million ) and " @entity101 " ( $ 11.8 million ) as major @entity97 bombs			0
over on the limited release front , @entity109 comedy " @entity108 " proved to be the most caliente smaller title , drawing in $ 2.2 million from just 382 locations , enough for a sturdy per theater average of $ 5,759			0
" @entity111 , " meanwhile dipped by 26 percent to $ 1.5 million despite expanding from 369 to 641 theaters			2
@entity120 / @entity119 collaboration " @entity118 " proved less appealing , earning $ 840,000 from 254 theaters , though that was way better than @entity115 thriller " @entity116 , " which found $ 260,000 from 231 theaters			0
perhaps a direct - to - dvd run would have been a better option			0
" @entity4 " -- $ 35.0 million 2			2
" @entity63 " -- $ 22.8 mil 3			1
" @entity79 " -- $ 13.5 mil 4			1
" @entity90 " -- $ 4.0 mil 5			0
" a @entity91 " -- $ 3.8 mil next weekend , a little movie called " @entity125 " is coming out , and with some of the best tracking numbers ever seen a week before release , the hugely anticipated adaptation will likely score one of the best opening weekend 's of the year -- maybe ever			1
