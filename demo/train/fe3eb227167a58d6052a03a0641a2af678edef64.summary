among the calls for justice in the @entity3 , @entity4 , rape case is one from a familiar @entity8 mask - wearing face			1
@entity15 , the activist hacking collective that has instigated cyberattacks on such groups as the @entity13 and the @entity14 , made a statement tuesday regarding the case of @entity18 , the high schooler who says she was raped by a local football player			1
the 2012 case is back in the news after a recent investigative report by the @entity25 raised questions about the way it was handled			0
" we demand an immediate investigation into the handling by local authorities of @entity18 's case , " @entity15 said			1
" we have heard @entity18 's story far too often			0
we heard it from @entity35 , @entity36 and @entity37			0
... if @entity3 wo n't defend these young girls , if the police are too cowardly or corrupt to do their jobs , if justice system has abandoned them , then we will have to stand for them			1
" the statement closed with @entity15 ' traditional tagline : " we are @entity15			1
" @entity4 prosecutor to seek special prosecutor in teen rape case a rape case may seem like a strange cause for @entity15 , which is better known for defending @entity53 freedoms			1
but it 's not the first time the group has gotten involved in high - profile episodes of of bullying or sexual assault			1
last year , it posted information about the reputed tormenter of @entity63 , the @entity65 girl who committed suicide in 2012 after a topless photo of her led to teasing and abuse at school			0
@entity15 also threatened to reveal names of students involved in the 2012 @entity35 , @entity74 , rape case involving a high school girl who was sexually assaulted by two high school football players			1
witnesses to the crime talked about the incident on social media sites , sharing photographs and using degrading terms for the victim			0
@entity84 reached out to @entity15 for comment via a @entity87 site affiliated with the collective but did not immediately receive a reply			1
the group sees itself as a defender of the defenseless			0
it was also active in spreading the word of the @entity95 and making trouble for opponents			0
who is @entity15 ? everyone and no one " @entity15 likens itself to the @entity103 of the @entity95 , " @entity84 's @entity101 reported in 2012			2
" when they see evidence of what they believe is police misbehavior , @entity15 strikes back , releasing personal information about specific officers			2
" @entity110 , a professor at @entity111 in @entity112 who 's written extensively on @entity15 , says the group has gotten involved with rape cases only recently			1
" historically , @entity15 tended to get involved in censorship and social movements , " she said			2
" but because they have no mandates , there have been operations relating to any and every cause			0
if there 's one that becomes particularly powerful -- and i would say that 's what happened with @entity35 -- then it does become part of the repertoire of injustices they get involved in			2
" if there 's a particular perceived injustice , the group is more driven to get involved , @entity131 says			1
in the @entity3 case , authorities dropped the charges against the athletes who had been implicated in the alleged rape			2
but , @entity131 adds , there 's also a bit of chance involved			2
she said @entity15 picked up on the @entity3 case after a @entity87 message was sent to an account affiliated with the group			1
it read , " this is what happens when @entity15 does n't get involved in a rape case , " with a link to the @entity25 story			1
the fact that the case was essentially closed may have prodded the collective , she adds			0
" basically , it 's case closed , " she said			0
" if it was an ongoing case , they would still maybe get involved , but it attracts more attention in a situation like this			0
there are still a lot of questions			0
" @entity3 is the third rape case @entity15 has been part of in a year , she observes			1
though @entity15 originated out of the website 4chan and initially took on activities for thrills , its focus has changed in the past few years , says @entity131			0
now , operations tend to be politically motivated -- and there 's even some backbiting if things get out of hand			0
for example , people involved in the @entity3 project have been critical of the @entity35 operation " because there was so much collateral damage , " @entity131 said			0
" they do learn from previous operations , " she said , though the nature of @entity15 is that its activities remain fluid			0
it 's difficult to know whether @entity15 ' demands have had any impact on the @entity3 case			1
but @entity4 lt. gov. @entity194 on tuesday called for a grand jury review of the evidence .			2
