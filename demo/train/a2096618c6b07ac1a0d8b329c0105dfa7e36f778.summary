@entity0 -- president @entity2 will sign into law wednesday the @entity5 reform bill -- the most - sweeping set of changes to @entity9 's financial regulatory system since the 1930s			1
the legislation will vastly reform the way big financial firms do business			1
this is " reform that will prevent the kind of shadowy deals that led to this crisis , reform that would never again put taxpayers on the hook for @entity5 's mistakes , " the president said last week			1
the bill aims to strengthen consumer protection , rein in complex financial products and head off more bank bailouts			1
the @entity28 approved the reforms thursday on a 60 to 39 vote , ending more than a year - long effort to pass legislation in response to the 2008 financial crisis			1
to secure enough votes , @entity35 made lots of deals , which watered down the bill			2
for example , @entity5 banks will get wiggle room to make limited risky bets , which is tougher than the current law , but weaker than earlier drafts			2
the legislation would establish a @entity47 inside the @entity48 that could write new rules to protect consumers from unfair or abusive practices in mortgages and credit cards			0
the bill creates a new council of regulators , lead by the @entity58 , that would set new standards for how much cash banks must keep on hand to prevent them from triggering a financial crisis			0
it would also establish new procedures for shutting down giant financial firms that are collapsing			0
the measure would put new limits on @entity5 banks ' speculative bets for their own accounts and their ability to own hedge funds , while leaving the door open for some investment activities			2
the bill aims to shine a brighter light on some complex financial products , called derivatives , that are blamed for exacerbating the collapse of financial companies such as @entity82 and @entity83			1
it would force most derivatives onto clearinghouses and exchanges , to better pinpoint the value of the trades			0
and it would insert a middleman between trades , so that financial firms are less interconnected , to prevent the domino effect of financial firm failures in 2008			0
" we made a promise in the fall of ' 08 that we 'd do everything in our power to see to it we 'd never again put the @entity9 public in the position we were in september and early october 2008 , " sen. @entity96 , @entity97 , said after the @entity28 vote			0
" and we have fulfilled that promise with this legislation			0
" republicans objected to some of the bill 's major provisions , particularly parts that establish the consumer agency and create new rules for the derivatives			2
while they generally favored more consumer protection and more regulation of derivatives , they argued that the legislation is too heavy - handed in these areas			1
they also object to the fact that the bill virtually ignores the increasingly insolvent government - owned mortgage giants @entity126 and @entity127 , beyond studying their problems			0
" [ this bill ] is widely expected to stifle growth and kill jobs , " said @entity28 minority leader @entity130 , @entity131			0
in fact , @entity136 minority leader @entity135 , @entity137 , called for the repeal of the reform bill hours before the @entity28 even passed it			1
yet @entity144 @entity143 sens. @entity142 and @entity145 , as well as @entity147 sen. @entity146 voted for the bill , joining 57 @entity35 to limit debate and move forward			0
one @entity150 , sen. @entity151 of @entity152 opposes the bill , saying it is n't aggressive enough against @entity5 .			1
