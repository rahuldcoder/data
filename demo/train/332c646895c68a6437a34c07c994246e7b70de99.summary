@entity0 -- additional details surfaced thursday pointing to similarities between the bombs found in packages mailed from @entity6 last week and a failed attempt to blow up a plane as it landed in @entity9 , @entity10 , last year			1
investigators have found syringes associated with the explosives found last week , a @entity12 official said			1
@entity17 agents investigating the failed attack on the plane landing in @entity9 on december 25 found what appeared to be the remnants of a syringe			1
they made the discovery near the seat of @entity25 , a 25 - year - old @entity26 citizen who faces charges including attempted murder			2
investigators say he tried to blow up a plane with an explosive that was partly sewn into his underwear			2
experts have said that the bomber probably used a liquid in a syringe with a chemical he was carrying ; that would have created a fire and ignited the explosives			2
it is the latest connection to be found between both incidents			2
@entity45 , a powerful explosive , was used in the parcel bomb plot and last year 's foiled bombing			1
and officials believe that @entity49 was responsible for both plots			2
" this was @entity49 , " the @entity12 official said thursday			2
" the body of information that people have reviewed over the past several days points very directly to @entity49			2
" @entity49 has shown a strong interest , and regrettably skill , in dealing with @entity45 , but that would n't be the only reason why this government would reach the conclusion that they are responsible			0
there is other information , too			0
" homeland security secretary @entity63 recently said the two devices found on freight planes in the @entity66 and the @entity67 last week have " all the hallmarks " of a plot by @entity49 , the @entity6 - based arm of the terrorist network			1
the same group also claimed responsibility for the december bombing attempt			1
the most recent security threat came to light friday , when authorities in the @entity66 and @entity67 found two packages sent from @entity6 with explosives that were addressed to synagogues in @entity81 , @entity82			1
the devices were packed in computer printer toner cartridges and designed to be detonated by a cell phone , a source close to the investigation said			0
the detonating substance was lead azide , a " very powerful initiator " that is easily prepared and is a standard substance in detonations , a source closely involved in the investigation said			0
the @entity12 official said that testing on the devices is ongoing , but the assumption at this point is that the lead azide in the syringe was supposed to be an improvised blasting cap			0
when the circuit was completed , a wire in the syringe would heat up and ignite the lead azide , the official said			0
that would set off the @entity45			0
one of the parcel bombs was disarmed minutes before it was due to explode , @entity107 interior minister @entity106 told @entity107 tv on thursday in @entity111			0
" one parcel has been defused , one of the parcel bombs , was defused only 17 minutes before the time of the blast , " @entity112 said on @entity113			0
the @entity119 and other @entity12 officials are not confirming the @entity107 minister 's assertion			1
@entity123 , the @entity119 press secretary , said thursday that @entity67 and @entity66 investigators have the packages			1
" the investigators are looking into all features of the investigation , " @entity123 said			0
" obviously , since those were to be loaded on @entity12 carriers , the @entity17 is deeply involved			0
" the forensics are very tedious , meticulous			0
... we have confidence in that investigation , and when it 's concluded , we 'll look forward to that investigation being made public ... but i have no information to confirm that fact			1
" investigators in @entity6 say they suspect that @entity139 , @entity49 's top bomb maker in the region , is behind the explosive devices sent in the parcels			1
@entity12 authorities are said to be also looking at @entity139 because @entity45 was used in the parcels and by the underwear bomber			0
@entity1 's @entity147 , @entity148 and @entity149 contributed to this report .			1

@entity153 's @entity6 wing is suspected in last week 's bomb plot
ties are seen to the *christmas* day bombing attempt
investigations are being carried out in @entity67 and the @entity66
