@entity2 @entity1 's decision to pass on 2016 anoints @entity4 as the clear establishment favorite in the @entity7 presidential race and lays down a challenge to the party 's divided conservatives			1
though the first contests will not take place in early voting states for a year , @entity1 's swerve , announced on a conference call with supporters on friday , is the most important moment yet in the nascent @entity7 contest			1
it removes the prospect of a bruising battle for big establishment donor cash and moderate , right of center , @entity7 primary voters between @entity1 , the 2012 nominee and @entity4 , heir to a dynastic political machine			1
" i think it is hard to argue that today 's news did not help gov. @entity4 , " said @entity27 , chairman of the @entity7 in @entity28 , which holds one of the crucial early voting primaries next year			1
@entity4 sent the @entity7 race into overdrive with his sudden announcement last month that he was actively exploring a run for president			1
since then , he has been flying around the nation in an apparent bid to put up a formidable " shock and awe " early fundraising number to define the contest in his favor			0
though @entity4 is seen as leading establishment @entity7 , @entity1 's decision could improve @entity48 gov. @entity47 's hopes of financing a long campaign			1
" today 's news certainly does re-open the fight for donors			0
i know many donors had been frozen in recent weeks , taking a ' wait and see ' approach , " said @entity27			0
" there 's a finite amount of money that can be raised -- so every candidate benefits			0
" @entity58 , a one - time adviser to @entity1 who is now a @entity3 commentator , said his former boss 's decision opened up an early trial of strength between @entity47 and @entity4			1
" this becomes the first big test between those candidates , which one of them can quickly move to lock down those donors			0
it is a very successful , very large fundraising network			0
it 's going to be an important asset			0
" some party insiders also believe conservative candidates who can also straddle the line with the establishment could benefit from @entity1 's departure			1
a top adviser to one potential @entity7 primary contender said in an interview that @entity1 's exit likely helps both @entity81 sen. @entity80 and @entity83 gov. @entity82 , who both have strong conservative support but have also been warmly received by some establishment - minded donors			1
" they 're acceptable to the establishment but they also have support within the various conservative bases — among economic conservatives , social conservatives and national security conservatives , " the adviser said			0
@entity1 's decision not to run does n't remove him from the 2016 calculus entirely — it sets him up to be a potential kingmaker in one of the most wide - open primary fields in recent memory			1
though sources told @entity3 's @entity101 not to expect a @entity1 endorsement of another candidate in the near future , contenders will be clamoring for his blessing			1
a top @entity80 aide said " any leading candidate would " want @entity1 's support			1
@entity109 , @entity1 's top strategist in @entity110 , said that his " guess is [ @entity1 ] probably will " endorse a candidate in the primary			2
@entity1 's statement , however , made clear that he was not stepping aside in favor of @entity4			1
in fact he appeared to take a veiled swipe at the 61 - year - old former @entity81 governor			0
" i believe that one of our next generation of @entity7 leaders , one who may not be as well known as i am today , one who has not yet taken their message across the country , one who is just getting started , may well emerge as being better able to defeat the @entity128 nominee , " @entity1 told his supporters			1
he appeared to be implying that the @entity7 would be best served by a younger candidate taking on @entity130 , who will be 69 at the time of the general election in november 2016			2
@entity80 , 43 , quickly picked up on the idea of a generational shift , stressing repeatedly in a short statement praising @entity1 that he was close to the 2012 nominee			2
" he certainly earned the right to consider running , so i deeply respect his decision to give the next generation a chance to lead			2
" @entity82 , 47 , also picked up the signals , thanking @entity1 in a tweet for " opening the door for fresh leadership in @entity145			2
" @entity1 may also be making a point by sitting down for dinner on friday night with @entity47 , 52 , in @entity148			1
his exit will also shift the terrain more practically in the early states , where his former staffers can now join the campaign of their choice			0
@entity109 said he 's been receiving calls from former @entity1 operatives in the state — and interested candidates — wondering what 's next , but he was n't yet leaning toward any candidate in particular			2
" [ @entity1 's ] not gon na be a candidate , so that means we are open for business , " @entity109 said			2
reverberations are also being felt in @entity166 , where voters will get the 2016 ball rolling next year and where @entity1 lost by only a handful of votes to @entity171 on the way to the @entity7 nomination in 2012			1
a @entity176 / @entity175 poll published friday showed 57 percent of likely caucus goers had favorable feelings about @entity1			2
but that figure was down from 65 percent in october			0
@entity1 may have calculated that he would have struggled to keep that level of support , fighting @entity4 and @entity47 for moderates and facing fresh faced conservatives like @entity82 and firebrand sen. @entity184			1
" there a lot of people who had second thoughts about @entity1 , " said @entity185 , an @entity186 professor who is an authority on the state 's fabled caucuses			2
" @entity1 would have had a much harder time in @entity166 , " in 2016 , @entity185 said			2
@entity4 is basking in a second straight day of good news			0
on thursday , he poached @entity196 , one of the state 's most highly regarded political consultants for a possible post running his campaign			0
@entity196 previously worked for @entity1 in @entity166 , and his departure was seen as a serious blow to the former @entity204 governor			0
the narrowing of the establishment field may hold a wake up call for conservatives who hoped a candidate preferred by the grass roots would emerge this cycle			0
but with candidates like @entity82 , @entity184 , @entity214 , @entity171 and @entity216 sen. @entity215 all tipped to appeal to certain sections of the conservative electorate , they face a familiar problem : the lack of a single right - wing favorite to take on the establishment 's pick			0
@entity1 's announcement , which kept political pundits guessing until minutes before he spoke with supporters , was in keeping with the already rich drama of the 2016 race			0
even a month ago , no one thought that @entity1 , who twice ran for president and lost , could find a rationale to underpin another shot			0
but in three frenzied weeks , @entity1 , apparently disdaining the quality of the crowded @entity7 race , and bumped into a swift decision by @entity4 's early move , appeared to be about to jump in			1
@entity4 had previously effectively forced out another possible establishment candidate sen. @entity237 , by getting into the race			1
@entity1 traveled to @entity239 to headline the @entity242 's winter meeting , and stoked speculation by consulting former staffers and party heavyweights about a possible run			0
for now , most of those close to @entity1 believe he will resume his role as the de-facto leader of the party until a nominee emerges , speaking out on key issues			1
" you 'll see him do what he 's already been doing post- 2012 — be someone that stands up to president @entity258 , speaks the truth when the opportunity calls , " @entity109 said			0
@entity3 's @entity261 contributed to this story			0
