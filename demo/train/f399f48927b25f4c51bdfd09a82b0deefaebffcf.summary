-- for nearly two decades , @entity1 has been one of the busiest actors in @entity3			0
not only has he lent his voice to " @entity5 " each season as @entity7 , but he 's also the creator and voices behind @entity10 's stop - motion animation show , " @entity11 , " which is slated for a seventh season later this year			1
he 's not slowing down anytime soon			1
this week , he can be seen co-starring in the new indie drama " @entity21 , " which opens in select theaters nationwide and on video on demand , as well as in the film " @entity20 , " which hits video on - demand today			1
it was also recently announced that @entity1 will star in " dads , " @entity25 's forthcoming live - action comedy on @entity26			1
@entity0 recently spoke with @entity1 about @entity3 's digital revolution , nostalgic television and if we can ever expect to see that rumored @entity31 sequel			1
@entity0 : " @entity21 " centers around a guy with autism who 's trying to get a job and get a girl			1
what 's been your connection to autism before this film ? @entity1 : i do n't know that i 've had too much of a personal connection			1
i 've met autistic people and i 've seen the different ways @entity3 has portrayed them over the years			0
" @entity21 " is based on an amalgam of characters that ( writer / director ) @entity47 met			0
he wanted to tell a story from the inside of a character who was unaware of something that 's different about them			1
@entity56 knows he 's special because he 's told he 's special but he does n't understand that there 's limitations to what he can aspire towards			1
my character is the opposite of that			0
he 's someone on the autistic spectrum who 's consistently been told that he 's only there to serve as guilt and empathy for anyone that 's neurologically typical			1
so he 's become bitter and isolated			1
@entity0 : in the last 10 years , you 've embraced many different media in getting your work out there			0
your new film , " @entity20 , " is being released on video on demand and @entity77			1
is @entity3 dragging their feet in terms of getting content to fans ? is this something you think about ? green : i think about all of that stuff			1
it 's just evolution and the more you try to keep something as you predict it , the faster it will slip away from you			1
we 're in a day and age where anyone under 20 does n't even understand the concept of " convergence of media " because it 's already converged			1
to most teenagers or people under 25 , the portal to which they watch their content is inconsequential			1
whether it 's a phone or a tablet or a tv or a movie theater , it 's really about the content			1
i look for the best ways to reach the right audience for whatever project it is			0
most of all , i concentrate on making the content as good as it can be			2
that way no matter where or when or how someone is watching it , they 're still offered the same experience			0
i 'm sure people felt the same way about the steam engine			0
" why are we building all these railroads ? " we 're kind of arrogant enough to believe that where we are is the pinnacle of evolution and that there are n't going to be massive cultural changes			0
my goal is to make content for the rest of my life and career			2
to that end , it 's just about being smart and staying current			2
@entity0 : it was recently announced that you 're starring in " dads , " @entity25 's live action sitcom			1
what can you tell us about the show ? green : the show is about two lifelong friends who started a successful video game company			0
one of them is married with kids and their father lives with them			0
the other best friend , me , is sort of this serial dater , perpetually breaking up with people			0
his father left when he was very young and now through circumstance , his father moves in with him , too			0
you have these two lifelong best friends , living with their dads , who one way or another , have failed to take care of themselves			0
@entity162 is my dad and @entity163 is @entity164 's dad			2
my character is a miserable guy who has n't figured out how to make himself happy			0
he wakes up every day hating himself			0
it 's going to be a really funny thing to play			2
especially with a character like that , trying to humanize him or even ( make him ) sympathetic -- that 's going to be a fun challenge			2
@entity0 : is it raunchy like " @entity5 " can be ? green : it 's a multicamera show			2
@entity177 ( @entity178 ) and @entity179 ( @entity180 ) , the guys who wrote it , have been talking about " @entity181 , " @entity182 " and " @entity183			0
" shows like that , where all the characters are grounded in reality , where there 's a lot of emotional potential , but funny because it 's about real life			2
that 's what we 're all aiming to do : use this medium in a provocative way , the way the shows we grew up on did			2
@entity0 : rumors have floated around for a while about an " @entity31 4 " film			2
is there any traction around that ? green : you know , i 've been hearing rumors about " @entity31 4 " and " @entity208 " since " @entity209 " and " @entity210 " came out			0
i ca n't speak for people making plans without including me , but i will say , i have not heard any confirmable opinions in either direction .			0

the actor has a new indie film coming out
he says *entertainment* is more about the content than how it 's delivered
