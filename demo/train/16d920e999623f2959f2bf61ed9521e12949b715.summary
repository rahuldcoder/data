there is something mirage - like about @entity3 's capital @entity4			1
@entity5 surrounds the city for 1,200 kilometers , save a handful of provincial towns dotted across the world 's largest steppe , a flat , empty expanse of grassland			2
shooting up from this void is a mass of strangely futuristic structures			2
the newest of these is the @entity19 - designed @entity18 , a shopping mall that doubles as the world 's largest tent			2
@entity19 was also the architect behind the @entity23 , a 60 - meter - tall glass pyramid			2
there 's also the @entity26 , which from above looks like a budding flower , a flying saucer - shaped circus , a presidential palace designed to replicate the @entity31 , and @entity32 , a 100 - meter - tall tower that has drawn comparisons to a giant lollipop			2
yet just 15 years ago the city did n't really exist at all			2
in 1997 @entity3 's president @entity37 moved the capital from @entity39 in the southeast of the country to the newly - named @entity4 ( previously it was called @entity4 ) , which was then an empty patch of land by the @entity44 best known as a former gulag prison camp for the wives of @entity48 traitors			1
today the bulging , science fiction - like skyline has started to earn the country some international recognition			0
@entity54 , a managing director and partner at @entity56 , the engineering consultants that partnered with @entity19 's firm on the @entity18 and the @entity59 , lauds the local architects ' progressive thinking			0
" they do quite like a challenge , and they do organize themselves to get on with it in a way that 's quite refreshing , " he says			0
" these projects would have taxed the mind of many a high - end contractor , and in @entity3 , they have to address the same problems in a much harder climate			1
" send in your photos from @entity3 the capital 's climate does make construction much more complicated			1
in the winter months temperatures can fall to minus 40 degrees @entity79 ( minus 40 degrees @entity80 ) , making it the second coldest capital city in the world			1
in the summer , the mercury can reach up to 30 degrees @entity79 ( 86 degrees @entity80 )			0
according to @entity86 , a structural engineer at @entity56 , this temperature variance proved particularly challenging when constructing the @entity59			0
" we had to allow a system that relieved the stress and let the structure breathe , " he says			0
the solution they came up with was to lock down one corner of the pyramid , while placing the remaining corners on bridge bearings			0
though common with bridges , such bearings are practically unheard of with entire buildings			0
" basically , it 's on roller skates , " says @entity86			0
" because of the climate , ( the structure ) was bound to be futuristic			0
" from a distance , @entity4 's architecture looks disparate , however a strong @entity3 theme runs through it all			1
@entity32 is meant to evoke the local legend of the " @entity108 " ; the story has a golden egg , and the building is topped with a golden orb			0
the shape of the @entity114 was purposefully made to resemble a traditional @entity3 instrument , known as a dombra			1
since it became the country 's capital , @entity4 's population has more than doubled to 750,000			1
despite this urban growth the size of the new buildings can still seem excessively large			1
the @entity114 is one of the largest in the world , and seats 3,500 spectators , while the @entity126 seats 30,000			0
however , according to @entity129 , a local architect , the reach of these projects matches the local way of thinking			0
" you need to understand the @entity3 background to get a better picture of our world view			1
we 're a nomadic civilization that developed over thousands of years in the vast expanse of @entity139			0
free space is more impressive to the @entity3 mindset than the type of congestion found in many @entity145 centers			1
" numerous architects from across the world have had a hand in shaping the new capital 's skyline , but the one man who has had the greatest impact in the city 's transformation is president @entity37			1
@entity155 , whose @entity157 - based firm , @entity158 , designed the @entity114 , confirms that @entity37 was very hands - on in the structure 's implementation			0
" he used to joke that the building was right in front of his residence ( the @entity166 ) , and that the project 's construction site -- and us , of course -- were always under his control			0
" in many ways , @entity4 looks like a vanity project for @entity37			1
at the top of @entity32 , which grew from a sketch @entity37 did himself , visitors can touch his gilded handprint , and each year , the city 's anniversary celebrations happen to coincide with his birthday			0
@entity37 's advocates , however , argue that @entity4 is n't a symbol of his ego , so much as his ambition for the @entity3 nation			1
one of @entity37 's strongest supporters has come in the unlikely form of @entity189 , a former @entity190 politician , who wrote a recently published biography of the president based on 23 hours of personal interview , and a retrospective of the country			2
" while i 'm sure ( @entity37 ) does have a large ego , it 's more of an ' i love the country ' - centred ego , not an i - centred ego , " says @entity189			2
@entity189 equates @entity201 with the type of patrons that dominated 18th century @entity145 , in particular , @entity204			0
" just as @entity205 and parts of @entity207 were all created by one man 's vision , so too was @entity4 , " he says			1
the city 's futuristic design shows @entity3 's ambition and desire to distance itself from the @entity48 legacy that has marred many of the surrounding @entity217 nations			1
" architecture always represents the development of the state , of technology and of culture , " notes @entity218			2
" as @entity4 is positioning itself as the center of @entity139 , a place where @entity226 , a mixture of styles is quite appropriate			1

@entity4 became capital of @entity3 in 1997
@entity232 is becoming known for striking *modern* architecture
president of @entity3 has played large role in shaping the capital
