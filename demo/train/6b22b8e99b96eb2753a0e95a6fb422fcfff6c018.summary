@entity5 has ordered a new game show from @entity7 based on a popular gift - swapping tradition			1
in " @entity7 's @entity10 , " six contestants will select one package from an assortment of wrapped gifts containing millions of dollars in prizes			1
using strategy , luck , and good guessing , contestants will decide whether or not to steal prizes that have been previously revealed , or gamble that the item in their unopened box is worth more			0
