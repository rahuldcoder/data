-- when @entity2 , a little known @entity3 operating under the name of @entity2 , released " @entity5 " in 2003 , he brought to mainstream attention a new form of musical genre made possible by the advance of modern technology and the @entity11			1
he also inadvertently sparked a debate about record labels ' monopoly of music ownership			2
" @entity5 " consists of a series of " mash - ups , " songs made by splicing together elements from two or more separate tracks , the vocals from one , the music from others			1
@entity2 used the vocal tracks from rapper @entity26 's " @entity25 " and music from @entity29 ' " @entity28 "			1
the album was well received			0
his decision to bring together the world 's biggest hip hop star with the best - selling band of all time probably contributed to its positive reception by the critics			1
it was described as " the most creatively captivating " album of the year by the @entity39 and voted best album of 2004 by @entity41			0
but its success probably owes just as much to the controversy it caused			0
while @entity26 had released his " a capella " vocal tracks with the intention that they could be used as sampling material , @entity2 had borrowed the @entity29 ' music without permission from the copyright holders , @entity54			1
@entity54 moved swiftly to block sales of the album but anti-copyright activists stepped in , and battle lines were drawn			0
@entity59 , a group that campaigns for a fairer music industry , organized an online protest , dubbed " @entity5 " in which they offered up the album to download for free on approximately 170 web sites as a form of deliberate civil disobedience			1
with over 100,000 downloads , @entity59 claims that " @entity5 " was the number one album in the @entity70 on the day			1
the two groups represented polar opposite points of view			0
@entity54 's position was that they earn a livelihood out of the music			2
by blocking the sale of this album they were simply protecting their investment			0
@entity59 , on the other hand , argued that while copyright holders should get a cut of the proceeds from the sale of music , the licence fees were far too high and too large a proportion goes to the music label and not to individual artists			1
moreover , they argued , music was built on a tradition of sharing and much that is good has come from one artist passing the baton to another , who might give a different interpretation , even improve , on an original work			2
" the reason we have copyright is to ensure that creators are able to benefit from the things that they do so that they can keep creating , " says @entity101 , director at @entity59			2
" what 's happened to copyright with music recently is that it has been used as a way to restrict creativity , limit art and censor what people are allowed to do			1
" what made ' @entity5 ' so significant was that it brought together two of the most popular musical acts from two different eras into a totally new piece of art that was considered by everybody as culturally significant			2
there 's no reason why any society would not want that creation to exist			2
" @entity101 says that @entity59 's argument is that copyright should exist but that laws should be reviewed so that bedroom musicians everywhere can have access to sample music without needing a lawyer to guide them through the legal quagmire			1
the " mash - up " is not a new phenomenon			1
in @entity139 music there is a tradition of borrowing tunes and melodies and incorporating them into new compositions			2
western folk music also encouraged the practice of passing on songs for reinterpretation by new generations			2
as a musical genre , the " mash - up 's " origins lie in the birth of hip hop , when @entity3 such as @entity154 and @entity155 began using the drum sections form vinyl records as a back - beat for @entity158 's to rap over			1
the development of the @entity11 has simply fast - forwarded the culture of borrowing by making it all that much easier -- " mash - up " artists have access to so much more music than their forebears			1
and peer - to - peer and social networking sites mean that " mash - ups " have found a distribution system that by - passes the usual gate - keepers - record companies and music stores			1
" there are elements of this idea that have been around for a long time , " says @entity175 of @entity176			0
" @entity181 wrote a piano concerto where every time you finished a bar you 're meant to roll a dice to see what it was you played next			0
" people have always been into the idea of how you can break things down and put them back together and i think it 's something that 's been highlighted recently due to technology and the hip hop ' vibe ' has taken it and tried to twist it around			0
" when people first started recording music it meant you were stuck with just one version			0
there is n't supposed to be a definitive version			0
" it would seem that artists are beginning to cotton on			0
at yourspins.com musicians such as @entity207 , @entity208 , @entity209 and @entity210 have released their work for remixing by the public			0
the musicians provide the user with a selection of variations on the different elements of a song -- bass line , drum , vocals , etc. -- which can be put together in any order			1
the result is " as many versions of the song as there are atoms in the universe , " says @entity175			0
there is one large distinction between what @entity2 was doing with " @entity5 " and the music produced by remixers on @entity176			1
while " @entity5 " was championed as an original work of art , @entity175 does not believe that the same can be said of yourspins.com 's remixes			1
" it 's a hard distinction to defend but [ @entity2 ] picked a couple of things himself			1
there was some creativity in saying : ' i can put this and that together ' , whereas we are giving people a toolkit , " says @entity175			0
in yourspins.com 's legal framework , the copyright still belongs to the artist who can even sell on the remix if they wish			2
@entity175 says that the laws have relaxed since he first set up @entity176			0
" at the beginning a lawyer was telling me that every time someone wanted to go on my web site they would have to sign a paper saying that they were n't going to claim copyright over what they had created , and the artist was going to have to sign a paper giving permission every time , which obviously would n't have worked , " he says			0
technology is breaking down the barriers between musicians and their audiences , allowing both sides to interact in ways that would have been unimaginable thirty years ago , but the record companies are still holding on stubbornly to their monopoly of the market , and it seems there is still a fair way to go before musical culture becomes truly democratic			0
