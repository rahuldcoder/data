@entity11 , 34 , responded by writing him an open letter , published in local newspapers this week , asking him to come to terms with her sexuality			1
in the letter , she told him that she was happy in her relationship and urged him to treat her partner , @entity26 , as " a normal , dignified human being			1
" " if @entity11 's said that this is what she chooses , then it 's all over , " @entity11 said thursday an interview with @entity1 's @entity29			1
he said the huge sum he had offered to potential suitors " stays in my pocket			1
" daughter asks him to accept who she is refusal to welcome partner but the 77 - year - old tycoon , who has three children but has never married , is unable to embrace his daughter 's love life			1
" i ca n't say i am happy with her choice , " he said			2
" if this is her choice then it 's for her			2
" and he said he would n't be welcoming @entity51 , 46 , into his family , despite his daughter 's plea			2
" i have no intention of mixing my life with her life , " @entity11 said			1
" but if this is what she wants , then i respect her choice			0
" his comments follow @entity11 's poignant letter , explaining the situation to him			1
" as your daughter , i would want nothing more than to make you happy , " she writes			0
" but in terms of relationships , your expectations of me and the reality of who i am , are not coherent			0
