-- months after teasing us at @entity4 with an announcement of @entity1 's native @entity7 client for the @entity2 , the free @entity1 for @entity2 will finally be available to download from the @entity8 sometime on tuesday			1
a new application will allow internet chatting via @entity1 on @entity12 's iphones			0
we got a chance to sit down with the application 's principal engineer before the announcement was made at @entity17 , to see @entity1 for @entity2 do its thing			1
while most of the features are n't too surprising -- @entity1 does want to maintain some consistency across its mobile applications , after all -- there are a few capabilities that are notably missing , and a few @entity2 - only perks that are refreshing to see			1
in terms of navigation , @entity1 's @entity7 app for @entity2 looks more like your traditional @entity2 app than it does @entity1 4.0 for @entity30			1
for many who already prefer @entity12 's sleek interface archetype , that 's a triumph , but those who enjoy @entity1 's branding may feel disappointed			0
@entity1 's screens are well organized and use the @entity2 's ability to add filters , for instance , to sort your contacts alphabetically , or by who 's online			1
there 's chatting as well , though @entity1 's flagship feature is its @entity7 calling that 's free to other @entity1 users and an inexpensive per - minute fee to landlines			1
calls on @entity1 for @entity2 work only if you 're in range of a @entity51 , so your call quality will in part be at the mercy and strength of wireless networks nearby -- calls will not work over the cell phone network on the @entity2 ( but chatting will )			1
assuming your connection is solid , you can dial a number or quickly call a contacts stored in your address book			0
@entity65 users will need earphones with an embedded mic to talk			0
during a call , you can mute the line , go on hold , or put the call on speakerphone			0
in the @entity74 window , you can follow a link to buy more skypeout credit online			0
taking a photo from within @entity1 to serve as your avatar image , or pulling a picture in from the camera roll are two @entity2 - only features that makes use of the phone 's hardware attributes			2
another imperfect , but still neat , feature is the ability to accept incoming conference calls			1
while you wo n't be able to initiate a call , we 're told , you will be able to jump on one if a buddy invites you in			0
we hope the next version includes placing conference calls from the @entity2			1
@entity1 left a few more skills out of its maiden @entity2 voyage			2
@entity95 , setting up a conference calling group , purchasing @entity1 credit directly , and being able to field a second incoming @entity1 call are a few			2
file transferring and getting @entity1 voicemail native on the phone are two more			0
we expect to see at least two of these added in the next version , but we 'll hope for more			0
skype versus the competition here 's the big question on our minds : will @entity1 's @entity2 app replace competitors like @entity110 and @entity111 , which focus on cross-network @entity112 but also include @entity7 calls with @entity1 pals even though they 've been available for the @entity2 for months ? @entity115 , the principal engineer for @entity1 for @entity2 , thinks so			1
he says what the other apps use is a workaround that requires them to channel calls through a server and transcode audio , resulting in poorer - quality calls than @entity1 can do in its own app. he may be right , but those who im more than they vocalize probably wo n't ditch the likes of @entity111 too soon			2
they might , however , let @entity1 handle the calls and let another app take care of the multinetwork chatting			2
