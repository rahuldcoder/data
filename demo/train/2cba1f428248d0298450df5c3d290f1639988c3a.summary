@entity0 -- @entity2 may be long gone from the @entity3 and now running the conservative @entity4 , but his blessing is still in demand for @entity8 presidential candidates marching through his home state of @entity11			1
even out of office , @entity2 keeps counsel with a small but loyal network of @entity8 donors in @entity11 , an influential collection of business leaders and former state @entity8 chairmen who have relationships across the state 's political spectrum			1
during the 2012 presidential race , the @entity2 donors flirted with endorsing a presidential candidate and invited the cast of @entity8 contenders to a quasi-debate , the " @entity30 , " in @entity29			0
despite the attention showered upon him , @entity2 ultimately stayed neutral in that primary			0
his allies , meanwhile , splintered among various campaigns			0
this time around , @entity35 is hoping to make an early good impression			2
the @entity41 senator , whose rise in the @entity44 - fueled 2010 election was due , in part , to @entity2 's early endorsement , has quietly arranged to headline a private fundraiser in @entity49 next month for the group 's think tank , the @entity37 , a @entity8 source familiar with the plans told @entity1			1
@entity52 : @entity54 's mustachioed superstition exposed the pending visit makes him the first likely @entity8 contender to come knocking on the @entity2 crew 's door			0
details of the event have yet to be sorted out , but it will take place on october 22 , just a day before @entity35 mentor @entity63 , another possible 2016 candidate from @entity41 , will host a re-election fundraiser in @entity29 for gov. @entity65			1
@entity35 is also planning to attend a grassroots fund - raiser for the @entity67 in @entity29 alongside sen. @entity68 , the man who replaced @entity2 in the @entity3			2
with a team of political advisers that includes @entity71 , a strategist who labored in the trenches of @entity11 politics for over a decade , @entity35 has started to put in serious facetime with the state 's conservative community as he builds a case for the @entity8 nomination in 2016			1
@entity35 was last in the state in august , when he tangled with a group of " @entity81 " who crashed a conservative barbecue in @entity84 and loudly criticized the senator for turning his back on a comprehensive immigration reform bill			2
on that same trip , he held court with a group of social conservative leaders at the @entity49 home of @entity93 , the president of @entity94			0
he also met privately with officials from @entity96 .			0

@entity35 is *meeting* with influential conservatives in @entity11
the @entity41 senator is considering a presidential bid for 2016
@entity11 is a *key* early primary state for presidential nominating contests
