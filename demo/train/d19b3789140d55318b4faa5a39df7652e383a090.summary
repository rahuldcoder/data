@entity0 -- two federal officials admitted tuesday they made " mistakes " during the controversial @entity5 gunrunner program , but they disputed contentions by a parade of other agents that their bureau knowingly let guns " walk " into @entity12			1
" it was not the purpose of the investigation to permit the transportation of firearms into @entity12 , " said @entity13 , former special agent in charge of the @entity16 field office of the @entity17			1
" to the best of my knowledge none of the suspects in this case was ever witnessed by our agents crossing the border with firearms			0
" @entity13 's insistence that guns were not allowed to cross the border drew an angry rebuke from rep. @entity35 , chairman of the @entity36 investigating the program , who called @entity13 a " paid non-answerer " at tuesday 's hearing			1
" are they ( the other agents ) lying , or are you lying ? " @entity35 asked @entity13			1
" we did not let guns walk , " @entity13 responded			1
" you 're entitled to your opinion , not to your facts , " @entity35 said			2
@entity13 and @entity48 , the head of western field operations for @entity17 , both painted themselves as dedicated public servants whose only goal was to help dismantled drug cartels that were benefiting from the free flow of weapons from the @entity55 to @entity12			1
both testified previous tactics aimed at catching and prosecuting gun smugglers were ineffective , and @entity13 said @entity5 was " innovative			2
" he said he " made every reasonable effort " to keep his @entity17 colleagues in @entity12 briefed about the investigation			1
@entity13 said he should have pressed for quicker action by prosecutors , and should have conducted " more frequent risk assessments			2
" @entity48 said his support for the program was based partly on his experience as assistant special agent in charge of the @entity17 's @entity71 office on september 11 , 2001 , which added to his " zeal " to bring down complex criminal networks			1
but with " the advantage of hindsight ... i would have done ( things ) differently , " @entity48 said			0
asked for one example of a mistake , he said he should have more thoroughly reviewed investigative documents that crossed his desk			0
both @entity48 and @entity13 testified tuesday at the hearing of a @entity83			2
at the hearing , several @entity17 agents testified the tactic of allowing guns to " walk " was ill - considered and violated long - established @entity17 policies and practices			1
they also said the @entity17 failed to inform @entity12 authorities of the program , or to even notify @entity55 officials in @entity12			1
the tactic " is insane , " said @entity93 , acting @entity17 attache to @entity12			1
" i can say with authority ' walking guns ' is not a recognized investigative technique , " @entity93 testified			0
" these guns went to ruthless criminals			0
... it infuriates me that people , including my law enforcement , diplomatic and military colleagues , may be killed or injured with these weapons			0
" @entity93 said @entity12 officials regularly complain about @entity55 indifference to @entity12 violence and death , a view he does not share			2
" however , in this particular case , with these specific guns , i am unable to defend this operation			0
" the former @entity17 attache to @entity12 shared that sentiment			1
" i would like to apologize to my former @entity12 law enforcement counterparts and to the @entity12 people for @entity5 , " said @entity116			2
" i hope they understand that this was kept secret from most of @entity17 , including me and my colleagues in @entity12			1
" at the opening of the hearing , @entity35 , @entity123 , accused the @entity127 administration of stonewalling the investigation , saying the @entity129 continues to withhold information and has " inappropriately interfered " with the committee 's work			1
" let me be clear : the @entity129 is not our partner in this effort			0
they are the subject of this investigation and their continued interference will not be allowed to derail the committee 's work , " @entity35 said			1
@entity35 said the @entity129 has blocked efforts to identify those inside the department who were aware of the program , and who endorsed it			2
" we have not yet seen the end of the violence from operation @entity5			0
the deadly consequences of this irresponsible program could last for years to come , " @entity35 said			0
" today the committee estimates at least 1,600 weapons , including .50 caliber sniper rifles , are still out there waiting to kill			0
the possibility that administration officials , perhaps at the highest level of the @entity129 , approved this strategy and are now trying to cover up their own involvement by stonewalling the committee ( is ) alarming , " he said			0
the @entity129 refutes claims by @entity35 that it refused to cooperate with the congressional investigation and is " pushing away " investigators from senior political appointees at the department			2
simply not true , " said @entity129 spokeswoman @entity166			0
" we have provided thousands of documents , interviews , and testimony			0
" but @entity166 was critical of a committee report on the matter , saying it " promotes unsubstantiated theories by selectively releasing excerpts of transcripts while ignoring testimony and other information			0
" " for whatever reason , the leadership of the committee chose not to release witness testimony that makes clear that operational details relating to this investigation were unknown to senior @entity129 officials , " she said			0
" the department , like the committee , is interested in getting to the bottom of the concerns raised by @entity17 agents about this operation , which is why the attorney general has asked the inspector general to investigate the matter			1
the department continues to cooperate with the investigation , but the committee must be willing to share all of the facts			2
" @entity1 's @entity198 contributed to this report .			0

" we did not let guns ' walk , ' " a former @entity17 field office chief says
are the other agents lying , or are you lying , rep. @entity35 asks @entity13
a former @entity17 attache to @entity12 calls the tactic " insane "
the *justice* department denies it is stonewalling the committee 's investigation
