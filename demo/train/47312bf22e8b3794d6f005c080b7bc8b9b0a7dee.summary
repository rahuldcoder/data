@entity0 -- the @entity3 government will temporarily delay a controversial rule that would again permit passengers to carry small knives on commercial flights three days before it was due to take effect			1
the @entity9 said in a statement on monday it would consider additional input from a federal advisory committee that includes aviation - related interests , passenger advocates , and law enforcement experts before activating the new regulation			1
airline passengers had been cleared to carry knives with small blades , including some pocket knives , beginning on thursday			1
the @entity9 did not give a new date for the policy to take effect			2
small knives were banned along with a host of other undersized sharp objects , like nail clippers , screwdrivers and cosmetic scissors , after the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks on the @entity3			1
opinion : letting knives on planes would be insane @entity34 hijackers were believed to have used box cutters to gain control of four jetliners			2
there has been a gradual easing of those prohibitions in recent years as planes hardened onboard security and the potential threats shifted from hijackings to attempts by terrorists to bring down planes with bombs			0
knives are probably the most common items surrendered by passengers at screening points , aside from liquids			0
about 35 knives are seen at @entity56 on an average day and about 47 per day at @entity57 , officials said recently			0
under the plan , knives with blades that are 2.36 inches or shorter and less than a half - inch wide will be allowed in airline cabins so long as the blade is not fixed or does not lock into place			0
@entity9 administrator @entity64 had previously told a @entity65 that his decision on permitting small knives would stand			1
he said it would improve screening efficiency and allow security to focus on items that pose more serious threats to aviation			0
knives on a plane ? really ? but @entity64 has been under pressure from congressional lawmakers , flight crews and others concerned the change dangerously relaxed aviation security and sent the wrong message to a flying public eager for more simplicity and efficiency in passenger and bag screening			1
some of the nation 's biggest carriers have also opposed the policy			0
the @entity9 statement on monday said the delay would enable security planners to weigh new feedback and continue workforce training			1
@entity3 sen. @entity95 said the temporary move is a " solid , commonsense step " toward maintaining safe skies			2
" this delay acknowledges that permitting knives on planes is a bad idea ; now the @entity9 should go the rest of the way and end this flawed policy all together , " the @entity100 @entity99 said in a statement			1
rep. @entity109 , a @entity110 @entity99 , also approved of the delay			0
" now @entity9 can go through the established process , seek input from stakeholders and consult with the ( @entity9 ) workforce -- so we can have a sensible security policy with stakeholder buy - in , " the ranking member of the @entity113 said in a statement			2
@entity1 's @entity122 contributed to this report			0
