-- @entity1 was left reeling sunday after a demoralizing loss to arch - rival @entity4 that kept it a dozen points adrift of a @entity8 spot but there was respite for under - fire manager @entity11 and his team wednesday			1
the @entity13 advanced to the quarterfinals of this season 's @entity8 by thumping @entity16 3 - 0 thanks to a @entity19 hat - trick , thus overturning a 2 - 0 first - leg deficit			1
they were joined in the last eight by 2013 finalist @entity23 , which like @entity1 is struggling domestically but has enjoyed success in @entity26			1
@entity23 overcame @entity27 5 - 4 on aggregate despite losing 2 - 1 wednesday			2
before the game , @entity11 -- one bookmaker lists @entity23 boss @entity30 as the favorite to succeed the @entity32 -- denied reports that he had clashed with @entity35 and @entity19			1
the 40 - year - old @entity35 was reinserted into the starting lineup at @entity37 as part of four changes from the 3 - 0 defeat to @entity4 -- and he made an impact			1
also helping @entity1 was @entity16 ' poor record in @entity43 : the @entity45 side has played 12 times -- and now lost on each occasion			1
" i said to ( my team ) on monday morning we have to win 3 - 0 , give the crowd something back because the crowd here has been incredible , " @entity11 , the successor to managerial giant @entity48 at @entity1 , told @entity50			1
" they deserved a good night because we have n't given them many good nights this season			0
" i 'm not feeling pressure from inside the club			0
it 's all coming from you people , " @entity11 added , referring to the media			2
" i know the job i have to do			0
it 's a big job			0
it 's way bigger than maybe we all expected when we came in			0
" but the players have been great			0
i keep hearing about this one has fallen out or someone else has fallen out and i keep telling people it 's rubbish -- and it is rubbish			0
" @entity77 , who led @entity1 to the league title last term , and @entity80 were isolated in the loss to @entity4 , with the @entity82 spending the majority of his time in midfield instead of up front			1
that was n't the case wednesday			0
bookings , a collision that left @entity1 winger @entity91 with a swollen eye and a glaring miss by @entity16 ' @entity94 highlighted an action - packed opening 15 minutes			1
and when @entity80 struck the post in the 18th minute , some of the @entity1 fans must have thought this might not be their night			2
@entity35 , however -- and not for the first time in his stellar career -- split open the @entity16 defense with a diagonal ball that reached @entity19			2
referee @entity105 pointed to the spot when the striker was pushed by @entity108 and @entity19 made no mistake as he picked himself up in the 25th minute			2
it was always a threat on the counter and @entity112 , now firmly settled in @entity113 , made a sparkling double save in the 40th minute			0
but @entity16 was dealt a blow when @entity19 converted @entity80 's low cross -- after @entity35 ' pivotal ball -- in first - half injury time			1
" i thought @entity35 was fantastic , " said @entity11			2
" sometimes you might be thinking , ' you 'll need to come off after 60 minutes ' but he 's a freak			0
" only six minutes after the break van @entity19 completed his hat - trick with a low free kick			1
@entity16 pushed forward and although @entity112 had to be sharp , he and the @entity1 defense held firm to the delight -- and relief -- of most of those at @entity37			1
@entity77 limped off in the dying stages but @entity11 said his injury " does n't look that bad			0
" @entity23 progresses @entity27 -- which named @entity132 as its new manager this week -- faced a difficult task since it trailed 4 - 2 after the first leg in @entity136 but @entity138 's stunning long - range effort in the 16th minute provided the visitor with hope			1
once midfielder @entity142 leveled in the 39th , though , it was almost impossible for @entity27 to progress			0
even after @entity146 made it 2 - 1 for @entity27 in the second half , it still needed two more goals			0
@entity23 's joy was tempered by a yellow card to striker @entity150 that rules the @entity151 out of the first game of the quarterfinals and @entity142 was displeased with the home crowd , too			2
" maybe they wanted to see a 6 - 1 win , but that does not happen every day , " he told reporters			0
" we have had a lot of injuries this season , but this result shows we are well prepared			0
" defending champion @entity164 , @entity166 , @entity167 , @entity168 , @entity169 and @entity170 join @entity1 and @entity23 in friday 's quarterfinal draw .			1
