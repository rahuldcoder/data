@entity0 , @entity1 -- amid the chaos in @entity1 , an odd standoff played out sunday at one military base on the country 's @entity7 peninsula			1
several hundred men , wearing dark green camouflage uniforms without insignia , surrounded @entity1 's @entity13 base near the @entity7 capital of @entity0 , according to a @entity2 crew that was there			1
but rather than the tense scene one might expect with two forces facing off , the men -- who were on foot and in a dozen or so vehicles -- walked peacefully near 15 @entity1 soldiers standing guard at the base			1
reporters have walked right up to the men in dark green and asked them who they are , but they have refused to respond			1
the @entity1 soldiers are doing the same			1
that mood continued amid crowds of civilians who were there to voice their opinions about the chaos that has enveloped @entity1 in recent months , starting with street protests that were sparked by president @entity39 's rejection of a trade deal with the @entity41			1
@entity39 was ousted february 22			0
there has been a deepening schism in the country ever since , between those in the west -- who generally support the interim government and its @entity41 tilt -- and those in the east , who prefer a @entity1 where @entity53 casts a long shadow			1
emotions are most intense in @entity7 , the last major stronghold of opposition to the new political leadership			1
@entity1 suspects @entity53 of fomenting tension in the autonomous region that might escalate a bid for separation by its @entity53 majority			2
@entity63 mobilized troops and called up military reservists			2

speaking by phone , he said @entity53 troops had blocked access to the bases			0
but , he added , " there is no open confrontation between @entity53 and @entity1 military forces in @entity7			1
" he said @entity1 troops continue to protect and serve @entity1			2
at the base sunday , @entity86 protesters chanted on one side of the street , while @entity91 protesters , including a priest and a man who read aloud from the @entity94 , rallied on the other			2
a group of women sang in support with @entity1			2
those who supported @entity53 intervention marched carrying @entity53 flags			0
they sang " @entity7 is part of @entity53 " and recited verses that suggested former @entity105 premier @entity104 gave @entity7 away , from @entity53 to @entity1 , in the 1950s without the consent of the people			1
there was a brief shouting match between the protesters but the peace was maintained			0
in the meantime , political rhetoric heated up and @entity1 's leaders foreshadowed more ominous days ahead			1
" this is a red alert			0
this is not a threat , " @entity1 interim prime minister @entity117 said			2
" this is actually a declaration of war to my country			0
" speaking in a televised address from the parliament building in @entity63 , he called for @entity53 president @entity126 to " pull back his military and stick to the international obligations			2
" " we are on the brink of the disaster			0
" @entity134 secretary of state @entity133 blasted what he described as @entity53 's " incredible act of aggression " during an appearance on @entity140 's " @entity139 " on sunday other countries are " prepared to put sanctions in place , they 're prepared to isolate @entity53 economically , " he said			0
opinions about what is best for the region are divided			0
in @entity63 , thousands of people rallied in the central @entity149 , the cradle of @entity1 's three - month anti-government protests that led to @entity39 's ouster			1
the crowd held up signs reading " @entity7 , we are with you " and " @entity126 , hands off @entity1			1
" at a military base in @entity7 , a car carrying @entity53 troops rolled up early sunday morning			1
they commanded @entity1 troops to lay down their weapons and mount the @entity53 flag , @entity163 , chief of the @entity164 of @entity1 's @entity165 , told crimean network @entity166			1
a @entity53 captain ordered them to leave			0
" i told him no one is going to leave the base			0
moreover , no one is going to go to the side of the @entity53 , " he said			0
" we only obey commands from @entity63			1
" but back at another military base near @entity0 , a 66 - year - old man named @entity178 marched up to the entrance of the facility carrying a @entity53 flag			0
he told @entity2 that he hoped @entity126 would facilitate democratic elections in @entity1			2
when asked whether he thinks @entity7 should be part of @entity53 or @entity1 , he said , " if you look at it logically , it should be part of @entity53			1
" back in the @entity13 base , more civilians showed up to join the protest groups			0
some women held up signs that said , " @entity194 save your people			0
" a @entity1 woman named @entity198 spoke to @entity2			2
she was skeptical that a peace would hold for long , of the men in the dark green , she said			1
they " say they are here to protect us , but who will they protect us from ? " she asked			0
waving a @entity53 flag , @entity178 , a former soldier , insists @entity7 is @entity53 and should return to @entity53 with @entity126 's help			0
