-- a @entity2 court has ordered an immediate halt to construction of a controversial hydroelectric dam project in the @entity6			1
it 's the latest twist in a long - brewing battle between the @entity2 government and local indigenous communities over the @entity11			1
the government has backed the construction of what would be the world 's third - largest hydroelectric dam , while activists argue that it would displace thousands of local residents and damage the environment			2
in the most recent ruling , announced by regional federal judge @entity22 to reporters , construction is ordered suspended until indigenous communities get a say on the matter before congress , court spokesman @entity19 said			1
injunctions blocking construction have been issued in the past , but the government has successfully overturned them			0
@entity29 approved the @entity11 in 2005 and construction started in 2010 when then - president @entity31 signed a $ 17 billion contract with @entity33 , the consortium chosen to build the dam			1
but lawmakers erred in not seeking input from the indigenous communities beforehand , the judge ruled			1
" the legislation requires consultation ( by indigenous communities ) prior to a decision by congress ( on construction of the dam ) , and what we have is an attempt after the fact , " @entity22 told the state - run @entity50 news agency			1
" @entity29 made a mockery and acted as if it were in a dictatorship , putting the cart before the horse			0
" @entity33 had not received notification of the ruling as of wednesday , and would not comment for the time being , spokeswoman @entity57 said			0
the company will be fined $ 250,000 daily if it does not comply			0
if and when it is completed , @entity11 will be the third - largest dam in the world , after the @entity65 in @entity66 and the @entity67 on the @entity2 / @entity69 border			1
the dam , being built on the @entity71 , a tributary of the @entity6 , will produce 11,000 megawatts and provide electricity for 23 million homes			2
according to @entity33 , after environmental considerations the area to be flooded by the dam was reduced to 516 sq. km ( 200 sq. miles )			0
estimates of the number of people who will be displaced by the construction of the dam range from 19,000 to 40,000			0
the judge also found fault with a previous regional federal court decision that assumed that the country 's supreme court had upheld the constitutionality of the legislation behind the dam construction , according to @entity50			2
the decision in question had been the opinion of a single judge			0
for matters of constitutionality , two - thirds of the high court judges would have to agree .			0

the @entity11 is a controversial project on the @entity71
a judge ordered a stop to construction
the work can not resume until indigenous communities weigh in on the project
