-- what harm does it do ? that 's the challenge the casino industry puts to its critics			1
a new report by the @entity7 presents the answer			1
until the late 1980s , casino gambling was illegal almost everywhere in the country			2
today , casinos are allowed in 23 states			1
these newly authorized casinos are not @entity16 - style grand hotels			1
their customers come from nearby			2
they do n't stay overnight			1
they do n't watch a show or eat in a fine restaurant			1
perhaps most surprisingly : they do n't play cards			1
modern casino gambling is computer gambling			2
the typical casino gambler sits at a computer screen , enters a credit card and enters a digital environment carefully constructed to keep them playing until all their available money has been extracted			2
small " wins " are administered at the most psychologically effective intervals , but the math is remorseless : the longer you play , the more you lose			2
the industry as a whole targets precisely those who can least afford to lose and earns most of its living from people for whom gambling has become an addiction			1
the @entity7 report cites a @entity47 study that finds that the 75 % of casino customers who play only occasionally provide only 4 % of casino revenues			1
it 's the problem gambler who keeps the casino in business			2
slot machine payouts vary state by state			2
some states set a required minimum : 83 % in @entity59 , for example			2
others leave that decision up to the casino , as in @entity64 and @entity65			2
some states require casinos to disclose their payouts			1
in others , that information is kept confidential			2
based on what is published , however , it 's a fair generalization that a player can expect to lose 10 % to 15 % of his or her stake at every session			2
the cheaper the game , the lower the payout : slots that charge $ 5 per round pay better than slots that charge a penny			0
when @entity84 allowed casinos into @entity86 back in 1977 , casino advocates promised that gambling would revive the town 's fading economy			1
the casinos did create jobs as promised			1
but merchants who expected foot traffic to return to the city 's main street , @entity96 , were sorely disappointed			0
the money that comes to the casinos , stays in the casinos			1
liquor stores and cash - for - gold outlets now line the city 's once - premier retail strip			0
the impact of casinos on local property values is " unambiguously " negative , according to the @entity107			1
casinos do not revive local economies			1
they act as parasites upon them			0
communities located within 10 miles of a casino exhibit double the rate of problem gambling			0
unsurprisingly , such communities also suffer higher rates of home foreclosure and other forms of economic distress and domestic violence			0
the @entity7 is sometimes described as a socially conservative group , but with important caveats			0
its president , @entity125 , has publicly endorsed same - sex marriage , and its board of directors is chaired by @entity128 , a former policy adviser to @entity129			0
the @entity7 is as worried that casinos aggravate income inequality as by their negative impact on family stability			1
before the spread of casino gambling , the @entity7 comments , the typical gambler was more affluent than average : it cost money to travel to @entity16			0
that 's no longer true			0
low - income workers and retirees provide the bulk of the customers for the modern casino industry			0
and because that industry becomes an important source of government revenue , the decision to allow casino gambling is a decision to shift the cost of government from the richer to the poorer , and , within the poor , to a subset of vulnerable people with addiction problems			1
from the @entity7 study : " modern slot machines are highly addictive because they get into people 's heads as well as their wallets			0
they engineer the psychological experience of being in the ' zone ' - a trance - like state that numbs feeling and blots out time / space			0
for some heavy players , the goals is not winning money			0
it 's staying in the zone			0
to maintain this intensely desirable state , players prolong their time on the machine until they run out of money - a phenomenon that people in the industry call ' playing to extinction			0
' " how heavily does gambling weigh upon the poor , the elderly , the less educated , and the psychologically vulnerable ? it 's difficult to answer exactly , because @entity184 governments have shirked the job of studying the effects of gambling			1
most research on the public health effects of gambling in the @entity184 is funded by the industry itself , with a careful eye to exonerating itself from blame			1
to obtain independent results , the @entity7 was obliged , ironically , to rely on studies funded by governments in @entity199 and @entity47			0
but here 's what we can conclude , in the words of the institute : " [ s ] tate - sponsored casino gambling ... parallels the separate and unequal life patterns in education , marriage , work , and play that increasingly divide @entity184 into haves and have - nots			1
those in the upper ranks of the income distribution rarely , if ever , make it a weekly habit to gamble at the local casino			0
those in the lower ranks of the income distribution often do			0
those in the upper ranks rarely , if ever , contribute a large share of their income to the state 's take of casino revenues			0
those in the lower ranks do			0
" is this really ok ? are @entity184 content to allow the growth of an industry that consciously exploits the predictable weakness of the most vulnerable people ? 27 states still say " no. " if yours is one such state , fight to keep it that way			1
if not , it 's never too late to find a better way			0
read the full @entity7 study for yourself and see how much is , quite literally , at sake			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity248 .			1

@entity248 says a new report makes clear the damage casinos do
he says they extract earnings from @entity184 least able to afford it
casinos are bad for property values , do n't revive troubled *neighborhoods* , he says
@entity262 : government *benefits* from taxes on casinos and *officials* do n't question the harm
