@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 was 7 years old when war reached his hometown of @entity6 , @entity7			1
for years , even the simplest activities , like walking to school , were an ordeal			2
" it was too scary to go outside much , " @entity3 , now 16 , remembers			2
" if you walk on the street ... you 're nervous you 'd get killed			2
" a group of men once tried to kidnap his father , a chef at a @entity19 restaurant that catered to @entity20			2
the attempt failed , but a threatening letter arrived at his family 's home that same night			2
" they warned us to get out of the country or they would kill us			1
... i was really scared , " @entity3 said			2
the family fled to a small village north , but when @entity3 's school was bombed a year later , they left @entity7 for good			2
they traveled to @entity35 , @entity36 , and applied for refugee status so they could move to the @entity20 legally			2
in 2010 , @entity3 and his family arrived in @entity40			2
the family appreciated the safety of their new home , but they also encountered new problems			0
@entity3 's father struggled to find work , and the entire family found it challenging to navigate a new country and culture			1
" it was really hard because we ( did n't ) speak the language , " @entity3 said			0
he was often so discouraged by his poor @entity56 that he would n't even try to do his homework			0
the social isolation was worse			1
" it was really hard to find friends , " @entity3 said			0
" i was just sitting at home			0
" while working as a refugee case manager for a nonprofit , @entity62 saw many families like @entity3 's struggle to find their footing in the @entity20			1
" you lose a lot of your dignity when you become a refugee , " @entity62 said			1
" you have to flee your country , depend on others			1
you lose your self - esteem			0
" @entity62 said the transition can be particularly challenging for children , who face educational and social barriers			1
the stress they endure often puts them at risk of getting on the wrong track			0
" their families have sacrificed everything for them to get here			0
so if ( their kids ) do n't succeed , that 's the biggest tragedy , " said @entity62 , 25			1
" it 's something that i 'm not going to allow			0
" to help support young refugees , @entity62 started the @entity91 program in 2009			1
the name is an acronym for @entity94 , but in @entity95 it simply means " @entity96			0
" @entity91 provides free tutoring and soccer training to 200 boys and girls in the @entity40 area			1
while soccer is what mostly motivates the players , it 's just a carrot to @entity62			1
many of his players have missed years of formal schooling on their road to the @entity20 , so the mandatory twice - a - week tutoring sessions are an integral part of the program			1
" when they get here , they 're years behind , and they 're years behind in a different language , " @entity62 said			1
" so the need is just immense			0
we 're working to get them literate in @entity120 , getting them ... caught up			0
" the @entity91 staff also makes sure the players are registered to receive 25 hours of one - on - one tutoring from a statewide program			1
when necessary , @entity91 also provides additional tutoring to those who are struggling			2
the hope is to help everyone get up to grade level and on a path to college			0
do you know a hero ? nominations are open for 2012 @entity136 according to the @entity139 , more than 10,000 refugees from around the world have moved to the @entity40 area legally since 2007 , making it one of the largest refugee resettlement areas in the country			1
many of those newcomers , like @entity3 , are @entity7 who are under 18			0
the vast majority live in @entity0 , a city in @entity148 where @entity91 is based			0
@entity62 spreads the word about the group by visiting area schools			1
most of the players in the program are @entity7 , but the group has players from across the @entity157 , @entity158 and @entity159			2
sometimes ethnic and religious differences can lead to conflict , but @entity62 says that as the soccer season progresses , the differences fall by the wayside			1
" their families have endured the same struggles , " @entity62 said			1
" when they realize that ... they become like brothers and sisters			0
" some children have lost more than their homeland			0
some have witnessed one of their parents being killed , or they 've been kidnapped and tortured themselves			0
@entity62 , who helps run many of the practices , tries to keep the atmosphere serious but fun so that time on the field is a much - needed escape			1
" soccer is ( the ) best therapy , " @entity62 said			1
" they have an hour or two to forget about everything and just be kids			0
" @entity62 cares deeply because he faced many of the challenges the refugees are experiencing			1
he was never officially a refugee , but his family left @entity35 during @entity36 's 15 - year civil war , a conflict in which three members of his extended family were killed			0
@entity62 's family lived in several places -- including the @entity20 , where his father attended college -- before permanently immigrating to the @entity40 area when @entity62 was 9			1
for him , the social adjustment was particularly rough			2
" i had all the wrong clothes on , and i got made fun of , " he said			0
" they called me ' poor kid			0
' my self - esteem was really , really low			0
" that changed when he discovered @entity208 , scoring a touchdown the first time he got the ball			0
" sports was the way i got confident , made friends and felt i was like other kids , " he said			2
he went on to earn a football scholarship at @entity217 , a small private school in @entity218 where he studied foreign relations			0
after graduating in 2008 , @entity62 planned to go to @entity220 to get a graduate degree in refugee studies			1
but on a visit home that summer , he learned about the large influx of refugees that @entity40 had experienced in recent years			2
" i started thinking to myself , ' why am i going halfway across the world to learn about refugees when they 're all here in my own hometown ? ' " he said			2
instead of going to graduate school , @entity62 got a job with @entity232 , helping refugees settle into their new lives			1
he was troubled to see so many children sitting at home , alienated , but he also noticed how they lit up when they saw a soccer ball			2
one day , he brought a ball with him while making a home visit			0
as he approached the apartment complex , he heard a boy yell the @entity95 word for ball			0
@entity62 began kicking it around with him , and within minutes , 20 kids had joined the game			1
that moment gave kabban the inspiration for @entity91 's approach			0
although the organization is relatively new , @entity91 has managed to get funding from local foundations and businesses			0
everything -- tutoring , soccer and occasional field trips -- is provided at no cost , something the kids appreciate , as nearly all of them know that money is tight at home			1
@entity62 has also made it a priority to reach out to those who are n't refugees			1
when refugees started arriving in the area , there was tension in schools between them , @entity275 and @entity158 - @entity20			2
to counteract this , @entity62 started the @entity277 , a soccer league open to everyone in the area			1
" we wanted to bring them all together and start making a community , " he said			0
" now it looks like the @entity283 here every sunday			0
" ultimately , @entity62 hopes to build a " peace - building " charter school for refugees , immigrants and marginalized youth that would use soccer in a formal college prep program			1
@entity62 's commitment to the organization is so strong that for more than a year he has worked full - time without a salary , living off his savings			1
the kids at @entity91 know he quit his job for them , and they 're quick to acknowledge the huge difference he has made in their lives			0
" i do n't know the way ( to ) say thank you to coach @entity62 , " @entity3 said			1
" they helped me to find friends , and they ( taught ) me how to speak @entity120			0
... now , with @entity91 and coach @entity62 , it 's a fun life			1
" stories like that are what push @entity62 to keep going			1
" this country gave my family the chance to succeed , " he said			2
" i want to help these kids do the same thing			0
" want to get involved ? check out the @entity91 website at @entity313 and see how to help .			0
