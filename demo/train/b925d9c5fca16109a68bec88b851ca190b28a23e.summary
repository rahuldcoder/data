@entity0 -- three @entity3 activists are being held aboard a @entity5 ship monday after illegally boarding the vessel to protest @entity5 's annual whale hunt in @entity9 waters			1
the three men are not yet under arrest , but are being questioned by @entity5 's @entity14 , a spokesman for @entity5 's @entity11 said monday , declining to be identified as is customary in @entity5			1
the @entity3 attorney - general , @entity15 , said that her government was working to secure the release of the men , but that she believed they could face criminal charges in @entity5			1
video footage released by the anti-whaling group @entity21 shows the three men , from the environmental group @entity23 , approaching the @entity5 vessel on a small boat on sunday			1
the video shows their boat pull up next to @entity5 's @entity29 # 2 , a patrol vessel supporting @entity5 's whaling mission in the @entity9 waters			2
a voice from the small boat calls out , " go , go , go ! " as the men slip onto the @entity5 ship			1
in the background , voices in @entity5 scream in alarm , saying " they 're boarding ! " @entity21 described the three activists -- @entity41 , 47 , @entity42 , 44 , and @entity43 , 27 -- as " prisoners			1
" the organization said the men boarded the vessel to force @entity5 's fleet to stop hunting whales			2
@entity5 annually hunts whales despite a worldwide moratorium , utilizing a loophole in the law that allows for killing the mammals for scientific research			0
each year , environmental groups like @entity21 face off with @entity5 's hunters in a high seas drama that has led to collisions of ships , the detaining of activists and smoke bombs fired back and forth between the groups			1
two days before he boarded the @entity5 vessel , @entity42 said in a video released by @entity21 that stopping @entity5 's hunts was a personal responsibility			0
" we 've got a big responsibility for all those people in future generations , " he said			0
@entity3 's @entity15 said the countries were engaged in diplomatic discussions to ensure the well - being and safety of the three men , but called it a " difficult situation			2
" @entity15 said that while @entity3 steadfastly opposes @entity5 's whale hunt , the incident did not happen in @entity3 territorial waters			1
" that does n't give us rights for @entity3 law to automatically apply , " she said			0
" in fact , our advice is that @entity5 law will apply because a @entity5 boat is the one that 's been boarded			0
" this is the third time activists have boarded ships involved in the @entity5 whaling fleet			2
in 2008 , two @entity21 activists sneaked aboard a @entity5 vessel			2
they were released back to the anti-whaling group			0
in 2010 , @entity96 , a @entity97 , also boarded the @entity29 # 2			0
@entity96 was arrested , taken back to @entity5 , and tried in a @entity0 court			0
