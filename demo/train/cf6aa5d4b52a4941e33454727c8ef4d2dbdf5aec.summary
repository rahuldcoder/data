-- @entity2 's grungy beard — presumably as well as other elements of @entity4 -- drew in $ 44 million this weekend , perching it atop a @entity6 of box office receipts with a moderately impressive sum by any measurement ( including cubits )			1
@entity13 's @entity12 bonanza took the no. 1 spot , knocking all the films from last week 's @entity16 down one slot			0
the theologically loose adaptation fared better than the last time @entity2 went gallivanting around in a tunic , in 2010 ′ s @entity20			0
( that period epic only made $ 36 million in its first weekend			1
) however , there was n't exactly a rainbow at the end of the storm , considering audiences gave @entity4 a " c " @entity28 rating			1
the @entity30 : @entity31 — er , @entity32 -- could n't quite muster enough @entity34 fandom or non-reader interest to push its to - date take over the $ 100 million mark			2
the fantasy drama sits comfortably in a distant second with $ 26.5 million for the weekend , making for a grand total of $ 95.3 million			2
with a reported budget of $ 85 million , this certainly is n't a dystopian scenario for the proposed trilogy , but it is less than half of what both films in @entity48 series had made by the end of their second weekends			2
in third place , @entity52 slipped only 33 percent from its opening weekend to $ 11.4 million , bringing its total up to $ 33.2 million			1
the film — a sequel to the 2011 reboot of the beloved @entity59 characters — is n't performing quite as strongly as its predecessor , but as @entity61 knows , it ai n't easy making green			0
the other family - friendly film on offer , @entity64 's mr. @entity62 , followed up in fourth with $ 9.5 million			0
putting @entity69 - based films both on the top and bottom of this weekend 's @entity16 , the pro-deity tract @entity67 found an additional $ 9.1 million in the collection plate this sunday , bringing it to more than $ 22 million all together			1
@entity75 's drug bust thriller @entity76 , on the other hand , seems to have been forsaken , belly - flopping into seventh place with only $ 5.3 million — pretty dismal for a movie with so much supposed star power			0
here 's the @entity80 : 1 ) @entity4 -- $ 44 million 2 ) divergent - $ 26.5 million 3 ) @entity52 -- $ 11.4 million 4 ) mr. @entity62 - $ 9.5 million 5 ) @entity67 -- $ 9.1 million see the original story at @entity0			1
