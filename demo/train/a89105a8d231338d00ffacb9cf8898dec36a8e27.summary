-- i 'm standing in the secret @entity3 apartment where @entity4 and her family spent two years hiding from @entity6 during the @entity7			1
the place is a mess -- crumpled sheets cover the bed in the corner , pots and pans clutter the dinner table and stubbed - out cigarettes fill the ashtray			2
this is n't surprising given that the @entity20 family and four others hiding alongside them were dragged away by @entity23 security police just the night before			0
it 's an arrest i saw happen -- along with more than a thousand other people watching a spectacular new stage show that brings @entity20 's time in hiding to life so vividly that some were moved to tears			1
the play , simply titled " @entity4 , " is a major new production staged in a purpose - built theater on the outskirts of @entity3			1
it 's hoped the production -- which features lavishly designed sets that revolve and glide across a giant panoramic stage -- will bring the story of the young @entity40 diarist to a new generation			1
no expense has been spared			0
intensely realistic stage sets two of @entity46 's best known playwrights were commissioned to pen the new drama and a multimillion dollar budget spent on intensely realistic stage sets			1
" the level of detail is crazy , " says @entity49 , the show 's @entity50 … ward - winning producer , as he takes me behind the scenes , where a life - sized @entity3 apartment block is parked , ready to roll on stage			1
@entity49 's sets include the @entity60 ' original home , and a rotating replica of the annex where they hid from @entity64 persecution between june 1942 and august 1944			2
" it 's really the only way you can experience exactly what went on in all those rooms and what the relationship was between all those rooms , " he says			0
there 's also a breathtaking and beautiful final scene in the snowy desolation of @entity76 , the concentration camp where @entity20 died at the age of 15 -- her childhood dreams snuffed out by the @entity80			0
standing ovations followed the play 's premiere in may , as did largely glowing reviews			1
it 's acted in @entity86 , but subtitled and dubbed audio translations will be introduced in july , opening it up to international audiences			1
its creators hope it will become a permanent fixture , attracting some of the visitors who line up for hours to see the original annex inside @entity3 's canal - side @entity97			1
the new dramatization aims to present a more faithful image of the ambitious teenager -- whose rebellious nature and adolescent desires were originally edited out of her published diary			0
' glimpses of a life she never had ' husband and wife co-authors @entity108 and @entity112 used @entity20 's original writings to conjure scenes of a postwar dream life in @entity116 -- another stunning stage set			0
there @entity20 discusses her unpublished book with a handsome young publisher , who falls in love with her and joins us as we flashback to her time in hiding			0
" it 's all inspired by @entity4 's own writing , " says @entity123			1
" it 's her dream to have this grand student bohemian life in @entity116 and @entity129 -- and to become famous and we used these remarks to see glimpses of a life she never had			0
" despite its tough subject matter , there are a moments of levity , such as when @entity20 clashes with @entity140 , a dentist who shared a room in the secret annex with @entity4 and her sister			1
the writers say they tried to strike a careful balance in showing respect for the memory of those involved while still producing an entertaining play			2
" it 's almost like a tragic - comedy -- a very cruel sitcom , " says @entity123			2
" but if the diary was not entertaining , we would not be talking about it right now			0
" ' dreams and hopes ' among those enjoying the show during one recent performance was @entity160 , a 21 - year - old student from @entity3			1
" it 's just such a big part of @entity86 history , " she says			1
" it happened just around the corner , and it 's important for us to know about it			0
" for tourists something like this is good			0
they should be aware of what happened here -- and not just come to @entity3 for the drugs			1
" in the play 's current cast , the role of @entity20 is taken by @entity179 , a formidable 27 - year - old actress who flits effortlessly between portrayals of childhood , adolescence and young adulthood			1
not @entity40 herself , she joined the rest of the cast on fact - finding trips to @entity189 concentration camp and spoke with @entity40 people who went into hiding like @entity4			1
" she was such a small girl and she had so many dreams and hopes , " she says			0
" but because she was @entity40 , those dreams were n't possible			0
" @entity195 says she recognized some of @entity20 's determination in herself and a similar childhood ambition to succeed			0
" and that 's the really big thing with @entity4 , a lot of people identify themselves with her , " she says			2
the @entity202 , an educational charity that holds soon - to - expire copyright to the diary , commissioned the play in the hope of reaching out to a new generation almost 70 years after @entity20 died			2
@entity49 says judging by the experience of showing the play to his own teenage son and his friends , it hits the mark			2
" they 're watching themselves and they 're completely relating to all of this because they 're going through it right now : annoying parents , being trapped in the house , falling in love , sexuality			0
" i promise you , any 14 - , 15 - or 16 - year - old will go crazy over this			2
it will be a meaningful experience			0
and that 's what we have to achieve -- to find that audience			0
