@entity0 , @entity1 -- human rights groups from the @entity4 and @entity1 filed a lawsuit in a @entity1 court thursday , charging @entity8 's former president , @entity7 , with covering up crimes against humanity			1
@entity7 in 1994 shortly after he voted during the country 's second round presidential runoff			2
the case involves the killing of six @entity16 priests , their housekeeper and her teenaged daughter nearly two decades ago during @entity8 's civil war			1
in addition , 14 former @entity8 military officers are accused of war crimes , murders and state terrorism in connection with the massacre dating back to november 1989			1
most of the slain @entity28 were born in @entity1			1
they were killed at their residence at the prestigious @entity30 , in @entity8 's capital , @entity32			1
reports at the time said they were tortured and then shot			0
it has become one of the most notorious episodes of @entity8 's 12 - year civil war that pitted leftist guerrillas against the @entity4 - backed conservative government			1
the case filed by two human rights groups in @entity0 argues that justice was never done in @entity8			2
two military officers were convicted of murder in 1991 in the deaths of the @entity28 , but were pardoned in 1993 under an amnesty law approved by the national assembly			1
the case was taken to @entity1 's @entity50 , because of its involvement in other high - profile human rights cases			1
the same @entity1 court issued an arrest warrant for former @entity56 dictator @entity55 in 1998 , while he was in a @entity58 hospital			2
for the rest of his life he fought legal battles -- first in @entity62 and later in @entity56 -- to avoid convictions			0
the @entity1 court has also taken on human rights cases from other countries , including @entity67 and @entity68 , testing a relatively new international legal principle known as @entity70			2
it contends that if justice for human rights abuses is not served in the country where the crime occurred , then a court in another country can intervene			0
the groups filing suits are the @entity81 - based @entity80 and the @entity82			0
family members from at least two of the slain @entity28 will join the lawsuit later , the groups said			1
it could take the @entity50 weeks or even months to determine if it will accept the case			0
@entity1 and @entity8 have an extradition treaty			2
but a lawyer for the @entity80 told @entity2 that the most immediate practical effect of the case might be an effective ban on @entity7 and the 14 former officers from leaving @entity8 , for fear of arrest			1
if they were ever tried before a @entity1 court and convicted on the charges , they could serve up to 30 years in prison			2
in an interview with @entity2 a few months before he was killed , university rector @entity102 praised then - president @entity7 , whom the human rights groups now accuse of covering up the crime			0
" we have to recognize that @entity7 is a man of his word , who keeps his promises , " @entity102 told @entity2			0
" personally i consider @entity7 an ethical , responsible person who will not offer to do what he ca n't or does n't wish to do			0
" @entity112 , another slain @entity16 , spoke at the time about the chilling effect of the long - running @entity8 civil war			1
" we have become used to violence , " @entity112 said			0
" we have become used to living in a very dangerous world			0
we have learned to live , accepting death , extraordinary abnormal death into our lives			0
" for years , the extreme right in @entity8 had accused the @entity28 of siding with the leftist guerrillas , according to a @entity2 report shortly after the killings			1
uniformed troops were seen searching the living quarters of the priests at @entity30 two days before they were killed , @entity2 reported .			0

case involves killing of 6 @entity16 priests , their housekeeper and her daughter
14 former @entity8 military officers also accused of war crimes
