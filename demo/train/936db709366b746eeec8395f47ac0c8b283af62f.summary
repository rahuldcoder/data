when leaving @entity1 one year ago , @entity0 thought he would find a better life in @entity3			1
instead he found himself a victim of modern slavery			1
the soft - spoken 21 - year old was smuggled across the border by labor brokers with the promise of a safe and stable job at the end of the journey			2
he was prepared for hard work at a pineapple factory that would enable him to save money and pay back the man who helped take him across the border			2
instead he said that he and 12 others who made the journey with him were sold for around $ 430 each into jobs that made them virtual slaves			0
to @entity0 's horror he was taken onto a fishing boat , despite no experience of fishing , and for the next six months was forced to work without pay			2
according to @entity0 , some of the girls in his group were sent to work in seafood processing factories , while the prettier ones were sent to brothels			1
" i felt very depressed when i first arrived on the boat , like i was in hell , " he said			0
" i was beaten because i did n't know how to do the work properly			0
" @entity0 's story is not unique			0
according to a new report by the @entity40 ( @entity40 ) , a @entity41 - based human rights charity , the @entity3 fishing and seafood industry , worth $ 7 billion annually , involves considerable exploitation of trafficked migrant workers , most from neighboring @entity1 and @entity46			1
@entity0 was fortunate to escape after nine months working on the boat			0
by pretending to be ill he was able to go ashore long enough to flee to @entity48 , a resort town to the south of @entity50 , and take refuge in a temple			0
he remains there , unsure of his future or if any of the people involved in his ordeal will face prosecution			0
he asked @entity58 not to use his real name for fear of reprisals			0
brutal conditions many others echo his testimony of coercion and harsh conditions on board fishing boats			2
a group of 14 men from @entity1 rescued from boats last year told the @entity40 of 20 hour work days with little or no pay and beatings at the hands of @entity3 crew members			1
according to reports from the @entity40 some even witnessed murder , with bodies being thrown overboard as causally as unwanted catch			2
speaking from a government shelter in the south of @entity3 where they have been for nearly one year , most are now disillusioned and more interested in just going home than finding justice , said @entity85 , founding director of the @entity40			1
" if they give up and say ' we just want to go home , ' the case that surrounds everyone that exploits them collapses and there wo n't be further action , " he said			0
" it 's not good enough to say the judicial process is slow in @entity3			2
in effect they are punishing these people again			0
they are the innocents involved			0
" the rise in forced labor on board @entity3 fishing boats is tied to growing global demand for cheap seafood and diminishing fish stocks , say the @entity40			1
fishing boats have to make longer trips for less catch , making an already tough job harder and less attractive to domestic workers , as well as threatening profit margins for all involved in the industry			1
taking action last year the @entity3 government announced a national action plan to prevent human trafficking and support its victims			1
together with national fishing associations and civil action groups , the @entity117 assisted the @entity120 ( @entity120 ) with its 2013 report on trafficked workers in the fishing sector			1
the report found that one in six working on long - haul fishing boats did not decide to do so willingly , but acknowledged that the vast majority of workers in the sector are @entity3 and work voluntarily			1
" there are real concerns regarding forced labor in the fishing industry , said @entity133 , senior program officer for the @entity120			1
" in the past years there has been engagement from the government and national fishing associations to @entity120 initiatives and we 've seen more commitment from the central level but not yet seen concrete results			2
" the sector has been this way for a long time and there are no quick or easy fixes			0
turning this around is long process , but we 're hoping to see the result			0
" both the @entity150 and @entity40 have been critical of @entity3 attempts to clampdown on human trafficking in the country citing widespread corruption among law enforcement officials			1
according to a 2013 @entity150 report , the @entity3 marine department and navy inspected 608 fishing vessels in 2012 but found no cases of trafficked workers , suggesting corruption and inadequate financial and human resources were allowing the continued exploitation of workers			1
@entity3 's @entity117 for @entity166 and the @entity167 have not responded to @entity58 's requests for comment , but the government has said in the past that it is committed to fighting human trafficking			1
pressure to change @entity0 said he witnessed police taking bribes from boat owners who had undocumented crew members			0
but @entity85 believes that links between authority figures , boat owners and human traffickers can be even more brazen			0
" we have documented evidence of marked police cars transporting trafficked victims who are then sold onto boats as slaves , " said @entity85			1
" it 's an absurd situation where you have those paid to protect people conniving in their abuse			2
" @entity58 could not reach the @entity194 for comment on the claims			0
" the problem really lies with many of the people that run these local businesses who are brutal and corrupt , " said @entity85			0
" it seems that political and market driven pressure combined is the only way the industry is going to change			2
" @entity3 is currently listed as a @entity209 watch - list country on the @entity150 's @entity210 ( @entity211 ) and will drop to tier 3 -- the lowest classification this year -- if it does not improve , something the @entity40 is calling for			1
the results could be the withdrawal of international financial aid .			0
