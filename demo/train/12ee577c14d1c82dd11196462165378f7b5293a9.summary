-- the @entity1 released thursday what it says is video showing gruesome images of many dead chickens -- and in some cases , mummified chicken carcasses -- at a farm in southeastern @entity8			1
the animal protection organization says the video is from an undercover investigation it conducted at @entity14 in @entity15 , @entity8 , in february and march			1
@entity14 , on its website , describes itself as " a real working farm supplying fresh quality eggs , milk , drinks and premium batch - churned ice cream to select wholesalers and retail stores			1
" the video , played in a news conference , showed dead chickens in cramped cages surrounded by live chickens and eggs			1
many of the birds appeared to be trapped either in cage wire or in automated feeding machinery			0
" during the investigation , thousands of birds died of dehydration when there was a water system malfunction that people did n't notice for two or three days , " said @entity35 , vice president of the @entity1			0
" @entity43 's legs and wings and more were found stuck inside of the wires of the cages , trapping these animals , preventing them from gaining access to food or water			0
some of the floors in these barns were so packed with dead flies that our investigator described the experience as similar to walking on top of @entity59			1
" but @entity14 president and ceo @entity61 issued a statement disputing the @entity64 's claims			1
" the allegations by @entity1 are a gross distortion of @entity14 , our employees and the way we care for our birds , " the statement read			1
" there are still many unanswered questions regarding how and when this video was shot , edited and assembled			2
" the @entity64 is pushing for passage of a bill currently in the @entity75 that it says would lead to a friendlier system of egg production			1
the bill is supported by the @entity78 , which represents farmers responsible for more than 80 % of the country 's egg production			2
other influential food - industry organizations , however , are opposed to the legislation			2
the @entity85 , for example , issued a news release in january calling it a " farm takeover bill , " and saying " it would set a ' dangerous precedent ' for allowing the federal government to regulate on - farm production practices , including animal housing			2
" the bill calls for an increase in the size of chicken cages , with the aim of preventing cramped and unsanitary conditions in which chickens lay eggs			1
the law would be phased in over an extended period to give farms time to make the necessary changes			0
it is unclear when the @entity75 might take up the bill for consideration			0
@entity61 said in his statement @entity14 supports such legislation and asserted that more than 80 % of the chickens there are already housed in new , larger , state - of - the art facilities			1
still , @entity35 said the conditions on farms such as @entity61 's are n't acceptable and threaten the health of people			2
" there is a direct connection many times between how we treat animals and problems that we cause for ourselves , " he said			0
" oftentimes when we abuse farm animals , we 're not doing ourselves any favors in the process			0
" there 's a clear case to be made , for example , that increasing the amount of birds who are cramming in together , giving them less and less space , increases the risk of salmonella infection			0
in fact , at @entity14 we saw they were testing positive for salmonella at this facility			0
and so it 's important to recognize that , of course , the cruelty to animals by itself is extraordinarily problematic , but there 's also a consumer safety aspect to this			0

the @entity64 shows video of dead chickens at an egg farm
the farm calls the allegations of *inhumane* conditions " a gross distortion "
the @entity64 is pushing passage of legislation to create better conditions
