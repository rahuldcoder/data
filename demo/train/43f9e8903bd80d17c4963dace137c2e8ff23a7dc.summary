-- when online media first arose , one of the common complaints about it was that it was n't very portable			1
unlike books or magazines , you could n't easily read your desktop or laptop on the bus or in the bathroom			0
but mobile digital media hold the promise of a return to convenient portable reading			1
and new statistics from the popular online reading list service @entity18 indicate that mobile devices are not only changing where people are reading but when			1
@entity18 is a free service that allows internet users to save the full text of articles and other content they encounter online on a personal reading list			1
it then displays this content in a format that 's very friendly to mobile devices			2
i use @entity18 ( and one of its competitors , @entity33 ) to save longer - format content ( like 5,000 - word @entity36 's articles ) for later digital reading in a way that i find easier on the eyes than extended reading sessions on a web browser			1
almost always , this means reading articles on my @entity45 phone -- usually when i 'm on public transit or waiting in line somewhere but often also when i 'm lying in bed			1
according to a recent @entity18 blog post , users of this service save articles to their lists at a fairly constant pace throughout the day , but they read this content mostly in the evening , from 6 to 9 p.m. but when @entity57 took a close look at statistics for its @entity61 and @entity62 users , a different trend emerged			1
for @entity61 users , there tended to be four peak reading times : 6 a.m. : early morning , breakfast 9 a.m. : morning commute , start of the workday 5 - 6 p.m. : end of the workday , commute home 8 - 10 p.m. : @entity72 time , prime time , bedtime " in reality , this really is a graph of whitespace time , " says the post			2
" @entity78 is the time between a and @entity79 it 's the time on the subway or bus			0
it 's the time standing in line			0
it 's a spare moment			0
" for @entity62 users , @entity57 noticed one especially huge peak reading time : 8 to 10 p.m. " this time slot is the same one coveted by television			0
when the majority of people are consuming content it seems perfectly natural that people would use this time to do their reading as well			1
" @entity57 also found that " @entity62 owners are no longer doing the majority of their reading on their computers			0
" this makes sense to me , since @entity62 are primarily media consumption devices while computers and smartphones are better suited for communication and content creation			2
@entity18 did not offer statistics for @entity45 devices , but this service does not offer its own @entity45 app. @entity45 app by @entity111 is supported by the @entity112 and is one option for @entity45 users			2
the opinions expressed in this post are solely those of @entity117			0
thanks to @entity118 of the @entity119 for bringing the @entity18 post to my attention .			0
