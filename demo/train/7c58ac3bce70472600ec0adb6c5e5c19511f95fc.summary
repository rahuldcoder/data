-- hey , young readers : instead of another summer uttering the dreaded phrase " i 'm bored , " how about meeting a @entity3 astronaut or building a working potato cannon ? @entity7 , which kicks off its second year on july 8 , is different kind of summer camp for kids and teens			1
instead of canoes and kickball , it has microcontrollers and robots			0
there are no bus rides or cabins ; camp can take place anywhere there 's a computer and an internet connection			1
the camp is a free , six - week online program inspired by the maker movement -- the trend toward do - it - yourself culture -- and run by @entity28 in collaboration with @entity30			1
@entity28 also publishes make magazine and organizes the @entity32			0
the virtual camp guides kids through daily diy projects and connects campers to each other using the @entity39 social network			1
each week has a different theme , and kids are encouraged to share their creations and ask questions during daily video broadcasts			0
the lifeblood of the camp are daily @entity47 where makers , counselors and other special guests lead young viewers through a project			1
the day 's project and supply list is posted in the morning and the hangouts start at 11 a.m. @entity56 ( 2 p.m. et )			0
participants must be at least 13 to have a @entity39 profile , but many parents of younger kids use their own log - ins and do the projects together			1
they can also be viewed on @entity63			0
" it is like a camp			1
you go there , you choose an arts and crafts project or you choose archery and meet other people interested in the same things , " said @entity28 founder and ceo @entity66			0
this year , the camp will kick off with a live broadcast from the new @entity78 science museum in @entity79 , where kids will learn how to build a motorboat made from a soda bottle			1
all the most popular projects from last year will be back , including robotic birds , intro to computer science and mold making			1
the first week is all about motion , but there are also weeks dedicated to music , games and special effects , such as usingg make - up and arduino pieces ( open - source electronics ) to turn yourself into a cyborg			0
other projects might tackle the growing field of 3 - d printing , which employs computer models to replicate three - dimensional plastic objects			1
on fridays , the camp will broadcast from other locations for " field trips			2
" planned destinations this summer include the @entity108 campus and a trip to see the @entity112 's @entity111 racing yachts			2
hands - on education the idea for @entity7 originated with @entity30			1
last spring , the company approached @entity117 with a detailed plan for a virtual camp where kids could participate in @entity122 projects from anywhere with an internet connection			1
@entity30 was looking for a project that would show - off the @entity39 platform , specifically @entity47			1
@entity30 is so involved with the camp that it has its name on all the @entity7 branding , an unusual step for the company			1
aside from the promotional opportunities , both companies hope the free camp can encourage more kids to get into building , tinkering , hacking and crafting			1
from there , it could spread into schools			0
" this will infect education , " said @entity28 editorial director @entity140			0
" there is a desperate desire and need for this stuff			0
people want this kind of creativity and building in education			0
" maker media is helping drive the burgeoning maker movement , and many educators are jumping on board			0
they see these hands - on projects as a way to get kids excited about science and technology , which is increasingly important as the @entity162 works to produce more science , technology , engineering and math ( @entity168 ) professionals			1
" it is a gateway to @entity168 , but we 're not sitting there saying ' here 's the velocity of a rocket , ' " said @entity117			0
" by having these experiences , they do n't have in school , it encourages them to learn more about it			0
" connecting kids over the internet who are passionate about tinkering and science lets them know that they are not alone			2
but that does n't mean campers do n't get lonely			0
this year organizers are branching out into real - world meet - ups by bringing kids together in their communities to form their own minicamp cells			2
last year , some librarians took it upon themselves to integrate the projects into their regular summer programming			1
this year , @entity7 is doing an official affiliate program , working with 100 partners around the country			1
each official partner gets a @entity7 starter box filled with starter supplies , lesson materials and a guide			1
organizers are n't sending out @entity206 printers , but a surprising number of libraries already have their own @entity206 printers up and running			2
@entity209 , the teen librarian at the @entity210 just north of @entity79 , is doing her second year of @entity7			1
she says the projects can teach basic skills that adults take for granted			2
while building pistons for a @entity217 - and - @entity216 project , she found some kids did n't know how to use a screwdriver			0
live from camp most of the sessions will be broadcast live on @entity39 from the @entity28 headquarters in @entity224 , @entity225			2
there is no tv crew or elaborate video set up for the broadcasts			0
the camp organizers say their target audience does n't respond well to overproduced content , so they keep it simple and scrappy			1
a prefab studio has been set up on a grassy lawn behind the offices , a few steps away from the local community garden			0
some days the camp will broadcast live from the @entity240 , a minimaker heaven filled with every tool imaginable , including @entity206 printers and @entity245 manufacturing machines			2
the lab is staffed by paid interns and employees , led by @entity246 supervisor @entity249 , who looks the part of a young mad scientist in his white lab coat			0
the crew builds and tests projects for the magazine , such as a hexacopter , a homemade segway and a @entity259 coil			2
a handful of librarians and former and future campers got a tour of the @entity264 and studio and checked out one of last year 's potato cannons , which were actually used to shoot ping pong balls for safety reasons			0
" we wo n't be doing that at the library , but awesome , " said librarian @entity270 , who will be integrating @entity7 into her summer program at the @entity272			1
@entity276 , 13 , is going to take part in the program for a second summer			1
inspired by last year , he 's been working on a remote - operated vehicle that goes underwater and has a mounted camera			0
he hopes to finish it in time for his family 's summer vacation so he can drop it into @entity287 in north - central @entity225			2
" i want to see if there are any catfish down there , " he said			0
wherever the campers are tuning in from , participation is key			0
" this is definitely not computer camp			2
we do n't want kids sitting in front of their computer , " said @entity295 , the @entity7 education lead			1
" i 'm always so sad about the kids spending their summer looking at a screen			2
we want them to go outside ! "			0

the @entity7 kicks off its online summer camp for teens on july 8
the camp is conducted over @entity47 and *focuses* on @entity122 projects
organizers hope the program will stimulate interest in technology , math and science
