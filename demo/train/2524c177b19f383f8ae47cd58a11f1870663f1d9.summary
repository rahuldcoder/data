how many ways can political reporters , pundits and book reviewers write that @entity5 's memoir " @entity6 " is devoid of salacious details or titillatingly news ? many , apparently			1
@entity9 , @entity10 's chief political correspondent , wrote that it was " risk - free telling of @entity18 's world travels " and @entity12 , a @entity13 @entity12 pundit , described it as " 50 shades of boring			1
" the @entity20 book review was even more stark : " there is little news in the book			0
" @entity18 's book is a thorough retelling of her time as @entity28 's top diplomat , not a salacious tell - all written by somebody who is done with a life in the public sphere			1
in a methodical way , @entity18 chronicles her time as secretary of state by jumping from hot spot to hot spot , describing each detailed problem as , quite expectedly , a " hard choice			1
" one of the most telling aspects of the book , however , is what 's not in it			2
here are the five things that are noticeably absent -- or not discussed in detail -- within the 656 pages of @entity18 's " @entity6			1
" @entity5 by the numbers 1			2
gossip : former secretary of defense @entity47 used his tell - all memoir " duty " earlier this year to blast many of his former colleagues			2
he wrote that vice president @entity54 " has been wrong on nearly every major foreign policy and national security issue over the past four decades " and described president @entity56 's administration as distrustful and suspicious of military leaders			0
the book was a way for the oft - subdued @entity60 to settle a few scores with @entity62 as he left to take over the @entity64			1
@entity18 's book is not at all like that			1
it is careful , measured and thoroughly devoid of backbiting			0
sure , @entity18 describes @entity70 president @entity69 as a " thin - skinned and autocratic " and former @entity74 president @entity73 as an " aloof chairman of the board , " but most of the time @entity18 describes people in more diplomatic , less derisive terms			1
@entity69 on @entity18 : ' it 's better not to argue with women ' instead of a tell - all , @entity18 's book serves as a tome to diplomacy			1
she sums this up in her chapter on @entity83 in which she writes , " engagement and pressure			0
this is the nature of diplomacy			0
" and she sums up the lack of gossip in the book 's " author 's note , " which was released weeks before the book came out			2
" while my views and experiences will surely be scrutinized by followers of @entity62 's long - running soap opera -- who took what side , who opposed whom , who was up and who was down -- i did n't write the book for them			1
that 's the number of times @entity18 writes about the controversial pipeline , a 1,179 - mile - long project that would move oil from @entity116 to refineries in the @entity28			1
the pipeline has been a hot button issue since it was first proposed in 2008 and more recently as @entity56 and current secretary of state @entity120 mull whether to approve the project			0
effort to approve @entity110 collapses in the @entity122 @entity123 have seized on the issue and have hammered democrats for not approving what they argue is a way to stimulate jobs			2
environmental groups contend that the pipeline would be harmful for the environment and just deepen the @entity28 ' dependence on fossil fuels			0
though @entity18 devotes a chapter of her book to energy and jobs and another to climate change , the pipeline goes unmentioned in both			1
@entity18 writes in a chapter titled " @entity142 : we 're all in this together " that " @entity28 's ability to lead in this setting hinges on what we ourselves are willing to do at home " " the problems posed by global warming were evident , despite the deniers , " @entity18 notes			1
" there was a mountain of overwhelming scientific data about the damaging effects of carbon dioxide , methane , and other greenhouse gases			0
" @entity18 has been hesitant to talk about @entity110 since she left @entity160			1
at a march event in @entity162 , @entity18 declined to comment on the ongoing debate over the pipeline because she said it would be unfair to @entity120 , who is currently handling the @entity110 question			1
" she said it just would n't be appropriate to comment			0
she choose her words really carefully , " said @entity169 , the organizer who introduced @entity18 at the closed - to - the - press event			2
@entity18 's @entity172 was tasked with overeeing whether to approve the pipeline and in a 2010 speech to the @entity175 in @entity176 , @entity18 said she was " inclined " to approve it , according to the @entity178			1
@entity179 and @entity180 : @entity18 gets into very little depth when it comes to @entity180 , the former contractor at the @entity179 who obtained and helped publish troves of documents that have shed light and raised questions about @entity28 surveillance practices			2
@entity180 and the @entity179 have been one of the biggest national security issues over the last year , but in her memoir , @entity18 devotes only a few pages to the debate and mentions @entity180 only three times			2
" his leaks revealed some of @entity28 's most sensitive classified intelligence programs , " @entity18 writes before discussing what @entity180 revealed and some of the questions he raised			2
after a few paragraphs , though , @entity18 finds herself somewhere between liberty and security and without answering a number of those questions on domestic surveillance			2
" with liberty and security , it 's not that the more you have of one , the less you have of the other			0
in fact i believe they make each other possible , " @entity18 concludes			0
" without security , liberty is fragile			0
without liberty , security is oppressive			0
the challenge is finding the proper measure : enough security to safeguard our freedoms , but not so much ( or so little ) as to endanger them			0
" a year after @entity180 , the real costs of @entity179 surveillance 4			0
@entity219 : in the weeks before the book 's release , the @entity18 @entity172 's failure to designate the tribal group that captured more than 200 schoolgirls in april as a terrorist organization was big news			1
on @entity18 's watch , the @entity172 -- at the urging of a number of experts on @entity230 and @entity219 -- decided not to list the group as a foreign terrorist organization , but @entity120 , her successor , designated the group as a terrorist organization in november 2013			1
republicans seized on @entity18 's decision , especially after a @entity240 article raised the issue			1
but @entity18 only mentions @entity230 once and never mentions @entity219			1
she notes , in a short story about @entity230 , that " corruption was the major impediment to growth in most of @entity247 , " including @entity230 , but does n't mention the terrorism that has ravaged the oil - rich nation 's eastern territories			2
the omission is noteworthy because @entity18 has made extensive comments about @entity219 since may			1
how national @entity123 plan to talk about @entity18 's book 5			1
any more certainty on 2016 : @entity18 waits 595 pages until she references the possibility that she will run for president in 2016 and then only repeats how she commonly answers the question			0
" will i run for president in 2016 ? " she asks			0
" the answer is , i have n't decided yet			0
" " right now i believe we should be focused on the work to be done in our country that ca n't wait until 2016			0
" she then writes about a walk that she and @entity18 took where they talked about the future			0
" we both know i have a big decision in front of me , " @entity18 writes			2
" ultimately , what happens in 2016 should be about what kind of future @entity28 want for themselves and their children - and grandchildren			0
i hope we choose inclusive politics and a common purpose to unleash the creativity , potential , and opportunity that makes @entity28 exceptional			0
that 's what all @entity28 deserve			0
" @entity18 became more open to talking about 2016 as her book 's release date neared			1
while in january 2013 she told a questioner that she was " not thinking about anything like that right now , " she told @entity291 earlier this month that she knows she has " a decision to make			0
" @entity5 talks @entity293 , @entity294 and her record @entity5 in 2001 : we were ' dead broke ' ' @entity6 ' recalls memories , regrets from @entity18 's state years			1

@entity5 's memoir is a retelling of her time at @entity172
she says that she did n't write for " followers of @entity62 's long - running soap opera "
while @entity18 has spoken extensively about @entity219 , group is absent from book
@entity18 also avoids controversial @entity110 pipeline , which still awaits a decision
