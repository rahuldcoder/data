@entity0 -- leaders of the different branches of the @entity5 armed forces gave sharply divergent answers to the @entity7 on friday when asked whether the military 's controversial " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy should be repealed , and what the consequences of a repeal might be			1
they appeared united , however , in their belief that a repeal would be better handled if ordered by congressional legislation rather than a ruling from the courts			1
the strongest resistance to allowing gays and lesbians to serve openly came from @entity22 gen. @entity21 , who warned of potentially strong repercussions in terms of unit cohesion			1
" if the law is changed , successfully implementing repeal and assimilating openly homosexual @entity28 into the tightly woven fabric of our combat units has strong potential for disruption at the small unit level , as it will no doubt divert leadership attention away from an almost singular focus of preparing units for combat , " @entity21 told the committee members			2
army chief of staff gen. @entity40 said a repeal of the policy could be implemented with a " moderate risk to our military effectiveness and the long - term health of the force			1
" " i believe the law should be repealed eventually , " he said , but the question " is one of timing			0
" @entity40 said he " would not recommend going forward at this time , given everything the @entity53 has on its plate			0
" air force chief of staff gen. @entity55 said he believes the law should be repealed " at some point ... perhaps 2012 " but it would not be prudent to pursue " full implementation ( of a repeal ) in the near - term			2
" chief of naval operations adm. @entity60 recommended a repeal of the policy , noting that 76 % of sailors are either neutral or feel positively about a repeal of " do n't ask , do n't tell			1
" coast guard commandant adm. @entity65 noted that a majority of members in his branch of the service appeared not have a problem with a repeal , but that " prudence dictates " proceeding with caution			1
gen. @entity74 , the vice chairman of the joint chiefs of staff , said he believes implementation of a repeal would involve a " manageable risk with regard to military effectiveness			2
" even in light of the wars in @entity83 and @entity84			0
in fact , @entity74 argued , the ongoing conflicts may make a repeal of the policy easier			1
during a conflict , members of the military " rely on the warrior ethos " of their fellow soldiers , and lifestyle concerns are diminished			0
the service chiefs were summoned to testify in the wake of a newly released @entity97 study which concluded that allowing openly gay or lesbian troops to serve in the military would have little lasting impact on the @entity5 armed forces			2
opposition to the change , however , appeared to be much higher in @entity53 and @entity28 combat units than in the military as a whole			2
@entity108 sen. @entity107 , the committee 's top @entity109 , said at friday 's hearing that the divergent military opinions reinforced his view that more debate is warranted			1
he also predicted that 41 other senators -- enough to prevent the issue from coming up for a final @entity7 vote -- would oppose legislation repealing " @entity119			1
" " our economy is in the tank and the @entity5 people want that issue addressed , " @entity107 said , referencing @entity109 demands to extend the @entity122 tax cuts before @entity123 tackles other issues			1
" and the military is functioning in the most efficient , most professional , most courageous fashion than at any time in our history			0
... we should n't be exercising a rush to judgment			2
" but @entity136 sen. @entity135 , the @entity137 chairman of the committee , said he remains a staunch of advocate of a repeal of " do n't ask , do n't tell			1
" @entity135 said there was greater resistance to allowing gays and lesbians to serve openly in the @entity147 and @entity148 militaries than there is in @entity5 armed forces today			0
but now , he noted , gays and lesbians are allowed to serve openly in both countries , and there has been " no evidence " of diminished combat effectiveness as a result			0
one key @entity109 moderate -- @entity158 sen. @entity157 -- announced his intention friday to support a repeal			1
" when a soldier answers the call to serve , and risks life or limb , it has never mattered to me whether they are gay or straight , " @entity157 said			1
" having reviewed the @entity97 report , having spoken to active and retired military service members , and having discussed the matter privately with defense secretary ( @entity65 ) @entity170 and others , i accept the findings of the report and support repeal based on ( @entity170 ' ) recommendations that repeal will be implemented only when the battle effectiveness of the forces is assured and proper preparations have been completed			1
" president @entity180 , @entity182 chairman adm. @entity181 and @entity170 all support a repeal of the policy			1
@entity181 told the @entity7 thursday that he believes that even among those combat forces , a transition to a new law is possible			0
" should repeal occur , some soldiers and @entity28 may want separate shower facilities			2
some may ask for different berthing			0
some may even quit the service			2
we 'll deal with that			0
but i believe , and history tells , that most of them will put aside personal proclivities for something larger than themselves and for each other , " he said			0
with just weeks left for this @entity123 , the calendar could be the biggest factor weighing on whether the law is repealed or upheld			0
the @entity204 has already approved the repeal			2
now , with @entity209 hearings over , senate majority leader @entity206 , @entity207 , must decide whether to keep legislative language calling for a repeal in a larger defense authorization bill or strip it off for a separate vote			1
despite @entity107 's assertions , some @entity137 have expressed cautious optimism they can find the 60 votes needed to overcome a potential @entity7 @entity109 filibuster against the measure			1
gay rights groups are pressuring @entity137 leaders to find a way to pass the repeal before the end of the year			1
once more conservative @entity109 take over the @entity204 and pick up several seats in the @entity7 in january , there will be little chance to change the current policy , they warn			0
@entity109 calls for more debate , many of them argue , are little more than another way to kill the measure			0
" i think given the testimony by members of the military that they still have serious reservations about repealing ' @entity119 , ' @entity137 have to be very concerned about the chances for a full repeal this session , " said @entity232 , a @entity234 political scientist			1
" the last thing they need , and more acutely the last thing president @entity180 needs , is a long protracted filibuster by the @entity109 on this issue to close out the lame duck session			0
" a top congressional analyst , the @entity250 's @entity249 , said that there are likely enough votes in the @entity7 to repeal " do n't ask , do n't tell " and that " the only hurdle , and it 's a big one , is time			1
" " @entity259 takes a lot of time and this is only one of many issues on the plate of the lame duck , " said @entity249 , referring to the procedure by which the @entity7 ends debate on legislation			0
" if it goes over to the next @entity123 , it will likely take a serious threat of judicial action against ( do n't ask , do n't tell ) to get it to move			0
" @entity232 contended that , for supporters of a repeal , " what is daunting is the real possibility that ' do n't ask , do n't tell ' falls victim to presidential politics			2
" " given a choice between emphasizing and winning policy battles on the economy and allowing gays to serve openly in the military , the good money bet is on the economy , " she said			0
" if @entity180 is worried about getting independents and moderate @entity137 back into the fold for 2012 , he may give up the fight only because that core constituency will want to see all of his energy devoted to the economy and not distracted by what the public sees as essentially a gay rights issue			0
" but on the other hand , @entity232 pointed out , " what 2010 showed is that if the @entity137 base stays home , @entity180 ca n't win re-election			0
so how tied is the @entity137 base to repealing the @entity298 ' policy ? that is the $ 64,000 question			2
" @entity1 's @entity301 contributed to this report			0
