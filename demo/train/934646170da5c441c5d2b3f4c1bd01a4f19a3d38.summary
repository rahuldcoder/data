-- ten years ago , president @entity1 of @entity2 faced an embarrassing foreign policy defeat			1
assisted by @entity2 's ablest spin doctors , @entity1 's favored candidate , @entity4 , had won @entity7 's presidential election , or at least had won the count			1
but thousands of protesters , alleging electoral fraud , surrounded government buildings , camping in the snow and waving orange flags			0
eventually , @entity1 's @entity7 allies capitulated			1
the @entity15 called another round of voting , and voters dumped @entity4 in favor of a politician , @entity20 , who called for @entity7 's rapid admission to @entity22			1
in the winters of 2006 and 2009 , gas supplies from the @entity2 company @entity24 were temporarily halted over payment disputes , but these were quickly resolved			1
within a few years , self - destructive squabbling among @entity7 's new democratic leaders , as the economy stagnated , had discredited the " @entity30			1
" @entity1 found he could actually get along quite well with @entity20 's main rival , @entity32			1
skip ahead ten years and @entity4 , elected president in a reasonably free election in 2010 , again finds himself facing angry crowds in @entity37 's @entity36 , or " @entity36			1
" this time the protesters demand he sign an association agreement with the @entity40 that @entity1 has opposed			1
as before , @entity1 makes clear his disdain for the demonstrators and his support for @entity4			1
yet , when his client is forced out of office , this time -- after violent street fighting between heavily armed @entity49 riot police and protesters hurling stones and @entity53 cocktails -- @entity1 does not sit on his hands			2
over the course of a few days , @entity2 troops occupy the key points in @entity7 's predominantly @entity2 - speaking @entity59 peninsula			1
the invasion sets off the most serious international crisis in @entity62 since the turn of the 21st century			0
opinion : how @entity1 carries out power grab is @entity1 - 2014 the same person as @entity1 - 2004 ? why in such ostensibly similar crises did he react in radically different ways ? why take an enormous gamble when he could be sure the current democratic victors in @entity37 would self - destruct as quickly as the first crop ? he would have to swallow a short - run setback			1
but @entity1 could then indulge his schadenfreude watching liberal prime minister @entity75 tussle with nationalist leader @entity76 as @entity7 's economy melted down and the @entity40 and @entity78 prepared a financial aid package sure to offer too little , too late , and only under stringent conditions			1
within a few years , a more @entity82 administration was likely to emerge			0
by contrast , @entity2 troops in @entity59 was the one thing certain to unite @entity37 's factions , mobilize @entity7 's population and prompt rapid @entity89 action on economic aid			1
at the same time , military intervention promised a string of unwelcome repercussions : @entity89 sanctions , visa bans for members of the ruling elite , asset freezes , diplomatic embarrassments , even perhaps exclusion from the @entity101			0
for @entity2 , already facing a stagnant economy , such moves could only accelerate capital flight and scare international investors			2
even more perverse , invasion would throw away in one day two years ' worth of reputational capital , accumulated from a string of unexpected foreign policy successes			0
from isolation over @entity112 , @entity1 had managed to emerge as peacemaker in late 2013 , persuading @entity112 president @entity114 to pledge to surrender his chemical weapons			2
by granting asylum to @entity119 leaker @entity118 , the @entity2 president could claim -- implausibly -- to be on the side of citizen privacy and transparency			2
despite a chorus of gloom in the @entity89 press , the @entity123 had passed without terrorist attacks or other disasters and with @entity2 athletes dominating the medals count			2
is there a rational explanation for @entity1 's resort to arms in 2014 ? @entity89 analysts have been at a loss			1
to those who have been raising the alarm about @entity1 's expansionist drive and wounded pride since before he came to office , there is nothing to explain : the dictator has shown his true colors			2
yet this is hardly more informative than the stopped clock that is right twice a day			0
if @entity1 - 2014 was a militant expansionist , why did @entity1 - 2004 hold back ? what to make , then , of @entity149 who , when asked whether @entity2 might one day join @entity22 replied : " why not ? i do not rule out such a possibility			1
" later there was @entity1 - 2002 who said that the @entity155 states joining @entity22 was " no tragedy			2
" over the years , @entity1 acquiesced to @entity158 bases in @entity159 after 9/11 , shared intelligence with @entity161 , agreed to cut nuclear arsenals by two thirds , and defied his own @entity165 protesters to establish a route through @entity2 for @entity158 military supplies to @entity168			1
so what has changed ? most plausibly , @entity1 hopes to use the conflict to ignite nationalist pride and anger at home , building a new base of anti-western support for his leadership as he loses the backing based on economic performance			2
( with oil prices no longer rising , and global liquidity tighter since the 2008 financial crisis , @entity2 's growth slowed to just 1.3 percent last year			2
) if so , this is unlikely to work			0
in a poll one month ago , 73 percent of @entity2 opposed intervention in @entity7 's politics			1
comparable nationalist rallying points in the past such as @entity2 's 2008 invasion of @entity189 produced a spike in @entity1 's ratings , but one that had completely reversed within a few months			1
the costs of the @entity59 intervention , in reduced investment and international isolation , will last longer than the immediate rally behind the flag			1
so will the heightened tensions with other neighboring states that contain large @entity2 - speaking minorities , such as @entity201 and the @entity22 - members @entity203 and @entity204			2
opinion : @entity1 's endgame and why the @entity89 may have a hard time stopping him that after 14 years the leader of an increasingly authoritarian state should start to make mistakes is not surprising			1
such leaders tend to become trapped in an information bubble of their own creation			0
surrounding themselves with friends and colleagues with similar world views , they -- deliberately or unwittingly -- cut themselves off from unwelcome information			0
they forget that the media they have censored tells them only what they want to hear , and that the " experts " they have cultivated are those that reinforce their own prejudices			0
they start to believe the verdicts of the courts they have politicized			0
like all people but more so , they succumb to attribution bias -- believing the worst of others and the best of themselves -- and to the overconfidence effect -- the tendency to exaggerate the odds of success			0
the result is a distorted view of events that is self - serving and black and white			0
@entity244 chancellor @entity243 , who spoke to @entity1 by phone last sunday , said that he seemed to be " in another world			2
" the result can be decisions that put the leader 's own position at risk			0
gen. @entity253 , after ruling @entity252 for 15 years , came to believe he was extremely popular			0
to his dismay , a plebiscite he called in 1988 revealed that most @entity252 would rather have a different leader			0
other authoritarian leaders , such as @entity258 of @entity259 , have lost power after calling elections that they were sure they would win			1
although his regime faces no immediate danger , and the first polls may well show initial support for his moves , @entity1 has made his task of holding onto power in the medium run more difficult			2
business elites , both in and outside his circle , will resent the new instability and isolation the @entity59 operation has created			0
the @entity2 stock market fell almost 13 % on the first day after the invasion , and the @entity278 had to raise interest rates to stanch decline in the ruble			0
support for any intervention with economic and human costs is likely to drain away fast			0
yet , the information filter around @entity1 will make it hard for him to evaluate what is going on			0
rather than recognizing his own mistakes , he will tend to believe stories of betrayal and external hostility			0
unless the dissonance rises to such a level that it provokes a major rethink -- and he proves flexible enough to question his own action -- he is likely to continue miscalculating as the crisis unfolds			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity298 .			0

ten years ago , @entity1 tolerated a @entity7 uprising , *ultimately* seeing things go his way
@entity298 : why did @entity1 take the bold step of sending forces into @entity59 in 2014 ?
he says the costs will almost certainly *outweigh* the benefits for the @entity2
@entity298 : like many authoritarian leaders , @entity1 may now believe his own *rhetoric*
