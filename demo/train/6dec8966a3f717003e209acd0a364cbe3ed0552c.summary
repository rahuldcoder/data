-- @entity1 may top the @entity3 table going into 2014 , but @entity4 leads the way when it comes to post-match performances			1
after a hard - fought 2 - 1 win that kept his @entity10 team in touch with @entity1 and @entity12 ahead of the @entity3 's @entity14 program , @entity4 sought to deflect any possible criticism of his players with a blustering counter-attack			1
when questioned about key incidents in sunday 's match , which continued the tense clashes between the two teams in recent years , the @entity19 manager accused @entity24 of " an acrobatic swimming pool jump " and going down " like somebody shot him			1
" this was after @entity10 's match - winner @entity29 had clearly body - checked the 19 - goal striker off the ball inside his own penalty area while @entity34 cleared the ball			1
" @entity24 lost a duel with @entity38 ... and now he 's doing an acrobatic swimming pool jump to try to get the penalty , because he 's so clever because he 's in the area where the @entity43 supporters are behind , " @entity4 insisted at his press conference			2
" but ( referee @entity45 ) @entity44 is 10 meters away			0
and i think the only mistake @entity44 did was not to give him a yellow card			0
" @entity24 has a reputation of going to ground too easily , but this season the @entity49 has been a reformed man -- being named interim captain by @entity43 manager @entity52 -- following last season 's eight - match ban for biting @entity10 's @entity55			1
" the player is amazing , " acknowledged @entity4 , who has yet to suffer a home league defeat in his two spells at @entity58			0
" he does everything to win and @entity52 is doing a fantastic job on him because he 's changed			0
there 's no doubt that he 's changed			0
" but when the situation is like this and you are losing comes the nature of the player , the wild nature of the player or the cultural nature of the player			0
" culturally people from that area ( @entity76 ) , they like it			0
it 's not also that area			0
there 's a corner in @entity81 where i belong to , that they also like diving			0
" @entity52 , meanwhile , was aggrieved that @entity29 was still on the pitch following a high tackle on @entity87 that provided the free - kick for @entity90 's early opening goal -- the defender pounced from close range after @entity55 tussled with @entity24			1
@entity93 leveled with a superb curling effort , and @entity29 poked in a 34th - minute winner from @entity97 's low cross			1
" he should 've been sent off , " @entity52 said of the @entity99 striker			0
" i know we scored from it , but that was a wild challenge , where he 's raked down his knee and down his shin and did n't even get a yellow card			0
" @entity24 will always provoke a challenge from defenders , that 's why he 's world - class			2
what he probably does n't expect is to provoke a challenge from someone who 's not involved in the contact			0
" he 's running to challenge @entity34 and @entity29 is streetwise , he 's cute , he blocks him			2
on another day you could give that as a penalty , because it 's obstruction in the area			0
" @entity52 was measured in his comments after being charged by the @entity121 for criticizing match officials following @entity43 's 2 - 1 defeat by @entity12 on thursday			1
his team topped the table last weekend , but a second straight reverse left the @entity127 in fifth place -- six points behind @entity1 , and four adrift of third - placed @entity10			1
the team leading going into the new year has won the title for seven of the past nine years , though @entity1 was one of the exceptions in 2007 - 08 , dropping back to third			2
the @entity137 side was missing record signing @entity138 and top scorer @entity140 for sunday 's trip to in - form @entity142 , but battled to a vital 1 - 0 victory thanks to @entity145 's eighth league goal this season			1
the @entity148 striker glanced in @entity150 's 65th - minute free - kick to inflict @entity142 's first league defeat since october			2
" there is something in the team that is special on the mental front , " said @entity1 manager @entity152			2
" we have many times been questioned , but we have shown that at @entity159 , where we were 1 - 0 down , we have shown that again today , where we were a bit backs - to - the - wall in the last 15 minutes			1
" last year in this period , we were out of the championship race , but in 2013 , we have been quite consistent			0
" @entity1 's win allowed @entity137 rival @entity165 to move up to seventh place above @entity142 with a 3 - 0 win at home to 12th - placed @entity170 , as @entity172 striker @entity171 netted a penalty before @entity176 midfielder @entity175 and @entity177 winger @entity174 added the others			1
@entity179 climbed above @entity180 rival @entity43 into fourth with a 2 - 1 win at home to ninth - placed @entity183 , as on - loan @entity10 striker @entity184 struck the 74th - minute winner -- the @entity176 international 's ninth in the league this season .			1

third - placed @entity10 two points behind @entity1 after beating @entity43 2 - 1
@entity29 scores winning goal , having helped @entity43 's opener with foul
@entity1 top of the table following sunday 's 1 - 0 victory at @entity142
@entity179 in fourth above @entity43 after winning 2 - 1 against @entity183
