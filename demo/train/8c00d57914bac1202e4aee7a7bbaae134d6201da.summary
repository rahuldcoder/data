@entity0 , @entity1 -- you must know what 's really driving the immigration debate			0
it 's the culture , stupid			2
@entity7 : some opponents of immigration , even the legal kind , fear changes in local culture			1
immigration restrictionists -- and by that , i mean those who want to limit all immigration , even the legal kind -- like to pretend they 're so high - minded			0
yet they ca n't help themselves			0
they always take the low road and harken back to the nativism that greeted earlier waves of immigrants			2
the restrictionists insist that what bothers them are merely practical concerns : that our borders are n't secure , that so many immigrants are coming into the country illegally , and that the new arrivals are burdening schools and draining social services once they get here			2
really ? if that 's the extent of it , then why does the conversation quickly turn to the impact -- both real and perceived -- that immigrants have on @entity39 culture through everything from taco trucks to @entity43 - language billboards			1
that seems to be the issue in @entity46 , where , according to a recent article in @entity50 , towns facing tough economic times are nonetheless resisting a cultural transfusion that could save them			0
in @entity54 , the locals opposed efforts to bring in a hog plant and a dairy , because those kind of dirty and hard jobs are likely to attract ... guess who ? @entity39 kids who work at @entity63 ? nope			1
the article quotes @entity65 , a local community leader in @entity54 , who says that some residents have told him " face to face " that such facilities might attract @entity71 immigrants who could change the local culture			1
you 'll find the same fear in @entity76 , @entity77			2
not long ago , an employee at a local library came up with the radical idea of a bilingual story time where children could hear tales read to them in @entity43			2
townspeople wanted no part of that			0
they demanded that all books purchased by the library , or even donated , be in @entity89 - only			1
these stories are ridiculous , but they 're also helpful			0
they illustrate what some people are really concerned about with immigration , and it goes well beyond words like " legal " or " illegal			0
" it 's the perception that the country is becoming more @entity71 , that @entity43 is replacing @entity89 , that @entity71 immigrants are weakening @entity39 identity , and that @entity100 is turning into @entity101			1
a leader of the vigilante @entity104 movement moronically called it the " colonization " of the @entity39			1
this sort of rhetoric is all about fear -- that those who thrive in the dominant culture are losing their primacy , that the mainstream is being polluted by foreigners , and that our children are going to live in a world where they 're going to have to work a lot harder to keep up			0
it conjures up the alarm bells that @entity122 set off about @entity124 immigrants in the late 18th century , who he insisted could never adopt the culture of the @entity89 , but would " swarm into our settlements , and by herding together establish their @entity127 to the exclusion of ours			1
" it popped up in the mid- 19th century amid worries that @entity132 immigrants were " unassimilable , " which led to @entity134 approving the explicitly - named @entity135 of 1882			0
and it helped welcome the 20th century when @entity138 sen. @entity137 warned that immigrants ( read : the @entity140 ) were diluting " the quality of ( @entity39 ) citizenship " and others complained that @entity143 immigrants were uneducated , low skilled , apt to send all their money to their home country and prone to criminal activity			1
where have we heard that before ? and when will we hear it again ? after all , @entity151 may be the latest group to find themselves in a culture war with nativists			1
but they wo n't be the last			0
