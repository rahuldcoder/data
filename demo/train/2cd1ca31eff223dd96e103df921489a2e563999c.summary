-- recently , @entity1 told @entity2 that @entity3 is not cool with itself			1
speaking at the home of @entity7 executive @entity6 , he looked into the eyes of stars like @entity10 and @entity11 and said that the country is full of " disquiet , " that the future risks " more cynicism , more dysfunction , " and that " we have a @entity18 that 's not working			0
" in the distance , a car alarm went off			0
the president quipped , " sound the alarm , because we 've got a problem			0
" there was a lot of predictable gloom in those remarks , given the president 's low approval rating , but also a surprising lack of self - awareness			0
if @entity1 has proved to be a disappointment then @entity2 is partly responsible for all the unrealistic ambitions that have surrounded him			1
and there 's big irony in the fact that he is now seeking comfort from the very liberal elite that he once seemed to challenge			1
back in the 2008 @entity42 primaries , @entity2 was solid @entity43 country ; it only rallied to @entity1 after he snagged the nomination			1
after he won the @entity47 , there were two years of mutual snub between @entity49 and @entity18 not only did some moviemakers gripe that the president was a reluctant reformer ( remember @entity53 or @entity54 or remind yourself of when @entity1 was still anti-gay marriage ) , but he rarely called people to say " thank you " for everything they 've done for him			1
@entity2 might tolerate inaction , but it ca n't abide the absence of flattery			2
so how did @entity1 change his mind about @entity2 ? the change occurred thanks to the rise of the tea party , which galvanized @entity70 liberals , and the president 's sudden conversion to the legalization of gay marriage , which happen to come at a time when local reports indicated that his @entity2 money was in danger of drying up			1
almost overnight , @entity2 assumed a structural importance in his re-election campaign to rival that of organized labor , liberal pacs or even the @entity85			1
here 's another irony : @entity2 benefited from the changes to campaign finance that many stars protested against			1
@entity90 allowed moviemakers to act as bundlers , buying them new levels of access and influence			0
this corresponded with a subtle change in the way that @entity1 was sold to the voter			2
in 2008 , he was the outsider offering change ( although the famous " @entity103 " video was a 100 % @entity2 product produced by @entity106 's son , @entity105 )			1
come 2012 , he now represented various faces of liberal authority -- many of them defined by @entity2 archetypes			1
for example , there was an experiment in reinventing @entity1 as @entity115 , the lawyer played by @entity117 in " to kill a mockingbird			2
" @entity1 gave a televised introduction to the movie on the @entity122 channel in 2012			2
film critic @entity123 noted that @entity1 wanted the viewer to imagine that he was " cut from exactly the same liberal oak as @entity117 's @entity115 ( retrenching ) @entity1 's status as the defender of the mainstream			1
" defender , too , of law and order			0
for the release of " @entity133 , " the @entity47 publicized a photo of @entity1 and @entity135 with the tagline , " @entity144 , " capitalizing upon the plotline of a caped crusader protecting an @entity3 city against a greedy villain who bore almost the same name to the company that @entity143 set up -- @entity146 / @entity145			2
and once the election was over , the first movie that @entity1 showed in the @entity47 was @entity154 's " @entity153 , " with its equally prescient synopsis of a president who overcomes partisan divisions to bring social justice to @entity3			1
" i never compared myself to @entity153 " , @entity1 told @entity155 on " @entity156			2
" but he did film a metajoke for the @entity158 in which he played @entity159 preparing to play @entity1 in a biopic spoof of @entity153			2
alas , @entity1 is no @entity153			0
@entity161 may have had the power to make the opposition vote his way , but when @entity1 invited congressional republicans to attend the showing of @entity154 's movie , not one of them turned up			1
when the president threw a barbecue for newly elected @entity173 , only one third showed , and @entity174 has set a record for dodging state dinners			0
once , @entity1 eschewed connection with the @entity2 liberal establishment			1
now he relies upon it for money , for selling @entity181 to voters and -- most importantly -- for helping to define a shifting image of what he wants his presidency to be			0
there is nothing unusual in this			0
@entity189 used @entity190 to define his foreign policy , @entity194 's @entity193 swagger was pure @entity2 invention			1
but this kind of celluloid fantasy - making is far from healthy			0
@entity198 is n't a place that can be navigated by idealism ; a dangerous world can not be managed with superhero theatrics ( such as drone strikes )			0
expectations are raised excessively by promising to solve all these problems with the same ease that they do in the movies			0
moreover , talking in @entity209 © s encourages partisanship			0
while the @entity42 cling to being @entity211 , the @entity212 see themselves as men with no name -- and there 's little common ground that can be reached between people competing to be more stubbornly archetypal than the rest			0
where do you retreat to when your policies fail and the partisanship grows deafening ? your base			0
after a term and a half of promising to be a different kind of @entity227 , to change things , to reshape politics for ordinary people -- @entity1 finds himself seeking comfort in the audience of old - fashioned , dare i say " fading , " liberal stars like @entity10			2
@entity2 might still imagine him to be a superhero , but @entity1 has really become the thing that in 2008 he set out to avoid : another @entity43 @entity227 .			1

@entity237 : if @entity1 is a disappointment , @entity2 is partly to blame
@entity237 : @entity1 used to challenge or snub the *celebrity* liberal elite
he says it 's ironic that @entity1 needs their help now , for money and for image
@entity237 : @entity2 might still imagine him to be a superhero , but there 's reality
