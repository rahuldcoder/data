a vein on an @entity3 inmate " exploded " in the middle of his execution tuesday , prompting authorities to abruptly halt the process and call off another execution later in the day as they try to figure out what went wrong			2
the inmate , @entity14 , died 43 minutes after the first injection was administered -- according to reporter @entity16 of @entity1 affiliate @entity17 who witnessed the ordeal -- of an apparent heart attack , @entity13 director @entity12 said			1
that first drug , midazolam , is supposed to render a person unconscious			0
seven minutes later , @entity14 was still conscious			1
about 16 minutes in , after his mouth and then his head moved , he seemingly tried to get up and tried to talk , saying " man " aloud , according to the @entity17 account			1
other reporters -- including @entity28 of the @entity30 newspaper -- similarly claimed that @entity14 was " still alive , " having lifted his head while prison officials lowered the blinds at that time so that onlookers could n't see what was going on			1
@entity36 , @entity14 's attorney , said that he saw his client 's body start " to twitch ( and ) he mumbled something			1
" then " the convulsing got worse , it looked like his whole upper body was trying to lift off the gurney			0
" yet the office of @entity3 gov. @entity46 issued a statement indicating " execution officials said @entity14 remained unconscious after the lethal injection drugs were administered			1
" after the ordeal , @entity12 told reporters that @entity14 , a convicted murderer , had been sedated and then was given the second and third drugs in protocol			1
" there was some concern at that time that the drugs were not having the effect , so the doctor observed the line and determined that the line had blown , " he said , before elaborating that @entity14 's vein had " exploded			1
" " i notified the attorney general 's office , the governor 's office of my intent to stop the execution and requested a stay for 14 days for the second execution scheduled this afternoon , " said @entity12 , referring to the execution of @entity64			0
@entity72 , a spokeswoman for the state attorney general 's office , said tuesday night that her office was " gathering information on what happened in order to evaluate			2
" the state 's governor ordered an investigation and issued an executive order granting a 2 - week delay in executions			2
" i have asked the @entity85 to conduct a full review of @entity3 's execution procedures to determine what happened and why during this evening 's execution of @entity90 , " @entity46 said in a statement			0
the constitutionality of lethal injection drugs and drug cocktails has made headlines since last year , when @entity96 manufacturers -- including @entity98 - based @entity97 , which manufactures pentobarbital -- banned @entity101 prisons from using their drugs in executions			1
thirty - two states were left to find new drug protocols			0
opinion : end secrecy in lethal injections according to the @entity13 , its protocol includes midazolam , which causes unconsciousness , vecuronium bromide , which stops respiration , and potassium chloride , which is meant to stop the heart			2
@entity14 was convicted in 2000 of a bevy of crimes , including first - degree murder , first - degree rape , kidnapping and robbery in a 1999 home invasion and crime spree that left @entity125 dead and two people injured			1
his final moments gave new life , at least temporarily , to @entity64			0
@entity64 was convicted in 2003 for the first - degree rape and murder six years earlier of his then - girlfriend 's 11 - month - old daughter , @entity131			0
the state decided to put off his execution set for tuesday			2
but it has given no indication this delay will be indefinite despite calls from the likes of @entity140 , co-chair of the @entity141 to abolish the @entity142 , who accused the state of having " tortured a human being in an unconstitutional experimental act of evil			2
" " tonight , our state government has acted in sin and violated @entity151 's law , " @entity140 said			1
" we will pray for their souls			0
" notably , @entity14 and @entity64 -- who were both held at the @entity154 in @entity155 -- had been at the center of a court fight over the drugs used in their execution			1
they 'd initially challenged the state @entity13 ' unwillingness to divulge which drugs would be used , only for the department to budge and disclosed the substances			2
but @entity14 and @entity64 did n't stop there , taking issue with the state 's so - called secrecy provision forbidding it from disclosing the identities of anyone involved in the execution process or suppliers of any drugs or medical equipment			1
@entity3 's high court initially issued stays on their executions , only to lift those stays last week in ruling the two men had no right to know the source of the drugs intended to kill them			0
@entity64 's attorney , @entity185 , said that further legal action can be expected given how " something went horribly awry " tuesday			0
" @entity3 can not carry out further executions until there 's transparency in this process , " @entity185 said			0
" ... i think they should all be looking at themselves hard			0
@entity3 needs to take a step back			0
" death penalty @entity196 death penalty in the @entity101 gradually declining @entity1 's @entity199 and @entity200 contributed to this report .			0
