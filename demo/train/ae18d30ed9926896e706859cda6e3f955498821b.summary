-- as the powerhouses of the rugby world continue to battle over the @entity4 trophy in the knockout stages of the @entity6 , some of the sport 's less - fancied teams are making their way home after a valiant , if unsuccessful , fight in the group stages			1
since the tournament began in 1987 , only four nations have walked away as world champions : @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19			2
@entity20 's @entity20 , @entity22 's @entity21 or the @entity24 @entity23 were never the bookmakers ' favorites to win the @entity6 and for obvious reasons			1
these emerging nations do not compete anywhere near as regularly as the elite sides and , along with tactical and experience deficiencies , face a daunting challenge to emerge from the bruising challenge of the pool matches in the world 's most prestigious event			1
but these teams do have heart and motivation and -- perhaps most of all -- they have the joy and passion of national pride			1
whether or not they walk away with wins , it 's being there , representing their nations and improving the standard of rugby within their countries , that matters most for them			2
" when that flag is waving and the anthem plays before the game , if that does n't get you going , you need to see a cardiologist , " former @entity23 player and coach @entity55 told @entity0			1
" it 's just one of those moments where you feel not only a lot of responsibility , but you feel really privileged to have that responsibility			2
" lelos making strides @entity22 did not make an appearance in the @entity6 until 2003 , but the they became an overnight sensation during that year 's tournament with their passionate play , despite not actually winning a match			1
the @entity68 , named after an indigenous @entity22 sport similar to rugby , also qualified for the 2007 finals and nearly caused a sensation by coming within a whisker of beating established nation @entity80			1
just 11 days later , they beat @entity82 30 - 0 to record their first @entity6 success			0
for a nation that considers rugby to be a minority sport , @entity22 are supported by an intensely loyal fan base and host a number of players who regularly compete in @entity89 , adding to their level of conditioning			1
" the strength of our team is in our physicality , " media manager @entity92 told @entity0			0
" we always have very good forwards and our scrum is considered to be in the top five in the world			2
our players have a very strong sense of pride and courage			2
they play like they are on a battlefield protecting their country			0
" @entity22 qualified for this year 's tournament after defeating @entity109 36 - 8 and winning the @entity110 in 2010			1
" we are determined to show the world that we are not underdogs , " @entity92 added			2
" we want to prove that we deserve a place among the elite teams			0
we aim more at playing with dignity rather than winning , however , to win one or two matches is very important because expectations are very high here in @entity22			1
" in this year 's tournament , @entity22 narrowly lost to @entity118 , @entity19 and @entity119 , but beat @entity120 25 - 7			1
" i think @entity22 surpassed expectations in this year 's @entity6 , " @entity121 , a @entity122 broadcaster who regularly covers rugby , told @entity0			1
" i would have expected them to have lost more heavily to @entity118 , @entity19 and @entity119 , given those teams would have been very aware of what @entity22 are capable of			1
@entity22 were not taken lightly by any of those teams , and yet still , the margins of victory were more than respectable for a side that does n't get that much competitive play			1
" @entity22 have come a long way in a short state of time , " @entity121 added			1
" if they can add a bit more creativity and flair behind what they 've got up front , then they will push forward			0
" eye on the @entity23 the @entity24 @entity23 have participated in each @entity6 since 1987 ( except 1995 , when they did not qualify ) , but going into this year 's @entity6 , they had only ever won only two matches , both against @entity145			1
although they are a national team , the @entity23 are not considered part of the professional game			1
the @entity24 players were exposed to rugby in high school or college and many are former @entity152 players			1
" these are regular people with normal jobs who have learned to challenge themselves outside the usual lifestyle , " @entity153 , coach of the @entity155 sevens side , told @entity0			0
" the majority of those players have come through the high school and college @entity163 system over the last 10 years			0
they finally have a pathway			0
it 's not just a bunch of guys saying ' hey , who wants to go represent the @entity24 in the @entity6 ? ' that was the mechanism 10 years ago			1
" while other countries were holding training camps in july , the @entity23 were unable to practice as a team , according to head coach @entity174			1
when the players do get together , they have to make up for lost time in addition to preparing for a global tournament			0
" it 's a pretty meager existence , but we make those sacrifices so we can get our proper training and conditioning in , " @entity23 center @entity178 told @entity0			1
" it 's a testament to the guys who are dedicated			0
everyone wants to be here and put their time in			0
" the main core of the current @entity24 squad played together in the 2007 tournament , and the players have managed to maintain a tight chemistry			1
that , combined with the pride they take in representing their country on a world stage , provides @entity155 with its greatest strengths			1
" the ultimate thing you want to do is represent your country , " @entity23 lock @entity202 told @entity0			2
" that 's the dream , the goal , the end result if you 're really committed to your sport			0
one of the things i 'm constantly impressed with is the chemistry on the team			0
physically you have a team here who is strong as any other team , but our commitment to each other is an asset			0
" the @entity23 fell to @entity80 and @entity225 , and were thrashed 67 - 5 by @entity18			2
however , they achieved an important goal by defeating @entity109 13 - 6 , a result that saw them finish fourth in @entity229 , ahead of the @entity109			0
" i would expect that they wanted to beat @entity109 by more , " @entity121 said			0
" the disappointing thing for them will be the hammering at the hands of @entity18			0
that is the kind of gap they will want to close in the future			0
they will be disappointed not to have made more of a statement at the @entity6 , but they showed that they 've got some really talented players			0
" @entity20 still improving @entity20 have appeared in every @entity6 since 1987 and have already qualified for the 2015 tournament			2
going into this year 's tournament , the @entity20 were the top qualifying @entity245 team and have continued to improve in rank throughout the year			2
but they have only made it past the pool phase once , in 1991 , where they were knocked out in the quarterfinals by @entity16			0
@entity20 entered this years tournament in good stead with victories over the @entity24 and maintained that form with a 25 - 20 success over @entity258			1
defeat against @entity89 followed , before a tense 23 - 23 draw against @entity145			0
former @entity20 international @entity260 told @entity0 : " they 've been really honest and hardworking in this tournament despite not everything being perfect			2
in terms of their attitude and setting up for the next four years , it 's been an outstanding @entity6			0
" @entity20 were thrashed 79 - 15 by host nation and tournament favorites @entity16 in their final match and @entity260 believes if the @entity20 want to improve on the international stage , they need to re-evaluate their structure , beginning with a bigger pool of players to choose from			2
" the biggest issue is we have is to be playing at a higher intensity , " he said			0
" we need more regular games at a higher level , so when we get to the pool games , the intensity and the mental preparation is n't quite as much of a shock to the system			0
" i 'd like to see us knocking on the door , like when @entity258 upset @entity89			0
i 'd like it if @entity20 could be that team upsetting other teams -- i think we can get up there to being at the top of the @entity293 nations			2
