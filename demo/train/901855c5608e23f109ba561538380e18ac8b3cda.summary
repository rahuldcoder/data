@entity0 -- 2010 has opened on an unsettling note for democrats in the @entity4			1
@entity6 's @entity5 and @entity8 's @entity7 -- two longtime power players in the chamber -- have announced their intention to step down at the end of the year			1
if history is any guide , the party now faces an uphill struggle to maintain its 60 - seat supermajority			1
failure to do so could have serious ramifications for president @entity20 as he tries to look past the health care debate and tackle global warming , ballooning budget deficits and a range of other politically contentious issues			0
the fight over health care reform has clearly demonstrated that 60 votes is now the minimum threshold for passing major legislation through the @entity4			1
anything less leaves the majority party at the mercy of a minority increasingly willing to employ the filibuster to grind the legislative gears of the @entity4 to a halt			0
@entity3 currently have exactly 60 members in their caucus ; @entity40 have 40			1
the @entity40 knows that presidents typically lose @entity43 and @entity4 seats during midterm elections , and is banking on that fact to block much of @entity20 's agenda			1
" midterm elections are usually low - turnout affairs , " noted @entity1 polling director @entity47			0
" conservative republicans , however , have been energized by their strong opposition to @entity20 's agenda			0
they 're likely to vote this november			0
many liberals , on the other hand , do n't feel @entity20 has pushed strong enough on their issues			1
it 's unclear at the moment if they 'll be as likely to show at the polls			0
" this year , @entity3 must defend 19 seats , including an opening that occurred when veteran @entity62 sen. @entity61 died			1
a special election for @entity61 's seat -- widely expected to be won by the @entity3 -- will take place january 19			2
@entity40 are defending 18 seats			2
the @entity40 , according to many analysts , is now placing a high priority on picking up @entity3 seats in @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity8 and @entity74			1
the @entity72 and @entity71 seats were once held by @entity20 and vice president @entity76 , respectively			1
@entity20 's replacement , sen. @entity78 , was immediately tainted after being tapped to fill @entity20 's vacancy by @entity80 , the state 's scandal - plagued former governor			2
@entity78 is not seeking election in his own right			0
@entity76 's replacement , sen. @entity87 , is likely to step aside in favor of the vice president 's son , delaware attorney general @entity89 , analysts believe			0
@entity71 's longtime @entity40 congressman , @entity91 , is being touted as the likely @entity40 nominee			0
senate majority leader @entity93 , @entity94 , is struggling to manage @entity20 's more progressive agenda while also seeking a fifth term from his traditionally conservative state			0
republicans , however , are having a tough time unifying behind an opponent			0
at the same time , five - term @entity74 sen. @entity101 remains a high - profile target for conservatives enraged by his decision to switch from the @entity40 to the @entity3 last year			1
before he can get to the general election , @entity101 will face a tough primary challenge from rep. @entity107 , a former admiral			0
also in the @entity40 's crosshairs is two - term @entity110 democrat @entity109 , who recently cast a tough political vote in favor of @entity93 's health care bill			2
@entity5 's decision to retire , however , is widely believed to be beneficial to @entity3 chances in largely liberal @entity6			1
the state 's popular @entity3 attorney general , @entity116 , declared his candidacy a few hours after @entity5 announced he was stepping down			1
@entity3 leaders , for their part , are placing a high priority on picking up @entity40 seats in @entity124 , @entity125 , @entity126 , and @entity127			1
republicans have been stung by incumbents ' decisions to retire in all four states			0
@entity132 , a more conservative state , has attracted the interest of @entity3 strategists			0
first - term @entity40 sen. @entity135 has been tarred by his 2007 admission that he had a relationship with a prostitute			2
this year 's race in @entity140 has also become an increasingly high - profile contest , largely due to @entity40 infighting			2
@entity40 sen. @entity143 , who was appointed to the @entity4 after former sen. @entity144 unexpectedly stepped down last year , is not seeking a full term			1
the state 's @entity40 governor , @entity146 , was widely expected to take the seat , but is now facing an unexpectedly strong conservative primary challenge from former @entity140 house speaker @entity150			2
@entity40 are still , however , favored to hold the seat			0
@entity1 's @entity151 and @entity152 contributed to this report .			0
