-- @entity1 , a 32 - year - old @entity2 photographer , wants to dispel the stereotypes he says many @entity5 hold about people from his home region -- an ethnically diverse province in @entity5 's far west			1
he traveled to more than 20 cities to interview and photograph more than 500 people as part of a photography project called " i 'm from @entity14 " that aims to bridge the gap between @entity5 's @entity18 majority and the predominantly @entity19 at a time of heightened tensions between the two groups			1
following the conviction of @entity2 extremists for a number of violent attacks in the past year , @entity1 told @entity0 that many @entity5 outside @entity14 increasingly associate the province with terrorism			1
" the idea occurred to me to tell the real life stories of people from @entity14 ... and show that people from @entity14 are no different from others , " he said			2
a new book will showcase 100 of his best portraits			0
they include @entity37 , a @entity39 - based uyghur lawyer , who is now studying for a master 's degree in comparative law at a @entity45 university and @entity46 , a @entity18 adopted by a @entity2 family , who runs a mobile phone business and has converted to @entity49			2
the subjects are shown in a variety of settings -- an office cubicle , praying , in a radio studio and at home , which @entity1 hopes will dispel a common perception that people from @entity14 only run kebab stalls or restaurants			1
most of the people he approached were willing to have their portraits taken , but some balked at the last minute			0
@entity1 , who is based in @entity65 and started taking photos in middle school , says he , like other @entity2 , has faced discrimination , particularly after knife - wielding assailants killed 31 people at train station in @entity72 earlier this year -- an attack @entity5 media referred to as the country 's 9/11			1
" during those days , i could n't even get a cab because i have a face typical of @entity14 people , " he said			2
@entity1 does n't expect his book to bring any significant changes but he hopes it will encourage others to understand the people from @entity14 they encounter in their daily life			1
ultimately , he says , he did the project " not for @entity2 , not for @entity14 , " but for himself			0
" if i do n't do this , the labels they put on @entity14 people will be put on me			0
i do n't want to be labeled			0
" @entity0 's @entity87 reported from @entity65 , @entity88 wrote from @entity89 .			0
