-- on saturday , " @entity5 " celebrates its historic 50th anniversary with a simulcast special in 75 countries			1
but it almost was n't to be			0
in 1989 , the show was canceled			2
a 1996 attempt to reboot it lasted as long as one tv movie			0
finally , in 2005 , the show was revived , and its fanbase has grown ever since			2
news of the 12th doctor , @entity14 , made worldwide headlines			0
fans of the doctor -- an alien " @entity18 " who travels across space and time -- are no longer relegated to fan sites and " @entity5 " conventions			1
the show is now a high point of each year 's @entity26 and prominently referenced on shows like " @entity28 " and " @entity29			1
" it 's also the no. 1 rated show on @entity32 and won a prestigious @entity33 this year			1
that 's quite an achievement for a show aimed at children that was quietly launched on november 23 , 1963			1
@entity37 , a producer " @entity5 " since 2011 , spoke to @entity0 about the show 's legacy and what fans can expect for the big 50th anniversary episode , " @entity42			1
" @entity0 : what do you think it is that has helped the show last 50 years , continuing to grow its fan base ? @entity37 : it 's a very simple premise , yet it has endless flexibility : a man travels through time and space , fighting for good against evil wherever he goes			1
it 's accessible , uplifting and endlessly entertaining because it engages the viewer 's imagination and credits them with intelligence			2
it can regenerate itself ( even its leading man ) to keep the show modern and in tune with its audience			2
@entity0 : what sets the fandom for " @entity5 " apart from others ? @entity37 : " @entity5 " fans are the best in the world			1
they 've stayed with the show through thick and thin			2
they are devoted , smart and not afraid to let us know how they feel ! they feel a part of the show , particularly as they kept it alive through all the years it was off air			0
we 're very lucky to have them behind the show			0
@entity0 : how has the fandom evolved over the years ? @entity37 : it 's a generational thing			1
parents who watched the show as kids are now sharing it with their kids			0
the audience is constantly renewing			0
the late teenage / early 20s audience seems to be growing as the classic show is being rediscovered on @entity93 and box sets , and the brand spreads from the @entity96 across the world			0
@entity0 : how important do you think the " new " series has been in attracting fans ? @entity37 : new material always rewards devotion , but we 've tried to develop the show and aspire to new ways of telling stories to keep the show evolving			1
the show changes to keep pace with the modern world			0
it 's very accessible , deliberately so , so hopefully the great stories , higher production values and superb cast have attracted people who had maybe dismissed the classic series			2
@entity0 : what are your fondest memories of " @entity5 " ? @entity37 : as a fan , sitting down on a wintry saturday night with crumpets to watch @entity124 's doctor			1
as a producer , standing in @entity127 shooting , surrounded by a horde of fans			0
it was quite exciting and humbling at the same time			0
@entity0 : is there anything in particular that you can promise fans when they see the 50th episode ? any teases of what can they expect ? @entity37 : it 's both a celebration of the past 50 years of " @entity5 , " and the foundations of the future of the show			1
the next chapter starts here			0
it 's both a reward for the long - term fan -- questions will be answered ! -- and the perfect place for a new viewer to jump on			0
a tease ? a picture is worth a thousand words			0
... @entity0 : what do you think is the show 's greatest contribution to science fiction ? to television ? @entity37 : i think we 've proved you ca n't keep a good show down !			1
