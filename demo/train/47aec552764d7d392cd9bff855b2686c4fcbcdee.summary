editor 's note : the staff at @entity3 has been intrigued by the journalism of @entity5 , an independent media company and web site based in @entity7 , @entity8			2
the reports , which are produced solely by vice , reflect a very transparent approach to journalism , where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process			2
we believe this unique reporting approach is worthy of sharing with our @entity3 readers			0
@entity7 , @entity8 ( @entity5 ) -- in the middle of @entity21 's @entity20 , east of @entity22 and down an unmarked dirt road stretching across the @entity25 district of @entity27 territory , there is a place where many have found salvation			1
it is known as @entity31 , the home of the @entity33 , which has attracted at least 5,000 followers since its establishment in 1990			2
last summer , after years of unanswered emails to the church 's press department , i was finally invited to visit			1
the church 's leader is known as @entity33 , a.k.a. the teacher			2
in another life he was @entity33 and served as a patrol officer in @entity45 until the late 1980s			1
then , on august 18 , 1990 , he experienced a revelation : his was the word of @entity48			0
he began sermonizing in and around his hometown and soon , with a handful of newly converted followers by his side , he retreated to the ancient @entity20 and began a new life -- and , some might say , founded an entirely new world			0
just about everything @entity33 has ever said or thought has been recorded in the never - ending @entity59 , a follow - up of sorts to the @entity61 that currently spans 10 volumes and thousands of pages			1
inside is doctrine on the dual origins of the universe ( one spawned nature , the other the human soul ) , something called the " outer - space mind " ( aliens , basically ) , and the rapidly approaching end of the world			0
or at least this is what i understand from the handful of scriptures that have been ( somewhat poorly ) translated into @entity79			0
while @entity83 imagery abounds , the church 's ideology is an all - encompassing amalgam of the world 's major religions and includes aspects of @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity90 and many other spiritual philosophies			1
see the rest of @entity93 at @entity5 i first learned of @entity33 and his church from " @entity96 , " @entity98 's 1993 documentary about @entity100 mysticism that explored the country 's renewed interest in religion following the fall of the @entity105 and its official stance of @entity107 ( state atheism )			1
back then , @entity109 was nothing more than a handful of simple structures on unfertile land in the middle of the forest			0
today , i would discover , it is an almost completely self - sufficient community with solar power , satellite television , bountiful organic gardens and an overwhelming air of contentment			1
once open to journalists , a few years back @entity33 claimed that he would never give an interview again			0
but somehow , some way , he granted me an audience and i was allowed to ask a man who many believe to be the reincarnation of @entity128 if he had any answers for our troubled world			1
i 'm still not sure if his advice is applicable outside of his insular kingdom , but since my trip i have often thought of his blessed community and how everyone there seemed to be full of joy			0
it 's enough to make you consider that they just may be onto something .			0

@entity100 patrol officer turned self - *proclaimed* @entity128 has following of thousands
followers live in a self - sufficient community in a remote region of @entity21
after years of asking , vice 's *request* to visit was finally granted last summer
