it 's about making an entrance			1
dramatic entries are a given with air travel , and airports should convey a sense of welcome and arrival to travelers landing in a new city , like the great train stations of yesteryear , says architecture critic @entity12			1
that does n't usually happen			0
" an inspiring grand welcome to a place is not something you get in most of them , " says @entity12 , contributor to @entity15 , winner of the @entity17 for his architecture criticism at the @entity19 and author of " @entity21			0
" " most only aspire to a sense of efficiency and most do n't even achieve that			0
" where they exist at airports , the more impressive spaces are usually located in the airports ' departure halls			1
those passengers are rushing to clear security and catch flights and do n't have time to appreciate their space			0
the arrivals hall usually does n't inspire much			0
check in : @entity43 's best airport hotels " when you arrive , you 're shunted to a lower level to baggage claim and go through what feels like a service ( exit ) , " says @entity12 , who regularly flies through @entity44 and @entity46 's bustling but not very beautiful airports			1
although most airports do n't meet his wish for a " grand welcome " -- even the ones he likes -- some architects are designing lovely airports that are worth admiring			1
here are some of the airport designs @entity12 has appreciated or is hankering to see for himself			2
@entity62 ( @entity63 ) the design by architect @entity65 for @entity62 ' @entity66 , completed in 2006 , is one of @entity12 's favorites			2
" he took what is really a conventional plan , and he did a traditional airport beautifully , " he says			2
@entity65 ' elegant architecture includes " magnificent steel tresses and columns , and a very long concourse that gradually changes colors , " says @entity12			0
" the colors fade over the course of what must be half a mile			0
" @entity83 ( @entity84 ) sir @entity85 has been " more successful than anyone else at rethinking the airport and designing it in a new way that pretty much works , " says @entity12			2
@entity85 's international terminal design in @entity83 was completed in 2008 in time for that summer 's @entity91			1
instead of a stretched - out layout or satellite terminals , @entity98 " is essentially two huge triangular shapes , where the points face each other and are connected by a train , " he says			0
" that works quite well and is attractive			0
" 5 great get - fit retreats @entity101 ( @entity102 , @entity103 ) architect @entity105 's most remarkable achievement in this case may have been winning a design competition in 1988 for an airport that would sit on a man - made island that did not yet exist			1
located 25 miles away from @entity102 , @entity103 ( and three miles off the coast ) , @entity101 airport was completed in 1994 and can handle air traffic 24 hours per day			2
the island is now connected to the mainland by a 2.5 mile - long , two - level bridge			0
the airport is lovely , but " it 's more the achievement than the architecture itself , " says @entity12			1
@entity120 ( @entity121 , @entity122 ) completed in 1981 , @entity123 , @entity124 and @entity126 's design of the @entity120 in @entity121 seems to capture the essence of @entity122 's nomadic tradition			1
the firm developed tent - like structures using little energy to keep the space cool in the desert			2
pictures of the terminal impressed @entity12 , which is why it 's on his bucket list as an airport to visit			1
" @entity121 seems like a fascinating attempt to marry the nomadic tradition of desert tents with monumental modern architecture , " says @entity12			1
" a seeming impossibility , but i think they pulled it off			0
" @entity43 's best airport spas @entity147 ( @entity148 ) often overlooked as an example of good airport architecture , @entity147 's @entity149 was designed by @entity152 of @entity153 and completed in 2011			1
inspired by its @entity155 roots and its service to the @entity167 hub of companies and universities , " it 's a terminal that has a lot of wood and glass inside , a nice alternative to steel and glass , " says @entity12			1
@entity170 ( @entity171 , @entity172 ) seeking to modernize and expand the airport serving @entity172 's capital , airport operators turned to native son and world renowned architect @entity175			1
completed in 2009 , the @entity170 's structure seems inspired by the rolling dunes along the country 's coastline			1
the design is intriguing to @entity12 , which is why the @entity170 airport is also on his list of airports to experience			1
" i 've wanted to see @entity172 because @entity175 's swooping shape looks wonderful in photographs , " says @entity12			1
" it looks like something inspired by @entity192 's design " for @entity193 at @entity194 ( then called @entity194 )			2
airlines collect $ 27 billion beyond ticket revenue @entity197 ( @entity194 , @entity44 ) it 's not in use anymore , but @entity12 says it still stands out as an architectural marvel			2
( maybe if it was still open , @entity12 would like flying out of @entity194 better			0
) designed by @entity192 and opened in 1962 , this gorgeous terminal had a significant flaw : it was n't built to change and grow with the growth of travel and the enormous aircraft that would soon come to @entity194 , now @entity194			2
" it was one of the great airport designs of all time , and it was completely unworkable for security and the volume of traffic ( to come ) , " says @entity12			0
" it remains a beautiful and incredibly inspiring building			0
" @entity219 mural ( @entity194 , @entity44 ) no , this does n't mean @entity12 likes flying out of the @entity222 terminal where this mural is located			0
@entity224 architect and artist @entity219 was commissioned to paint a mural of the great architecture of the world on a wall at the @entity231 terminal			0
so while @entity12 is n't crazy about the airport , the mural " is one of my favorite things at any airport			0
" a pleasant experience matters , too when @entity12 is trying to get from one city to another , sometimes his requirements for a nice airport are the same as anyone else			0
at the last minute , that 's why he also tacked on these " fairly ordinary terminals that are nevertheless pleasanter to be in than the norm " : @entity247 's newly redone @entity149 and the @entity249 terminal at @entity194 in @entity44			1
" lots of light , nice places to eat , wide - open spaces , views of ( the ) field , places to work , rest , etc. , " he wrote , via e-mail			0
" great architecture is n't always necessary to raise an airport above mediocrity			0
