@entity0 -- aviation fans have already named it dreamliner 2.0			1
no longer grounded for safety concerns , @entity5 's embattled @entity4 now has a few things to prove			1
monday might be a good day to start			0
that 's when domestic dreamliner flights return to @entity11 's airways			1
at 11 a.m. , @entity13 flight 1 is scheduled to depart @entity0 's @entity14 for @entity16 's @entity15			1
the airline plans to roll out additional 787 flights throughout the week			1
some international carriers have already resumed dreamliner service			2
for aviation enthusiasts it 's kind of a big deal			1
as word spreads of @entity4 's return , travel advisers report they 're getting calls from curious fliers looking to connect with one of @entity13 's six 787s at @entity4 hubs			1
they want a chance to ride the 787 and experience its fancy interior lighting , high - tech windows and mysterious anti-turbulence technology			1
so far , @entity13 is the only @entity11 carrier flying the aircraft dreamliner interactive : the @entity4 layout this plane is so lightweight that it can fly farther with the same amount of fuel as heavier airliners			1
it can carry 200 - plus passengers a third of the way around the globe			1
@entity5 says the plane 's increased profitability will open more destination cities for travelers			1
industry observers are curious to see what the future holds for @entity4 , the first entire airline model to be grounded by the @entity56 in more than 30 years			1
lithium - ion batteries that overheated on two @entity58 in january prompted authorities to ground all 50 787s worldwide , but a redesigned battery system has cleared the way for the plane 's return			1
behind the scenes : @entity5 's dreamliner battery fix here are five things about @entity4 for @entity11 travelers to keep in mind now that it 's back in service : how safe is it ? " it 's a safe airliner to get back on and fly , " says capt. @entity73 , president of the @entity74 , an independent aviation safety think tank			1
the @entity56 simply exercised an abundance of caution when it grounded the aircraft , he says			1
what travelers should take away from the grounding is " the fact that we 've got a pretty good system that works			0
" still , now that all eyes are on @entity4 in the wake of the grounding , new reports of even minor glitches are likely to make travelers nervous			0
@entity92 airline ana reported an incident that damaged an electrical distribution panel on a @entity4 test flight on may 4			2
@entity91 blamed it on a nut that had not been properly tightened , calling it a " minor issue " unrelated to batteries			0
a team made up of experts from @entity5 and from outside the company redesigned the battery system , which separates , insulates and ventilates the battery cells			1
passenger rights advocates have screamed " conflict of interest " about the @entity56 's longstanding policy allowing @entity5 to certify components of its own aircraft			1
they 're calling for more independent testing and analysis of @entity4 's battery fix			1
but @entity73 says the process is safe and as independent as possible			2
" looking at historical data , we have n't had any evidence over the years that self - certification has been responsible for any problems , " says @entity115 , a former member of the @entity116 , the federal air crash investigation agency			1
travelers have such high regard for the safety of the @entity11 aviation system they do n't pay much attention to the kind of plane they 're flying , says @entity131 , travel adviser and self - described " president and chief airline dork " of @entity135			1
most are n't worried about flying the 787 , but if @entity4 develops another problem " then that might change things			2
" @entity115 , who also worked for years as an airline mechanic , warns that a repeat incident with the batteries " would severely impeach @entity5 's engineering capabilities			1
" success for the @entity4 heavily relies on no repeats , @entity115 says			0
how 's its reputation ? when an aircraft is hit by the first @entity56 grounding order for an entire airliner type in three decades , does it come with a stigma ? " they 're definitely going to have some lumps in the road because of that , " says @entity115			1
on the other hand , @entity131 believes the " average everyday traveler is n't looking at the specific aircraft type			0
they 're looking at the flight times and they 're looking at the prices			2
" " i 'm sure there are some people that are feeling like they do n't want to get on it , " says @entity131			0
" they 'll probably feel that way in the short term until the @entity4 develops a " track record of being reliable and safe			2
" @entity1 readers have mixed feelings about the new plane			2
" if there are no further incidents absolutely no one is going to remember this in a year or two , " wrote one commenter			0
" other troubled airplanes like the @entity180 actually killed people and still went on to be successes			0
" another is n't so optimistic : " i fly between continents 1 - 2 times per year and have done so for the last decade and i will never set foot on a @entity4			2
" how does it feel ? we 'll soon find out for ourselves when we fly @entity190 1 today , but supposedly , @entity4 air is rare up there			0
new cabin environmental systems allow control of air pressure and humidity			0
@entity4 's cabin pressure is set to the equivalent of 6,000 feet above sea level -- compared to the traditional setting of 8,000 feet			2
feeling like you 're at a lower altitude lets the body absorb more oxygen , making passengers less susceptible to airsickness			2
humidity in the cabin is supposed to feel more comfortable , too			0
everybody talks about the windows			0
by pushing a button under each one , it activates energized gel embedded in the windowpane , which darkens or lightens the glass			0
check back here with @entity1 today and we 'll let you know what these tech - laden features are really like			2
how does it ride ? it 's a mystery how it works , but the @entity4 comes equipped with gust suppression technology that is designed to smooth the ride during moderate turbulence			2
@entity5 is keeping its cards close to the vest			0
suffice it to say sensors on the aircraft respond to turbulence and send command signals that adjust parts of the wings			0
result : smoother flying , says @entity5			0
we 'll check it out for ourselves			0
" it looks pretty awesome , although i 'd just rather not have turbulence -- then you do n't need the gust suppression , " jokes @entity131			0
" but i think it will be interesting to see how that feels , and how the plane handles it			2
" how did we get here ? @entity5 used to think airlines felt a need for speed			0
but the company soon learned it had miscalculated			0
what the airlines really wanted was efficiency , triggering a trend toward fuel - sipping , lightweight , long - range airliners			1
here 's what happened : in the early 2000s , @entity5 was brainstorming the next generation of airliners -- the first that would be built largely from lightweight carbon - composite materials			1
these new planes would jet across the nation at about 650 mph -- nearly the speed of sound			0
they called this idea the @entity258			0
but as oil prices rose , the @entity258 took a dive			0
@entity5 abandoned the concept , keeping the idea of a new lightweight , carbon - composite airliner			2
@entity264 was out , efficiency in			0
by 2003 , the project had a name : dreamliner			0
this year , @entity5 's rival @entity268 will follow @entity4 with its @entity269 , another sleek , long - distance fuel - sipper that can carry 200 - plus passengers			1
related story : @entity268 rolls out sleek , new @entity269 @entity1 's @entity274 boards @entity5 's dreamliner later today for its first domestic flight on a @entity11 carrier after it was grounded earlier this year			1
check back for updates later today and follow his progress on @entity280 .			0

@entity282 is the first @entity11 *commercial* dreamliner flight in more than four months
battery troubles led the @entity56 to ground the 787 , the first model fleet grounded in 30 years
experts say plane is safe ; travel advisers say enthusiasts are *requesting* bookings
it 's the first of a new generation of efficient airliners that can carry 200 - plus passengers
