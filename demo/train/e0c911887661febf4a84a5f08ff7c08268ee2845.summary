-- " can we trust that politician ? " typically , that 's the question we ask when assessing a political candidate			1
but with @entity6 , i think the question should go the other way around : does he trust us ? and there 's a lot of evidence that he does not			1
why else would @entity6 be so guarded ? so afraid to open up to us about who he really is ? @entity6 does n't want to talk about the details of his work at @entity18 -- the private equity firm he ran for 15 years			1
he 's reticent to talk about his faith			2
he wo n't offer us details about various policy positions despite fellow @entity24 urging him to do so			0
and the biggest sign of his lack of trust is his refusal to release more than two years of his income tax returns			1
maybe it 's not us			0
perhaps @entity6 just has " trust issues			1
" i 'm not a psychologist , and my sister , who is one , has made it clear i know nothing about this field			0
( we can just chalk that up to sibling rivalry			0
) but you do n't have to be @entity42 ( or my sister ) to sense intuitively that @entity6 is an extremely private , risk - adverse individual			2
he is so standoffish , he makes @entity44 look like @entity45			0
his reserve might be fine in the corporate boardroom where you 're judged primarily on the company 's bottom line			0
but when you are running for president , likability is important -- even more than policy positions for some voters			0
and on a purely human level , it 's hard to like a person if you do n't feel like you know him or her because that person is intentionally keeping something from you			0
in the absence of information , it 's natural to sense there is a less than positive reason for the evasive behavior			2
opinion : why @entity6 is losing the consequences of @entity6 's holding back can be seen in two polls released this week			1
the first , released wednesday by @entity74 / @entity73 , found that only 40 % of @entity75 view him favorably -- in contrast with president @entity77 who maintains a 53 % favorability rating			2
and worse , @entity6 is viewed unfavorably by 49 % of @entity75 -- an increase of a whopping 18 percentage points since the beginning of this year			1
and a @entity0 / @entity83 poll released thursday finds @entity77 has opened up a seven - point lead over @entity6			2
if @entity6 wants to win this election , he needs to trust us -- to stop keeping things from us and tell us who he is as a person , not a politician			1
and he had a great chance to do just this at the @entity93 in july when he told the audience : " i believe that if you understood who i truly am in my heart ... you would vote for me for president			0
" this was @entity6 's moment to tell us what is in his heart			1
instead , he proceeded to recite his generic stump speech			0
like @entity104 waking up on christmas morning realizing he still has chance to right his life , so does @entity6			2
he should immediately release his past tax returns for at least three or four years			1
polls show that a majority of @entity75 want him to do just that --- just like so many other presidential candidates have in the past , including his father who ran for the 1968 @entity24 presidential nomination and released a dozen years of tax returns			1
the likely reason @entity6 wo n't release the past returns is fear			1
and that 's not based on something i learned in @entity121			0
it 's what @entity123 -- his wife -- stated during an interview with @entity74 in july			0
there , she said that if they released additional tax returns , the information contained in them would be used to attack @entity6			1
she is 100 % correct on that one			0
both sides in this race will use anything and everything against each other			0
@entity6 saw this happen firsthand during the @entity24 presidential primaries when he released a tax return			1
his fellow @entity24 immediately pounced on the low rate of taxes he paid			0
but here is where trust comes in			0
@entity6 has to trust that we know the difference between political bs and real issues			2
while the @entity77 campaign will attack @entity6 's return , it does not mean most @entity75 will be swayed by it			1
@entity6 needs to understand this about the average @entity75 : we are more concerned with what taxes we are paying , not what the @entity156 paid			1
@entity6 may find want to heed the advice of the @entity160 philosopher , @entity159 , who stated : " he who does not trust enough , will not be trusted			2
" @entity6 needs to show some faith in us			2
let us in to see who he really is -- flaws and all			0
opening up could just be the thing that propels him to victory in november			0
or @entity6 can simply remain guarded and closed off -- leaving us with the question : if @entity6 does n't trust us , why should we trust him ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity170 .			1

@entity170 : many of @entity6 's troubles are a result of holding back information
he says candidate should release more tax returns , open up about @entity18 , detail policy plans
@entity170 : if a candidate wants @entity75 to trust him , he must trust them
