@entity0 -- the president 's top counterterrorism adviser says there is indisputable evidence that dozens of terrorist groups have sought weapons of mass destruction			0
but a @entity10 intelligence official who is not authorized to speak for attribution said although @entity12 clearly wants a nuclear weapons capability , it has n't gotten very far			1
" at this point , they do n't appear to have made much progress , but we continue to review every bit of information that comes in to determine whether they 've advanced their efforts in any way whatsoever , " said the official			2
" developing a nuclear device involves a highly sophisticated technical process , and @entity12 does n't seem to have mastered it based on what we know now			1
" the concern that terrorists will get hold of nuclear material and use it in an attack is a far greater threat than the older concern of global nuclear war , according to the president 's @entity37			1
at a briefing kicking off president @entity42 's nuclear security summit on monday , presidential adviser @entity39 said @entity12 in particular has been actively trying to acquire a nuclear weapon for the past 15 years			1
" @entity12 is especially notable for its longstanding interest in weapons [ of ] useable nuclear material and the requisite expertise that would allow it to develop a yield - producing improvised nuclear device , " said @entity39			1
with a nuclear capability , @entity12 would be able to achieve what @entity39 called its sole objective			1
" they would have the ability not only to threaten our security and world order in an unprecedented manner , but also to kill and injure many thousands of innocent men , women and children , " he said			0
officials are concerned not only about the possibility that terrorists could get full - fledged nuclear weapons , but also about the threat that radioactive material could be spread by simpler devices			1
@entity1 national security analyst @entity69 wrote in 2008 that " there is plenty of evidence that [ @entity12 ] has experimented with crude chemical and biological weapons , and also attempted to acquire radioactive materials suitable for a ' dirty ' bomb , a device that marries conventional explosives to radioactive materials			1
" organized crime and criminal gangs are well aware of the terrorist group 's interest in acquiring bomb - making materials , which has led criminals to pursue getting those items for their own profit , according to @entity39			1
when pressed by reporters about whether there was specific intelligence indicating an active threat now , @entity39 would only say , " i think you can point to a lot of @entity12 activities and public statements that underscore their determination to carry out attacks against the @entity10 and @entity100 interests			1
" nuclear weapons expert @entity101 said it is unclear what terrorists are up to and when they might act			2
" all the evidence supports that @entity12 is looking to try to gather the capabilities to make a nuclear weapon			1
it 's not easy to do			0
but they 're learning , " he told @entity1 on tuesday			0
" they 're doing the things that one would need to do to get nuclear weapons -- get help from those who know , start looking around for loose nukes ... look into black markets , can you buy it ? that 's why this summit is so important			2
we do need to secure the nuclear explosive materials much better			2
and it has to be done internationally			0
" a new report released on monday indicates there have been 18 documented cases of theft or loss of the two key ingredients of a nuclear weapon			1
" securing the bomb 2010 , " a report from the @entity134 , cites two incidents in particular			2
in november 2007 , a group of armed men attacked a nuclear facility in @entity140 that contained hundreds of kilograms of highly enriched uranium			0
the men were stopped , but they escaped capture			0
and in february 2006 , a @entity145 man was arrested in the country of @entity147 with nearly 80 grams of highly enriched uranium			0
there was some evidence suggesting the uranium came from a @entity145 nuclear fuel plant			0
the author of a book called " @entity154 , " @entity151 also worries about whether @entity156 's nuclear stockpile is secure , despite assurances from both the @entity10 and @entity156 that it is			0
@entity156 " has had many leaks from its program of classified information and sensitive nuclear equipment , and so you have to worry that it could be acquired in @entity156 , " @entity151 said			0
however the @entity10 intelligence official said there is no indication that terrorists have gotten anything from @entity156 , and added there is confidence right now in @entity156 's security apparatus			2
the @entity156 store their nuclear stockpile in a way that makes it difficult to put the pieces together ; that is , components are located in different places			0
the official said @entity156 has put the appropriate safeguards in place .			0
