-- @entity1 was whacking golf balls across a bridge in @entity4 last week , but back in @entity6 , @entity5 is still feeling the need to build them following the " fried chicken " saga earlier this year			1
speaking to @entity0 's @entity11 , @entity5 once again struck a chord of contrition over the comments he made about the @entity15 last may			1
" i did n't mean it in a bad way			0
when i was driving back to the hotel , i started thinking about it , " @entity5 told @entity18			1
" obviously , i did n't expect that question at all and you try to be funny and it comes out the wrong way i guess , " he added			0
@entity5 made the comment during a private dinner at @entity27 a couple of weeks after he and @entity1 had endured a fractious third round at the @entity29 -- the @entity30 complained that the gallery following @entity32 had disturbed him during a shot			1
when asked in jest if he would be inviting @entity1 for dinner during the then upcoming @entity36 , @entity5 replied : " yeah , we will have him around every night			1
we will serve fried chicken			1
" fried chicken is a common food in the @entity42 , but when used in reference to african - americans can often imply a negative stereotype			2
fellow @entity47 star @entity46 perhaps summed up the slip best on @entity49 : " private / humor filled environment but he ( @entity5 ) should n't have said it # slip			2
" the remark echoed @entity57 golfer @entity56 's infamous slur on @entity1 ' following his maiden major win at the masters in 1997			2
" tell him not to serve fried chicken next year , " @entity56 said to reporters in an attempt to make humor of the fact that @entity1 was the first @entity64 to win the tournament			1
tradition dictates that the reigning @entity69 champion choose the menu for the @entity71 the following year			0
@entity1 tweeted that @entity5 's comments were " wrong , hurtful and clearly inappropriate " and even the @entity30 's equipment makers @entity73 weighed in calling the comments " offensive			1
" @entity5 issued an unreserved apology via the @entity77 but recoils when asked to recall the media storm that followed the jibe			2
" it was horrible , but what 's done is done			0
everybody knows how i feel about it , so i think they should be fine with it and if not , it 's kind of their problem , " he said			0
" the most important thing is learning from all those things			0
" i 'm making sure that all those experiences make you stronger , a better person and things like that			0
i think that i 've learned from those things and i just need to keep getting better at it , and hopefully keep making people happy			0
