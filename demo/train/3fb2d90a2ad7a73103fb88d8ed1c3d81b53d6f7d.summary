-- the @entity2 coast can be a moody destination year - round			1
in the mornings , brooding fog canopies the coastal highways and storms can roll in from the @entity8 , kicking up without much warning			1
but in mid- to late summer , the heavier rains seem to sidestep the coast and , more often than not , sunshine blinks from behind the clouds			2
whale spouts are spotted from shore ; seals stretch and bark on the rocks ; and tourists in search of stunning @entity23 views are drawn to the iconic highway 101 en masse			2
it 's a small dot on the map between @entity27 and @entity28 , but slipping by @entity29 , @entity2 , and all this historical city offers , would be a shame			1
born near the mouth of the @entity33 in the late 1800s , @entity29 was a rugged coastal frontier settlement that relied mostly on fishing and logging to power its economy			1
today , the city still counts these industries as important , but these days tourism is bringing in the bling			0
and it 's easy to understand the draw			0
@entity29 has a charming old - world downtown , the @entity33 curves along its edges , offering spectacular natural views , and it is located along what is arguably the most beautiful and diverse section of the @entity49			1
20 stunning cliffside beaches if you 're traveling north on @entity52 , you 'll cross one of this community 's most notable landmarks , the @entity56 , a stunning double leaf bascule ( or moveable ) bridge featuring four towering art - deco - style obelisks			1
a quick right turn at the end of the bridge will spool you down into @entity29 's @entity63 , a small but charming collection of restaurants , curio shops , coffee shops , art galleries and @entity69			1
walk along @entity71 , a wide avenue with intermittent views of the @entity33 and well - maintained flower gardens			1
here you 'll see a collection of historical buildings , many of them salvaged from nearby communities and given a second life in @entity29			1
for instance , the @entity81 is housed in an old train depot found abandoned in @entity84 , @entity2 , and saved from demolition more than 40 years ago			1
today , this restaurant is one of the best places to watch the river crawl by while swilling a @entity89 -- a sublime mixture of rum , mango juice , lemon juice , simple syrup and soda			0
another must - have on the menu is the dreamy crab - encrusted @entity98 draped with a chili cream sauce			1
after dinner , make sure to find @entity102 , a small , nearly hidden patch tucked away off @entity71			1
this intimate enclave featuring a small dock , a bench , and , you guessed it , a gazebo is about as romantic a getaway as you 'll find in these parts			2
linger on a park bench until sundown and watch the stars reflect off the river			0
another historical building that found new life in @entity29 is the @entity118 , a two - story 1914 craftsman - style charmer with six bedrooms and a private apartment			1
most rooms have views of either the river or the famous @entity2 sand dunes			1
nightly rates start at $ 165 during prime season ( may through mid-october )			0
50 states , 50 spots : natural wonders one of the best times to explore @entity29 is in may , when the city celebrates its annual @entity133 , a tradition for more than a century			1
after perusing the antique shops , browsing the art galleries or visiting the @entity137 , grab a strong cup of coffee at the @entity140 , a locally owned gem that roasts its own beans			0
the eclectic shop is housed in a converted garage and outboard motor repair shop and is where you 're sure to see loads of locals crowded around tables or sitting along a beautifully recovered church pew			0
this is the place to be when the weather turns gloomy and the gas stove is roaring in one corner			0
rain never sounds as good as when it 's thumping heavy on the coffee shop 's tin roof , and when the storm passes , check out the view of the river and bridge from the back deck			0
if you 're in the mood for adventure and do n't mind getting a little sand in your teeth , head south out of @entity29 for an off - highway vehicle tour of the famous @entity171			1
a 40 - mile expanse of arid , wind - sculpted sand dunes extends from @entity29 to @entity27 , @entity2 , and is a complete change from the green , lush @entity2 environment most people know			1
here , toast - colored sand dunes tower some 500 feet above sea level , and , in select areas , off - highway vehicle rentals zoom around and over the dunes at dizzying speeds			2
join one of the many off - highway vehicle tour groups in the area , but use caution : some group tours can be pretty adrenalin - fueled			2
it 's rumored that the eerie , windswept landscape is what inspired sci - fi author @entity191 to pen his best - selling novel , " @entity194			2
" for a closer look at some of @entity2 's favorite residents , tour the @entity199 , a privately owned nature preserve just a few miles north of @entity29 up @entity52			1
visitors may take an elevator down 208 feet into what 's touted as the largest sea cave in @entity204 , roughly the length of a football field and 125 feet high			0
@entity208 's top 25 theme parks from an observation ledge , watch the natural comings and goings of the @entity213 sea lions who call this enclave home			0
the sea lions are most likely to congregate in the grotto during the fall and winter , whereas they take full advantage of the sunnier spring and summer weather to frolic on the rock formations just outside the caves			0
@entity223 whales are sometimes spotted swimming in the area , especially in the spring and summer			0
be aware that the sea lion trademark " barking " can be loud and , while they are cute , their collective odor is less than adorable			0
adult tickets are $ 14 ; children 5 and older may enter for $ 8 ; children under 5 are free			0
do n't miss the newly renovated and working @entity232 , which towers 205 feet above the @entity8 and has a light beam visible 21 miles out to sea			1
the crisp - looking white lighthouse with red roof stands out in sharp contrast to the stunning ocean vistas all around it			2
book a room at the lightkeeper 's cottage , a working @entity243 just a few hundred feet away from the lighthouse itself			0
the delightful @entity247 - style home features an expansive view of the @entity8 , an acre of well - maintained grounds , six distinctive rooms and a hearty breakfast selection			2
rooms begin at $ 209 during the coveted high season ( may through october )			0
in the evening , as the light begins to soften , make like a local and gather a bucket , headlamp and some waders and search the soft sands of the riverbeds for mussels and clams			0
regulars have a few favorite spots including a small inlet up @entity266 near the fork of the @entity33			2
even if you 're not in the mood to get muddy , grab a blanket and a hot beverage and relax along the shore as you watch the bobbing lights of the clam diggers blend in with the stars			0
your vacation has officially begun .			0
