the suspected @entity4 terrorists who had a shootout with police on thursday in @entity7 , @entity1 , have ties to @entity10 - linked cells in other @entity12 countries , a senior @entity1 counterterrorism source told @entity2 on friday			1
the two suspects who died in the shootout are believed to have fought with @entity10 in @entity15 , the source said			1
another man was captured but has n't revealed any information			2
there also was a dire warning : not all the terrorists in the cell have been rounded up , according to the source			2
@entity1 police have taken out part of the terror network plotting an attack in @entity1 , but they have not yet taken down every component of it , the source said			1
there is fear others may try to avenge the two men			0
authorities investigating the aftermath of the raid in which the men were killed found materials used to make bombs , including chemicals for the powerful explosive @entity41 , but the suspected terrorists had yet to assemble those weapons			1
cell members had discussed attacking police in wiretapped phone conversations , but @entity1 investigators still did not know what they were intending to target for sure , the source said			1
the discovery of police uniforms after the raid suggested the possibility they may have been trying to gain access to sensitive sites			2
the source characterized the cell as one with organized structures , a logistical support network and links back to @entity15 and @entity65			0
@entity1 is one of the nations participating in airstrikes in @entity65 , and officials are concerned this plot is @entity10 " pivoting " to launch attacks on the @entity12 countries involved in the military action against their troops in @entity65			1
" i think one of the things that 's happening is we 're seeing something that 's surprising me			0
that is the pivot of @entity10 , " @entity83			1
a former @entity85 counterterrorism official and a @entity2 analyst , said			1
" just last summer , we were talking about how quickly @entity10 was taking over geography			1
for a terrorist group to turn around in six or eight months and start training people for operations in @entity91 is remarkable			0
" in the raid in @entity7 , a city of about 56,000 people , police approached three suspects as they carried large duffel bags outside of a former bakery that might have been their lair , a @entity93 intelligence source told @entity2			1
the suspects immediately opened fire with multiple weapons , prosecutors ' spokesman @entity103 said			0
police returned fire ; two gunmen were killed and another was arrested , federal prosecutor @entity108 said			2
that raid turned up four kalashnikovs , handguns , bomb - making materials and police uniforms , van der @entity108 said			2
@entity117 refused to name the two killed in @entity7 , but said " we have a pretty good idea " who they were			2
answering reporters ' questions , the prosecutor would not comment on reported plans by the suspects to abduct or behead any victims			0
the @entity1 counterterrorism source said @entity1 authorities had asked the @entity85 for help in finding the director of the plot , a @entity1 who was in @entity134			1
neither the @entity85 nor @entity134 officials were able to locate the man			2
he is described as a key link to @entity10 in @entity15 for the terror cell and once fought there			1
the two men killed in the shootout were among more than a dozen people rounded up in across - the - country raids designed to stop a group 's allegedly imminent attack -- a plot to kill @entity1 police in streets and stations -- van der @entity152 said earlier friday			1
the alleged plotters -- including the two people killed thursday night in a battle with police in @entity7 -- were confronted in 12 raids across @entity1 from thursday into friday , @entity108 said			1
" could have been hours , certainly no more than a day or two " before terror attacks were to begin throughout @entity1 , van der @entity108 told reporters of the alleged plot			1
besides the two killed , 17 have been arrested in the investigation -- 13 in the @entity1 raids and four others in @entity165 , including two who were detained while trying to cross from @entity165 into @entity167 , van der @entity108 's office said			1
investigators have n't found any links between the alleged @entity1 plot and last week 's @entity4 terror attacks that killed 17 people in @entity176 , the prosecutor said			1
but the @entity1 raids come amid fears of ongoing terror threats in @entity91 -- as many as 20 terror cells with 120 to 180 people may be ready to strike in @entity165 , @entity183 , @entity1 and the @entity184 , a @entity93 intelligence source told @entity2			1
thursday night 's raids were a dramatic culmination in a chain of @entity1 police investigations into an alleged terror cell that included people who had fought in @entity15 , van der @entity108 said			1
the @entity193 intelligence community knew for weeks of the plot in @entity1 and was sharing critical information with @entity1 authorities , several @entity193 officials told @entity2			1
the officials would n't say precisely what they knew , how much they knew , and when they knew it			1
there is concern those details could signal other militants planning other potential attacks			2
one @entity193 official told @entity2 's @entity207 the entire " developing plot was being monitored and watched			1
" the official said , " we were aware			2
we were tracking this , " and added , " ' there is a high probability other attacks were being planned " before the plots were disrupted by the raids			1

the @entity193 was aware of the timing of the @entity1 moves , @entity193 officials said			1
@entity7 is a little off the beaten path in eastern @entity1 , the last stop before open fields and forest			1
like many @entity12 towns , it 's densely built			0
the whole city must have heard the explosions and the gunfight , according to resident @entity229			0
" i can hear it			0
everybody can hear it , " he said			0
" in this little city , everybody heard the sound			0
" from his window , he could see police firing assault rifles at a nearby house			0
@entity229 recorded the assault on the house and posted it on @entity243			0
the two who were killed were of @entity247 descent , the @entity93 intelligence source said			2
@entity7 is home to many people with @entity251 roots , according to a study by the nearby @entity253			0

@entity7 is about 69 miles ( 111 kilometers ) east - southeast of @entity259 and 200 miles ( 322 kilometers ) northeast of @entity176			0
the raids came as authorities monitored people returning from @entity15 , said @entity103 , the prosecutors ' spokesman			0
police had arrested , questioned and searched @entity266 , a @entity1 suspected arms dealer allegedly aligned with @entity10 and suspected of providing weapons to @entity268 , the man who attacked a @entity176 kosher supermarket			1
@entity266 knew @entity268 's wife , @entity270 , who is also a terror suspect in @entity165			0
@entity266 's lawyer @entity271 said his client was facing local firearms charges and had no connection with any jihadi groups or terror plans			0
in the process , police turned up names that solidified their suspicions about known persons , the @entity93 intelligence source said			0
last weekend , they arrested two more men at the @entity286 airport -- as they returned from @entity15 -- squeezed them for information then decided to act quickly , the source said			0
" the investigation made it possible to determine that the group was about to carry out major terrorist attacks in @entity1 imminently , " @entity1 prosecutor spokesman @entity103 said			1

in neighboring @entity183 , police in at least two cities arrested men they accuse of supporting jihadis in @entity15			0
these suspects did not appear to be planning homegrown attacks , @entity183 authorities said			0
the fear of terror was already high in @entity91 after the bloodbaths in @entity165 that followed multiple threats of attacks from @entity10 -- the @entity4 group fighting to establish what it calls its @entity348 caliphate in @entity65 and @entity15 -- and @entity349			1
@entity349 has claimed responsibility for the @entity176 slayings			0
