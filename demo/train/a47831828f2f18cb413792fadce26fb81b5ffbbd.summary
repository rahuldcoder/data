-- shortly before the midterm election , i wrote a strategy memo outlining how core @entity5 voters were not yet energized and well - positioned to vote			2
it should n't have been much of a bombshell			2
it simply outlined what everyone already knew : low turnout would equal disaster for @entity12			1
later i wrote a commentary for @entity0 outlining the enormous differential in likely turnout between @entity5 and @entity17 precincts			0
for certain , the @entity18 for @entity12 was a broad and deep drop - off of its inveterate voters			1
when the electorate shrinks , @entity12 lose			1
to succeed , @entity12 must always be expanding the electorate and using every tool in their arsenal to do so			1
this brings me to how i was wrong on @entity26			0
i was wrong to go along with conventional wisdom about how the election was all about rejecting @entity29 , and that it would be wise not to make him a focal point			1
according to exit polls , most voters in fact rejected the idea that their vote was in opposition to @entity29			1
a 45 % plurality said @entity29 had not been a factor in their vote ; 53 % of independent voters and a larger majority ( 55 % ) of moderate voters said @entity29 was not a factor in their vote			1
@entity29 was very much a factor for @entity17			1
but for the broad swath of voters outside of hard partisans , this election was n't about him			0
but for @entity12 , it should have been			1
here is why : according to projections by the @entity56 , turnout in the 2014 midterm elections was the lowest in over six decades , a pathetic 36 %			0
guess which political leader is really good at energizing turnout and expanding the electorate ? in 2008 , candidate @entity29 helped increase turnout to an astonishing 62 % , helping @entity12 win seats up and down the ballot in both red and blue states			1
in 2012 , he did it again , with close to 60 % turnout -- once more winning a majority on his way to winning back - to - back majorities , which has n't been done by a @entity70 in my lifetime			0
he helped @entity12 pick up @entity74 seats even in a year many prognosticators said @entity12 would lose the @entity76			1
no , president @entity29 should n't have been put on a bus tour through the @entity78 , but he certainly should not have been locked away in the @entity79 either			2
there has n't been a better campaigner in either party in over three decades than @entity29			2
when he is on the campaign trail , he can bring stadiums full of voters to their feet , as if at a @entity88 © concert			1
this midterm , @entity12 basically told the best campaigner in our history to go sit in a corner			2
it was n't the right map			0
they essentially told @entity97 not to suit up for game seven because the game was being played in a hostile arena			0
and why did we do that ? because we did n't have the fortitude to stand with him and the accomplishments we should have trumpeted : lower unemployment , declining crime , economic growth that is the envy of the @entity109 , manufacturing growth , a booming auto industry , low gas prices , a record number of people with health insurance , the deficit shrinking as a proportion of @entity118 , and @entity119 dead			0
hell , with a lot less , president @entity120 declared it was " morning in @entity123			0
" " yeah , " you tell me , " but @entity123 do n't feel the economy is getting better			0
" well , you know how not to change that narrative -- by running from our accomplishments			0
the painful truth is , we ran away from the best progressive persuasion voice in our times because the ghost of our country 's original sin still haunts us			1
we looked at that battleground map running through the heart of @entity139 and trembled			0
we ran away from @entity29 instead of fighting , instead of calling to the better angels of the @entity123 electorate			2
we tried to parse our party 's identity , which only reinforced the tribalization of our electorate			0
so we called ourselves " @entity12			2
we all know what that means			0
it only validates the putrid , subtle racism that it is attempting to perfume			0
note to future @entity5 campaigns : there are no @entity156 @entity12 , there are only @entity12 .			1

@entity158 : @entity29 should have spent more time on campaign trail
*democrats* fled from best progressive persuasion voice in our times : @entity165
