what kind of font are you ? which do you find most attractive ? and how can this help with your love life ? this might sound like copy from a cheap dating website			1
but according to @entity10 , a @entity11 designer specializing in typography , our taste in fonts reveals more about us than we 'd expect			1
" fonts form a kind of language of their own , and we are all unconsciously fluent in it , " she says when i visit her studio in @entity15 , north @entity16			1
" each font gives a different message and atmosphere , and we instinctively understand that			1
typefaces have a deep significance for everyone			2
" in other words , they may reveal who we really are			2
smelling fonts @entity10 recently gave a lecture at the @entity34 that explored the complex network of associations triggered by different fonts			1
by way of demonstration , she lines up three bottles on the table , next to a sample of three fonts : @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity47			1
as bizarre as it sounds , my job is to match up the bottles and fonts using only my sense of smell			1
the first bottle , when opened , smells of bubblegum			0
there 's no question that this is @entity45			0
the second gives out the aroma of coffee : @entity46			0
and the last one contains a neutral , @entity47 odor			0
" more than 80 % of people give the same answer , " she says			0
" this shows how deeply typography is embedded in our psyche			0
" @entity10 is working with scientists at the @entity72 at @entity73 to establish the links between certain fonts and our senses , including taste , hearing and smell			1
" we 've found that rounded fonts are commonly associated with deep reds and sweet tastes , " she says			2
" jagged , angular typefaces evoke salty or sour tastes , and harsh sounds			0
" this may be based in evolution			2
when our ancestors were foraging , sweet , sugary foods were the supreme energy source			0
and they used all their senses to identify them			2
" finding love how can all of this be applied to the game of love ? to illustrate , @entity10 takes out another collection of props : candy bags with different fonts pinned to the outside			1
this time , my job is to choose the one that best reflects my personality , and the one that would represent a desirable partner			1
i think for a moment , and decide that @entity108 is the most " me "			0
inside the bag -- in addition to font - shaped candy -- is a description of my personality			1
" you are a traditionalist , your news comes via the @entity116 and you use correct grammar in texts and tweets , " it says			0
" your ability to communicate clearly and in a friendly tone of voice will being future opportunities your way			0
" this analysis is based on the cultural context of the @entity108 font , which was created in 1926 by @entity128 , who was inspired by @entity131 's iconic @entity130 typeface			1
it was quickly adopted by @entity133 and @entity134 , as well as the @entity116			0
so the fact that i was drawn to it , apparently , indicates that i 'm an establishment kind of guy			0
to which i respond : meh			0
what about my ideal partner ? i dither for a moment , then plump for @entity142			2
it seems elegant , characterful and balanced , somehow			0
the perfect type ? my ideal woman , i discover , has " strong ties to [ her ] home but has travel in [ her ] future			1
[ she ] will be influential in the @entity152 "			0
this is because @entity142 , though invented in @entity11 in the 18th century , became extremely popular in @entity154			1
it was @entity157 's favorite font , and was used both on the @entity159 and the @entity160			2
now , my wife has no significant connections to the @entity154			0
but i do write for @entity163 ( whose logo , @entity10 says , is " sweet with a little bit of savory , a little twist of crunch " )			1
perhaps my choice of fonts actually describes my employer ? either way , it is a good idea to try out @entity10 's online font - based personality test			1
admittedly , it 's not completely watertight			0
but it might just increase your chances of finding someone that is just your type			2
for those interested to know more , @entity10 has launched a new series of " tuesday type tastings " in @entity16			1
more from style : biodesign : why the future of our cities is soft and hairy the amazing art on these communist - era houses was a rebellion back then			2

@entity11 designer @entity10 believes our taste in fonts can be very revealing
