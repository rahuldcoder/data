@entity0 -- embattled @entity3 gov. @entity2 forcefully stood by his account that he only found out about notorious traffic lane closures at the @entity6 last year after they appeared in the media and that he knew absolutely nothing about a suggested political motive behind them			1
" the answer is still the same , " @entity2 said in a radio interview on monday night , adding later that he ca n't wait to get the " full story " behind the scandal that has rocked his administration and , for now , has clouded any potential presidential run in 2016			1
" the fact of the matter is i 've been very clear about this			0
before these lanes were closed , i knew nothing about them			0
i did n't plan it			0
i did n't authorize it			0
i did n't approve it			0
i knew nothing about it , " he said in a studio appearance for a live call - in show hosted by @entity3 101.5			0
the fresh response came amid a new allegation from a former top adviser caught up in the scandal , @entity36 , that " evidence exists " that @entity2 knew about the closures and resulting traffic gridlock over five days in @entity40 in real time , which would , if true , contradict his account of events			1
on @entity1 's " @entity47 " @entity40 mayor @entity46 said he believed @entity2 but thought the governor should sign a sworn statement backing up his claims			1
" i take it him at his word but it would appear from the polls that a lot of folks do n't , " @entity46 said			1
why is this important ? @entity2 's recollection ultimately may be critical in answering why the bridge lanes overseen by the @entity60 and @entity3 were closed in the first place and who authorized it for sure -- and whether any laws were broken			2
e-mails and political figures in @entity3 have suggested the gridlock was a bit of orchestrated political payback for the @entity40 mayor , who did not endorse @entity2 for re-election last november			1
a state legislative committee is investigating as is the @entity73 , which would be interested if there was any abuse of power			0
both have subpoenaed @entity2 's office for documents , and he said his office is complying			2
@entity2 's office also has hired a private law firm to investigate			2
and why is @entity36 important ? it has been suggested in the e-mails released by state legislative investigators in @entity3 that @entity36 , a top @entity2 appointee at the @entity60 , carried out the closures			1
he also has been subpoenaed , refused to answer questions from legislative investigators , and he 's got a lawyer			0
for his part , @entity2 has fired a top aide linked to what has metastasized into a political scandal coming on the heels of a successful re-election and prior to a possible @entity97 bid			2
others have left their jobs as the scandal unfolded , including @entity36			0
former deputy chief of staff @entity101 , whose e-mail to @entity36 -- " time for some traffic problems in @entity40 " -- weeks before the gridlock occurred led to her firing by @entity2 in january , refused on monday on constitutional grounds to comply with a state legislative subpoena to turn over documents , a source with knowledge of the matter told @entity1 's @entity114			1
state lawmakers leading that investigation said they are reviewing the matter and " considering our legal options with respect to enforcing the subpoena			0
" @entity2 , in the radio interview , repeated what he said at a january news conference -- challenged by @entity36 in a letter written by his lawyer to the @entity60 on friday -- about the timeline around when he became aware of the traffic mess			1
he also denied having any knowledge of a suggested political motive			0
who 's who in the bridge scandal @entity2 blasts @entity36 " the first time that this really came into my consciousness , as an issue " was when an e-mail from @entity60 executive director @entity140 " was leaked to the media and reported on			2
" @entity140 was the person , according to e-mails , who started asking questions about the lane closures and ordered them reopened			1
that 's when @entity2 said he asked his chief of staff and his chief counsel to " look into this and see what 's going on here			2
" he said any reference to the bridge situation prior to this would n't have meant anything to him because he was n't clued into the fact that there was a problem			0
afterward , @entity2 said again that he was told the " @entity60 was engaged in a traffic study , " which has now been called into serious question			1
he also stressed that " nobody has said i knew anything about this before it happened , and i think that 's the most important question			0
" a question of evidence @entity2 's appearance follows steps by his office over the weekend to strike in an unusually personal way against @entity36 , a one - time high school classmate of the governor in @entity171 , @entity3 " bottom line - @entity36 will do and say anything to save @entity36 , " a letter released by the governor 's office said in a statement			2
on monday , @entity2 's office also planned to send to friends and allies a list of tweets and stories aiming to put the focus on the @entity186 ' handling of the disclosure by @entity36 , according to @entity1 's @entity188			1
the @entity186 broke the story , saying @entity36 " had the evidence to prove " @entity2 knew about the lane closures			1
the newspaper quickly revised its lead to simply reflect what the letter written by @entity36 's attorney actually said : that " evidence exists , " not that @entity36 was in possession of it			0
the letter never disclosed the evidence			0
@entity2 scandal : a primer first on @entity1 : mayor behind @entity2 allegations full of contradictions the letter also did n't suggest that @entity2 had knowledge of what his people might have been up to -- political or otherwise			1
@entity213 's letter the scandal and another allegation of strong - arm political tactics by @entity2 administration officials over @entity219 aid have generated a wave of negative political fallout for a governor overwhelmingly re-elected in november and considered a top - tier @entity224 presidential hopeful in 2016			1
@entity2 's swagger and straight - shooting style had him riding high in the polls as late as december			2
he topped other potential @entity224 2016 @entity97 hopefuls in various surveys			0
but those numbers have faded as the scandal has intensified , according to a new @entity1 / @entity234 survey			0
@entity2 trails @entity235 by 16 percentage points in a hypothetical presidential match - up , a turnaround from december when he was up by 2 points			2
opinion : are clouds gathering for @entity2 ? @entity2 to appear at @entity243 @entity1 's @entity244 , @entity245 , and @entity114 contributed to this report .			1

new : @entity40 mayor : " i take it him at his word but it would appear *...* a lot of folks do n't "
@entity2 sticks to story that he first heard about lane closures from media reports
governor again says he was told *initially* the traffic mess was part of a traffic study
@entity1 poll shows @entity2 support in potential presidential race *slides*
