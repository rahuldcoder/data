-- contaminated and polluted water now kills more people than all forms of violence including wars , according to a @entity7 report released monday that calls for turning unsanitary wastewater into an environmentally safe economic resource			1
" at the beginning of the 21st century , the world faces a water crisis , both of quantity and quality , caused by continuous population growth , industrialization , food production practices , increased living standards and poor water use strategies , " the report by the @entity11 says			2
as a result , " it is essential that wastewater management is considered as part of integrated , ecosystem - based management that operates across sectors and borders , freshwater and marine			0
" the report defines wastewater as a combination of fertilizer runoff , sewage disposal and other animal , agricultural and industrial wastes			2
wastewater a deadly threat according to the report -- titled " @entity48 ? " -- 90 percent of wastewater discharged daily in developing countries is untreated , contributing to the deaths of some 2.2 million people a year from diarrheal diseases caused by unsafe drinking water and poor hygiene			1
at least 1.8 million children younger than 5 die every year from water - related diseases , the report says			1
but with proper management , the report notes , " wastewater can be an essential resource for supporting livelihoods			1
" for example , some of the chemicals that make wastewater a pollutant , such as nitrogen and phosphorous , can also be useful as fertilizers for agriculture			0
" if the world is to thrive , let alone to survive on a planet of 6 billion people heading to over 9 billion by 2050 , we need to get collectively smarter and more intelligent about how we manage waste , including wastewaters , " said @entity63 , @entity7 under - secretary general and executive director of @entity11			0
despite the staggering statistics included in the report , it " also points to the abundant @entity80 opportunities for turning a mounting challenge into an opportunity with multiple benefits , " @entity70 said , citing reduced fertilizer costs , incentives for conserving such ecological infrastructures as wetlands and salt marshes , and business opportunities in engineering and natural resource management			2
the report acknowledges that such opportunities will require large - scale investments , such as multimillion dollar sewage treatment plants			1
" financing and investment are urgently needed and must address design , ecosystem restoration construction , operation and maintenance of wastewater infrastructure , " the report says			0
but it also offers up simpler solutions , such as education " to ensure water , nutrients and future opportunities for employment and development are not wasted			0
" the report 's release was timed to coincide with @entity110 , an initiative started in 1992 that aims to raise the profile of water quality .			0

@entity7 report : polluted water kills about 2.2 million a year ; wars claim fewer *victims* per year
report also says wastewater could become valued resource if treated
