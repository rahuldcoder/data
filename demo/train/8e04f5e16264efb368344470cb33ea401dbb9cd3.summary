-- monday sees the eagerly awaited publication of " @entity2 , " the authorized biography of the late tech pioneer written by @entity5			1
remarkably -- through leaks of the book 's details in the press and reflections from his friends -- i 've learned more about @entity2 since his passing than i knew during his life			1
what i 've learned is that @entity2 was guided by a very specific worldview -- a set of values that shaped everything he did			1
and i 've begun to think how we can all live more like @entity2 : the @entity23 , perhaps			1
how to be rich @entity2 , despite his financial success , was frugal			1
according to @entity5 , a former chairman of @entity0 , @entity2 said of money , " i did not want to live that nutso lavish lifestyle that so many people do when they get rich			2
" as a result , @entity2 's home was n't particularly huge and he famously embraced minimalism			1
" i saw a lot of other people at @entity34 , especially after we went public , how it changed them			0
" , @entity2 said in a recorded interview			2
" and a lot of people thought that they had to start being rich			0
i mean , a few people went out and bought @entity40 , and they bought homes , and their wives got plastic surgery			0
i saw these people who were really nice simple people turn into these bizarro people			0
and i made a promise to myself to myself , i said i 'm not gon na let this money ruin my life			0
" @entity2 was n't completely opposed to having expensive things , however : he drove a @entity51			2
how to dress @entity2 's frugality showed in his simple wardrobe , too : a pair of jeans and a black turtleneck			1
@entity2 embraced this look for its simplicity -- allowing him , perhaps , to focus on more important things			2
" he also came to like the idea of having a uniform for himself , both because of its daily convenience ( the rationale he claimed ) and its ability to convey a signature style , " @entity5 said of @entity2 's look			1
@entity2 had enough of the turtlenecks to wear them for his entire life			1
his frugality played into @entity2 ' clothing choices as well			2
former @entity78 chairman @entity77 recalled in his blog this week a meeting he had with @entity2 on a bitterly cold day in @entity81			2
@entity77 noticed @entity2 did not have a coat , and the two went to a clothing store to purchase one			2
@entity2 found a coat he liked , but balked at the price			2
" that much for an overcoat ? too much			0
besides , i 'll never use it in @entity91 , " he said			0
the pair left the store , with @entity2 tolerating the freezing cold rather than spending money on a coat he would n't wear again			2
how to handle authority living like @entity2 involves having a healthy disregard for authority			1
@entity2 ' penchant for breaking the rules was best summarized in @entity34 's 1997 " think different " ad campaign : " here 's to the crazy ones			1
the round pegs in the square holes			0
the ones who see things differently			0
they 're not fond of rules			0
and they have no respect for the status quo			0
" @entity2 questioned authority his entire life , even choosing to drive without license plates			1
@entity5 asked @entity2 why he did n't have plates , to which @entity2 initially replied it was for privacy reasons			1
when informed that having no license plates would actually attract attention , @entity2 replied that he did n't have license plates because he did n't have license plates			1
how to die @entity129 ' philosophy on death was that it may ultimately be a good thing : " nature 's change agent , " he called it			1
in a 2005 @entity134 commencement speech , @entity2 said of death : " remembering that i 'll be dead soon is the most important tool i 've ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life			1
because almost everything -- all external expectations , all pride , all fear of embarrassment or failure -- these things just fall away in the face of death , leaving only what is truly important			0
remembering that you are going to die is the best way i know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose			0
" and yet @entity2 may have altered his views as he faced his own mortality			0
according to @entity5 , @entity2 said he was " 50 - 50 " on whether he believed in @entity156			0
" ever since i 've had cancer i 've been thinking about it more -- and i find myself believing a bit more			0
i kind of , maybe it 's because i want to believe in an afterlife , that when you die , it does n't just all disappear			0
the wisdom you 've accumulated			0
but sometimes i think it 's just like an on - off switch -- click and you 're gone , " @entity2 said			1
" and that 's why i do n't like putting on - off switches on @entity34 devices			0
" to live -- and to die -- like @entity2 , then , is to live simply , to challenge the norm , to never let success change you			1
most of all , it 's to live in the knowledge that you 're going to die			0
as @entity2 said of mortality : " your time is limited , so do n't waste it living someone else 's life			1
