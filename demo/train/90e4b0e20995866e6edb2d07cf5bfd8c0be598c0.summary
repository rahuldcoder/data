-- @entity1 crashed out of the @entity2 after a surprise defeat at the hands of @entity7 sixth seed @entity5 , ending the world @entity9 's hopes of winning a record sixth title in the professional era			1
@entity5 won 7 - 6 ( 7 - 1 ) 6 - 4 3 - 6 6 - 3 in under three hours in wednesday 's evening session to reach the semifinals for the first time at @entity16			1
" i just did n't come up with the goods tonight , " said @entity1 , in quotes carried on the official tournament website , after his first match in four days following a walkover against @entity22 @entity21			2
" he probably created more than i did , and that 's why he ended up winning			0
" @entity26 to face @entity27 in @entity2 semis @entity1 made his earliest exit in @entity30 since 2003 and now has an 11 - 5 record against the 26 - year - old -- who beat him at the @entity34 and at @entity35 in 2010 , when he went on to lose in the final			1
@entity5 will face @entity38 champion @entity37 in the last four , after the @entity39 came back from a set down to oust giant @entity42 @entity41 , winning 3 - 6 7 - 6 ( 7 - 4 ) 6 - 2 6 - 0			1
@entity41 , who will be left to rue a number of missed opportunities , surrendered a 5 - 1 lead in the second set			2
this proved to be a turning point for the resurgent @entity37 , who finally found his rhythm as his confidence grew			2
all of a sudden , he had answers to the 12th seed 's massive serve and booming forehand as he breezed through the next two sets to earn a place in the semis			2
the match had been moved from the main @entity58 to the @entity60 court , and 2008 @entity2 finalist @entity37 struggled in front of an initially small crowd against a player who beat him at the same tournament three years ago			1
" you have to be able to create your own atmosphere when you 're on the court , but i did play better when the crowd filled up , " said @entity37 , still seeking his first grand slam title after losing to @entity1 in july 's @entity35 final			1
" it 's a quicker court			0
when you switch from one court to the other , it can take time to get into a rhythm			0
i have never played particularly well on that court			0
" earlier , 2009 @entity2 champion @entity77 brought the curtain down on @entity80 's glittering career by beating the home favorite in four sets in their rain - delayed fourth - round match on @entity84			1
@entity80 , the last @entity22 male to win a grand slam when he triumphed in @entity30 in 2003 , announced last week that it would be his last tournament			2
the former world no. 1 met his match against the seventh - seeded @entity90 , who will play defending champion @entity91 in the quarterfinals			1
when play resumed after being tied at 6 - 6 in the first set from tuesday , @entity80 took the tiebreaker but he could make no further progress against the 23 - year - old @entity38 bronze medalist			1
there were no breaks of service in the second , but @entity77 took the tiebreaker and then proceeded to dominate , completing a 6 - 7 ( 1 - 7 ) 7 - 6 ( 7 - 4 ) 6 - 2 6 - 4 victory			2
@entity80 was visibly emotional in the final game on the @entity105 and received a huge ovation from the crowd as he bowed out			2
" playing the last five games was pretty hard			0
once i got down a break , i could barely look at my ( players ) box , " @entity80 said			0
" i do n't know what the emotions are			0
i 'm a little overwhelmed right now			0
i normally feel like i can grasp things pretty quickly and clearly			0
i certainly do n't feel that way right now			0
" world no. 2 @entity91 had easier progress , as his opponent @entity118 was forced to retire when trailing by two sets and 3 - 1 in the third			1
the @entity121 18th seed complained of feeling ill as the rain - delayed match came to a swift conclusion			0
" it 's an unfortunate situation that happened with him , but i felt that i was hitting the ball well in the last two sets before that happened , " said @entity91 , who reached his sixth successive @entity2 quarterfinal , having dropped just 20 games in four matches			1
" hopefully i can keep that going for the next match			0
" his fellow @entity134 , eighth seed @entity135 , reached the last eight at @entity16 for the second straight year as he eased past @entity138 's no. 19 @entity137 of @entity138 6 - 3 7 - 6 ( 7 - 5 ) 6 - 2			0
he will next play @entity140 fourth seed @entity139 , who has been in equally fine form in the final grand slam of the season .			1
