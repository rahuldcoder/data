@entity0 -- let 's play spot the villain			2
on monday , a group of children from @entity6 in @entity7 , @entity8 , received an unexpected message in their @entity11 sermon			1
the reverend @entity12 , a trainee vicar , shared with them the simple truth that @entity15 does n't exist			1
the real meaning of @entity11 , she said , was n't @entity15 , @entity17 and @entity18			1
it was about the birth of the baby jesus and the light that he brought to the world			0
one posted on @entity25 that @entity12 had " put me off taking my children to church just in case something else gets said			0
" this was the second such incident this month			0
a few weeks ago , when father @entity33 , a devoted , octogenarian catholic priest , dared to -- shock horror -- tell children the truth at church , a local headmaster by the name of @entity40 intervened			0
" i want to reassure all @entity42 pupils at @entity43 's , and their parents , that i have personally spoken to @entity11 and told him about what has happened , " he lied			1
" he was sorry to hear about the confusion and has promised me that he will arrange for his elves to write to each of the children and reassure them that he will definitely be coming to visit them this @entity11			1
" so who are the real villains here ? father @entity33 , @entity53 and their inconvenient truth - telling ? @entity56 and the disgruntled parents ? in my view , anybody in their right mind will side with the clergy			1
over recent decades , @entity15 worship has got out of hand			1
rather than a light - hearted part of festive make - believe , it has become an elaborate con that many parents insinuate into their children 's lives			1
a @entity8 mother , @entity71 , made the headlines when she filmed her children crying after writing them a note -- ostensibly from @entity15 -- saying that they would not receive any " lovely presents " this year because they were on the big bully 's " naughty list			1
" one of the children was eight years old			0
and he still fell for it			0
this may be an extreme example , but it reflects the extent to which most children have been conned			0
it has become standard practice for parents to pretend to be in contact with @entity15 by letter and telephone before @entity11			1
these days , almost every parent in @entity8 puts out a glass of sherry " for @entity15 " and mince pies " for the reindeer " on christmas eve , before consuming them as the children sleep , to create the illusion that @entity15 " has visited			1
" a similar tradition flourishes in the @entity101 and elsewhere			2
a mother i know even told her son that a shooting star was @entity15 coming to deliver presents on his sleigh			1
another example of the depth of the deception came earlier this month , when a small girl called @entity112 asked a @entity114 spokesman at a news conference if he was " tracking @entity15			2
" the answer , believe it or not , was yes : the @entity118 ( @entity118 ) has a website claiming to monitor @entity15 's progress using their advanced detection systems over @entity11			1
that 's just a bit of fun , of course , and harmless in its way			0
but in the context of the @entity131 , it takes on a different hue			0
is it really right that children should believe that this stuff is , so to speak , gospel ? it 's madness			0
somehow , parents have gone beyond the light - hearted @entity15 of decades past , and are intent on manipulating their children into actually believing that he exists			1
the energy and forethought that some people expend on @entity15 propaganda is astonishing			2
and who is @entity15 , anyway ? a blend of @entity148 , @entity149 , @entity150 and north @entity151 folklore -- some of it @entity152 and some of it @entity156 -- popularized in the 1930s by a @entity159 advertising executive ( with the unlikely name of @entity161 )			2
do n't get me wrong : i have no problem with the @entity15 ritual as a sort of game , allowing children to believe or disbelieve as they like			1
but messing with your kid 's reality -- that stinks			0
what 's wrong with it , i hear you ask ? what possible harm could it do ? is n't it all a bit of festive fun , that makes children 's @entity11 more special ? well , there are several problems with the cult of @entity15			1
firstly , the man is a lie			0
quite literally , a big , fat lie			0
and selling lies to your children is n't a good thing , unless in exceptional circumstances			0
in fact , i 'd go so far as to call it an abuse of trust , especially if you use it to frighten your kids into " being good			0
" secondly , propagating the @entity15 myth is profoundly cynical			2
at the heart of the con is the tacit belief that the world is not magical enough on its own , that it has to be sexed up with a @entity15			2
from this point of view , explaining the truth about how shooting stars are formed would be boring , and revealing that the presents come from mummy and daddy would be a downer ; kids need to believe in a fantasy figure if they 're going to have a magical @entity11			1
how jaded ! surely it is far more awe - inspiring , not to mention instructive , to explain that a shooting star is a speck of spacedust bursting into flame up as it plummets through the @entity221 's atmosphere			2
surely it is more meaningful to understand that your parents have bought you presents with love , rather than outsourced the job to an elderly man with a team of elves and reindeer behind him			0
lastly , @entity15 has become the icon of materialism			2
presents are a significant part of @entity11 , but we can all agree that they should have more to do with togetherness and goodwill than with imaginary old men and booty			2
now , i 'm not religious myself , but it does n't take a genius to make the correlation between the decline of organized religion in recent decades , and the rise of the @entity15 movement			1
it seems like if you remove formalized faith from children 's lives , it must be replaced by an equally powerful belief in something else			0
@entity256 may be dead -- but @entity15 lives			2
if my kids were going to believe in anything , however , i 'd much rather it was @entity256 than @entity15			1
at least there is a long , rich tradition behind @entity256			0
at least he is synonymous with a complex moral and ethical code			0
at least he can offer some kind of genuine spiritual solace to those that believe in @entity267			0
unlike that villainous old red - belly			0
read : sick kids fly to @entity270 to see @entity15			1

several priests have recently told kids that @entity15 is n't real
parents lash out at " *killjoys* " *ruining* the spirit of @entity11
@entity278 says it 's all very well to have it as a make - believe tradition
many parents now go too far in fooling their kids into believing in him , he says
