@entity3 caught it in midair and lobbed it back			1
the explosion -- in the battlefield of social media -- injured the truth			0
@entity0 , the conservative media magnate , never afraid to ruffle liberal feathers , tweeted that @entity13 " must be held responsible " for " their growing jihadist cancer			1
" @entity3 , the creator of @entity16 , deployed her rhetorical mastery			1
" i was born @entity18 , " she tweeted back			1
" if that makes @entity0 my responsibility , i 'll auto - excommunicate			1
" at last count , more than 20,000 people had re-tweeted her			0
the comedian @entity23 shot back , " @entity24 can we get a step by step guide ? how can my 60 year old parents in @entity27 help destroy terrorist groups ? plz advise			1
" there are few subjects as sensitive -- as easy to get wrong -- as the role of @entity32 and the responsibility of the world 's @entity13 in the terrorist barbarism plaguing much of the world today			1
muslims , all @entity13 , are not responsible for what happened			1
but that 's not the end of it			0
@entity44 , @entity23 and the tens of thousands who favorite their tweets are right in saying this is not the fault of all @entity13 , nor is it exclusively up to them , all of them , to take on the battle			1
but the tweets leave out a fundamental part of the problem			0
@entity13 have a crucial role to play in fighting extremist acts committed in the name of their religion and , indeed , many of them are doing it			1
from social media to the highest spheres of power , there are @entity13 demanding reform , demanding reaffirmation of individual freedoms and rejecting violence			1
@entity23 's parents need not drop everything they 're doing and head for the fight against @entity74			1
but individuals , in this era of high connectivity , can argue for their beliefs			0
@entity23 , for one , with a large following and gift for communicating his views , has the ability to advance the conversation away from both extremes			1
there are people to persuade on all sides , not just that @entity0 is wrong , but also that the ideology of the terrorists is wrong			1
a @entity92 poll of 14,244 people in 14 countries with large @entity32 populations revealed a few months ago , significant minorities of @entity13 believe suicide bombings are " justified to defend @entity32 from its enemies			1
" in @entity98 47 % said suicide bombings are acceptable , in @entity100 62 % agreed , in @entity101 24 % did			0
those are alarming numbers , a sign that murderous extremism is indeed a problem , one that @entity13 should view with urgency , not least because the vast majority of suicide bombings , of terrorism of all kinds , kills @entity13			1
thousands of @entity13 , including @entity111 , have joined the viciously violent @entity74 which , by some accounts , enjoys the support of a rather large minority of @entity116 and @entity111 muslims			2
that is excellent news for @entity111 's extreme right - wing politicians , who have built their careers on racism and religious prejudice -- most recently against @entity13 and immigrants from @entity32 countries -- and have found a populist sweet spot in the carnage			2
after the killings at @entity129 and the subsequent siege and murder of @entity133 shoppers at a @entity135 market , the stage is set for anti-immigrant parties to make gains in @entity111			0
and the barbarism ranges well beyond : hundreds of schoolgirls kidnapped in @entity140 by the @entity142 terrorist group , @entity141 , whose name applies the @entity32 term " @entity141 " -- what is forbidden -- to @entity141 , a word used to described a @entity148 education			0
even as the media was focused on @entity150 , @entity141 slaughtered thousands more in @entity140 , including many children , wiping out entire villages			0
these attacks should bring together a coalition spanning the political spectrum , including @entity13 , @entity18 and @entity133 , conservatives and liberals , the overwhelming majorities of whom favor the defense of personal freedoms			1
and @entity13 should stand in the vanguard of that coalition , with their arms thrown across the shoulders of @entity133 , signifying rejection of the intolerance that has made itself at home among far too many of their coreligionists			2
there is a war of ideas raging in the @entity32 world			0
the prize is the soul of modern @entity32			0
it 's not enough to say this is not my fault			0
terrorists say they fight on behalf of @entity13			2
muslims can not be mere bystanders			0
but there is a well - meaning segment of the population , particularly among the left , that stubbornly tries to deny the religious context of the terrorist attacks and the need for it to be addressed within @entity32 communities			0
by doing this , the left and the center push people to the right -- that is , people who agree with @entity0 's views			2
this is because many voters know the denial is dishonest or blind			0
those who close their eyes to the religiously - inspired motivation of the killers , and of their religion - inspired goals , are just as mistaken			0
are all @entity13 responsible ? are they guilty ? no , of course not			1
do they have a responsibility to help fight this growing threat ? yes , absolutely yes			0
in some respects , it is reminiscent of the role of the @entity213 people in the aftermath of @entity215 's @entity213 are not guilty of what their parents and grandparents did			2
but they have a special role in preventing a resurgence of those odious and dangerous views			2
it 's not islamophobic to acknowledge that most of the terrorism we see today is being perpetrated by people who say they want @entity228 , @entity32 law , that they want a @entity32 caliphate , that they reject modernity in favor of life in the way of the @entity234 's day			0
we have seen @entity74 -- the self - styled caliphate or " @entity240 " -- kidnapping , raping and enslaving women ; beheading hostages , @entity111 and @entity239 -- but mostly @entity13			2
@entity142 terrorists , organizations committed to imposing their views of what their religion commands , are killing without mercy in @entity247 , @entity248 , @entity101 , @entity249 , @entity250 , @entity251 , @entity252 , @entity116 , @entity253 , @entity254 , @entity255 and elsewhere			0
only the perpetrators , their supporters and their enablers are guilty			0
do n't let anyone use the tragedy to score political points or to denigrate @entity13 as a whole			2
but do n't deny the truth : there is a dangerous problem within @entity32 that must be addressed by @entity13 with the support of the rest of the world			2
both extremes in this discussion have it wrong , and by perpetuating their distortions they harm efforts to protect tolerance from the intolerant ; to make the world safe for @entity13 and @entity275 -- for everyone , including those lobbing grenades backs and forth in social media .			1

@entity281 : @entity0 tweet : @entity13 must be accountable for jihadist ' cancer '
@entity3 , @entity23 tweet : are all @entity18 accountable for evil done by some ?
@entity288 : both extremes wrong . all @entity13 not guilty , but must play role in fighting jihadists
