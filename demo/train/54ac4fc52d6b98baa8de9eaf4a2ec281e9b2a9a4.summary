@entity0 -- a prominent @entity3 civil liberties group held a small rally friday outside @entity0 police headquarters , continuing its call for the resignation of police commissioner @entity8 and other reforms within the department			1
the @entity11 wants @entity8 to step down because of his participation in a film that they say paints all @entity3 as terrorists			2
" due to the fact that the police commissioner and mayor ( @entity23 ) @entity22 both refuse to accept the severity of their actions , or meet with local @entity29 leaders in an attempt to mend the situation , we as a community with full force must stand up to the mistreatment and dismissal of our community at large , " the group 's website said			2
" silence and lack of reaction to this pressing issue will only allow this type systematic persecution of a minority community to continue and escalate without any reprimand			0
" @entity3 activists say " @entity47 , " a documentary about radical @entity29 , vilifies the @entity50 - @entity3 community and teaches police officers to suspect @entity3 as terrorists			1
@entity3 activists have also called for deputy police commissioner @entity53 to resign , saying he first denied and only later admitted that @entity8 was interviewed for the film			1
" they were not telling the truth about their involvement in the propaganda film against @entity3 , " said @entity55 , executive director of the @entity11 , adding that @entity0 " deserves people they trust who do not discriminate against people			0
" the film 's producer , @entity63 , said in a statement that the film accurately portrays radical islam : " those that have blasted the film are attempting to stifle an important debate about the internal state of the @entity3 community in @entity50 , and whether politicized @entity29 and indoctrination pose tangible security threats , " @entity63 said			2
according to documents obtained by @entity79 's @entity78 , the film was screened during a @entity81 terrorism training course that more than 1,000 officers attended			1
in a statement released last week , @entity8 acknowledged that he had been interviewed for the film five years ago by a filmmaker and , " while it never became part of the department 's curriculum , and was not authorized for any training , " the film had been screened " for an extended period in 2010 " in a room where officers were on break from training			1
according to the statement , the screening stopped after an officer who was offended by it brought it to department officials ' attention			0
" i offer my apologies to members of the @entity105 , in particular , who would find the film inflammatory and its airing on @entity81 property , though unauthorized , to be inappropriate , " @entity8 said			1
@entity55 said the police commissioner 's apology was not enough			0
