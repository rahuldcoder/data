@entity0 , @entity1 -- in @entity0 , " no guns " signs outnumber ones that say , " no smoking			1
" @entity7 made that telling observation in her blog a few days back			2
she witnessed men drawing weapons while arguing on the street			2
" seeing men shouting , waving guns and pointing them at each other just because of a silly argument is frightening , " she wrote			2
a year after the start of the @entity1 revolution , human rights groups describe a nation of lawless militias who commit crimes with impunity and threaten to destabilize the nation by hindering efforts to rebuild			1
@entity27 said abuses committed by militias amount to war crimes and the monitoring group called on @entity1 authorities to rein them in			1
otherwise , @entity27 said , the risks @entity1 took to demand justice in their homeland , could end up being in vain			1
a year ago , @entity1 dared to take to the streets of @entity39 , their simmering anger heated to a boil by the arrest of human rights lawyer @entity43			1
as many as 2,000 protesters gathered outside of government offices			2
they chanted slogans against @entity47 , the man who had ruled them with a firm grip for four decades			0
it was unimaginable then that he could ever be ousted from power			0
but the @entity1 persisted , inspired by their neighbors to the east and west			1
they called for a " @entity55 " on february 17			0
after that , the protests intensified and spread and eight long months later , after brutal fighting and a @entity60 air campaign , @entity47 was defeated			0
this week , @entity1 could hardly believe a year has passed by			1
since october , when @entity47 was captured and killed , many aspects of life seem normal			0
but in important ways , @entity1 has foundered			1
perhaps the nation is no different than any other that is recovering from trauma and massive upheaval			0
frustration is palpable on the streets , as is an unease about what the future might hold			0
as @entity1 prepare to celebrate their freedom , revolutionary fighters in the capital are on high alert and additional checkpoints have sprouted everywhere			1
ordinary @entity1 cling to the optimism that blossomed with the first protests in @entity39 last february			1
building a nation after four decades of tyranny is no easy task , they say			0
at the main plaza that @entity47 called @entity85 ( it 's now known as @entity86 ) , revolutionary music blares from cars			2
but many still fear former regime loyalists might try to disrupt anniversary celebrations or somehow still destroy the new @entity1			1
in recent days , text messages have circulated among former regime loyalists calling for their own uprising to " liberate ( @entity0 ) from the @entity60 revolution			2
" videos by what is being self described as the @entity1 " resistance " have also emerged on social media sites			1
only 17 % of @entity1 feel people can be trusted , found an @entity103 poll , touted as the first national survey of @entity1 and startling in some of its revelations			1
consider that only 29 % of @entity1 said they would prefer to live in a democracy ; 35 % said they would still prefer rule by a strong leader			1
and 16 % of the 2,000 @entity1 surveyed were ready to resort to violence for political ends			1
that means 630,000 people are potential fighters , in addition to the 280,000 people who previously picked up a gun			0
the revolutionary militias on the streets call themselves their nation 's heroes			1
they are the ones who drove out @entity47 , after all			0
they insist on retaining arms to protect their revolution , especially given that military and police presence is virtually nonexistent			2
@entity129 , 28 , says @entity1 's government is weak ; its defenses not strong enough			1
the nation needs a government that can quickly integrate revolutionary factions under one umbrella ; one that can activate a functioning judiciary			0
recruit a national army , he says			2
without strong national reconciliation measures , @entity129 fears that @entity1 will risk civil war			1
" i am hoping for the best every day , " he says			0
and is not alone in his fears			0
criticism has been rising of the @entity144 and the performance of the interim government			0
many @entity1 say they are frustrated with the slow pace of rebuilding , not unusual for a nation almost starting from scratch			1
but the question is will the @entity1 government be able to maintain confidence of its people ? other @entity1 decry the lack of transparency in decision - making and the government 's inability to impose authority over the the militias			1
@entity0 residents complain of daily cuts in electricity and an ill - equipped health care system			0
some of that frustration has surfaced very publicly			0
last month angry protesters stormed the @entity144 headquarters in @entity39 and the deputy head of the council , @entity167 resigned from his post amid the protests			0
government officials argue that they have inherited a mess left behind from the four decades of @entity47 rule			0
they have pleaded for patience			0
@entity178 , the former spokesman for the @entity179 , an umbrella group of the armed factions in the capital , blames the current situation on the lack of leadership by the civilian authority			1
" there is a feeling growing that the @entity144 is not doing enough towards driving this revolution from phase one to phase two in this transitional period , " he says			2
@entity1 have only to look at @entity191 to see how prickly the revolutionary journey can be			1
" it is a government with no real power and what it really needs is to have a partnership with the guys who are on the ground and make them a part of this state , " @entity178 says			0
voters are set to go to the polls at the end of june to pick a national assembly that will be tasked with drafting a constitution			2
the goal before was to get rid of @entity47			0
now , @entity1 's leaders will have to unify the nation with new goals -- ones that respect the enormous sacrifices of the @entity1 people , @entity178 says			1
" we need to be faithful to their sacrifices to our country and to ... remember the goal of this revolution was not one to get rid of the @entity47 regime and to create chaos , " he says			2
" this would be a disaster , an ultimate betrayal to our guys who fell in the fight for freedom and to establish an advanced modern state			0
" the objectives may seem lofty at times , but friday , @entity1 are taking stock in what they have already gained			1
" we never believed that this revolution will come and now it 's a reality so we feel like we are in a dream , " says minister of planning @entity231			1
journalist @entity235 , however , knows it 's very real			2
he no longer has to dote on each word , consider its consequences			0
no one bothers him after he publishes an article			0
the @entity39 writer erupts in stinging statements about @entity47 's neglect of @entity1			1
" i can express myself , " he says			0
