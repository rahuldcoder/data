jury selection was minutes away for five ex-new @entity2 police officers accused of shooting unarmed civilians after @entity4 when a commenter ripped into the defendants on a newspaper website			1
" none of these guys should had have [ sic ] ever been given a badge , " the commenter , identified only as " legacyusa , " wrote			2
" we should research how they got on the police department , who trained them , who supervised them and why were they ever been promoted			0
you put crap in -- you get crap out ! ! ! " " @entity26 " turned out to be one of the top federal prosecutors in @entity2			2
his post was just one of many anonymous barbs that led a federal judge tuesday to throw out the convictions of those ex-cops in the @entity34 shootings , which left two people dead and four seriously wounded			1
in a 129 - page ruling , district judge @entity36 cited long list of " egregious and inflammatory " comments by at least three @entity41 officials using a variety of online identities			2
those comments fueled a " 21st century carnival atmosphere " that tainted the 2011 trial and will require a new one , @entity36 wrote			1
" this case started as one featuring allegations of brazen abuse of authority , violation of the law and corruption of the criminal justice system ; unfortunately , though the focus has switched from the accused to the accusers , it has continued to be about those very issues , " the order states			1
" after much reflection , the court can not journey as far as it has in this case only to ironically accept grotesque prosecutorial misconduct in the end			1
" in a statement issued tuesday afternoon , the @entity41 said , " we are disappointed with the court 's ruling			0
we are reviewing the decision and considering our options			0
" the five officers were charged with firing on an unarmed family at the @entity2 bridge and at others who were attempting to flee the scene , which unfolded six days after @entity4 flooded most of the city			0
they were found guilty on a total of 25 counts of civil rights violations , and in 2012 , @entity36 sentenced them to prison terms ranging from six to 65 years			0
@entity41 rules forbid prosecutors from making public comments that might influence the outcome of a case			0
but lawyers for the convicted officers accused prosecutors of mounting " a secret public relations campaign " aimed at discrediting the defendants before trial			1
" the government 's actions , and initial lack of candor and credibility thereafter , is like scar tissue that will long evidence infidelity to the principles of ethics , professionalism and basic fairness and common sense necessary to every criminal prosecutor , wherever it should occur in this country , " @entity36 wrote in granting them a new trial			2
" given the time , effort and energy invested by the court in this matter from the beginning , this is indeed a bitter pill to swallow , " he added			1
two top lieutenants of then - @entity118 attorney @entity117 -- the office 's top trial lawyer , @entity121 , aka " legacyusa " and other handles ; and @entity122 , the first assistant @entity118 attorney -- had already been identified as having posted disparaging comments anonymously			0
@entity41 , @entity126 agree on overhaul @entity121 had been trash - talking the @entity126 from then - superintendent @entity128 on down since at least 2008 , tuesday 's order states			1
six months before the @entity34 trials opened , with other officers on trial for their conduct in the @entity136 chaos , @entity121 called the @entity126 " a collection of self - centered , self - promoting , insular , arrogant , overweening , prevaricating , libidinous fools ... the entire agency should be re-engineered from the ground up			1
" the third official cited in the order was @entity144 , a senior attorney in the @entity41 's civil rights division			2
in the @entity34 case , @entity144 had led the department 's " taint team " -- the group charged with reviewing evidence to make sure no statements given under a grant of immunity get used against defendants			1
though not part of the prosecution , she posted to the @entity157 six times during the trial to praise pro-prosecution commenters , according to @entity36 's order			2
@entity144 told investigators she was trying to get information " otherwise unavailable from the prosecution team , " the order states			1
but @entity36 said it was " difficult to accept " that explanation and said she " fanned the flames " of those calling for a guilty verdict			2
@entity122 and @entity121 have left since their involvement was revealed in 2012 , said @entity174 , a spokeswoman for the @entity118 attorney 's office			0
the @entity41 did not immediately respond to questions about @entity144			0
former officer @entity178 got the longest sentence of the @entity34 defendants , at 65 years			1
the lightest term went to former detective sgt. @entity182 , who was sentenced to six years for attempting to cover up what the officers had done			0
two former sergeants , @entity186 and @entity187 , got 40 - year terms for their roles			0
ex-officer @entity190 was sentenced to 38 years			0
@entity191 up , @entity2 looks to shake @entity193 title			0

justice official " fanned the flames " during trial , judge says
a federal judge *tosses* @entity34 convictions over " grotesque " misconduct
" this is indeed a bitter pill to swallow , " the judge wrote
