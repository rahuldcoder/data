@entity0 , @entity1 -- a speaker claiming to be terrorism mastermind @entity4 warned in an audiotape aired friday that the release of two @entity8 journalists abducted by militants hinges on @entity8 's military role in @entity11			1
" we repeat the same message to you , " said the speaker in an audiotape played on the @entity15 satellite news network			1
" the release of your prisoners from the hands of our brethren depends on the withdrawal of your soldiers from our countries			0
" one @entity27 counterterrorism official told @entity2 that the tape " sends a chill up your spine , " as it refers to " a couple of human beings whose lives are at stake			1
" however , the official said it is unclear how much influence @entity4 might have over the fate of the hostages			1
another counterterrorism official said he would not discuss whether it was in fact @entity4 on the latest tape other than to say , " there has never been a recording that has been false " about its claim to be him			1
on the tape , the speaker , believed to be @entity51 chief bin @entity4 , warns the @entity8 government that its alliance with the @entity27 will prove costly			1
" the dismissal of your president ( @entity58 ) @entity57 to get out of @entity11 is the result of his subservience to the @entity27 and this ( dismissal ) is considered to be the green signal to kill your prisoners without delay , " the speaker said			2
he goes on to say that " we will not do that at the time that suits him ( @entity57 ) and this position will cost you dearly on all fronts , in @entity8 and abroad			0
" @entity8 , however , said the message would not deter it from its @entity11 strategy			0
" we are determined to stay in @entity11 with our allies for the @entity11 people , " said @entity74 spokesman @entity73			0
the first @entity27 counterterrorism official told @entity2 that @entity4 's continuing messages serve as a " reminder " and an " in your face " signal that he is still out there			1
but , that official said , " the relevance ( of the tapes ) are on the wane			0
... his message does n't resonate as well			0
" the second @entity27 official said the tape is an effort by @entity4 to prove " he is present , that he is engaging			1
" it 's a " morale factor to remind the people who follow him that he 's still out there , " the second official said			0
but this official said @entity4 's message is more " inspirational " than operational			1
some could take his message as " a directive , " but there is no indication he is " leading " an operation , the official said			0
the official said there has been no change in the @entity27 belief that @entity4 is hiding in @entity109 somewhere along the border with @entity11			2
@entity112 militants captured the journalists -- @entity114 and @entity115 from @entity8 3 television -- in december 2009 and threatened to kill them if their demands were not met , including the release of some detainees held by @entity8			2
@entity8 has 3,750 troops in @entity11 , according to @entity123 's @entity122			0
@entity51 's @entity125 wing has made the same withdrawal demands pertaining to the safety of five @entity8 nationals abducted in @entity129			2
@entity2 's @entity130 and @entity131 contributed to this report .			0
