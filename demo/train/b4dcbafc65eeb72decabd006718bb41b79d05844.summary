@entity0 -- since last year 's @entity7 earthquake , the scenes of devastation and @entity5 nuclear disaster immediately come to mind when people hear " @entity10			1
" few see the beauty of @entity10 's landscape , both before the quake and how it now remains.two photographers , @entity11 and @entity12 , respectively from @entity13 and from @entity14 , are determined to offer artistic alternative			1
" in spring , the mist filled up each and every space in the air			2
in autumn , the falling leaves colored the forest and the sweet scent of maple leaves merged with every breath that i drew in ... and that 's the image of @entity10 that i can recall , " said @entity23 , an amateur @entity13 photographer who went to @entity24 several times before the earthquake			1
" @entity10 after the quake is no longer the @entity10 that i once visited , " said @entity23			1
" despite the sad side of @entity10 , i want to show its peaceful and hopeful side as well			1
the scenes of @entity10 that i 've seen on television are so dark and devastated			1
" @entity23 founded a charity organization called " friends of @entity10 , " which set up three photo exhibitions in @entity13 showing 30 photographs of @entity10 's mountains and lakes for charity			1
earlier this year , $ 12,000 was raised and donated to @entity44 , an anti-nuclear organization in @entity14 , to help the @entity10 nuclear plant workers			1
@entity23 , a 36 - year - old business development manager , discovered @entity10 prefecture 's scenery during a business trip in 2007			1
since then , @entity23 went to @entity10 every year to capture the scenery on film			1
@entity23 says she feels a bond with the prefecture 's environment , including one unforgettable sunrise			2
" i woke up at 3:30 in the morning			0
i waited there for hours with my tripod			0
i witnessed the rising sun gradually lightening up the sky , from dark to dawn to morning			0
i felt so light and relaxed , as if i was merged with nature , " said @entity23			0
rather than looking back in the past , @entity12 chose to show the existing beauty of @entity10			1
right after the quake , @entity12 , who lives in the @entity0 suburb of @entity64 , felt the need to go to the affected areas last april			0
" the world has changed			0
it was n't what it was before , " the 48 - year - old said			0
" i had to see it for myself			0
" without any precise idea of what would be seen in the area , he decided to head to @entity10 to take pictures of " sakura "			1
these @entity14 cherry blossoms are the main theme of his ongoing artistic project since 2001 , consisting largely of photos taken in @entity0 and his neighborhood			1
" @entity84 is planted by people			1
i wanted to see how those people are living and their conditions , " he said			2
his sakura photo series was presented to the @entity89 public in " @entity90 " , his solo exhibition held in @entity92 , august 2011			0
" people who were expecting to see the massive devastation caused by the tsunami and the earthquake might have been disappointed , " he said			2
" those who saw my work as an artistic expression of my feelings told me that they really like my exhibition			2
" @entity12 wanted to show the " unseen " which has not been exposed by the media			0
he believed that , as a photographer , his job is to capture things out of the ordinary rather than what is easily seen			0
some people told him they felt natsukashi , or " nostalgia " in @entity14 , when looking at his pictures			2
being a photographer for 20 years , he observed that artists ' attitude has somewhat changed after this disaster			0
" people seem to realize that things do break and things that humans made get washed away , " he said			2
" the way artists pay tribute has changed			0
their works are sometimes offered to charity organizations and remember what happened			0
