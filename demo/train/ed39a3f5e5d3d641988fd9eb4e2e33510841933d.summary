-- i 'm sitting in a tiny @entity3 apartment , like so many others i 've visited , talking to two parents who sound just like any other happy couple			1
they tell me about the first time they met : " we were madly drawn to each other			0
and i could n't even imagine we would n't be together			0
" they describe their hopes for the future : " as soon as we 're on our feet financially , then we plan to have a second child			0
" but this is not like most other families			2
both parents are women who were both previously married to men			0
their daughter is in another room playing a computer game			0
the women do n't want her to hear the rest of our conversation			0
she 's too young to understand her parents ' fears or why they live in secrecy and have asked us not to publish their names			2
what 's it like to live as a gay family in @entity3 today ? " to be silent			1
that 's it , " one of the women replies			2
not to show , to give basis for rumors in the office			0
to be respected at work you have to keep silent , " her partner adds			0
it 's always been tough to live as a gay person in this country			1
during the @entity49 era gay sex was a crime and the majority of @entity3 remain deeply conservative on gay issues			1
it 's become even harder since parliament passed what 's known as the gay propaganda law in june of last year			1
the legislation makes it illegal to tell children about gay equality			0
read more : what one gay performer thinks of @entity3 's law the law has been widely criticized by @entity66 leaders who have called it archaic and discriminatory			1
human rights activists say it proves @entity3 is unworthy of hosting the @entity69 , which get under way in @entity71 in early february			1
but that has n't stopped the political campaign for another law that would repress gay rights even further			1
in 2013 lawmaker @entity76 proposed a new law that would strip gay people with children of their parenting rights			1
the bill triggered fears the government was about to start taking children from their parents , but stalled in @entity3 's parliament			1
@entity76 is now pushing for a slightly watered down version that would deny custody to any parent who leaves a straight relationship to be gay			0
he says : " in case any parent openly propagates homosexuality and only in this case , if the family splits , a child should exclusively stay with a parent who has heterosexual way of life			0
" @entity76 dismisses @entity66 liberalism and says traditional @entity3 values dictate a child should have a father and a mother			1
" we think on this , @entity3 is on the right path compared to the west , " he says			2
" if you in the west are so tolerant , let @entity3 live with its established traditions			2
" activists say such a law would be another backward step and fear its implementation could gather momentum after the @entity71 games when the world 's focus has shifted away from @entity3			1
@entity120 from @entity121 says the existing gay propaganda law already has the potential to criminalize gay parents			1
" if you 're gay and together with your partner ... you tell your child that your family is just the same , no worse and no better than another family next door , a heterosexual family , than you 'll be violating the law , " @entity120 says			2
back in the tiny apartment , two parents who love their daughter -- and who describe themselves as patriots and @entity138 @entity137 -- say they struggle to imagine a day when the government could take their child from them			0
" i do n't understand how it can be , " one says			0
" i hope it wo n't happen			0
otherwise we 'll have to migrate and many people will make that decision to leave @entity3			2
" these parents feel increasingly pushed into the shadows of @entity3 society , but the couple says they and other gay parents they know are still raising their children with the goal of making their country a better place			1
" as a rule , children in gay families are surrounded by care , attention and respect , " one of the women tells me			2
" i do n't know what kind of people they 'll be in the future , but they 're the children in who the most is being invested			0
