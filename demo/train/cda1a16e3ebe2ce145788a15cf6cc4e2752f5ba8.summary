-- when she was about 8 , @entity1 developed dark folds of skin around her neck			0
it 's a well - known warning sign of type 2 diabetes			2
@entity1 's mother , @entity7 , who has watched other family members struggle with diabetes and obesity , was " devastated " to see her daughter experience similar health problems			1
now at age 11 , @entity15 is about 5 feet , 6 inches tall and weighs around 180 pounds , her mother said			0
despite a high body weight for her age and height , @entity17 does not seem to have additional symptoms of diabetes -- or any other major health concerns -- but her parents are trying to reverse the weight problem @entity17 has had since infancy			1
the @entity28 , @entity29 , family is among a disproportionately high number of @entity33 - @entity32 families with overweight and obese children			1
according to the 2007 @entity36 , 16.6 percent of @entity33 high school students were obese and 18.1 percent were overweight			1
the corresponding national averages for high school students were 13.3 percent obese and 15.8 percent overweight			2
it 's an epidemic that shocked and saddened @entity39 , a chef who appears on @entity40 and @entity41			0
" i travel all over the country to the major @entity33 festivals and i realized that 90 to 95 percent of the kids that i saw at the festivals were overweight , " said @entity42 , who established the @entity46 chef @entity44 program to teach @entity33 youth healthy cooking and eating habits			1
watch @entity42 interact with her fans » the problem is caused by a wide range of cultural , social , economic , environmental and possibly genetic factors			1
experts agree it is an uphill battle to solve			0
" you ca n't just try to change someone 's behavior necessarily without trying to change their environment , " said dr. @entity62 , director of the @entity64 's @entity63			0
how can childhood obesity be reduced ? @entity7 , 38 , believes her own upbringing in @entity72 before coming to the @entity32 in junior high school ultimately contributed to her daughter 's weight problem			1
" the way i was raised ... you do n't [ leave ] the dinner table until you 're done with all your food			0
that 's instilled in you , " @entity1 said			0
back in @entity72 , she said , the food was healthier and fresher , and she did n't drink soda			0
but she still applied that mentality to her own children , who were born and raised in the @entity32 , where sugar - laden and fattening foods are widely available			1
the @entity1 family 's story is similar to that of other immigrants who are healthier than their @entity32 - born children : those born outside the @entity32 are less likely to be obese than native - born children , said @entity93 , @entity94 , of the @entity95			1
despite the trends , more study is necessary to determine whether @entity32 acculturation is entirely to blame for poor diets among @entity101 , an expert says			1
@entity102 , a nutrition and public health professor with the @entity105 , wrote in the june 2009 issue of @entity107 that adaptation to @entity32 society may explain , to some degree , " deterioration of dietary quality " and the risks of diabetes and other chronic diseases			2
however , he wrote , it 's still not completely clear			0
healthy food harder to come by economic factors play a major role for many @entity101 in their weight struggles			1
@entity121 is trying to overcome the obstacle with the @entity124 initiative , a culturally tailored nutrition and exercise program in @entity127 , @entity128			2
as the @entity130 for the @entity131 , @entity129 is trying to get healthy school lunches in the @entity133 , with which she 's working on @entity124			0
about 80 percent of @entity136 's student body , which is 97 percent @entity33 , come from low - income households and therefore are eligible for reduced - price or free lunch			1
without money coming in to support the lunch program , it 's difficult to fund better quality food and equipment to ensure that it 's freshly cooked , @entity129 said			0
for now , she hopes the fun , bilingual setting of @entity124 will teach children to make smart food choices			2
the lack of availability of inexpensive , fresh , healthy food is a common for low - income populations in general , @entity93 said			2
research suggests that more affluent neighborhoods have a higher availability of healthy food , she said , adding that the cost of healthy food is lower in more advantaged communities			0
the community factor exercise also poses tricky problems for @entity33 children struggling with weight , as many live in disadvantaged areas may make it tough for them to play outside or walk to school			1
from a physical point of view -- in terms of sidewalks and litter -- those areas tend to be in worse shape than an average neighborhood , @entity93 said			0
but her research also suggests that the social component of a neighborhood affects children 's physical activity levels			2
" it 's not sufficient to just clean up the neighborhood -- pick up the trash and build sidewalks , " said @entity93 , whose study on the impact of neighborhoods ' social characteristics was published earlier this year in the @entity185			0
" it also needs to be a neighborhood where people feel safe and they feel that they can go out and walk and run and exercise and do whatever they want to do			1
" to that end , @entity93 's research indicates that those @entity101 living in tight - knit communities often get more exercise than those in more mixed neighborhoods			1
" having a neighborhood which is more connected , where people feel safe -- i think it 's all a matter of feeling empowered in a way			1
and so those who feel that they have this stronger neighborhood from a social point of view , they are also more likely to be physically active , " @entity93 said			2
finding solutions researchers and community advocates are attempting to combat the @entity33 youth obesity problem			1
but the multitude of factors makes the issue a moving target and results of interventions are mixed			1
for example , about a year after a previous phase of @entity124 in @entity127 wrapped up , children reportedly ate better and watched less television per day			2
@entity129 said they are awaiting results from the current program , but she has seen some success already			2
@entity64 's @entity62 worked with @entity33 teenagers over 16 weeks to improve their diets , promoting fiber - rich tortillas and altering recipes of aqua fresca so it would have less sugar			1
but at the end of the four months , he saw " no significant improvement in the outcomes			0
" " we have to do those studies over longer time periods than we have previously done to kind of give these things a chance to work and kick in , " @entity62 said			0
" we 're ... taking it one step at a time			0
" and @entity1 's mom , @entity7 , said she is focusing on modifying her own behavior to help her entire family			0
" it 's a retraining of the mind , " @entity1 said			0
" it gets hard because you have to be an example			0

a disproportionately high number of @entity33 - @entity32 families struggle with obesity
programs *designed* *specifically* for @entity33 children have had mixed results
economic factors play a major role for many @entity101 in their weight struggles
exercise , and whether or not children feel safe to play , is another factor
