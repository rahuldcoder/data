-- for the group calling itself freezimactivists it is back to the drawing board after its planned protest against president @entity6 's rule in the style of @entity8 and @entity9 flopped in @entity10			1
the group launched an internet campaign for the so - called @entity10 million citizen march apparently planned for tuesday to protest the 31 - year reign of @entity6			1
but at the @entity17 park which would have been @entity10 's @entity18 it was peaceful and generally empty on tuesday			1
in fact , all the streets of @entity20 were largely empty and peaceful , apparently over people 's fears of being caught up in any protest which might be crushed violently by government allied forces			2
@entity10 's state media made no reference to the planned demonstration that was supposed to be similar to ones that toppled the long - serving leaders of @entity9 and @entity8 last month and caused similar demonstrations throughout the @entity32 and @entity33			1
the @entity35 strongman @entity34 is battling to retain his 41 - year - old dictatorship in the wake of demonstrations in that country			1
armoured cars carrying riot police and water cannon vehicles have been seen shuttling through @entity20 since weekend when news of the planned protests filtered through			1
political analyst @entity45 said the organisers might have announced the date to test the state 's preparedness			0
" i am sure it will happen			0
when it happens , the state structure will be caught napping , " said the @entity52 political scientist			0
" given the way the state responded by bringing out its toys ( armoured cars and police ) you can tell that it was not going to make it easy for the protests			0
" one activist said the planning team and the protesters in @entity10 might have backed off reacting to the riot police patrolling the streets of @entity20			1
" there is need to avoid all the information getting into the hands of those opposed to the cause if the protests are to be anything as what happened in @entity8 or @entity9 , " he said			0
the campaigns in @entity8 and @entity9 were organised on @entity75 and @entity76			0
last week , @entity10 authorities charged 46 people with treason			2
the group was arrested after authorities said they were caught watching footage of the protests that led to the ouster of @entity9 leader @entity85 @entity84 of @entity9 in january and of @entity8 president @entity86 in february			0
" on 16 february they held a meeting and the purpose of the meeting was to organise , strategize and implement the removal of a constitutional government of @entity10 by unconstitutional means , the @entity9 - @entity8 way , " prosecutor @entity87 said in court on thursday			2
at least 12 of the 46 activists were beaten with broomsticks on their buttocks and the soles of their feet , defense attorney @entity97 told a packed courtroom on thursday			0
the charge carries a death sentence in @entity10 .			2
