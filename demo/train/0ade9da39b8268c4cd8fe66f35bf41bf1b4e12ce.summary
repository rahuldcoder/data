-- an 18 - year - old @entity2 monk set himself on fire in a monastery in @entity7 's @entity6 province , according to advocacy organizations and the @entity2 government in exile			1
the teenager , identified as @entity12 , self - immolated , shouted slogans and attempted to march towards the local government 's office in the town of @entity17 around noon tuesday , according to the @entity18 ( @entity18 ) , which functions as the government of @entity2 outside the @entity7 territory			1
it was unclear what @entity12 shouted before he died , according to the @entity24 , a group based in @entity26			0
my take : why the @entity28 can not condemn @entity2 self - immolations @entity12 became the 44th @entity2 to self - immolate since 2009 , according to the @entity18			1
self - immolation has become a common form of protest for @entity2 who want autonomy from @entity7			1
the local police office and county government did not comment on the incident when contacted by @entity0			0
the @entity38 also did not respond to @entity0 's request for information			0
after @entity12 's death , @entity7 forces headed towards the monastery , but local @entity2 blocked a bridge to prevent the police from a possible confrontation , according to @entity18 and several @entity2 advocacy groups			2
@entity12 had been at the @entity48 in @entity49 since he was young , according to the group , @entity51			0
he was described as being " one of the best students " at the monastery			0
an act of faith , desperation or protest earlier in march , two other monks from the same monastery set themselves on fire			1
the group , @entity51 , has described the self - immolations as " a fundamental rejection of @entity7 's occupation			0
" timeline of @entity2 protests in @entity7 the @entity28 has remained silent on the issue of self - immolations , refusing to answer questions earlier this year about whether monks should stop setting themselves on fire in protest			1
@entity73 , an assistant professor in the @entity75 at @entity76 , observed that the @entity2 self - immolators were young and even teens , " which indicates that the new generation of politically aware @entity2 might have lost patience with the @entity28 's nonviolent political philosophy			2
" in essence , these self - immolations are an extreme form of political self - expression			2
they are performed as part of a struggle for recognition , as an autonomous political community , " he wrote in a @entity0 opinion piece			0
@entity92 noted that the self - immolation of a young @entity95 street vendor in 2010 sparked an uprising that spread throughout the @entity98 world , yet dozens of @entity2 self - immolations have yielded little political results			1
my take : @entity28 should condemn self - immolations			0
