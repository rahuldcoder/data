@entity1 's military leaders have nominated a former general considered fiercely loyal to former dictator senior general @entity3 to be the country 's next vice president			1
@entity7 's expected promotion from chief minister of @entity9 to the second highest post in the country has disappointed observers who hoped for a more reform - friendly candidate			1
" the military chose someone who they can count on , " said @entity14 , editor of @entity17 - based @entity16 magazine which covers @entity1 news			0
describing @entity7 as a prodigy of the former dictator , @entity14 said that his selection was not surprising given that the post had to be filled by the military			1
" i think they chose someone who would protect the vested interests of the military and the former dictator			2
so the choice does n't seem surprising but it does n't make anything promising to this reform process , " he said			0
" he 's not noted as a reformer , " said @entity33 , an associate professor at @entity34 in @entity35 , of the 61 - year - old candidate			0
" i think that fact alone will disappoint many people who watch and are closely involved in @entity1			0
" since becoming president in march 2011 , @entity40 has steered @entity1 , which is also known as @entity1 , away from its repressive military past , towards what many hope is a truly democratic future			1
the release of lauded democracy campaigner @entity47 from house arrest and her subsequent election to parliament is the clearest signal yet of @entity40 's commitment to reform			2
@entity47 attends first session of parliament since taking oath however , military men still dominate parliament and any step forward must be navigated with their approval , which has made @entity1 's democratic reform a delicate and difficult process			1
the resignation of the " hardliner " vice president @entity62 early this month handed the military a clear opportunity to convey its view on the direction the country is taking			1
will vice president 's exit boost @entity1 reform efforts ? " i think by appointing someone who is not an overt reformer they 're sort of signaling i think what we understand to be their current situation ; that they 're much more cautious , much more reluctant reformers than some of the reformist groups in the government , " @entity33 said			1
according to @entity16 , @entity7 graduated from the @entity84 in 1971 before rising through the ranks to become commander of the @entity87 11 , responsible for security in @entity9 , also known as @entity89			2
he later served in the @entity90 before returning to @entity9 as head of the @entity92 where he was thought to have participated in the violent crackdown on protesters during the 2007 " @entity95			0
" as least a dozen people were killed , several dozens wounded and more than 2,000 arrested , according to a @entity99 report , which added that the toll could be much higher			0
" ( @entity7 ) was responsible for security affairs in @entity89 , @entity9 and when the shooting took place the order probably came from the top and he had to take care of all the things on the ground , meaning the troops and killing and detaining , " @entity14 said			0
however , @entity33 said @entity7 was also considered someone who " gets along , " that is , someone who can navigate a path between military loyalists and people within the government more receptive to change			2
" in that context he 's not altogether that different from the current president @entity40 who of course is also someone who seems to be able to get along with both the previous regime and some of the reformers , " he said			1
@entity33 described former vice president @entity62 as a " very rough character with rough edges who aggravated a lot of people , particularly in the reformist camp			2
" " i think ( @entity127 ) wo n't be as overtly oppositional to reform			0
i think the remaining question is to what extent will he support it ? "			0
