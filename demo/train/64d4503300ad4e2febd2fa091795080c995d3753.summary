-- @entity2 's purchase of hot blogging platform @entity3 , which it announced monday , was big news for the hundreds of millions of folks who already post to the site or check in to follow those who do			1
but the $ 1.1 billion buyout will also no doubt introduce @entity3 to lots of folks not yet wholly familiar with it , even if their web searches for viral memes and cute kittens have already landed them there unawares			1
so , here are some facts you need to know about @entity3 ( which , in the grand tradition of web startups everywhere , shed its " e " early on )			2
it 's big and getting bigger founded in 2007 , @entity3 has stayed hot on a @entity23 that can be unforgiving once it decides you 're yesterday 's news			1
while its numbers are n't comparable to social - networking giants like @entity28 , they 're certainly enough to put hundreds of millions more eyeballs on the ads @entity2 serves up as its bread and butter			2
let 's face it -- when the @entity35 signs up for an account , you know you 're onto something			0
to wit ( according to the company ) : number of @entity3 blogs : 105 million monthly visitors : 300 million posts per second : 900 new signups every day : 120,000 it loves an animated @entity46 if there was a ground zero for the rebirth of the @entity23 's beloved video loops , it was @entity3			1
once relegated to the scrap heap of web culture ( we miss you , @entity57 ) , the past couple of years have reminded us of an enduring truth : it 's fun to watch a cute duck , a bouncy olympian or " bros " watching basketball over and over and over again			0
@entity3 's quick , visual - friendly publishing platform is perfect for @entity65			1
nobody expects a 10,000 - word essay			0
make us laugh and all is well			0
oh , and how did @entity2 ceo @entity70 choose to make the big announcement ? on her own @entity3			1
they 've figured out mobile our society is becoming a mobile one and increasingly , phones and tablets are the preferred portals for people to access the @entity23			0
for example , more people now access @entity28 via mobile than on the traditional web ( a fact the site has had to aggressively address to stay relevant and make stockholders happy )			2
5 questions answered about @entity89 but while some desktop titans are having to adjust , @entity3 is already living comfortably in that mobile world			0
more than half of @entity3 's 300 million users access it with its mobile app , and that crowd does so an average of seven times a day			1
there 's kind of a lot of porn shocker -- there 's porn on the @entity105			2
but while most any corner of the @entity23 that allows user posts is bound to have its share of naughty bits , @entity3 has become a go - to spot for adult - entertainment industry types and amateur smut - lovers alike			0
( the company , of course , does n't say what percentage of its site is adult content , but a recent analysis puts it at over 11 percent			0
) and the site does n't really shy away from that fact , acknowledging as much in its community guidelines			0
" @entity3 is home to millions of readers and bloggers from a variety of locations , cultures , and backgrounds with different points of view concerning adult - oriented content , " the entry reads , asking users only to make sure to identify such pages as @entity124 ( " not safe for work " ) and , of course , not to post anything illegal			2
that 's all well and good for an edgy startup , but could be an issue that needs to be tackled as @entity2 aims to appeal to as many advertisers as possible			1
in the meantime , just make sure you look for those four letters when searching the site			0
it 's cool for a few years , nobody 's really been sure what @entity2 is , other than a place where an aging user base gets its e-mail and looks at a few news stories			1
@entity3 is @entity154 's bid to get young and hip -- and it 's not a bad bet			1
from " @entity158 " to " @entity159 , " the most buzzed - about blogs of the past few years have tended to originate at @entity3			2
whether its " @entity162 looking at @entity163 " or " @entity165 , " fun and a little bit edgy is n't hard to find on the site .			0
