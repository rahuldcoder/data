-- " it 's like all our memories are gone			1
" that 's what my brother said when he called to talk about the devastation @entity9 wreaked on the @entity10 , the summer playground of our youth			1
with those words i realized that as concerned and sad as i was about the effect of the storm , i was also mourning for a place that harbored so many happy memories for me growing up that may never be the same			1
my brother still lives in the @entity20 , but i have long since moved to @entity21 and married a woman from @entity23 , @entity24			0
for vacations , we venture out to exotic spots			0
but the word " vacation " always conjures up images of the @entity10 in my mind , and i have often found it difficult to communicate to my wife and my @entity35 friends what an important cultural touchstone the @entity10 is for people in that region			1
all they know is the caricatured version presented by @entity42			1
but for tens of millions of people in greater @entity43 and @entity44 who live a short drive or train ride away , the @entity10 has always been a weekend destination where families vacation year after year			1
@entity43 after @entity9 : a tale of two cities it was not a coastline of resorts and golf courses , like so much of the @entity55			1
it was grid - based towns that went right up to the beach and were capped off with boardwalks that stretched for miles			2
back home in @entity63 , we all knew those towns			0
we knew which had the best piers with the best rides , and we knew that the best sausage and pepper sandwich was at a boardwalk stand in @entity70			0
we knew that @entity72 the @entity71 was actually a hotel in @entity74 and that the places on the @entity77 board really existed			0
we also knew that " the @entity78 " meant only the @entity10			1
everywhere else was just the beach			2
but the shore was more than just a beach			1
it was carnival rides and boardwalks and the remnants of what entertainment looked like in the @entity88 era			0
it was the birthplace of @entity90 and the land of @entity92			0
it was beach towns filled with memories made by generations of families			1
my grandparents were the first ones in my family who were born in @entity103 , and for them and every generation in my family , our first encounter with the ocean was at the @entity10			1
as a result , i was able to do some of the same things in the same places my grandmother did , when as a young woman she would take the train from @entity44 to @entity115 with her girlfriends to frolic in the sand and walk the boardwalk			0
i could hang out on the beach and wander around the sights in @entity121 , just like my mom did			2
it is a connection that binds generations			1
it was to the @entity10 that my brother and our high school friends went the day after senior proms , just like our dad did			2
and we both agree our best family vacation ever was in @entity131 in 1977 , when he was 12 and i was 10			2
so many of our friends were there at the same time , and we could finally hang out on the boardwalk on our own			0
i loved it so much i vowed i would keep forever a t - shirt i got at a boat race we attended that week			0
it is now my 9 - year - old son 's favorite t - shirt and his special connection to the @entity10			1
entertainment : ' @entity10 ' cast on @entity9 devastation when you are married to someone who grew up on an island with palm trees , it is hard to convince them the @entity10 is a worthy alternative			1
but i finally convinced my wife to go there for a family reunion when she was newly pregnant with our first child			0
we arrived when it was dark , and the cool , late summer air was damp with the ocean spray			0
i insisted that she walk up to the beach with me , and when we got there we turned , looked north and i showed her the boardwalk pier stretching out over the water , with a @entity168 and a roller coaster lighting up the night sky over the black ocean			2
i stood behind her , with my arms wrapped around her shoulders , and sang in a whisper into her ear : " the amusement park rises bold and stark ; kids are huddled on the beach in the mist			2
" i could finally show her that place was real			0
and that imagery was the imagery of my memories			0
and my parents ' memories			0
and their parents ' memories			0
and that was my @entity10			2
share your memories of the @entity10 with @entity3 's @entity194			1
what are your memories ? what photos of the @entity78 are important to you ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity200 .			1

@entity200 : @entity10 , *wrecked* by @entity9 , may never be the same
**vigilante** : the place harbors so many happy memories for me growing up
he says *unlike* the @entity42 caricature , it has been a vacation spot for many
**vigilante** : the shore is more than a beach ; it 's a connection that binds generations
