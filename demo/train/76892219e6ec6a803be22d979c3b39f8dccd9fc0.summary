-- ask a small farmer in @entity2 about the impact of the global financial crisis on his daily life and he will answer , " crisis ? what crisis ? " as farmers , we know what a big crisis is			1
in 1997 , we saw the collapse of the whole economy , driving thousands of unemployed construction and industry workers back to the villages , where their families already had difficulties making ends meet			1
but the current situation is different and raises some worrying alarm bells			2
although national industry keeps hiring workers and new infrastructure projects continue to pop up , our daily life has worsened on several fronts			1
the most noticeable change is the increased pressure on agricultural land			2
thousands of small farmers have been evicted from the fields they have cultivated for generations , because local or national authorities are giving concessions to large companies to exploit the land			2
many @entity2 farmers do not have any clear land titles , as it is estimated that only 40 % of ownership can be proven by formal certificates			1
moreover , some territories on the national mapping appear as " empty " , even if they have been inhabited for generations			0
in principle , most of the farmers ' communities are covered by customary laws that are also recognized by the state			2
however , land deals are extremely profitable both for the authorities and for the companies who negotiate them			0
the lack of respect for people 's rights to land makes it extremely easy for companies to brutally evict farmers			1
they are replaced by large plantations , including palm oil and rubber plantations , food estates , mines , roads and other infrastructure projects			0
this results in increasingly violent land conflicts as local communities resist eviction			0
the @entity75 ( @entity76 ) calculated that the number of land conflicts increased five-fold , from 22 in 2010 to 120 in 2011			0
a case involving the alleged killing of nine farmers in @entity83 and @entity84 is now being investigated by the @entity2 @entity85			1
similar human rights violations are taking place on a daily basis in the archipelago			0
in 2011 alone , the farmer 's union counted 20 deaths due to land conflicts in @entity2			1
the government routinely prioritizes large - scale , export - oriented production over the needs of local growers and consumers			0
the financial crisis has accelerated this dramatic land grab as farmland is now seen by the finance industry as a considerable source of returns			2
@entity2 's fast rate of deforestation instead of protecting local farmers from massive evictions , the @entity2 government is further opening the doors to foreign investors			1
in the framework of the @entity113 that took place in 2011 in @entity115 , the chairman of the @entity2 chamber of commerce @entity117 announced that 14 transnational companies including @entity120 , @entity121 , @entity122 , @entity123 and @entity124 , had signed a partnership agreement with the government to increase food productivity in @entity2			1
we are facing other problems			0
uncertainty about commodity prices has increased tremendously since 2007			0
whether we are producing for export or for the local market , prices have become unpredictable			0
prices of inputs -- such as seeds , fertilizers and energy -- have become very volatile , making it impossible for us to assess our production costs			0
for farmers , price instability and volatility are worse than simply low prices : it makes it virtually impossible to plan what to grow in the coming season , what products we can buy , and so forth			2
there are a number of causes of this volatility , including a lack of food reserves and the arrival of global financial speculators in agricultural markets following the sub-prime crisis			2
we are also dealing with a surge of cheap imported products into the domestic market			1
in village markets on @entity164 , we now see potatoes and chillies imported from @entity167 at a very low price			0
the minimum production cost of potatoes in those villages is 7,000 rupiah a kilo , but @entity167 potatoes are sold at 2,500 rupiah			0
this discourages farmers from producing , ultimately raising unemployment , encouraging more people to migrate away from rural areas and putting pressure elsewhere in the system , especially in our already stressed urban areas			2
for these reasons , we feel that even though farmers constitute almost half the @entity2 workforce , our economic sector is the most neglected in the country			1
we have the capacity and natural resources to feed the whole country yet we are deprived of our land , and our government has failed to pursue agricultural policies to enable us to continue our vital role			0
according to the @entity2 government 's own figures , 2.16 million farmers had to leave farming in 2011 due to a lack of land and incentives			1
in our @entity2 villages , we do n't currently talk about any particular " world crisis			1
" we talk about the continuing daily struggle to make a living in extremely harsh conditions			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity208			0

in 1997 @entity2 farmers witnessed the collapse of the whole economy
but the current " crisis " is worrying and a farmer 's daily life is getting worse
farmers face issues including pressure on land and cheap imported goods
@entity225 farmers do n't talk of " crisis , " but of life 's continuing daily struggle
