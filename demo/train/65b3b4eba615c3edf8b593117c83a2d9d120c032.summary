@entity0 , @entity1 -- the grease - covered orange overalls ca n't hide 14 - year - old @entity6 's frail frame			1
as he leans under the hood of a wrecked car , torn plastic sandals on his feet , i know i can not possibly understand the life this young boy is forced to lead in war - torn @entity1 -- where jobs are few , pay is appalling , and young children must work rather than go to school and play with their friends			1
@entity6 is one of the boy mechanics of the @entity23 yard in western @entity0			1
@entity2 producer @entity24 has brought me here			0
as an @entity1 , @entity24 sees a side of life here that the @entity28 generals and politicians never see			2
there are dozens of young boys here -- thin and frail because of a lack of nutrition brought on by staggering poverty			2
they are typically brought to the muddy yard by a male relative			0
dozens of ramshackle huts , lean - tos and tiny one - room buildings house auto mechanics and repair shops where cars , buses and trucks are brought by local @entity1 to be fixed			1
there is no safety gear			1
welding sparks hit one young boy 's eye as @entity6 carries large pieces of metal across the yard			1
another young boy struggles under the weight of large pails of supplies he is carrying			0
@entity6 agrees to sit for a few minutes to talk to me , with @entity59			2
i quickly learn he works ten hours a day , six days a week			1
the boss pays him less than a dollar a day			2
and his wages are the only income for his family of five			2
his father was blinded years ago in a @entity68 rocket attack and can not work			0
his mother has two other small children at home			0
@entity6 has had three years of school			1
then , last year , his uncle brought him here			0
it takes @entity6 one hour to walk from his one - room home to the yard			1
he arrives at 7 a.m. and begins to work			0
he and the boys get a morning and noon meal			0
at the end of his ten - hour day , this small boy walks home again , often in the very lonely dark			1
when i ask if he ever plays with friends , i get a heartbreaking answer of one word : " no. " in @entity6 's world there is no time for play			1
he tells me he just works and there is " no time for fun			1
" he tells me he is happy to have the job and be able to help his family			0
but these boy mechanics of @entity0 do have dreams of another life for themselves -- and , remarkably , for their country			1
@entity6 tells me he would like to go back to school and become a teacher			1
he says he feels it 's a way he can " serve " his country			2
throughout our chat , @entity6 never smiles			2
across the yard we meet 12 - year - old @entity109 inside one of the dark shops , bent over his cooking pots			1
his father brings him here to cook for the workers and then he can go to school			0
@entity109 says he does n't want to be a mechanic			0
