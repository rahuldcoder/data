-- in politics , as in life , big things often come in small packages			0
@entity5 stands 4 feet 11 , but the veteran community activist is casting a long shadow over the political landscape in @entity9			1
@entity10 is poised to win election next month as the first @entity12 on the @entity13 to represent @entity9 's @entity14 , one of the largest concentrations of @entity12 outside of mainland @entity18			1
she ousted a two - term incumbent in september 's @entity22 primary and will be on the ballot november 3 in a district that overwhelmingly favors @entity22			2
if elected , she also will be the first @entity26 - @entity25 woman to join the 51 - member body responsible for governing the country 's largest and most diverse urban area			1
her likely win is another milestone in the political rise of a rapidly growing @entity26 - @entity25 community			1
for @entity10 , a 56 - year - old @entity37 immigrant , the long road to political victory has not been easy			1
as she closes in on a probable november victory , though , she 's confident the lessons learned along the way will serve her -- and her constituents -- well			2
@entity10 's @entity25 story began almost a half century ago , during the @entity45 administration			1
her father , seeking new opportunities , left @entity18 for @entity48			0
a few months later , he became an undocumented @entity25 worker , scratching out a living as a waiter in the @entity53 section of @entity9			2
when the family 's immigration papers came through in 1963 , he borrowed money to bring them to @entity25			1
@entity5 , the third of five children , remembers her dad 's exhaustion and pain after spending long days on his feet			1
she also remembers the skills he perfected preparing the restaurant 's dim sum , a traditional @entity12 morning meal			0
" he made the best shrimp dumplings , " she recalled in a recent @entity0 interview			0
" he had the technique down pat on how to make the skin so thin			0
" @entity10 's father died a long time ago , but his decision to pursue the @entity77 -- starting as an undocumented immigrant -- left a lasting impression on his only daughter			1
today , immigration reform is one of her passions			0
" people are here because of the opportunities @entity25 has to offer , " she said			2
we need to fix our immigration system so more people can help build the country			0
" @entity10 is campaigning on a range of traditional lunch - bucket issues -- affordable housing , job creation , and better care for senior citizens			1
repairing the city 's aging infrastructure is also a priority in a sprawling @entity104 district that encompasses @entity14 as well as @entity105 , @entity106 , the @entity107 , @entity108 , and @entity109			1
more than four in 10 people in the district are @entity12 - @entity25 , according to campaign spokesman @entity112			1
the bulk of those residents -- including @entity10 's mother , a retired garment worker -- live in rapidly gentrifying @entity14			1
they and other asian - americans make up the fastest - growing minority group in @entity9			2
" this @entity13 district was drawn in the early 1990s in part to enable @entity14 residents to elect a candidate of choice , " noted @entity119 , head of @entity9 's @entity120			1
" eighteen years later , an @entity26 has finally been chosen			2
it 's a significant step forward for @entity26 - @entity25 political representation			1
" @entity10 is one of three @entity26 now positioned to win seats on the @entity13 , @entity128 noted			1
@entity130 , the @entity22 nominee for comptroller , is poised to become the first @entity26 to win a citywide office			1
in the past decade , the total nationwide population of @entity134 and @entity135 jumped to almost 13 million , a nearly 50 percent increase since 1990 , according to the @entity137			0
while asian - americans make up roughly 4 percent of the nation 's population , they have been slow to win office on the national or state level			1
they currently hold only 1 percent of the seats in @entity145 , the @entity137 notes			0
in politically powerful @entity146 , according to the @entity137 , @entity26 and @entity135 account for well over 10 percent of the population , but hold less than 8 percent of the seats in the state legislature			2
@entity10 draws a parallel between the transformation of @entity9 's @entity14 , home to a growing number of young professionals and a vibrant commercial hub , and the gradual political maturation of the @entity12 - @entity25 community			1
one of the reasons @entity14 has not yet had a @entity12 - @entity25 representative in @entity161 , she believes , is because the community did not know how to mobilize effectively			1
" a lot of @entity12 simply did not understand how the political process works , " she said			1
" @entity9 is a largely @entity22 city , but they did n't know that many elections are basically decided in the @entity22 primary			0
so they did n't register as a member of either political party			0
" @entity10 helped lead the fight for local election ballots printed in @entity12 in the early 1990s			2
" there 's often not an accurate @entity12 translation for @entity177 names , and vice-versa , " she noted			0
" too many people could n't understand the ballots			0
other people who got the registration process right were still turned away at the polls because election workers could n't understand their names			2
" @entity10 has run three losing @entity22 primary campaigns for the @entity13 -- in 1991 , 1993 , and 2001			2
the current campaign is different , she said , partly because of greater mobilization among @entity12 and partly because of her own political education			2
this time , @entity10 launched her campaign two years before the primary			1
she left her job with the advocacy group @entity194 so she could run full time			1
" i have to credit my husband , @entity196 , for that , " she said with a laugh			0
" he told me , ' if you want to do it , focus			0
quit your job and do it			2
' it 's great to have family support			0
" her son @entity207 , studying photography in @entity206 , @entity146 , provides moral support from afar			0
@entity10 also stepped up fundraising operations , raising and spending the legal limit of $ 161,000 in the primary			2
her campaign headquarters , located in the ground floor of a @entity216 high rise , is humming most days with five to 10 volunteers			0
the campaign has one paid staffer			0
more than 400 people have volunteered to answer phones , stuff envelopes , and knock on doors -- the unglamorous nuts - and - blots work of many campaigns			0
one factor working in @entity10 's favor is voter backlash against a recent decision to repeal a two - term limit for @entity13 members and the mayor			1
the city council member @entity10 defeated in the primary , @entity235 , was one of several incumbents ousted largely as a result of that issue			2
mayor @entity240 also backed the repeal , and is now seeking a third term			0
" eight years is enough , " she argued			0
" you can do a lot of good in that time			0
i wo n't serve more than two terms			0
" @entity247 may be popular , but the billionaire businessman 's agenda does n't always sit well with @entity10 , who remains in many ways a @entity252 - style @entity251			1
" he needs to be a mayor for everyone			0
i think he 's favoring the more well - to - do , " she said			2
" @entity9 's working families have lots of needs , and he has n't always been there for them			0
" @entity10 's likely election as the first @entity12 to represent @entity14 comes amid other historic political developments			1
gov. @entity262 is @entity9 's first @entity263 - @entity25 governor as well as the first legally blind governor in the @entity25			1
and president @entity266 , of course , is the nation 's first @entity263 - @entity25 president			1
so could there be an @entity26 - @entity25 president one day ? " sure , " @entity10 said , " but i 'd really like to see a woman president			1
" could she be that woman ? absolutely not , she replied with a chuckle			0
" @entity274 is enough , " she said			0
" it took me a long time to get to this point			0
and soon it will be time to give someone else a chance			0

@entity5 's likely win is a milestone for growing @entity26 - @entity25 community
@entity14 's community has taken *awhile* to understand the political process , @entity10 says
this is @entity10 's fourth attempt to win election ; this time she quit her job to campaign full time
