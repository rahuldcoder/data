@entity0 is debating legislation that will limit @entity2 ' right to keep and bear arms and infringe on the right to privacy			0
the @entity6 was made part of our @entity8 explicitly to protect freedoms : the freedom of speech , protection against searches without a warrant , the right to trial by jury and the right to protect oneself with a firearm			0
i am compelled to stand up for every amendment and right enumerated in the @entity8			1
senate majority leader @entity23 is attempting to push forward with gun control legislation			2
the chief problem i have is that nothing in this legislation would have prevented the terrible massacre in @entity29 , @entity30			1
i am open to ideas that would help prevent tragedies , but this legislation would not have saved us from the national heartbreak of the december school shooting			1
i oppose legislation that undermines @entity2 ' constitutional right to bear arms			2
i worry that legislation mandating more regulations on law - abiding citizens will lead to an infringement on the ability to exercise constitutional rights without being subject to government surveillance			1
i also worry that these efforts will merely disarm the people who follow the law and empower those who ignore it			1
along with sens. @entity52 of @entity53 and @entity54 of @entity55 , i circulated a letter promising to " oppose any legislation that would infringe on the @entity2 people 's constitutional right to bear arms , or on their ability to exercise this right without being subjected to government surveillance			1
" we have been joined by sens. @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 and @entity74			0
but more senators need to stand up for our @entity77 rights or the rights will be lost			1
both the left - leaning @entity79 and the right - leaning @entity80 have raised privacy concerns about the legislation pending before @entity0			2
@entity83 of the @entity79 was quoted recently saying that he worries about submitted gun control legislation that may lead to the " creation of government databases and collections of personal information on all of us			1
" @entity90 of the @entity80 worries that " loose language " in the submitted legislation may lead to the government keeping " centralized records of who received what guns and where			1
" these are privacy concerns that i share			0
potentially on the table are new laws that would outlaw firearms and magazines that hold more than 10 rounds as well as require universal background checks , which effectively restrict the right of law - abiding citizens to buy guns at gun shows and give or sell them to friends and family without having to get the government 's permission			1
one version of the legislation pending before the @entity116 goes so far as to empower the attorney general to tax gun transactions and creates a new felony crime for knowingly failing to report for more than 24 hours that a gun has been lost or stolen			1
legislation being pushed by sen. @entity122 of @entity123 arbitrarily bans certain weapons			0
president @entity125 has conceded that this idea may not pass during a comprehensive gun debate , yet i worry that the idea may come up again once @entity0 passes the first round of gun control			2
@entity2 exercise their right every day to protect themselves and their families			0
recently , a 14 - year - old @entity134 boy shot an armed intruder who broke into his home while he was baby - sitting his three younger siblings			2
the children were home alone on a saturday afternoon when an unrecognized woman rang their doorbell			0
after the teenager refused to open the door , he heard someone trying to break into the house			0
the boy hurried his younger siblings upstairs and collected a handgun from his parents ' room			0
when the boy rounded the top of the stairs , a man was standing in the doorway with a gun pointed at him			2
the boy shot the intruder and possibly saved the lives of his three siblings			0
it is terrible that a young boy had to go through this experience , but it is just one example among many of armed citizens protecting themselves and the public from very bad people			0
i stood up for the @entity173 and fifth amendments during a filibuster a few weeks ago to address the president 's constitutional authority to use drones against @entity2 citizens and the limits of executive power			0
now i am prepared to protect the @entity77 " right of the people to keep and bear arms			1
" i stand ready to stand up for the @entity184 right to a trial by jury , as i will stand up for any other infringement of our @entity6			0
our rights are not subjected to polls			0
whether it is popular or not popular , i took an oath to the @entity8 , and i am prepared to stand with other senators or alone to protect the freedoms that our @entity195 fought to preserve .			1

@entity198 says he *vowed* to uphold all constitutional rights , *including* gun *ownership*
@entity198 : nothing in *proposed* gun laws would prevent tragedies such as the @entity29 massacre
@entity198 : more regulations could lead to government surveillance , disarm law - abiding people
more senators need to stand up for the @entity77 or rights will be lost , he says
