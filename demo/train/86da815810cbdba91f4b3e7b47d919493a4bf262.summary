-- check out these 10 scenic spots to swim , float and soak in the sun at the @entity4 's amazing national parks			1
best for adventure : @entity6 , @entity7 okay , here 's the catch			1
there 's just one way to reach most @entity13 beaches in the canyon -- and that 's by rafting down the river			1
only then do you experience secluded beaches like @entity19 and @entity20			1
many people , of course , consider the 3 - to 18 - day trips one of the high points of their lives			2
as for the beach experience , the water is n't warm -- figure anywhere from 48 ° to 60 ° -- but given that @entity6 summer temps can rise to above 100 ° , it feels , says veteran outfitter @entity32 , " just great			1
" do n't miss : well , the river rafting			2
trips are often booked up far in advance , but in this recessionary year , you should be able to slip into one now through the end of the season in midfall			2
get there : all - inclusive river trips from $ 1,100 for four days ; nps.gov / grca for a list of park - approved outfitters			2
-- @entity44 @entity0 's guide to the @entity6 best lazy float : @entity47 , @entity48 with @entity52 and @entity53 towering above , the @entity50 beaches in @entity51 sometimes get forgotten			1
which is a mistake , especially in summer , when valley temps sizzle and the river water is blissfully cool			1
the two main beaches , @entity58 and @entity59 , are great for splashing or bobbing around in an inner tube			1
do n't miss : taking on the @entity50 by raft			1
rent a four - to six - person raft at @entity63 , and float 3 miles to @entity64 ; the $ 26 fee includes shuttle service back to your start			2
get there : in summer , take the @entity52 shuttle to stop @entity71 and walk 1/4 mile to @entity72 , or get off at @entity73 , 1/2 mile from @entity74 ; $ 20 per vehicle ; nps.gov / yose or 209/372 - 8319 ( raft rental )			1
-- @entity44 sunset : 36 fun fall escapes best beachcombing : @entity80 , @entity81 the easy 3 - mile ( one - way ) hike to @entity84 , near @entity85 , is best made at low tide , when you encounter some of the best tidepools on @entity89			1
against the backdrop of towering sea stacks , @entity93 waves , and the occasional kayaker , peer down at neon pink and chartreuse sea anemones and bright orange seastars			2
do n't miss : point of the @entity102 , a mind - bending array of sea stacks 1.3 miles down the beach			2
get there : @entity85 , about 160 miles northwest of @entity105 , is on the @entity106 ; ask for a map when you buy your @entity109 ( $ 10 ) ; nps.gov / olym or 360/645 - 2711 ( reservation info )			2
-- @entity111 best desert oasis : @entity113 , @entity114 / @entity7 a blue mirage set in red rocks , @entity117 -- which forms the watery heart of @entity113 -- has nearly 2,000 miles of shoreline , which means a lot of @entity117 beaches to choose from			1
a few , like @entity123 , can be reached by car			2
but some of the best are nameless coves accessed only by boat			2
good thing you can rent powerboats at three lake marinas : @entity132 , @entity133 , and @entity134			2
( houseboats are also popular , but you ca n't navigate into narrow coves as well			2
) do n't miss : a cruise to the lake 's south shore and @entity141 , home to the world 's largest known natural rock bridge			1
get there : $ 15 per vehicle ; nps.gov / glca or @entity147 ( boat rental )			0
-- @entity44 sunset : 10 great dog - friendly getaways best for surf and sun : @entity153 , @entity48 malibu - ites know to skip the @entity156 tourist zoo and come to @entity157			0
officially one of three beaches that make up @entity161 -- likely to provoke a " huh ? " even from locals -- it 's a gem tucked from sight at the foot of sandstone cliffs ( and accessed by a dirt trail and stairway )			1
out in the waves , bodyboarders and surfers perform aerial acrobatics			0
on shore , scenically carved sea caves make @entity157 a favorite with photographers , often seen snapping away at leggy models			0

they zip out along sir @entity196 to crashing @entity198 or to @entity199 , where there 's a proper visitor center and cafe			1
few think to turn off instead at @entity203 , which dead - ends in deserted grassy dunes			0
all the better for you			0
climb up and over , and you 'll see a narrow finger of sand stretching 2 miles north between @entity209 and a mighty estuary teeming with birds			0
out at the tip , harbor seals loll and bark			0
on the rare sunny summer day , the water is calm and swimmable			1
do n't miss : a walk with your pooch , welcome on - leash at the section south of the parking lot			0
get there : from the @entity224 , head north about 1/4 mile to @entity225 , turn left and follow it 1 1/4 miles to @entity227 , then turn left again and go 7 1/2 miles to the parking lot at @entity229 ; nps.gov / pore or 415/464 - 5100			0
-- @entity230 sunset : 10 places for your life list best for thinking really , really big : @entity235 , @entity48 to step from a redwood forest onto the wide - to - the - sky spread of @entity238 is an unforgettable memory			0

-- @entity189 best ocean - view swimming hole : @entity268 , @entity269 , @entity270 @entity270 's national parks feature volcanoes , not beaches			1
and yet @entity269 's @entity268 includes a " beach " of a sort -- not sand but large , warm basaltic stones ; not ocean but the refreshing roar of plunging freshwater cascades			1
@entity281 ( popularly misnamed @entity282 ) lies beyond @entity283 in the verdant @entity285 district			0
the lower pools , right off the roadside parking lot , are superb " swimming holes , " but they crowd up by midday ; get there before 10			1
