planes , trains and automobiles -- all these modes of transportation were affected saturday by @entity5 , even with the storm many hours away from making landfall			2
the storm is expected to cause massive flooding and widespread power outages when it hits the @entity10 , in full , late sunday and into next week			1
but before that happens , transportation companies and government officials are allowing -- and , in some cases , urging -- people to plan for the worst			2
a number of airlines , for example , are allowing customers to change their flight plans without paying any fees due to @entity5			1
@entity22 will let those ticketed to fly between sunday and wednesday , in and out of airports in 15 states and the @entity26 , to reschedule by november 4			2
@entity28 's offer applies to travel to - and - from 29 airports , for the same dates			0
@entity10 braces for ' superstorm ' other airlines , such as @entity33 , are offering a similar process , with slight variations			1
and at least in @entity38 ' case , the weather is already keeping airlines busy : the airline apologized to customers on its @entity43 feed for long waits to get through to agents due to a high call volume tied to @entity5			2
@entity47 announced saturday that it will cancel some of its train runs on sunday to and from @entity49 and @entity50 , @entity51 ; @entity52 and @entity26 ; @entity53 and @entity54 ; and @entity26 and @entity54			1
in addition , a train scheduled to run monday between @entity26 and @entity52 will also remain in the station			0
" passengers are encouraged to travel on earlier available trains on sunday , " @entity47 said in a news release			1
" additional cancellations might be necessary in the coming days as this major storm moves north			0
" even @entity54 's vaunted , round - the - clock subway system could shut down due to flooding and other issues tied to the storm			1
officials say they 'll decide sunday whether to suspend service on the subway , as well as on buses and commuter rail , depending on @entity5 proceeds			1
for now , @entity54 should plan their lives as if such a suspension will happen , gov. @entity72 said			2
" @entity54 need to take action now to protect themselves , and as the transportation system prepares to possibly suspend service , no one should wait until the last minute to prepare , " said @entity72 , who has declared a state of emergency in the state			1
meanwhile , @entity82 is taking steps to shut down @entity85 bus , rail and @entity87 on monday -- much as it did last year for 36 hours due to @entity88			0
" by beginning this important process , @entity85 will be better able to support the state 's response to @entity5 by freeing up buses or other resources that may be needed for hurricane relief , " @entity90 commissioner @entity89 said in a press release			0
for all the potential headaches at airports , train stations and bus terminals , the type of transportation affected first and most directly by @entity5 may be boating			0
all along the @entity10 , meteorologists and officials have warned people to steer clear of the seas because of potentially perilous high winds and large waves tied to the storm			1
@entity111 and @entity112 , a @entity113 couple , were surprised -- given how late it is in the hurricane season -- that @entity5 has delayed their plans to sail from @entity118 to the @entity119			0
but they know that this is n't the first time that @entity123 has affected travel plans -- nor will it be the last			0
" we 've got a surprise , so we 'll just ride it out , " @entity126 said			0
" there 's not much else we can do			0
