@entity0 -- @entity3 's military intervention in @entity4 has surprised many who believed @entity3 foreign policy was committed to disengagement from international conflicts			1
the country 's refusal to commit forces to the war on @entity12 in 2003 was interpreted in the @entity13 -- not only in government but in the @entity13 media and public opinion -- as the consequence of a pacifist doctrine and even as a scandalous betrayal of its allies			1
more recently the withdrawal of @entity3 troops from @entity24 could have reinforced the impression that @entity3 was pulling out of international military commitments			2
the notion that @entity3 is withdrawing from international military engagements fails to grasp the realities of @entity3 foreign policy			1
@entity3 remains amongst the @entity31 countries most likely to make a direct military intervention in a foreign country			1
it is not only consistent with @entity3 foreign policy doctrine -- @entity3 is also one of the few major global powers with the capacity to do so			1
it nonetheless legitimates questions about the consistency of @entity3 foreign policy			1
the socialist government just sent troops into @entity4 to combat @entity44 extremists only days after president @entity45 refused to intervene in @entity46 after its government was asked for military assistance			2
president @entity45 's predecessor @entity49 ordered a military intervention in @entity52 against @entity53 after refusing to engage his troops in the @entity55 during the initial phase of the crisis in that west @entity59 country			2
@entity60 : @entity13 could provide logistical , intel support in @entity4 so where is the logic in @entity3 foreign policy ? to answer this question , it is necessary to grasp that @entity3 foreign policy attempts to balance two sometimes conflicting goals -- objective and subjective			1
the first corresponds to @entity3 commitment to work with international institutions to maintain a global order that is multi-polar and regulated by law			2
the second refers to @entity3 's goal of protecting and enhancing its own national interests			1
let 's first take the " objectivity " paradigm			0
@entity3 has consistently emphasized the pre-eminent role of the @entity79 in conflict resolution			2
as a permanent member of the @entity83 , @entity3 policy is based on the belief that international military interventions must seek the legitimacy of the @entity79			1
this does not mean smug @entity3 pacifism			2
on the contrary , membership on the security council imposes special obligations			0
@entity3 is willing to back a @entity79 commitment to muscular military interventionism			2
@entity3 is actively involved in various @entity79 - supervised military missions			0
@entity3 advocates that emerging countries be accepted as members of the @entity83 if those countries show a commitment and capacity to take on the responsibility of @entity79 - sanctioned military interventions			0
to cite one example , @entity3 has urged @entity104 to take action in the @entity107 crisis under the @entity79 aegis			0
@entity3 considers itself an " agent " of the @entity79 where necessary , but often works behind the scenes to influence @entity79 decisions			0
this occurred with @entity52 , following @entity53 's offensive on @entity113			0
to do so , @entity3 imposed an expansive interpretation of the @entity115 [ that imposed a no - fly zone over @entity52 ]			0
its position highlighted a conception of international law and sovereignty opposed to that of @entity122 and @entity123			0
the @entity3 position was even bolder than that of the @entity13 and @entity126			0
indeed , one could argue that @entity3 was more aggressive than its allies about legally sanctioned military intervention in foreign countries			1
@entity3 's status as the philosophical cradle of human rights also impacts its foreign policy			1
recent @entity3 military interventions have invoked the need to protect civilians against their own government and to prevent crimes against humanity			0
we witnessed this in the case of @entity52 , but also in the mid- 1990s when @entity3 intervened in @entity143 and @entity144			0
in both cases , @entity3 intellectuals were exercising pressure in favor of intervention on behalf of human rights			1
these pressures can have a substantial impact in a country like @entity3 where intellectual elites work through petitions or direct influence on the government citing the special status of @entity3 in the world			0
they are less effective , of course , when there are obstacles within the @entity83 , as in the case in the @entity165 crisis			0
what 's behind instability in @entity4 ? @entity168 has reaffirmed @entity3 's commitment to have a special role in defense of human rights			1
at the same time , @entity3 's " subjective " interests can not be overlooked -- especially when the @entity3 " post-colonial paradox " comes into play			1
like @entity126 , @entity3 has stronger ties , and when necessary a greater military presence , in former colonies from @entity179 to @entity180			2
@entity3 colonial history explains why the government of @entity4 has called on @entity3 for military assistance to combat @entity44 terrorism			1
at the same time , @entity3 governments are reluctant to intervene in these countries precisely because @entity3 wishes to avoid looking like a colonial master			0
it was easier for @entity49 to take a quick decision regarding @entity52 than on the @entity55 for this reason			0
@entity52 is not a former @entity3 colony			0
in like manner , @entity168 's refusal to directly involve the @entity3 army against the rebels held in @entity46 is partly based on a desire to avoid the accusation of @entity3 colonial meddling in the internal affairs of a former colony			1
furthermore , @entity3 has to take into account the importance of migrants related to its former colonies			1
the intervention in the former @entity206 was also a message for the @entity209 community that @entity3 interventionism was not inspired by the crusade spirit			2
and one could say the same for the @entity3 positions in @entity52 , @entity55 or @entity165 crisis			0
this time , in @entity4 , it must be acknowledged that the @entity3 intervention was desired by most of the @entity4 who live in @entity3			1
the @entity3 counter-offensive has been in the works for many months			0
@entity3 feared , above all , the prospect of direct intervention			2
that 's why @entity3 was urging @entity59 countries to set up their own forces to support @entity4			1
direct @entity3 military action became urgent however when the @entity44 insurgents threatened to invade the country 's southern region			2
@entity226 suddenly took priority over law			0
in conclusion , @entity3 intervenes in foreign countries according both to doctrine and to the pragmatic parameters of circumstance			1
@entity3 foreign policy is based on balancing these sometimes conflicting goals of objectivity and subjectivity			1
in international relations , the hard reality is that actions are often commanded by facts			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity244			0

@entity3 's refusal to commit forces to @entity12 in 2003 was interpreted as a pacifist doctrine
@entity3 foreign policy attempts to balance two sometimes conflicting goals , says @entity244
he says @entity3 has to take into account importance of migrants from former colonies
@entity3 intervention was desired by most @entity4 in @entity3 , *writes* @entity244
