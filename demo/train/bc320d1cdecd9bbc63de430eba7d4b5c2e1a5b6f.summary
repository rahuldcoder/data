-- earlier this summer , @entity1 , a disease detective with the @entity2 , entered a hut with her team in @entity5 , @entity6 , to speak with a man who had @entity8			1
their mission : to get the names of everyone he 'd had contact with while he was ill , so that they could stop those people from spreading the disease			2
" who lives with you here ? who has eaten off the same plate as you ? who has bathed you and taken care of you ? " they asked him			0
just his wife , the man answered			0
@entity1 and her team knew that was n't true			2
they knew he had children , and they knew that in @entity35 , families and even neighbors eat off the same plate and bathe and care for sick people			0
they explained to the man how important it was to stop @entity8 , and that his friends and family would be treated with respect			1
their pleas did n't work			2
@entity1 saw this scene play out over and over again			0
one of her colleagues at the @entity2 who 's worked in @entity48 says preliminary data shows they could be missing 40 to 60 % of the contacts of known @entity8 patients			1
" this is one of the hardest parts of the response , " said dr. @entity52 , a medical officer with the @entity2			0
she says she understands why @entity8 patients do n't want to name names : there was a rumor going around the communities she worked in that getting on a contact list meant you would die -- and the deaths would happen in the same order as they appeared on the list			1
" i understand they 're scared , " she said			0
" but it 's very frustrating			0
" the @entity8 outbreak in the @entity35 nations of @entity6 , @entity71 , @entity48 and @entity72 has killed nearly 1,500 people			1
just one contact left un-traced could go on to start a whole new line of @entity8 transmission			1
" it 's like fighting a forest fire			0
if you leave behind even one burning ember , one case undetected , it could reignite the epidemic , " dr. @entity80 , the director of the @entity2 , told reporters at a press conference earlier this summer			0
" contact tracing is a formidable challenge , " said dr. @entity88 , director - general of the @entity89			0
" in some areas , chains of transmission have moved underground			2
they are not being reported			0
" there 's no solid number of how many contacts have gone missing			1
@entity52 said the @entity2 arrived at the 40 to 60 % number because in some communities , each sick person has only listed an average of two contacts -- and households commonly have five or six people			1
@entity1 , an officer with the @entity2 's epidemic intelligence service , said when she and her team felt patients were n't being honest , they would try to get information from neighbors or community leaders			1
sometimes that helped , and sometimes it did n't			2
" unfortunately , there 's nothing we can do , " she said			0
" we ca n't force them " to give contacts			1
the @entity89 estimates that 10 % of contacts will go on to develop symptoms of @entity8			1
occasionally , some of these @entity8 cases go missing as well			1
" many families hide infected loved ones in their homes , " according to a @entity89 press release issued friday			0
@entity1 , who left @entity6 in the end of july , said she felt that the situation might improve as health care workers gain more trust in the community			1
but there 's another problem with that : the availability of workers to follow up with contacts			2
for example , in @entity71 , there are 2,000 contacts that need following , but the group @entity143 says they 've only been able to follow up with about 200 of them			2
the group 's teams in @entity71 and @entity48 are " stretched to the breaking point " as the epidemic is " spiraling out of control , " the group wrote in a press release			0
deadliest outbreak : what you need to know what happens when you survive @entity8 ? @entity0 's @entity157 contributed to this story .			1

preliminary data shows health officials are missing 40 to 60 % of contacts for @entity8 patients
many @entity8 patients do n't want to name names out of fear
just one contract left un-traced could start new line of @entity8 transmission
