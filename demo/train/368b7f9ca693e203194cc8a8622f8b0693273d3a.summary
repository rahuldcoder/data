@entity41 , a spokesman for @entity1 's prime minister , said that @entity1 " ended an @entity6 plot to attack strategic locations in @entity45 and @entity46 , " referring to a @entity1 port city and a southern province			1
" large numbers of government forces are making sure the @entity1 coasts are safe from any @entity6 attack			2
