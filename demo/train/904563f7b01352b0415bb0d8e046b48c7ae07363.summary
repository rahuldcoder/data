-- freeze ! step away from the stack of face masks and hazmat suits			0
" what 's more topical than @entity6 ? " you 're thinking			1
" it 's the perfect inspiration for a @entity9 costume , right ? ! " no. just ... no. using tragic current events as fodder for @entity9 costumes is nothing new , but it 's often a hackneyed and insensitive choice			1
" prom night toilet baby " was a popular costume after a spate of girls gave birth to secret babies at school , and a bloodied duo strolled into a party dressed as @entity23 and @entity24 just last year			1
this year , for just $ 59.99 on one costume e-tailer , sexy ebola containment suit can be yours			2
knee - slappers , right ? they might evoke a chuckle from the crasser among us , but do you really want to be the hero of the most obnoxious person at the party or , worse , the most - hated person on @entity37 ? photos have already surfaced of a bro dressed as former @entity41 @entity40 and dragging around a lifeless doll meant to stand in for domestic violence victim @entity43			1
@entity43 , a real person with actual feelings , weighed in on the tastelessness : " @ @entity47 it 's sad , that my suffering amuses others			2
" do n't be the guy wearing the cruel , uncreative costume			0
@entity52 is reeling from the first @entity6 cases transmitted on @entity55 soil			1
predictably , some local resident chose to decorate his front yard as a biohazard zone			0
it 's unclear how the families of those who are fighting for their lives feel about the stunt , but you 'd think fellow @entity52 denizens would have a little tact			0
" @entity70 ca n't buy empathy or good taste ( shaking my head ) , " @entity67 wrote to @entity0 @entity52 affiliate @entity68 on @entity69			0
that about sums it up			0
so maybe shelve the brilliant ideas that involve dead celebrities , biohazards , missing plane passengers , terrorists and domestic abusers			2
yep , it 's been a rough year , but why memorialize it around a spider - filled punchbowl at the office party ?			1

it 's been tragedy - filled year since last @entity9 : plane crashes , @entity6 , domestic abuse
@entity9 costumes tend to be popular but can also be tasteless and *hurtful*
one *reveler* dressed as @entity40 , who was *kicked* out of the @entity97 for domestic violence
it might be wise to skip insensitive costumes in favor of more creative choices
