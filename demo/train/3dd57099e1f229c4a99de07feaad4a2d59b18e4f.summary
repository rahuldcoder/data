fact is , the @entity2 can be a welcome , peaceful diversion from the nonstop energy ( read crowds ) of @entity3			1
the streets are wider , the buildings grander and thanks to nearly 1,000 acres of green space , the @entity2 is a place where you can catch your breath and take in your surroundings at a leisurely pace			1
you may know it as home of the @entity21 , a city of diplomats , the seat of the @entity26 government , the official residence of @entity28 and maybe even as the home of the notorious @entity30 , @entity31			1
( her former residence is the pretty but nondescript @entity34 16			2
) it 's also a city rich in the arts			1
less than an hour by train takes you to the @entity2 -- @entity2 -- from @entity3			1
here are a few of the most intriguing things to see when you go : @entity42 museum topping the list is this jewel box of a museum , which reopened on june 27 after a two - year renovation			1
the project connected the original 17th - century residential building to an early 20th - century building across the street via an underground passage			2
in the process , the museum doubled its size yet left most everything at street level unscathed			1
you 'll visit -- as everyone does -- to see @entity59 's " @entity60			1
" she 's flanked by two equally charming domestic scenes by @entity63 painter @entity62			2
in an adjacent room is " @entity65 " by @entity66 , now best known as cover art on @entity70 's @entity69 - winning novel			2
other paintings you 'll recognize include @entity73 's " @entity72 , " a portrait of @entity75 by @entity76 , " @entity77 " by @entity78 , and " @entity79 " by @entity80			2
the genius of the @entity42 is its small but exceptional collection -- 800 paintings , with about 260 on display here and another 150 at the @entity86			1
" as you go through the rooms you see masterpieces everywhere , " says museum director @entity87			2
" there is so much to see , but not too much			2
" @entity92 @entity93 at the opposite end of the @entity26 art continuum is @entity96 , the modern artist and proponent of the holistic art movement known as @entity99			1
the @entity93 contains the world 's largest collection of @entity96 's work presented in a chronological display that lets you appreciate the evolution of his style from realism to the abstract blocks of primary colors for which he 's famous			1
the highlight is " @entity113 , " left unfinished with bits of masking tape still in place on the surface of the canvas when @entity96 died in 1944			1
you 'll see it behind the waves of tourists posing in front of it , one of whom was president @entity127 when he visited the @entity2 for the @entity128 in march			1
the museum also has an excellent permanent collection of @entity132 ceramics and will open a major retrospective of @entity135 modern artist @entity134 starting september 20			2
www.gemeentemuseum.nl/en / @entity136 to the world at large , the @entity2 is most closely associated with the @entity136 , which houses the @entity21 , the judicial arm of the @entity139			1
constructed between 1907 and 1913 , the grand @entity136 seems to embody the international unity it was intended to foster : a @entity145 architect designed the structure built of @entity26 brick and @entity149 stone , with @entity151 iron gates at the entrance , @entity143 stained glass in the windows , a @entity155 clock in the clock tower and so on			1
ironically , @entity157 commenced a year after the @entity136 opened , effectively quashing the dreams of world peace its founders envisioned			1
although the visitors ' center is open regularly , guided tours of the building are conducted sporadically based on the court 's schedule			2
the current window for visits runs through august 27			0
if you happen to be in town , take advantage of the opportunity to see the @entity136 from the inside			1
should you be interested in watching international courts at work , trials at the @entity175 for the former @entity176 , in a separate courthouse nearby , are open to the public			2
@entity181 @entity182 the seat of the @entity26 parliament is @entity182 , a complex of buildings with roots that extend to the 13th century			0
the @entity188 , or @entity189 , is the most interesting and historic of them			0
in the 15th century , @entity191 , @entity192 , held meetings with his @entity194 here			0
his son , @entity195 , used it as a court of law			0
on its vaulted ceiling , made to resemble the inverted hull of a ship , are the carved heads of " eavesdroppers " -- little men with big ears who heard everything , prevented secrecy and conspiracy and ensured that justice was served			0
today , it 's a ceremonial venue , especially important on @entity213 ( the third tuesday of september ) , when the reigning monarch makes a speech to begin the new parliamentary year			0
@entity143 audio tours and brochures are available for the parliament buildings			0
tours with historical or political themes are conducted by @entity221 , a nonpartisan , government - funded , nonprofit created to educate the public and encourage participation in the political process			0
@entity226 @entity227 in @entity228 it 's rare to find an artist whose admirers include a devoted community of mathematicians , but such is the case with @entity227			1
the 20th - century artist is known for his graphic optical art linking infinity and impossibility , which famously inspired the great @entity241 mathematicians @entity239 and @entity242 ( not to mention the fashion designer @entity243 ) and has graced an incalculable number of dorm room walls			0
the @entity246 is actually three museums in one : the building itself is the former working palace of four generations of @entity26 queens ; the rooms contain whimsical crystal chandeliers by contemporary artist @entity254 ( @entity255 owns one ) ; and then of course there is the @entity227 artwork			1
all the museums mentioned here have programs designed to appeal to children , but @entity227 might be the artist that will blow their little minds ( in a good way ! ) , particularly when they reach the optical illusion room			1
@entity267 / @entity268 and speaking of optical illusion ... long before the @entity272 theater , people wrapped their heads around the panoramic paintings of the 19th century -- full 360 - degree visual experiences intended to transport the viewer to another place and time			0
in their heyday there were hundreds of them , depicting subjects from ancient @entity282 to the battle of @entity284 , each displayed like a carnival attraction in a cylindrical structure specially built for the purpose			0
only 23 survive ( one is the @entity290 in @entity291 , @entity292 , depicting @entity293 )			0
the @entity268 , painted by @entity294 in just four months , is one of the finest examples , not least because it 's displayed in its original structure			0
although you 're standing just 14 meters ( 45 feet ) away from the 120 - by - 14 - meter ( 393 - by - 45 - foot ) canvas , your eye is fooled into believing you 're seeing the @entity26 seaside resort of @entity301 from a great distance			0
because the painting is illuminated by natural light , the view literally changes with the time of day and the weather			0
in its quiet way , it 's a marvel			0
even @entity309 thought so ; he attended the panorama 's opening in 1881			0
panorama - @entity313 @entity301 the real seaside at @entity301 is a quick tram ride or an easy bike ride from the city center			2
it no longer resembles the 19th - century coastal enclave depicted in the @entity268 , but it remains a popular " day out " spot for residents of the @entity2			1
the centerpiece is the @entity323 , a 19th - century bath hotel that gained a certain infamy when the @entity326 played there on august 8 , 1964			0
they were four songs into their set when a riot ensued , and police were called in to shut down the show			0
that event largely ended the hotel 's days as a rock venue , although @entity336 played there in 2010			0
the beach offers a boardwalk lined with kiosks and amusements , a lighthouse and the chance to cool your toes in the @entity346 , plus the picturesque dunes that have drawn nature lovers to the area for centuries .			0

the @entity2 is home to the newly renovated @entity42 museum
" @entity60 " is among its most notable works
@entity96 and @entity227 also have ties in the city
the @entity136 embodies international unity
