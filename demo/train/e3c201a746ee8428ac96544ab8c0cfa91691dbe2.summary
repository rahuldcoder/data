-- a @entity2 , @entity3 , newlywed accused of pushing her husband from a cliff wants her trial postponed after prosecutors told her attorney they have evidence her husband was blindfolded before falling to his death , court documents say			1
saying the prosecution has provided no evidence regarding the use of a blindfold -- which could be used to make the government 's case for premeditation and thus first - degree murder -- @entity21 's attorney , @entity20 , asserts that he is unprepared to defend his client if the trial is held in december as planned			1
@entity20 further said he learned of the " blindfold theory " and the dna testing of " a piece of cloth found on a shoal in the river " only during an october 25 conference call , more than three weeks after it was sent to an @entity32 lab and 10 weeks after it was collected from the alleged crime scene			1
that timing is important , the attorney says , because if the " alleged blindfold " was not sent to a lab until at least october 2 , the day before the indictment was filed , it " would suggest the blindfold theory was not put to the grand jury at all			0
" " if , as is stated in the complaint affidavit , @entity44 and @entity45 ( @entity46 ) were arguing intensely on the ledge , it hardly seems plausible that the argument would cease abruptly so @entity44 could apply a blindfold , " says @entity20 's brief supporting a motion to dismiss the case			0
" frankly at this point the defense has no idea of how the government intends to try this case before the petite jury and likewise has grave doubt about what was put before the grand jury			0
" @entity20 further slams the @entity32 and @entity58 for its handling of @entity21 's interrogation and subsequent report based on that interrogation			1
the case is being handled federally because the alleged crime happened in a national park			0
the report , which alleges an @entity32 interrogator inappropriately touched @entity21 's knee during the interview , states that almost an hour and a half of @entity21 's interrogation was not recorded , despite the necessary equipment being on hand			1
failing to preserve such evidence , which includes @entity21 's first admission that she had previously lied , is a violation of @entity21 's rights , the defense brief says			1
other parts of the interview were misconstrued or provided without necessary context , according to the papers filed by @entity20 , which labels the government 's version of @entity21 's statement " incomplete , coerced and subject to suppression			2
" " the whole recorded part of the interrogation was an epic effort by ( the interrogator ) to isolate key words that would at a minimum support a voluntary manslaughter theory ; with enough room for the argument that @entity44 could have walked away , which might even support a theory of depraved heart for first - or second - degree murder , " the court brief states			1
it continues , " at best this synopsis is a decontextualized , exaggerated interpretation that was intended to distort and contradict what @entity44 actually reported			0
" @entity21 has pleaded not guilty to charges of first - degree murder , second - degree murder and making false statements			1
on july 7 , just more than a week after they got married , @entity21 and her husband were arguing at @entity3 's @entity113 , according to court affidavits			1
@entity21 said in a court filing that during the argument , @entity46 grabbed her by the arm and she removed it , pushing @entity46 simultaneously and accidentally sending him off the cliff , according to court documents			1
the complaint against her says , " @entity21 stated she could have just walked away , but due to her anger , she pushed @entity46 with both hands in the back and as a result , he fell face first off the cliff			2
" @entity20 's brief takes issue with how the incident was cast in the complaint and accuses the interrogator of twisting her words to fit certain charges			0
in september , @entity20 said @entity46 pinned his wife down during their argument and that when @entity46 grabbed @entity21 's arm , she jerked it away and shoved him " all in one motion , the grabbing and pushing			1
" @entity21 did not report the incident			2
she initially told police @entity46 had left in a dark vehicle the night of july 7 with unknown friends			0
on july 11 , according to an affidavit , @entity21 led a party to a popular spot in the park called " @entity152 , " where @entity46 's body was located and she called authorities			2
" @entity155 commented to @entity21 he thought it was unusual that she had found the body			2
@entity21 replied , ' it was a place he wanted to see before he died , ' and ' he would come up here with friends to drive fast when his friends were visiting from out of state , ' " the affidavit states			0
five days later , @entity21 came clean during the @entity32 interrogation , telling the interrogator that she lied but that @entity46 's death was an accident , according to the defense brief			1
" i was afraid that they were n't going to give me a chance to explain things and they were just gon na kind of put me in handcuffs and take me away right there and say that i had committed a crime or that i had planned this to kill somebody , " she said , according to the brief			0
the affidavit states that @entity21 texted a friend the night her husband died , saying she was going to talk to @entity46 about having " second thoughts			2
" @entity21 texted , " oh well , i am about to talk to him			0
" her friend responded , " i 'll pray for you guys			0
" @entity21 then replied , " dead serious , if u do n't hear from me at all again tonight , something happened , " according to a court document filed in the case			0
@entity0 's @entity196 and @entity197 contributed to this report .			0
