@entity0 , @entity2 's longtime ally , has vexed @entity3 for years with its rocket launches , nuclear tests , kidnapping of @entity2 fishermen and other erratic behavior			1
yet , @entity3 has run interference at the @entity11 to temper punishments against @entity13 , and has even helped @entity13 circumvent sanctions			0
in the wake of @entity0 's third nuclear test in february , its reckless threats to strike the @entity18 , and now -- its decision to scrap the armistice that ended the @entity21 -- has @entity2 finally had enough ? @entity3 signed on to sanctions that , in the words of @entity23 , @entity18 ambassador to the @entity11 , will " bite and bite hard			1
" @entity2 's ambassador to the @entity11 declared @entity3 's commitment to " safeguarding peace and stability on the @entity28			1
" one should n't exaggerate the significance of these recent developments			0
after all , in the @entity11 negotiations over sanctions -- this time as before -- the @entity2 have consistently played the role of watering down the degree of punishment imposed against @entity13			0
and in the past @entity2 firms have helped @entity0 evade sanctions			1
it remains to be seen whether @entity3 intends to enforce the new measures			0
as rhetoric heats up , @entity0 ready to ' rain bullets on the enemy ' @entity3 also has good reasons that continue to make it reluctant to crack down on its unruly ally			1
the @entity2 perceive that they have a powerful interest in maintaining the status quo			1
as hard as it is to live with @entity0 , @entity3 fears it may be harder to live without it			1
the @entity2 worry that coming down hard on @entity13 , by cutting off their vital oil or food exports , could trigger a collapse of the @entity0 government or other political instability on the peninsula			1
@entity3 's nightmares include a loose nukes problem and a humanitarian disaster			0
@entity3 also has fears about the effects of a @entity0 collapse on the strategic balance in @entity63			1
if @entity0 collapsed and the two @entity64 unified , @entity2 might find astride its border a unified , @entity18 - aligned @entity0 hosting @entity18 troops			1
@entity2 analysts also commonly argue that @entity0 serves as an important distraction for the @entity18 military , which might otherwise train its focus on defending @entity71			1
thus , despite the nuisance that @entity0 regularly makes of itself , for all these reasons , it would be sorely missed by @entity3			2
@entity0 declares 1953 armistice invalid but the days of " lips and teeth " ( @entity78 's famous statement about the closeness of @entity81 relations ) are clearly over			0
@entity2 scholars and analysts increasingly express open frustration with @entity13 's behavior			0
in the wake of @entity0 piracy against @entity2 fishermen , @entity2 microblogs overflowed with outrage			2
most recently , in a meeting of an advisory group to the @entity2 government -- the @entity95 -- participants openly debated the question : whether to " keep or dump " @entity0 ? the two countries have evolved from vitriolic bffs to @entity63 's odd couple			2
when @entity2 and @entity0 formed their alliance , the countries were both poor , weak , resentful , isolated , and the target of cold - war containment by the @entity18 and its allies			2
while @entity0 is still that country , @entity2 is emphatically not			2
@entity2 's remarkable four decades of economic reform and growth have catapulted it to wealth and power -- @entity2 is a global power , with global interests			0
@entity2 has a deep stake in maintaining stability in order to sustain its pathway to prosperity			0
@entity2 's relationship with the @entity18 can be tense			0
but quite unlike in the days of @entity78 , the two countries are vital trade partners that share a vast array of ties and often overlapping interests			0
a look at @entity0 's escalating rhetoric @entity3 also values its relationship with @entity124 , which @entity13 's provocations seriously jeopardize			2
booming trade flows , warm political relations , and deeply intertwined ties have created a relationship that makes it increasingly awkward for @entity3 to look away when @entity0 murders @entity124 as it did in 2010 ( with the sinking of the @entity124 vessel @entity133 that killed 46 sailors , and when it shelled @entity135 )			0
@entity2 is a great power that is increasingly concerned with its standing in the world , and with cultivating " soft power			0
" @entity3 's support for @entity0 's ruthless , bloody regime -- that attacks its neighbors , and brutalizes its people at home -- only draws attention to @entity2 's own human rights failings , and undermines @entity2 's soft power			1
because the specter of @entity0 's collapse could potentially destabilize the @entity0 peninsula , @entity3 may continue to shield @entity13			1
but the two countries ' increasingly divergent interests suggest that @entity2 's dissatisfaction with @entity0 is only likely to grow .			0

@entity0 officials said the @entity156 is to be scrapped
@entity158 : even @entity3 signed on to sanctions against its longtime ally
has @entity2 finally had enough ? but she says @entity2 may still prefer the status quo
