the killing of a 32 - year - old man on the streets of @entity3 with a hammer was savage , random and senseless -- but it was not , that city 's mayor said , related to what 's been happening in nearby @entity9 , @entity10			1
the @entity3 metropolitan area remains on edge , a week after a grand jury decided not to indict then - @entity14 police officer @entity14 in the shooting death of unarmed teen @entity16			1
that decision spurred emotional protests that sometimes devolved into looting and violence , unrest that carried racial overtones given that @entity14 is white and @entity16 was @entity23			0
but any claim that 32 - year - old @entity28 's brutal killing had anything to do with this @entity14 uproar " is absolutely unfounded , " @entity3 mayor @entity24 said monday on @entity25			1
" there is no evidence that this was a crime occasioned by the race or ethnicity of the victim , " @entity24 wrote in reference to @entity32 , who was white			1
the mayor made these comments after meeting with the family of @entity32 , who was beaten to death a hammer around 1:15 a.m. sunday on a @entity3 street			1
" i told them that our city mourned with them , " @entity24 said			2
" ... an innocent life was savagely taken			0
" according to a probable cause statement , @entity32 , his @entity51 and two others heard yelling and then someone jumped on the back of his car			0
the 32 - year - old got out , at which point a teenager -- identified by prosecutors as @entity61 -- taunted @entity32 and " challenged him to a fight			1
" then , " all four men began assaulting ( @entity32 ) , and at least one of them struck ( him ) with a hammer , " the probable cause statement added , noting the attackers continued to beat @entity32 after he fell to the ground			0
he was unconscious by the time officers arrived , and pronounced dead after being taken to an area hospital			0
as to his attackers , police said that , " after the assault , the juveniles fled the scene on foot			2
" two of them -- juveniles age 15 and 16 -- were arrested later sunday			2
a third teen was in custody by monday , at which point authorities said they were still looking for a fourth suspect			1
speaking about the attackers , mayor @entity24 wrote on @entity25 that " we do not know their past			2
" " their futures , though , will be as grim as the judicial system can make it , " he added			0
police will review patrol patterns in the @entity101 area , where the attack occurred			2
yet @entity24 scuttled any suggestion that they were somehow to blame			0
" it is not the police department 's fault that no family members had any idea that their young people were on the streets that late , " @entity24 said			1
" nor is it the police department 's responsibility to educate or even to engage these young people			0
" that responsibility , a community responsibility , is all of ours			0

a 32 - year - old man died after being assaulted sunday by a group , at least 1 with a hammer
three juveniles have been arrested ; police are still looking for a fourth suspect
@entity3 mayor : " no evidence " that victim 's race or ethnicity was related to attack
