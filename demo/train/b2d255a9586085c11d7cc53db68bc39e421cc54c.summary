pope @entity1 has accepted the invitation of @entity4 archbishop @entity3 to attend the @entity5 in @entity4 next year , @entity0 reported friday			1
it would be the popular pontiff 's first visit to the @entity9 as @entity1			1
the news service , the official publication of the @entity12 , said @entity3 made the announcement thursday before giving his homily during the opening @entity16 in @entity17			0
" @entity1 has told me that he is coming , " said the archbishop as he invited his fellow @entity19 to the celebration being held in @entity4 on september 22 - 27 , 2015			1
@entity1 has received invitations to visit other places in the @entity9 as well , which he is considering , @entity22 spokesman the rev. @entity21 told @entity0			1
those invitations include @entity26 , the @entity27 and @entity28			0
in a statement , the @entity29 said official confirmation from the @entity22 for the trip will likely be given about six months before the @entity5			0
" archbishop @entity3 has frequently shared his confidence in @entity1 ' attendance at the @entity5 and his personal conversations with the @entity38 are the foundation for that confidence , " the archdiocese said			2
" while archbishop @entity3 's comments do not serve as official confirmation , they do serve to bolster our sincere hope that @entity4 will welcome @entity1 next september , " the archdiocese added			1
the @entity22 , which does not typically confirm papal trips until several months before their scheduled date , said the @entity1 has " indicated his willingness " to visit @entity4 but has not made " concrete plans " yet			2
" keep in mind that we are still one year away from the @entity4 meeting , " @entity21 said in a statement on friday			0
a visit by @entity1 , the first @entity1 from @entity55 , would resonate with the nation 's growing @entity55 population			1
" the @entity62 population is growing in the @entity9 , and with the vast majority being @entity0 , having the first @entity1 from @entity55 come to visit will be very exciting , " said bishop @entity58 of @entity59 , @entity60			1
@entity64 , a professor of public policy at the @entity66 , said a @entity9 visit by the @entity68 @entity1 would be symbolically powerful for @entity69 -- many of whom have slipped away from the @entity72 for evangelical sects			2
" @entity75 have probably seen themselves less reflected in the hierarchy than their numbers might mirror , " @entity64 told @entity74			0
" there are more @entity75 bishops now than a few years ago , but the @entity55 hierarchy still reflects the old @entity72 dominated by the @entity81 and , to a certain extent , @entity83 and other people of @entity86 origins , " he said			0
" having a @entity55 pope who is going to be speaking native @entity88 to @entity69 in the @entity9 will be the first time they see themselves reflected so powerfully in the church hierarchy			0
" the @entity93 generally meets in september , leading to speculation that @entity1 might combine the @entity4 trip with a stop in @entity26 to address the @entity27			2
