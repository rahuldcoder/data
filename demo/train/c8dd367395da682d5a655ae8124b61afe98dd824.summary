@entity0 -- with @entity7 democrat @entity6 's announcement this week that he will not seek re-election this year , the recent string of @entity4 retirements has the political class debating whether @entity10 have a real shot at taking control of the upper chamber			1
but this biennial parlor game overlooks a stunning dynamic that has been developing on @entity16 over the past decade : massive turnover			0
think back to late 2004 , when a young hotshot from @entity19 had just been elected to the @entity4			1
national tv appearances led to obvious questions about his future political plans , but the senator - elect joked that he would finish out a full term , considering he was entering the upper chamber as its 99th - ranking member			0
consider this : â € ¢ if @entity29 had stayed in the @entity4 , he would be ranked 46th today			1
given all the retirements that have been announced for the 2014 election cycle , he 'd be ranked at least as high as 39th -- and maybe higher -- in early 2015			0
in other words , he would have taken a giant leap in seniority had he waited until 2016 to run for president			0
â € ¢ only 32 current senators were in office in 2001 for the september 11 attacks			0
that number will shrink to 28 -- perhaps even lower -- when the next @entity40 convenes in early 2015			0
â € ¢ since the @entity10 last had the @entity4 majority headed into the 2006 midterm elections , 54 new senators have joined the chamber			1
( fifteen new members have been sworn in since last fall 's election ; 14 new members joined after the 2010 election and another 15 after the 2008 election			1
there were 12 new senators as of the 2006 elections -- and 11 of those remain			0
@entity54 democrat @entity53 served just one term and was succeeded by @entity57 @entity56			0
) a few lions of the @entity4 remain , like @entity60 democrat @entity59			1
the @entity4 's most - senior member has served 38 years			1
but so many of his contemporaries have left the building			0
this year , @entity54 democrat @entity64 , @entity66 democrat @entity65 and @entity68 democrat @entity67 decided to call it quits after 30 years each			0
@entity71 democrat @entity70 , who is also not seeking re-election next year , will have 36 years of @entity4 service to his name when his successor takes office in early 2015			1
@entity4 passes its first budget proposal in four years last cycle , it was @entity81 's @entity80 ( @entity82 ) , @entity84 's @entity83 ( r ) , @entity86 's @entity85 ( @entity87 ) and @entity89 's @entity88 ( @entity82 ) , among many more			1
in recent years , the @entity4 has lost @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity92 and @entity93 to death in office			1
other long - time senators like @entity97 and @entity98 have moved to the executive branch			1
consequently , a much different @entity4 is emerging			1
the first @entity102 - @entity101 woman , @entity103 , and the first openly gay woman , @entity104 , joined the @entity4 this year			1
the country 's most exclusive club boasts a record number of women , 20 ; a @entity109 and an @entity101 @entity10 both in their 40s ; and a growing number of senators with young children ( and who still are many years away from grandchildren )			1
another case in point : if a @entity57 succeeds @entity65 in deep - blue @entity66 , it could be @entity120 mayor @entity119 , who is running for the open seat			0
@entity65 at 89 years old is more than twice the age of @entity119 , who is 43			0
and on the other side of the aisle , aggressive conservatives are shaking things up , too			1
already running for @entity6 's seat in @entity7 is 58 - year - old @entity128 gov. @entity128			1
but the @entity129 blasted @entity128 on tuesday for not being conservative enough			0
@entity10 campaign sources say the group has met with @entity132 rep. @entity132 to recruit her into the race instead			1
@entity132 , a 41 - year - old mother of three , is quietly considering the race			2
of course , @entity135 have their own younger options , like former rep. @entity137 , 42 ; or @entity6 's son , @entity140 attorney @entity139 , 38			0
even though party leaders on both sides of the aisle like to keep retirements each cycle to a minimum , @entity135 operatives say they 're not disappointed in the predicament this year , because those with access to early polling data in states like @entity54 and @entity7 say some of the younger , newer faces in those states are polling better against potential @entity10 opponents than the veteran senators did			1
@entity4 historian @entity156 says that overall , the trend is a cyclical one , but he acknowledges that the current dynamic stands out			2
" we have 45 senators serving in their first six - year term , " he said			1
" it 's quite remarkable			0
it 's the largest turnover we 've had since the late 1970s			0
" @entity156 remembers a long list of retirements in 1976 and 1978 , followed by a rout of veteran senators in 1980			2
" this is a very personality - driven institution , " he said			0
" when you change some of these larger - than - life personalities , it really changes the place			0
" @entity156 expects that some of the newer members will become veteran , seasoned members in time for a new generation , but he conceded that the brain drain in the upper chamber does infringe on some of the important expertise			0
indeed , according to a handful of experienced @entity186 who have worked in and around the @entity4 , the heavy turnover cuts both ways			2
leadership aides close to @entity4 minority leader @entity189 say that he and some of his staff believe there 's more energy in the upper chamber now and more of a willingness to fight for causes			2
despite some of the nostalgia surrounding some of the old bulls who were more comfortable compromising and cutting deals , they believe the @entity10 conference is working harder than ever			2
@entity135 @entity4 aides say a positive outcome of the @entity4 's changing face is that @entity140 may now find them more relatable			2
and it makes the tough task of recruiting new candidates easier with a diverse caucus because more potential recruits can actually see themselves in the @entity4			2
@entity208 , a @entity10 , and @entity209 , a @entity57 , were longtime and highly influential staffers within the @entity4 leadership			1
@entity212 joins fellow senators supporting same - sex marriage both harbor typical complaints about the opposing party , but they both long for the days of compromise , when some of the younger , newer members respected their elders			1
" making the @entity4 work requires cooperation and compromise , " @entity208 said			2
" deal - making and compromise have never been ' easy , ' but the leaders forced it on the rank - and - file			0
" @entity208 , who advised former @entity10 majority leader @entity229 , continued , " @entity231 division in the country and ' compromise equals weakness ' is reflected in the younger members			1
great political strategy but not conducive to governing			0
" @entity209 advised the first @entity135 majority leader after @entity229 , @entity239			0
now outside the @entity4 , he complained about some of the same things : that the massive turnover also means a loss of institutional knowledge			2
" there 's no one to negotiate with in the @entity247 with a @entity10 caucus full of tea party types , " he said			2
" after 21 years in the @entity4 , i 've come reluctantly to the conclusion that the process on @entity16 is broken			2
" @entity209 continued , " times have changed , and the @entity4 's changed			0
it 's the influx of new members from the @entity247 that brought all the bad habits they developed in the @entity247			0
" and citing @entity257 @entity10 @entity256 , he said , " this is a potent group of freshmen who have no respect for the @entity4 as an institution , who would rather burn the place down so they can remake it again			1

with departures of long - serving members , a new @entity4 is emerging
first @entity102 - @entity101 woman and first openly gay woman joined @entity4 this year
record number of women now serve and growing number of senators have young children
aggressive conservatives are shaking up makeup of @entity10 side of the aisle
