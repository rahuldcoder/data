-- on tuesday , our nation will celebrate the 150th anniversary of the @entity4			1
president @entity5 spoke for only two minutes			1
he started off by reminding his audience that it had been only 87 years since the country 's founding , and then went on to embolden the @entity11 cause with some of the most stirring words ever spoken			1
he hoped that despite the terrible battle that had taken place at @entity16 , his country might still have , as he put it , " a new birth of freedom			0
" within his famous address , he stated , " the world will little note , nor long remember what we say here , but it can never forget what they did here			2
" yet a century and a half later , we still honor those sacred words he spoke on the battlefield in @entity31 as some of the most important words ever spoken			1
it is my hope that @entity37 across our great nation will take this occasion to look deeper into the history and legacy of the @entity4 and the great sacrifices for freedom @entity5 honored in the midst of the @entity45			1
a great way to start is by simply picking up the brief speech and reading it aloud			0
read it to your children , your parents and your friends			0
as you read this timeless piece of oratory , engage in a discussion with those around you on what these words mean to us today			1
let us ask ourselves how it is these words have endured the test of time , especially in current times			2
we suffer today from what the late historian @entity66 said was " too much pluribus and not enough unum			2
" few things survive in these cynical days to remind us of the union from which so many of our personal , as well as collective , blessings flow			0
indeed , we have to look no further than the story of a tiny school in @entity76 , @entity77 , the @entity78 , to understand why this speech above so many others survives			2
each year at the school students are challenged to memorize and then publicly recite the @entity4			1
these students , boys 11 to 17 , all face a range of complex learning differences that make their personal , academic and social progress challenging			0
i was inspired by these students and that president @entity5 's historic words motivated them , so much that i am launching today an initiative to encourage as many people across the nation , especially students , to read aloud and learn about the @entity4			1
all five living @entity37 presidents , as well as newsmakers and notable @entity37 from across the country , have already submitted videos of themselves reciting the address to @entity98			2
in the tradition of our great democracy , anyone who wishes to participate can join us in doing the same			2
as we consider @entity5 's words , we come to a greater appreciation of the significance of that day , just four and a half months after the @entity16 , when the president of the @entity37 journeyed to the now - quiet battlefield to dedicate a cemetery to those who fell in the greatest battle ever fought on @entity37 soil , in a war that had torn our fragile @entity113 in two			1
it is my hope , and that of so many people who have helped with the " learn the address " initiative , that we embrace the 150th anniversary and take this opportunity to more fully understand our democracy and our freedom			1
that we all discover the @entity4 beyond " four score and seven years ago			1
" in doing so , we hope to appreciate more fully " that this nation , under @entity126 , shall have a new birth of freedom -- and that the government of the people , by the people , for the people , shall not perish from the earth			0
" + + + the @entity4 : four score and seven years ago , our fathers brought forth on this continent , a new nation , conceived in @entity138 and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal			1
now we are engaged in a great @entity45 , testing whether that nation , or any nation so conceived and so dedicated , can long endure			1
we are met on a great battlefield of that war			0
we have come to dedicate a portion of that field , as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live			0
it is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this			0
but , in a larger sense , we can not dedicate -- we can not consecrate -- we can not hallow -- this ground			0
the brave men , living and dead , who struggled here , have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or detract			0
the world will little note , nor long remember what we say here , but it can never forget what they did here			0
it is for us the living , rather , to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced			0
it is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us -- that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion -- that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain -- that this nation , under @entity126 , shall have a new birth of freedom -- and that government of the people , by the people , for the people , shall not perish from the earth			0
