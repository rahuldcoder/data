-- can @entity2 's motion - tracking webcams see black people ? it 's a question posed on a now - viral @entity6 video and the company says it 's looking into it			1
in the video , two co-workers take turns in front of the camera -- the webcam appears to follow @entity15 as she sways in front of the screen and stays still as @entity18 moves about			1
@entity2 acknowledged in a statement e-mailed to @entity0 that the cameras may have issues with contrast recognition in certain lighting situations			1
the webcams , built into @entity2 's new computers , are supposed to keep people 's faces and bodies in proportion and centered on the screen as they move			1
the video went viral over the weekend , garnering more than 400,000 @entity6 page views and a slew of comments on @entity35			0
it was something neither @entity15 nor @entity18 expected to happen			0
@entity15 said she and @entity18 , her co-worker , were playing around with the computer at work and testing it when they stumbled upon the facial recognition feature			2
@entity18 and @entity15 said they were laughing when they realized the camera followed her and not him			2
" we thought it was pretty funny , we thought it was hilarious , " @entity15 said			0
so they made a video , which they planned to just share with friends on @entity53 and @entity6			0
there was no script , no rehearsal , just two friends filming what they thought was a hilarious software glitch			1
so again , the two took turns in front of the camera			2
" as soon as my blackness enters the frame , it stopped , " @entity18 says in the video			0
" @entity68 gets in there , no face recognition anymore , buddy , " he says			0
@entity6 : watch the video " i think my blackness is interfering with the computer 's ability to follow me , " he continues			1
but now that the video has gotten so much attention , the two co-workers want everyone , including @entity2 , to know they never intended the video to spark a discussion about whether the webcam was racist			1
@entity15 said she liked the computer so much , she suggested @entity18 get one for his wife			0
" the intent was definitely not to go after @entity2 , it just so happened the computer was an @entity2 and we recognized the software glitch , " @entity18 said			1
" we did it for laughs , but if the video does make @entity2 put out a better product , then great , " @entity15 added			2
@entity2 was quick to react , too			2
the company quickly posted on the it 's blog , @entity96 , on sunday after the video went viral , responding to concerns			0
" the technology we use is built on standard algorithms that measure the difference in intensity of contrast between the eyes and the upper cheek and nose , " wrote @entity99 , the lead social media strategist for @entity2 's @entity101			1
" we believe that the camera might have difficulty ' seeing ' contrast in conditions where there is insufficient foreground lighting			1
" @entity96 : read the statement on @entity2 's blog meanwhile , @entity99 pointed users facing similar problems to @entity2 's help page , which provides guidance on how to change the lighting or other optimization settings on the camera			1
@entity2 : see the @entity2 help page on monday @entity2 also told @entity0 in a corporate statement that the issue is most likely related to lighting , but they are looking into the situation further			2
" @entity2 has been informed of a potential issue with facial - tracking software			1
consistent with other webcams , proper foreground lighting is required for the product to effectively track any person and their movements , " the statement said			0
" as with all our products , we continue to explore refinements which help to optimize their use			0
" @entity18 and @entity15 said they 've heard similar feedback from commenters online offering ideas on fixing the lighting			0
the co-workers ' video has also sparked others to try the product			0
after media coverage of the @entity6 video , @entity151 did its own testing of the product to see if the @entity6 video portrayal was accurate			0
consumerreports.org : watch testing of the webcam feature in standard lighting , the webcam did n't move with an @entity161 male as it did with a white male			2
but after lighting sources were added , the webcam was able to track the @entity161 - @entity161 male 's face and movements			1
@entity0 's @entity167 and @entity168 contributed to this report .			0

new : @entity172 was meant to be *humorous* showing of software glitch , co-workers say
co-workers : motion - tracking webcam moves with white wo*man* , not black *man*
" i think my blackness is interfering with the computer 's ability to follow me , " user says
@entity2 : " camera may have trouble ' seeing ' contrast " in poor lighting conditions
