" and i do feel that i 've done a great deal to expand the parameters of free speech			1
" the " @entity19 " magazine publisher , free speech advocate , and the man whom @entity9 called " @entity2 's king of porn " will be a guest on wednesday 's " @entity8			1
" @entity1 's new book , " @entity21 : how the private lives of presidents , @entity27 , and their lovers changed the @entity29 , " presents an in - depth study of the sex lives of @entity2 presidents			1
@entity1 told @entity9 that he reached out to @entity31 history professor @entity30 when he decided to write the book partly because " nobody would want to read a history book written by a pornographer			1
" @entity1 and @entity30 's research uncovered facts about presidents that they themselves unearthed			1
for example , the youngest - ever first lady was 19			0
after @entity43 's wife died during the campaign , he married his young nanny			0
" what does that mean , culturally speaking , " asked @entity1			2
" today we would not accept an 18 or 19 - year - old girl as first lady			0
" when @entity9 asked who the most sexually promiscuous president was , @entity1 said it was a toss - up between @entity54 and @entity55			2
@entity9 also asked if a rumor that @entity55 would have been disgraced in a year or so -- had he not been assassinated -- were true , @entity1 said it was " probably true			2
" in the book , @entity1 refers to @entity59 as " the loveable rogue " because even though he lied , @entity59 " always wore it on his sleeve			1
he did n't hide it like many of the conservative republicans do			0
so the nation was able to forgive him			0
" sex scandals have been prevalent since the founding fathers established the @entity69			0
@entity1 pointed out that @entity70 fathered children with one of his slaves , and first lady @entity76 " almost single handedly turned the @entity74 into a brothel			2
" @entity1 also stated that " most people are under the impression that if somebody is promiscuous that they ca n't be a good president			2
there 's nothing more ridiculous than that			0
" when @entity9 asked whether " most of the greatest @entity2 presidents would have been unfaithful , " @entity1 replied " yes , " to which @entity9 observed " there seems to be a link between naughty boys and good presidents			1
" @entity1 was nearly assassinated in 1978 when he was shot outside a courthouse			1
no one was ever charged in the shooting , but @entity1 maintains the sniper was a white man upset about an interracial photo shoot published in " @entity19			1
" @entity1 remains partially paralyzed and uses a wheelchair			2
@entity1 told @entity9 that he does n't look back at that day and that when people ask him what being in a wheelchair is like , he tells them he " would n't have even thought about it " had they not mentioned it			1
@entity9 also asked @entity1 why the issue of freedom of speech means so much to him			1
" freedom of speech is not freedom for the fellow you love , " answered @entity1			2
" it 's freedom for the fellow you hate the most			0
and a democracy ca n't exist without free speech and the right to assemble			1
and that 's what @entity2 tend to forget			0
and they 're born into a culture where they take all of their freedoms for granted			0
" " when i first started out , " continued @entity1 , " i used to buy into a former @entity121 's argument that you ca n't scream fire in a crowded theater			2
well , i think you can			0
" @entity9 asked @entity1 what his preferred news headline would be following his death , " @entity1 , pornographer , " " @entity1 , free speech campaigner , " or " @entity131 , lifelong controversialist			1
" @entity1 told @entity9 he wanted something " much bigger than that			0
i always felt @entity135 freed the @entity136 , @entity137 freed the slaves , and i wanted to free all the neurotics			0
and i realized in the process that i 've helped millions of people get through puberty			0
i think that 's a great accomplishment			0
