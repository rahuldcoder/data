@entity1 - @entity0 have had an outsized influence in keeping the @entity0 embargo since @entity4 seized power			1
now a younger generation , with strong familial ties there but far removed from the memories of @entity4 's revolution , want the embargo to end			1
" asking whether someone is for or against the embargo was a good question in 1962 , " said @entity12 , a 31 - year - old @entity13 - born marketing executive in @entity14			1
" we 've allowed this policy to become the 800 - pound gorilla in the room and a distraction from the atrocities of the regime , the human rights abuses , and the aspirations of the @entity1 people , " he added			2
@entity12 says his grandfather was murdered by the @entity4 regime			0
@entity12 's father , who he says witnessed the killing , fought in the @entity33			0
according to analysts , as more @entity1 - @entity0 millennials begin to question the embargo , more will begin to abandon their @entity38 roots for the @entity39 , like @entity12 did			1
@entity39 have long - hoped to make inroads with @entity41 , the only @entity43 group that still leans @entity38 , and have taken notice of the generational shift			1
former secretary of state , @entity47 , deemed the clear front - runner for the @entity39 presidential nomination in 2016 , recently said she would like to see the @entity0 move toward normalizing relations with @entity1			1
" i think it has propped up the @entity54 because they can blame everything on the embargo , " she said during a july interview on @entity52			2
@entity57 reached out for comment but no one from @entity61 's office was immediately available for a response			0
this year 's @entity64 gubernatorial race will measure just how strong the @entity38 's grasp on @entity41 remains			1
incumbent @entity66 gov. @entity66 who supports the embargo faces former @entity38 - now - @entity68 governor @entity68 who during a july campaign stop in @entity13 's @entity70 openly called for an end to the embargo , a move that had been considered political suicide in the state			1
at a debate sponsored by @entity57 in @entity64 earlier this week , @entity68 said he would n't be willing to go so far as meeting with @entity78 , but he defended his opposition to the embargo			2
" the embargo has been in place for over 50 years , it has not worked			1
the intent of the embargo was to get rid of the @entity4 brothers			2
they 're still there , " @entity68 said			0
related : @entity64 debate turns bitter " the message that worked well in the past -- @entity94 -- and moved older @entity1 to vote @entity38 , is not as impactful for younger @entity0 born @entity1 , " said @entity92 , a managing partner at @entity93 , a political consulting firm			0
he says messages of employment , economic recovery and fixing the broken immigration system is what resonates with this group			0
it 's not just @entity41 , many young @entity101 are questioning the embargo			1
twenty nine - year - old old @entity105 - based writer @entity104 , who is of @entity106 and @entity108 descent , says people in his generation feel that " it 's about damn time " for the embargo to end			1
@entity104 says that he and every other millennial he knows desperately want the opportunity to travel to @entity1 -- even those that are not @entity1			0
" i do n't believe that [ being of @entity1 descent ] matters , " @entity104 said			0
" as an @entity0 , i have a vested interest in the policies of my government not only towards its own citizens , but also towards the citizens of other countries			0
" on oct. 11 , the @entity123 joined the anti-embargo chorus			0
" for the first time in more than 50 years , shifting politics in the @entity0 and changing policies in @entity1 make it politically feasible to re-establish formal diplomatic relations and dismantle the senseless embargo " , wrote the @entity123 ' editorial board			1
" the generation that adamantly supports the embargo is dying off			1
@entity133 hold starkly different views , having come to see the sanctions as more damaging than helpful			0
" a june poll by @entity137 found that more than half of @entity41 surveyed in @entity13 support an end to the embargo and a solid majority of them also favor restoring diplomatic relations with @entity70			1
the @entity145 administration has not endorsed lifting the embargo , however			1
and it can only be lifted by @entity153 and as @entity154 , director of the @entity0 - @entity155 , a lobby group in favor of keeping the embargo , points out , all seven @entity1 - @entity0 legislators , including senators @entity148 , @entity150 and @entity151 , are against doing so			2
still , the @entity1 - @entity0 community is changing			2
" the @entity1 - @entity0 community is definitely different from that of several years ago , " says professor @entity160 , director of @entity162 's @entity161			2
" it has a large number of post- 1990 immigrants who generally oppose the @entity4 regime but may want to keep the options to travel to @entity1			0
furthermore , the ' historicos ' who came to the @entity0 in the late ' 50 's and 60 's are also experiencing attrition from aging			2
" the @entity0 and @entity1 have been at odds for over 50 years			0
both sides have recently taken small steps towards a reconciliation			0
in 2011 , president @entity145 eased travel restrictions to the island for @entity0 citizens and last week , @entity1 said it would be willing to cooperate with @entity180 to help fight the @entity182 epidemic in @entity183			0
but , only time will tell if a new generation of young , engaged @entity43 voters can exert enough political heat to completely thaw a relationship frozen during the @entity189 .			0

a new generation of @entity41 is *re-thinking* the 50 year - old embargo
