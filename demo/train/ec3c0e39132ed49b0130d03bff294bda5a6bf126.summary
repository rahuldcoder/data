an @entity4 judge signed an order thursday declaring @entity6 legally dead , attorneys for her family said			1
probate judge @entity7 signed the order after an afternoon hearing in @entity11 court in @entity12			0
@entity13 was 18 when she was last seen in the early hours of may 30 , 2005 , leaving a nightclub on the @entity16 island of @entity17 with @entity18 and two other men			1
no one was charged in her disappearance , and her body has never been found			0
on wednesday , van der @entity18 -- who was detained twice in connection with @entity13 's disappearance but never charged -- confessed in a @entity27 court to murdering a 21 - year - old @entity29 woman five years after @entity13 went missing			1
@entity31 's father , @entity6 , filed a petition to declare his daughter dead in june , six years after she went to the @entity16 island with 100 classmates to celebrate their graduation from @entity37 in suburban @entity12			1
he was present at thursday 's hearing , as was his ex-wife , @entity13			2
she opposed the move to declare @entity31 dead , pointing to a lack of evidence indicating her daughter is deceased and saying in a september statement that she " will always hope and pray for @entity31 's safe return			0
" on thursday , she told reporters while leaving the courtroom that she was upset by the judge 's decision			2
" @entity31 's father wanted to see this through , and of course it makes me very sad , " said @entity13 , who now works with groups and families of missing children			1
@entity6 acknowledged thursday that the ruling is " tough , " though he said he 's considered it a possibility ever since the @entity62 told him 10 days after his daughter went missing that they were approaching her case as a homicide			2
" we 've been dealing with this death for the last six and a half years , " he told reporters thursday			2
" hopefully , this meeting today will ( provide ) some closure			0
" in a hearing in september , @entity7 ruled the petition could go forward , according to @entity73 affiliate @entity72			0
at that time , @entity7 ruled that a notice of presumption of death must be published in a local newspaper for two successive weeks , followed by a 12 - week time frame to submit any evidence the teen is still alive , @entity72 said			2
barring any such evidence , the judge would then be able to declare @entity6 dead			0
@entity6 explained that , barring his daughter miraculously being found alive , that a decision like the one issued thursday had to be issued " eventually			0
" his attorney , @entity84 , previously said that the order -- which acts as a death certificate -- will help resolve the estate of @entity6 , who still has a small college fund in her name and is listed as a participant and beneficiary on her father 's health insurance			1
now was the proper time to pursue this action , said @entity6 , given his desire to take " care of some needs " and van der @entity18 's conviction earlier this week			1
" i was in a situation where a lot of things came together , with the criminal element as well as having to take care of business , " he said			0
the 24 - year - old @entity110 national could be imprisoned for as many as 30 years when he is sentenced friday , two days after he pleaded guilty to all the charges against him in the killing of a @entity29 woman in 2010			1
investigators believe van der @entity18 killed @entity116 after she found something related to the @entity13 case on van der @entity18 's computer as she visited with him in his hotel room			1
@entity18 also faces possible extradition to the @entity123			0
in june 2010 , a federal grand jury in @entity4 indicted him on charges of wire fraud and extortion after allegations surfaced that he tried to extort $ 250,000 from @entity13 's mother			1
@entity18 offered to provide what turned out to be bogus information about the whereabouts of @entity6 's remains in exchange for the money , according to the indictment			1
he was allegedly given a total of $ 25,000 , and authorities believe he used that money to travel to @entity29 and participate in a poker tournament , where he met @entity116			0
@entity142 , a spokeswoman for the @entity123 attorney 's office for north @entity4 , said that there 's no timetable as to when federal authorities will seek to bring van der @entity18 to the @entity123 for prosecution			2
" we want @entity18 to face the charges here , and we are prepared to try him as soon as we can get him to the @entity123 , " @entity150 said			0
" right now , we do n't know when that will be			0

@entity13 's father says " a lot of things came together " making now the right time
he adds , " we 've been dealing with this death for the last *6Â½* years "
@entity6 's mother says the @entity4 judge 's ruling " makes me very sad "
the then 18 - year - old girl was last seen in @entity17 with @entity18
