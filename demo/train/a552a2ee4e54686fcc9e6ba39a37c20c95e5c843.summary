@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 has amazing stories to tell and some family members still ca n't get enough of the harrowing tales of her 33 days as a prisoner of war during the first @entity9			1
even 20 years after the start of that war , @entity10 can captivate an audience			1
she tells family friends or her daughters ' classmates about @entity18 bombs that struck close to where she was held by her @entity22 captors			2
" that was the biggest fear for me , i did n't think the @entity22 were going to kill me , but i was afraid of one of our bombs , " @entity10 tells @entity2			1
or the story of how the @entity22 soldiers spared her the worst punishment because they were convinced she was an ignorant woman			2
" i played along with it , " @entity10 says			1
" i really do n't know anything			2
i 'm just a woman			2
" but 20 years after her 33 days as a pow , @entity10 is fighting another battle : breast cancer			1
she was diagnosed five months ago and is preparing for a fourth round of chemotherapy			0
@entity10 says being a pow " helped me keep a positive outlook because i know what i can withstand			1
" " i know that i 've survived something as dangerous , if not more dangerous , so i feel like i 'm going to make it			0
" @entity10 says her doctors have removed all of the cancerous tumors for now and that she 's been given a " good " prognosis			1
the former @entity53 specialist says she rarely thinks about her days as pow , but during those 33 days , @entity10 was one of the most visible faces of the war			1
@entity10 was driving a truck on january 30 , 1991 , near the southern @entity22 border			1
after a couple of confusing wrong turns , @entity10 and another soldier riding alongside her found themselves in the middle of a firefight and surrounded by @entity22 soldiers			1
her parents , @entity68 and @entity69 , held vigil from their home outside @entity72 , @entity73			0
it was an excruciating and painful wait			0
not knowing if she was still alive , the @entity69 's received a @entity76 card that she had mailed just hours before being captured			0
" when i first heard , i just sat by the tv and just cried the whole rest of the day			0
so , it was difficult , " @entity79 says			0
but then came the 3 a.m. phone call that sent an eruption of joy through the @entity69 's home			0
a @entity2 producer called and told the family to turn on their television			0
for the first time in 33 days , the @entity69 's saw their daughter safe and alive being turned over by the @entity22 to the @entity92			1
looking back through the long lens of time , @entity10 's parents say the @entity37 experience changed their daughter in a fundamental way			1
" she 's a lot more serious about life and relationships now than what she was before , " @entity69 says			0
" everyone means more to her			0
life means more to her now			0
" now she lives a quiet life in @entity0 with her husband and two teenage daughters			0
her oldest daughter , @entity110 , wants to join the @entity53 and that 's sparked a minor tug - of - war in the family			2
@entity10 is n't comfortable with the idea , but @entity110 is n't giving up			1
the @entity115 might be an acceptable compromise			0
that 's the kind of battle @entity10 prefers these days , the struggles of raising teenagers and watching her girls prepare to venture out into the world			1
" i 'd like to be remembered for being a good mom , " @entity10 says			2
" i 'd rather be remembered for that than being a prisoner - of - war			2

now , @entity10 faces another battle : breast cancer
@entity10 : being pow " helped me keep a positive outlook "
