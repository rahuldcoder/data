-- @entity2 's leader confidently proclaimed on sunday that @entity5 leader @entity4 's days are numbered , but he could n't foresee how long the alliance 's grinding mission to protect besieged civilians will last			1
" the game is over for @entity4 , " @entity2 's secretary - general @entity9 told @entity0 's " @entity11			1
" " he should realize sooner rather than later that there 's no future for him or his regime			2
" @entity2 's @entity9 on the endgame in @entity5 @entity9 , a former @entity17 prime minister , believes @entity4 will be ushered out of power amid the " wind of change " sweeping across @entity20 and the @entity21 , and the dramatic military strides in @entity23 and @entity24			1
" this week we have seen a major blow to @entity27 and @entity29 's evil vision of conflict as a means to create conflict between the @entity34 world and the rest of the world			1
and in @entity23 , the @entity40 is under pressure everywhere , so basically i am very optimistic , " he said , making reference to the killing of @entity29 by @entity39 on monday in @entity24			0
the alliance has been carrying out a @entity44 resolution calling for the protection of civilians from the @entity4 regime by any means necessary , and since march 31 , its planes have been pounding targets across the country			1

there have been widespread assumptions among experts that the conflict between pro- and @entity72 forces will continue to be a stalemate for some time			0
@entity9 was asked when the @entity2 operation would be completed but all he could say was " it needs an end of the mission			1
" " we have defined three very clear military objectives , " he said			0
" firstly , a complete end to all attacks against civilians			2
secondly , a free and unhindered and immediate access for humanitarian assistance			0
and thirdly , a withdrawal of @entity4 military forces and paramilitary forces to their bases and barracks			0
when these objectives are fulfilled , our mission is accomplished			2
" he said " it 's hard to imagine " that the " outrageous and systematic attacks " by @entity97 forces against @entity5 will halt as along as @entity4 stays in power			1
he said there needs to be a political and not a military solution with a " peaceful transition to democracy " as @entity4 leaves power			0
but the conflict rages on			0
the @entity105 state news - agency reported on sunday that 50 people were injured when government forces and rebels clashed near the @entity105 - @entity5 border on saturday			1

meanwhile , in the de facto rebel capital , @entity118 , the @entity5 opposition said saturday that @entity119 has agreed to arm the rebels			1
@entity120 , deputy chairman of the @entity121 , said opposition representatives have flown to @entity119 to finish the deal			0
the @entity119 @entity124 categorically denied it will send weapons to @entity5			2
a press office spokesman said @entity119 will only go as far as sending non-lethal weapons such as satellite and radar systems to aid the rebels			0
