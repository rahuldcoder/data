@entity1 's president became the fourth @entity3 leader forced from power this year when he signed a deal wednesday aimed at ending his country 's months - long political crisis			1
the deal , brokered by the @entity9 and signed in @entity10 , allows @entity11 to retain the title of president for three months but requires him to hand over executive powers to @entity1 's vice president			1

it was also unclear how protesters , who have demanded that @entity11 be held accountable , would react to the agreement , which provided him with immunity from prosecution			2

" everything 's unpredictable with @entity11			2
he 's due for some health checkups , " said the official , who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the media			0
" at least for the period now , it makes sense he would stay in @entity10 for some time			0
" @entity78 secretary - general ban ki - moon said wednesday that @entity11 told him he planned to come to @entity79 for medical treatment after the deal was signed			2
last week , @entity11 told @entity83 24 television that he would leave office " within 90 days " of an agreement with the council			0

" " i know the difficulties , the negatives , the positives ; i will not hang on to power			0
whoever hangs on to power i think is crazy , " he said			0
clashes erupted in @entity1 's capital of @entity101 on wednesday , just hours after @entity11 and opposition leaders headed to @entity10 for the signing ceremony			1
the fighting between government forces and tribal fighters began after government forces attacked opposition posts , several witnesses in the area said			1
during months of violent uprisings , government troops have responded with live fire on protesters , killing many , according to medics and opposition sources			0

" the transitional government will be responsible for rebuilding the economy and will undergo dialogue with the youth movements to ensure their support and participation in the political arena , " he said			0
@entity11 's signing of the deal is the latest in a string of power shifts spurred by popular uprisings that have swept through a number of @entity3 countries since january			1

former @entity148 president @entity147 was the next to lose his grip on power , stepping down on february 11 after tens of thousands of @entity148 set up a protest camp in @entity153 's @entity152			0
last month , former @entity155 leader @entity154 was killed in his hometown of @entity157 , where he had fled after rebel fighters took control of the country 's capital			1
