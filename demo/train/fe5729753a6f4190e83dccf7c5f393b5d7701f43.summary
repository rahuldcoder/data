@entity0 has seen some ugly divorces in recent times : @entity3 and @entity4 , @entity5 and @entity6			2
now @entity7 is threatened with partition as a rebellion flares in the north and political uncertainty grips the capital , @entity13			1
@entity7 's neighbors and western governments are looking on anxiously as drug traffickers and @entity18 groups affiliated with @entity19 take advantage of the vacuum -- in a region already blighted by hunger , poverty and weak government			1
the origins of @entity7 's collapse are twofold			1
in january , @entity29 rebels began attacking towns in the vast deserts of northern @entity7			1
many had recently returned from fighting for @entity32 in @entity33 , bringing guns and vehicles with them			2
then , on march 22 , there was a coup by mid-ranking officers in @entity7 's army angry with corruption and the lack of resources for fighting the rebellion			1
a vast country of few inhabitants ( 15 million ) and searing desert , @entity7 lies at an awkward intersection in @entity0			1
to the north is a 1,200 kilometer border with @entity51 , to the east @entity52 with its own restive @entity29 minority , to the west @entity55			2
all four countries are dealing with the growing presence of @entity18 groups affiliated with @entity19			1
@entity29 revolts in @entity7 and @entity52 are nothing new			1
long marginalized , the pastoral and nomadic @entity29 have frequently taken up arms , sometimes with @entity32 's backing			2
" the @entity29 feel like the outsiders of the national economy , completely excluded from the economic resources in many regions , " says @entity63 , a professor at @entity64 in @entity65 who studies jihad in the @entity67			2
this revolt , launched by the @entity73 , or @entity73 , is more serious than previous rebellions			1
its fighters now control several important towns in the north , including @entity79 on the @entity52 and the fabled city of @entity81 , where the mayor has spoken of teenage boys strutting through the streets with @entity85			2
an area the size of @entity88 is now beyond the government 's control			2
the @entity73 has declared independence for @entity92			2
speaking to the @entity94 last week , @entity7 envoy @entity93 says : " our people are divided			1
our country is threatened with partition			2
" the vast areas involved -- and some of the most inhospitable and scorched terrain on @entity101 -- make outside intervention risky			2
@entity104 analysts say the plan by the @entity106 to deploy some 3,000 troops to reclaim areas held by the rebels may just make the situation worse			2
the @entity29 rebels are hardened fighters			2
their chief of staff , @entity112 , was a colonel in @entity33 , and several hundred other @entity29 served in @entity33 uniforms			0
professor @entity114 of the @entity115 in @entity116 says it 's difficult to know how many people the @entity73 has under arms and to separate its core force from hangers - on			0
" but who 's going to kick them out ? " he asks			0
" not the @entity7 army , and @entity106 would be very unwise to try to do any more than draw a line in the sand			1
" the @entity73 is a secular , nationalist movement opposed to @entity19			1
its @entity129 representative , @entity128 , said last week : " the biggest challenge now is n't the military , it is to get rid of @entity19			1
we need schools and the people do n't have enough food , and that is because of @entity19 making things unstable			1
" @entity19 ? really ? even seasoned observers of @entity7 and @entity140 admit that it 's difficult to unravel the links between @entity18 extremists and @entity29 factions			1
but it 's clear the militants are at least fellow travelers in this revolt			2
one @entity29 group , @entity148 , aims to establish an @entity150 state in northern @entity7 and is present in several newly " liberated " areas			1
its leader , @entity152 , has called on the people of @entity81 to wage " jihad against those who resist @entity156 " ; there are unconfirmed reports that @entity152 met three emirs of @entity140 in @entity81 on april 3			0
accounts from @entity81 in the last week say the black flag associated with @entity19 has been hoisted on pickup trucks			1
a journalist in the city , @entity165 , says @entity150 who arrived in the city are demanding the imposition of @entity156 law			0
@entity165 says on thursday that @entity148 " pretty much has control of the entire city , and is attempting to destroy all signs of @entity172 , shutting down bars that sell alcohol and harassing cigarette vendors			2
" " what they want is to cut the hands of those who commit adultery			0
... and they will no longer accept girls who are dressed in [ what they call ] a ' disastrous ' way , " @entity165 says			0
other sources say the group has attracted teenage boys to its ranks with offers of food , now in short supply in many areas			0
that has set off alarm bells in the country that once ruled @entity7			1
@entity197 foreign minister @entity196 says it " appears that this extreme @entity18 - @entity199 faction is taking the upper hand among the different @entity29 factions			0
" but the @entity73 's @entity202 said last week : " it is true that @entity148 have the black flags , but they are not @entity19			1
they want stability on the streets			0
although they want @entity156 law , they are against @entity19 , too			1
" @entity64 's @entity63 supports that assessment			0
" we ca n't make a systematic link between the @entity140 and @entity29			0
it 's completely false , " she says			0
professor @entity114 says there is another complicating factor , asserting that the @entity51 security service is highly influential among leaders such as @entity222 , with whom it has long had links , as well as with key regional leaders of @entity19 ( such as @entity226 abou @entity227 )			1
@entity114 says he believes the @entity51 see some benefit in the " specter " of @entity19 roaming the desert because it heightens their importance to the @entity232 as a partner in counterterrorism -- even as they simultaneously lead regional efforts to co-operate against extremist groups			1
@entity51 officials reject claims they have any links with @entity140			0
@entity140 's hierarchy , reach and its links with @entity29 factions may be as clear as a sandstorm , but it has certainly become more audacious in @entity7			1
intelligence sources in the region say it has makeshift camps in remote desert bordering @entity51 and @entity55			0
in november , it abducted three @entity251 from a restaurant in @entity81 , killing a @entity254 man who resisted			0
two @entity197 geologists were kidnapped the same week			0
@entity19 has threatened to kill all five if any rescue attempt is launched			1
some @entity29 leaders and military officers claim @entity19 benefited from the complicity or at least negligence of the previous civilian government , with some influential politicians allegedly profiting from the extremists ' connections to drug trafficking and ransoms paid to free western hostages			1
a stormy outlook the @entity106 has persuaded coup leader capt. @entity269 to transfer power ( if not leave the stage ) , and the speaker of @entity7 's @entity273 , @entity272 , was sworn in as interim president on thursday			1
the @entity275 has described the transition as " not ideal " but also " a very important restoration of civilian rule			0
" regional sources doubt that @entity272 can or wants to negotiate with the @entity29			0
as he took his oath of office thursday , he threatened " total war " against the rebels -- a position that appears to have the support of other west @entity0 states			0
" we prefer peace , but if war is the only way out , we will wage it , " @entity272 says , according to @entity286 in @entity13			0
for now , it seems extremely unlikely that whoever is in charge in @entity13 ( @entity272 , a newly elected president or @entity269 ) would implement past promises of autonomy and development for @entity29 areas , and reach an agreement with the @entity73 to integrate its fighters into the army			0
the @entity303 mood in @entity13 has grown visceral ; the @entity73 are unlikely to give up gains for pledges so often reneged on			0
the nightmare scenario for @entity104 governments is that without the rapid re-establishment of civilian rule , parts of northern @entity7 , southern @entity51 and @entity55 could become a safe haven for @entity19 in the same way the group has exploited power vacuums in @entity315 and @entity316			1
for ordinary @entity7 , @entity29 or not , the nightmare is very different			1
in one of the poorest countries in @entity0 , many already know hunger and insecurity			2
their situation has just become more precarious			0
nongovernmental workers in @entity13 speak of widespread looting in @entity79 , with aid groups and government offices targeted and food stores looted			0
@entity329 of @entity330 says the group 's property in @entity79 was ransacked and its vehicles stolen			0
@entity330 continues to work in two northern regions through local staff , stressing its independence from the @entity29 fighters there			0
but @entity329 says that with the onset of the dry season , child malnutrition could rise sharply			0
and an offensive against rebel - held areas would make the group 's work even more difficult			0
@entity329 estimates that the fighting has already displaced upwards of 10,000 people			0
his words were echoed thursday by @entity351 human rights commissioner @entity350 , who warned that @entity7 " may soon be plunged into a devastating food crisis with a risk of other shortages , including medical supplies , if the insurrections and insecurity persist			1

@entity7 is one of poorest nations in the world
the latest revolt is more serious than previous rebellions
outsiders worry a power vacuum will allow @entity19 affiliates to take control
