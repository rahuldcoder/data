-- in @entity2 's adaptation of @entity4 's 2008 graphic novel , " @entity6 , " as played by @entity5 , is a world - weary mercenary who allows others to believe — and perhaps embellish — his heroic tales			1
travelling with a @entity14 - style band of warriors who are lured by riches to defend the beleaguered kingdom of @entity18 ( @entity19 ) , the mighty man is still haunted by nightmares of the three - headed @entity21 , and he mourns the murder of his wife and children — though there are those who whisper that he himself killed them			0
when @entity5 is wearing the head of the slayed @entity31 lion in battle , walloping enemies with his tree - trunk sized club , and heaving charging horses to the ground with remarkable ease , he 's in his rock comfort zone			1
but as a tortured hero hampered by self - doubt , @entity5 labors			1
he 's aiming for the gravitas of @entity43 in " gladiator " and @entity45 in " 300 , " but he races through the moments where @entity6 has to be vulnerable or jaded			0
and since he 's the lone person in @entity49 — a city - state populated by @entity51 , @entity52 , and @entity53 — who did n't go to @entity56 boarding school , his careful enunciation sounds especially out of place			0
" @entity6 " might seem like the perfect role for @entity5 , but the movie really needs a better @entity5			2
