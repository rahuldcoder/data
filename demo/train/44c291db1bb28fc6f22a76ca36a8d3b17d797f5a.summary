@entity0 -- a new policy sets guidelines for how long @entity5 border officials can hold computers and downloaded information seized at checkpoints , and with whom they can share that information			2
new rules announced thursday specify border searches to be conducted " as expeditiously as possible			1
" the policy , announced thursday by @entity15 secretary @entity14 , continues to give border officials the authority to search files in travelers ' laptop computers , mobile phones , @entity21 and similar devices with or without suspicion that a crime has occurred			1
that is in keeping with long - standing court rulings that say the federal government 's powers of search and seizure are greatest at the border to protect the country			0
but the new policy also attempts to address complaints from travelers that border officials are needlessly perusing confidential information , downloading it and keeping devices and information indefinitely without any explanation			1
the policy gives travelers the right to be " present in the room " during searches , although they are " not necessarily ... permitted to witness the search itself			1
" it says searches should be conducted " as expeditiously as possible			2
" and @entity48 officers should keep devices no longer than five days unless there are " extenuating circumstances			0
" officers with @entity53 , the investigative branch of the @entity15 , can keep devices up to 30 days			1
it also requires border officers to document searches and conduct them in the presence of a supervisor			2
and it says they should take steps to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of information and share it only with federal agencies " that have mechanisms in place to protect " the data			0
border officers have long had to deal with issues pitting privacy versus security			2
but with the proliferation of laptop computers , travelers increasingly are traveling with sensitive information , including confidential legal documents , medical records , credit card and bank information and trade secrets			2
" keeping @entity5 safe in an increasingly digital world depends on our ability to lawfully screen materials entering the @entity5 , " @entity82 said in a written statement			0
" the new directives ... strike the balance between respecting the civil liberties and privacy of all travelers while ensuring @entity15 can take the lawful actions necessary to secure our borders			1
" the @entity95 said the new rules are a " welcome first step , " but said they do not go far enough			0
" there are two key aspects of this new policy worth applauding -- the limitations on the time that electronic devices can be held by customs officers and requirements that information from electronic devices only be retained if there is probable cause that a crime has been committed , " said @entity95 attorney @entity98			0
" these procedural safeguards recognize that the old system was invasive and harmed many innocent travelers			0
" " but unless and until the government requires agents to have individualized suspicion before reviewing such sensitive information as medical records , legal papers and financial information , even the most elaborate procedural safeguards will be insufficient , " he said			0
the @entity95 this week filed suit seeking records about the @entity48 's policy of searching travelers ' laptops			1
the @entity15 's statement said its new policies " enhance transparency , accountability and oversight of electronic media searches at @entity5 ports of entry			1
" " searches of electronic media ... are vital to detecting information that poses serious harm to the @entity5 , including terrorist plans , or constitutes criminal activity -- such as possession of child pornography and trademark or copyright infringement , " the statement said			0
the department said it searches electronic media " on a small percentage of international travelers			1
" the border protection agency said that between october 1 , 2008 , and august 11 , it conducted about 1,000 laptop searches while processing more than 221 million travelers at @entity5 ports of entry			1
just 46 searches were in depth , it said .			0
