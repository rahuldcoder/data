seventy years ago , on february 23 , two @entity1 flags were planted on the peak of @entity4 , located on the @entity6 island of @entity7			1
coming five days into one of the most ferocious battles of @entity10 , the first flag - raising , by a group of @entity13 , was emotional , and a @entity13 photographer captured it			1
but a @entity1 commander thought the flag was too small to be seen at a distance			2
and so , a few hours later , five more @entity13 and one @entity20 medical corpsman carried out orders to haul a much larger flag up to the top			2
again photos were shot , along with a film			2
no one thought to record this bit of everyday war business in the daily log			2
how did this second flag - raising , and not the other , come to stand not only for the heroism shown during the @entity32 , but the core values of the @entity13 , and indeed of all @entity1 combatants in @entity10 ? the answer is found in the power of certain images , in this case a photograph taken by @entity40 photographer @entity39 , to capture a moment but also transcend it			1
it might be hard today to comprehend how a single image can become iconic , exposed as we are to streams of photographs and videos every day from our news and social media feeds			2
but @entity39 's image resonated with all who saw it and was swiftly reproduced on @entity1 government stamps and posters , in sandstone ( on @entity7 , by the @entity57 ) and most famously in bronze , as the @entity59 in @entity60			1
the photograph won a @entity62 in 1945 and is considered one of the most famous images of all time			0
news : the inside story of the famous @entity7 photo why this photograph , and not the one of the arguably more meaningful first flag placement , which was taken by staff sgt. @entity71 ? its dynamic and masterful composition is part of the secret			1
the flag structures the picture , its diagonal back - leaning position contrasting with the forward motion of the soldiers			1
they seem to rise out of the ash and other detritus of the battlefield , and there is already something sculptural in their massed bodies , in their muscular legs and arms that strain to hoist up the heavy pole			0
the leg of the lead bearer crosses the flagpole , adding a further sense of solidity			0
there is something deeply reassuring about this photograph in its display of strength and teamwork -- even the last man , who can no longer touch the flagpole , " has the back " of his comrades -- and its communication of a push forward to victory			0
the fact we can not see their faces also works to lift the image out of its original context , lending it a universal quality			0
in @entity71 's photograph , instead , the eye goes to the face of the wary sentinel , who guards the men who have almost completed their installation			0
the flag flies free and proud , and all of the soldiers are engaged intently in their task , but they are scattered around the frame			2
there is no one visual " sweet spot " in this image ; it would certainly be harder to reproduce as sculpture			0
the gun pointed outward reminds the viewer that this is a very dangerous mission			0
this photo does not reassure us , but rather makes us watchful			2
ironically , this picture of a historic moment of planting an @entity1 flag on @entity6 soil conveys the everyday jobs of war -- guarding , standing around -- while @entity39 's , of a routine flag substitution , communicates an exceptional and heroic moment			1
in truth , both images are necessary to convey the experience of @entity7 , which stands today as a notable case of daring strategies of amphibious assault ( @entity1 ) and static defense ( @entity6 ) , examples of tenacity and teamwork , as well as failures of intelligence and devastating losses ( on both sides )			1
what made @entity7 such a terrible battleground , even within the context of the many tough campaigns of the @entity168 ? its primary strategic importance for the @entity1 was as an airbase and staging area for assaults on @entity174 , while the 8.5 - square - mile island took on symbolic as well as strategic meaning for the @entity6 as the first national soil to face foreign invasion			1
the violence of this battle reflected the high motivation of most combatants , but also the particular circumstances of the island			0
under the leadership of lt. gen. @entity186 , the @entity6 prepared an extraordinary underground network of tunnels and caves in the semisoft sandstone , from which they would wage their war			0
when the @entity1 landed , @entity186 allowed them to advance onto the beach , then opened fire ; then , as the @entity6 were firebombed out of their hiding places , the beach and environs became a dense killing field , , with hand - to - hand combat not uncommon			0
the intensity of battle on @entity7 epitomized what author @entity202 called " the kill or be killed nature of combat in the @entity206			1
" for over a month , both sides endured , and saw , terrible things hourly , and yet their resolve only strengthened			0
the @entity6 endured inhuman conditions underground , without food , water , and medical supplies , and their no - surrender policy created more unburied corpses in the tunnels as the war went on			1
the @entity1 endured their own hell above ground , and the chaos of combat in a constrained space made friendly fire casualties higher than usual			0
of approximately 20,000 @entity6 soldiers , only about 2,000 survived the battle , while the @entity1 had over 20,000 casualties and 7,000 dead out of a total mobilized force of 70,000			0
@entity32 took an especially large toll on the @entity13			0
one - third of the 19,000 who died during @entity10 perished on the island			0
it is the very brutality of @entity7 that made @entity39 's polished photograph so necessary and appealing			1
there is something @entity236 about the image on top of the mountain , as opposed to the @entity6 in their caves and the @entity1 their targets on the beach			0
the subsequent death of three of the flag - raisers in battle only made the photo more compelling as a representation of heroism on the island and as an abstract homage to camaraderie , strength , and determination in battle in general			1
it is this perfection that contributed to the unfounded suspicion that @entity39 's picture had been staged , and a campaign to restore @entity71 's photo and the first flag - raisers to greater prominence			1
by then , the picture had been enshrined in the image bank relating to @entity7 and had taken on a life of its own , reproduced in sand , ice , and even @entity268			1
on this anniversary , we might remember both photos , for together they remind us that war is also waged , and won , in the small moments of mundane labor , in obscure airstrips and staging areas as well as major battlegrounds , and in the steady gaze and aim of the single sentinel			2
the two flags of @entity7 offer a lesson for today about the power of the media to shape our notions of what , and who , deserves to be remembered about war .			1
