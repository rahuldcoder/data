-- on sunday a missile launched from a @entity3 drone struck a house in @entity6 's remote tribal agency of @entity7 , killing eight suspected militants , most of whom were loyal to the @entity6 @entity12 commander , @entity11			1
@entity11 has reportedly overseen multiple attacks against @entity15 troops in @entity16			0
while the @entity20 drone war against @entity21 in @entity6 is well known and is even , on occasion , publicly acknowledged by senior @entity24 administration officials , the strike against @entity11 's fighters is part of a lesser - known campaign to target @entity6 militants , who are less able to pose a threat to the @entity3 homeland			1
this represents an expansion of the drone program that was overseen by president @entity24 's administration			1
in 2004 president @entity34 authorized for the first time the covert lethal use of drones inside @entity6 territory			1
during his tenure , there were 45 drone strikes in @entity6 's @entity41 ( @entity41 ) , according to data compiled by the @entity43			2
but when president @entity24 took office in january 2009 , the program ramped up quickly , accelerating from an average of one strike every 40 days to one every four days by mid- 2011			1
the @entity43 maintains a database of every reported drone strike in @entity6 's tribal regions since 2004			1
we monitor reports about the strikes from reliable @entity56 and @entity6 news sources , such as the @entity57 , the @entity58 , @entity0 , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , and @entity62			2
all told , the 307 drone strikes launched by the @entity3 in @entity6 between june 2004 and june 2012 have killed an estimated 1,562 to 2,377 suspected militants , according to news accounts			1
@entity6 to open supply routes into @entity16 of those strikes , 70 % have struck @entity7 , home to factions of the @entity6 @entity12 and the @entity69 , which has often launched operations in @entity71 against civilian targets			0
over a third of these strikes have reportedly targeted members of the @entity12 , with at least 10 of the strikes killing senior @entity12 commanders , as well as hundreds of lower - level fighters			0
the @entity3 ' aggressive drone campaign in @entity6 slowed considerably in 2011			0
there were 70 drone strikes in the tribal regions that year , down from 118 in 2010 , which saw the peak number of strikes since the program began			0
according to our data , 6 % of the fatalities resulting from drone strikes in 2011 were civilians , up 1 percentage point from the figure in 2010			0
over the life of the program we estimate that the civilian casualty rate is 16 %			0
clearly , as the years have progressed , the drone strikes have become more precise and discriminating			0
in march 2011 , @entity6 maj. gen. @entity97 acknowledged this when he said " the number of innocent people being killed is relatively low " and that " most of the targets are hard - core militants , " the first such public acknowledgment by a senior @entity6 military officer			1
similarly , president @entity24 made his first public comments about the covert drone program , when he told participants of a google+ " hangout " on january 30 , 2012 , that the @entity3 only conducts " very precise precision strikes against @entity21 and their affiliates , and we 're very careful in terms of how it 's been applied			1
" even if it is the case that there are relatively few civilians killed in the strikes , the drone program is quite unpopular in @entity6			1
during the summer of 2010 the @entity43 sponsored one of the few public opinion polls ever to be conducted in @entity6 's @entity41 and found that almost 90 % of the respondents opposed @entity3 military operations in the region			2
the wider @entity6 public shares this sentiment : a june 2012 @entity127 poll found that about three quarters of @entity6 consider the drone campaign to be unnecessary			0
opinion : @entity24 ramps up covert war in @entity132 even so , the strikes may have contributed to a relative decrease in violence across @entity6			1
there were 41 suicide attacks in @entity6 in 2011 , down from 49 in 2010 and a record high of 87 in 2009			2
the 118 drone strikes carried out in 2010 coincided with an almost 50 % drop in suicide attacks across @entity6 , according to the @entity142 , which monitors @entity6 militant groups			2
( another factor in the reduction in terrorism in @entity6 surely was the @entity6 military 's own operations against the @entity12 , particularly its 2009 campaigns in @entity150 and @entity151			1
some 1,600 @entity12 fighters were killed during " @entity153 " in @entity150 while hundreds more surrendered to the government			0
) evidence of the drone strikes ' impact can be found in the description provided by @entity159 , the former @entity57 reporter held by the @entity12 @entity69 for months in 2009 , who called the drones " a terrifying presence " in @entity151			0
officials : @entity3 may repay @entity6 key militant commanders reportedly started sleeping outside under trees to avoid being targeted , while @entity12 militants regularly executed suspected " spies " in @entity7 accused of providing information to the @entity3 , suggesting they feared betrayal from within			2
last month , a top @entity12 commander in @entity151 halted all polio eradication efforts in the area for fear that the health workers were , in fact , @entity3 spies in disguise assisting the @entity20 drone program			0
the @entity20 drone attacks in @entity6 have undoubtedly hindered some of the @entity12 's operations , killed hundreds of their low - level fighters , and a number of their top commanders			1
but they have also slowed considerably since their peak in 2010 , and have come under harsher scrutiny both in @entity6 and the @entity187 , rendering the program 's future in the region uncertain			2
the @entity20 strikes may also be fueling terrorism			0
@entity193 , an @entity3 citizen of @entity6 descent trained by the @entity6 @entity12 , tried to detonate a car bomb in @entity196 on may 1 , 2010			0
the plot failed , but @entity193 subsequently claimed that the drone program had fueled his anger against the @entity3			0
* here is a list of the @entity12 leaders who have been killed in the @entity20 drone campaign , according to data compiled by the @entity43 from reliable news reports : june 18 , 2004 : @entity206 , @entity12 leader august 13 , 2008 : @entity207 , @entity12 commander in @entity151 october 26 , 2008 : @entity208 , close associate of @entity206 august 5 , 2009 : @entity209 , overall leader of the @entity6 @entity12 december 31 , 2009 : @entity210 , a key @entity12 commander in @entity7 january 2010 ( exact date unknown ) : @entity212 , @entity213 @entity12 commander february 24 , 2010 : @entity214 , @entity12 commander wanted in connection with a bombing in @entity217 in 2006 december 17 , 2010 : @entity218 , @entity12 commander in @entity150 october 27 , 2011 : @entity219 , deputy of @entity12 commander @entity220 march 13 , 2012 : @entity221 and @entity222 , two of @entity220 's senior commanders read more about nation and global security at @entity0 's @entity227 blog .			1

@entity229 , @entity230 : @entity231 *quietly* targeting militants in @entity6 with drones
they say attacks spiked on @entity24 's watch , from one every 40 days , to one every 4 days
they say since 2004 1,562 to 2,377 suspected militants killed ; but program decried in @entity6
writers : program seems *effective* , but anger over it may fuel terrorism
