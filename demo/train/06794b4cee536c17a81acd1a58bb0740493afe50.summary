-- they were miraculous escape shots even the late , great @entity2 would have been proud of			2
twice during sudden death on the extra playoff holes of a titanic @entity8 final , @entity5 @entity4 looked as if he were about to hand the trophy to his opponent on a plate			1
and twice @entity13 's @entity12 could only smile and shake his head as @entity4 channeled the spirit of @entity17 's golfing maverick to extricate himself from the bushes of the @entity20 desert			1
but the 23 - year - old 's luck could n't hold and finally , on the fifth extra hole , @entity12 sealed the biggest victory of his career to date			1
" at that time , you 're just thinking , ' do i need to just hand him the trophy now after those two shots ? ' " @entity12 told the tournament 's official website of @entity4 's second ridiculous escape shot			1
" i kept shaking my head because there was a couple of times there where i thought he was absolutely dead -- the tournament was mine , " @entity12 said			2
but he should have known better			0
@entity4 took care of @entity41 's @entity40 in the semifinal , played early on sunday , and went into the final aiming to become the first @entity5 to win a @entity45 title			1
day , who toppled @entity48 's @entity47 in his semi , was three up after nine holes before his @entity5 opponent started clawing his way back into the final and made a vital downhill putt on the 17th to reduce the gap to just one			1
needing to win the final hole to force sudden death @entity4 held his nerve to make a short putt after an exquisite shot from a greenside bunker			1
then the fireworks truly began			0
having flown his approach shot over the back of the first extra hole , his ball landed in cacti bushes and looked to be unplayable			1
but @entity4 hovered above the foliage before pulling off a miraculous shot that dribbled to within four feet of the hole , to extend the match			1
at the next hole @entity4 again missed the green , his ball resting against the root of a small bush			1
once again he dazzled the gallery with an improvised shot that allowed him to halve the hole			0
" i walked over there and it was in a tree , a flower tree of some sort , in this little crevice			0
i mean , it looked absolutely dead , " @entity12 said			2
" i 'm like , ' yes			0
' i hit 8 - iron into 20 feet			0
there was so much pressure on him			0
and he does it again			0
" " those two shots were amazing , " @entity4 said			1
" i just played it like i had nothing to lose			0
" his fellow professionals agreed , 2010 @entity98 winner @entity97 saying they were two of the best escape shots he 'd ever seen , while @entity2 ' son @entity100 , called @entity4 his " new hero			2
" finally , at the fifth extra hole and with light in the @entity20 desert fading , @entity4 succumbed , missing a long putt for birdie , as @entity12 sank his from three feet			1
" @entity107 , man , he has a lot of guts , " @entity12 said			1
" he has a great short game -- straight out of the cactus twice			0
for a 23 - year - old kid , he 's got a lot of game			2
we 're going to see a lot of him for years to come			0
" the biggest thing was , ' how much do i want to win ? " i kept saying that to myself			2
last night , i kept visualizing myself with the trophy			0
i 'm glad i could finish it off			0
but it was a close one			0
" day pocketed a cool $ 1.53 million for his victory and , remarkably , never trailed once during the final 53 holes he played in the tournament			2
" i 'm disappointed because i made some terrible shots , " @entity4 said after his defeat , adding of those two @entity2 - like escapes : " those two shots were amazing , " @entity4 said			2
" i just played it like i had nothing to lose			0
" the third place playoff , also required sudden death to settle the outcome -- @entity47 defeating @entity40 on the first extra hole .			1
