@entity0 -- @entity3 's fall from power a year ago stunned the world -- three decades of iron - clad rule ended in 17 days by an unexpected groundswell of popular protests			2
a banner headline in the @entity11 newspaper said : " the people have toppled the regime			2
" but in the year that followed , @entity14 increasingly realized that what they ousted was one man , not the military that stood behind him			1
and they grew bitterly frustrated at what they perceive as the slow pace of change			0
saturday brought another reminder of the powers that be in @entity14 as @entity25 's top military officer was in @entity0 to meet with his @entity14 counterparts			1
on the table for discussion was the fate of 16 @entity25 who are among 43 foreigners working for civil society institutions who are to be tried in @entity14 for receiving illegal foreign funding			1
and possibly the fate of @entity25 military aid , conditioned now on the progress of @entity14 's transition to democracy			1
the @entity25 viewed the legal proceedings against the foreigners as a crackdown , another sign that autocracy has hardly departed @entity14			1
many @entity14 would probably agree			1
on the first anniversary of @entity3 's departure , the plan was to voice their frustration , though saturday came and went without the ceremony that was anticipated on such a day			1
activists kicked off a general strike , hoping for the kind of large protests that made @entity54 a familiar name			1
but the demonstrations were scattered and light			0
" a year later , nothing has changed			0
we have been facing the same regime , if worse , " prominent activist @entity59 told @entity1 on saturday			2
@entity59 said farmers , students and workers will help " settle this revolution once and for all			0
" " many people ... do n't know what actually toppled @entity3 was the last three days of those 17 days when large numbers of workers in different sectors went on strike , " she said from @entity0			1
the @entity72 , comprised of democratic and secular political groups , called for the immediate dismantling of the interim government and immediate presidential elections			0
it also demanded the dismissal of the prosecutor general , and a purge and overhaul of the @entity82 that came to be despised during last year 's revolt and again last week as anger mounted over a deadly stampede at a soccer match			1
the alliance said a committee should be formed to to investigate any crimes by @entity14 's new rulers while revolutionary tribunals should try former regime figures			1
meanwhile saturday , an @entity25 student was arrested with an @entity97 journalist and their female translator in the city of @entity101 , north of @entity0 , for inciting people to join the general strike and handing them money for doing so , a spokesman for the @entity14 @entity94 told @entity1			1
spokesman @entity106 said they were transferred to a general prosecutor for an investigation			0
an official spokesman for the @entity25 @entity111 said it was in touch with the male student			1
the arrests came as @entity116 decried what it called a disturbing assault on free expression			0
" violations of the right to freedom of expression have included military trials of protesters and bloggers , interrogations of journalists and activists for criticizing the military , the suspension of new satellite television licenses , and the closure of an outlet of @entity137 television , " the global monitoring group said			2
it cited cases of notable people who have " faced charges of insulting religion under vague and arbitrary laws dating from the @entity3 administration			0
" and another case in which a pro-democracy activist was sentenced to a year behind bars for handing out leaflets			0
" actions like these were hallmarks of @entity3 's 30 - year rule , but they also have been used repeatedly in the year since the ( @entity154 ) assumed control , " @entity116 said			0
the revolutionaries ' alliance , however , was not deterred			0
the next step , said member @entity159 , will be civil disobedience			0
do n't pay taxes or government bills			0
the armed forces council came down hard on the strike , saying it " serves those interests of parties aiming for the destruction of @entity14 and is a tool brought to @entity14 from abroad			1
" council leaders lt. gen @entity169 and field marshal @entity171 , meanwhile , sat down for talks with @entity173 , @entity25 gen. @entity174			2
@entity174 's spokesman , col. @entity175 , said they discussed a wide range of issues , including the investigation of nongovernmental organizations in the country and an announcement that 43 foreigners working for such groups , including 16 @entity25 , would face prosecution			1
@entity14 authorities carried out 17 raids on the offices of 10 organizations , including the @entity25 - based @entity190 , @entity191 and the @entity192			1
among those going to court is @entity195 , the son of @entity25 transportation secretary @entity196			2
the @entity14 said the pro-democracy organizations had received illegal foreign financing and were operating without a proper license			2
but some of the groups had been tacitly operating for some time in @entity14 without permission , even under @entity3			2
@entity203 threatened to cut off the $ 1.3 billion in military assistance it gives @entity14 every year			1
in doing so , the @entity25 escalated the crisis that is now testing its alliance with its @entity209 ally			2
@entity175 gave no details of the meetings			0
outside , unease reigned on the streets of @entity0 and beyond			0
the @entity14 served as role models for their @entity216 neighbors			2
they look now to a @entity217 in flames and flickers of discontent elsewhere and can take heart that they played a role in inspiring people to stand up for freedom			0
but a year since their own revolution was declared victorious , the euphoria has dimmed			0
the general strike is open ended			1
more may take to the streets sunday , which unlike saturday is a working day in the @entity232 world			0
organizers have not given up hope			0
they are optimistic that momentum will build as long as a military regime rules @entity14			1
@entity1 's @entity237 and journalist @entity238 contributed to this report .			0
