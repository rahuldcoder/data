four years after @entity2 's presidency ended in the ashes of his @entity5 pardon of @entity6 , he vaulted back onto center stage at his party 's 1980 national convention			1
it started as a buzz on the floor of the @entity13 on @entity15 's newly renovated riverfront -- talk of a @entity18 " dream ticket " to take on president @entity19			1
the intriguing scenario would pair @entity18 primary victor @entity21 and for what would have been the first time in history , a former president as his running mate			1
it became a roar when @entity29 granted an interview to @entity32 ' @entity31 to acknowledge that discussions were taking place			0
" this was supposed to be a very ho - hum convention , " recalled @entity35 , who co-anchored @entity37 's inaugural convention coverage just six weeks after the launch of the 24 - hour news network , working " up in the rafters with a couple of pieces of plywood over chairs for myself and @entity46			1
" but it turned into " a very brokered affair , " @entity35 said , " with @entity21 and @entity2 flirting with the idea of a shared presidency			1
" @entity53 to be in @entity54 during @entity55 the actual discussions involved close aides to the two men , including former @entity29 administration officials who a close @entity29 friend believes were trying to advance their own agendas			2
" if i remember correctly , @entity2 came up to me earlier that day and told me that he was into these discussions , but he did n't think they were going anywhere , " @entity62 , @entity63 's @entity18 national committeeman at the convention , said in a recent telephone interview			2
all the media attention that day was focused on the role @entity29 might play in a @entity21 @entity70 , with major responsibilities over foreign policy and fiscal issues , and the possibility of top @entity76 positions for such @entity29 administration luminaries as @entity78 and @entity79			0
@entity62 , a business owner in his district befriended by @entity29 during his early years in @entity81 , never actually worked for @entity29 but later served as @entity83 ambassador to @entity84 , appointed by the man @entity21 chose for vice president that very night -- @entity87			2
@entity21 makes surprise , post-midnight announcement @entity87 's selection was hastily arranged after the talks with @entity29 broke down			1
the pick was announced by @entity21 in a surprise post-midnight appearance at the convention hall a night earlier than scheduled with @entity87 watching on tv from his room across the street at the @entity97			2
by all accounts , it happened in a matter of minutes after @entity87 agreed during a short phone call to disavow his pro-choice posture on abortion and his condemnation of what he had branded " voodoo economics			2
" @entity21 told the convention that @entity87 had endorsed his @entity18 platform planks calling for a constitutional ban against abortion and advancing the principles of " supply - side economics " that still guide the party today			1
poll : ahead of @entity18 convention , presidential race in dead heat @entity62 never bought into the idea of a @entity21 - @entity29 ticket for a simple reason overlooked by most observers at the time -- both men then lived in @entity124 " and one of them would have had to move			1
" the @entity127 bars each state 's representatives to the @entity131 electors from voting for a ballot in which both candidates are from their state			0
in other words , a @entity21 - @entity29 ticket would have forced @entity124 's electors to vote @entity138 , whatever the popular vote			1
he did not believe either man would have been willing to change his primary residence , as @entity29 's onetime chief of staff @entity142 did when he moved back to @entity143 from @entity144 to become @entity146 's running mate 20 years later and perhaps the most influential vice president in modern history			1
@entity35 , now retired , has covered 14 political conventions dating to 1968 when @entity18 nominated @entity6 in @entity150 at what @entity35 called the first convention " perfectly scripted for tv			1
" he also was in @entity154 for that year 's @entity155 , disrupted by anti-vietnam war street protests , a vicious police response and a party division over the war that was a big factor in @entity161 's november defeat by @entity6			0
today 's conventions tend to be even more scripted than @entity6 's @entity18 gathering in 1968 , but @entity35 says " occasionally the curtains part and you get a chance to see the real rawness of politics and the fight for power			1
" in convention speeches , history is made he said journalists should avoid any preconceived attitude that conventions are non-events			0
" a reporter who goes to a convention with the notion that these are meaningless -- the days of smoke - filled rooms are over -- is the reporter who is ill - equipped for the job , " @entity35 said			2
drama at both conventions in 1980 in 1980 , there were two good examples of that -- and i had the privilege of covering both the @entity18 in @entity15 and the once - again divided @entity138 at @entity190 's @entity189 , the first of seven political conventions i 've worked at as a newsman			1
for the @entity138 , it was the year that @entity195 refused to give up after losing to a sitting president in his party 's primaries and pursuing a challenge of delegate rules until just before a scheduled floor vote for the nomination			1
in a stirring concession speech , he gave a passing tip of the hat to @entity19 -- " i congratulate president @entity19 on his victory here " -- and then brought the delegates to their feet when he bowed out of the race by saying : " for me , a few hours ago , this campaign came to an end			1
for all those whose cares have been our concern , the work goes on , the cause endures , the hope still lives and the dream will never die			0
" @entity222 expected to kick off @entity18 convention then , after @entity19 's acceptance speech , the moment we had all been waiting for -- the traditional embrace of the nominee and challenger , a moment that never came			1
@entity195 climbed back up the podium , and with the crowd cheering his every movement , twirled around the stage shaking hands with party dignitaries , their spouses , the first lady and finally the president -- an awkward looking gesture that was over in the blink of an eye			2
" this is a schizophrenic convention , " @entity243 told @entity37 's audience			0
" they nominated mr. @entity19 and they gave their love to mr. @entity195			1
they have given their votes to one and their hearts to another			0
" the senator then quickly exited , only to return for another quick handshake and pat on the shoulder for the president at a moment the two men had the stage mostly to themselves			0
" there 's no embrace , " @entity46 said			0
" no holding of hands , no v for victory , " @entity35 added			0
in november , the @entity21 - @entity87 ticket won in an electoral landslide			2
@entity19 was handicapped by his divided party , high inflation and rising interest rates , and a hostage crisis in @entity271 that dragged on until the moment @entity21 was sworn in as his successor			0
agencies warn of possible anarchist activity at conventions @entity87 presents @entity276 in dramatic fashion after eight years in office , @entity87 became the party 's presidential nominee and presented his running mate to @entity18 delegates in @entity283 in dramatic fashion , arriving near the convention site on a riverboat that also was transporting a clueless traveling press			1
" we did n't know who it was going to be , " recalled @entity287 , who covered that convention as a columnist for the @entity290 after serving as chief of staff for @entity292 , @entity63 's @entity18 governor in 1980			1
there were several big name possibilities , including rep. @entity298 , father of " supply side " economics and mentor for @entity303 's running mate , @entity304			1
sen. @entity305 of @entity306 , a future presidential nominee , and his wife , @entity308 , transportation secretary for much of @entity21 's presidency were other names mentioned			0
way down on the list -- a name i had first noticed in a @entity316 " veepstakes " story that morning or the day before -- was a little known senator from @entity319 , @entity276 , a baby - faced baby boomer who , at 41 , was even younger than @entity304			1
his selection on day 2 of the convention may even have been a surprise to him			0
he got the word from @entity87 only a short time before the announcement , and hurried over to the riverfront for a rally with @entity87 and their cheering supporters			0
" it 's not a lark , it 's @entity276 , " local tv reporter @entity334 , now a @entity37 correspondent , told viewers of @entity337 in @entity338 , @entity339 , announcing the news in a live shot just " 100 feet from where @entity276 was standing			2
" " it was still the @entity344 days , and the viewers were learning it from me , " he says now with a laugh			0
politics , parties keep some away from conventions a less - than - stellar debut for a rising star the @entity353 ticket triumphed in november over another former @entity355 governor , @entity354 , and sen. @entity356 of @entity144 , who had been chosen at their party 's convention in @entity360 now remembered mostly for the nearly disastrous debut performance of a rising @entity138 star , 41 - year - old @entity363 gov. @entity362			1
@entity362 , who already had a reputation as a spellbinding orator , was picked to place @entity354 ' name in nomination a night after a rousing @entity369 address party officials feared would steal the thunder from @entity354 , the political embodiment of laid back			0
but @entity362 went on so long -- more than 33 minutes , nearly twice his allotted time -- the clearly annoyed delegates were squirming in their seats , some even booing			0
as the young governor uttered the words , " in closing ... , " the hall erupted in boisterous cheers			0
just four years later , it was @entity362 who was getting nominated , and later elected , depriving the senior @entity87 of a second term			2
this year he will return to his 1988 role , delivering the nominating speech in @entity386 , @entity387 , for @entity389 's bid for re-election			0
" this party loves @entity362 , " said @entity391 , state @entity138 chairman in @entity63 for the past 17 years who will attend this year 's convention as a " super-delegate			2
" after all these years , still " @entity362			0
" memorable convention moments ( editors note : @entity399 has covered presidential politics off and on since the 1972 elections , including seven national party conventions over a 20 - year period for @entity404 and @entity37			0

1980 conventions were dramatic occasions for both @entity138 and @entity18
1980 @entity55 was supposed to be " ho - hum " but turned into a " very brokered affair "
1980 @entity412 was " schizophrenic " -- @entity138 nominated @entity19 and gave their love to @entity195
1988 @entity55 drama came when little - known sen. @entity276 was announced as @entity87 's running mate
