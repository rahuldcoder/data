-- once again , @entity1 has violated an important international agreement by launching a long - range missile			1
and like many times before , there is not much @entity5 or anyone else can do about it			0
the brazen defiance of the @entity1 regime is stunning			1
it 's a performance that carries a strong message for the @entity12 and regimes that are contemplating the possibility of starting nuclear programs of their own			2
it may be tempting to dismiss the importance of the launch since the rocket failed to go into orbit and disintegrated after liftoff			2
but @entity1 succeeded in defying the world and managed to carry out an important test of its missile program			1
those who are paying attention to the unfolding drama in the @entity29 include the leaders of @entity31 and those trying to stop @entity31 's nuclear ambition			1
@entity35 's decision comes at a time when the @entity12 is preparing for new talks with @entity31			1
at the end of february , @entity1 made an agreement with @entity5 to stop all missile tests and uranium enrichment in exchange for the @entity43 to deliver 240,000 tons of food			1
( while the regime can not feed its people , the budget for new launching pads , rockets and a huge military has not run out			0
) now @entity35 has broken its word			0
it is claiming that launching a satellite into space is not a military test , so it does not violate the international agreement ; rather , the event was meant to mark the 100th anniversary of the birth of its founder and " eternal president , " @entity62			0
but that explanation persuades no one			0
the @entity43 and its allies warned @entity1 to stop the launch , saying plainly , " do n't do it			1
" president @entity70 , in a thinly veiled message to @entity35 and also to @entity69 , warned that " treaties are binding			0
and violations will have consequences			0
" it 's not clear what those consequences might be			2
the @entity43 says it will not deliver the food aid agreed to in february , but that further punishes a population living in misery			2
the true consequences of obtaining nuclear weapons , as @entity1 has done , are becoming increasingly clear			1
the @entity1 dictatorship may just be the most brutal regime on earth , imprisoning , starving and isolating its people			2
despite its self - acknowledged " responsibility to protect " victims of state power , the rest of the world tiptoes around the atrocities , afraid to provoke the unpredictable regime because it has a nuclear arsenal			1
what the latest missile launch may be is a propaganda campaign , a show of force to consolidate power by @entity101 , who took power in december after the death of his father , @entity104			0
the @entity105 have ruled @entity1 since its founding after @entity107 since @entity1 tested its first nuclear weapon in 2006 , the country has become more of a threat to the region and the world			1
it has used extortion , manipulation and intimidation against its neighbors and against the @entity43			2
it has killed , kidnapped and terrorized those in neighboring countries			0
and it has become a provider of nuclear technology to dangerous regimes			2
in may 2010 , it fired a torpedo that sank a @entity124 submarine , killing 46 sailors			0
@entity124 , a strong ally of the @entity43 , responded with a trade embargo			2
six month later , the residents of the small @entity124 island of @entity130 fled in terror as the @entity132 fired 130 artillery shells			0
the attack killed no one but caused widespread panic			0
@entity1 's nuclear and missile tests have also put @entity139 on edge more than once			1
today , @entity139 seems like it is preparing for war as it awaits the latest missile launch			0
and according to a leaked report from the @entity144 , @entity1 has become a supplier to the nuclear programs of @entity31 , @entity147 and @entity148			1
in 2008 , videos of @entity1 workers inside a mysterious plant in @entity147 added to suspicions and helped convince @entity153 that @entity147 was building a nuclear reactor to produce weapons - grade plutonium			1
the reactor was later destroyed by @entity153			0
because @entity1 obtained nuclear weapons , its erratic behavior and appalling actions have become almost impossible to stop			1
that reality has come with a terrible cost to the suffering people of its people and with a price tag whose final tally in world peace is still unknown			0
for a country such as @entity31 , the impunity that has followed @entity1 's success on the nuclear pathway is an incentive not to give up its own nuclear program			1
for the rest of the world , it should serve as a reminder of how dangerous it would be to allow more nuclear weapons anywhere , but especially in the @entity180 , the most unstable region on earth			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity185 .			0

@entity1 launched a long - range rocket that broke apart after liftoff
@entity190 : @entity1 defied the world , and there is not much the @entity43 can do
she says the impunity of @entity1 sets a dangerous example
@entity198 : for countries such as @entity31 , there 's more incentive not to give up nuclear program
