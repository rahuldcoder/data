-- even six months ago , @entity1 was the big snoozer in @entity3 's consumer hardware line - up			1
the device is a simple set - top media puck â € ” not much more than a passive conduit for piping @entity7 , @entity9 and @entity11 content to one 's tv			1
but , oh , how times have changed			0
on the eve of @entity15 -- @entity3 's annual developers ' conference -- speculation swirls around @entity3 's positioning as a television manufacturer , and how @entity1 might play into a greater television hardware strategy			1
indeed , an @entity1 reboot could be a game changer			1
and it would also be the @entity15 highlight for users of the set - top puck , for app developers , and even for the tv entertainment industry at large			2
now , granted , @entity3 just revamped the @entity1 user interface with the launch of the third - generation ipad			1
so in some respects , it seems unlikely that @entity3 would feature the product in another media event just a few months later			1
but the streaming tv companion still offers vast untapped potential			0
and with the attendance of thousands of devoted developers , @entity15 is the perfect venue to announce a new @entity1 platform that exposes @entity43 support			2
and we ca n't forget how @entity45 recently said the tv space is " an area of intense interest " for @entity3			2
@entity1 is one of the best set - top devices in a consumer electronics category that , quite frankly , does n't enjoy mass consumer report			2
think about it : how many of your non-techie friends own either a @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 or @entity3 tv ? nonetheless , @entity3 tv sales are picking up momentum : the device is on track to sell twice as many units as were sold in 2011			1
the upshot : @entity3 does n't need to announce its own television set at @entity15 to make waves in the living room space			2
if it can reinvent @entity1 into a truly compelling , mass - market consumer product , it can realize @entity70 ' dream of finally cracking the television code			2
@entity3 just needs to address a few key areas before @entity1 becomes a really big deal			1
apps , apps , and @entity76 " what we might see at @entity15 is @entity3 opening up the app economy approach they 've had with the @entity83 and @entity11 to the @entity1 , " @entity78 analyst @entity77 told @entity0			1
@entity3 has well over 600,000 apps in the @entity85 , but only eight third - party content choices ( e.g. , @entity9 , @entity86 , @entity87 , etc. ) on @entity1			1
so @entity15 offers the perfect opportunity to introduce developers to how they could start expanding @entity1 's repertoire of content choices			2
indeed , @entity94 reported that @entity3 would be introducing an entirely new os and @entity43 for developers to take advantage of			0
there are two possible ways @entity3 could open up the @entity1 platform to third - party app developers : it could allow devs to create dedicated tv apps , or it could more heavily leverage ( and open up ) the @entity76 feature already baked into @entity1 to port existing @entity11 apps to the big screen			1
" we 've been focused on trying to understand how the app model evolves with the introduction of the tv platform , " @entity108 , ceo of online video platform @entity109 told @entity0			0
indeed , @entity108 detailed his thoughts on what could be next for @entity1 in an op - ed monday morning			1
@entity108 believes that instead of requiring developers to code for a third application platform ( the tv ) , @entity117 could be used with existing @entity11 apps			0
@entity117 " essentially turns your @entity11 into a powerful tv apps platform that can render any application on the tv while enabling the user to use their touch - based device to browse , select , navigate , etc. , " @entity108 wrote in his piece			1
@entity11 apps are already built for a screen with a lot of real estate , and it would n't be unnatural to , say , flick through @entity0 's @entity11 app with your finger while actually reading the content on the big screen			0
" @entity76 functionality is a bit hidden from users and not super easy for developers to implement , " @entity108 said of the feature in its current state , so there 's ample room for improvement			1
@entity153 principal analyst @entity152 also believes " a multiscreen component that builds off @entity76 " could be in the stars			0
more content " to get people beyond the hardcore @entity161 fans , you need a lot of content , " @entity157 said			0
for example , average consumers want to see sports â € ” live sports			0
so , for the @entity1 to break out of its " hobby " label ( a label @entity45 might wish he had never used ) , its content offerings will need to drastically expand			0
but live content is hard to come by without a cable or satellite subscription , and that may remain so			0
" history has shown that @entity3 has n't shown the same kind of influence with the studios that they had with the [ music ] labels in the early days of the @entity184 , " @entity152 said			0
however , in light of recent announcements on the @entity188 platform , @entity157 thinks @entity3 could be inking deals with the same content providers who 've partnered with @entity192 : @entity193 , @entity194 , @entity195 , and @entity196			0
to go mainstream and become a true cable / satellite replacement for cord cutters , @entity1 would need to provide the " equivalent experience of hundreds of programming options at any point in time , " @entity157 said			0
expanded app offerings could certainly help with this , but live streaming content would really seal the deal			0
ditch the remote " the other area that 's getting a lot of rumor traction is opening up the @entity212 interface , which for both the existing apps on @entity1 , as well as new apps , could be very interesting , " @entity157 said			1
this could be accomplished through a peripheral add - on to @entity1 , as @entity108 proposed for a forward - looking @entity1 experience			2
and , of course , @entity212 could handshake with the current @entity1 via coordination with the @entity220 ( and maybe even the third - generation @entity11 , if it too receives @entity212 support as rumored			2
) @entity3 could also take an @entity223 - like approach , launching camera devices in its tv products for @entity227 gesture recognition			1
as for relevance to @entity15 , this would mean a new gesture - based motion @entity43 for developers to manage user interaction and face detection , with an actual hardware accessory to arrive in the more distant future			0
but , heck , @entity3 already has patents on @entity227 gesture recognition using the @entity11 , so perhaps an additional accessory is n't even necessary			0
" @entity3 can do a lot with the box they have in terms of disrupting and changing people 's expectations of what tv is , " @entity157 said			1

a major reboot of @entity3 's tv device could be a game changer
the *computer* company could take an @entity223 - like approach with @entity1
@entity3 could allow devs to create dedicated tv apps , and leverage the @entity76 feature
@entity3 is expected to make news at its developer 's conference monday
