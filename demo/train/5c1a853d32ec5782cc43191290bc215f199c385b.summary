-- the @entity1 is the largest collection of humanity 's knowledge			2
through my work in music , i want to show people that the @entity1 can not only break down barriers but also redefine the limits of what is possible			1
the polymaths and @entity13 men of yesteryear had to devote their lives to the pursuit of the same knowledge that we can access with one click			2
i am fortunate to come from a family inclined toward the arts -- thanks to which , they are all very difficult to impress			2
my great - grandfather was an eastern music scholar and multi-instrumentalist			1
he played instruments like the sarangi , the harmonium and the violin			1
he traveled throughout @entity30 and @entity31 to develop and refine his musical style			2
watch @entity33 perform at @entity34 with @entity35 my grandmother , choosing to follow in her father 's footsteps , became an eastern classical musician and a stage performer			1
her brother , my great - uncle , is one of @entity30 's last remaining orators -- professional storytellers who read old stories written by famous writers of the @entity46			2
his wife is one of the country 's leading @entity49 dancers			2
their son , my cousin , is one of the country 's greatest percussion and tabla players			0
my parents were also stage performers , and recognized that i had musical aptitude at an early age			0
i was classically trained in piano since age 6 -- which is how i fell in love with @entity65 classical composers like @entity66 and @entity67			0
as i got older , i wanted to branch out and experiment with other instruments			0
but i felt very limited in @entity30			0
music teachers there are in great demand and tend to focus only on @entity73 classical music			1
it had taken my great - grandfather his whole life to master and play his chosen instruments			1
now , i had no choice but to let the @entity1 be my teacher			1
@entity80 : @entity82 rocks out to " @entity83 " i watched hundreds and hundreds of videos online			1
i would close my eyes and listen to the audio again and again , trying to decipher each note			0
or i would pause the clips at just the right moment to examine the musicians ' finger positions			0
as time went by , it got easier for me to pick up on things from the @entity1			0
i grew more confident , which allowed me to branch out and develop			0
i started playing percussion instruments , the mandolin , the harmonica and more			0
thanks to my classical training , my musical ear also improved , which enabled me to write and arrange orchestral pieces			0
here 's an example , ' @entity105 ' , which i wrote when i was 17			0
@entity80 : @entity106 plays " @entity107 " on the @entity1 , i can manufacture my own philharmonic orchestra , with string sections and woodwinds playing my music from all over the world , as i did with my orchestral album " @entity114 , " which is a full representation of my approach to music and storytelling			1
it is a concept album , each piece is a progression through the innocence and playfulness of youth , the joys and sorrows of life as one gets older , spiritual awakening and finally death			0
i applied to @entity131 's @entity130 after high school , but decided not to go to the audition for admission			0
i wanted to record my music professionally in a studio instead , to clear my head of all the musical ideas that were already building up in my system			1
@entity80 : @entity139 fiddles in real time i try to not limit myself to music ; i get involved in every creative process , such as directing and writing my own musical short films to complement my compositions and i do all the artwork that accompanies my music , such as the sleeve paintings for the " @entity114 " @entity148 it was an honor to be chosen as a 2012 @entity80			1
to perform onstage with @entity35 , one of my all - time favorite musicians , was something i will never forget for the rest of my life			1
and i was able to discuss learning with @entity80 curator @entity155 , who has described how the @entity1 is encouraging people around the world to develop skills , such as the ability to learn to play musical instruments , that might have previously been out of reach			2
apart from my classical training in piano , i have learned everything i know about music by watching other people -- many of them the best in their fields -- play online			1
to me , that has been the best way to learn			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity33 .			1

@entity33 : acquiring skill in music has long required learning from teachers
he says the role of the teacher can now be *fulfilled* through online *resources*
@entity33 : i learned to master percussive **guitar** through watching others on video
at @entity34 conference , @entity33 played **guitar** with one of his heroes , @entity35
