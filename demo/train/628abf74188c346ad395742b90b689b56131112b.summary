-- a fire , a fuel leak , mechanical issues			2
for a passenger about to board @entity6 's next - generation @entity6 aircraft , reports of parts of the plane not working properly do n't inspire confidence			1
after years of manufacturing delays and cost overruns , the state - of - the - art @entity6 debuted in 2011			2
yet a string of maintenance issues have put the much - anticipated plane into a less rosy light			2
on tuesday , a @entity18 flight aborted takeoff from @entity21 's @entity20 for @entity22 after a pilot on another airplane spotted the 787 leaking fuel			1
on monday , a maintenance worker discovered an electrical fire aboard an empty @entity18 787 slated for departure from @entity20			0
in december , a @entity29 787 traveling from @entity30 to @entity31 was diverted to @entity32 after experiencing mechanical problems			1
despite the flurry of reports , aviation experts say most new commercial airplanes do encounter problems after their launch			1
read more : 7 reasons the @entity6 is special every new airplane is going to have these kinds of " teething problems , " said @entity44 , a former @entity45 member and former airline mechanic			1
the manufacturers usually " get a handle on it quickly and fix it			0
" that 's @entity6 's plan			1
" there are issues we have seen that we will need to work through and just like any new airplane program we work through those issues and we move on , " said @entity52 , @entity6 vice president and chief project engineer for the 787 , during a conference call with reporters on wednesday			0
in the 15 months the aircraft has been flying passengers , @entity52 says its on - time departure rating has been " in the high 90 percents			1
" that measure is about the same as @entity6 's last major new commercial airplane , the 777 , which was launched in 1995			1
" these are best - in - class airplanes and their performance has been best in class , " he said			0
" but we are not happy until we are perfect			0
" newer airplanes are safer than ever , @entity44 said			0
" we are flying more airplanes that have been engineered to be safer , " he said			0
" we almost ( never ) have material failures in airplanes anymore			0
" part of the @entity6 's appeal to airlines is its increased fuel efficiency due to its construction of lightweight composite materials instead of metal			1
the interior features larger windows and overhead bins and better ventilation			0
problems on other new aircraft the @entity90 also had problems when it started flying in 2007 , but aviation expert @entity92 loves to fly it			1
" it had cracks in the wing , which would be much more concerning to me " than the 787 reports , said @entity92 , a @entity93 aviation history professor			0
" they figured it out			0
pilots want to get to their destination alive as much as anybody so they do n't mess around			0
" like the 787 , the @entity103 was also a " game changer " and had a lot of issues when it started flying in 1970 , according to aviation consultant @entity107			1
" the engines on the first ones were a leap at the time and had big problems but they got through it , " said @entity107			1
" i think the potential and perceived operational advantages of the aircraft are such that airline orders will stick with the 787 through this situation			2
" the size of the key players in the commercial aircraft game -- @entity6 and @entity90 -- lend a lot of weight to maintenance issues , said @entity92 , who said she looks forward to flying the 787			1
" what makes this a bigger story is that essentially we have two companies only that make these really big airplanes			2
" they dominate the world market so their company is on the line when this happens			0
they are both 900 - pound gorillas			0
misfortune for one company might benefit the other			0
" situation room : go inside @entity6 's new @entity6 computers fly the plane as computers do more of the work that pilots used to do , any kind of electrical failure does concern aviation historian @entity148 , author of " @entity149 as @entity150 : @entity151 , @entity152 , and @entity153			1
" " more of the human function of piloting has been transferred to equipment itself			0
in general , that 's been a great thing for passenger safety , " said @entity148			2
" that 's why any kind of electrical failure in a new piece of equipment is alarming , because there is so much electrically driven			2
" @entity148 does n't think the 787 's problems will slow down the computerization of flight that 's been going on for more than 30 years			1
" whatever the particular flaws of this aircraft , it 's a setback for @entity6 and this design , but it no way indicates a trend away from these kinds of advanced , electronically sophisticated aircraft that essentially fly themselves			1
" for his part , @entity6 engineer @entity52 is concerned , but is " 100 percent convinced " the 787 is safe to fly			2
" i 'm concerned about the things that everybody else is concerned about , but there is not a single one of them that stands out as a particular concern from a safety or economic perspective			0
" @entity0 's @entity186 and @entity187 contributed to this report .			2

it 's *normal* for new aircraft to have problems in their first year of flight , experts say
both the @entity90 and the @entity103 went through growing pains when they were *introduced*
the trend of electronically sophisticated aircraft that essentially fly themselves is likely to continue
