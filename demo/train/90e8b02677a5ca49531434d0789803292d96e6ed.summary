-- research into the @entity3 virus suggests the risk of contracting serious illness rises with age and that more people may be infected than the 105 cases reported , according to a study by the @entity10			1
@entity11 , associate professor at @entity10 's public health research center , told @entity0 that a disparity had emerged in data focusing people 's exposure to live poultry			2
" essentially there are more exposures to poultry in older adults than in younger adults , but the difference in exposures is not as big as when we look at the differences in age of the number of serious @entity3 infections , " @entity11 said			2
he said that if age were not a factor in the seriousness of infection , then researchers could expect the pattern of the disease to exactly match the pattern of exposure			0
" what we 're seeing is that half the serious cases are above 60 years of age , " he said			2
@entity43 symptoms also meant that many more people may be infected with the virus than is currently known because people potentially infected with @entity3 were not seeking medical attention for what seems like a mild cough or fever			2

" it 's easier , then , to reduce onward transmission			0
" so far , however , there is no evidence of human - to - human transmission in @entity3			1
researchers were struggling to discover why an early strain of bird flu -- @entity71 -- attacked a mainly younger demographic of people in their 20s and 30s			0
exactly why influenza strains are more serious in different age groups was still a subject of ongoing investigation , @entity11 said			0
" it 's not completely clear what happened in the @entity81 , " he said			0
" certainly the burden of severe illnesses fell disproportionately on younger adults			0
" he said the normal profile of an influenza epidemic was that the highest proportion of infection is with younger children			0

" @entity102 officials this week visited @entity103 as part of a week - long visit to @entity54 to gauge the response to the outbreak			1
@entity108 , assistant director - general for health security and environment of the @entity102 told a news conference that there was no " sustained " pattern to the @entity3 outbreak that suggested human - to - human contact			1
last week , however , a spokesperson from the @entity117 said that as many 40 % of the cases had had no contact with poultry			0
@entity54 's health ministry on monday confirmed a total of 105 cases , in @entity103 , the capital @entity125 and four provinces including @entity127 for the first time			1
