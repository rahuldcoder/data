-- with no time left on the clock , members of @entity2 finally reached a deal that would reopen the federal government and raise the debt ceiling			1
as the world watched @entity2 stumble and tumble toward the brink of default , @entity8 and @entity9 finally agreed on a deal that gained enough support in the @entity15 to bring this episode to a close			1
some democrats and pundits have concluded that @entity18 are walking away the victors			2
they correctly argue that the @entity9 has become so damaged in the polls as a result of their hardball tactics that they are extremely vulnerable in the 2014 midterms and could very well suffer in the presidential election of 2016 as a result of these debates			1
president @entity30 also walks away from this deal with the @entity32 generally intact , as conservative proposals to repeal the program recede further and further away from political reality			1
in 2011 , when threatened with the debt ceiling , @entity30 conceded to @entity9 demands by agreeing to the @entity38			1
this time he refused to negotiate			0
but can @entity18 really claim victory ? not really			2
as the dust settles , @entity9 might find themselves pretty content with the outcome of this battle			2
in terms of public policy , they have kept the president on the defensive and kept their main issue front and center			0
throughout much of the past month and a half , when the president hoped to return from the congressional recess to push the immigration bill through the @entity15 , all attention has centered on sequestration , repealing the @entity32 , cutting spending and avoiding fiscal catastrophe			0
all of the other energy has been sucked out of @entity57			2
even with the current deal , the sequestration remains in effect , severely harming government agencies that have undergone cuts as well as those in desperate need of funding increases			2
@entity2 and the administration will now embark on more extensive discussions about budget reform that will consume the attention of both parties until the middle of january			0
for now , sequestration remains in place , leaving many agencies with insufficient funds			0
the battle has also been beneficial to @entity9 in that they have continued the process of normalizing the use of radical tactics in pushing for cuts to the federal government			1
just as many @entity82 seemed to accept sequestration , conservative @entity9 have not yet felt any serious political threat as a result of their having forced a government shutdown			1
nor is it clear that there will be any negative consequences to them for having gone to the brink of a federal default in their fight for concessions on the budget deal			1
if they are left standing , there is little reason to think that they wo n't use these tactics once again			0
the last month offers them a template			0
furthermore , the current deal simply postpones any decision and actually sets up another round of fights when @entity2 returns from its winter break in december			0
the new year will look very much like the one that came before			0
given the pattern we have seen , conservative republicans will be just as likely , even more likely , to employ the same kind of aggressive tactics and try to force the administration into accepting deep cuts in domestic spending if @entity30 wants to keep the economy in stable condition			1
9 things we missed during the shutdown conservatives will be even more emboldened as they seek to please their constituents going into the 2014 midterm elections			0
the deal that emerged from the @entity8 is simply a continuation of the kind of political chaos that we have witnessed since the 2010 midterms			0
@entity30 will have to start fighting on this issue as soon as the ink is dry			1
@entity30 has spent much of his second term on defense , responding to pressure from @entity15 @entity9 to cut spending and trying to combat their use of radical procedural weapons			1
this crisis was clearly the most dangerous moment for the country			0
and it is true that @entity30 and congressional @entity18 walk away having achieved important objectives			1
after all , the government is up and running again , at least for the time being , and @entity2 has raised the debt ceiling , thereby averting a global meltdown			2
but @entity9 have defined the national agenda and forced a deal that does n't resolve debate			2
just the opposite : it ensures that the fights will continue and the threat of default continues into the foreseeable future			0
until @entity18 find a way to reach some kind of long - term budget accord by building sufficient pressure -- and electoral support -- to push back against the @entity163 , they 'll find themselves on the losing side of this issue over and over again			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity168			0

a deal will reopen government and avert a default on @entity82 debt
@entity168 : some have argued the deal is a total @entity18 win
he says the reality is @entity9 can continue to make budget cutting *dominant* issue in @entity57
@entity168 : @entity9 can use same tactics in 2014 to force @entity30 to focus on their concerns
