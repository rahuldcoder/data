-- @entity1 , @entity2 , @entity3 ; the world 's dairy cattle breeds bear the names of some of the wettest , lushest , and greenest places in @entity9 , testament to the fact that to produce milk you need a lot of water			1
industry experts say one cow must consume three liters of water a day to produce one liter of milk			0
for high - performing cattle that 's equal to 150 liters a day			2
@entity21 -- with an average annual rainfall of just 2.3 inches ( 59mm ) -- might seem an unlikely candidate to be among the world 's top 10 dairy producers , but its mega-dairy @entity27 has grown to be one of the biggest food producers in the @entity30			1
@entity31 , a dairy economist at the @entity32 , says the vast milking plants that dot the @entity30 region employ an industry standard known as the " @entity37 model " to run dairies in some of the driest regions of the world			1
" the @entity37 model is simply that you do n't have to grow all your grass and raise your own feed crops , you can import feed and water and all your input and house a thousand head of dairy cattle on just 40 acres of land , " @entity31 told @entity0			1
he said as long as the water and feed could be sourced , then dairy operations of this type were sustainable			2
" the other side of sustainable , of course , is whether they get the price they want for the milk they produce , but i assume that they do , " he said			0
from food security to big exports established with the help of @entity67 agribusiness pioneers @entity63 and @entity64 in 1977 , @entity27 began modestly with just 300 head of cattle as part of a @entity21 push to achieve food security through self - sufficiency -- a government response to the oil shocks of the 1970s			1
forty years later and the company is a diversified regional giant selling juices , poultry , baked products and infant formula			0
with a total herd of 135,000 dairy cattle , @entity27 's installation at @entity84 80 kilometers ( 50 miles ) south of the capital @entity87 , houses one of its largest herds of 67,000			1
the company 's statistics are staggering : the entire herd produces 2.5 million liters of milk a day -- an average of 40 liters per cow per day roughly double the @entity9 average			0
technology to beat the heat the secret to making a dairy successful in one of the world 's most arid environments is to apply technology -- and a lot of it			1
at normal desert temperatures that can reach as high 50 degrees @entity109 , milk production would normally plummet , the produce would spoil quickly and dangerous bacteria would form			0
however , every step of the process of keeping the @entity3 milking cows at a perfect temperature of between 21 and 23 degrees @entity109 ( 70 and 73 degrees @entity112 ) is automated			0

fans also keep them dry and prevent puddles from forming			0
as well as computers that monitor the temperature and humidity in the installations , workers put the cattle through stationary water jets - a process that ensures the milk is not contaminated with manure - before the cattle are milked four times daily			0
after the cows are milked , the mega-factory goes through the process of pasteurizing the dairy products , bottling and packaging it			2
@entity27 's fleet of 1,000 refrigerated tankers then deliver it to 55,000 stores in six @entity30 nations			1
water worries @entity21 is not the only @entity152 to have automated its milk production			1
in the nearby @entity155 , the @entity154 , the largest in the @entity155 and a competitor to @entity27 , has per cow yields at 10,000 liters a year , almost the equal of @entity27 's 12,400 liters a year			1
however , critics warn that the high yields of @entity27 and other @entity30 dairies carry a cost			1
seen from @entity163 , the irrigation pivots of @entity84 stand out like green crop circles in the rocky brown of the desert			0
just 40 years ago , @entity21 's underground store of fossil water was estimated at 500 cubic kilometers , enough to fill @entity169 , according to a report published by @entity171			1
read more : @entity172 , @entity173 or @entity174 ? it estimates four - fifths of the aquifers are now depleted			0
with practically no rainfall to replenish them , it has been reported that the government intends to phase out wheat production by 2016			0
many of the irrigation pivots at @entity84 stand unused and the @entity21 government is coy about their future			2
in the meantime , @entity21 investment in land near the headwaters of the @entity190 in the @entity192 region of @entity193 has caused controversy			1
@entity197 , in a 2012 report , said that foreign investors from @entity21 and @entity199 had acquired large tracts of land and that it had evidence that some 70,000 indigenous people in the western @entity192 region were relocated against their will to new villages that " lack adequate food , farmland , healthcare and educational facilities "			2
the @entity211 , an ngo , issued a critical report on @entity214 's @entity192 investment in @entity193 in june last year , alleging that the company failed to conduct an environmental impact assessment and that residents reported the threat of force from @entity193 authorities if they did not resettle			0
meanwhile , the @entity21 government has denied that its investment in the region has uprooted the region 's indigenous people			1
" i never heard of even a single displacement , " @entity21 agriculture minister dr @entity225 said in media reports			2
" if you or any other correspondent will show us a clear displacement or land grab or whatever by @entity21 investment , please let us know			2
i assure you there are none whatsoever			0

@entity21 dairy has become one of the biggest in the region
@entity27 began as a small farm in 1970s with 300 cows
situated in one of world 's most arid regions , indoor farms rely on ' @entity37 model '
critics point to high use of water and depletion of ancient underground water *reserves*
