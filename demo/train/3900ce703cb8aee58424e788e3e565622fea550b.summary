on board the @entity1 -- @entity3 ... @entity4			0
the very sound of the @entity7 train horn is among the most evocative bits of @entity9			1
it conjures up images of giant locomotives , ploughing their way across the country			0
with romantic names like " the @entity16 , " " the @entity17 , " " @entity18 , " and my home for the next week , " the @entity1			0
" the train is @entity22			1
because while the horse and covered wagon gave rise to the frontier spirit , it was the country 's railroad that propelled this vast nation into becoming an economic powerhouse			1
the @entity31 may have been won on horseback , but it was the train that carried the swathes of victors to those newly claimed lands			0
the railroads became the backbone of the country			0
transporting labor from one side to the other and the goods they produced to the entire country			0
@entity44 country : the start of @entity2 's @entity46 in tough times the railways that criss - crossed the nascent country served to bind the federation together after the trauma of civil war ; they enabled the breadbasket of @entity22 's @entity53 to send the crops they grew to feed the rest of the country			1
as the industrial revolution took hold the new giant steel mills , coal mines and factories of the @entity62 took advantage of the opportunities rail created to reach growing cities , and docks to export overseas			2
put simply , @entity22 's railroads built the nation that exists today			1
but having built the country , by the 20th century the railroads found themselves in an impossible place			0
they fell victim to the individualism inherent in the new motor car and then the speed inherent in air travel			2
@entity78 was in a distant third place			0
by the 1970s , rail travel was in deep decline , and @entity7 was founded in an attempt to arrest its fall			1
in a major development , @entity84 legislated control of the passenger railways and gave it to @entity7			1
it began service on may 1 , 1971 , with 21 routes spanning 43 states			0
@entity7 was a patchwork of stations , routes and services , which frequently failed to make much sense			1
throughout its life @entity7 has made the argument , repeatedly , that rail is the most cost - effective and environmentally sound form of travel			1
far from being sidelined , it has pleaded for greater investment to open up new high - speed routes and encourage more ridership			0
in some parts of the country it has enjoyed spectacular success in its battle with air travel			2
between @entity111 and @entity112 the train dominates , with 75 % of the market , including via its high speed @entity115 service			0
for the north east corridor from @entity118 to @entity112 , @entity7 carried 11 million passengers last year , 36 % of @entity7 's total number of riders			2
the north - east remains fortress @entity7 ; but in parts of the country where you 'd think it would be the preferred way to travel , such as @entity129 to @entity130 , or @entity131 , it is still has a long way to go in increasing its market share			1
to hear @entity7 's critics , including @entity136 , you would think the train company was swimming in public cash			2
but while last year the entire network received a total of $ 1.4 billion in operating and capital subsidies , in this year 's presidential election the @entity142 have threatened to do away with the subsidy			1
but away from these current hostilities , politics and the railways have actually long been brothers			0
no election campaign during the 1800s would be complete without a " whistle - stop tour " - when candidates would charter trains and speak to the voters from the caboose			2
an iconic picture in @entity22 political history is a victorious @entity158 standing on the back of a train , holding an early edition newspaper reporting his defeat			2
the 1996 election saw @entity164 campaigning his way across @entity22 by rail			1
@entity7 's annual report from that year says , " when the presidential candidates wanted to travel across the country with speed , they flew ; but when they wanted to make a statement , to see the countryside and to create a symbol of being in touch with @entity22 's roots , they took @entity7			1
" to help increase its appeal today @entity7 runs magnificent trains across @entity22 appealing to the tourist and those wanting a more relaxed form of travel			1
double deck carriages and panoramic windows offer interstate travel for those seeking a more leisurely journey			0
and that is where you find me today -- on board the @entity1			0
it is one of @entity7 's most famous services , taking 48 hours from @entity129 to @entity196 , making 34 stops on the way , across seven states			2
on the first sector of the journey , my accommodations include a " roomette " with a couchette for sleeping			0
later on i will have a family - sized cabin to stretch out in as we cross @entity209			0
in the days ahead i will tell you much more about life on the @entity7 train -- for now , let me just leave you with the thought that there remain few better ways of discovering the many faces of the real @entity22 than to visit by rail , especially in an election year .			1

@entity220 propelled @entity22 into becoming economic powerhouse
by 1970s , rail travel was in decline , and @entity7 founded in bid to arrest its fall
in this election , *republicans* have threatened to do away with subsidy
few better ways of discovering faces of the real @entity22 than to visit by rail
