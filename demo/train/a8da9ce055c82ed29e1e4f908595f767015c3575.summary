editor 's note : a nationally syndicated columnist , @entity2 is the author of " listening to the @entity4 " and " speak , @entity5 ! a @entity7 's view of @entity8			1
" visit his web site for more information			0
@entity2 says few have understood how much power is wielded by @entity13 adviser @entity12			1
( @entity14 ) -- five days after the 2008 presidential election , @entity15 of " @entity16 " did a profile on " @entity13 's brain trust , " four political veterans that he reported were the president - elect 's most important team members : @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26			1
when the report aired , i immediately asked myself , " where 's @entity12 ? " -- as in @entity12 , clearly the most important adviser to the president			1
after calling around , i discovered that @entity32 did n't even know about the sit - down interview			1
as @entity34 used to say on his show , " things that make you go , ' hmmm			0
' " but after reading the @entity40 cover story on the 52 - year - old @entity32 , a longtime @entity41 , @entity42 , business executive , it 's safe to say that that mistake will never happen again			1
@entity44 is all about power and the approximation to power			0
who is in and who is out is the favorite parlor game among the elites , and the wide assumption by many was that when it came to whom the president relied on the most for advice and counsel , it would have been chief of staff @entity58 , senior adviser @entity25 and press secretary @entity24			2
yet i 'll be willing to bet you a few bucks that after the @entity65 piece hit the streets , @entity44 power players were picking up the phone and trying desperately to get on @entity32 's calendar			1
and for those who mistook her as nothing more than a @entity41 hack benefiting from a great friendship , they are trying to figure out how to get in her good graces			0
in the course of 8,100 words , writer @entity77 made it clear that by her long association with president @entity13 and his wife , @entity82 , no one in the @entity83 knows them better than @entity32 , and that their longtime confidant and mentor is unmistakably the one voice , other than his wife , that the president relies on			1
" over time , i think our relationship evolved to the point where she 's like a sibling to me			0
... i trust her completely , " he told @entity77			0
yet what was also interesting about @entity77 's article was the jealous nature of the men around the president			2
now , i 'm sure they will be quick to say that @entity77 focused on the negative aspect of their comments and not their effusive praise of @entity32 , but a read of the article makes it plain that there is friction there , which is nothing new in the @entity83			1
@entity25 came off as dismissive of @entity32 's contributions by asserting that she has best served on dealing with " family issues			1
" in fact , there has been lingering resentment among some in the campaign going back to when @entity25 told a reporter with @entity123 that @entity32 was helpful to the campaign , namely with handling black media			2
i recall several officials inside and outside the campaign ticked off at the statement			0
@entity77 writes that @entity58 was none too happy when discovering that @entity32 discussed office space with @entity131 's chief of staff , @entity130 , and actually confronted her			2
@entity58 called it a " misunderstanding , " but again , in @entity44 , power is often seen based on office size and proximity to the president , and it must drive the chief of staff nuts to know that his voice is n't the last one the president relies on			2
@entity23 , who ran the president 's campaign , clearly is shown as not caring for @entity32 , telling @entity77 " she was n't terribly involved in strategic issues			1
" that 's pretty funny considering she was knee - deep in the direction of the campaign			0
but she was n't at all greeted warmly by the officials at the top of the campaign			2
if anyone says the two got along well in the campaign , trust me , they are lying			0
i 'm sure the three of these gents are now asking themselves , " what does the president think about the article ? " the last thing they want to do is to have the boss sense their dismissal of his most trusted adviser			2
frankly , it 's smart for @entity13 -- or any politician -- to have someone as close as @entity32 by your side			1
all too often in life , and especially politics , influential people have a group of " yes men and women " who are n't willing to challenge them to make the best decisions			0
as the article illustrates -- and i know of other instances -- where the candidate wanted to go one way , those close to him , unwilling to risk the wrath of @entity13 , capitulated			2
but on those occasions , @entity32 saw things differently , and because of her total and complete understanding of the candidate , he agreed to follow her instruction			0
finally , it 's worth noting that @entity32 's gender and race is also important to this equation			1
her presence means that it 's no longer about " @entity199 " being a group of smart white guys			0
she brings her experiences as a woman , an @entity205 - @entity8 woman , a businesswoman , to the table , and she does n't see the world through the prism of a white male			0
our ethnicity and gender play a role in how we make decisions , whether we want to admit it or not			0
and it 's high time that we have greater diversity among the upper echelon of a president 's advisers			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			0

@entity2 : presidential adviser @entity12 has been *underestimated*
@entity2 says other top aides have *downplayed* @entity32 's influence on president @entity13
he says @entity32 has shown an ability to sway @entity13 when others ca n't
@entity2 : it 's important to have diversity among top @entity83 advisers
