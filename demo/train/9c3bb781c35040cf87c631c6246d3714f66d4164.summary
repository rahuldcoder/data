-- after being accused of taking thousands from illegal immigrants in exchange for driver 's licenses , a @entity2 state employee might be forced to pay a hefty price after being nabbed in a multi-agency inquiry			1
the @entity10 @entity9 announced monday the results of their federal bribery investigation centered on @entity13 , a 28 - year - old @entity14 native			2
an anonymous tip into the @entity17 ' compliance division sparked the investigation in september 2010 , with the caller alleging that two people had illegally gotten driver 's licenses through one of the agency 's employees			1
the resulting joint probe eventually involved members of the @entity27 and the @entity28 , or @entity28 , which describes itself as " the principal investigative arm of the @entity9			0
" according to @entity32 's news release , illegal immigrants would go to a @entity14 dmv office and wait in the lobby near @entity13 , a @entity33 technician			1
the federal agency said she 'd then call them over to her station and fill out their " fraudulent paperwork " -- even though they did n't provide required documents to prove they were eligible for a driver 's license			2
after taking their pictures and paying their fees , the people walked off with temporary licenses , the release said			0
authorities estimate that @entity13 processed 187 such illicit driver 's licenses , charging between $ 1,700 and $ 3,000 for each one			1
the complaint against @entity13 was filed april 29 , and she was arrested on thursday			2
the next day , she was in court to face a federal program bribery charge			0
@entity10 magistrate judge @entity54 released her on a personal recognizance bond , the @entity9 said in its release			0
" trafficking in counterfeit document poses a serious security vulnerability , one that often contributes to a host of crimes -- including identity theft and financial fraud , " said @entity57 , an @entity28 assistant special agent , in the statement on @entity13 's case			0
@entity0 called the federal public defender representing @entity13 on monday evening , seeking her client 's response to the allegations , but has n't received a reply			2
this is the latest but hardly the only case involving people fraudulently getting driver 's licenses			1
earlier this spring , police arrested 11 bus drivers around @entity79 suspected of using phony aliases to get driver 's licenses , @entity76 gov. @entity75 announced in a news release			1
@entity83 has also seen several such investigations			0
in february , gov. @entity85 said in a statement that state and federal investigators there arrested five illegal nationals of @entity92 descent and accused them of charging people $ 6,000 to illegally obtain a @entity83 driver 's license			1
investigators claim that the men helped these people get fake documents so they could fulfill requirements to get a license			0
and in 2008 , another @entity33 employee -- @entity101 , then 52 and also from @entity14 -- was indicted by a federal grand jury on charges that she solicited and took money from illegal immigrants in exchange for driver 's licenses and identity cards			1
after a plea agreement , she was sentenced to three years of probation and forced to pay a $ 1,000 fine , according to a federal court document .			0
