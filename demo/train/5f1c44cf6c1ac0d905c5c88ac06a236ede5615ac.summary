@entity0 -- president @entity9 and his administration " strongly condemn the outrageous and deplorable violence that 's taken place on the streets of @entity7 today " and want it to end quickly , @entity3 press secretary @entity2 said wednesday			2
supporters of @entity13 president @entity12 attacked anti-government demonstrators in @entity7 's @entity15 , and the ensuing violence killed three people and injured more than 600 , according to @entity13 's health minister			1
" it is our hope that what we saw today we wo n't see tomorrow or friday or into the weekend , " @entity2 told reporters			0
" obviously ... this is not all going to be wrapped up in a matter of hours			0
it 's going to take some time			0
" @entity2 reiterated the @entity9 administration 's opposition to any violence in the @entity13 demonstrations , either by @entity13 security forces , protesters or criminal elements			1
he added that if the @entity13 government is instigating any of the violence , " it should stop immediately			1
" at the @entity37 , spokesman @entity36 called the attacks by what he described as " thugs " a clear attempt to intimidate the anti-government protesters , who were demonstrating for a ninth straight day			0
the @entity43 does n't know the identity of the " thugs , " @entity36 said , adding that others have identified them as " supporters of the government			2
" in an operation that started monday , more than 1,900 @entity43 citizens and their family members have been evacuated from @entity13 , @entity36 said , adding that further evacuations would take place thursday			1
the attacks came the day after @entity12 announced he would not seek re-election as part of a series of political reforms			2
opposition activists and protesters , however , said @entity12 must step down immediately with a caretaker unity government running the country until elections for president and a new parliament can take place			1
it was unclear whether such confrontations were being repeated elsewhere			0
other @entity7 neighborhoods were calm , and contesting rallies in @entity13 's second largest city , @entity72 , were largely peaceful			0
@entity2 said the time for a political transition in @entity13 " is now " because the @entity13 people " need to see change , " and a " meaningful transition must include opposition voices and parties being involved in this process as we move toward free and fair elections			1
" at the same time , @entity2 noted that events in @entity13 " have moved enormously quickly in a very volatile region of the world , " adding : " what we 're watching is history being made			1
" high - level contacts between the @entity43 and @entity13 governments continued wednesday , with secretary of state @entity90 talking to newly appointed @entity13 vice president @entity91 , @entity36 said			1
and @entity93 spokesman @entity92 said defense secretary @entity94 spoke by phone with @entity13 's defense minister on wednesday , their third conversation in recent days			0
those contacts followed separate meetings on monday between former @entity43 ambassador to @entity13 @entity102 , who traveled to @entity7 to deliver a message on behalf of @entity9 , with @entity12 and @entity91 , according to @entity36			1
a senior @entity37 official said on condition of not being identified that @entity12 has " a narrow amount of time " to make changes or take steps , with more demonstrations planned for friday			0
however , the official said " there is a sentiment in the ( @entity13 ) government they can outlive the protesters			1
" " this is a false assumption , " the official said			0
" they are not going away			0
" meanwhile , a senior @entity43 official who spoke on condition of not being identified expressed concern that @entity12 loyalists might have unleashed @entity123 forces to intimidate protesters			1
the @entity9 administration believes @entity12 's inner circle is debating whether @entity12 needs to do more to meet protester demands , according to the senior @entity43 official			1
however , an @entity13 government official said on condition of not being identified that his government has a " serious problem " with how the @entity9 administration has been " spinning " the events to give the impression that @entity12 's statement tuesday night resulted from pressure from @entity9			1
" this is @entity12 's decision , " the @entity13 official said			2
" clearly , yes , he has been listening to the messages coming from the administration ... but at the end of the day , this is a decision he had come to on his own in the interests of @entity13 , first and foremost , and as he said , as a result of listening very carefully to the demands of the @entity13 people			0
" the @entity13 official said his government has rejected calls by @entity9 and other world leaders to begin the transition now			2
" this is an @entity13 process , " the official said			0
" what president @entity12 said is that his primary responsibility is to ensure security and order so as to ensure a peaceful transfer of power so that the @entity13 people may decide their next leader in the upcoming presidential elections			2
" the official noted that the steps announced by @entity12 included the resignation of the government , formation of a new cabinet , appointment of @entity91 as vice president , announcing he will not run again , planned changes to the constitution , opening a dialogue with the opposition and various issues involving last year 's parliamentary elections			0
