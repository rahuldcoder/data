@entity0 , @entity1 -- if the crooked blue staircase , colorful crank and dangling bathtub looked familiar , well , that 's the point			1
" who wants to play ' @entity11 ' -- and sign a waiver ? " a big top voice boomed across the @entity8 at the @entity9 in @entity0 , @entity1 , this summer			1
at this annual celebration of @entity18 culture , of course this would appear : a scaled - up version of " @entity21 , " the @entity14 game bent on marbles zigging through a plastic labyrinth			1
and the circus voice ? that would be @entity26 , creator of the larger - than - life board game			1
almost every run begins with a boardwalk - style sales pitch of his grand machine			2
" are there any engineers in the house ? " a voice bellowed over the sound system , drawing a few claps			0
" who likes to do math in here ? " it demanded , drawing ... nothing			0
" let 's not have this weak applause for math ! math ! " @entity26 played " @entity21 " a lot as a kid -- kind of			1
nobody followed the rules , he said			0
they just liked to build the machine and make it work			0
in his house , they built and rebuilt the contraption so often , they 'd get a new version of the game every couple years			1
" i decided one day to put three of them together to see if i could make them all work and hopefully not poke my sister 's eye out , " he said			2
his sister 's eye was fine			2
and as he grew up , the mystique of the @entity67 did n't leave him			0
why @entity69 machines still matter in 2012 it took him 13 years and 50,000 pounds of stuff to build the big one			0
the crane alone took two years : it 's all hand - built , but it 's capable of lifting a two - ton safe 30 feet in the air			1
its role in the game was to trap a plastic mouse			2
because this is real life , and the @entity9 , its role was to crush a junked white @entity82			0
" it 's the grand finale , " @entity26 said			1
but you 've got to ask : why ? why build it ? why take it on the road ? ( he did a 10,000 - mile tour last year , @entity26 said			1
considering it costs $ 3 a mile to move , it ai n't cheap			0
) why put the time , money , effort into oversized rainy day entertainment ? spectacle			0
@entity26 is a showman and artist , in addition to being a builder			1
he likes the craft , the handiwork , doing something he does n't really understand			0
he 's not really a physics guy , but this project turned him into one			1
so why not everybody else ? " one of our major goals is to teach kids and adults about the physics that surround us , " @entity26 said			1
" give us the really unplugged vision -- you know it 's not wired in			1
it 's the real thing with counterweights and science and engineering			1
" it 's just an idea , but the guy is on to something			2
a new set of standards for science education is in development now and expected to debut early next year			1
classrooms might feel a bit more like @entity26 's machine than tidy rows of desks , said @entity129 , interim executive director of the @entity130			1
how a 21st - century science class should look some kids excel with a page of gray text			1
others need to see something bubble or break before they can really understand			0
and all of them can benefit from realizing that experiments on paper do n't always work in practice			0
@entity129 has seen those kind of revelations happen in science classes			2
students have had to design a system of pulleys , planes and screws to do something simple like put cereal in a bowl			0
( for the advanced crowd , make ' em do the math for milk , too			0
) " the computer screen , like the physics textbook , can be pretty clean			2
physics is a lot cleaner when you do n't have to worry about air resistance , " @entity129 said			2
" using it as a team , in the real world , very much mimics what the @entity165 engineers have to do			0
" states can decide whether to adopt the standards , but demand from students , teachers and corporate @entity172 makes @entity129 optimistic for the future of hands - on , " really unplugged " science , as @entity26 put it			1
" it 's going to be messy , " @entity129 said			2
" it 's going to be a challenge for the country to get behind that , but it 's much more directed toward creating ( science , technology , engineering and math ) careers			1
" they wo n't be smashing cars , but they will be putting cereal in a cereal bowl			0
" @entity26 , for what it 's worth , is n't always smashing cars , either			1
he knows all too well that not every test in every experiment will work			0
his big machine takes five days to assemble with a crew of 10 , builders and performers all of them			0
" just like the board game , " he said , " there are moments when it does not work			1
" as a crowd gathered , a man with two kids sidled up against the protective barrier around the mousetrap			0
" ahhh , " he sighed			0
" the smell of invention ! " the kids rolled their eyes , but they did n't budge from their primo trap - watching spot			0
when the weight fell , they cheered with the hundreds of other folks who 'd gathered to take in the spectacle			0
" you just saw , " @entity26 belted out , " a successful @entity69 chain reaction ! "			2

" @entity11 " is a large - scale version of the classic board game
creator @entity26 said it applies physics *concepts* -- and it 's just fun to see
hands - on and *problem* - based learning will be *key* parts of new *school* science standards
