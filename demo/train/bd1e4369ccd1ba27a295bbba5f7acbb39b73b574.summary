-- sunday 's parliamentary election in @entity2 delivered a crushing blow to @entity4 and @entity5 , the two dominant parties that have ruled the country for the last 37 years			1
in the coming weeks , expect uncertainty , shifting alliances and growing frustration as a new political landscape struggles to emerge from the wreckage of the old			1
as the main backers of @entity2 's second bailout and the harsh austerity measures that accompanied it , @entity4 and @entity5 saw their combined share of votes plunge , as angry voters punished them for two years of wage and pension cuts and rising taxes			2
@entity5 , in particular , which won a landslide election in 2009 and made the fateful decision to seek the financial assistance of euro zone partners and the @entity27 in 2010 , saw its support collapse			0
coming in second at the polls was @entity31 , a left wing party fiercely opposed to privatization , public sector spending cuts and labor market reform			0
the other four parties that garnered enough parliamentary votes , ranging from the unreconstructed @entity38 to the @entity40 thugs of @entity41 , are also opposed to further austerity			2
what will happen next will depend on the ability of the frontrunners to form a coalition government made up of @entity48 forces that will meet the conditions set by @entity2 's official creditors for the disbursement of further funds			1
these conditions include the adoption of spending cuts worth 11.5 billion euros for 2013 - 2014 by next month , as well as quick progress in privatization and the opening up of closed professions , two areas in which neither the former nor current prime minister made any significant headway			0
@entity63 , head of @entity4 , said initially that his party was willing to lead a coalition government with the aim of keeping @entity2 in the euro zone and amending the policies of the loan agreement so that they could promote growth			1
but he has relinquished the mandate to form a government after talks broke down with the leaders of other parties , including @entity31 , @entity5 and the @entity76			2
@entity31 , the real winner in the election , has made it clear that it plans to reject the new loan agreement and come to a new understanding with @entity2 's euro zone partners			1
this position makes it hard for it to take part in a national unity government that would include @entity4 or @entity5			0
at this point , it appears more likely that the parties will fail to form a coalition and @entity2 will be led down the treacherous path to new elections in june			1
this would entail a delay in the adoption of a new package of spending cuts , which in turn will mean that the next installment of the loan , due in august and worth up to 29 billion euros , will also be set back			0
a political stalemate will delay both recapitalization of the @entity2 banks and repayment of more than 6 billion euros owed by the government to private contractors			2
the consequence is that @entity2 businesses , including healthy ones , will be deprived of much - needed oxygen			2
in a country that is in its fifth consecutive year of recession and with an economy expected to shrink by more than 5 % this year , this mess will cause any green shoots of recovery to wilt and die			0
however , the victory of @entity118 in the @entity120 presidential election has sent a breeze of hope throughout the euro zone			0
many expect , perhaps too optimistically , that @entity120 's new leader will convince @entity126 of @entity127 to temper her obsession with austerity in the @entity131 economy			0
it is hoped that she may give her consent to the issuing of euro bonds to promote infrastructure investment , complement the recently agreed fiscal compact with pro-growth measures and perhaps , less realistically , accept a plan to allow the @entity140 to lend directly to fiscally troubled countries			0
from @entity2 's vantage point , these are positive developments			0
but they will all be for naught unless the @entity2 political system can form a viable government that will implement the commitments it has undertaken -- properly amended in ways that @entity2 and its lenders can agree on -- and set the foundations for the transformation of the @entity2 economy to allow it to benefit from any improvement in @entity131 's prospects			1
it is a tall order			0
and @entity2 politicians have shown little evidence of their ability to shoulder it			1
but the future prosperity of @entity2 , as well as the stability of the @entity162 , depends on their success			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity166 and @entity167 .			1

parliamentary election in @entity2 delivered a crushing blow to the two dominant political parties
@entity166 and @entity167 : expect uncertainty and frustration
@entity166 , @entity167 : if parties fail to form coalition , businesses , economy will suffer
they say that the future of @entity2 depends on the ability of its politicians to come together
