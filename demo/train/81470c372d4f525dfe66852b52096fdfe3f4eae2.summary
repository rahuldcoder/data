@entity0 -- @entity4 's government will offer transportation and other assistance to those in a buffer zone around the stricken @entity10 nuclear plant , a top official said friday , noting these people have been put in a " difficult " situation			1
chief cabinet secretary @entity13 said authorities are encouraging people living between 20 and 30 kilometers ( 12.5 and 19 miles ) from the plant to leave the area voluntarily because of the challenges they " have faced in their daily lives			1
" those who live closer already have been ordered to evacuate because of dangerously high levels of radiation			2
a primary challenge for that region , he said , has had to do with commerce -- namely , the difficulty in getting needed materials in and out of the area			0
this is not a mandatory evacuation , @entity13 said			0
still , he said , he could not rule out future mandatory evacuations if radiation rises to unsafe levels			0
other nations , including the @entity36 and @entity37 , have urged their citizens to stay 80 kilometers ( 50 miles ) or more away from the embattled power plant over radiation concerns			2
@entity4 has urged those within a 20 - kilometer radius to evacuate and those within 30 kilometers to try and stay indoors			1
still , even those well outside the plant area are being affected by the radioactive emissions			0
traces of radioactive iodine tied to the plant have been detected as far away as @entity50 and the @entity36			2
authorities have said those levels are far below what 's considered harmful to humans			0
two @entity4 citizens -- one from @entity59 and the other from @entity61 , both 200 kilometers or further from @entity10 -- traveling to @entity57 were taken to a hospital after showing exceedingly high levels of radiation , @entity57 's state - run @entity56 news agency reported			1
a spokesman for @entity4 's embassy in @entity57 said friday that the two are " fine " having left the hospital and joined their tour group			1
" abnormal radiation " was also detected earlier on a @entity4 ship , @entity56 said			1
but in @entity4 , radioactive materials detected in water , food and elsewhere have had a major impact			1
the number of banned food items is growing regularly , and has affected not only consumers , but farmers who rely on the products to make a living			0
one chief concern is the presence of radioactive substances in tap water			0
four sites in @entity87 showed radiation levels above what is considered safe for babies to drink , according to government data released friday			1
the affected facilities provide water for residents in the cities of @entity96 and @entity97			2
the results , from samples taken on thursday , showed between a low of 119 becquerels of radioactive iodine per kilogram of water to a high of 230 becquerels of the same radioactive substance			2
anything higher than that 100 becquerels is considered unsafe for infants under 1 year old , though the levels remain under the 300 becquerel threshold for adults			0
@entity0 's waterworks bureau reported friday , based on tests conducted that morning , that there were 51 becquerels of radioactive iodine per kilogram of tap water			1
the previous day , @entity0 gov. @entity114 lifted the previously announced recommendation that babies not drink tap water after tests from tuesday night showed levels of radiation more than twice the limit for babies			1
there was also positive news in the @entity125 friday , where all five water treatment facilities had levels of radioactive iodine less than 100 becquerels per kilogram of tap water			2
the previous day , two plants in @entity125 had reported high levels			1
the fate of @entity4 's fishing industry is also a hot topic , given fears that spreading radiation might poison fish or scare off customers			2
the @entity140 , which operates the @entity10 plant , said its latest readings from thursday morning show levels of radioactive iodine 104 times higher than normal in the waters 330 meters off the facility 's nos. 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 reactors			1
" i do n't know when this will end , " said @entity149 , 75 , a fisherman from @entity0			0
people do n't want to buy fish because they 're afraid of radiation			0
" still , this is marked progress compared to the previous day 's reading , when levels were 147 times higher than normal			1
the latest results also showed levels of the radioactive iodine were 28 times normal some 10 kilometers south of the plant and 13 times higher about 16 kilometers away			1
agriculture in @entity4 has also been threatened in this crisis , with tests showing radioactive materials at levels exceeding legal limits in 12 types of vegetables grown near the nuclear plant , according to the nation 's health ministry			2
prime minister @entity174 has also asked @entity87 to suspend shipments of raw milk and parsley , according to @entity13			0
the government of @entity179 has asked residents not to eat leafy vegetables			0
and on friday , a @entity57 government agency posted on its website that it had banned dairy products , vegetables , fruits and acquatic animals and products from the @entity4 prefectures of @entity10 , @entity190 , @entity191 , @entity87 and @entity125			1
they join several other countries , including the @entity36 , in prohibiting the import of certain food products from @entity4			0
radiation levels in the food would not cause health problems right away , @entity13 said , but if they rise , they may reach levels risky to human health			0
the decision to prohibit produce sales is another potentially devastating blow to a part of northeast @entity4 hit by the earthquake and tsunami			0
@entity179 ranks among @entity4 's top producers of fruits , vegetables and rice			0
@entity87 , south of @entity10 , supplies @entity0 with a significant amount of fruits and vegetables , and is the third - largest pork producer in the nation .			1

new : two @entity4 hospitalized in @entity57 *due* to radiation are " fine , " a spokesman says
high radiation is detected in @entity87 water ; water safe in @entity0 , @entity125
radiation in *seawater* is 104 times above normal , a drop from the previous day
an official says @entity4 will provide *shuttles* for those within 20 - to - 30 km of the plant
