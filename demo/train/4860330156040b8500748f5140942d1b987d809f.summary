-- in beating a hasty retreat from @entity3 , their onetime lonesome cowboy icon , republicans have resorted to a familiar tactic : divert , deny , distract			1
divert attention by claiming the " media " made a story out of @entity3			1
the " media " plucked him out of obscurity , baited him with questions about race , and then blew the story out of proportion			2
deny having defended , supported and promoted @entity3 -- despite the recorded evidence -- with faux outrage and feigned offense			1
divert by talking about how much the only racism left in @entity21 is the talk about racism			2
that 's one of the points @entity27 makes in her op - ed attacking @entity0 for its coverage of @entity3 and his self - declared " @entity30			1
" but sticking our fingers in our ears and saying " i ca n't hear you " did n't make problems go away when we were 5 - year - olds on a playground			2
and saying that if we just stop talking about race , there wo n't be any racial bias , does n't make it so			2
look , i get it			2
talking about the racial reality in @entity21 makes some powerful people uncomfortable			2
it shows in chief justice @entity47 ' argument that a nonexistent colorblindness justifies the @entity50 's gutting of affirmative action and the @entity52			0
most @entity21 are n't hateful , and many who are , like @entity3 , do n't see themselves in the mirror			1
but there 's still a racial bias in this country that holds back talented @entity21 who are n't white			0
what justice @entity58 said about the judiciary applies to all of us			0
if we believe in the guarantee of equal protection , then " we ought not sit back and wish away , rather than confront , the racial inequality that exists in our society			0
" " wishing away " leads to a denial , and denial of history is , unfortunately , part of @entity27 's appeal to history			0
yes , president @entity72 was a @entity73 , but a hundred years later the @entity73 was n't @entity72 's			1
@entity74 became president by courting americans upset by integration , intentionally fueling the racial divide			0
in his first speech after winning the @entity73 nomination in 1980 , @entity80 , said he believed " in states ' rights			1
" this at the @entity87 , just a few miles from @entity83 , @entity84 , where three civil rights workers were murdered			0
in 2005 , @entity89 chairman @entity88 formally apologized for this " @entity90			0
" this would have been great , if only they 'd stopped using it			0
@entity97 of " @entity98 " said pretty much the same thing @entity3 did			1
republicans did n't chastise him			0
in fact , some @entity73 invited " @entity98 " cast members to this year 's @entity102 address to show their support			1
the @entity73 elected officials and their allies supported @entity3 's cause @entity110 © @entity109 ¨ bre with their actions and rhetoric from the beginning			1
before he wondered if " blacks might not be better off as slaves , " @entity3 received support and encouragement from three @entity73 senators , two of them ( @entity116 and @entity117 ) with presidential ambitions			1
@entity122 's @entity73 senator , @entity121 , referred to @entity3 and his supporters as patriots before retracting			1
and then there 's the list of state and local republicans around the country who supported @entity3 , including @entity132 gov. @entity131 , another presidential aspirant			1
@entity3 felt comfortable lecturing a reporter about race and slavery because for weeks he 'd been puffed up by right - leaning media outlets , potential @entity73 presidential candidates , and current @entity73 officeholders			1
that 's why he was even on the media 's radar			0
and speaking of the media , here 's another dot to connect			0
in april , before this most recent controversy sparked , @entity145 mentioned @entity3 458 times			1
@entity147 -- who said @entity3 was a " friend and frequent guest " -- interviewed @entity3 at length , more than a half - dozen times , about his confrontation with the federal government			2
it was all part of a concerted effort to turn a racist welfare rancher into a folk hero			2
why ? @entity157 and others report that " @entity147 receives major funding and large ad buys from @entity162 - affiliated @entity161 and @entity163			0
" that 's significant because the @entity165 and their affiliates want to " transfer control of federal lands to states " so that they can " use the land in whichever way is most profitable to them such as mining , drilling , and other resource extraction			0
" it 's a shame a little racism gets in the way of profits and power grabs			0
that @entity73 eventually got around to denouncing @entity3 's racist , pro-slavery statement , after conspicuous silence , does n't change the fact they have a history of promoting people like @entity97 and @entity3			1
it does n't change the fact that they 're still advocating an agenda fueled by hatred and fear			0
it 's time for @entity73 to stop posing and look in the mirror			2
they ca n't light a fire under a pot and then feign outrage when it boils over .			0
