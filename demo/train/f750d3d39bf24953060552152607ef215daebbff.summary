-- @entity1 successfully defended his @entity3 title in @entity4 sunday despite still feeling the effect of injuries which have derailed his career			1
the @entity8 won the @entity9 at @entity10 and lost a playoff to @entity12 at the 2012 @entity14 masters but injuries ruined his challenge in the majors last season			1
all that was forgotten as he won on home soil for the fourth year running and extended his record of claiming a title on the @entity24 every year for the last five			2
a run of four birdies in the last six holes saw him card a final round 68 for 12 - under , one shot clear of compatriot @entity32 and two ahead of @entity34 @entity33 and third round leader @entity35 of @entity36			1
@entity1 is hoping he can take a well - deserved break and go into the first major of the season in @entity40 in good shape			2
" i 've got three weeks now that i really need to work on my back , " @entity1 told the official @entity24 website			2
" it 's still not 100 per cent			0
luckily this week i did n't have to hit a lot of drivers , but once i get to @entity40 i need to hit driver , " he added			0
@entity48 birdied the final hole to put @entity1 under pressure , but he responded superbly with two birdies of his own to finish			1
" i saw that @entity32 had made birdie on 18 so i knew that second shot was crucial to give myself a good opportunity and i hit it really close , " he said			0
" and then 18 , everyone thinks you just need to make a birdie but around that green it 's not easy and luckily i was far enough past where i could pitch it back into the grain and get it close			0
" behind the title contenders , @entity65 's @entity64 , who has not won on the @entity24 since his 2008 @entity14 @entity67 triumph , came through the field with a 67 to finish tied fifth at nine under .			0
