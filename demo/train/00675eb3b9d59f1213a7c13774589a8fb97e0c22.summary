-- with president @entity3 's approval rating hovering in the low to mid- 40s -- it was 45 % in @entity0 / @entity6 's recent poll -- democrats in tough contests are largely keeping their distance from the president 's tarnished reputation			1
and as @entity13 has drawn closer , those differences have become more pronounced			0
@entity15 opponents are trying harder than ever to link their rivals to the president , forcing @entity7 to visibly distinguish themselves from the @entity18			1
here are seven @entity7 candidates who 've kept @entity3 on the sidelines : 1			1
as the @entity23 challenging the @entity24 's top @entity15 in a state that voted for @entity26 two years ago , @entity21 has been perhaps the most high - profile candidate to keep her distance from @entity3			1
most notably , she refuses to say whether she voted for the president , citing a matter of principle of privacy at the ballot box as her reason for not answering the question			2
she 's been pressed about her support for the president because she 's made a blatant attempt to paint herself as the @entity7 antithesis to the commander in chief			1
" i 'm not @entity3 , " she said in a campaign ad			1
" i disagree with him on guns , coal and the @entity43			0
only 41 % of @entity45 voters sided with @entity3 in 2012 , so @entity44 knows all too well that it 's not a smart strategy to be a champion for the president			1
in fact , he likes to think of himself more as a " thorn			0
" " i 'll be a thorn in his [ posterior ] , " @entity44 told the @entity53			0
" there 's times when i 'm a total thorn , you know , and he does n't appreciate it			2
" last week he admitted he voted for @entity3 but argued that his voting record was irrelevant because " the president 's not relevant " and will be " gone in two years			1
" a limited role for @entity3 in his final campaign and earlier this year he told @entity0 that he does n't need @entity3 to campaign for him in @entity45			1
" i need him to change some of his policies			0
" regardless of how big of a thorn he is , @entity44 has a tough hill to climb to win a second term			2
he barely squeaked out a win in 2008 over then - longtime sen. @entity70 , who at the time was buried in an ethics scandal			0
and a @entity0 / @entity6 poll from early october had @entity73 leading @entity44 , 50 % to 44 %			0
@entity75 was expected to have a smooth ride to re-election until @entity79 rep. @entity79 entered the race in march			0
@entity3 attended a @entity7 fundraiser in @entity82 this summer , with half of the money raised going to @entity75 's campaign			1
but the senator was n't there			0
his staff chalked up the absence to last - minute votes and legislative activity			0
the episode was foreshadowed somewhat when @entity75 refused to answer questions from @entity0 's @entity94 earlier this year over whether he 'd want to campaign with @entity3			1
in another example , @entity75 tried to take a stake out a firm line on airstrikes against @entity99 , saying in september he wo n't give " this president -- or any other president -- a blank check to begin another land war in @entity104			2
@entity105 is running for a second term in a state that voted for @entity3 in 2008 but not in 2012			1
as a result , she 's had to strike a balance between appealing to the pro-obama factions in her state -- mostly concentrated in the college hubs and big cities -- and the more rural parts of @entity106			2
@entity24 math seems impossible to some democrats she exhibited this fine line in august , when she publicly criticized the president over the @entity122 scandal in remarks released ahead of her speech at the @entity126			2
but when he showed up to also speak at the event , she warmly greeted him at the airport			0
last week she reluctantly admitted that the president has n't shown strong leadership			0
and when he visited @entity106 in january , she avoided him entirely			0
@entity133 has tried to paint herself as someone willing to go toe - to - toe with the @entity3 administration , especially when it comes to energy policy			2
she uses her position as chairman of the @entity141 as a major selling point in her campaign , and has sided with @entity15 in pushing for the approval of the @entity145			0
in an ad , she 's seen saying " the administration 's policies are simply wrong when it comes to oil and gas production in this nation			0
" last year @entity133 declined to attend a visit by @entity3 to her state , though she still hitched a ride aboard @entity155 with the president on his way to @entity134			1
@entity158 's @entity15 challenger , @entity160 , ca n't say one sentence without highlighting that @entity158 with @entity3 voted 99 % of the time			1
@entity158 says she 's proud of her record , but she 's still not angling for a visit by the president			2
asked whether she would want him to campaign for her , @entity158 said " we have a lot going on			0
" " i do n't think it makes sense for the president to come to @entity159 , " she continued , while answering the question at the @entity0 / @entity176 debate last week			0
but she 's happily welcomed former president @entity177 , and @entity178 is set to visit this weekend			2
fighting to keep his seat against @entity15 challenger rep. @entity182 , @entity179 has also sought to strike a balance between the politics of his state and on the national level			0
for example , he backs a minimum wage hike that 's on the ballot in @entity180 , but he opposes @entity3 's proposal to raise the federal minimum wage to $ 10.10			1
like other vulnerable @entity24 candidates -- such as @entity158 , @entity75 and @entity105 -- @entity179 has also called for travel restrictions to help prevent @entity194 from spreading to the @entity195 , a policy the @entity3 administration has not pushed			1
@entity179 made headlines earlier this month when he sounded unsure of how to answer a question about @entity3 's handling of the @entity194 situation .			1

@entity7 candidates in tough races are trying to keep president @entity3 at arm 's length
many of those candidates are fighting in largely red states
