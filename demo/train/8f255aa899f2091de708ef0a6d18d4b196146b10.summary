-- a line of sailors teeter on the edge of a giant yacht , peering down at the blazing orange island reflected on its lurching hull			2
the sailboat slices through the gray @entity8 , passing the @entity10 island of @entity11 at just the right moment to catch a dazzling silhouette on its exposed underbelly			2
it 's an incredible image , captured by @entity17 photographer @entity16 as he leaned out of a low - flying helicopter during the @entity19 earlier this year			1
@entity16 has just been named winner of the prestigious @entity22 competition in @entity23 , @entity24 , chosen from an elite pool of internationally renowned sailing photographers			1
@entity16 said of the winning picture : " the weather had been bad all day , but the sun suddenly came out for a short while			1
" " we were leaving the area but i asked the pilot of the helicopter to fly back briefly over the leading boat -- that 's when i took this photograph			0
" veteran racing photographer @entity38 said the image would have been impossible 20 years ago , as film cameras would have struggled to capture a yacht racing so quickly with the same stunning level of clarity			2
" the reflection at twilight in the hull was interesting			0
but the importance of the crew creates a second point of interest , " he said of the lauded image			0
the fifth annual competition , sponsored by @entity54 , is only open to professional photographers , this year attracting 46 of the best racing images from 2012			1
the spectacular photos captured some of the biggest events in the sailing calendar , from brutal waves bombarding competitors in the @entity63 to the festive atmosphere of the @entity65			2
competitors were judged on technical elements such as clarity , lighting , composition , and also originality			1
" if you look at the images , hardly any could be taken by someone who 's not heavily involved in the industry , " @entity72 , one of the organizers of the event , said			0
" very often you have to be hanging out of a helicopter with no door or on board the racing boat in extremely violent conditions			0
it 's also an investment to have the right equipment that can withstand the salt water			0
" the impressive images were whittled down to the top five by delegates from the @entity22			0
the difficult task of choosing a winner was then decided by a panel of industry heavyweights			0
judges included two - time sailing olympic gold medalist and @entity97 broadcaster @entity96			1
