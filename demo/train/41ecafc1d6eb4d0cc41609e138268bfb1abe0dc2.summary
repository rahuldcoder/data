-- the ex-wife of a @entity3 convict executed in 2004 for the deaths of his three children reaffirmed her belief in his guilt wednesday as his relatives sought to open a new inquiry into the case			2
the family of @entity14 has asked a judge to posthumously clear his name , arguing that he was put to death based on " junk science			1
" though @entity14 was executed in 2004 for killing his three daughters by setting fire to his house , subsequent investigations by outside experts have concluded that the fire that killed the girls should not have been ruled arson			2
@entity14 's ex-wife , @entity27 , has kept a low profile throughout the debate over his execution			1
but she told reporters outside the @entity33 courthouse in @entity34 that " i am here to make sure that my daughters ' voices are heard			0
" " @entity38 murdered @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity41			1
he burnt them , " she said			0
" he admitted he burnt them to me , and he was convicted for his crime			0
that is the closest to justice that my daughters will ever get			0
" @entity27 spoke before an @entity34 judge opened a hearing into the @entity14 's family 's request for an inquiry into the execution			1
but inside the courtroom , prosecutors from the town of @entity56 -- where the 1991 fire took place -- forced a delay in the proceedings by challenging the impartiality of district judge @entity63 and asking him to recuse himself			2
@entity63 told lawyers he will issue a decision on that request next week , said @entity67 , a lawyer representing @entity14 's stepmother , @entity69 , and cousin @entity70			1
@entity67 pointed out that @entity27 has told differing stories about whether her former husband ever admitted his guilt in the fatal fire , and criticized death - penalty supporters for " parading her on the courthouse steps while they 're inside trying to stop proceedings			1
" " what possible harm could there be to their side to have this aired in court ? " he asked			0
also representing the family is @entity87 , led by nationally known defense lawyer @entity88			0
@entity89 , the district attorney for @entity90 , which includes @entity56 , did not return a phone call seeking comment wednesday			0
in asking @entity63 to open a " court of inquiry " into the execution , @entity14 's family argues that he was put to death for a crime " that modern science reveals may never have been committed			1
" state officials failed to act on evidence of " significant deficiencies " in the finding of arson at the heart of the case before the execution , and have " continued to resist attempts to clear mr. @entity14 's name , " their petition states			1
" if we can get a hearing before him or any other fair judge , we 're going to go ahead , " @entity67 said			0
the @entity113 is investigating claims that state fire marshals ruled the fatal blaze arson based on outdated or faulty science			0
the first of three reports to reach that conclusion was sent to gov. @entity122 's office and submitted to appeals courts before @entity14 's execution , while two others were conducted after his death			1
" despite overwhelming scientific evidence , state officials have continued to demonize mr. @entity14 and defend the arson evidence on which he and others have been convicted , " the family 's petition states			1
the @entity113 was to hear from the author of the most recent of those reports in october 2009			0
but the panel 's deliberations were put off after @entity122 -- who allowed the execution to go forward -- abruptly shook up the panel , spurring complaints from the @entity14 family and allegations that @entity122 was trying to head off the potential admission that @entity3 had put an innocent man to death			1
in july , the commission found that arson investigators used flawed science but were not negligent and did not commit misconduct			0
a spokeswoman for the governor 's office told @entity0 on tuesday that @entity122 , who allowed the execution to go forward , remains convinced of @entity14 's guilt			2
and @entity56 authorities have said that evidence beyond the testimony of state fire marshals supported @entity14 's conviction			2
@entity0 's @entity160 contributed to this report .			0

" @entity38 murdered @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity41 , " @entity27 says
challenge to judge delays new effort to clear dead man 's name
