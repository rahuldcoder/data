-- another week has passed for the world 's most popular sport			2
another week of brawls , scandal and allegations of racist abuse which has left the football 's lawmakers grappling as to how best to tackle discrimination			2
on tuesday , @entity11 's under - 21 match with @entity12 was overshadowed by ugly fighting and alleged racist chants directed at @entity15 , an incident that led to calls from leading figures within the @entity20 game to ban the @entity22 country from international football			1
not that @entity11 could in any way claim the higher moral ground as two days later former @entity11 captain @entity26 decided against appealing his four - match ban and $ 356,000 fine for racially abusing @entity28			2
that punishment raised questions about the even handedness of the @entity32 given @entity34 striker @entity33 was banned for eight matches and fined $ 64,000 for comments he made to @entity39 's @entity38 in october 2011			1
back in @entity42 on thursday , @entity41 governing body @entity40 decided to hand @entity43 a $ 52,000 fine for racist chanting by their fans during a match with @entity49			1
it is against this backdrop of abuse , bans and fines that @entity56 striker @entity55 launched his own protest against what he perceives to be a lack of action by anti-racism group @entity62			1
on saturday , before @entity56 's match with @entity34 , the @entity64 striker will refuse to wear a t - shirt displaying the logo of the anti-racism organization			1
with the @entity20 seemingly fissuring over how best to tackle racism , former @entity71 striker @entity70 questioned @entity55 ' boycott and called for a united front in the continued fight against discrimination			1
" if we are going to fight racism , we can only do it by being united , " said @entity70 , who played in @entity11 's top flight for @entity77 having previously playing @entity78 and @entity79			2
" having different parties will only give more power to the racists , which is n't what we want to achieve			0
" it is rumored other black players may follow @entity55 ' lead , while @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity92 and @entity93 confirmed their players will wear the t - shirts			1
" i know that just wearing a t - shirt is not going to make a difference , without action nothing is going to happen , " continued @entity70			1
" so i can agree with @entity55 , but one solution suggested by the @entity62 chairman @entity100 is for them to have more independence and more power , so they can have a bigger say			1
" it is unfortunate we have had two very high - profile incidents , " added @entity70 , referring to the cases involving @entity26 and @entity33 , " but i can speak from my own experience -- @entity11 is winning the battle against racism			0
" @entity39 defender @entity113 has been unwavering in his support of his younger brother @entity115 , but his manager @entity116 questioned @entity55 ' planned action			1
" i have to disagree with @entity55			2
i think he is making the wrong point , " said the @entity119 coach			0
" everyone should be united , with all the players in the country wearing the kick it out warm - up tops			0
" i do n't know what point he is trying to make			0
i do n't know if he is trying to put himself on a different pedestal from everyone			0
but he really should be supporting all the rest of the players who are doing it			0
" when you do something , and everyone believes in it , you should all do it together			0
there should n't be sheep wandering off			0
i think he is making the wrong message			0
all the players are wearing it			0
" former @entity146 and @entity147 player @entity70 outlined how a lot of the efforts made by organizations like @entity62 have slipped under the radar			1
" we have seen firsthand the amount of work they are doing behind the scenes at the moment , " continued the 30 - year - old , who runs a company which aims to help integrate foreign players who move to @entity11			2
" they are listening to what is being said by different black players and i can guarantee a lot is being doing done at the moment , " added @entity70 , who retired earlier this year after a playing career which included spells with @entity147 and @entity146			0
" they promote education , mentoring , inclusion and equality across different cultures			0
i have been talking to them about improving the integration of foreign players into a country and providing them a level of support			0
" the t - shirt gesture that @entity55 is not going to participate in is part of @entity62 's annual awareness raising drive which is aimed at highlighting the work it has done to rid football of discrimination			1
@entity40 and @entity62 's fellow anti-racism group @entity189 will also use the @entity190 and @entity191 matches on tuesday , wednesday and thursday to spread a message of tolerance and unity .			1

@entity56 's @entity55 will refuse to wear an anti-racism groups t - shirt
