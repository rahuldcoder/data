-- five - time @entity2 winner @entity1 has backed world number three @entity3 to emerge victorious this year			1
@entity1 , who won 15 majors between 1974 and 1981 , is confident the six - time champion can overcome holder @entity7 , in - form @entity9 and fourth seed @entity11 at the @entity13 tournament			1
the @entity14 cited @entity3 's form during the recent @entity16 at @entity17 , where the @entity18 lost to the @entity19 @entity7 in the final , as the reason behind his prediction			2
" i pick @entity3 because the way he played the @entity16			0
i have never seen @entity3 play better clay court tennis than he did in @entity25			0
@entity11 's @entity2 mission will not succeed in 2011 " @entity3 is a mentally strong person , so when he 's coming to one of his favorite surfaces , grass , i think it 's going to be very difficult to beat him at @entity2			1
" although @entity1 tipped the 29 - year - old @entity3 to shine , the former world number one would not be surprised if top seed @entity7 , @entity32 winner @entity9 or home - crowd favorite @entity11 clinched the title			1
" you have four guys right now , they are playing incredible tennis and i think everybody 's very confident for the moment			0
i pick @entity3 , but anyone can win			2
" @entity7 equaled @entity1 's record of six @entity16 triumphs with his victory over 16 - time major champion @entity3 earlier this month , and the 55 - year - old said he has enjoyed watching the pair 's rivalry develop over the last few years			1
" my two favorite players are @entity3 and @entity7			2
i 've only missed one match of all the matches they have played			0
they are a little bit different , different personalities , different styles			0
" they produced tennis like ex-players want to see and people want to see , and they always play great tennis			0
" @entity0 's @entity59 presenter and former @entity2 champion @entity58 disagrees with @entity1 , and thinks @entity7 will retain his crown			1
" i 've got to say the number one player in the world			0
i think all four players ( @entity7 , @entity9 , @entity3 and @entity11 ) have got a great chance , all four top players			1
" but if i had to say one i 'd have to say the number one player in the world who has just won the @entity16 , @entity7			2
" @entity70 became the youngest - ever champion of the grass court grand slam in 1985 , aged 17 , and the @entity74 agrees with @entity1 that @entity3 can record a seventh @entity2 crown			1
but the three - time winner at @entity77 can not pick a winner out of the tournament 's top four seeds			1
" i would agree with @entity1 in a sense that a six - time @entity2 champion can win it seven times			1
" i do n't think there is a clear - cut favorite this year			0
normally you would go with the defending champion , but @entity3 is the most talented of all of them			2
" you have @entity11 , the great hope of @entity90 , and you have @entity9 , the player of the year losing only one tennis match			0
i want to see the first week , how everybody does in their first couple of matches , then i can give you a name			0
