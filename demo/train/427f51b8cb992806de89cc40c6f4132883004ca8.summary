as @entity2 thieves steal smartphones and tablets in ever greater numbers , the @entity0 has assigned a group of officers to hunt down the devices			1
the @entity0 launched the team about a year ago " when we saw a spike in ( thefts of ) @entity14 products specifically , " deputy commissioner @entity9 said			1
an @entity14 - picking problem on @entity2 's streets and subways has worsened in recent years			1
the overall crime rate in the city increased 3 % last year -- but " if you subtracted just the increase in @entity14 product thefts , we would have had an overall decrease in crime in @entity2 , " @entity18 said			1
generally , the @entity0 team 's first step in tracing pilfered gadgets is obtaining the stolen device 's serial number			1
then " we supply it to @entity14 , and we say , when that product is activated , we want to know who it is , " according to @entity18			1
the tech giant has largely cooperated with the @entity0 's subpoenas			2
" i would say we 're working with them			0
they 're not fighting this , " @entity18 said			0
@entity14 did not respond to a request for comment			2
the @entity0 's detectives have found that stolen smartphones and tablets do n't tend to travel far			1
about 75 % of them stay in the city of @entity2 , @entity18 said			2
and those that cross city limits are still likely to be in the state			0
@entity18 did not quantify how successful the department has been at tracing stolen smartphones and tablets , but he did cite a few cases that had happy endings			2
in one , an employee stole three @entity58 from his workplace , then gave them to two relatives in @entity2 and one in the @entity62			0
the @entity0 was able to return all three to their rightful owners			0
sometimes the trail leads back to the person who swiped the @entity66 ; other times it leads to an unwitting owner of stolen property			0
while the officers on the @entity0 's smartphone squad do n't focus exclusively on @entity14 products , they do spend most of their time chasing stolen iphones or @entity58 , " simply because the number of @entity14 thefts is a reflection of their general popularity , " @entity18 said			1
law - enforcement agencies like the @entity0 are n't alone in targeting smartphone and tablet theft			1
the industry is taking steps to address it , too			0
in a letter to the chairman of the @entity91 , the wireless industry 's trade association last year released details of a voluntary effort to " help law enforcement deter smartphone theft			0
" a major plank of that effort is the creation of a database for smartphones that are reported stolen			0
phones on the database , which is scheduled to be up and running at the end of november , would be barred being activated or provided service on an lte network in the @entity104 .			0

@entity0 official says small crime increase in @entity2 would have *dipped* without @entity14 thefts
