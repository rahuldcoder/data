@entity0 , @entity1 -- a key member of an insurgent network in the @entity7 - @entity1 region has been seized recent days , @entity1 military intelligence sources told @entity2 on friday			1
he is @entity9 , son of @entity7 insurgent leader @entity10 , whose notorious group , called the @entity12 , operates in @entity7 and @entity1 and is closely tied to the @entity13			1
@entity9 was detained in recent days while driving from @entity15 to the tribal region of @entity17 , the sources said			1
the @entity18 says he is believed to be based out of @entity19 in @entity17 , where the network operates			1
the @entity1 military intelligence sources asked not to be named because they are not authorized to speak to the media			1
this arrest comes amid concerns among @entity25 officials that @entity1 has not been aggressively confronting militants operating in the tribal regions			1
the @entity12 " has been at the forefront of insurgent activity in @entity7 , responsible for many high - profile attacks , " the @entity18 says			1
@entity31 , managing editor of @entity32 , a website that tracks terror - related events and trends , calls the top leadership a " family business			2
" the @entity18 says it consists of @entity10 's three oldest sons , one of whom is @entity9 , who operates as an emissary for the network and spends a lot of time fundraising , the @entity18 says			1
he apparently speaks arabic and is a close aide to his father , the @entity18 says			2
his brother , @entity48 , is described by the @entity49 as the overall leader of the network and the leader of the @entity53			1
the @entity18 says the @entity12 is believed to have three main sources of funds : @entity57 region donations , drug trafficking , and @entity60 payments			1
" in 2004 , ( @entity9 ) @entity10 traveled to @entity61 with a @entity13 associate to raise funds for the @entity13			1
he also provided funds in 2004 to militants in @entity7 for the purpose of disrupting the @entity7 presidential election			2
" from at least 2005 to 2008 , @entity9 collected funds for the @entity12 through various fundraising trips , including during regular travel to the @entity71 in 2007 and through a fundraising trip to another @entity57 state in 2008 , " the @entity18 said			1
and late last year , @entity9 " received several hundred thousand dollars from @entity60 - associated individuals in the @entity76 " for network activities			1
earlier this year , the @entity25 @entity49 cited @entity9 for supporting acts of terrorism			1
@entity80 was designated a supporter of terrorism in 2008			2
many observers say the @entity17 - based group has backing in the @entity1 military			2
" elements within the @entity1 security establishment continue to view the @entity12 as a useful ally and proxy force to represent their interests in @entity7			2
to this end , @entity10 forces have repeatedly targeted @entity97 infrastructure and construction projects in @entity7 , " the @entity91 said in a report this year			2
" the @entity99 has consistently refused to launch a military operation in @entity17 despite the presence of @entity60 senior leadership , " it said			0
a report published earlier this year by the @entity104 think tank calls the @entity1 agency of @entity17 " the most important springboard for violence in @entity7 today , much as it has been for decades			0
" and it says the @entity12 is " the most important militant group " in @entity17 's @entity19 , where @entity10 settled in the mid- 1970s after leaving his native @entity110 in @entity7			0
" @entity10 quickly became the most important mujahedeen commander in eastern @entity7 during the 1980s " when @entity7 fighters took on the @entity113 , the report says			0
@entity17 has been a " safe haven " for militants eluding @entity25 and @entity1 military actions , it notes			0
" shortly after the fall of the @entity13 regime in @entity7 in late 2001 , thousands of @entity13 members associated with the regime flooded into @entity17 , " according to the report , titled " @entity122 : @entity17			0
" " many took shelter in ( @entity17 's ) treacherous and heavily forested @entity125 , which became a refuge for all sorts of foreign militants , including those from @entity60			0
@entity1 government forces subsequently targeted other @entity1 safe havens , including @entity132			0
in 2004 , a wave of militants arrived in @entity17 after being pushed out of @entity132 's @entity135			0
more recently , a variety of militants associated with the @entity138 in @entity132 is believed to have sought safe haven in @entity17			0
" will the arrest make an impact in the war against the @entity13 ? @entity31 doubts it			0
he says the @entity12 are one of the @entity1 state 's premier proxies and puts them on par with @entity148 , the @entity1 - based group that was blamed for a violent siege on @entity150 in november 2008			0
he notes that there has been pressure to appease and deflect pressure from the @entity25 and @entity154			0
" when the heat gets turned up , " he said , @entity1 will make a gesture but " not a real sacrifice			0
" @entity2 's @entity158 , @entity159 and @entity160 contributed to this report			0

@entity9 was seized in recent days
he was arrested while driving to the tribal region from @entity15
the son is a key fundraiser for the network
