-- is it a guitar ? is it a piano ? nope , it is a crazy @entity6 - powered combination of both			1
plus it has a built in bass , violin and drum machine to boot			1
the @entity12 1 looks something like a medieval lute , but with a smart phone jammed into its belly			1
the new instrument , released for pre-order this month , combines a keyboard , fret board , built - in plectrum and accelerometer - powered wawa effect			2
named the @entity12 1 , it is the invention of @entity24 , a ph.d. in sound studies , from @entity27 the @entity28 draws on the computational power of a modern smart phone to make and record sound			1
a downloadable app on the phone allows you to select different modes , helping you to change swiftly between instruments			0
@entity24 says the invention of the @entity12 came to him at a dinner party in his native @entity39 that descended into a late - night @entity6 - based jam session			1
" it was a bit comical , " @entity24 says , " the singers staring down in their lap at the phone , fingers and hands contorted around a device that just begged to be dropped , trying to tap the right notes to songs we could have instantly played on a normal keyboard or guitar			1
" it was then that i had the idea of a multi-instrument that would adapt to each person 's playing technique and musical style			0
this was n't a guitar or a violin or a keyboard but it could be any of them			1
" @entity24 says that he finds contemporary digital instruments such as keyboards , drum machines and laptops boring , so he invented his own device			2
" i wanted to make something that people at all skill levels could play , a device as agnostic to musical style as the piano but as expressive as a violin			1
" the instrument 1 is made out of bamboo and hardwoods , and is produced by @entity39 - based woodworkers			2
the speaker grilles are made of polished aluminum and the entire device is assembled locally			0
@entity24 says it was important to him that the instrument should be high quality in its construction and materials : " i want to make instruments with innovative technologies that people want to keep and pass on rather than toss when they are obsolete , " he says			1
showcased at the @entity94 and the @entity95 , @entity24 hopes the @entity96 will be embraced by working musicians			0
" i 'd like to put the @entity12 1 in @entity99 's hands , since he 's broken so many barriers in electronic music throughout his career , " says @entity24			1
" and @entity103 , because they 're beyond obsessive about tone ... but i 'm probably most excited about the whizkid in @entity107 who 's going to post some killer video on @entity110 and blow our minds			0
" the invention of new musical instruments has always come from technological leaps			0
the modern piano was a byproduct of mechanical development in the 18th century , and the electric guitar evolved from amplification experiments being done by big bands in the early 1900s			0
the release of the @entity123 coincides with the 30th anniversary of @entity125 , a 1983 innovation that many musicians regard as the birth of electronic music			0
@entity130 , editor in @entity131 says the instrument 1 " seems like a high - end take on the @entity133 idea , where the fingerboard is replaced by touch switches ... though as a guitar player myself , physical strings feel much more natural than virtual strings			2
how widely it is accepted remains to be seen but i 'm always encouraged to see new instrument ideas make it into the market and this one certainly looks to be well engineered			2
" in 2008 the @entity144 was established to showcase and recognize the invention of new musical instruments			0
commenting on the @entity12 1 , @entity145 , organizer of the competition and director of the @entity148 , said : " in general , i 'm a big believer in using the capabilities of smart phones to power novel hardware			1
the ' brain ' of such devices is already in your pocket , so why not use it ? " specifically regarding the @entity12 , i think they did a very good job in providing a wide variety of gestural input that can allow for more musical expression than interacting with the @entity162			2
my only concern is that these new input modalities are still far from providing the expression that acoustic instruments can provide			0
but as long as users know what to expect , this can definitely be fun to play			0
" so how does it sound ? according to @entity24 , the instrument " can sound like anything you want			0
" so if you are in the market for a harp that plays like a violin and looks like a space - age guitar , @entity12 's new instrument 1 may be the one instrument for you			1
@entity180 contributed to this story			0

@entity12 1 can be played as a guitar , harp , violin , drum machine or keyboard
the instrument draws on the computational power of an @entity6 , housed *beneath* its *fretboard*
" i wanted to make something that people at all skill levels could play , " says *creator*
