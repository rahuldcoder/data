a nervy @entity0 returned to winning ways saturday with a 2 - 0 victory over mid-table @entity4 at the @entity5			1
goals from @entity8 international midfielder @entity7 and @entity10 striker @entity9 either side of half - time were enough to secure the three points , although @entity4 will feel aggrieved not to have taken anything from the game			1
the @entity16 put their more illustrious hosts under pressure for long spells and were unfortunate not to level matters at the beginning of the second period when midfielder @entity23 cracked a post			0
real goalkeeper @entity25 then made a flying save from @entity28 moments later			0
after a 4 - 0 derby thrashing at the hands of city rivals @entity32 last weekend , @entity0 manager @entity29 will be content to return to winning ways			1
however , the @entity34 will also be concerned at the often scrappy nature of his side 's play and the relatively timid performance of star - man @entity40 who failed to score for his third @entity43 game running -- the first time he has done so since 2013			1
@entity40 came in for criticism from some @entity0 supporters earlier in the week after holding his 30th birthday party in the wake of last saturday 's derby humiliation			1
the world player of the year did set up @entity9 for @entity0 's second and struck the bar in the first half , but he was quiet for long periods and missed from two - yards out when presented with a golden opportunity shortly before @entity7 opened the scoring			1
speaking after the game , @entity29 said " it was a difficult week and we have come out of it with a victory which is good , " in quotes carried by the @entity59 news agency " the team was a bit worried at the start , but in the end it went well			2
the fans have helped us and they understood the moment the team is going through to help us come out of this quickly			0
" @entity0 and @entity40 will be hoping for a more convincing performance when they face @entity73 in the last 16 of the @entity74 on wednesday			1
saturday 's result moves @entity0 four points clear atop the @entity43 table although this will be cut back to one point if second placed @entity80 beats @entity81 at the @entity82			2
round five of the @entity83 meant there was no @entity86 action this weekend			0
there was , however , two all top - flight cup ties saturday			2
@entity89 comfortably overcame @entity90 4 - 0 , thanks to a brace from the in - form @entity93 and further strikes from @entity96 and @entity97 , while @entity98 came from behind to defeat @entity99 2 - 1 at @entity100			1
in saturday 's other cup fixtures , @entity86 @entity101 was thrashed 4 - 1 by second - tier @entity103			2
meanwhile , @entity105 striker @entity104 scored the winning goal as @entity107 defeated @entity108 in an all @entity110 affair			0
an injury hit @entity112 missed the chance to go top of @entity115 after drawing 2 - 2 at home to @entity117			2
the reigning @entity10 champions had forged ahead thanks to goals from @entity120 and @entity121 but came undone when injuries forced @entity123 and @entity124 off the park			0
manager @entity126 had used all three substitutions meaning @entity112 were forced to play the last 10 minutes with nine men			0
although they held on for the majority of that time the @entity129 conceded goals in the 89th and then 92nd minute to @entity132 and @entity133 respectively to ensure the spoils were shared			0
the result leaves @entity112 in third place behind @entity137 , which drew with @entity138 on friday , and table - topping @entity140 which heads to fc @entity141 sunday .			0
