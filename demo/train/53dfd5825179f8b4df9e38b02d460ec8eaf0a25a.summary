-- @entity3 must serve a year of probation after being convicted on check fraud charges , a @entity2 appeals court ruled tuesday			1
@entity8 can not " take advantage " of an administrative error to avoid serving the 2010 sentence , the appeals court ruled			1
the fifth @entity12 's ruling comes a day after @entity2 's attorney general filed a motion in the case			1
attorney general @entity16 argued that a clerical error should not prevent @entity8 from abiding by a judge 's verbal order			1
@entity8 " and her lawyers were well aware that her probationary placement was not to begin until her release from confinement , " the appeals court ruling said			1
@entity8 has been in seclusion since her july acquittal on murder charges in the 2008 death of her 2 - year - old daughter , @entity3 , and her subsequent release from jail			0
@entity8 was convicted of felony check fraud for stealing a checkbook from a friend and writing five checks for $ 644.25			2
a judge sentenced her in that case in january 2010			0
@entity40 chief judge @entity39 ruled earlier this month that she had to report for probation on the bad - check charge by friday			0

@entity40 circuit judge @entity65 had earlier ordered @entity8 to serve a year of probation after her release in the charges involving her daughter , but a clerk misunderstood the judge and prepared an order that the judge later signed , instructing that @entity8 would serve the probation while in custody awaiting trial			2
the order was updated august 1 to add the words " upon release			0
" but @entity8 's lawyers contended that she could n't be required to serve probation , arguing that she had already served it while in custody under a signed order from @entity65			1
serving the sentence now would violate constitutional protections against having to serve a sentence twice for the same offense , they argued			0
@entity39 ruled earlier this month that @entity65 's verbal order was binding -- a ruling the appeals court upheld tuesday .			0
