@entity3 -- " are @entity1 people bad people ? " forty - year - old @entity5 said that this question from her five - year - old child prompted her to think about what exactly recent television reports were telling everybody			1
in the past week , the @entity12 public has been waking up to images of @entity1 protesters expressing their anger towards @entity12 and its claim over a few uninhabited islands located between the two countries			1
@entity12 calls them the @entity20 , while @entity1 calls them the @entity23 islands			1
anti-japanese protests in @entity1 on symbolic anniversary the @entity12 media showed images of huge crowds throwing bottles and eggs at the @entity12 embassy in @entity32 as they chanted nationalistic slogans			1
television stations also carried lengthy reports from inside a @entity12 - owned mall -- elsewhere in @entity1 -- which was slowly being surrounded by increasingly violent demonstrators			1
though life has continued as normal across @entity12 , many @entity12 people are increasingly troubled by the dispute			2
background : how remote rock split @entity1 , @entity12 " i can understand that the @entity1 are angry at the past , when the @entity12 invaded them and did twisted things to them , but that 's the past , " said 65 - year - old @entity42			1
" @entity12 was also victim of the atomic bomb dropped by the @entity48 , but we do n't constantly reproach them for doing that			2
at that time , it was war			0
" anti-japanese protests in @entity1 are nothing new			2
in 2010 , a collision near the disputed islands in the @entity57 between a @entity1 fishing boat and a @entity12 marine ship soured relations between the two countries after the captain of the @entity1 vessel was briefly detained			1
but they have rarely gone on for so long and become so violent			0
@entity65 , a 22 - year - old college student , said that recent events have pushed him to reconsider plans to travel to @entity1 , and that the protests were " frightening			1
" but @entity65 knows that not all @entity1 people hate the @entity12 because he lives in @entity70 , a city known for its large @entity71 and has @entity1 friends of his own			1
" i think only a handful of radicals are reacting excessively , " @entity65 said			0
" i think there are many people who like @entity12 , so it does not change my views about @entity1 people			1
" many people , such as 26 - year - old @entity81 , suspect that the lack of effective communication between the two countries is causing the rift			0
" my sense is that we have come to this point because we did not talk enough between each other , and we each make our own conclusions , " she said			0
dangerous rocks : can both sides back off peacefully ? though he believes the islands are @entity12 because of " historical written proof , " @entity42 says the current dispute is " absurd , " and that the two countries need to have a serious heart - to - heart to settle things			2
the media has also come under fire for its reporting on the issue			0
" it seems to me that the media only shows us the flashy stuff , " @entity81 said			0
she also suspects that most employees of the damaged businesses in @entity1 are locals , and that they are not all anti-japanese			2
" i think there are people who oppose @entity12 and those who do n't			0
i 'd like to hear what the latter people have to say , " she said			0
ever since @entity5 was surprised by her child 's question , she says she has become more attentive to what is happening			0
" i think many facts about the past are not being reported properly in @entity1 , " she said , while suspecting the same thing in @entity12			2
" there may be some things that we do not know about the past between @entity1 and @entity12			2
maybe it 's because records have not been set straight that we can not understand each other			0
" as for the answer to her young son 's question : " i told him that @entity1 people are not bad people , and that it would be great if we could all get along better			0
" even though @entity137 protests in @entity12 have not been observed on the same scale as in @entity1 , there have been some tensions and a number of minor incidents reported			1
but this may change if the @entity109 backlash continues			1
@entity1 investigating protesters ' hassling of @entity48 ambassador 's car			0

@entity12 public increasingly *concerned* by @entity109 backlash in @entity1
centers on disputed islands known by @entity12 as @entity20 and by @entity1 as @entity23 islands
so far the reaction in @entity12 has been limited to few small - scale protests against @entity1
