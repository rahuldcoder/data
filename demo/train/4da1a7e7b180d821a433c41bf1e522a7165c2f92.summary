@entity0 -- call them " unicorners			0
" a liberal group says it has collected more than 19,000 e-mails requesting @entity6 officials to confirm @entity7 is not a unicorn			2
without such proof , the group @entity9 argues with tongue in cheek , @entity7 may indeed be a unicorn -- his dark mane hiding a horn -- and therefore ineligible to be on the presidential ballot in november			2
the farcical campaign mimics efforts by " birthers , " and some top supporters of certain @entity21 presidential nominee @entity7 , to continually raise the already - settled issue of whether president @entity23 meets the @entity25 's requirements for citizenship			1
@entity7 hits ' magic number ' for @entity21 nomination " i feel like we 've tried logic with the birthers for too long , " @entity9 founder @entity29 said wednesday			1
" now it 's time to take their arguments to the logical extreme to show how absurd they are			0
" while steeped in satire , the unicorn - birther matter touches on deeper issues as @entity23 and @entity7 head into the november campaign			1
since before @entity23 's election in 2008 , some conservatives have questioned whether he was born in the @entity45			2
if not , they said , he was ineligible to serve as president			0
despite conclusive evidence to the contrary , the issue has remained alive , nurtured by the conservative blogosphere and getting raised repeatedly by @entity21 figures			1
@entity52 , whose 2011 crusade to unearth details about @entity23 's origins drew global attention and prompted the @entity57 to release the president 's long - form birth certificate , raised the issue again last week			1
before campaigning with @entity7 on tuesday , @entity52 bristled when told by @entity1 's @entity61 that he was beginning to sound " a little ridiculous " for characterizing the question of where @entity23 was born as a matter of opinion , rather than fact			1
" you are , @entity61 , " @entity52 fired back			0
" let me tell you something , i think you sound ridiculous			0
" @entity61 responds to his @entity52 interview the @entity7 campaign appears anxious to distance itself from the birther issue			1
when asked monday about @entity52 's raising it , @entity7 said he believes @entity23 was born in the @entity45			1
" you know , i do n't agree with all the people who support me , and my guess is , they do n't all agree with everything i believe in , " @entity7 said			2
" but i need to get 50.1 % or more , and i 'm appreciative to have the help of a lot of good people			0
" @entity23 's campaign jumped on that comment , with deputy manager @entity84 issuing a statement tuesday that said @entity7 's " continued embrace of @entity52 and refusal to condemn his disgraceful conspiracy theories demonstrates his complete lack of moral leadership			1
" meanwhile , the @entity7 campaign accused @entity23 supporters of using the issue to distract attention from the high unemployment rate			1
@entity7 surrogate @entity95 , a former @entity96 governor , went further wednesday , accusing @entity1 of deliberately focusing on the birther issue in support of @entity23			1
" why is @entity1 so fixated on this ? why do n't we talk about the jobs issue in this country ? " @entity95 asked after @entity1 's @entity103 raised the birther issue to start an interview			0
" it 's @entity1 that wants to bring it up			0
i do n't want to bring it up			0
@entity7 made it clear that he believes that president @entity23 was born in the @entity45			1
" when @entity103 responded that @entity52 's raising of the birther issue made it a valid question about a possible major contributor to the @entity7 campaign , @entity95 fired back that comedian @entity116 -- known for politically incorrect commentary -- is a @entity118 supporter			1
" the fact is that this country has a jobs problem , and supporters of the president like @entity1 keep wanting to talk about other issues , " @entity95 said			2
pressed on the matter by @entity103 , @entity95 declared , " it 's not an issue			0
there is nobody in the @entity7 campaign that believes that the president was not born in the @entity45			1
the president is born in the @entity45			0
" @entity132 called @entity95 's pronouncement " a good start , " but he called on @entity7 and other @entity21 leaders to make that point directly to birthers to halt what he labeled a racism - tinged attempt to delegitimize the nation 's first @entity140 - @entity45 president			1
" it is the @entity21 grass roots and @entity21 leaders who keep on raising it , " @entity29 said of the birther issue , adding that @entity7 and other @entity21 leaders " refuse to actively push back			1
" " they 're not just saying , ' this is nonsense , and it 's tinged with racism , and it needs to stop , ' " @entity29 said			0
while targeted at @entity7 , the unicorn campaign actually is satirizing last week 's justification by @entity6 secretary of state @entity156 for threatening to bar @entity23 from the november presidential ballot			1
@entity156 , who initially said his office received 1,200 e-mails from @entity160 questioning whether @entity23 was born in @entity161 , said that he was duty - bound to investigate that public concern			1
it did n't matter that the @entity57 last year released @entity23 's long - form birth certificate from @entity161			1
@entity52 and others question whether the document is authentic , and sheriff @entity167 of @entity6 's @entity168 -- known for his tough crackdown on illegal immigrants -- has sent a deputy to @entity161 to check it out			0
@entity156 , a co-chairman of @entity7 's @entity6 campaign , defended the request for proof from @entity161 , telling @entity6 radio station @entity176 last week that " i do n't see anything wrong with verifying something so that as many @entity179 as possible have confidence that the people that appear on the ballot are entitled to be there			1
" " if i embarrassed the state , i apologize , " he said			0
when @entity161 later provided the requested proof , @entity156 announced the matter settled and said @entity23 would be on the ballot in @entity6 as long as he filed all the proper paperwork			2
@entity29 called the episode " asinine , " saying it was the " straw that broke the camel 's back " for inspiring him to launch the @entity7 - unicorn campaign			2
he created a website labeled @entity196 and spread the word using his network 's internet connections on @entity200 and other sites			0
" what about the persistent rumors that @entity7 is in fact , a unicorn ? " the website says , using italics for emphasis			0
" there has never been a conclusive dna test proving that @entity7 is not a unicorn			0
we have never seen him without his hair -- hair that could be covering up a horn			0
" lampooning the logic of birthers , the website says : " no , we can not prove it			0
but we can not prove that it is not the case			0
and if @entity7 is or may be a unicorn , he is not constitutionally qualified to be president			2
" on wednesday , the website said it had more than 19,000 e-mails supporting an investigation by @entity156 into @entity7 's possible unicorn heritage			2
some argue @entity23 was born in @entity231 , not @entity161 , and therefore can not serve as president			1
others focus on the fact that @entity23 's father was not a @entity45 citizen , supposedly rendering his son ineligible for the @entity238			0
earlier this month , the @entity240 state @entity21 wrote a passage into its proposed party platform calling on presidential candidates to " show proof of being a natural - born citizen , " beginning with the 2012 election			2
" there are many @entity21 who feel that @entity23 is not a ' natural - born citizen ' because his father was not an @entity45 when he was born and , therefore , feel that according to the @entity25 he 's not qualified to be president , should not have been allowed to be elected by the @entity255 or even nominated by the @entity118 in 2008 , " @entity247 , chairman of the @entity249 's platform committee , told @entity250			1
in addition , @entity21 @entity257 members from @entity258 , @entity259 and @entity260 have publicly raised questions about @entity23 's citizenship in recent weeks			2
@entity265 chairman @entity264 calls the birther issue a distraction , and @entity95 sought to turn the tables on the matter wednesday by arguing it was the @entity23 campaign seeking to use the topic to distract			1
" i think it 's an effort by the @entity23 administration not to talk about the laws they passed that are strangling specific segments of the @entity45 job market , " @entity95 said			0
to @entity29 , @entity95 " knows in his heart " that the birther discussion " is a losing issue			0
" @entity1 's @entity282 contributed to this report .			0

a campaign to *reveal* " absurd " logic generates more than 19,000 supporters
" @entity291 " ignore evidence that president @entity23 was born in @entity161
@entity21 keep raising the issue even though top @entity21 figures say it is dead
a @entity7 surrogate says @entity118 seek to distract from *jobless* issue
