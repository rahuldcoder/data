-- people keep asking me what my dad might like for his 90th birthday on june 12			1
i think i can answer that one			0
he 'd like to jump out of an airplane and feel that freedom one more time			0
he 'd like to have his family and close friends around him for a quiet celebration			0
he 'd like a good martini with a couple of olives			0
but most of all , i know he 'd like you , on the occasion of his birthday , to give to others			0
volunteer service is @entity23 's true north			1
he made it a centerpiece of his presidency , encouraging millions of people to look within to find " your own special genius for helping others			1
" he gave 1,020 @entity31 from the @entity32 to inspire people to volunteer and to prove that " somewhere in @entity35 , every serious social problem is being solved through voluntary service , for therein lies the greatest national resource of all			1
" in the years since he left the @entity32 , @entity23 joined forces with former president @entity40 to support victims of @entity42 and the @entity44 tsunami -- and the volunteers who showed up afterward to help rebuild			1
opinion : what @entity47 , at 90 , can teach millennials last july , he and @entity49 traveled to the @entity32 to join president @entity50 and @entity51 and hundreds of others in a special ceremony to present the 5,000th @entity54 to an @entity56 couple fighting world hunger one meal at a time			2
so what would he really like for his birthday ? he 'd like you to go to @entity63 and pledge to pitch in			0
as @entity23 said , " it does n't matter who you are			2
everybody 's got something to give : a job skill , a free hour , a pair of strong arms			0
" i hope you 'll volunteer as a way to honor my @entity23 -- or yours ( @entity74 is sunday )			1
or volunteer as a way to be good to yourself ; researchers say it leads to healthier , happier lives			0
whatever your cause , whatever your motivation , i hope you 'll agree with me that volunteer service is an extraordinary gift			1
thanks for everything and happy birthday , @entity23 .			2

his *son* says former president @entity47 wants more than a *skydive* for his 90th
@entity93 : @entity23 wants to continue to encourage people to serve the *community*
he says encouraging volunteer service was a *hallmark* of *41* 's presidency
@entity93 : volunteer as a way to honor my dad -- or yours
