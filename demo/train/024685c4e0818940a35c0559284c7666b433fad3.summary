-- to most owners of the new @entity3 , the voice - activated feature called @entity4 is more than a virtual " assistant " who can help schedule appointments , find a good nearby pizza or tell you if it 's going to rain			1
she 's also a she			0
@entity4 answers questions in a part - human , part - robot voice that 's deep , briskly efficient and distinctly female			1
( at least in the @entity16 and four other countries			0
in @entity14 and the @entity15 , @entity4 is male			0
) people describe the app using female pronouns			2
her gender has even prompted some users to flood blogs and online forums with sexually suggestive questions for @entity4 such as " what are you wearing ? " ( @entity4 's baffled response : " why do people keep asking me this ? " ) the fuss over @entity4 's sex also raises a larger question : from voice - mail systems to gps devices to @entity4 and beyond , why are so many computerized voices female ? one answer may lie in biology			1
scientific studies have shown that people generally find women 's voices more pleasing than men 's			1
" it 's much easier to find a female voice that everyone likes than a male voice that everyone likes , " said @entity44 professor @entity43 , author of " @entity45 to his laptop : what @entity53			1
" " it 's a well - established phenomenon that the human brain is developed to like female voices			1
" research suggests this preference starts as early as the womb , @entity43 said			0
he cites a study in which fetuses were found to react to the sound of their mother 's voice but not to other female voices			1
the fetuses showed no distinct reaction to their father 's voice , however			2
another answer lies in history			0
according to some sources , the use of female voices in navigation devices dates back to @entity77 , when women 's voices were employed in airplane cockpits because they stood out among the male pilots			1
and telephone operators have traditionally been female , making people accustomed to getting assistance from a disembodied woman 's voice			1
when automakers were first installing automated voice prompts in cars ( " your door is ajar " ) decades ago , their consumer research found that people overwhelmingly preferred female voices to male ones , said @entity96 , a @entity97 analyst and president of @entity99 this may explain why in almost all gps navigation systems on the market , the default voice is female			1
one notable exception has been @entity105 , where @entity106 was forced to recall a female - voiced navigation system on its @entity109 cars in the late 1990s after being flooded with calls from @entity105 men saying they refused to take directions from a woman			1
" cultural stereotypes run deep , " said @entity43 , who details the @entity106 episode in his book			2
voice casting most companies that produce automated voices hold auditions for voice actors and collect recordings of them speaking			1
then they invite focus groups to listen to the recordings and rate the voices on how well they convey certain attributes : warmth , friendliness , competence and so on			0
" it 's casting , " @entity43 said			0
" it 's something @entity134 has known for a long , long time			0
" look no further than examples of automated or artificial - intelligence voices in sci - fi movies and tv shows			0
voices of authority or menace tend to be male : the homicidal hal 9000 computer in " 2001 : a @entity144 , " the computer program in " wargames , " or @entity147 , the spaceship 's autopilot function in " @entity150 " more subservient talking machines , such as the onboard computer from the " @entity155 " tv series , skew female			1
@entity96 , the @entity97 analyst , believes that more computerized voices would be masculine if not for the associations with @entity143 , whose malicious intent in the 1968 @entity162 film was made even creepier by his soothing tone			1
" a lot of tech companies stayed away from the male voice because of @entity143 , " he said			1
" i 've heard that theory tossed around multiple times			0
" ( one prominent exception : the chipper " you 've got mail ! " voice from @entity172 's dial - up days			2
) when it comes to consumer applications of computerized voices , the sex of the voice is usually determined by what service or product is employing it			2
for example , transit systems such as the @entity185 's @entity184 often use higher - pitched voices because they are easier to hear over the clatter of the train cars			1
@entity190 , a @entity191 - based company that develops speech technologies for @entity196 vehicles ' @entity194 system , @entity198 e-readers and other clients , creates both male and female voices			1
it 's then up to the client to choose which voice , and gender , best fits their product , said chief creative officer @entity206			2
" as these products become part of our everyday lives , there 's a huge opportunity for personalization , " added @entity207 , the company 's director of advanced speech design			0
" i could have an approximation of my wife 's voice read me a text message in my car			2
" siri : brilliant or sexist ? @entity4 , the @entity223 's voice , grew from a five - year research project that was funded by military agency @entity225 and led by @entity226 , a @entity227 research institute			2
the project spawned a company , also called @entity4 , that launched an @entity3 app in february 2010 and was acquired by @entity231 two months later			0
that original @entity4 voice - to - text app -- powered in part by @entity190 's technology -- also worked by people speaking commands into their phones , although it did n't talk back			1
and it had no gender			0
in fact , the app was originally conceived to speak in a gender - neutral voice , said @entity243 , vice president of @entity226 and a co-founder of @entity4			0
" what @entity231 did is absolutely brilliant , " said @entity243 , who calls speech " the most natural of all human interfaces			0
" " they took @entity4 and gave it more of a personality , " he said			0
" it 's the first real artificial intelligence working in millions of people 's hands			2
" an @entity231 spokeswoman declined to comment on why the company gave @entity4 a female voice in the @entity16 nor would she say why @entity4 speaks like a man in the @entity15 , where @entity223 owners have swarmed online forums to request a female voice instead			1
" eww ! ! @entity263 gets female voice soon , " wrote one commenter			1
" i do n't think anyone in the @entity16 cares about male voice option			1
" many gps devices and computer text - to - speech programs now offer multiple voice options			1
and someday soon , voice - technology experts say , @entity4 will probably speak in a variety of voices , too			2
until then , some bloggers have wondered : are computerized female " assistants " sexist ? not necessarily , said @entity276 , director of the @entity277 at the @entity279 's @entity278			0
" i think they have to be understood in a broader context in which they 're one small piece , " she wrote in an e-mail to @entity0			0
" voices intended to convey authority ( such as voice - over narration in films ) tend to be male			2
so yes , probably these compliant female robot voices reinforce gender stereotypes , not just because they serve the user but because the technology itself is about communication and relationships ( areas that women are presumed to be good at )			2
" i would n't automatically claim any sexism in individual companies ' choices , though			0
most such decisions are probably the result of market research , so they may be reflecting gender stereotypes that already exist in the general public			0
" @entity276 listened to some sound clips of @entity4 online , then e-mailed back again			0
" what 's interesting to me is how they seem to intentionally make her speech sound artificial -- they could choose to make her speech more seamless and human - like , but they choose instead to highlight the technology , " she said			0
" that makes you aware of how high - tech your gadget is			0

studies have shown people generally find women 's voices more pleasing than men 's
*scholar* : " it 's much easier to find a female voice that everyone likes than a male voice "
in @entity105 , some @entity106 *drivers* refused to take gps directions from a woman
tech companies may avoid male computer voices because of @entity143 from the move " 2001 "
