@entity1 journalists also got involved , tweeting pictures of themselves taken at the outsets of their journalism careers and it was so popular that we are already planning to do it again next year ! @entity43 , one of the organizers of @entity1 's open newsroom , explained how a television open day was a pivotal moment in his career			1

many years ago a similar day in @entity56 completely changed my trajectory			0
television news was something that had always sounded exciting to me , but seemed somehow unachievable			0
it was only when i had a chance to try it for myself that i realized it was an option within my reach			0
" the diverse group of people who came to our newsroom yesterday put together something amazing			0
now that they know they can do it i 'm confident we 'll be seeing those enthusiastic faces again			0
