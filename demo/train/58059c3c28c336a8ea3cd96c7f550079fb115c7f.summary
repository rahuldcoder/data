-- despite appearances to the contrary , the @entity1 does n't have a @entity5 problem			1
it is clear from the large demonstrations that have swamped the streets of @entity9 in recent weeks that the @entity5 people want closer integration with the @entity12 , to secure higher prosperity and cleaner government			1
the problem lies with @entity15 and its determination to keep @entity5 within its orbit using threats and inducements			1
in contrast to the @entity12 's adherence to democratic institutions , competitive markets and the rule of law , @entity20 has a rival integration project based on his own model of corrupt state capitalism			2
read more : @entity5 , @entity15 sign economic deal it used to be said that the best way to encourage political and economic reform in @entity15 would be to use the power of example by making a success of reform in @entity5			1
the events of the last few weeks may cast doubt on whether that approach is enough			0
the focus of @entity42 policy - makers should also be on how to re-engage @entity15 , not least because the decline of the country 's energy dominance and the failure to modernize its economy is breaking its growth			1
political repression is adding to these problems by stifling the creative energies of the middle class			0
without meaningful reform , @entity15 faces long - term stagnation and the risk of a major systemic crisis			2
a troubled @entity15 that strives to hold back the countries around it is not in anyone 's interests			2
but what scope do western governments have to influence change for the better ? the " @entity5 first " approach came into vogue because @entity15 leaders simply brushed aside criticism of their record on human rights and business standards			1
if anything , president @entity20 's tone suggests an increasingly belligerent attitude			0
despite this , there are underused levers of persuasion that could form the basis on new transatlantic approach towards @entity15 , especially in the fields of trade and economic relations			2

growth and state revenues require access to foreign export markets			0
large investment shortfalls , especially in the energy sector , demand inflows of foreign capital and technology			0
@entity15 now enjoys the privileges of @entity97 membership and aspires to join the @entity98			0
its elites like to take advantage of international mobility to enjoy life in the @entity1			0
these needs and preferences create points of leverage that the @entity1 could be using to much greater effect			0
by insisting that its status within the global economy is conditional on its maintenance of agreed standards , we can push @entity15 to address deficiencies relating to property rights , investor protection , judicial independence and the rule of law			0
the @entity12 and the @entity119 are already showing that a rules - based approach to business standards can have an impact			1
in targeting @entity15 responsible for human rights violations committed against those seeking to expose unlawful activities carried out by government officials , for example , the 2012 @entity119 @entity124 provides a powerful deterrent to corruption			1
separate provisions of the act press the @entity119 administration to implement a rule of law for the business agenda with @entity15 addressing investor protection			1
@entity139 and @entity119 leaders should keep such lessons in mind as they negotiate the planned @entity142 ( @entity142 )			1
closer economic ties can provide opportunities to influence third party countries			0
one of the @entity142 's aims is to " enhance co-operation " on principles of global concern			0
for @entity15 , this could involve the adoption of a common position on the country 's @entity98 application , investor protection and a crack - down on corruption and economic crimes			2

for example , the so - called @entity124 mandates the @entity119 government to seek compensation of @entity119 investors who had their assets illegally seized with the break up of @entity177			2
@entity139 investors in @entity177 suffered the same fate			0
@entity142 could incorporate principles of collective action and mutual support in such cases			0
initially @entity15 would n't like these measures , but it has far more to lose from a damaged trade and investment relationship than the @entity1 does			1
read more : who broke the law , @entity189 or @entity190 ? @entity139 and @entity191 are bound together in their support for an open global economy			1
it is in their interests to prevent countries like @entity15 from taking advantage of that openness without abiding by the fair market rules that undergird it , or respecting the wishes of independent countries like @entity5 to develop their own economic ties			2
but the country that stands to gain most is @entity15 itself			0
only major economic change will guarantee the growth and prosperity it needs to be strong in the world , and that economic change can only come through partnership with @entity139 and the @entity119 read more : @entity20 pardons oligarch read more : protestors warn of " blood and war " the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity220 .			1

the @entity1 does n't have a @entity5 problem , but rather one with @entity15 , @entity220 argues
@entity220 says the focus of @entity42 policy - makers should be on how to re-engage @entity15
the trade *negotiations* between the @entity119 and @entity12 could be used to increase pressure
@entity191 and @entity139 are bound together , and need to keep @entity15 in the fold
