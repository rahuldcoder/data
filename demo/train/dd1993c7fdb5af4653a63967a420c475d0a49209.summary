-- @entity2 etiquette advice is an old and illustrious profession			1
as long as there 's been a society , there 's also been appropriate social behavior ( and a goodly number of schmucks who do everything wrong )			1
we 've come a long way since the 17th - century , court - appointed rules of courtesy , but things have n't actually changed that much since @entity21 , the maven of manners herself , published " etiquette " in 1922			1
she did n't exactly see our modern array of technology coming ( " with a hair - pin and a visiting card , " she wrote , " ( a woman ) is ready to meet most emergencies			2
" ) , but her do 's and don'ts feel surprisingly modern			2
here are some gems from the delightfully wry brain of an etiquette hero , and our takes on their modern translations			1
then : " a gentleman never discusses his family affairs either in public or with acquaintances , nor does he speak more than casually about his wife			2
a man is a cad who tells anyone , no matter who , what his wife told him in confidence , or describes what she looks like in her bedroom			2
to impart details of her beauty is scarcely better than to publish her blemishes ; to do either is unspeakable			0
" now : @entity21 could have been speaking directly to @entity59 here , moments before he began that really mean blog post tearing apart the chick from " @entity62			1
" the audience to such flagrant meanness was once a bro 's smoking buddies ; now it 's anyone with an internet connection and the ability to @entity70			1
taking to one 's social - media channels to speak ill of a co-worker , friend or lover remains , well , unspeakable			0
vent your frustrations with old - fashioned gossip or scrawl criticism in a diary or in a personal e-mail instead of hitting " publish			0
" then : " the letter you write , whether you realize it or not , is always a mirror which reflects your appearance , taste and character			0
a ' sloppy ' letter with the writing all pouring into one corner of the page , badly worded , badly spelled , and with unmatched paper and envelope -- even possibly a blot -- proclaims the sort of person who would have unkempt hair , unclean linen and broken shoe laces ; just as a neat , precise , evenly written note portrays a person of like characteristics			0
" therefore , while it can not be said with literal accuracy that one may read the future of a person by study of his handwriting , it is true that if a young man wishes to choose a wife in whose daily life he is sure always to find the unfinished task , the untidy mind and the syncopated housekeeping , he may do it quite simply by selecting her from her letters			0
" now : zing ! sexist guilt trips aside , @entity21 's onto something here			1
yes , e-mail and spell check and digital fonts that reveal nothing of your atrocious handwriting have really taken away some of the hand - wringing over correspondence			1
but that means it 's all the more important that you send clean , unblemished e-mails			1
horrific spelling , atrocious grammar , missing punctuation , wingdings galore -- all just as bad as said inkblot			1
then : " when you have been staying over sunday , or for longer , in someone 's house , it is absolutely necessary that you write a letter of thanks to your hostess within a few days after the visit ... do n't be afraid that your ( thank you note to your spouse 's / friend 's parents ) is too informal ; older people are always pleased with any expressions from the young that seem friendly and spontaneous			0
" never think , because you can not easily write a letter , that it is better not to write at all			0
the most awkward note that can be imagined is better than none -- for to write none is the depth of rudeness , whereas the awkward note merely fails to delight			0
" now : thank you notes are hard ! they were hard 90 years ago , too ! and now some of them can come via e-mail so you have no excuse whatsoever for sulking into the ether without a little gratitude - based follow - up			1
it 's the gesture , not the content , that helps , and homegirl 's got a point : a conversational note can make an old person feel more hip , less hip - replacement - seeking			0
then : there are only two forms of farewell : " good - bye " and " good night			0
" never say " @entity187 " unless you have been talking @entity185 , or are speaking to a @entity185 person			0
never interlard your conversation with foreign words or phrases when you can possibly translate them into @entity194 ; and the occasions when our mother tongue will not serve are extremely rare			0
now : in our digital dealings , the problem is less about foreign phrases ( a friendly " @entity201 ! " is better than no thank you at all to the intern who just spent four hours doing data entry for you )			2
rather , the issue is @entity206 -- the ugly @entity208 - bred lexicon that @entity21 could n't have seen coming			1
in nine out of 10 e-mails , posts and other missives , a spelled out word will be clearer and less idiotic - sounding than its abbreviated synonym			2
( this rule does not apply to hilar advice columns of the world , obvi			2

etiquette advice is as old as society , and @entity21 was " maven of manners "
much of her *guidance* can be *updated* to internet age , @entity224 and @entity225 say
e-mails full of poor grammar and spelling have supplanted poor *penmanship* , they say
" thank you " notes are still important , even if they *'re* digital , the two say
