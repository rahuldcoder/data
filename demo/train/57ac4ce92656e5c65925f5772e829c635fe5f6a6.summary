@entity0 , @entity1 -- seven teachers were kidnapped thursday from @entity1 's volatile tribal @entity5 for having supported a polio vaccination campaign , an official told @entity2 saturday			1
" they were not the polio workers , but they had been picked up by the unknown kidnappers for allowing polio vaccination in their school , @entity15 , " said @entity7 , the assistant political agent of @entity8 of @entity5			1
" they were not directly related to polio vaccination , but had supported the workers as volunteers during the recent vaccination drive , and that 's why they had been kidnapped , " he added			1
@entity21 , a local charity that runs the school , and a jirga led by a tribal elder were in talks to resolve the issue , he said			2
the school is in the @entity29 area of @entity30 in the @entity31			0
according to an official who was not authorized to speak to the media and asked not to be identified , a three - day anti-polio campaign had ended friday			2
the @entity39 's assistant director - general for polio , emergencies and country collaboration said saturday that the kidnapped teachers did not appear to have been involved in a polio vaccination campaign , as original reports suggested			1
" we do n't have anything to corroborate that whatsoever , " dr. @entity43 told @entity2 in a telephone interview from @entity45 , citing his contacts in the country who have spoken with people in the area where the abductions occurred			0
" what we have heard is that that 's not the case			0
" at least 16 cases of polio have been reported this year in @entity5 ; law and order problems in @entity30 have left it particularly vulnerable to the disease , which has been declared eradicated from adjacent @entity63			1
anti-polio campaigns have been targeted by militants here since @entity67 intelligence used a fake vaccination program to help in its hunt for @entity70 in 2011			0

since july 2012 , at least 22 polio workers have been killed			0
the polio campaign has a history of controversy in @entity1			2
some mullahs have preached against it , claiming falsely that the oral vaccine leaves @entity1 children sterile			2
last year , a @entity90 commander in northwest @entity1 announced a ban on polio vaccines for children in the region as long as the @entity67 continues its campaign of drone strikes			1
@entity97 , which can cause permanent paralysis in hours , remains endemic only in @entity1 , @entity99 and @entity100			0
after its case count spiked sharply last year , @entity1 stepped up eradication efforts			2
the numbers fell from 198 in 2011 to 58 in 2012 but that progress has stopped : @entity1 is the only one of the three countries where polio is endemic to see its numbers go up this year , @entity39 's @entity43 said			1
as of november 19 , it has seen 63 cases this year versus 54 cases as of that date last year , he said			0
a second concern is spread of the infectious viral disease from @entity1 to other parts of the world -- cases diagnosed this year in @entity100 have been linked directly to virus from @entity1 , he said			1
