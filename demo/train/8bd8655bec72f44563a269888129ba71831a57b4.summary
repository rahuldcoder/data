-- by now it should be painfully obvious that this latest round of the @entity5 - @entity4 crisis in @entity6 is fundamentally different than its predecessors			1
unlike the two previous rounds in 2008 - 09 and in 2012 , which ended after three weeks and one week , respectively , this round , now in its fourth week , is infinitely more complex			0
the rapid failure of the cease - fire put in place by thursday 's agreement only emphasizes that fact			1
getting to de-escalation , let alone a durable endgame , will be hard			0
and here are the five reasons why : 1			0
@entity20 , the political / military paradox : one of the reasons the conflict has dragged on for so long is @entity20 ' anomalous situation			2
it entered the crisis -- indeed may have helped to trigger it -- because it was weak , financially bankrupt and politically isolated , and thought it could get @entity5 and the world 's attention through violence			2
this political weakness has now raised the stakes			0
@entity20 ca n't stand down without major deliverables that will justify to its supporters and residents of @entity6 the death and destruction its rockets have courted			1
and right now as attacks against @entity5 forces attest , the military wing is dominant			2
indeed , militarily it has the power to continue the fight			0
so there 's no real urgency to back off without big gains			0
political desperation , combined with military resilience , ensures the conflict will go on			0
indeed , @entity20 ' goal is probably to launch more rockets against @entity5 the day before the cease - fire is concluded than on the first day the conflict began			1
@entity56 buys space and time : perhaps the most stunning success of this crisis on the @entity5 side has been the @entity56 missile defense system 's capacity to neutralize the threat of @entity20 ' high trajectory weapons			1
with only three civilian casualties , economic damage that is relatively limited and not that dramatic a change in the routine of most @entity5 ( at least those who do n't live close to @entity6 ) the anti-missile defense system has reshaped the basic contours of the conflict			1
on one hand , @entity56 has pre-empted or at least delayed the need for a large - scale ground incursion into @entity6			1
but on the other it has given @entity5 prime minister @entity76 , the political elites and the public the latitude to continue to achieve @entity5 's objectives			0
in short , for @entity5 , too , there 's no real urgency to stand down			2
with the home front secure , the government needs to worry about two things : @entity87 casualties ( so far apparently tolerable at more than 60 even though that 's four times the number in both previous confrontations ) and international pressure as a result of the horrific @entity4 civilian death toll in @entity6			0
and both of these could become magnified in the event @entity5 decides to launch a massive ground incursion into @entity6			1
no good mediator : in 2008 - 09 , @entity5 withdrew its forces and unilaterally declared a cease - fire that held more or less ; in 2012 , the @entity100 brokered one pretty quickly to end that round			1
this time around you have plenty of would - be mediators , including the @entity105 , the @entity106 and @entity100 , all of which were involved in the thursday agreement			0
but that agreement reflects the reality that none of these mediators had much influence with @entity20 ' military wing			0
moreover , all of them misjudged the degree to which @entity20 on the ground in @entity6 was prepared to end the fight			1
there is not a single mediator among them that 's trusted by both sides			0
@entity100 -- no longer run by the @entity125 -- is bent on squeezing the @entity126 and is working closely with @entity5			0
and the @entity105 has no ties or influence with @entity20			0
and we do n't even have a situation where one mediator can work on @entity5 and party @entity132 could mediate with @entity20 in a kind of diplomatic tag team			1
indeed , the flaws of trying to negotiate a cease - fire by committee were all too apparent in the collapse of the thursday accord			1
expectations , the real problem : unlike the two previous confrontations or even the second intifada where @entity5 and @entity20 squared off , this crisis is driven by expectations on each side that will be hard , if not impossible , to meet			1
even if the two sides wanted to stand down , they have raised the hopes among their respective publics that can only constrain each of them and prove disappointing to @entity5 and @entity4 as well			2
@entity76 wants to avoid a massive ground incursion , yet he 's identified an endgame -- demilitarization of @entity20 -- that would require the forceful disarming of an organization that is n't going to agree to give up its weapons voluntarily			0
and the @entity5 public , which has backed the current strategy of trying to pummel @entity20 into submission , expects an outcome that is more decisive than in previous rounds			2
@entity20 , on the other hand , seems -- in a cosmic roll of the dice -- to be holding out at all costs and somehow banking that if it does so , @entity5 will be forced to agree to open up @entity6 ( or will do so willingly ) , release @entity20 prisoners and expand fishing rights and that @entity100 will agree to open up the @entity173 crossing			1
the more death and destruction in @entity6 , the more @entity20 needs an explanation at the end of the day to justify the sacrifices and the pain of @entity6 's 1.8 million residents			2
and it 's not even clear what the objectives of @entity20 ' military wing really are			0
the real tragedy is that the odds against any lasting trade - off of demilitarization for economic freedom seem long indeed without some dramatic change in either @entity5 's or @entity20 ' calculations or @entity20 ' total collapse and defeat			1
not enough urgency : it 's an inconvenient fact , but the reality is that right now , there does n't seem to be enough urgency , let alone an imperative for @entity5 or @entity20 to back down			1
@entity6 's public does n't have much say in the matter when it comes to the @entity20 military wing 's strategy , and the @entity5 public , according to opinion polls , seems enthusiastic about keeping up the pressure			1
@entity5 's calculations seem to be to neutralize the tunnel threat and pummel @entity6 with air and artillery until @entity20 agrees to a cease - fire on @entity5 's terms			1
@entity20 wants to survive with its military and political leadership intact , and it hopes that massive @entity4 casualties will galvanize the international community to press @entity5 to stop and that more @entity87 deaths will cause @entity5 to sour on the operation			2
so where is this headed ? in both previous confrontations , we might have confidently predicted some diplomatic endgame			0
for the moment , the focus has shifted from a brief foray into diplomacy back to escalating conflict			0
the prospects of some kind of an expanded @entity5 operation into @entity6 are highly likely , with all the casualties that could entail			2
what separates this round of the @entity5 - @entity20 battle from the others is that there 's no predictable path away from much more bloodshed			1
and that -- given the tragic loss of life -- is the terrifying truth			0
note : this article was updated to delete references to the capture of an @entity87 soldier ; @entity5 authorities now say the soldier was among those killed by a suicide bomber .			0

cease - fire fails in @entity6 after less than two hours
@entity250 : the latest events demonstrate that this conflict is very different from earlier ones
both sides lack the urgency to make *concessions* needed for a lasting peace , he says
@entity250 : @entity56 has given @entity5 more room to fight ; @entity20 is going all - out for unlikely *victory*
