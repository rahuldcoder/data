-- the @entity1 on friday invoked the government 's " state secrets privilege " to intervene in a private legal dispute between the owner of a @entity7 shipping company and a @entity9 nonprofit that advocates against @entity11 's nuclear program			1
in a court filing in @entity14 , government lawyers asked a judge to dismiss a lawsuit by @entity17 against the group @entity18			1
@entity17 claims he was defamed in a @entity18 campaign that alleged his company had ties to the @entity11 government companies that are involved in @entity11 's nuclear program			2
the government filing said an unnamed @entity9 agency had determined the case risked revealing government secrets			0
@entity17 ' lawyers had sought to compel legal discovery -- the turning over of documents and other information -- from the group , its executives , and from @entity36 investor @entity34 , who @entity38 ' lawyers claim is a funder of @entity18			2
@entity18 lawyers had sought to obtain a deposition of @entity17 to question him about alleged @entity11 ties			0
friday 's government filing provided no detail of how @entity18 , @entity17 , or any others involved could have come to possess @entity9 national security secrets			2
it said that " disclosure of the information at issue reasonably could be expected to cause serious damage to the national security			0
" @entity54 's lawyers have claimed he has no information relevant to the case			0
@entity18 has defended its free speech rights to campaign on the @entity11 issue			0
@entity1 lawyers had previously attended hearings in the case and signaled the possibility the government may intervene , citing possible " law enforcement " secrets			1
the filing friday goes beyond that , and by simply asserting " state secrets , " the government limits what can be reviewed in the case			1
government lawyers also filed a classified court filing that ostensibly provided more information to the judge			1

attorney general @entity86 announced rules that he said would limit the government 's use of the privilege , but leaves his discretion in such cases unaltered			0
government lawyers noted the unusual nature of intervening in a private dispute			1
" while the @entity9 takes this position reluctantly and only after careful consideration , the only appropriate course in light of this privilege assertion is to dismiss this action in its entirety , " the filing said .			0
