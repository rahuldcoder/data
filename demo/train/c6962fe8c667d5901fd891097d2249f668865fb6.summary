-- healthy men and women with good cholesterol levels could significantly reduce their risk of heart disease by taking cholesterol - lowering drugs , better known as statins , according to a study released at the @entity10 meetings in november			1
today , only people with high levels of cholesterol are prescribed cholesterol - lowering drugs , known as statins			2
nearly 18,000 people in 26 countries , including 7,000 women and nearly 5,000 minorities , participated in the clinical trial , the results of which were published in @entity23			0
all had very good cholesterol levels , with average ldl -- or " bad " cholesterol -- levels of 108 and average hdl -- or " good " cholesterol -- levels of 49			1
however , each participant had elevated levels of " high - sensitivity c - reactive protein " or hs - crp -- a marker that indicates inflammation in the body and can contribute to coronary heart disease , the no. 1 killer of men and women in the @entity42			2
under the current guidelines set for lowering cholesterol levels , none of the participants would have qualified for taking statins			1
in the study , the participants took 20 milligrams of the drug rosuvastatin -- commercially known as @entity51 -- or a placebo pill			0
the maker of @entity51 , @entity54 , funded the study			2
according to the lead author , dr. @entity56 of the @entity57 in @entity58 , @entity59 , the pharmaceutical company had no input in the study 's design and did n't see the final data analysis until the study was submitted for publication			1
designed to last up to five years , the trial was stopped after less than two because endpoints set by an independent oversight committee were met , the study says			0
researchers found that participants taking @entity51 cut their risk of heart attack , stroke and death by nearly half -- 44 percent -- compared with participants taking the placebo			1
bad cholesterol levels were reduced by 50 percent and hs - @entity85 levels dropped 37 percent			0
overall death in the @entity51 group was 20 percent less than the placebo group			0
" this is a huge reduction , unprecedented reduction in risk occurring very quickly , " said dr. @entity89 , a cardiologist at @entity91 's @entity90 , who has studied the significance of @entity85 in predicting heart disease			1
@entity89 estimates that 36 million @entity42 qualify for statins and that the new research could add at least 10 million to the ranks of who should be taking cholesterol - lowering drugs			1
some published reports suggest the number could be twice as high			0
the study 's statistician , @entity106 's @entity104 , estimates that about 250,000 heart attacks , strokes , hospitalizations and cardiac deaths could be prevented over five years if people with good cholesterol and high hs - @entity85 levels were taking statins			1
@entity56 , the lead author , said doing so would benefit patients and health care providers , noting a simple blood test to detect hs - @entity85 levels is much cheaper than hospitalization			2
blog : heart disease and cholesterol @entity56 said the diversity of the participants , including women , african - americans and @entity125 , is significant because there is limited information on preventing heart disease among those demographic groups			2
today , only people with high levels of cholesterol are prescribed statins			0
those with good cholesterol levels typically do n't have their hs - @entity85 levels tested because there are no clear guidelines on who should be tested and how often			1
" these studies show that @entity85 levels are now emerging as an important risk factor in the development and progression of coronary heart disease , " said dr. @entity138 , director of the @entity139 , referring to this study and two others being presented at an @entity10 conference this weekend			1
dr. @entity148 , a professor of health policy and cardiology at @entity151 , reviewed the study for @entity23			0
@entity148 agreed the study " provides more evidence about the effectiveness of statin therapy in reducing cardiovascular risk , " even among people who do n't currently meet the guidelines for this kind of therapy			0
but he suggested that before changing any guidelines , more research needs to be done to determine the effectiveness of testing people for hs - @entity85 levels , something this study was not designed to do .			0
