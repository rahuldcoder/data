the wheels are coming off the wagon			0
the fat lady is about to sing			0
the proverbial is about to hit the fan			0
it does n't matter which saying you use , the facts are inescapable			0
@entity10 's membership of the eurozone is untenable under the current conditions and everyone knows it			1
some like @entity16 's finance minister say openly @entity10 will leave the euro			1
the only question is what catalyst will force it out and when			0
the nearest deadline to hand is the country 's june 17th elections , when the @entity10 voters will decide whether to support parties who will adhere to the bailout agreements or those who want to tear them up			1
private economists have gone into overdrive trying to work out what will happen			0
a week ago , @entity34 published " what if @entity10 exits the @entity36 " describing the risk as " rising			1
" @entity38 uses the word " probable " for an exit in certain circumstances while @entity42 published " dealing with a potential @entity10 exit " and says " over the longer horizon the likelihood increases			1
" for the more circumspect euro politicians who have to manage this crisis , there are now well trodden formulae trotted out whenever @entity10 's euro - future is mentioned			1
it goes something like this : 1			0
we want @entity10 to stay in the euro			1
@entity10 must abide by the terms of its agreements with lenders			1
it is up to the @entity10 people how they will vote and if they remain in the euro			1
think of it as the euro - dance ...			0
two steps forward one step back			0
with the debt crisis unfolding : what does it mean to be @entity10 ? some @entity70 officials have become truly expert at performing this dance			1
@entity72 , the @entity73 economics chief , has reiterated it to me			0
and yet , i reason they must be contemplating what happens when the music stops and the euro - dance comes to an end			0
they read the same economics as the rest of us			0
they know that the @entity10 economy is deeply uncompetitive			1
the reforms need not only to continue , but speed up if @entity10 is not to remain on euro - life support forever			1
the only question is whether the @entity10 people are prepared to put up with the pain			2
each day there comes a new twist into the euro - dance			0
there was the rumor that mrs. @entity98 had asked @entity10 to hold a simultaneous referendum with the election on euro - membership			1
the report came from @entity103 : @entity104 denied it			0
clearly one side or the other is playing high stakes hoping to force the issue			0
the argument goes like this : since every poll shows a significant majority of @entity10 people want to stay in the euro , make the june vote a referendum on this issue and voters will come to their senses and be herded back to safely voting for those parties committed to the euro - dance formula			1
while i 've no idea how these next @entity10 elections are going to turn out , my gut feeling is that the other eurozone countries are likely to stay with the stick , and keep any carrots to offer if and when the voters return to their sanity ( as seen from @entity130 )			1
but opinion polls show @entity10 's left - leaning @entity133 party , which does not support the austerity plans , has maintained momentum on the back of the @entity10 people 's discontent			1
if this continues , prepare for @entity10 to crash out of the euro sooner rather than later			2
because if they do not follow the austerity plans , the @entity10 government will not receive more bailout loans to pay its debts			2
and if that happens , it 's not going to be pretty			2
the @entity10 banks will collapse -- they are already on fraying central bank lifelines -- unemployment will soar and i would n't rule out civil unrest			1
who knows what it will look like			0
despite everyone talking about other countries that have defaulted then recovered strongly ( @entity158 , @entity159 ) the reality is nothing this complicated has ever been tried before , certainly not in such a global interconnected world			0
let me say it clearly and loudly			0
the fear is that @entity165 in 2008 will look like a tea party if they get this one wrong			1
what is worrying is that if @entity10 ( only 3 % of @entity73 economy ) goes is who will be next ? @entity16 finance minister @entity171 , who i also spoke to recently , thinks @entity10 wo n't be the only country to exit			1
obviously now everyone has @entity174 in their sights			1
and there is where the real problem lies			1
@entity174 is too big to fully bail out a la @entity10 and definitely too big too fail			1
if @entity174 gets into too much trouble " @entity36 " is likely over			2
from all my private talks with @entity70 officials it has become clear -- @entity174 is the line in the sand			2
@entity10 may be too far gone and be allowed to fall , but @entity174 will be defended till the bitter end			1
so i fully expect @entity70 leaders to give @entity174 something to take the boot off the throat of austerity in the coming weeks			2
probably the same for @entity192			0
@entity70 officials have made mistakes in their dealings with @entity10			2
the austerity measures were too harsh			0
they should n't have been nearly so brutal , and that lesson has been learned			0
now with the election of @entity200 as @entity202 's new president everyone can change course slightly and pretend they meant to do it all along ( they did n't )			2
expect a growth pact to be agreed between @entity208 and @entity202 to sit alongside the main @entity209 , which @entity208 will not allow to be re-opened			0
i could speculate for hours about which solution will be found , what formula they will adopt to keep the whole thing moving -- and frankly , it would be useless			0
this crisis is now moving too fast and has taken on a life of its own			0
the firewall is starting to smolder			0
the austerity plans are starting to fray			0
the @entity221 is cutting loose several @entity10 banks it does not consider solvent			2
the eurozone is all but back in recession			2
there are some uncontrollable aspects ( the @entity10 voters for instance ) which make forecasting the future direction just about impossible			1
i still believe that the single currency will survive in some shape and form			1
i just can not see the eurozone surviving in its present form -- not without the most drastic reorganization towards fiscal union , a federation of states with a central bank and treasury			1
please , eurozone , do n't tell me that is not the @entity70 way			2
i am telling you ...			0
it 's the only way			2
your way has failed and @entity70 's 300 million people are now relegated to slow , second class growth as a result for the foreseeable future .			2

@entity252 's @entity251 believes @entity10 's membership of the eurozone is untenable under the current conditions
but an exit from the common currency could make @entity165 's collapse look like a tea party if it is badly handled
and @entity174 is in the *markets* ' sights , which is a real problem
quest believes the currency will survive , but not in the present form
