-- he 's the greatest player in the modern tennis era , perhaps even of all time , but is @entity5 's stellar career fading to twilight ? the 17 - time grand slam champion is " in a very vulnerable state " ahead of his opening match at the @entity9 on monday , according to top coach @entity10			1
@entity5 regained the world no. 1 ranking with last year 's record - equaling seventh @entity14 title , but since then he has struggled with both his game and his fitness , and is seeded just seventh for the season 's closing grand slam in @entity19			1
" @entity5 is great for the game			1
he 's fantastic on court and fantastic off court			2
he 's well respected , and he respects all the opponents that he plays , " @entity10 told @entity0			1
" @entity5 is in a very vulnerable state			1
he 's in a vulnerable position because he 's moved down to no. 7 now			2
remember @entity27 went through a tough period			0
fortunately for @entity27 he won a big one before he left the tour			2
" my @entity30 went from no. 1 to no. 142 in the world , and he left on a pretty good note			0
what we do n't want to remember is @entity5 leaving on a low note			1
" he 's been fantastic , he moves beautifully , he does everything with ease			0
this is a big tournament for @entity5			1
" being seeded so low , the 32 - year - old faces a possible quarterfinal clash with his old rival @entity42 , who recovered from serious knee problems to retain his @entity45 title in june and has now bounced back from his shock first - round loss at @entity14 with masters victories in @entity49 and @entity50			1
" he is playing unbelievable , he has brought a new dimension to his game , " @entity10 said of @entity53 's world @entity51			1
" he can move back eight to 10 feet or he comes forward and hits the ball very early			0
" he 's improved his serve and he 's a lefty -- he 's very dangerous			0
he 's full of confidence , so watch out ! " the power of players such as @entity42 is making it so much harder for the classically elegant @entity5 , says @entity10			1
the @entity60 has this year experimented with using a bigger racquet such as his rivals employ , but has switched back again			0
" when you get a @entity42 hitting those heavy crosscourt lefties , and then serving out wide , it is difficult , " said the 82 - year - old , who has coached 10 world no. 1 players across the men 's and women 's game			1
" however , i believe that the @entity9 and the @entity71 ( in january ) is going to tell the story			1
" @entity5 is coached by @entity73 , a former student of @entity10 who also worked with @entity27 for several years			1
" i believe right now @entity5 can not win just standing on the baseline			2
i believe he has to come in , " @entity10 said			2
@entity10 is concerned that an underwhelming end to his career could undo the @entity5 legacy			1
" it would be a shame if people forgot who he was , " he said			0
" look at what he brought to the game			0
he lived a beautiful private life			0
he 's always respectful of the sport			0
he 's respectful of his opponents			0
you do n't find too many people who represent life , whether it be business or sports , like this guy			0
" [ @entity5 ] has been an ambassador on the court , and an ambassador off the court			2
how can you be much better than @entity5 ? he 's just a credit to the tour			1
he 's a credit to his foundation			0
so it 'll be awful tough to replace @entity5			2
" " the sport is very lucky to have had a @entity5			2
" while @entity5 's future may seem uncertain , @entity10 said that of @entity105 is entirely in her own hands			1
the world @entity107 can match @entity5 's grand slam haul if she retains her @entity9 title at @entity111			1
she also begins her campaign monday , along with older sister @entity113			0
turning 32 on september 26 , @entity105 will be the oldest female winner of the hard - court tournament if she does triumph			2
the @entity116 won the @entity45 for the second time in june , but surprisingly lost in the last 16 at @entity14			0
although she bounced back from that with titles in @entity122 and @entity123 , a defeat in the @entity50 final to second - ranked @entity126 -- just her fourth in 64 matches this year -- again showed that she is not invincible			1
" when @entity105 wants to play the game and she 's happy within herself , to me she 's the best player in the history of the game of tennis , " said @entity10 , who has worked with both the @entity105 sisters			1
" when @entity105 's taking the ball early , she 's dangerous			0
when she moves back behind the baseline , she 's vulnerable			0
" it 's all up to @entity105			0
she 's won a lot of money , she 's done great things for the sport , but it 's what she has inside her -- does she still want to compete ? " @entity105 ' bid for a fifth @entity19 crown has been made slightly easier by the withdrawal of @entity145 due to shoulder problems , though she has dominated the @entity147 in big matches			1
@entity10 said @entity145 , who came to his famed @entity150 academy as a young girl , will always have weaknesses in her game since the shoulder surgery in 2008 that almost ended her career			2
" when you have a shoulder operation , that affects the forehand and it affects the serve , " he said			0
" when you have a shoulder injury and you can not serve big - time , you 're in trouble because the returns today on the tour are dangerous			0
" the girls are standing on the baseline -- if you have a tentative serve they 're going to put you to sleep or put you on the defense			0

@entity5 plays @entity170 's @entity169 in his opening match monday
he won @entity9 five times in a row from 2004 , but is now ranked seventh
@entity10 says his performances in @entity19 and @entity177 will *dictate* his future
the 32 - year - old faces a potential quarterfinal against in - form rival @entity42
