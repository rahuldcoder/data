a public fight this week between the @entity1 and the @entity3 head of the @entity4 is the latest act in a years - long drama over waterboarding			1
it involves substantive issues such as @entity1 spying on @entity11 and the power of the legislative branch to oversee the executive branch			1
at the core , the matter focuses on how much history to reveal about the way @entity19 detained and interrogated terror suspects in response to the 9/11 @entity23 attacks			0
here are answers to some of the basic questions about the dispute : 1 ) what is all the yelling about ? more than five years after president @entity30 ended the controversial interrogation program started during the @entity33 administration , security chiefs and politicians are still battling over how much official information should be made public			1
a 6,300 - page report on the program by the @entity4 remains classified amid discussions between @entity11 and the spy agency on what to reveal			2
when researching the report , committee staffers got hold of a separate , internal @entity1 review of the information made available to @entity4 investigators			1
alarmed by outside access to the secret document , the @entity1 then searched computers used by committee staffers and then sought a @entity53 investigation			2
on tuesday , @entity4 chairman @entity54 of @entity55 publicly accused the @entity1 of effectively spying on the committee and raised the possibility that the agency impeded the probe and perhaps broke laws in the process			1
@entity1 director @entity62 responded with a flat - out denial of any wrongdoing			1
2 ) what 's really going on ? this is @entity67 , so there must be a political angle , though other considerations also come into play			0
for example , participants in the detention / interrogation program could face lawsuits at home and abroad over their role in torture such as waterboarding			1
some cases are pending and rights groups continue to press for more information for possible further challenges by current and former detainees			0
in comments tuesday to the @entity86 , @entity62 cited the importance of getting the report right , saying @entity19 " owe it to the women and men who faithfully did their duty in executing this program to try to make sure that any historical record of it is a balanced and accurate one			1
" " i will protect sources and methods , you know , in terms of the tremendous investment that this country has made in some of , you know , the very sensitive collection systems that help to keep this country safe , " he said			0
the purely political explanation has @entity3 seeking full exposure of the @entity109 roots of the detention and interrogation program described by @entity54 as " un-american " and " brutal			1
" she described how the committee 's investigation that started in full force in 2009 followed revelations that " the interrogations and the conditions of confinement at the @entity1 detentions sites were far different and far more harsh than the way the @entity1 had described them to us			2
" 3 ) who spied on who ? spies spy , especially when they think they 're being spied on			0
@entity62 informed @entity54 in january the @entity1 had looked at the computers used by @entity4 staff to figure out how they got hold of the internal review ordered by former cia director @entity133			1
" the @entity1 's search may well have violated the separation of powers principle embodied in the @entity137 , including the speech and debate clause , " @entity54 said tuesday			2
" it may have undermined the constitutional framework essential to effective congressional oversight of intelligence activities or any other government function			0
" however , the @entity1 has asked the @entity53 to look into whether committee staffers did anything wrong in accessing the so - called @entity133 review , which was supposed to be an internal deliberative document and therefore unavailable			2
@entity54 insisted her committee workers simply used the access provided them by the @entity1 , and she called the agency 's tactics and response an attempt at intimidation			1
" i have asked for an apology and a recognition that this @entity1 search of computers used by its oversight committee was inappropriate , " she said			0
" i have received neither			0
" 4 ) what happens now ? more accusations , counter-claims and political wrangling as both sides seek some kind of agreement on what parts of the committee 's report can be made public			1
while legal ramifications including criminal charges are possible , the back - and - forth so far appears to be more about pressure tactics and brinksmanship			0
@entity109 have kept mostly silent about the dispute , though rep. @entity175 of @entity176 , who chairs the @entity177 , told @entity178 that any wrongdoing should be punished if proven			0
@entity62 said he 's awaiting a request from @entity11 to declassify portions of the committee report			2
asked about the issue on wednesday , @entity30 told reporters that he 's " committed to declassifying " the information once the report is completed			0
however , @entity30 said he would not weigh in on the explosive accusation that the @entity1 overreached and spied on the @entity4			0
@entity177 intel chair warns of penalty if @entity1 searched @entity4 computers			0

sen. @entity54 accuses the @entity1 of spying on her intelligence committee staff
@entity1 director @entity62 denies any wrongdoing
at issue is an *upcoming* report on the now - ended detention and interrogation program
the question now involves how much of the report will be made public
