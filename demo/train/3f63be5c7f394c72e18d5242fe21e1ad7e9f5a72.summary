-- when i " beat " cancer the first time , i was excited			1
my daughter was on her way to remission as well , and we were going to be a normal family again			1
then @entity10 's cancer came back with a vengeance , and she was taken from us			1
i wanted to trade places with her , but i was better			1
i was in remission , and i had to learn to live again , even though my baby girl had died			1
so i did just that			2
i started a nonprofit neuroblastoma foundation in @entity10 's honor , helped my husband start a business called @entity20 to distribute products i had made for her when she was sick , and gave birth to our second child			1
@entity26 sews a new dream after toddler 's death life seemed to be moving in the right direction			1
i felt great , and while there was always a little voice telling me remission was n't a guarantee , i thought that i had made all the necessary changes in my lifestyle to keep me cancer - free forever			1
then , in one instant of excruciating pain , that belief that everything was going to be ok was gone			2
a kidney stone sent me to the er. when the doctor came back with the ct results , i was n't expecting the words that would come out of her mouth : " you have a 4 - millimeter kidney stone			2
but you also have some swollen lymph nodes next to your aorta			2
they were flagged by the radiologist because of your history			2
" the world went silent , which is a feat , considering i was sitting in a busy @entity43 i 'm pretty sure i stared dumbfounded at the doctor for at least a minute , unmoving			2
those words stuck in my head			2
while i did my best to believe that follow - up tests would be negative , in the back of my mind , i knew			2
i was sent home to pass my kidney stone , and to start the excruciating process of figuring out what the heck was going on inside my body			2
@entity72 came the scans -- @entity74 and @entity75			2
waiting for test results takes an extreme emotional toll			0
with every day that passed i grew more anxious , and more unfocused			0
the news came at lunchtime on a tuesday six weeks after that fateful @entity43 trip			0
" they are calling it a @entity87 's lymphoma , " the doctor said			1
all i could say was , " ok			0
then frustration set in , quickly followed by extreme annoyance			0
how could this be happening again ? i did n't have time to deal with cancer			1
i had a foundation to run , a business to help with , and first and foremost , an 8 - month - old to take care of			0
when i set out to fix something , i do it right			0
i think this is why my cancer relapse hit me so hard			1
it means i have to go back to the drawing board and start again			0
it 's a feeling of failure that is hard to overcome			1
i have tried not to let my family and friends see my disappointment , but it has been almost impossible to hide			0
this time , cancer is n't the unknown beast it was the first time i was diagnosed			1
this time cancer was the nagging neighbor who finally moved and put their house on the market and then decided to come back instead of paying closing costs			1
relapse is a fear of the known			1
i know what chemo feels like			0
i know the nausea , the hair loss , the numbness , the fatigue , the burning veins and the pain			0
i know that chemo can take me from feeling great to feeling like crap in less than four hours			0
i know what high - dose chemo does to a patient whose only wish is to live a little bit longer			0
i 've seen quality of life stripped away for a chance at a few more months , and the ever - diminishing chance of a cure			0
with that knowledge came a major decision : should i give in and allow myself to be thrown back into the chaos of toxic therapy -- or defy the fear and find a better way ? during the six weeks i waited for my test results , i started to think about , talk about , and research different treatment options			1
i was n't comfortable doing chemotherapy again , as i knew the treatment would be much more intense and toxic than what i had already been through			0
when relapse was confirmed , my general practitioner told me about homeopathic cancer therapy			1
i did more research , and made more phone calls			0
my doctors are on board , especially since i have a slow - growing disease			0
while some may not understand my choice to forgo conventional treatment , this time around i 'm determined not to be scared into toxic therapy			0
this is a chance to take back control of my body			0
i 'm determined to beat cancer , and i know that i am strong enough to do so			1
after all , i did it once before			0
