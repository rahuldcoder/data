it 's finally legal to swim off the shore of @entity3 , @entity4 , after a crowd of sharks dispersed into deeper waters tuesday , officials say			1
the trouble on @entity3 began friday when a helicopter pilot took a picture of five sharks circling a boat near @entity13			1
the pilot relayed the picture to the city administrator , who told lifeguards to get swimmers out of the water			1
what on @entity20 eats a 9 - foot great white ? on saturday afternoon , double red flags -- warnings to would - be swimmers to stay out of the @entity25 -- were raised over the half - mile stretch of beach where the number of sharks continued to grow			1
" there have been a significant amount of shark sightings prompting us to close the water in these areas			2
it is unlawful to enter the water when double red flags are flying , " read a saturday post on the @entity41 's facebook page			0
from that point , the situation only got worse			0
@entity3 safety director @entity44 , who says swarms like this are extremely rare , told @entity47 he saw a photo of 18 sharks in the same stretch of water sunday			1
" i 've lived on the coast here my whole life , and i 've never seen a group of sharks as large as this one , " said @entity44			0
so what 's drawing the sharks ? @entity44 has a hunch			0
@entity60 is known for its fresh seafood , and fishing boats are a common sight on the horizon			0
it 's customary for fishermen returning to port to clean their catch and dump the waste material -- heads , tails , guts , bones -- into the water , leaving it to the mercy of the tides			1
" when the water gets pulled out into the @entity25 , the carcasses go with it			0
... if ( sharks ) see a free meal , they 're going to come get it , " @entity44 said			0
drawn ever closer to the source of their free lunches , the sharks could have entered waters close to shore , setting off the dangerous state of affairs in @entity3			1
the sharks began to move away from the beach monday			2
according to the fire department 's @entity95 page , aerial reports from that evening showed substantial dissipation in the sharks ' ranks			2
it was not until early tuesday afternoon that @entity3 was given the all - clear			2
the ban on entering the water was lifted after officials aerially observed only a few sharks off the jetties at @entity13			1
rare goblin shark was n't the only thing that surfaced human remains found in search for woman ' taken ' by large shark in @entity113			0
