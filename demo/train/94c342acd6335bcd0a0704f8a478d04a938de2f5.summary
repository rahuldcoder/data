anyone who rents a car in @entity2 is immediately handed a map of the country on which most of the landscape is marked out of bounds			1
any attempt to leave the main highway results in splutters of indignation from in - car gps units			2
this area , the computer complains , is n't suitable for such a tiny rental vehicle			0
it 's a tough call , because the places they do n't want us to go in our little cars are some of the most alluring on @entity21			0
these are the mighty , brooding volcanoes that dominate @entity2 's skyline			1
some slumbering , some angrily spewing out rivers of lava and cloudy torrents of ash			0
they 're not impossible to reach though			0
not if you call in the experts			0
for me , this means meeting @entity35 , an @entity2 guide who possesses an engaging grasp of deadpan humor , and an understated passion for his country 's geological wonders			1
crucially , he also owns several enormous 4x4 trucks with tires big enough to crush my whining gps and the car it came in			2
our goal for the day is @entity51 , the volcano with the unpronounceable name that in 2010 sent plumes of dangerous silica dust into the atmosphere , disrupting @entity58 air travel and stranding millions of passengers			1
the main show is a couple of hours out of @entity62 , but there are plenty of warmup acts along the way			0
we check out @entity67 , a petrified red lava field beyond the city limits where early @entity2 highway builders harvested construction materials in the days when less care was taken over preserving the country 's topography			1
icy stalagmites we ascend through clouds of stinking sulfur near a geothermal power plant at @entity78 , past acres of volcanically heated greenhouses at @entity80 and pause briefly for a photo op at @entity82 , a semi-frozen waterfall surrounded by icy stalagmites			0
" can you see how some of the sheep take bigger risks grazing right on the edge ? " asks @entity35 , pointing to some woolly creatures munching on the precipice leading to the waterfall			0
i 'm expecting some insight into @entity2 fauna at this point , but that 's not really how @entity35 rolls			1
" stupid animals , " he adds			0
" the grass tastes the same wherever they eat			0
" in the shadow of @entity51 we pause by @entity103 , a 60 - meter spout of meltwater from the volcano 's snow - capped summit			1
a treacherously icy trail leads behind the roaring curtain of water			0
@entity35 also takes me to the @entity111 , another giant water plume hidden nearby in cavernous mossy grotto			2
then we 're off the main road and ascending the side of the volcano , powering up above the snowline along a cinder track			2
suddenly we veer off into a brilliant wasteland of drifting white powder			0
here the enormous studded tires that have been thudding the 4x4 along the road from @entity62 come into their own , sloshing through iced - over streams and clawing their way up steep banks of snow			1
when the wheels begin to spin , we stop to let air out of the tires for better traction			0
" in the summer , you would n't believe how many tourists we find stuck out here , " says @entity35 , shaking his head			0
" they think they can drive here in their little cars			0
" geothermal bathing prejudices against small vehicles aside , @entity35 's hit on an issue facing @entity2 as it encourages more visitors to revive an economy battered by a 2008 banking collapse			1
the country is gambling on being able to attract millions of visitors in coming years , but there are questions over whether the infrastructure of its wild and sometimes dangerous attractions is capable of handling them			1
and while roaring up the side of a snow - covered volcano in a bright orange 4x4 might not seem the most ecological of options , in the hands of skilled guide it 's a environmentally friendlier option than unsupervised mass roaming			1
it 's crazy fun too , especially when @entity35 lets me have a go at the wheel			0
there ca n't be many things more thrilling than driving a monster truck across the side of a snow - covered volcano -- gunning the engine to crest icy ridges and swerving around huge boulders scattered by old eruptions -- and if there are , they 've probably been illegal since the late ' 70s			1
we reach the limit for the 4x4 , with the volcano 's conical summit rising in front of us			1
the rest of the journey , up and over the rim into the now - dormant caldera , requires the use of @entity35 's snowmobiles			2
although @entity51 is our destination today , itineraries can include other volcanoes reached by thrilling rides across seemingly impassible landscapes			1
there 's @entity199 , to the north , overlooking a sea of beautiful black sand and a geothermal bathing pool			0
" @entity199 has a woman 's name , " says @entity35			0
" and she looks beautiful , but she has a temper , erupting every 10 or 15 years			2
" others include @entity208 , named after a witch and reputedly haunted , and @entity210 , @entity2 's most active volcano , where a geothermally heated glacial lake sits in a 35 - kilometer wide crater			1
since august , @entity215 has been throwing up a spectacular display of boiling magma , giving the aviation industry palpitations but at the same time making it @entity2 's hottest attraction			1
@entity221 's birthday treat due to the risk from toxic gases ( and hostile gps computers ) , ground access to @entity215 is limited			1
the eruption at the volcano 's @entity228 lava field can be seen from chartered planes or helicopters -- @entity221 and @entity232 reportedly made a flyby ealier this month to celebrate the rapper 's 45th birthday			2
it 's such a dramatic sight that an @entity238 pilot earlier this year diverted a flight to give passengers a better look			0
turning back to begin our descent of @entity51 , @entity35 and i take in the incredible crystal - clear view of @entity247 , an archipelago of islands formed off @entity2 's southern coast by a series of volcanic eruptions			1
the youngest island , @entity254 , is only 50 years old and is classed as one of @entity2 's several dozen volcanoes			1
even on huge tires , it 's a bone - jolting ride down to sea level -- but that 's ok since i 'll be spending the night at @entity262 ( @entity263 10 , @entity62 ; +354 580 0101 ) , which has considerably more relaxing geothermal attractions ( steam room and whirlpool ) in the basement			1
before we head back to the capital , we call in at a farm nestled against the base of @entity51			1
here i meet @entity271 , a retired teacher whose family has built a roadside visitor center to cope with the influx of tourists eager to see the volcano that in 2010 temporarily engulfed their farm in blizzards of ash and brought a large of the planet to a standstill			2
she tells me why she thinks @entity51 exerts such a pull			2
" there were 10 million affected when it erupted , " she says			0
" because of this volcano , many people 's lives changed -- they had an extra week of vacation , or they had to rent a car and drive for miles , or they did n't get to a loved one 's funeral			2
" now they want to see the thing that made that happen			0
" the popularity nearly became a problem , she says , hence the need to convert a disused machine shop into a visitor center to keep tourists from driving through her farm and into the valley beyond			0
" my husband was always busy , pulling people out when they got stuck in their small cars ! " back in our gigantic 4x4 , @entity35 fires up the engine and we hit the road			0
@entity311 ( +354 544 5454 ) organizes super-jeep tours to volcanoes and other geological attractions across the country			2
plane and helicopter flights over @entity215 can be arranged from @entity62 domestic airport via @entity319 ( @entity320 12 , @entity62 ; +354 588 1300 ) .			1

volcano *safari* tours in @entity2 involve driving up @entity51 in a giant - wheeled 4x4 super jeep
in 2010 eruptions from @entity51 grounded thousands of *transatlantic* flights and stranded millions
other volcanic attractions include @entity215 , which has been erupting since august 2014
