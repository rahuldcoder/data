you could blame weeds , trees , and grasses if you start itching , sneezing , coughing , and wheezing this fall			1
but the usual suspects are n't the only triggers			2
a host of household items -- candles , chemicals , stuffed animals , and spices -- may be the real culprits			1
from blue jeans buttons to limes to teddybears , allergy triggers come in many ways , shapes and forms			1
" many homes are filled with irritants , and if there 's a high enough count of an irritant , you 'll react , " says @entity20 , @entity21 , an allergy expert and professor of pediatric immunology at @entity24			1
here , a rundown of 11 sneaky suspects -- and how to stop them from bothering you			2
candles you ca n't be allergic to essential oils -- which make candles smell like autumn leaves or dune grass -- but their odors can inflame your nasal cavities , according to @entity43 , @entity21 , chief of allergy and immunology at the @entity46			1
" people with nasal allergies have a natural increased sensitivity , so they 're likely to get a runny nose or watery eyes around candles , " he says			1
" to the person with the sensitive nose , it 's no different than cigarette smoke			2
" what to do : if you 're very sensitive , avoid candles altogether			1
but if you love the smell and want to use them at home , buy candles that have few ingredients and feature just one scent , such as pumpkin			1
by a process of elimination you may be able to pinpoint which scent or ingredient bothers you			2
( smoke from candles can also be an irritant , though that usually comes from snuffing it out ; open a window or blow out the flame outside			1
) if you have a bad reaction to a scented candle , getting some fresh air should make you feel better			1
perfume fragrances can contain hundreds of chemicals that are mostly untested on humans , @entity43 says			2
when those chemicals bond with the essential oils in perfumes and are then sprayed into the air , sensitive people may take offense			2
@entity89 , congestion , and headaches can be the result			2
what to do : kindly ask your colleagues to go easy on their favorite fragrances , and bring a portable fan to keep your area as scent - free as possible			2
if the thought of not wearing a fragrance leaves you blue , stick with body creams and moisturizers that have light scents			2
these are less likely to irritate you			2
soaps and detergents you think it 's the chemicals in cleaning products that make you itch ? surprise : " the majority of skin sensitivities are caused not by the cleaning agent but by a perfume additive , " @entity43 says			2
" and nearly every soap now has some sort of plant in it to make it fancy -- roses , elderberries , etc. the skin can respond with irritation , and give you a rash			2
" read more on how to identify a rash what to do : buy organic or specially marked soaps ; look for " no additives , " " nonscented , " or " phthalate - free " on the label			0
phthalates are chemicals that help improve texture , but they 've been linked to allergic reactions ; products that contain them may have " diethylphthalate " or something similar on the label			1
@entity137 , @entity138 , and @entity139 all offer low - irritant products , as do many organic brands			0
if fabric softener seems to be giving your skin fits , try using a sheet of aluminum foil in your dryer instead ; this trick will get rid of static cling			0
or use a scent - free , no - additive version , like @entity151			0
if you 're in a public laundromat , wash and dry towels first , which will soak up the residue left behind by previous users			0
then be sure to use that same washer and dryer to clean and dry your clothes			0
stuffed animals dust mites living in mattresses and pillows are a huge allergy trigger			1
roughly 15 percent of the population is allergic to these microscopic bugs			1
@entity168 mattresses and pillows with impen ­ etrable covers and cases is a useful step , but it 's not enough			0
the mites also love kids ' favorite furry toys			1
what to do : @entity178 , dry , then repeat ... and use very hot water			0
" toys should be washed at 140 degrees , which will ensure that the mites are killed , " @entity20 says			1
after they 're clean store them on a shelf , not on the bed			0
what to do with the nonwashable toys ? every two to three weeks put them in a plastic bag in the freezer for a couple of hours , which will also kill the mites			1
carpeting you may love the feel of carpeting under your feet , but mites find it just as attractive			1
" even if you vacuum constantly , you 've still got mites , " @entity43 warns			1
what to do : remove wall - to - wall carpeting -- who does n't like a beautiful wood floor ? -- and use small rugs that can be washed in hot water monthly			1
" and keep the humidity below 50 percent " with your central air system or a dehumidifier , @entity20 says			1
" dust mites thrive in humidity			1
" read more on how to allergy - proof your house spices they add nuance and zing to a variety of dishes , but there 's no getting around spices ' origin : pungent plants			1
for some people , eating the spices made from these plants leads to a just little sniffling			1
for others , it may cause itching , swelling , and even burning of the lips			0
what to do : avoid the spices more likely to cause trouble : coriander , poppy seeds , pepper , dill , paprika , cumin , and saffron -- which , in broad strokes , means @entity240 and @entity241 food			0
if you 're not sure which spices bother you , record what you 've been exposed to each time you have symptoms and look for the common denominator			1
need help planning an allergen - free @entity248 ? read on for some tips @entity252 trees a word to the wise before the holidays : @entity255 grows fast on @entity252 trees			1
" when you put that tree in a bucket of water , invisible mold grows almost immediately , " @entity43 says			1
" most people are allergic to or irritated by mold spores			1
" what to do : try a fake tree			0
ca n't live without a real one ? ask when it was cut down before you buy it ; trees that were cut weeks in advance are already ripe with mold			1
then , starve it of water and keep it for as short a period as possible			0
@entity255 grows on houseplants , too , so keep them on the dry side			0
@entity279 paint the solvents and synthetic resins used in paint often lead to itchy eyes and headaches			1
oil - based paints are a particular problem because they can continue releasing chemicals even after they dry			0
what to do : keep windows open as often as possible and allow fresh air to circulate for four weeks after painting , no matter what kind of paint you use			2
" once it has dried -- and i mean really dried , weeks later -- the odor goes away , and you wo n't have a problem , " @entity43 says			0
if possible , use latex paint , which emits less gas than oil - based kinds due to its water base			2
by the way , there is n't any real latex in latex paint , so if you 're allergic to latex gloves the same wo n't apply to the paint			1
what about paint with low levels of @entity313 ( volatile organic compounds ) ? they spew fewer chemicals into the air and are less smelly than regular paints			2
but that does n't mean they wo n't bother you			0
to find these paints , look for the " @entity323 " certification mark on the label			0
alcohol an actual allergy to alcohol is quite rare , but being allergic to the grains and additives used in liquor is not : wheat or the preservative sulfur dioxide could cause a rash or a stuffy nose			1
@entity335 allergist @entity334 , @entity21 , founder of the information site @entity337 , also blames grains like corn , bar ­ ley , and rye , as well as fruit flavorings			0
wine and beer may create problems , too			0
what to do : stick with grain - free liquors like potato vodka , rum ( made from sugar ) , and tequila ( the agave plant )			0
and if sulfite preservatives in wine bother you , red wine tends to have fewer preservatives than white			0
also , look for wine labeled " sulfite - free " ( it wo n't stay fresh for long )			0
and remember that anything with carbonation ( like a wine cooler ) increases the likelihood of an allergic reaction , @entity334 adds			1
blue jeans buttons the buttons on your jeans are probably made with the metal nickel -- a rash trigger for up to 20 percent of women			2
a nickel rash near your waistline is usually itchy , red , and sometimes blistery			0
what to do : take your pants to a tailor and have her replace the nickel buttons with plastic ones ( another metal might also cause irritation )			0
a second option : coat the button with clear nail polish , a remedy found to be effective in a recent @entity389 study			0
just be aware that nail polish itself may lead to a rash if you 're sensitive to it			0
lemons and limes @entity397 , a zesty compound in lime and other citrus fruits , gives many people watery eyes and a burning sensation in the nose , @entity43 says			0
it might even irritate your skin , whether you touch it or eat or drink products containing limonene			0
what to do : if you get a rash , treat it with topical hydrocortisone creams used for bug bites and poison ivy			0
skip the lemon or lime wedge with your drink or salad , and look out for lime in salad dressings , desserts , and marinades ( it 's used in numerous dishes )			0
