-- comedian @entity1 delivered on his reputation for controversy as host of " @entity5 " this weekend , but musical guest @entity6 is the one soaking up accolades for making history			1
in a rare tv appearance , the artist performed one long , uninterrupted jam session instead of two songs , a first in the sketch show 's 40 - year run			0
the medley showcased songs from @entity6 's studio albums with band 3rdeyegirl and featured guest vocalist @entity19 in what @entity20 called " one of the most explosive and most polished ' snl ' musical spots " in recent memory			0
the performance drew overwhelmingly positive praise , contrasting the mixed reviews @entity1 received for his second turn as host			2
the " @entity5 " alum wasted no time reminiscing over what it was like to be part of the cast in the early 1990s , or how it felt to return his old stomping grounds after last hosting 18 years ago			1
instead , @entity1 dove right into the @entity42 , the september 11 attacks , the commercialization of @entity38 and gun control in his opening monologue			2
he poked fun at the @entity44 ( " the ' @entity45 " ) as a terrorism target , and said it was only a matter of time before september 11 becomes an excuse to offer $ 9.11 shrimp specials at @entity50			1
to some it was humorous , maybe even tame for the comedian who took on the @entity53 days after the massacre			0
for others , the monologue did n't sit so well , especially the night before the @entity57			0
other memorable moments , for better or worse , included a mock diversity training video , " @entity60 , " featuring @entity1 as a " diverse person , " and a sketch in which @entity64 militants compete on on the @entity66 reality tv show , " @entity67			1
