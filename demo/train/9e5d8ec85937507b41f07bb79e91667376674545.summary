remember @entity1 's chemical weapons ? yes , those , the ones the @entity1 regime agreed to give up after president @entity3 threatened to bomb			1
all of the " priority one " the most dangerous of those weapons , were supposed to be gone by december 31 last year			1
almost all of them -- more than 95 % -- are still in @entity1 despite a commitment by the @entity1 president @entity11 to get rid of his deadly arsenal			1
the deal to remove @entity1 's stock of @entity15 was the one tangible accomplishment of the @entity3 administration 's approach to the @entity20 's multiple crises			1
now that deal looks to be failing , even as red flags also start flying along the path to a deal with @entity24			1
it 's hard to escape the impression that @entity24 and its close ally , @entity1 , are toying with the @entity28 @entity28 is earnestly seeking a diplomatic solution			1
and we should all hope diplomacy succeeds in securing an agreement that stops the carnage in @entity1 and one that prevents @entity24 from becoming a greater threat to its neighbors			1
but there is a reason these efforts are already running into trouble			0
secretary of state @entity40 is valiantly pursuing the suit - and - tie approach to peace , but @entity40 is handicapped by the growing perception that @entity3 will not use military force under any circumstances			0
the @entity28 does n't need to release bombs to show it is powerful			2
what it needs to do is remind its adversaries , its enemies , that it has options beyond the well - appointed rooms of hotels along @entity57			0
@entity3 can do this by speaking directly and firmly about those choices			0
that alone would go a long way in reshaping some points of views , and could produce results			0
if it does n't , more concrete steps would be required , from increasing material support for specific anti-al - @entity11 forces to a tightening of sanctions against @entity24 and other steps			2
diplomats can help concentrate the mind of their interlocutors when the people on the other side of the table worry about the possible cost of failure			0
this is true of @entity1 's @entity11 , who has heard @entity3 's threats on the use of chemical weapons starting in the summer of 2012 , and is still playing games with @entity28 while relentlessly slaughtering and starving his people			1
and it is true about @entity24 , which just heard @entity3 during the @entity87 threaten to veto a plan to set the stage now for additional sanctions against @entity24 if negotiations fail in the next six months			1
@entity24 officials presumably also heard the president state what so many have stopped believing : that he is prepared " to exercise all options to make sure @entity24 does not build a nuclear weapon			1
" @entity24 foreign minister says @entity3 's remarks are for " domestic consumption " the more we hear from the @entity24 , the less likely it seems that a successful agreement can be reached			2
after @entity107 's @entity106 talked to @entity24 president @entity108 last week , he concluded there 's a " train wreck " on its way in negotiations			1
the @entity28 is moving forward on the assumption that a deal would involve the dismantling of some key nuclear facilities , but @entity108 , the moderate face of the @entity118 , made it " categorically , specifically and unequivocally " clear that @entity24 has no intention of ever rolling back its nuclear program			1
on @entity1 , i had heard rumors that the removal of its most terrifying weapons was not going as scheduled			1
then an anonymous source told @entity127 that the regime has delivered a dismal 4.1 % of the 1,300 tons of toxic agents it has reported , " and there is no sign of more , " on the way			0
then the @entity28 confirmed it			2
on thursday , ambassador @entity135 , who heads the @entity28 delegation to the @entity137 , told the group that @entity1 is ignoring the timeline for removal of banned weapons and displaying " a ' bargaining mentality ' rather than a security mentality			1
" in addition , he said , there is little progress on @entity1 's commitment to destroy its chemical weapons production facilities			1
if @entity1 's games over its chemical weapons sound familiar -- agreements followed by " misunderstandings " and endless delays -- it is because we see much the same already unfolding with @entity24			1
@entity24 's president and foreign minister are well versed in their communications strategy with the @entity160			2
they are charming and fluent , speaking directly to @entity163 publics who would like nothing better than to be done with the threat of a confrontation			0
and how great it would be to truly resolve the issue diplomatically			0
@entity169 , however , is not a strategy any more than closing your eyes when you do n't like what you see , as when @entity24 president @entity108 tweeted that in the @entity57 agreement the " world powers surrendered " to @entity24			2
that 's when the @entity178 dismissed the worrisome statement as a play for a domestic audience			0
since then , however , one after another @entity24 official has maintained they have no intention of taking apart any of their nuclear program			2
without destroying any centrifuges , reactors , or other facilities , @entity24 can negotiate with the @entity160 , and receive political , diplomatic and economic benefits from the loosening of sanctions , as it already has			2
and then , as top @entity24 officials have said , it can reverse any freeze and resume high - level enrichment in 24 hours			2
that 's the vow from the top nuclear negotiator and the foreign minister			0
making matters worse , much worse , we have just learned that @entity28 intelligence officials believe @entity24 has essentially already reached the " nuclear breakout " capability it sought			1
director of national intelligence @entity204 told @entity206 this week that @entity24 has made " technical progress in a number of areas -- including uranium enrichment , nuclear reactors , and ballistic missiles -- from which it could draw if it decided to build missile - deliverable nuclear weapons			1
" in other words , he concluded , the only thing between @entity24 and nuclear weapons is a political decision to build the bomb			1
everything else is already in place			0
that extraordinary revelation received little attention in the @entity28 , where the headlines were consumed with the crisis in ice - logged @entity226			2
in other places , the news was cause for alarm			0
" @entity233 , " tweeted a respected @entity232 journalist , " @entity24 can now build and deliver nukes			0
" how is it possible that @entity24 and @entity1 are getting away with this ? @entity24 and @entity1 are not the only countries convinced that the @entity28 will not take military action			1
@entity238 apparently has reached much the same conclusion			0
after his 2012 red lines became blurred , the deal to get rid of @entity11 's chemical weapons allowed @entity3 to claim he had succeeded in showing consequences for their use , even if @entity11 stayed in place and the killing continued			1
but now it looks as if essentially nothing has changed			0
except that tens of thousands more have died			0
to support @entity28 diplomacy , @entity3 needs to erase that image of a weak @entity28			0
again , there is no need to launch attacks and deploy troops			0
but there is a need to show to @entity28 's enemies they can not play the @entity28 for a fool			0
the president needs to assert convincingly that he will be able to exercise power if that becomes necessary			0
nothing would be more helpful to the chances for diplomatic success .			0

@entity1 has only removed about 4 % of priority one chemical weapons , @entity28 says
@entity268 : @entity1 , @entity24 seem willing to toy with the @entity28 , raising doubt about negotiations
she says @entity28 needs to make clear that it will back up its positions with action
