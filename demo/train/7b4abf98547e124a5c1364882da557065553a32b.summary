a leader of @entity1 has claimed responsibility for last week 's deadly attack by brothers @entity5 and @entity7 on the @entity9 satirical magazine @entity8			1
here 's what we know about the @entity14 extremist group			0
@entity1 has its home in @entity16 , an impoverished and troubled nation that borders @entity17 and @entity18 and eyes strife - torn @entity20 across the @entity21			1
in recent months , the @entity23 extremist group has come under pressure within @entity16 from @entity27 @entity26 rebels and government forces			1
but the @entity30 attack shows the group 's apparent continued ability to direct operations beyond @entity16 's borders			1
its influence on would - be jihadis is also widereaching , thanks to its slick , @entity41 - language online magazine , @entity42 , first published in 2010			0
as military operations in @entity46 and @entity47 have squeezed the central leadership of @entity1 , its affiliates have stepped forward as the main perpetrators of terror attacks , though recently challenged for the spotlight by @entity52			1
@entity1 chief @entity53 is @entity1 's no. 2 and has so far remained loyal to the terror network 's leader , @entity54			1
he was designated as @entity54 's global deputy in 2013			0
@entity1 late last year issued a rebuke to @entity52 -- already cut off by @entity1 's general command in february -- reflecting a certain rivalry between @entity1 and @entity52 , as the latter seeks to extend its reach beyond @entity62 and @entity63			1
some analysts say that rivalry could prompt each terror group to escalate			0
" the tension , and the competition , between @entity1 and @entity52 is tremendous , " says @entity67 at the @entity68			1
" they 're in competition for money			0
they 're in competition for recruits			0
they 're in competition for the attention of the media			0
" he said @entity1 had recently been eclipsed in the race for global impact			1
" they had n't carried out anything spectacular in quite some time , and were becoming second fiddle to their jihadi competitors in @entity52 , " he said			0
meanwhile , " @entity52 has tremendous things to point to for their success : the holding [ of ] territory ; they 've established a caliphate			0
the vast majority of foreign fighters who are traveling from around the world are flocking not to @entity1 , but to @entity52			1
" @entity1 first emerged in @entity17 in 2002 , but thanks to the efforts of the @entity17 authorities was a mostly spent force by 2005 , according to analysis from @entity102			1
it re-emerged , reinvigorated , in @entity16 in 2009 after the @entity17 outfit merged with a @entity16 @entity1 counterpart , the analysis said			1
in a video statement released a week after the bloody shooting at the magazine 's @entity30 offices , @entity1 commander @entity105 claimed full responsibility for the attack			1
" we clarify to the @entity114 world that the one who chose the target , laid the plan , financed the operation and appointed its emir , is the leadership of the organization , " he said			0
@entity122 described the @entity7 brothers as heroes , saying they not only accepted their terror assignment but " promised and fulfilled			1
" he said the arrangements for the operation had been made by the group 's late leader , radical @entity130 cleric @entity128 , " who threatens the @entity132 both in his life and after his martyrdom			1
" the attack was revenge for the magazine 's depictions of the @entity139 , he said			0
@entity122 blamed not only @entity8 , but also @entity9 and the @entity130 in his statement			0
@entity142 spokesman @entity141 said the intelligence community was working to determine the video 's authenticity			0
there have been conflicting accounts as to which of the brothers went to @entity16 -- or whether , indeed , it was both -- and how many times			1
but a senior @entity16 security source told @entity2 the @entity16 believe both were in @entity16 for about three months , starting in april 2011			1
it is unclear how much of the time the brothers spent together			0
the official added the @entity16 do not believe @entity7 attended language schools in @entity156 , as his brother had earlier			1
it is thought likely that one or both of the brothers received weapons training from @entity1 while in @entity16 and that one may have met with @entity128			1
a @entity16 journalist and researcher , @entity164 , told @entity2 he had twice met and spoken with @entity165 in the capital , @entity156 , and that @entity7 had briefly roomed there with the failed " underwear bomber " @entity168			1
investigators believe @entity7 was in @entity16 in 2011 and that when he left , he was carrying money from @entity1 earmarked to carry out attacks , a @entity130 official told @entity2			1
the investigators believe @entity1 could have provided as much as $ 20,000 but the @entity130 has n't verified the exact amount			1
@entity130 officials consider @entity1 the most dangerous branch of @entity1 , according to @entity2 terrorism analyst @entity177			2
in november , @entity1 released a statement calling on @entity179 around the world to forget their differences and renew their efforts to carry out operations against @entity130 targets , whether civilian , military or diplomatic			2
the @entity187 's @entity189 program has posted a reward of up to $ 10 million for information that brings @entity53 to justice , saying he " has provided significant support for @entity1 terrorist operations			2
" he has been a @entity197 since 2010			0
and while @entity128 was killed in a @entity130 drone strike in @entity16 in 2011 , the radical cleric 's influence lives on -- and with it a threat to the @entity130 , says @entity2 national security analyst @entity203			2
@entity204 was an influence on @entity206 , who are alleged to have killed three people in the @entity209 bombings in 2013 , @entity203 said			0
he also influenced @entity210 , who shot up an @entity213 recruiting center in @entity214 , @entity215 , killing an @entity130 soldier in 2009			0
after the attacks , @entity217 said his spiritual inspiration was @entity128			0
maj. @entity220 killed 13 people at @entity222 , @entity223 , in 2009 after sending 18 emails to @entity128 in @entity16 , a correspondence that was known to the @entity226			2
@entity204 did not direct this attack , but he was the key inspiration for @entity220			0
@entity168 's botched attempt to bring down an @entity130 jet over @entity231 in the fall of 2009 also was directed by @entity128 , @entity203 said			0
a video released by @entity1 's official media arm in december showed a short clip of @entity168 together with both @entity53 and @entity128			2
@entity1 set out its objectives in a may 2010 statement as the " expulsion of @entity239 and crusaders " from the @entity241 , the re-establishment of the @entity114 caliphate , the introduction of @entity245 , or @entity114 law , and the liberation of @entity249 lands , according to analysis from @entity102			2
this suggests the group aims to rid @entity16 and @entity17 of non-muslims and overthrow the nations ' governments , to be replaced with what it considers to be an @entity114 state			2
to that end , it has targeted foreigners and government forces in @entity16 , as well as @entity17 leaders			2
in 2009 , @entity262 , the @entity17 deputy minister of interior , survived a bomb attack carried out by an @entity1 militant			2
through its @entity42 magazine , the group also hopes to radicalize @entity179 and stoke grass - roots jihadist action in @entity272 nations , the @entity266 's report says			0
the group 's current incarnation " is widely considered to be the @entity1 regional franchise that represents the most serious international threat , " it concludes			2
@entity2 's @entity278 , @entity279 , @entity177 , @entity280 , @entity281 and @entity282 contributed to this report , as did journalist @entity284 .			0

the @entity16 - based @entity1 affiliate has played a part in several attacks against the @entity132
one or both of the @entity7 brothers are believed to have had contact with @entity1 in @entity16
