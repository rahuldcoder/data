-- the weekend massacre at an upscale shopping center in @entity3 is shining a new light on an old concern for @entity7 counterterrorism officials : the recruitment of jihadist fighters from @entity11 communities in the @entity12 , @entity13 , and @entity14			1
it 's a concern all too familiar for many @entity11 - @entity12 families in @entity17 , @entity18 , where young men have been slipping away to join the @entity21 - affiliated guerrilla group @entity20 for the past few years , sometimes in groups			1
several have died , their relatives learning of their deaths in cryptic phone calls or in messages posted online			0
one of those killed was @entity29 , who was killed fighting in @entity11			2
his uncle , @entity31 , told @entity0 that members of the city 's @entity11 community have been trying to counteract the recruitment efforts			2
" what we have learned for the last five years is we have to speak out against this , " @entity36 said			0
@entity20 breaks new ground with complex @entity42 attack in a message on its now - suspended @entity45 page , @entity20 named nine people it said were among the gunmen who stormed @entity42 's @entity48 on saturday			2
three of them were from the @entity12 and one each was from @entity13 , @entity52 and the @entity53 , it said			1
" it is n't totally surprising , given the fact that we know @entity20 has recruited in the @entity12 , " @entity0 terrorism analyst @entity54 said sunday			1
" we also know they have recruited in a number of @entity14 countries			2
" @entity54 noted that the group 's @entity45 page includes tweets in colloquial @entity64 , " the kind of @entity64 that an @entity12 , or perhaps somebody who grew up in the @entity53 , would be using			2
" @entity20 is fighting to implement a stricter form of @entity69 law in @entity11 , a struggle in which @entity3 troops have been directly involved since 2011			1
@entity3 troops wrested control of the key @entity11 port of @entity75 from the jihadists in 2012 , and @entity11 government and @entity79 troops drove the group out of its strongholds in the capital @entity83 in 2011			1
as early as 2008 , the @entity84 warned that more than a dozen youths , some of them @entity12 citizens , had left @entity17 , home to the largest @entity11 population in the @entity12			1
at least three are believed to have carried out suicide bombings in @entity11 , where an internationally backed interim government has taken tenuous root after two decades of civil war and near - anarchy			0
@entity17 ' @entity11 community " is 100 % against terror , " said @entity36			1
but he said a lot of families arrive owing " a lot of debt , " and community youth programs were " almost nil			0
" @entity20 recruiters engaged teens by providing them entertainment and role models , then " brainwashed " them , he said			0
a senior @entity106 official told @entity0 that @entity12 officials are trying to confirm whether the names released by @entity20 are @entity12 , but said they are becoming more confident @entity12 citizens were involved in the @entity3 attack			1
the official said the administration has been concerned and raising alarm bells about @entity20 recruitment in the @entity11 - @entity12 community for years and would be making decisions in coming days about additional efforts to stem the flow of recruits			1
how @entity20 picks its targets in 2010 , a federal grand jury charged 14 people in the @entity12 with aiding @entity20			2
two women in @entity123 , @entity18 , were convicted of soliciting more than $ 8,000 for the group under false pretenses , telling contributors the money was for the poor , and received 10 - and 20 - year prison terms			0
the rest of those named in the indictment had already gone overseas , including @entity133 , who became something of a jihadist rock star before falling out with the group and dying in a fratricidal ambush in 2012			0
@entity133 differed from many of the other recruits			0
he was raised a @entity140 in @entity141 , but converted to @entity69 as a young man and created rap - style recruiting videos that bridged @entity12 and @entity11 culture			1
another man , @entity145 , was sentenced to more than nine years in march after pleading guilty to aiding @entity20			0
@entity145 was a native of @entity147 who had been living in @entity149 before joining @entity20 , prosecutors said			0
he was arrested in @entity150 and transferred to @entity151 for prosecution			0
@entity0 's @entity153 contributed to this report .			0

several young @entity11 from @entity17 have died fighting for @entity20
@entity20 says @entity3 attackers came from the @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14
