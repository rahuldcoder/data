-- @entity2 vice president @entity1 arrives in @entity3 on monday on the first leg of a major week long trip to @entity6			0
@entity1 lands at a time of significant regional tension following @entity10 's announcement last week of a new " air defense identification zone " situated between @entity12 and @entity13			1
since the declaration of the air zone , @entity12 has insisted that all aircraft must submit flight plans before entering			1
the @entity2 has urged calm , and this will be a theme which @entity1 will emphasize during his visit			0
the zone includes airspace over islands , known as @entity25 in @entity13 and @entity25 in @entity12 , which both countries claim as their own			1
the dispute over these territories is not new , but has become more salient since the @entity13 government decided to nationalize them last year			0
since last week , @entity31 has recommended that @entity2 commercial aircraft report their flight plans to @entity10 , although @entity2 military aircraft continue to operate without notification			0
meanwhile , @entity13 ( which also continues to operate flights in the zone ) announced on saturday that it has asked the @entity39 organization that oversees civil aviation to examine whether the zone could undermine aviation safety			0
@entity3 's ambition here is to bring enhanced international scrutiny to this issue in a bid to undercut @entity10			2
while air zones of this nature are commonplace across the world -- @entity13 declared its own exclusion zone , which partially overlaps @entity12 's , in the late 1960s -- there is concern that @entity12 has both imposed this measure unilaterally and warned that it will take unspecified " emergency defensive measures " if aircraft do not comply with submitting flight plans ( already , it has frayed some nerves by sending fighter jets to investigate @entity2 and @entity13 aircraft in the zone )			1
whatever @entity10 's motives in declaring the zone , it will add to the growing international tide of suspicion and sometimes even outright hostility as @entity12 increasingly asserts its growing power			1
the central challenge the country faces here is that its soft power -- its ability to win the hearts and minds of other nations and influence their governments through attraction rather than coercion or payment -- has lagged far behind its hard power built on its growing economic and military might			1
in @entity13 , for instance , public favorability toward @entity12 fell from 34 % to 5 % between 2011 and 2013 , according to @entity84 , largely in response to @entity12 's new international assertiveness			1
meanwhile , in the @entity2 public favorability toward @entity12 fell to 37 % in 2013 from 51 % in 2011			2
issues such as @entity10 's alleged currency manipulation , the large size of the @entity2 trade deficit with @entity12 and the large @entity2 financial debt held by @entity10 , not to mention alleged @entity12 cybersecurity attacks on @entity2 interests , has taken its toll on @entity2 public opinion			2
with distrust of @entity12 growing , many countries in @entity97 are actively strengthening their diplomatic alliances , particularly with @entity31 , in a bid to balance @entity10 's growing economic and military strength			1
this is a political headache the new @entity12 leadership could do without and it must now think hard about how to enhance the country 's image in the world			1
most immediately , @entity10 must restart a process of addressing concerns of foreign governments about its intentions			0
here , it needs to intensify efforts to be seen as a responsible , peaceful power			0
and match this rhetoric with actions			0
president @entity116 made a good start toward this goal in his landmark summit with @entity2 president @entity120 last summer			0
he pledged to form a " new model of co-operation " and that " @entity12 and the @entity2 must find a new path ... one that is different from the inevitable confrontation and conflict between the major countries of the past			2
" as the @entity84 data indicates , @entity12 's international image would also benefit from enhanced public diplomacy to win more foreign " hearts and minds			1
" at a symbolic level , example measures might include utilizing the country 's growing capabilities in space travel for high - profile international cooperation projects			2
surveys underline that many around the world admire @entity12 's strength in science and technology			1
a related problem to be tackled is that international communications of @entity12 state institutions often lack legitimacy and credibility with foreigners			2
one solution might be expanding the numbers of non-state groups -- including from civil society networks , diaspora communities , student and academic groups and business networks -- involved in the country 's diplomatic outreach			0
for many foreign publics , there also needs to be stronger @entity12 commitment to domestic political change , transparency and concrete steps towards democratization			2
many in the international community are likely to remain wary of the country while it clamps down on its own citizens seeking domestic reform , including human rights activists			1
taken overall , the challenges ahead for @entity12 are deep - seated and will require sustained investment and significant reform			0
however , unless they are tackled , the country 's reputational problems will increasingly disable , rather than enable , its ambitions as a rising super power			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity185 .			0

@entity12 raised tensions in region by imposing a new air defense zone
@entity185 says it will add to a tide of suspicion as @entity12 asserts its growing power
he says @entity12 's soft power is lagging behind it hard power , built on military might
@entity185 suggests ways @entity12 could *improve* its engagement and image with the international community
