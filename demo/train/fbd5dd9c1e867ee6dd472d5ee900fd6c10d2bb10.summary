@entity1 , @entity0 -- it is an unusual art auction where making money is n't a great concern			2
but that is the case this weekend when a series of paintings go on the block with the purpose of drawing attention to climate change			1
this picture by @entity14 , 15 , of @entity15 is one of 26 for sale in the @entity20 's " @entity19 " auction			1
this weekend , 26 paintings with the theme of climate change will be auctioned in @entity24 to raise money for children most adversely affected by global warming			1
the " @entity19 " auction is sponsored by the @entity20 ( @entity20 ) and will spotlight the work of young artists across the globe			0
" half of the world 's population is today below 25 years of age , " said @entity31 , executive director of @entity20			1
" the auction is a way of communicating their perspective and the auction and the money is in a sense a companion benefit			0
" pre-bids have started and early indications suggest that all 26 paintings will be sold for at least the opening bid of $ 500 apiece			1
the paintings are the best of some 200,000 entries received during the past 17 years of the @entity20 's annual @entity51			1
entries came from as far afield as @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 and @entity56			0
" some of these kids were only seven , eight nine or ten years old when they painted these things " , @entity57 said			2
" the imagination and imagery is stunning ... and the humor			0
there 's one of a polar bear taking off his costume and it 's a polar bear in a bikini			2
" penguins also are featured prominently			0
fifteen - year - old @entity14 from @entity15 secured third place with his picture of penguins frolicking on a beach			0
some are tossing beach balls while others sit nearby in a fridge			0
of his picture , @entity14 says : " i have painted a scene that , though slightly extreme , gives an insight into a possible future , one where animals lose their homes and are forced to migrate to unfamiliar territories ... due to our wrong decisions , these creatures are suffering just as much as we are or more			0
@entity88 , 14 , of @entity56 strikes a more upbeat note with her painting showing the globe and people harnessing alternative forms of energy			0
" with my painting i wanted to tell people that it 's easier and better when we work together ... we together are doing it , together we can work it out , " says @entity88			2
it 's that kind of optimism about the future that the @entity20 hopes to propagate through the promotion and sale of the 26 paintings			1
another 26 paintings will join them in a traveling exhibit that will follow climate talks around the world until their climax in @entity112 in december 2009			1
the auction and exhibition are part of the new global campaign launched today ; " @entity121 to @entity122 " calls for a definitive agreement on climate change to be formed at those talks in @entity120			1
in conjunction with the campaign , the @entity20 has released results of a survey it says highlights how concerned young people are about climate change			1
the vast majority of nearly 2,000 children surveyed in five countries decisively said that climate change was a top concern : @entity134 ( 96 percent ) , @entity135 ( 91 percent ) , @entity136 ( 85 percent ) , the @entity137 ( 82 percent ) and @entity138 ( 70 percent )			1
the majority of those surveyed -- except those in @entity136 -- agreed that it was necessary to take major steps very soon : @entity134 ( 88 percent ) , @entity135 ( 81 percent ) , @entity138 ( 75 percent ) , and the @entity137 ( 61 percent )			0
in @entity136 , most thought it was necessary to take " modest " steps over the coming years ( 53 percent )			2
" children have a way of questioning established wisdom and that is part of opening up new ways of thinking and acting , " @entity57 said			2
" so i think we need to mobilize the energy and the enthusiasm and the commitment and the faith of young people to get involved in these issues			0
" live bidding for the paintings starts on saturday at 8 p.m. et at the @entity163 in @entity24			1
eager buyers outside the @entity137 are being encourage to lodge pre-bids or to participate online through @entity166 .			0
