-- a @entity2 judge on thursday set a $ 1 million bond with new restrictions on @entity5 , saying he believes the suspect may have been planning to flee the country to avoid prosecution in the killing of @entity10			1
judge @entity11 found that @entity5 's deceit over cash holdings at his first bond hearing in april was not enough to hold him without bail			1
" this court has , thus far , declined to exercise its contempt powers and the state failed to prove that the defendant may be held without bond , " the order said			2
@entity5 will have to post 10 % of the $ 1 million -- or $ 100,000 -- to meet the requirement for bail			1
timeline of events in @entity10 case but an even bigger challenge is finding a bail bond company that will work with the family on the requirement of $ 1 million in collateral , defense attorney @entity26 said later thursday			1
the family does " not have anywhere near " the collateral amount , according to the attorney			2
" we are encouraged we can work this out , " @entity26 said in a statement			0
donations to @entity5 's legal defense fund have dropped significantly while @entity5 has been jailed , @entity26 said			1
" supporters have told us they were concerned that the court would set such a high bond that getting @entity5 out of jail could risk wiping out the entire defense account			1
it appears that they were right			0
however , @entity5 needs an aggressive defense and to help with that he also needs to be out of jail with his wife and family assisting his legal team			1
" the fund has a $ 211,000 balance , but has $ 40,000 in payables for defense expenses			0
" paying bond and scheduled expenses would effectively wipe out the existing balance , " @entity26 said			0
@entity26 argued that @entity5 should not be jailed because the state 's case is weak and his claim of self - defense is strong			1
the original bail of $ 150,000 was revoked last month after @entity11 learned @entity5 and his wife , @entity63 , had failed to disclose more than $ 150,000 in donations from the public			1
the judge 's order thursday said that the new $ 1 million bond was not a punishment but an amount that assured the court that @entity5 would not abscond			1
@entity5 has the money to pay for his release , the court said			0
in his ruling , @entity11 wrote about the first bond hearing and noted an undisclosed second passport kept in @entity5 's safe deposit box			1
" notably , together with the passport , the money only had to be hidden for a short time for him to leave the country if the defendant made a quick decision to flee , " the judge said			0
" it is entirely reasonable for this court to find that , but for the requirement that he be placed on electronic monitoring , the defendant and his wife would have fled the @entity93 with at least $ 130,000 of other people 's money			2
" @entity11 wrote the defendant 's plans to flee were " thwarted			0
" @entity5 , 28 , is charged with second - degree murder in @entity10 's february 26 shooting death			2
under @entity2 law , second - degree murder is a bondable offense			0
what do you think about the judge 's order ? sound off on @entity107 prosecutors had asked for bond to be denied or , if not , for it to be set at $ 1 million			1
@entity10 family attorney @entity110 said the parents preferred that @entity5 remain in jail , but " they respect the ruling of the court and the strong message that the judge sent that deference to judicial integrity is paramount to all court proceedings			1
" " furthermore , they understand that this is not a sprint to justice , but a long journey to justice that they must bear for their son @entity127 , " @entity110 said			0
the order said the evidence shows that @entity5 and his wife acted together to conceal their cash holdings during the original bond hearing			1
" under any definition , the defendant has ( flouted ) the system , " the order said			0
" the defendant has tried to manipulate the system when he has been presented the opportunity to do so			0
" investigator : @entity5 missed opportunities to defuse situation @entity11 imposed new restrictions on @entity5 that he did not face when he was out on bond the first time			2
@entity5 must report to officials every two days , can not open or maintain a bank account and can not be on the property of an airport			0
he also can not apply for or obtain a passport			0
@entity5 must abide by a curfew from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. , and like before , will be monitored electronically			0
prosecutor @entity152 argued before the judge last week that @entity5 should remain in jail without bail because he was complicit in lying to the court and ca n't be trusted			1
forensic accountant @entity157 testified that thousands of dollars in donated funds flowed into and out of @entity5 's bank account in the days before the first bail hearing			1
@entity157 said it appeared @entity5 and his wife were speaking in code during recorded jailhouse telephone conversations about the amount of money involved			2
he also said that transferring funds between accounts could have been done to make it appear that @entity5 had less money available for bail than he did			0
@entity171 reiterated that prosecutors believe @entity10 , a 17 - year - old @entity173 , was an innocent victim who was confronted by @entity5 without provocation			2
@entity5 , a @entity175 neighborhood watch volunteer , acknowledged fatally shooting the unarmed @entity10 after calling police to report a suspicious person			0
@entity5 , who is white and @entity178 , said @entity10 attacked him			0
@entity5 : @entity10 threatened my life @entity0 's @entity181 and @entity182 contributed to this report .			2
