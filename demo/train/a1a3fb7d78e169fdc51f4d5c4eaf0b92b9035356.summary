@entity0 , @entity1 -- on the fifth day of every month , the loved ones of soldiers killed and wounded in the @entity0 shootings last year make sure to think positive thoughts instead of dwelling on the carnage of last november 5			1
" we call ourselves a family ; that 's how we cope , " @entity8 , the fiance of wounded staff sgt. @entity9 , told @entity2 on monday			1
" we mark the fifth of every month			0
instead of using that to mark something tragic , we try to use that day to mark our accomplishments and our feats			0
" on tuesday , @entity8 and the others will finally learn more about what happened last november when the alleged gunman , @entity21 maj. @entity20 , is wheeled into a military courtroom for the start of a hearing to determine if he 'll be court - martialed			1
@entity20 , 40 , is accused of killing 13 people and wounding 32 in the shooting spree at this sprawling @entity21 post			1
he 's paralyzed from the upper chest down after civilian police shot him four times			0
the @entity33 , like a civilian grand jury , will consider the evidence against @entity20 and decide whether the case will move forward to a court - martial that could bring the death penalty			1
unlike a grand jury , the hearing is open to the public , and both the defense and prosecution can present witnesses and evidence			0
@entity21 prosecutors have refused to speak publicly about the case or release a witness list			0
they are expected to call every person wounded in the shootings , as well as others , to provide a second - by - second account of what happened on november 5 , 2009			2
@entity52 , @entity20 's civilian attorney , had wanted the hearing closed to the public , but his motion was denied			1
@entity20 , a @entity56 - born citizen of @entity58 descent , faces 13 counts of first - degree murder for allegedly opening fire at the @entity62 at @entity0 , killing 12 soldiers and a civilian			1
he also is charged with 32 counts of attempted premeditated murder for the 30 military personnel and two civilians wounded at the center , where soldiers prepare to deploy for @entity71 and @entity72			1
the shootings at the nation 's largest army post , in central @entity1 between @entity76 and @entity77 , shocked the nation and raised questions about whether a so - called homegrown terrorist had operated within the military system without detection			0
the @entity33 hearing is not expected to provide answers to why @entity20 , who had communicated with a known @entity86 extremist and made anti- @entity56 comments , was promoted nonetheless			1
at the time of the shootings , @entity20 was scheduled to deploy to @entity71 , military officials said			2
the @entity91 has said it was aware of communication between @entity20 and @entity94 , a @entity95 - @entity56 cleric who has promoted jihad against the @entity56 and other @entity98 countries			1
but investigators had determined those contacts were " consistent with research being conducted by @entity102			0
" clerics at the @entity104 in @entity105 , @entity106 -- which @entity20 attended when he lived in the area -- described him as a loner			2
@entity109 said they were not successful in finding him a wife , and @entity111 said some people believed @entity20 changed after his mother 's death in 2001			2
@entity52 , a longtime military lawyer who now defends accused soldiers , said @entity20 spends his days on base in bed			2
he has a quran and can watch television , and a pail in his cell serves as his bathroom , the attorney said			0
legal jockeying so far indicates the @entity33 hearing will be contentious			0
last week , @entity52 said he instructed @entity20 not to cooperate with a government - ordered psychiatric evaluation			1
col. @entity128 , the officer overseeing the case , had indicated in january that the military would not " meet with , test or examine " @entity20 until after the @entity33 hearing			1
but in a recent memo obtained by @entity2 , @entity128 said he reversed his decision after the defense said in court last month that it may introduce mental capacity evidence for consideration in the case			2
@entity52 denied the defense had made such a statement			0
the hearing could stretch into november , with the prosecution set to present its case through october 29 , followed by a one - week recess when @entity0 will mark the first anniversary of the shootings , referred to by some as " 5/11			2
" on monday , a federal holiday with the base closed to journalists , there was little attention being paid to the upcoming hearing			0
a front - page story in the @entity153 with the headline " @entity20 's @entity155 " was dwarfed by stories on frozen @entity158 benefits and delays in federal aid involving @entity161			1
soldiers showed little interest in talking about the shootings or the suspect , refusing to give their names and offering only brief responses that indicated they want the whole thing to be over			0
for @entity8 , the hearing is the first step of what she believes will be a long process to bring justice to the victims , including @entity9 , who was hospitalized for 10 months in @entity1 and @entity175			0
with all the attention on @entity20 as the hearing approached , she said she " cringed " at how some of those wounded in the shootings struggled alone and unnoticed			1
@entity2 's @entity181 contributed to this report .			0
