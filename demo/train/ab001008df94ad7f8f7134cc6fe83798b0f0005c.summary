why do @entity1 " speak out " and " condemn " violent acts with which they have no connection , and why do others , across the political spectrum , expect it ? people should demand public statements like , " i condemn this act , " from those who have some kind of accountability in connection with the act			1
there is always a crucial line between feeling revulsion at a crime and feeling it necessary to dissociate oneself from that crime			0
did you benefit from a crime ? could you have stopped the crime ? did you contribute , even unwittingly , to the crime ? if so , you may have to stand up and denounce it			0
in connection with the recent @entity31 killings , some mainstream commentators such as @entity28 columnist @entity27 ask why " moderate " @entity1 can not simply " come out and say " that " i do not support this			1
" former congressman @entity34 writes that he wishes that @entity1 would " speak out more strongly			2
" such liberal commentary is not substantially different from @entity37 's tweet that @entity1 like myself " must be held responsible			1
" they should know that groups like @entity40 and @entity41 believe fanatically that most @entity1 are misguided and hell - bound , and that only a small group ( themselves ) are members of an exclusive " saved sect , " a belief that makes them immune to critique			1
any condemnations they receive from the wayward @entity1 majority only entrenches them in this belief			2
moreover , it is @entity1 themselves who stand to lose the most when crimes are committed by these vigilantes			2
the vast majority of victims of jihadist groups are other @entity1 , and when an attack takes place in the @entity57 it is the @entity1 community that suffers the backlash from the societies in which they live			1
worst of all , @entity1 offer the much sought - after condemnations all the time			1
just type " @entity1 condemn " into a search engine			1
if the goal of our detractors were really to get @entity1 to do more " speaking out , " then what @entity1 have already done would have been enough years ago			2
this is really about political statements and maintaining a certain social hierarchy			0
demanding that innocent @entity1 always make new statements about crimes they could not have stopped , from which they do not benefit , and have always condemned anyway , is an act by the powerful assigning collective guilt against the powerless			0
the critics who want @entity1 to " speak out " only grow more demanding when @entity1 actually do speak out , because by doing so @entity1 have publicly affirmed the right of others to blame them collectively , regardless of whether they are accountable or not			0
such political manuevers -- and that is what they really are -- increase the leverage that can be exerted over @entity1 in public life			0
@entity1 voices are thus uniquely kept out of view unless they are apologizing for some atrocity they had nothing to do with			0
in the case of the @entity88 massacre , @entity1 were asked not only to condemn murder ( which they did ) but also to champion a " free speech " that took the form of denigrating their sacred beliefs ( which they deplored )			1
for @entity34 , this refusal to follow the script was to " condone their terrible acts with qualified condemnation " while @entity27 laments our use of , " yes , but			0
" @entity1 are thus tarred as being sympathetic with murder if they point out that the very publication that portrayed the @entity102 so grotesquely had fired an editor , who was later taken to court , for quipping that @entity106 's son converted to @entity107 because of social ambition			1
@entity1 have no duty to celebrate a general hypocrisy that singles them out for ill treatment			0
not approving of the murder is quite enough			0
it is possible to consider the cartoonists at @entity88 to be vile people who did not deserve to die			0
it is worth remembering that the perpetrators of crimes such as the @entity88 massacre are always screaming " revenge ! " but @entity57 commentators choose to dwell on what innocent @entity1 are going to do about it , or whether @entity124 is to blame			2
why do they not instead ask , as @entity126 writer @entity125 chose not to do , " revenge for what ? " do they fear they might bring to light crimes , much greater crimes , that they themselves should have " spoken out " about long ago ? perhaps it is more comfortable to keep the conversation focused on @entity1 and their religion than it is to investigate whether one 's own country or one 's own group has anything it might have to " condemn			1

some mainstream commentators have urged moderate @entity1 to condemn terrorism , in particular the recent @entity31 killings
@entity143 says though that groups like @entity40 and @entity41 believe fanatically that most @entity1 are misguided and hell - bound
for many , it 's more comfortable to focus on @entity1 than to ask if one 's own country may have anything to " condemn , " @entity143 adds
