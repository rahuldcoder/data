assaults on the headquarters of the @entity5 , which governs @entity6			1
these are among the signs that @entity6 faces challenges on several fronts as it struggles to craft a new nation from the ashes of tyranny			1
almost a year after the @entity6 uprising erupted in the eastern city of @entity16 , the nation ruled by @entity17 for four long decades is discovering -- the hard way -- the thorny side of nation building			1
prime minister @entity21 acknowledged @entity6 's difficult journey in a national address wednesday , calling on people to help the government deal with an inheritance from one of the " strangest and most complicated regimes in history			1
" that -- coupled with months of violence and bloodshed -- has added to the fledgling state 's disarray			1
they want trust , transparency			2
and they want to see immediate progress			2
their frustration has surfaced in protests in several @entity6 cities over the last few days , most notably in @entity16 , the seat of the revolution , where @entity6 stormed the @entity5 building			1
there has also been a recent flare - up in violence			2
clashes between pro- and @entity51 forces have turned lethal			2
and the nation is still struggling to establish rule of law			2
human rights monitors sounded alarms again this week after several detainees died of abuse			0
@entity6 's problems far outweigh the capacity of the new leadership to deal with them , said longtime @entity6 observer @entity62 , author of " @entity63			1
" " there are no easy solutions here , " he said			0
a key issue at hand is the legitimacy and authority of the transitional council			0
the governing body does not have physical control over a nation fragmented along regional and tribal lines			2
and it was mainly self - appointed , not elected to power by a popular vote			0
" there is no full trust in the government , " former rebel fighter @entity78 told the @entity80 ' humanitarian news agency @entity79			0
@entity6 detainees died after torture , rights group says he , like many other @entity6 who are fearful that their revolution will be compromised , said he would not surrender his weapon until elections , set for june			1
@entity91 said he understood the impatience of @entity6 in wanting to see the aims of the revolution implemented quickly			1
but he tempered his remarks with a good dose of caution			0
" the revolution happened for freedom , the freedom of expression and peaceful protest and that is a guaranteed right for all citizens , " he said			0
" but it is important that these demonstrations happen in a civilized manner and after all other means and efforts have been used			0
we are in a battle to rebuild and every day of work that is wasted is a delay and an obstacle to our march			0
" @entity91 said security and stability remained a priority for the @entity5			0
chief among the concerns is how best to rein in the former fighters with disparate loyalties and agendas			0
in the months since @entity17 's capture and death , @entity6 has been mired in fighting between rival militias and tribes			1
in @entity130 this week , the powerful @entity129 tribe drove out @entity132 forces , regaining control of the former @entity17 stronghold			0
@entity136 political scientist @entity135 traveled to @entity6 last fall to advise the @entity5			1
he said he had been optimistic about @entity6 's prospects but is less so now , given what he perceived as the interim council 's decision - making inertia			1
" the genie is out of the bottle and that means the armed groups are the dominant political players , " he said			0
" the people making decisions are the ones with guns			0
" @entity91 said the government plans to integrate 75,000 former fighters into security services and other jobs and the rest would go through rehabilitation and vocational training			0
he also announced a monthly monetary allowance for the former rebels to sign up for training			0
such rewards , @entity135 said , are imperative to bring under control a nation where doctors , lawyers and businessmen all picked up weapons to fight @entity17			2
" a lot of the paramilitaries are civilians who became that , " @entity135 said			0
" so it 's possible to reintegrate them but they need to be given an incentive			2
" in that climate , issues of national reconciliation and justice have become grave concerns for human rights monitors			0
several detainees have died amid widespread torture and ill - treatment of suspected @entity185 fighters and loyalists , @entity180 said thursday			1
" after all the promises to get detention centers under control , it is horrifying to find that there has been no progress to stop the use of torture , " said @entity187 , @entity180 's senior crisis adviser in @entity6			1
the monitoring group said the torture was carried out by " officially recognized military and security entities as well by a multitude of armed militias operating outside any legal framework			2
" the @entity180 allegations came as the medical charity @entity202 said thursday it was halting work in detention centers in @entity206 because detainees are " tortured and denied urgent medical care			1
" the agency , known by its @entity211 acronym @entity202 , said it has treated 115 people with torture - related wounds from interrogation sessions			2
the @entity80 @entity215 , meanwhile , heard about @entity6 's woes this week from the global body 's top official in that country			1
@entity80 @entity221 @entity220 said it was " urgent that all detention centers are brought under the control of the @entity225 and the @entity226			0
" " moreover , a structure and process for judicial screening of detainees should be in place immediately , " she said			0
the top @entity80 envoy in @entity6 told the council that the nation was going through a difficult transition			1
" the former regime may have been toppled , but the harsh reality is that the @entity6 people continue to have to live with its deep - rooted legacy ; weak , at times absent , state institutions , coupled with the long absence of political parties and civil society organizations , which render the country 's transition more difficult , " said @entity237 , head of the @entity238 in @entity6			1
scholars who have been watching @entity6 for many years give the @entity5 an " a " for effort but agree that @entity6 's new leaders have a tough road ahead			1
" they are in a terribly difficult situation , " @entity62 said			0
" they are starting from ground zero			1
