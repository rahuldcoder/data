-- when kiteboarding was given the @entity5 seal of approval earlier this year , the brightest stars in the sport were faced with some life - changing decisions			1
would they continue as semi-professionals who sail for fun , or quit their day jobs and focus all their time and energy to qualify for the @entity13 in @entity14 -- with a good shot at winning gold ? for the current world number one male and female kiteboard racers -- @entity18 and @entity19 -- the news that the @entity21 ( @entity21 ) had made their sport of choice an @entity5 event was met with both celebration and contemplation			1
@entity19 , from the @entity27 , has been kiteboarding -- or kitesurfing as it 's also known -- for over ten years			1
for her , the decision to try and go pro after the @entity5 announcement was easy			1
she was part of the team that went to @entity35 to convince @entity21 that kiteboarding was a worthy @entity5 contender , and she has her heart set on making the @entity27 national team in four years time			1
" my first goal is to qualify , and then i want to go to the @entity5 and win a medal			1
it would be the most beautiful thing , " said the 31 - year - old , who became the highest - ranking female kiteboard racer last year , according to the @entity44 ( @entity44 )			2
since completing university , @entity19 has been working a full time job for an internet provider in @entity50 -- training in the evenings and during the weekends			2
she even started putting in overtime every week to save enough time off to travel to the best and biggest ranking kireboarding tournaments around the world			0
but juggling a career and a competitive sport at the toughest international level is not an easy task , which is why @entity19 has decided to quit her job this month			2
" if you want to be able to continue to be number one and win the @entity5 , you have to dedicate more time to the sport			1
i might keep working one day a week to keep developing my career -- but i know this is what i have to do to have a chance to go to @entity14 , and i do n't want to miss that chance , " she said			1
watch : fastest man on the water since @entity21 announced that the sport would be featured in the @entity13 , @entity19 has noticed a swell of interest from sponsors -- and quitting her job is all part of the plan to get a good sponsorship deal , enabling her to commit to the sport she loves			1
@entity83 number one @entity18 has also had sponsors knocking on his door			0
the 23 - year - old @entity86 grew up sailing and windsurfing in @entity89 , and although he is " super excited " about the prospect of competing in the @entity5 and will " definitely keep going " to try and qualify for 2016 , he is in no rush to resign from his day job just yet			1
@entity93 works as a mechanical engineer for a company that specializes -- rather fittingly -- in kite - powered wind energy			2
it just so happens that his boss is also an avid kiteboarder , and allows him time off to go to races when needed			0
" the boss is pretty stoked with what i am doing , so i am lucky in that respect , " said @entity18			0
" i think for now it 's nice to be able to go home and not have to think of every race over and over again , to go to the office and keep a little bit of reality , " he added			0
both @entity19 and @entity93 believe @entity21 's decision will have a big impact on the future of kiteboarding			0
on the whole , @entity93 thinks the changes to the sport will be positive -- but he is adamant that any significant alterations must " be done right			2
" " there is that saying : ' the quickest way of killing a class is to make it an olympic class ' -- and that 's definitely not what we want , " he said			0
the quest to make the @entity5 more exhilarating to a younger audience -- while ensuring that new sports are not altered too much -- is a challenge			1
however , both @entity93 and @entity19 believe kiteboarding has enough of a " cool - factor " to pull in the younger crowds without too much tinkering			0
" kiteboarding has always been cool and it 's a fast growing sport , " said @entity19			2
" incorporating expression sports like snowboarding and kiteboarding definitely helps change the image of the @entity5 , " she said			1
watch : investing in a winning team indeed , the sport was developed in the 1990s and has rocketed in popularity over the last few years			0
@entity44 executive secretary @entity142 estimates there are more than 1.5 million participants globally -- with 100,000 new learners joining every year			1
according to the @entity44 , there are currently five categories of kiteboarding : wave , freestyle , slalom , speed and course racing			1
both @entity19 and @entity153 compete in " course racing " , which was the category selected by @entity21 as an @entity5 sport			1
" course racing " is very similar to sailing 's " fleet racing " and during a regatta it is common to have 60 or more kiteboarders cluster around a course at dramatic speeds			0
the most important elements of course racing are the ability to generate and control the speed -- often exceeding 50 knots or more -- and tactical understanding , something which both the world number ones learned at a young age while sailing traditional boats			1
watch : a modern race with a classic design @entity19 spent " every weekend sailing " with her parents around the @entity27 , while @entity153 raced skiffs for most of his life until he decided to focus solely on kiteboarding during his time at university			0
" what i love about kiteboarding is that it is super fun and i still play around a lot when i practice , " said @entity153 , who admits he did n't find sailing much fun in the end			0
" i think a lot of it has to do with eliminating tons of logistical aspects of sailing			0
i used to have to have my boat somewhere , have my crew there , have three other boats to train with and wherever your gear was based you had to travel to , " he said			0
" but now i can just get up in the morning , pick what beach i want to train on , put my gear in the back of the car , and after a few text messages you know you will have an amazing fleet of kiteboarders to go out there and sail with			0
making it easy makes it fun , " he added			0
for @entity19 , the thrill of kiteboarding is primal : " because you are using the wind and the water , every second and every day is different -- you have to adjust yourself to nature 's elements			2
you can use these things to do anything you want -- jump high into the air , speed up or just cruise			2
for me kiteboarding is ultimate freedom			0
