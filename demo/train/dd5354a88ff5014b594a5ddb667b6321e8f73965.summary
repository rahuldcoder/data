for nearly seven weeks , the @entity1 public knew alleged police killer @entity2 from a handful of images -- showing a seemingly clean - cut young man , sometimes dressed in a @entity7 - era uniform and carrying a gun			1
but this week , they got a different glimpse of @entity2			1
the bridge of his nose was cut and bloodied			0
and he wore an orange jail jumpsuit			0
the new uniform is because of what happened thursday , when a team of @entity1 marshals took the 31 - year - old survivalist and military buff into custody at an abandoned airport near @entity25 , @entity26			1
as to the suspect 's abrasions , @entity29 -- who took down @entity2 , accompanied by about a dozen other marshals -- told @entity32 they came about when these authorities tried to detain @entity2 and avoid the firefight many feared			1
" we 're not playing around , " @entity29 said			2
capturing a dangerous fugitive authorities have acknowledged @entity2 got special treatment in some ways			2
after his arrest , he was shackled in the handcuffs of @entity26 state police cpl. @entity42 -- the officer that authorities say @entity2 killed on september 12 -- put in the backseat of the slain trooper 's squad car , then sent back to the barracks where the ambush on @entity42 occurred			1
that 's not possible for every accused convict			0
opinion : were cops out of line in trooper - killing arrest ? but @entity29 said that @entity2 was n't treated differently -- at least differently than anyone on the @entity58 's @entity57 considered armed and dangerous , after having allegedly killed one officer and wounded another before melting into the woods -- while being taken into custody			1
when authorities approached @entity2 , the suspect had his chest down on the ground but his head was up looking at @entity29 , the marshal said			1
from a law enforcement perspective , that is just what you do n't want			0
" never have a fugitive look at you , " @entity29 explained			0
per law enforcement protocol , @entity2 was forced to be face - first on the asphalt looking away from the marshals ( so that a suspect ca n't anticipate an officer 's next move )			1
in the process , his nose got cut and his face scraped			2
" sometimes things like that happen , " @entity29 said			0
most - wanted suspect taken into custody an end to a tense 48 days the @entity1 marshal told @entity32 affiliate @entity91 that his first sign of @entity2 came in the form of movement through nearby high grass and weeds			1
" when i first saw him , i was like , ' what 's this guy doing in the field by himself ? ' " @entity29 recalled saturday			0
" for a split second , i did n't think it was him			0
" but then we had a sixth sense , i guess			0
i knew it was him			0
" and so @entity29 and his team of marshals got closer , without the suspect apparently not knowing			0
until , that is , @entity2 turned around and saw the law enforcement officers approaching him			2
" i told him to get on the ground ... , " @entity29 said			0
" we just kept closing distance ( to ) about 5 feet away			0
" i said , ' who are you ? what 's your name ? ' and he said , ' @entity2			1
' " so ended the manhunt that terrorized many in northeast @entity26 over a tense 48 - day stretch -- closing schools , canceling outdoor activities and prompting the halt to hunting and trapping			1
as many as 1,000 federal , state and local law enforcement officers scoured forests and thoroughfares looking for @entity2			2
@entity133 returns to northeast @entity26 after manhunt ends authorities worried they would get the worst from an armed man with a reported history of police hatred , a man who had lashed out violently before and got away			2
in fact , while @entity2 was n't armed at the time of his capture , investigators later found a cache nearby that included a sniper rifle			1
the @entity147 team that spotted @entity2 was well - aware of the worst - case scenarios when they went after him			1
yet , @entity29 said , " that 's what the marshals do			0

a @entity1 marshal recalls the capture of @entity2 at an abandoned @entity26 airport
he first saw movement in high grass , after which he and others approached @entity165
@entity2 cut his face while face - first on asphalt ; " we 're not playing around , " marshal say
the marshal *downplays* the danger , saying it 's " our job " to " hunt fugitives " like @entity2
