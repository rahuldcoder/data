-- speaking at a press conference in @entity3 on monday , @entity1 said he had received the following instruction from @entity6 leader @entity5 when they were together the previous week : " @entity1 , i want you to go over to @entity9 and say , ' guess what , we want people to come over here , because we are not a bad country			1
' " according to @entity1 , " he likes me because i am very true and very honest			1
" @entity5 let the @entity9 hold his only child , a baby girl			2
he also allowed @entity1 to tell him " your grandfather and your father did some bad things , " which can not be something @entity5 hears very often			2
