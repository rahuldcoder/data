@entity0 , @entity1 -- in all his years in power , @entity3 has never been portrayed as anything but regal in paintings and statues scattered throughout @entity1			1
six months into @entity1 's war , some artists in rebel strongholds are arming themselves with fresh paint			1
their belief ? a brush can be as mighty as the kalashnikov in the fight against the strongman			1
" everybody supports the revolution in some way , " says @entity17 , formerly a bulldozer driver			2
" some people fight , i use the brush			1
" in @entity25 , a massive mural of @entity3 remains intact			1
@entity17 's work is far less flattering			0
his caricatures of @entity3 sucking on his country 's oil reserves , pinned down by a rebel flag and being launched out of @entity1 on a bomb -- are everywhere around his hometown of @entity33 in the country 's western mountains			1
" building owners welcome it , " he says			0
" not one single person said no. i get a lot of support			0
" several miles away in the rebel - controlled city of @entity0 , @entity41 is also using art as weapon			1
he was a calligrapher before the uprising began in @entity1 last february			1
now , he revels in his new career			0
each of his paintings , he says , expresses @entity3 's persecution of the @entity1 people			1
one portrays @entity3 as a vampire sucking the wealth of the people			1
" he has not left anything for them , he kept us illiterate , without education , " @entity41 says			0
" he kept everything for himself			0
" some of the paintings are humorous			2
some make strong political commentary			2
all are new in a nation where freedom of expression was an unknown under @entity3			2
" now we can express ourselves freely , thank god , " @entity41 says			0
" the chains have been lifted			0
even a simple painting about the tyrant , now we can paint			0
before the revolution we could not do that , he would arrest and in some cases kill us			0
" @entity17 and his assistant , calligrapher @entity78 , bear sizzling daytime temperatures to create their latest fresco -- " @entity82 " beckoning rebel fighters to come and join her in @entity25			2
" what i have inside i can now express and put it on the walls , " @entity17 says			0
in this particular expression , he has , perhaps , captured the heart of the @entity1 rebels , fighting bitterly to make it @entity25 .			2

political art is springing up in rebel - held areas of @entity1
