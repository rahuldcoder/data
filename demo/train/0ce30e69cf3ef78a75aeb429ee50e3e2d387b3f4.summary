-- president @entity2 's vision of a new " @entity4 moment " for the @entity5 carried echoes of a new " @entity7			1
" if not the @entity10 - era agenda , at least the song by @entity12 co-founder @entity11			2
or perhaps another @entity11 tune , " @entity29 , " with its visions of trains of " graphite and glitter " and cities powered by the sun. @entity2 coupled his pitch with an appeal to a nation groaning under an unemployment rate over 9 percent -- a vision of new technologies , fostered in part by government investment , bringing new jobs			2
hearkening back to the stunning 1957 news that the @entity31 had beaten @entity5 into space by launching the first artificial satellite into @entity35 orbit , @entity2 said the @entity5 " had no idea " how to respond at first			1
" the science was n't even there yet			2
@entity42 did n't exist , " he said in his @entity41 speech tuesday night			1
" but after investing in better research and education , we did n't just surpass the @entity31 ; we unleashed a wave of innovation that created new industries and millions of new jobs			1
" fact check : what did the @entity51 do for the economy ? -- @entity55 , according to most experts			0
the space program helped spur the miniaturization of electronics that fueled the computer revolution and spawned the @entity60			0
other products whose development has been linked to the space program range from cordless drills to car navigation systems			0
-- the @entity5 semiconductor industry grew rapidly from its origins in the late 1940s , " greatly aided " by @entity42 and similar military technology , a 1983 @entity71 analysis of the industry noted			1
today , the industry boasts @entity5 sales of $ 115 billion and employs more than 200,000 people , according to the @entity76			2
-- the commercial satellite industry , meanwhile , was nonexistent before the 1960s			0
by 2003 , commercial space revenue had topped $ 90 billion in businesses that employed more than 576,000 people , according to a 2005 paper for the @entity82			0
-- at a 2009 conference in @entity88 , @entity86 space policy researcher @entity85 estimated the space economy at $ 250 billion , roughly half of which was commercial			0
but he said the true size was difficult to calculate			0
bottom line : @entity2 is correct in describing the space program as a boost to nascent @entity5 industries			1
but the goal he set tuesday night is just the first stage in what is likely to be a tough debate about the role of government in the economy			1
@entity0 's @entity102 and @entity103 contributed to this report .			0

@entity2 says the @entity5 " unleashed a wave of innovation " after @entity4
he called for a similar push in his @entity41 address tuesday night
