a federal judge in @entity2 has temporarily blocked president @entity4 's executive action on immigration , which has drawn opposition from 26 states across the nation			1
@entity10 district judge @entity9 ruled late monday night to block executive actions @entity4 took late last year to shield as many as 5 million undocumented immigrants from deportation			1
in delaying the ruling , @entity9 halted @entity4 's executive action , ruling that the administration had failed to comply with the @entity17 , which calls for the @entity18 to afford a longer notification and comment period before taking action			1
the @entity18 said in a statement early tuesday that @entity4 's actions " are well within his legal authority " and that the @entity25 has indicated " that it will appeal that decision			1
" " the district court 's decision wrongly prevents these lawful , commonsense policies from taking effect , " the @entity18 said in a statement			0
" the @entity32 and @entity33 have made clear that the federal government can set priorities in enforcing our immigration laws — which is exactly what the president did when he announced commonsense policies to help fix our broken @entity4 said tuesday he 's confident that a @entity2 court 's injunction against his executive order delaying deportations for millions of immigrants will ultimately be overruled , and is preparing to implement the order under that assumption			1
" the @entity49 will continue with the planning because we want to make sure that as soon as these legal issues get resolved — which i anticipate they will , in our favor — that we are ready to go , " he told reporters			0
attorney general @entity56 called the ruling just an " interim step " in a legal process that will take some time to play out			1
" this is a decision by one federal district court judge , " @entity56 said tuesday at the @entity60 , adding that the @entity25 is reviewing the ruling to determine the next step			2
secretary of homeland security @entity65 , whose department would be responsible for implementing the executive orders , said he " strongly " disagrees with the judge 's decision			1
@entity65 said his department would comply with the injunction while the appeals process plays out and his department will not launch the @entity76 expansion on wednesday , as previously scheduled			0
" we fully expect to ultimately prevail in the courts , and we will be prepared to implement @entity79 and expanded @entity76 once we do , " @entity65 said			0
@entity4 's decision to act unilaterally in november drew the ire of @entity82 who immediately slammed the president 's actions as unconstitutional and conservatives have now been waging a battle in @entity33 to tie funding for the @entity49 to killing @entity4 's immigration orders			1
the programs at issue are deferred action programs for undocumented parents of @entity10 and lawful residents and expansions to the program protecting illegal immigrants who arrived in the @entity10 as children -- known as @entity79 and @entity76 , respectively			0
neither program had gone into effect			0
@entity9 issued the injunction after concluding that at least @entity2 has standing in federal court to pursue its lawsuit as @entity2 " stands to suffer direct damages from the implementation of @entity79			0
" he also argues that @entity4 's executive action goes beyond the scope of prosecutorial discretion by " bestowing benefits , " which is more than " non-enforcement			2
" " @entity111 seriously doubts that the @entity32 , in holding non-enforcement decisions to be presumptively unreviewable , anticipated that such " non-enforcement " decisions would include the affirmative act of bestowing multiple , otherwise unobtainable benefits upon an individual , " @entity9 wrote			0
@entity9 's decision monday came after @entity2 led 25 other states in a federal lawsuit to stop the executive action , and officials swiftly welcomed the judge 's decision			1
" this decision is a victory for the rule of law in @entity10 and a crucial first step in reining in president @entity4 's lawlessness , " @entity2 attorney general @entity124 said in a statement			1
and @entity82 sen. @entity82 of @entity2 , who has championed efforts in @entity33 to undo @entity4 's executive action , welcomed the news on @entity134 , calling the decision a " huge victory for rule of law			1
" @entity2 's senior sen. @entity138 , also a @entity82 , said in a statement tuesday that the ruling " reinforces " what he and other opponents have claimed , " that president @entity4 acted outside the law			1
" " today 's victory is an important one , but the fight to reverse the president 's unconstitutional overreach is not over , " @entity138 said			0
" the president must respect the rule of law and fully obey the court 's ruling			2
" but the @entity4 administration and supporters of the immigration orders were quick to counter conservative glee			1
@entity4 and his staff have long argued that the president has the legal right to take action , saying he only acted because @entity33 failed to pass immigration reform			2
immigration activists were quick to characterize the court injunction as a just " a bump in the road			2
" " we 've hit a speed bump on the road to the implementation of these programs , but folks should stay the course , get their documents ready , prepare to apply , because the programs will open their doors eventually , " said @entity166 , managing attorney of the @entity167			0
@entity177 , managing director of @entity178 we dream , insisted that the federal ruling would not stand and said @entity9 , a conservative appointed by president @entity181 , " has become known as an advocate for the harsh treatment of immigrant families			0
" " executive action protecting immigrant youth and parents is solid , " @entity177 said in a statement			0
" judge @entity9 's ruling is not permanent and we are confident that it will be repealed in a higher court			2
" the @entity2 - led coalition of states in the legal challenge are @entity195 , @entity196 , @entity197 , @entity198 , @entity199 , @entity200 , @entity201 , @entity202 , @entity203 , @entity204 , @entity205 , @entity206 , @entity207 , @entity208 , @entity209 , @entity210 , @entity211 , @entity212 , @entity213 , @entity214 , @entity215 , @entity216 , @entity2 , @entity217 , @entity218 and @entity219			0
