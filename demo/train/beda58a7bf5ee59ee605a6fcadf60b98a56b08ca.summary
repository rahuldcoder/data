-- as debt - ridden @entity2 braces for strikes while its prime minister attempts to reassure @entity6 that his country will pay its bills , the 17 eurozone countries are in various stages of deciding whether to approve the expansion of @entity6 's bailout fund			1
the proposed enhancements to the @entity13 would allow the fund to increase its lending capacity from â ‚ ¬ 250 billion to â ‚ ¬ 440 billion and buy sovereign bonds in capital markets -- a strategy designed to prop up debt prices and help struggling eurozone countries fund themselves			0
@entity6 's leaders originally hoped that the @entity13 would never have to be used ; now they are hoping the fund 's new powers will be enough to prevent the collapse of the eurozone			2
first they will have to pass the measures			0
here 's a rundown of where the countries stand and the dates their governments approved ( or are expected to approve ) @entity13 expansion			1
yet to approve @entity34 -- september 29 the @entity34 parliament passed one of two necessary resolutions to ratify @entity13 expansion earlier this week , despite attempts by the country 's main opposition party to block the changes on the grounds that one of the eurozone 's poorer states simply can not afford to help bailout failing eurozone economies			1
final approval is expected on thursday			0
@entity50 -- october 3 - 7 @entity50 joined @entity51 in its demand that @entity2 put up collateral in exchange for any additional bailout money that @entity50 would pay into the @entity13			0
but it is unclear whether @entity50 will join the @entity51 in dropping that requirement before passing @entity13 enhancement			2
either way , approval and ratification of any proposed plan can not happen until lawmakers return from recess on october 3			0
@entity65 -- october 3 - 7 once opposed to expanding the rescue fund , the @entity65 are now expected to approve enhanced @entity13 measures with a parliamentary vote by the end of the first week of october -- although hardliners in the government continue to call for the private sector to take on more of the debt burden			1
@entity74 -- october 3 - 7 the @entity74 cabinet has approved the measures and parliament is expected to ratify the @entity13 expansion sometime during the first week of october			1
@entity79 -- mid to late october one of the eurozone 's poorest countries is also the biggest obstacle to enhancing the @entity13 -- and members of the governing coalition 's refusal to approve the plan means a parliamentary vote may not happen until mid-october			1
@entity88 -- end of october while @entity88 has n't officially approved @entity13 expansion , it is expected to within weeks -- the cash - strapped country is , after all , receiving financial assistance from the bailout fund			1
already approved @entity96 -- september 29 the @entity96 @entity97 approved the expansion of the @entity13 by a vote of 523 - 85 -- a huge majority and an important victory for chancellor @entity102 , who has led calls for the bailout fund to be enhanced			2
approval of @entity13 expansion measures by @entity6 's largest economy -- and largest holder of @entity2 debt -- was seen as necessary for the bailout fund 's future success			1
@entity51 -- september 28 one of the most vocal opponents of @entity13 enhancement in the early going , @entity51 has now dropped its demand that @entity2 put up some cash collateral in return for its approval -- a requirement that threatened to derail the bailout fund expansion and further destabilize global markets			1
by a vote of 103 - 66 , the @entity51 @entity121 approved the measures wednesday , despite the absence of any agreement over its demand for collateral			0
@entity128 -- september 27 despite a no - confidence vote that brought down @entity128 's government last week , the parliament approved the expansion of the bailout fund on tuesday			0
@entity2 -- september 27 easily the least surprising ' yes ' vote on this list , @entity2 officially ratified @entity13 expansion yesterday -- a vital step towards the bankrupt nation receiving a second bailout worth over 100 billion euros out of the bailout fund in the coming months and years			2
@entity141 -- september 27 just weeks after opposition parties blocked the government 's attempt to fast - track the @entity13 bill , lawmakers approved @entity13 enhancements that are expected to be officially ratified on september 30			2
@entity148 -- september 22 another of the obvious ' yes ' votes on the list , @entity148 -- which received an 85 billion euro bailout last year -- was never going to object to @entity13 expansion			0
@entity154 -- september 15 ratification of the expansion of @entity13 powers was included in @entity154 's passage of highly contentious austerity measures aimed at balancing @entity6 's third largest economy by 2013			0
@entity161 -- september 15 @entity161 , known along with @entity154 as the two at - risk eurozone countries that are " too big to bail out , " passed @entity13 expansion several weeks ago			0
@entity164 -- september 15 as expected , @entity164 approved @entity13 enhancement , but prime minister @entity166 reportedly ruled out any proposed increases to the amount of money at the fund 's disposal			1
@entity172 -- september 14 the @entity172 parliament approved the @entity13 expansion by a large majority			0
@entity175 -- september 8 @entity6 's second largest economy was the first country to approve @entity13 enhancement			1
@entity175 banks are among the most exposed to risk due to a potential @entity2 default .			0

@entity96 's approval of @entity13 expansion is seen as necessary for the fund 's success
once opposed to @entity13 enhancement , the @entity65 are expected to approve in early october
members of @entity79 's coalition government *steadfastly* refuse to approve @entity13 expansion
