-- @entity1 , also known as " booms , " is " @entity3 " in @entity4 , located near the @entity5 in @entity6			1
the region is centered in the @entity8 , an area of ocean and land set apart in 1999 to protect its rich biodiversity of birds , reptiles , plants , trees and marine life			1
but now , the @entity6 government is preparing to sell the @entity5 to the @entity19 to build a megafreighter seaport and industrial park			1
@entity19 is part of a conglomerate blacklisted by the @entity24 under its fraud and @entity26			2
" they 're destroying what should be preserved , " says @entity27 , who has been working to protect exceedingly rare reptiles in the area for seven years , including the critically endangered @entity6 iguana			1
the specifics of the development are being withheld , but @entity35 reports it involves dredging and land reclamation , and a coal - fired power plant built to service the facilities			2
environmentalists expect the mangrove forest on the two @entity5 to be clear cut and the surrounding coral reef dredged			1
with the threat to @entity5 looming , @entity44 , a fellow with the @entity45 , flew to @entity6 to record images of wildlife and people who may soon see the destruction of their beaches , mangrove forest ecosystems and their livelihoods			1
in a short film by @entity44 , @entity27 talks about what 's at stake : " @entity8 consists of a beautiful beach and things that are here in @entity6 and found nowhere else , like the iguanas ... " when the mangroves are destroyed , the earth wo n't stay together and then the water will take over			1
and that 's the problem			2
and we wo n't have any beaches , and we ca n't do without beaches			0
if we have no beaches , we have no turtles			0
we wo n't have any crocodiles ... " booms especially fears for the @entity6 iguanas , @entity74 , thought to be extinct until 1990 , when @entity75 found one while hunting pigs in the @entity77			1
@entity78 are right off the @entity4 coast			0
at the time , surveys of the area revealed fewer than 100 iguanas remaining			2
@entity83 and @entity84 in @entity85 , teamed with the @entity86 in @entity87 and others , set up a program to rear baby iguanas until they 're big enough to be safe from predators			0
after release , the iguanas are tracked and observed to see how well they fare			0
the number of nesting females has grown from just six in 1991 to more than 30 in 2013			0
about 255 head - started iguanas have been released into @entity4 , the only place on earth -- other than the @entity5 -- that they can survive			0
the @entity101 believes the islands are the sanctuary necessary to save the animal			0
during the past 24 years , millions of dollars , plus the sweat of countless biologists and research volunteers , have been invested in bringing @entity74 back from the brink			0
although many released iguanas are breeding and nesting in the wild , the animal is still critically endangered			1
@entity6 iguanas can live for 40 years or more			1
they distinguish between strangers and researchers who come to the forest regularly and may show themselves once they feel safe			0
imagine a 4 - foot long , 15 - pound dinosaur - like animal walking out of the bush , sitting down nearby , and making eye contact with you			0
" there is indeed something special about making eye contact with a @entity125 , " herpetologist @entity121 , of the @entity86 , said			0
" back in the 1990s , you rarely saw an iguana ; you might hear one crashing through the bush but glimpses were a special sight			2
now , you go out in @entity4 and see big healthy iguanas that are habituated and come and hang out with you			0
it 's the most incredible story i have ever been a part of			0
" the @entity6 @entity135 states that the nation 's citizens have " the right to enjoy a healthy and productive environment free from the threat of injury or damage from environmental abuse and degradation of the ecological heritage			1
" some argue the project will bring jobs , but as fisherwoman @entity149 told @entity44 : " the government claims it will bring jobs and opportunity to the area , but we are not qualified , and we are not being trained for the jobs that will need to be done			2
they tell us what they want us to hear , but the reality is that we will be worse off			0
" @entity159 , ceo of the @entity160 , says that in past projects with @entity165 contractors , most of the employees have been @entity165			1
" what is the benefit to @entity6 ? that 's not clear			1
" @entity159 says developing @entity5 extends the global crisis of unsustainable exploitation of natural resources			0
" @entity6 is a small island , " she says , " but this is happening all over the world , relentless pressure for high impact development that does n't benefit local populations , particularly those who use the resources			1
" although global climate change is a clear danger to island nations , we are still building on the coast and taking out natural protections like mangroves			1
our regulatory agencies simply can not cope , especially with players like @entity165 who have huge financial resources and care little about the environment			1
" the rediscovery of the @entity6 iguana and the success of the recovery program has generated a huge conservation movement that draws international funding and ecotourism to the @entity197			1
this ecotourism could be developed			2
in 2012 , tourism contributed close to $ 4 billion to the economy of @entity6 and 25 % of jobs in the country are tourism - based			1
tourists travel to see unspoiled beaches and native flora and fauna , and ideally , to see people living in a healthy relationship with their land			2
but if the @entity6 government sells out to @entity165 developers , reversing its environmental protection laws and going against its own constitution , it will send the message that investing in tourism in @entity6 is unwise			1
there is still time to help the @entity6 people save their national treasure			2
both @entity6 and @entity165 care about international opinion			1
letters expressing concern and signatures on a petition may persuade prime minister @entity225 to stop the proposed development			2
of his work as guardian of the reptiles , @entity27 says , " my family and friends ? some of them think it 's awesome			0
... some of them ask me if i really touch the lizards and some think i 'm crazy when they hear about the crocodiles			0
but the truth of the matter is that they do n't understand , and i know that			0
' cause if they were here like me , they would understand			0
we are at one with nature			0

@entity165 plans huge industrial seaport in protected region of ocean and land in @entity6
@entity253 : @entity255 mangroves may be clear cut and coral reefs dredged
@entity259 : area is home to critically endangered @entity6 iguana and many rare species
she says @entity6 should stop the deal , invest in ecotourism , keep its *vow* to protect region
