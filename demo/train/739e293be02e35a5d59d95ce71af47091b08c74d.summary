-- if you 've ever been fired , you know the desire to get even with your boss			2
so when @entity6 was fired from his position as head chef for @entity9 , a restaurant in the @entity11 , he had a special opportunity			1
he tweeted : " calling all chefs			2
is there some sort of forum for naming and shaming bad employers ? " someone responded : " i just like to use twitter " to which he responded " well i better get on the case ; ) " the chef created the @entity25 account for his now former restaurant ( with its permission , he says ) back in october , but it appears his former bosses never got around to revoking his access to it			1
so he still had control of the public face for his former employer , and he definitely had something to say			0
the headline for @entity9 's @entity25 page now reads " let this be a lesson to all bad catering employers ... " and @entity6 's view of events got the light of day : " we 'd like to inform you that we 've just fired our head chef , " he wrote on the restaurant 's official page			1
" unfortunately he wanted to have a weekend off this month and @entity50 this year for family commitments so we thought we 'd sack him ... yeah a week before @entity50 ! we do n't care that he has a 7 1/2 month old baby daughter			1
" nearly a full day after the tweets were posted , they 've been retweeted thousands of times , and they continue to live on the website			2
calls and e-mails to the restaurant from @entity0 have not yet been answered			0
but the restaurant 's landlord has responded to the tweets , the @entity61 reported monday			1
" when @entity6 , as head chef , informed me that he would not be working on christmas day , and other sundays in the near future , i was left with little choice but to end our arrangement , " it quoted @entity66 as saying			0
" i had been quite clear with him when he started here in october that sundays are our busiest days of the week , and that all our chefs have to work that day			0
" the chef has taken to his personal page to explain his actions a bit more			0
" i stand by my comments whole heartedly , " he said less than 10 days before @entity50 , @entity6 is now unemployed , but his representative says he 's been offered a new job elsewhere since his actions got noticed			1
she says the restaurant has not contacted him since the firing			0
