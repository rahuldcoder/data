-- high levels of illegal immigration and crimes committed by unauthorized immigrants are among the key rationales cited by some supporters of a tough new immigration law in @entity8			1
" border violence and crime due to illegal immigration are critically important issues to the people of our state , " @entity8 gov. @entity9 said at the signing of the controversial bill , @entity11			1
" there is no higher priority than protecting the citizens of @entity8			2
we can not sacrifice our safety to the murderous greed of the drug cartels			0
we can not stand idly by as drop houses , kidnappings and violence compromise our quality of life			0
" yet , a look at statistics from the @entity33 agency and the @entity34 indicate that both the number of illegal crossers and violent crime in general have actually decreased in the past several years			1
according to @entity34 statistics , violent crimes reported in @entity8 dropped by nearly 1,500 reported incidents between 2005 and 2008			1
reported property crimes also fell , from about 287,000 reported incidents to 279,000 in the same period			1
these decreases are accentuated by the fact that @entity8 's population grew by 600,000 between 2005 and 2008			1
according to the nonpartisan @entity48 , proponents of the bill " overlook two salient points : crime rates have already been falling in @entity8 for years despite the presence of unauthorized immigrants , and a century 's worth of research has demonstrated that immigrants are less likely to commit crimes or be behind bars than the native - born			1
" backers of the bill maintain that crime is a key reason for the necessity of the tough immigration law			0
@entity8 state sen. @entity65 this week told @entity0 's @entity66 that half the murders in @entity68 are committed by unauthorized immigrants and that the city is the second in the world in kidnappings			1
a @entity0 @entity73 found that the senator 's claim about the murders in @entity68 can not be proven , but he did have police statistics to back up his claims of the city 's high number of kidnappings , although its exact standing in the world is not clear			1
in @entity85 , which includes @entity68 , sheriff @entity84 has long been an advocate of tough measures against illegal immigration			2
his officers already check the immigration status of people they detain for other crimes , he said			2
" we 've been doing it for a long time , but this [ law ] gives us just a little more authority , " @entity84 told @entity0			2
one way that @entity84 says he measures his success is that he hears that immigrants who entered the country illegally are leaving his county			0
" it 's a good indicator , " he said			0
statewide illegal immigration trends are harder to gauge			1
one aspect of it is the number of apprehensions of unauthorized immigrants made by the @entity107			0
since a peak in 2000 of more than 600,000 illegal crossers apprehended , the number fell to 241,000 in 2009 , @entity109 public affairs officer @entity108 told @entity0			2
" we 've seen a steady decline , " he said			0
intelligence - driven operations have increased the effectiveness of the @entity118 's efforts , he added			0
meanwhile , the cartel violence that has gripped @entity120 for the most part has remained there , he said			0
human and drug smugglers are being " more aggressive because we 're being successful , " @entity108 said , " but we 've been lucky not to see that type of [ violence ] spill over here			0

@entity34 statistics : violent crimes reported declined by nearly 1,500 over four years
reported property crimes also fell , by about *8,000* , between 2005 and 2008
@entity0 @entity73 : kidnapping is up in @entity68 , but murderers ' status ca *n't* be proven
@entity8 immigration trends murky , *largely* due to declining border apprehensions
