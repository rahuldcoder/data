-- october 6 , 1981 , remains etched in the minds of @entity2 who witnessed the assassination of president @entity5 at the hands of four military officers during an annual parade celebrating the anniversary of @entity2 's 1973 war with @entity11			1
in 1979 , @entity5 signed the @entity13 peace treaty with @entity11 that won him the @entity14 and the fury of many arabs who accused him of betraying their cause			1
in a tribute to the former " hero of war and peace , " as the inscription on his grave reads , @entity2 @entity24 ran footage thursday of the assassination , depicting the moment @entity5 stood in the pavilion saluting his killers while they fired at him as @entity30 fighters screeched over the parade grounds as part of the festivities			1
@entity34 , the lead gunman , was captured and executed			0
@entity5 's bullet - riddled body was rushed to the @entity36 and the president was proclaimed dead at 2.40 p.m. due to " intense nervous shock and internal bleeding in the chest cavity			1
" @entity41 , a former member of parliament and the nephew of the slain president , recalls the details of that grim day			0
" the president thought the killers were part of the show when they approached the stands firing , so he stood saluting them , " @entity45 told @entity0			0
@entity45 claims his uncle refused to wear bulletproof vests and always confidently argued , " i am among my sons			0
" an investigation uncovered evidence that the killers had plotted the attack with @entity57 , a @entity59 offshoot that had failed ambitions of launching an @entity62 revolution in the mid- 1980s			0
@entity63 , the leader of @entity64 , was convicted of plotting the assassination and spent almost 30 years behind bars before his release in april , among hundreds of political prisoners detained during president @entity70 's regime			1
three decades later , in his first interview with a @entity74 television news organization since his release , @entity71 was unapologetic about being a part of the killing of @entity5			2
" our role was related to assisting but not decision - making , " @entity63 recalled in his interview with @entity0			0
" all that we did , our role , is that we had ammunition that we sent " to the assassins			0
" the idea was just to change and provide an alternative leader who could save @entity2 from a crisis of the political dead - end we lived in then , " @entity63 explained			2
" i intended complete change , not just the murder of @entity5			2
" he cheered the january 25 revolution that ousted @entity70 on february 11 and felt " jealous " that his own religious revolution did not succeed			2
he also claimed that @entity57 has renounced its military arm because there was " no need to fight the oppression of the former @entity70 regime			2
" the fall of regimes almost always comes with the unveiling of secret documents and conspiracy theories			0
@entity5 's assassination was recently revisited by his daughter , @entity106 , a month after @entity70 was toppled			1
she filed a case in march at the general prosecutor 's office claiming new evidence had emerged implicating @entity70 , who was @entity5 's vice president			1
" the lead gunman 's machine gun jammed and he reached in the vehicle for another gun , " said @entity41			0
he demands an explanation to how guns without their safety pins were smuggled in			0
" where was my uncle 's elite security all this time ? " " the answer ( to all of this ) is @entity70			2
he benefits the most from the killing , assisted by the @entity74 and the @entity11 , " @entity45 said			0
meanwhile , the peace with @entity11 that @entity5 worked relentlessly to achieve may be at the brink of collapse			1
anti-israeli sentiment in @entity2 in the past few months has been its most violent since the times of @entity5 , as highlighted by the pro-democracy protesters who breached the @entity11 embassy on september 9			1
the same protesters who brought down the @entity70 regime insist on ending the exports of gas to @entity11 and many call for the cancellation of the @entity136 after an incident on the @entity11 - @entity2 border left five @entity2 soldiers dead .			1
