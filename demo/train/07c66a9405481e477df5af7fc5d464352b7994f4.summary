-- the first step is always the hardest -- but the second is just as challenging			2
once the dust has settled , the well wishers have moved on and the interviews have ceased , there 's the realization that there is a world out there -- waiting to be confronted			2
" for 25 years , you 've lived a certain way and with distance , " @entity13 footballer @entity12 , who now plays for @entity14 , said in an interview for @entity0 's " @entity16 : journey of a @entity20 " documentary			1
" you 're afraid to tell people and be open with stuff and so it 's hard to just change			2
a lot of gay men and women who are n't out and do n't really accept that they 're gay , live with a bit of self - hate			1
" so i hate to be so blunt about it , but hating yourself is very damaging			2
" @entity12 ' escapism came through writing -- notably his blog , on which he announced his revelation -- and therapy			1
" to live for 25 years or for some people , 40 or 50 years , that does n't go away quickly , " said @entity12 , who has also written a book " coming out to play , " which is released later this year			1
" it takes a long time			2
it takes a lot of writing and a lot of friends to speak with and therapy			2
" it 's serious stuff and sometimes people forget			2
they 'll say ' oh , you 're out , everything 's probably great			2
" it 's like , ' well , you knew me before i came out and you thought i was happy , so you do n't know			2
' " it takes time but it 's definitely progress , and positive progress			2
" @entity12 was 25 when he broke the news that he was gay on his blog , having just left @entity62 second division club @entity60			1
it 's a piece of writing which still brings out fierce emotion in man who had decided that he would longer be able to reconcile his love of football with a yearning to be free			2
he promptly retired from football -- only to return in may after being offered a deal to play in the @entity13 with @entity14			1
having played football throughout his childhood and then at college , he nevertheless struggled emotionally in the fiercely masculine arena where words like " homo , " " fag " or " gay " were commonplace			1
" i always heard homophobic things in locker rooms , on soccer fields , you know , before training , after training , " said @entity12 , who was more or less convinced he was gay by the age of 13 or 14			1
" whether it was joking or whether it was malicious , i just heard so many different things that scarred me and made me think that there 's no chance i 'm ever going to come out -- ever -- to anyone			0
" so that 's probably why , again , i kept it in for so long			0
that 's why i did n't tell anyone until i was 25			0
" since he came out in february , @entity12 has spent time speaking with college students and fellow members of the lesbian , gay , bisexual , and transgender ( @entity105 ) community			1
his message , wherever he goes and whoever he speaks to , is simple			0
" i regret it , " @entity12 said after contemplating whether he should have sought advice on his quandary earlier			1
" i wish at a young age i 'd have spoken with someone -- someone who did n't know my family or was n't a friend or anything			0
" i wanted a mentor or a therapist , somebody i could speak to and share my thoughts with , because to live so long without telling anyone is just very harmful			1
" people ask me , ' well , what would you tell yourself as a young kid ? ' " well , i would n't change any of my experiences , because i am who i am and because of all of those things , and because of my struggles , " i would n't change that			0
but , to speak with someone would have been , that would have changed a lot for me			0
" @entity12 grew up as part of a devout @entity136 family in @entity137			1
he felt the pressure of his religion and allied to the prying eyes of his testosterone fueled soccer teammates , he kept himself to himself			0
" the biggest obstacle is fear			0
the fear of rejection from their teammates , from fans , probably their families , fear of the owners of the team might not want a gay athlete			1
" i think people want to support themselves and they support themselves with their sport , so they if they lose their sport then how are they supposed to take care of themselves and all the other people they take care of ? " so , i mean fear is the number one factor			0
it 's just people ... there 's just so many things that play into that			0
" @entity168 , who won 52 caps for @entity170 and played in @entity62 , @entity171 and @entity170 , is the most high - profile former player to announce he is gay			1
like @entity12 , the former @entity170 international struggled with the concept of coming out while playing professional football			1
" there is a difference between silence and lying , " said @entity168			1
" i 've never been ashamed of being gay ... but i have asked myself the typical questions that gay people ask themselves : what would my friends say ? how will my family react ? but i 've never been ashamed			1
" @entity12 is now one of the most recognizable faces in the fight against homophobia			1
where in the past he would deliver crosses for a striker , now he delivers speeches on equality			0
where before he may have penned the odd autograph , he now signs thousands and writes articles for highbrow publications on @entity199 's homosexuality laws			0
he has received letters from those who are contemplating suicide , living a life of solitude , gripped by a fear which they can not seem to shake off			0
if @entity12 is all too aware of that fear , he has been buoyed by the sight of a younger generation who are embracing their sexuality			1
" i went to an event in @entity213 to speak with a bunch of kids at @entity216 and i saw about 500 kids , " he recalled			0
" they shared their story and i just talked about mine and answered questions			0
and , they were asking questions like , ' alright , we 're going to go home tomorrow , what should we do ? ' " these are all the kids that are @entity105 leaders of their groups in high school and i was like , ' oh , gosh , these kids are so brave			1
they 're all out in high school , some of them are freshmen and they 're just trying to change the world and just trying to be happy			1
' " it made me really mad at the people that could n't understand that and accept them , but also mad at myself where , ' ok , i have this proper platform where i can really try to help people with it			0
" kind of a global platform , and any of these kids would die or that , to have a platform in any way			0
' " @entity245 is also keen to promote the issue of gay rights -- particularly ahead of the @entity248 at @entity249 , @entity199			1
@entity199 law bars the public discussion of gay rights and relationships anywhere children might hear it -- and has been condemned by rights groups both at home and abroad as discriminatory			1
" i 'm coming out about my homosexuality because i want to move the discussion about homosexuality among professional sportspeople forwards , " @entity245 told @entity259 newspaper , @entity258			0
it is hoped that the @entity265 in @entity249 , where protestors have been afforded designated areas to air their views , will help fight the prejudice which is still so prevalent within sport and society			0
" i just hope that people will just forget any of those labels and stereotypes that are slapped on different people , " said @entity12			1
" whether it 's race , sex or sexual orientation , i just want that to go away			0
" i know that probably wo n't happen in the near future , but hopefully in the near future , if athletes decide they want to come out , they 're not pressured anymore			0
" it took me so long , i do n't want to be a hypocrite that way , but it would be nice if some could come out and start to move things forward			0
" and , until there 's same - sex marriage in every state , we 're still going to have to talk about that			2
" there are lots of issues which people get annoyed by because it does n't affect them , but we 're going to continue to talk about it until it 's over with			0
