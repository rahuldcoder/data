-- two years ago next week , @entity1 barreled through parts of the @entity3 , causing $ 65 billion worth of damage to communities up and down the eastern seaboard			0
@entity1 , which brought extensive flooding to @entity9 and @entity10 , was described by many as a once in a generation storm			0
but in the coming years , thanks to global warming , it wo n't take superstorms like @entity1 to bring regular and potentially dangerous flooding to parts of the @entity3			2
tidal flooding used to be a relatively rare occurrence along the @entity20 and the @entity21 , generally happening only occasionally at high tide or king tide , when the sun and the moon are aligned			1
but based on what scientists already know about climate change , it is clear that sea levels are going to rise over the next few decades			1
coastal flooding is expected to occur even more often and cause more disruption			0
this will redefine how and where coastal residents live , work , and go about their daily routines			0
high tides are having a greater impact now for two reasons			0
first , our coasts are more heavily developed , so higher tides affect more people and infrastructure			0
second , these tides are now occurring along with elevated -- and rising -- sea levels			1
global sea levels rose approximately 8 inches from 1880 to 2009 as global warming hastened land - based ice melt , and seawater expanded as it absorbed heat from a warming atmosphere			1
sea level rise worldwide is now accelerating , and at an especially fast rate along parts of the @entity20			1
this reality is captured in a report we co-authored earlier this month , analyzing how often flooding occurs at 52 sites along the eastern seaboard and the @entity21 and estimating the frequency and extent of flooding over the next 15 and 30 years			0
we found that many @entity20 communities now experience dozens of tidal floods every year			1
in some places , there has been a fourfold increase in the number of days per year with tidal flooding since 1970			1
when tidal floods occur , water can cover roads for hours , making passage risky or even impossible , trapping residents in their homes			1
sometimes this is just a short - lived nuisance , requiring traffic detours			0
but sometimes floods can compromise evacuation routes -- a particular problem when public safety and commerce in some coastal communities , such as those that dot the @entity87 in @entity88 , depend on just one or two access routes			2
so what can we do ? in the short term , municipalities , counties and states have to clear flooded coastal roads and repair damage from erosion and overwash			0
but over the long term , " in many cases , they are going to have to raise the roads on their existing path , " according to @entity105 at the @entity106 in @entity107			0
" money is a big question			0
" retail stores , restaurants and public infrastructure clustered in low - lying waterfront areas are also threatened by tidal flooding			2
@entity115 has been particularly hard - hit			0
tidal flooding " has really affected our business , " noted @entity116 , owner of the @entity117 © on @entity118 in @entity119 and one of the many people we spoke with when compiling our report			2
" we are down 15 percent on revenue during flooding , and in the past year construction [ to address flooding ] mixed with the flooding and has made our revenue loss worse			2
" using a midrange estimate for future sea level rise , we found that more than half of the 52 communities we analyzed can expect to average more than two dozen tidal floods per year by 2030			1
the rise in the frequency of tidal flooding represents an extremely steep increase for some , and two - thirds could experience at least three times more high - tide floods every year			1
we expect the @entity144 coast to see some of the biggest increases in flood frequency			2
because many communities are already coping with tidal floods , a tripling in their frequency would mean they could occur more than four times a month by 2030			1
@entity154 , @entity155 , and @entity156 , for example , can expect to average more than 150 tidal floods a year , and several @entity159 locations could suffer 80 tidal floods or more annually			1
by 2045 , many coastal communities likely will experience a sea level rise of about a foot			1
as that occurs , a third of the 52 locations in our analysis would begin to average more than 180 tidal floods a year			1
and nine locations , including @entity10 and @entity171 in @entity159 , can expect tidal floods 240 times or more per year			1
without sensible preparation , daily life in low - lying areas along the @entity20 and @entity21 coasts will become at best risky and at worst dangerous			2
coastal communities -- and state and federal agencies -- have to start planning today to cope with unprecedented tidal flooding and take precautions to limit longer - term damage			0
communities need to flood - proof homes , neighborhoods and sewer and stormwater infrastructure and limit new development in flood - prone areas			0
@entity192 and state governments , meanwhile , need to monitor sea level rise and flooding , provide funding and other resources for local resilience - building efforts , reform flood insurance programs , and -- most importantly -- address the root of the problem			0
sadly , the reality is that the near - term increase in sea level and tidal flooding may be unavoidable			2
but if states and the federal governments take concerted action to dramatically reduce carbon emissions , then we can at least avoid the worst consequences of global warming .			0

global sea levels rose about 8 inches from 1880 to 2009 , says science group
@entity216 , @entity217 : it *'s* accelerating along @entity20
by 2045 , nine locations can expect tidal floods 240 times or more per year , they write
