@entity0 , @entity1 -- the news that @entity4 and @entity5 are breaking up after 40 years of marriage has generated an outpouring of emotion			1
although we do n't have -- and should n't seek -- the inside details , the couple says the decision was mutual and the process will be mutually supportive			0
friends have told journalists that no third party was involved ; the two simply grew apart			0
it leads couples to wonder : " could this happen to us ? " and " could it already be happening to us ? " one woman called in to a radio show i was on and said plaintively , " i thought i could count on my marriage after 22 years			1
you mean we have to keep working at this for the rest of our lives ? " as a family researcher , i understand why the @entity5 breakup scares people			1
divorces after 40 years are rare , but in 2008 , of people who reported divorcing recently , one - quarter had been in marriages that had lasted two decades or more			1
and divorces among couples 55 or older seem to be rising moderately , even as divorce rates in general have fallen from a high of about 23 divorces per 1,000 married couples in 1979 to less than 17 per 1000 in 2005			1
many people assume that late - life divorces are precipitated by some crisis , typically a man leaving his wife for another woman			1
but a 2004 @entity49 survey of people who divorced at older ages found that two - thirds were initiated by the woman , often to the surprise of the man			1
although men are more likely to instigate a divorce when they have another partner in sight , women are more likely to say they just could n't stand to be with this partner any more , which jibes with the research showing that women are physiologically and emotionally more sensitive to the negative effects of an unsatisfying relationship			1
the rise in divorce rates for older people , which is occurring in @entity71 , @entity72 and @entity73 , as well as the @entity74 , results from the confluence of two new trends			1
the first is that we expect more from marriage than in the past			0
it 's no longer enough for the other partner to be a good provider or a good housekeeper			0
we want marriage to include friendship , sexual satisfaction and an interesting give - and - take between equals			1
the second is that if a marriage ceases to meet their needs , older people have many more alternatives than they used to			2
today individuals remain active and healthy much longer than in the past , so that staying together " until death do us part " means that 65 - year - olds in an unhappy marriage will likely have another 20 years to wait it out , when they could be traveling , working , even re-inventing themselves			2
and opportunities for repartnering after age 55 are much greater than they used to be			1
are late - life divorces a tragedy ? sometimes , perhaps -- but three - fourths of the divorced individuals in the @entity49 survey felt their divorce had been the right step for them			1
and having to stay in an empty marriage can be a tragedy , too			0
for a new book on the women of " @entity115 , " i interviewed women who were wives and mothers in the 1940s , 1950s , and early 1960s			2
many described being " trapped " in empty marriages , longing " to be free			0
" but in those decades they simply could n't imagine being able to support themselves , much less make new friends as a " divorcee , " or meet a potential partner			0
one woman told me , " we thought : you 're fat at 40 and finished by 50			0
" it 's scary to think that one 's own marriage could become so unbearably confining			0
it would be nice if every couple could grow together instead of growing apart			2
but it should be reassuring to know that if your marriage does become deeply unsatisfying , you have other ways to live the rest of your life , and you can end your marriage civilly instead of through humiliating public misconduct or explosive mutual recrimination			2
the @entity141 raised four children and were there for each other when they needed to be			1
now that they have decided to part , they are trying to do so in a way that is fair and respectful			0
that does n't sound like failure to me			0
for the rest of us , the @entity5 breakup is a reminder that we ca n't take our marriages for granted			2
but we should see that as a good thing rather than a scary one			0
people need to grow , and growing together can be fun			2
one of the best ways to renew marital affection and interest is to face new challenges together , whether that means learning new skills , braving a white - water rafting trip , or traveling to a new place			0
let 's take this as a lesson to stop working so hard in our marriages and spend more time playing in them			0

@entity173 says news of the @entity141 ' breakup makes older couples fret : could that be us ?
*contrary* to assumptions , late - life divorces usually instigated by women , she says
these divorces rare , but climbing , she says ; chance for repartnering greater these days
@entity173 : older couples should focus on growing together with *shared* experience , play
