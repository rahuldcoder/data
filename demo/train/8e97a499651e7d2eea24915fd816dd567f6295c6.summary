-- house speaker @entity1 and the president @entity2 continue to play chicken			1
@entity1 has indicated that unless the president sits down and negotiates some spending cuts or changes in the @entity8 , there will be no budget or debt ceiling increase			1
president @entity2 refuses to negotiate until after a " clean " budget is passed by the @entity12 and there is an unconditional debt ceiling increase			1
@entity1 complains that the president is willing to negotiate with @entity16 without any preconditions , why not the @entity18 ? the president responds by saying as a matter of principle he will not allow the @entity18 to hold as hostage the @entity24 economy by using the budget and debt ceiling as leverage in negotiations			1
the president emphasizes that he is willing to negotiate , but first @entity30 must enact a budget and debt ceiling increase			1
@entity1 responds by claiming that this is the same as offering to negotiate a cease - fire with @entity35 only after they first surrender and lay down their arms			1
this is a costly and dangerous game			1
each day there is no national budget many services are not available , parks and monuments remain closed , and thousands of federal employees are on furlough			2
a failure to raise the debt ceiling is much more serious			2
if the @entity50 defaults on its debt risks , catastrophic effects on our economy would follow : it would jeopardize the government 's ability to borrow on favorable terms and would lead to higher interest rates ; it would disrupt international credit markets and might well plunge the @entity24 into another recession			0
in my last book " bargaining with the @entity59 : when to negotiate , when to fight , " i address the question : when you are locked in the hardest sorts of conflicts -- those with an adversary whom you do n't trust , who has hurt you in the past and may hurt you in the future , whom you may even think is evil -- how do you decide whether to negotiate ? some in my field claim you should always choose to negotiate			0
after all , you can only make peace with your enemies			0
without sitting down and discussing things , how will you ever figure out whether there might be a solution that better serves your own interests than fighting it out ? others , pointing to the faustian legend , argue that you should never negotiate with the devil			2
to do so risks soiling your soul and giving up what is most important to you			0
i reject both categorical claims			0
the challenge is to make a wise decision in a particular context by carefully weighing the costs and benefits of alternative courses of action			0
here , wisdom requires the president to negotiate , but to do so without sacrificing his most important interests			1
if the president persists in his refusal even to explore with @entity1 what deals might be possible , @entity1 may be the first to blink			2
that would be a clear victory for the president and a clear loss for the @entity18			0
but what if the speaker , no doubt fearful he will lose his job as speaker if he blinks , refuses to relent ? when our national economy falls over the proverbial cliff , the @entity18 may be blamed more			0
but the president 's legacy will be seriously damaged as well			0
both @entity1 and the president should try to reach a deal that has face - saving elements for both , one that is not a clear loss for either			1
better still would be a deal that might allow both to claim victory and be good for the country to boot			0
such a deal is possible			0
it would involve two critical elements			0
the @entity12 and @entity127 should pass a " clean " budget bill and a " clean " debt extension -- i.e. , ones that do not themselves have provisions jeopardizing the @entity8 or federal entitlements			1
as this legislation is being enacted , the president and speaker should jointly announce in a press conference the creation of a bipartisan commission that within six months will submit to both houses for an up or down vote a combination of tax and entitlement reforms that over the next eight years will address the long - term deficit problems			1
in other words the two elements should occur simultaneously			0
this arrangement would allow both @entity1 and the president to declare victory			2
how can this happen ? the discussions leading to the deal must be kept private			0
both leaders have constituents who would object to it , and who would claim their leader sold out for too little			0
many democrats oppose any entitlement reform			1
no doubt tea party @entity35 will claim that @entity1 would be giving up the leverage of the debt ceiling without any specific spending cuts being enacted			1
making sure that @entity12 majority leader @entity162 supports the deal is important ; @entity1 wants to keep his job			1
with @entity162 's support , @entity1 can be confident that he will remain speaker			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity169 .			2

@entity169 : @entity1 , @entity2 in dangerous game of chicken over debt *celing* .
to end it , @entity2 should negotiate , but not sacrifice his most important interests , he says
he says a deal must save face . how ? @entity30 must pass " clean " budget and debt bills
@entity169 : at same time both should announce commission to take on entitlement reform
