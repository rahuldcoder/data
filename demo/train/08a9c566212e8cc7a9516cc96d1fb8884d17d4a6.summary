-- thanks to @entity2 , nearly 6 million currently uninsured @entity3 in the @entity4 will have access to affordable health care come january 1 , 2014 , including mental health and substance - abuse services			1
but some experts say that wo n't be enough to encourage mentally ill in the @entity11 community to seek help			1
in 2011 , 15.9 % of @entity11 adults reported suffering from a mental illness the previous year , according to the @entity15 on @entity16 and @entity17			1
but thousands in this population often go without professional mental health treatment			1
perhaps the most problematic issue for the @entity23 community is their fear of being highly stigmatized for accessing mental health services , experts say			1
among @entity23 with a mental disorder , fewer than 1 in 11 contact a mental health specialist , while fewer than 1 in 5 contact a general health care provider , according to the @entity31 's @entity30			1
even fewer @entity11 immigrants seek out these services			2
stigma haunts mentally ill @entity3 if a mental health issue is even acknowledged , @entity3 tend to rely on their extended , family , community , traditional healers and / or churches for help during a health crisis , according to the @entity31			1
as a result , @entity23 often mistake depression for nervousness , tiredness or a physical ailment , and see the issue as temporary			2
there are also a lack of culturally relevant services that cater to this population			2
" what makes it worse is having very few @entity23 leaders in the mental health workforce , " said @entity52 , former executive director of the @entity53			1
less than 25 % of mental health professionals are minorities , according to the @entity60			1
" most are n't bilingual and management has n't enforced culturally relevant strategies			0
" @entity52 knows from personal experience how trying the mental health care system can be for @entity3			1
after witnessing a friend being fatally shot following an altercation with a police officer in his @entity69 hometown , @entity52 said he knew he would never be the same			0
but what he did n't expect was the severe depression that followed and -- what seemed worse -- being called " crazy " by his high school peers			0
" when i was 16 years old , i tried to commit suicide , " said @entity52 , now 44			0
" latinos always hear how they have to be self - reliant when they have problems or even turn to prayer			0
but if you have a chemical imbalance , prayer wo n't help you			0
" even though the teasing in high school was bad , one of his worst memories is translating for his parents at the psychiatric ward because they only knew @entity88			0
" i wish the hospital had translators or even someone who understood us culturally , " @entity52 said			0
eventually , @entity52 overcame his mental illness , got into college , majored in psychology and became a social worker			1
he 's since made it his mission to change @entity3 ' apprehensive perspective on mental health issues and better the health care system in hopes others wo n't have to go through what he did			1
" the situation for @entity23 in this country will only get worse unless the system changes , " @entity52 said			0
according to the @entity53 , hispanics are a high - risk group for depression , substance abuse and anxiety			0
about 1 in every 7 @entity3 has attempted suicide			2
@entity11 adults and youth are also dealing with unique stressors like immigration and acculturation , according to the @entity119 -- which the organization said is even more of a reason to provide services that cater to this population			2
" latinos are overrepresented in service industry and those took a big hit with the recession , " @entity52 said			0
" ' hard to make ends meet ' is definitely a different kind of stressor			0
" many older latinos find the strain of acculturation overwhelming			0
their traditional values and beliefs are often at odds with the new culture , or they may lack family support and face language barriers			2
hispanic youth have also been found to be at risk for higher levels of emotional distress because of the pressures to rapidly adopt the values of their new culture while they suffer from inequality , poverty and discrimination			0
according to the @entity119 , @entity11 youth suffer from many of the same emotional problems created by marginalization and discrimination , but without the secure identity and traditional values held by their parents			2
" while working at a clinic in @entity164 , i was seeing a @entity166 family who became increasingly concerned ( about their ) 21 - year - old son , " said @entity159 , dean of the school of social work at the @entity162			0
" they said he was having trouble with nervios ( nerves )			0
" the young man was eventually diagnosed with schizophrenia			0
" we were able to explain to the family the severity of the situation			0
it was a matter of helping them understand that their son 's schizophrenia was a mental illness of the brain -- not be critical , avoid pejorative judgment and assure them that they did n't fail as parents			1
" after several months , @entity159 said , the family refrained from using labels and changed their perspective on mental illness			1
he said part of the problem is how the mental health and primary care systems are separated , and how they are presented to @entity3			1
" i worked with undocumented immigrants who would ask for ' consejo ' ( advice ) knowing they were asking for mental health services , " @entity159 said			1
" we could reduce the stigma significantly			2
... it 's how we present it to them			0
it helps to have integrated mental health services into the primary care setting			1
we should ( be ) bringing the services to them rather than bringing the people to the services			0
" in the last decade , the @entity23 population -- now at 53 million -- has grown by nearly 40 % , and is expected to make up close to one - third of the nation 's inhabitants by the year 2050			2
tackling the mental health disparity now could prevent serious future health issues , experts say			1
@entity2 will help fund new clinics and community centers in highly @entity11 - populated cities around the country , which would allow them to seek mental health care at little or no cost			1
" change wo n't happen overnight , but i think the key is educating the current population and , even more , motivating the @entity23 youth interested in the health sector , " @entity52 said			2
" after having gone through my own mental health issues , i can tell you that just knowing you are n't alone is so important , " @entity52 said			1
" most times we have our own answers , but if i had someone who understood where i came from it would have made an even bigger difference			0

@entity2 will give 6 million currently uninsured @entity3 access to mental health care
@entity3 are less likely than *non-hispanic* whites to seek out professional help
disparity could be linked to lack of @entity11 mental health professionals
stigma in @entity11 community around mental illness is also a problem , experts say
