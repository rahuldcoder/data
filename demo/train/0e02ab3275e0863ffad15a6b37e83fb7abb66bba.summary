-- is there no end to @entity4 's talents ? she is a grand slam tennis winner , but she has a prodigious intellect and is also an adept artist			1
in the relaxed settings of @entity11 's garden in @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity4 reflected on a career that blossomed after years of struggles -- both personal and professional -- opening up about feeling like a " ghost " as a child and her @entity19 win at @entity20			1
@entity11 's garden is one of @entity4 's favorite spots			1
she often traveled to tennis tournaments around the world with paint brushes and recently graduated from art school in @entity28 with a 90 %			1
the stellar grade should n't come as a surprise , since the @entity13 once claimed she had an iq of 175 , higher than @entity32			0
despite winning @entity20 and carving out a 13 - year professional career with earnings of more than $ 11 million , @entity4 suffered for her art on court			1
and contrary to what she uttered in august , @entity4 has no plans of staging a comeback			1
" i had some really deep scars that were wide open , " the 29 - year - old told @entity0 's @entity41			0
" but i covered them and made sure no one could see them when i was playing			0
" now i can say i have passed every single test , and i became the happiest person in the world			0
" feeling of neglect by now many know the methods her dad and coach , @entity54 , used to train @entity4			1
her father -- also a doctor -- would reward @entity4 with sweets when she hit targets and attached tennis balls to the bottom of her feet to make sure she stayed on her toes			1
using old tennis balls in practice allowed @entity4 to acclimatize to all types of bounces			1
but much lesser known is how @entity4 said she played second - fiddle to her older brother -- who was having " issues " at school -- when growing up and received less attention from her mom @entity71			1
" she was giving more time to him than to me and i had almost to be a ghost , " said @entity4			1
even as she rose into the top 10 and reached major finals , the feeling of neglect lingered			0
over the years @entity71 rarely attended @entity4 's matches			1
" my mother had another , big influence in another way , " said @entity4			1
when asked if she had now proven herself to her mom , @entity4 added : " oh yeah , i think so			2
but that 's what was also very hard for me to take with my dad , when i could see his disappointment with my performance			0
" that was the toughest part			0
" in 2011 , @entity4 's fraught relationship with parents came to a head when she threw them both out of a player 's box on a @entity20 side court			1
but she grew stronger mentally on the tennis court , helping to explain her ascent			2
her game mirrored @entity100 ' in being unorthodox -- hitting with two hands on both the forehand and backhand			0
between points @entity4 could often be seen bobbing up and down , concurrently simulating a swing			2
" the way she bounced up and down and swung between points was exhausting , " retired former world no. 5 @entity106 , a longtime analyst with @entity107 , told @entity0			0
" she must have run so many miles between points let alone during the points			0
" for a spell @entity4 never bounced the ball before serving , another unusual practice			2
for the casual fan @entity4 rose to prominence at @entity20 in 2007 when she upset then world no. 1 @entity114 to reach the finale			1
her fondness for actor @entity117 , who watched one of her matches , became international news			0
" personal " problems @entity122 was indeed @entity4 's most productive surface , with her flat , hard ground strokes moving through the court and making life difficult for her opponents			1
this , despite her home grand slam being held on clay			0
it took a while for @entity4 to win over @entity13 fans and she was in dispute for most of her career with her federation			1
when it did n't budge in her request to make @entity54 a key member of the @entity142 setup , she sat out the competition and missed last year 's @entity144 -- on the very same grass at @entity20			1
but @entity4 would be the last woman standing at the @entity146 last july			2
not that she expected it			0
" if i tell you what was happening three days in my life before @entity20 started , you will never believe i won it , " she said			1
" keeping busy " @entity4 contested a @entity20 warmup in @entity153 on the east coast of @entity155 and developed a 40 - degree fever that forced her to pull out of a second - round encounter against former @entity159 champion @entity158			1
she had " personal " problems , too , to contend with -- reportedly the separation of her parents			0
" i just prayed to @entity163 and said , ' the only thing i want from now on is to be happy			0
i do n't care about my tennis ranking , i do n't care about winning or losing			2
i just want to be happy , ' " she said			0
i was tired , lonely and sad			0
" @entity4 's friends rallied around her -- " when i feel loved , i can lift mountains , " she says -- and thus her special fortnight began			2
@entity4 will be the first to tell you the draw gods helped , as she did n't have to face ex champions @entity173 and @entity174 , or grand slam winner @entity175			1
as it turned out , @entity4 avoided any player in the top 10			2
but @entity4 downed the promising @entity181 in the quarterfinals , former @entity20 junior titlist @entity183 in the semifinals and big - serving @entity185 in the final			1
even though she was better ranked than @entity185 , many picked the @entity188 to triumph given she had upset @entity173 and @entity189			0
@entity106 was n't one of them			0
" i thought she was just so beautifully focused and determined that there was no question in her mind that she was n't going to win , " said @entity106			2
" you could see the determination written large on her face			0
" @entity4 had little nerves entering the final , relaxed enough to take a nap shortly before it began , joking with her entourage and even booking tickets for her team			2
prior to striking an ace on the final point , @entity4 flashed back to those days as a child when she finished practice past midnight in freezing conditions under a leaking roof			2
when it was over a hug to dad , the biggest influence in her career , ensued			0
" two weeks earlier i just wanted to be happy , and then i won @entity20 , " said @entity4			1
then you can write , ' the end			0
' " it was indeed almost the end			0
a month later , her body unable to withstand the demands of the tennis tour any longer , @entity4 quit			1
" she dragged every little bit of talent out of herself , " said @entity106			0
but a return , a @entity224 , @entity225 or @entity226 , is n't on the cards			2
" i will not come back , " @entity4 insisted			2
even after winning @entity20 , @entity4 was subjected to comments about her appearance after @entity232 commentator @entity231 apologized to her for saying she was " never going to be a looker			1
" at the time , asked about @entity235 's comments , @entity4 reportedly said : " it does n't matter , honestly			1
i am not blonde , yes			0
have i dreamt about having a model contract ? no. i 'm sorry			0
" @entity4 , meet @entity240 @entity4 is keeping busy in retirement			2
she played in an exhibition on @entity243 -- owned by @entity244 -- this month and returns to the @entity245 in january to meet the fastest man on the planet , @entity240			0
@entity4 is n't sure what is on the agenda that day			1
" he actually invited me and wanted to meet me , " said @entity4			0
if @entity240 wants to learn more about tennis , painting -- and maybe even life -- @entity4 might just be the right person .			1
