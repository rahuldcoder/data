-- the big hardware unveil at monday 's @entity3 press event was the new @entity4 , a sleek cylindrical desktop computer and the most powerful machine @entity3 has ever built			1
it was the announcement that prompted @entity3 executive @entity7 to exclaim , " ca n't innovate anymore , my ass			1
" it also costs thousands of dollars and is way more machine than most people will ever need			2
the @entity4 is aimed at a narrow market of professionals such as photographers , videographers , designers and animators			1
since the line was first announced in 2006 , the @entity17 has received relatively few upgrades compared to the rest of @entity3 's product line			1
the company has been busy focusing on its hit consumer and mobile devices , leaving many professionals wondering if they were being left behind			0
for people using the desktop computers in their businesses , the external look of a @entity27 is often secondary			2
so periodic internal improvements to the old tower design were enough to keep them satiated			2
others had already abandoned the @entity35 as the @entity36 and @entity37 became powerful enough to meet their photo - and video - production needs			2
for the remaining power users , reaction to the new @entity4 is mixed			1
and the future of the computer , which is 2.5 times faster than the current model , is still unclear			2
@entity45 : @entity3 's ultimate @entity27 is bizarre and beautiful first things first : the new pro is a design marvel compared to its clunky predecessor -- a sleek , black cylinder that bears little resemblance to computers as we 've traditionally imagined them			1
it 's smaller and can not be expanded and customized as much as the previous system			2
@entity3 has built a machine so unique that people who want to add to it will end up building out , adding components like hard drives and pci cards externally			1
to make that expansion possible , the industry must first embrace the thunderbolt input - output standard			1
for example , it 's no longer possible to pop in standard video cards			0
@entity4 users will have to either get cards that fit the custom shape of the new computer or plug them into the computer using a thunderbolt 2 connection			1
" it 's either going to change the way computers are built , or it will fall by the wayside , " said @entity76 , the creative services director at the @entity78 production studio			0
@entity76 is excited about the new product and hopes to upgrade his studio 's systems , but he hopes @entity3 's " risky " bet to depend heavily on @entity87 for expansion pushes the companies that make hard drives , @entity92 cards and other peripherals to support the connection technology			1
but @entity95 of @entity96 , a @entity98 post-production studio , is less impressed			0
" basically , it 's two @entity100 tied together in a cylinder , " he said			0
" it 's a load of rubbish			0
the things that we need in the film and video business , everything 's dependent on cards			0
" @entity3 adding " kill switch " to @entity111 users of the new @entity4 may want to stray outside @entity3 's closed system			1
@entity95 , who has been shooting and editing film for 28 years , has seven @entity27 at his company			0
he is in the process of building a " hackintosh " -- a custom pc that uses the same cards and boards found in a @entity27 that can run @entity27 software , but has more usb slots and can take additional cards			0
these unofficial systems can cost as little as $ 1,500 to build			0
" we do n't want to switch to @entity118 because a lot of the software we use is @entity27 only , and we 've been @entity27 users for a long , long time , " said @entity95 , adding that all his backups and stored video are @entity27 compatible			0
launched in 2006 , the @entity4 is one of @entity3 's priciest products , starting at $ 2,499 for the most basic setup			1
many creatives who need to squeeze the maximum amount of power out of their machines get custom @entity4 configurations , which can go as high as $ 12,000 , not including monitors or accessories			1
a price has n't been announced for the new @entity27 pro. monday 's unveiling was just an early preview , and the computer wo n't be available until later this year			1
pro users are a small part of @entity3 's business			1
only 19 % of the company 's revenue in the first quarter of this year came from @entity27			0
that 's just shy of the 21 % it made selling @entity153 and a far cry from the 49 % it made on the @entity111			0
when @entity157 were struggling , it was creatives who gave the brand some of its respectability and a cool factor			0
for now , they are enjoying a rare bit of attention from @entity3 and hoping for the best			2
" we 're all glad that they came out with a pro tower at all , " @entity76 said			0
" i think we were all fearful that they would abandon the pro community			0
" @entity3 arrives ( late ? ) to music streaming			2

@entity3 previewed its new @entity4 desktop computer on monday
the new design is striking but offers fewer *options* for expansion
for creatives to switch to the machine , third - party companies must embrace @entity87
the @entity4 is one of @entity3 's priciest products , starting at $ 2,499 for the most basic setup
