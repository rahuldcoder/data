as accusations over @entity2 and @entity3 spying spiral into political controversies at home and abroad , there are two key questions bubbling beneath the surface : what did president @entity9 know , and when did he find out ? @entity3 officials have said that the president did n't know about problems with the website for the health care policy he championed and that it was n't until recently that he learned about a @entity19 operation that wiretapped @entity22 chancellor @entity21 's phone			1
@entity23 , the chairwoman of the @entity24 , became the latest official to say the president was unaware of at least some spying			1
" it is my understanding that president @entity9 was not aware chancellor @entity21 's communications were being collected since 2002			1
that is a big problem , " she said monday in a written statement			0
questions about what the president knew and when he knew it have important implications , analysts told @entity41 on monday			1
if @entity9 was aware , that could mean he is n't being clear with the @entity3 public now			1
and if he was n't aware , that could mean his own staff kept him in the dark			0
" there 's really no good answer , " said @entity48 strategist @entity47			1
" if he knew , essentially we 're being misled by different people in the administration about the extent of the president 's knowledge			2
if he did n't know , it 's an abdication of even the most basic responsibilities of the command and control over very important parts of his administration , and that becomes a problem			2
" @entity66 , associate editor of @entity67 , said this is n't the first time this sort of situation has come up , and someone aiming to protect @entity9 could have deliberately kept him out of the loop			1
" so he gets to sort of exonerate himself and say , ' i really do n't know			0
but if he 's not responsible , who is ? " she told @entity41 's the lead			2
" he has to be accountable for major decisions and major moments like this			1
when someone like @entity21 calls him , he has to be able to be accountable to her and say these are n't decisions made by other people			1
" @entity87 : do n't tie issues together in an exclusive interview with @entity41 last week , @entity90 secretary @entity89 said the president did n't know of problems with the @entity2 's website until after its glitch - laden launch on oct. 1			1
this was despite the fact that insurance companies had been complaining and the site crashed during a pre-launch test run			0
at a press briefing monday , @entity87 spokesman @entity102 declined to detail what @entity9 knew and when			2
he said that tying topics like problems with the @entity2 website and reports about @entity19 spying together is " conflating a bunch of very disparate issues			2
" asked about a @entity111 report that the @entity87 stopped the operation monitoring @entity21 after learning about it over the summer , @entity102 said he would n't " get into individual reports about specific programs " but said he 'd provide more details once a @entity87 review of @entity3 surveillance is complete			1
experts : not every detail disclosed it 's plausible that @entity9 would n't know about specific surveillance targets , said @entity41 national security analyst @entity123 , who sits on the @entity125 external advisory board			1
overall intelligence collection priorities are well - known by the @entity87 , she said			0
" specific targets , however , ( like ) @entity21 's cell phone , are not the sort of thing discussed with the @entity131 , " she said			0
every morning , @entity132 said , @entity9 receives an intelligence narrative			2
" it does n't tell him specifically where the collection came from , " @entity132 said , " but some of it is sort of self - evident			0
" no one should expect the president to know everything the @entity19 is doing , said @entity143 , a professor of history and public affairs at @entity146			0
" but when you 're talking about the surveillance of world leaders , and an issue that 's been controversial for a while now , you would expect that there 's some knowledge either by the president or people surrounding him			2
... i do think there 's surprise that this was off the radar in the inner circles of the @entity87 , " he said			2
time for change ? @entity161 @entity3 rep. @entity161 , a key member of the @entity162 , said if the surveillance happened without the president 's knowledge , it has larger implications			1
" i would say if the president did not know , that raises very serious questions about what he 's doing as chief executive			2
the fact he would be going into negotiations and discussions and meetings with @entity21 or @entity179 leaders -- or any leaders for that matter -- and not be aware that there was surveillance going on of the private phone calls , to me either something is definitely wrong in his administration or he just has a totally hands - off attitude			0
to me , this is unacceptable , " @entity161 told @entity41 's @entity189 on monday			2
no matter what @entity9 knew , or when , @entity66 said , it 's time for a new approach			1
" he has often said that he did n't know what was going on with the ( @entity195 ) website			1
... he ca n't pretend he does n't know and walk away from problems anymore , because he has been caught too many times out of the loop , " she said			0
" he ca n't do his job that way			0
" problems in management , analysts say @entity205 , who analyzed @entity9 's leadership style in his book " @entity208 , " said the recent glitches in @entity195 give a glimpse into problems with @entity9 's management approach			1
@entity9 should get high marks for the concepts of policies he 's pushed forward , like the @entity2 , @entity205 said			1
but he 's struggled with implementing them , @entity205 said			0
" whether @entity9 gave orders that were not followed , or simply did not give directives that were precise with attached ticking clocks , if you will , in terms of execution , he clearly should have , minutes after the @entity2 was passed , said , ' this is a logistically high bar to cross			0
let us begin now to come up with models , alphas and betas and test runs , and call in the best people on the planet to make sure that we have a system that is ready to operate efficiently on opening day			0
' " but when @entity9 learned of the problems is n't the most important question to ask , @entity205 said			1
" the question is , what will he do now ? " @entity234 , a @entity41 political commentator and a columnist for the @entity236 , wondered whether some officials would lose their jobs if the president really was n't informed			1
" the question becomes , why do the people who failed to keep him in the loop still have their jobs ? " he said on @entity240 360			0
another columnist at the @entity236 said it looks bad that @entity9 looks uncertain			0
" ( one of the ) basic kinds of rules of management is : never let the boss get caught off guard			0
the boss is caught off guard here			0
that is a problem , " @entity254 said			0
" that is a management problem , and they 're going to have to figure that management problem out			0

@entity24 chair says president should have been told of some spying
officials say @entity9 did n't know about @entity195 website glitches and @entity3 spy programs
analyst : " this has happened before . ... he has to be accountable for major decisions "
@entity48 strategist : " there 's really no good answer "
