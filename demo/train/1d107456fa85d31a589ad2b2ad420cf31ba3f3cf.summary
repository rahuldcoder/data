-- @entity2 's engagement ring just so happens to be a hand - me - down from the late princess @entity4			1
it 's a blue sapphire surrounded by diamonds set in white gold			2
although this family treasure is very dear to prince @entity11 's heart -- it was his mother 's engagement ring -- the superstitious may think that 28 - year - old @entity2 should never have accepted it			1
not because she does n't want to marry her @entity14 ( literally ) , but because some believe jewelry can be cursed			0
another big blue stone , the @entity18 , was not good luck for @entity21 royals			0
@entity22 and @entity23 were the last royals to enjoy the stone before it was stolen and they lost their heads			0
the @entity0 : 6 things prince @entity11 should n't repeat from parents ' wedding even if you do n't believe that jewelry can be cursed , i 've heard an old wives ' tale that claims engagement rings are supposed to carry the energy of the marriage from whence they came			1
meaning : it is bad luck to inherit a ring from an unhappy marriage			2
so , essentially , @entity2 is wearing the ring of a troubled princess who had a very bad marriage , not to mention a tragic end			1
if i were @entity2 , i might have hoped for something with a little bit less bad juju			1
and for the rest of us eyeing jewels for our big day , heed these other jewelry superstitions : the @entity0 : found out my engagement ring was piece of junk diamonds , not pearls , on your wedding day in medieval times , people believed that pearls were unlucky because they represent tears			1
diamonds , however , were considered great luck because they were thought to have the power to drive away witches and also prevent the wearer from ever going insane			0
hence , why wearing pearls instead of diamonds on your wedding day would be thought to predict an unhappy marriage			2
the @entity0 : 10 things to know about @entity2 do n't remove ring ; do n't put one on it is considered bad luck if a woman removes her engagement ring before the wedding for fear that the wedding may not actually happen			1
also , you are not supposed to let another woman try your ring on if you do n't want her to steal your man			2
conversely , it is considered bad luck for a single woman to wear a ring on her engagement finger as it might curse her to be single forever			1
stick to your own stone ? some people think that it 's bad luck to wear a birthstone that is n't yours			0
uh , are n't diamonds the official birthstone of the month of april ? does that mean every bride who does n't have an april birthday is cursed ? silver earrings keep bad spirits out wearing a pair of silver earrings was once thought to keep the devil away			0
silver earrings were used to prevent evil spirits from entering the body through any orifices			0
so think about all the devils you are keeping out of your body the next time you rock a simple pair of hoops			0
