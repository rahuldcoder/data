@entity0 -- @entity3 researchers examining the carcass of a large , pregnant @entity6 python said monday they found a record 87 eggs inside , giving them important clues about the reproductive capability of the dangerous , invasive species			1
scientists at the @entity12 on the university 's campus examined the 164.5 - pound , 17.5 - foot snake friday after it was brought there from the @entity16			1
it is the largest one ever found at the park			1
" this thing is monstrous -- it 's about a foot wide , " said @entity19 , the manager of the museum 's herpetology collection			0
" it means there 's nothing stopping them and the native wildlife are in trouble			0
" pythons wiping out mammals in @entity16 , researchers say @entity16 and the @entity32 are working with other agencies on the problem of the @entity6 python , a non-native but established species in @entity12 that is one of the deadliest and most competitive predators in the southern part of the state , according to the university			1
the snakes have no known predator , and population estimates range from the thousands to hundreds of thousands			1
previous records for @entity6 pythons captured in the wild were 16.8 feet long and 85 eggs			1
scientists say research of the snake 's biology is important in understanding how to stop the python 's spread -- not just in the @entity56 , but also in the state and around the world			1
" i think one of the important facts about this animal is its reproductive capability , " said park wildlife biologist @entity59			0
" there are not many records of how many eggs a large female snake carries in the wild			0
this shows they 're a really reproductive animal , which aids in their invasiveness			0
" 16 - foot python devours deer in @entity12 the snake was so big that researchers had to pile it on top of itself and wheel it into the examination room on a flat cart			2
they laid it on a series of tables lined up end to end , and then five researchers worked side by side to dissect the length of the snake			0
the @entity6 python is native to @entity96 and was first found in the @entity56 in 1979 , the university says			1
they were determined to be an established species in 2000			2
" they were here 25 years ago , but in very low numbers and it was difficult to find one because of their cryptic behavior , " @entity19 said			0
" now , you can go out to the @entity56 nearly any day of the week and find a @entity6 python			2
we 've found 14 in a single day			2
" there are state laws now that prohibit people from owning @entity6 pythons as pets or taking them across state lines without a federal permit			0
floridians can also hunt them during certain seasons if they have the proper license and permits			0
@entity12 has the world 's worst problem with invasive reptiles and amphibians , the university said			2
in a study published last year in the journal @entity126 , @entity19 found 137 non-native species were introduced to @entity12 between 1863 and 2010 , with pet trade determined to be the no. 1 cause			1
readers ' solutions for @entity12 's wild python problems			0

the python is 17.5 feet long and *weighed* 164.5 pounds
it is the largest ever found in the @entity16
scientists are *hoping* for clues about how to stop the snakes ' spread
the species is dangerous and invasive , with no known predator
