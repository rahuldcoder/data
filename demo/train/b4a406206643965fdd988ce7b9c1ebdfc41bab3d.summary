-- @entity2 's international rugby career could be coming to a close after the former @entity5 hero was dropped by @entity6 for saturday 's @entity8 finale against title hopefuls @entity10			1
the fly - half was widely regarded as the planet 's best player after kicking @entity6 to glory at the 2003 @entity5 , but has been almost as largely vilified this year due to his team 's uninspiring performances			1
the 30 - year - old will be replaced by @entity19 in @entity20 , having been dropped for only the third time in his @entity6 career			1
@entity2 went off after a heavy blow to the head against @entity26 last weekend , when @entity19 made a big impression after coming on as a substitute to earn @entity6 a 15 - 15 draw			1
the result ended @entity6 's slim title hopes			2
@entity2 has been passed fit to take his place on the bench against the @entity34 , who have won all four games so far and would need to suffer a heavy defeat to allow @entity38 to retain the title			1
@entity6 coach @entity40 , the team 's captain in 2003 , said he was happy to give the 24 - year - old flood a starting chance			0
" @entity2 took a number of bangs and heavy blows			0
we need at least two players in every position and we would have been happy to pick @entity19 in every game so far , " he told the @entity48 @entity47			0
@entity2 's career has been blighted by injuries since 2003 , and his failure to regain his form as @entity6 's influential playmaker in this year 's @entity8 tournament means he will struggle to feature at the next @entity5 in @entity59 in 2011			1
younger players such as @entity19 are likely to be given their chance to shine in the november internationals against @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 and @entity59			0
@entity40 has made six changes for saturday 's game , with captain @entity68 named in the squad despite being in doubt with a knee injury			0
winger @entity72 will make his debut in a backline that sees veteran @entity5 winner @entity75 recalled at center and @entity77 start at fullback , with @entity79 dropped from the squad			2
lock @entity81 returns from injury , while flanker @entity83 starts in place of @entity85			0
@entity10 welcome back center @entity86 , with @entity88 making way despite scoring two tries in last weekend 's win against @entity92			2
the @entity34 have not beaten @entity6 since the 2006 @entity8 , losing in the @entity5 semifinal in 2007 and then again in @entity20 the following year before another defeat at @entity95 12 months ago			1
@entity10 have not won the championship since 2007 , which was their second in a row			0
in saturday 's other matches , @entity100 host @entity92 and then @entity38 take on @entity26 in @entity101 before the @entity20 match starts .			0
