too often , it 's tempting to view sports through rose - tinted glasses			2
we believe that coaches always have the best interests of our young people at heart and that everything they do on the side of that court , field , pool or track is for the long - term , holistic benefit of young people			2
we even rationalize that coach - player interaction and athlete management behavior that makes us wince and avert our gaze somehow makes our children -- and even society -- stronger and our future elite athlete role models more humble and worthy			1
sadly , " it 's character - building " is the rallying cry for dysfunction and another damaged generation			1
even when we believe that a young person 's sports experience is on the wrong track , we convince ourselves it ca n't have that much of an impact			2
i wish that were true , but medieval coaches , like the recently fired @entity35 at @entity36 , are a detriment to society , not just sport			1
opinion : wrong move to fire bullying coach as a former basketball player at college and in the @entity45 , i know this coaching style firsthand			1
frankly , you ca n't print the way i was treated in some sporting environments			0
at a major @entity51 university , i had an assistant coach who would engineer drills to maximize the chance of fighting or conflict and who frequently called his players " p * * sy " and " queer			1
" in the pros , players were humiliated every day with the crude epithets of sports , demeaned , belittled and challenged physically by coaches without the ability to actually take up their challenge			1
it was demoralizing , but at least we were well compensated for being treated like dirt			0
what saved me is that i did n't start playing sports until i was 17 , so i was spared much of the trauma of what i see happening to kids today			2
i 'm not soft , and i 'm certainly not politically correct			0
indeed , i make sure that membership in my sports and community center in the @entity78 is challenging : physically demanding and psychologically testing but emotionally warm			0
a place where high value is placed on building and nurturing positive relationships while still expecting the very highest standards in sport , study and life from our participants			0
watch : @entity88 on coaches who bully i saw the video of @entity35 's coaching " techniques " and felt momentarily vindicated -- before waves of nausea born of watching the repeated verbal , physical , emotional and psychological abuse overwhelmed that momentary hubris			1
i take a lot of stick , mostly from men and from around the world , who think that @entity35 's behavior might be a bit extreme but that coaching is somehow not beholden to the usual educational norms			1
in classrooms and other educational settings , this behavior would never be tolerated and indeed would mean expulsion from an entire profession , not just from a job			2
we have allowed a parallel universe to develop where sports coaching is concerned			2
we do n't generally tolerate granting underqualified but well - meaning teachers unfettered access to vulnerable people			1
but in sports , someone giving up some time for free and winning some games -- while being entirely unqualified to be around young people -- is vaunted			0
i watch amateur sports most weeks and always ask parents who see coaches screaming and spitting , shouting and grabbing their children whether they would tolerate that as " character - building " if it were a @entity129 or math teacher doing the same thing			1
invariably , their faces change , and you see the immediate outrage			0
the truth is , they would never countenance that treatment if it happened in the classroom			0
without the shield of sports gear and sweat , the damage to their children becomes clear			0
i am aware that in the @entity51 and @entity144 , coaches are usually volunteers , and volunteers are well - meaning			0
but i will say very strongly that i do n't care			0
being well - meaning and full of good will is not sufficient			0
abusive coaches are the products of emotionally illiterate and physically and psychologically violent , coercive and under - informed coaching environments			1
although many family and educational factors can mold a man like @entity35 , you can be certain his experience in youth sports has played a major role in honing his understanding of acceptable behavior in sports as an adult			1
radically improving coaching 's tone and style and respecting an athlete 's psychological welfare are so important because bad coaching can unleash monsters on society , each generation meting out abuse learned at the hands of the one before			1
men like @entity36 ' @entity35 are not rare , they are simply rarely caught on tape , rarely exposed and rarely challenged			1
a recent @entity78 study ( @entity175 ) suggests that 75 % of young people experience psychologically harmful treatment in sport			0
this is the gravity of our collective responsibility and the burden of the role of coach			2
as coaches and educators , we participate in the creation of indelible memories for young people			0
coaches can not afford to be just good at winning			0
the violence and unpredictability of authoritarian and aggressive coaching infects all those it touches			2
think of the number of young men who have experienced @entity35 's wrath over his career			1
that kind of poison infects and potentially manifests in all but the most resilient of them			0
coaches need to stop bullying and start mentoring , educating and inspiring young people			1
it 's for the benefit of our young people now but also for them , and others , when they grow up and gain power of their own .			0

@entity36 coach @entity35 fired after video shows him *kicking* and bullying players
@entity88 says this behavior is not rare , it is part of a damaging coaching *culture*
we would never let @entity129 or math teachers abuse vulnerable kids this way , he says
@entity88 : abusive coaching is *perpetuated* from generation to generation and needs to stop
