-- it was just after midday on a cold december monday in @entity3 's capital when news of @entity6 's death filtered through			1
though the reclusive @entity9 leader had been plagued with health problems in recent years , the announcement was greeted with general astonishment in @entity12 , according to a journalist from the country 's largest newspaper			1
" the initial reaction was shock , quickly followed by speculation about what was going to happen next , " said @entity16 , assistant editor with @entity17			1
for its part , the @entity3 military responded by raising its alert level , while the country 's media went into overdrive trying to predict how this oblique and erratic state would respond			1
but @entity16 said most ordinary @entity9 were remaining calm			1
@entity9 : should we fear change ? " there was no rush to supermarkets to buy up food , " he said in an interview with @entity0			0
" the @entity3 public seems confident that the country will be able to manage this			2
many see the @entity9 as like us , people we need to care for and help			0
" outright conflict is not something many would expect , he added			0
" there is a little tradition in @entity3 that when someone passes away in a family you stop fighting			2
" we 're on high alert not because we want to do something but because some renegade @entity9 unit might cause some trouble			0
but no one really thinks the @entity9 will launch an attack			0
" nothing happened in 1994 when @entity58 died and it will be the same this time			1
" the architect of what became known as the @entity9 in 1948 after the @entity61 was divided between @entity63 and @entity64 occupation forces , @entity58 was an autocratic leader who presided over a policy of @entity66 , or self - reliance , which did much to foster the @entity70 country 's isolation			1
when @entity6 , his oldest son , succeeded him , @entity9 was crippled economically , having lost one of its main trading partners when the @entity64 collapsed			2
@entity6 largely ignored the massive problems at home and focused on shoring up the regime 's position and investing in the military as a bulwark against the wealthy , @entity63 - backed south			1
what military hardware does @entity9 have ? but with @entity6 dead , @entity16 believes many in the south will see this as an opportunity to improve relations with their dysfunctional neighbor , perhaps even paving the way for reunification			1
" most people , whether left or right on the political spectrum , hope this is the case , " he said			0
" however a large chunk of @entity3 do worry about the financial burden of reunification , citing the case of @entity97 and @entity98 in the early 1990s			2
" others argue the cost of living together will be a lot less than living separately in the long run			0
i also believe a whole host of issues could be resolved with reunification			0
" but @entity16 said each generation in @entity3 has its own viewpoint when it comes to relations with the north			1
" those in their teens and 20s have a real fear of military conflict , as they are the ones who have to complete their compulsory military service , " he said			0
" many people in their 30s and 40s worry about the financial cost to them of reunification , while those in their 50s and 60s back a united @entity3 whatever the cost			1
" if reunification is a pipe dream for now , @entity16 says there is a difference of opinion in @entity3 about the dynastic succession in the north			1
" many people believe the transfer of power to a third generation is absurd , totally anachronistic and not what the world is about today , " he said			0
" but those who believe in a policy of engagement with @entity9 say it does n't matter whether it is third or fourth generation , they 're still our people and we need to talk to them to try and resolve the situation			2
" another view , according to @entity16 , is " the @entity150 " will not last long			2
" he 's simply too young , " he said			0
@entity150 is believed to be in his late 20s			0
" there is this notion in @entity9 society -- north and south -- that if you take the throne too young you wo n't last long			0
no matter how good he is , they think his uncles and more experienced family members will rule from behind him and that he could ultimately be sacrificed			0
" as pictures of ordinary @entity9 mourning the loss of their @entity6 continued to filter onto television screens across @entity3 tuesday , @entity16 felt most people would have been struck by how staged they seemed			1
" the pictures do n't reflect the reality in @entity9 , " he argued			0
" when @entity58 died there were a number of people who really went out and cried because they really did respect him			1
" @entity6 's case is different because about two or three million people died of starvation after he came to power			1
the level of mourning will be about a tenth of what it was in 1994			2
this is the view of many defectors i have spoken to			0
