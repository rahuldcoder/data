@entity0 -- one of the first questions many people ask when they start a new job is : what type of car will i get ? however , @entity8 -- known to opt for public transport in his home town of @entity11 -- refused the car that had been prepared for him after his election on wednesday			2
instead of traveling from the @entity13 to the @entity15 residence in a car carrying the license plate @entity17 ( @entity19 1 ) , he jumped on the bus alongside the other cardinals			0
if the demands of the pontificate prove too exacting for @entity25 bus schedules , however , he is unlikely to be disappointed by the vehicles on offer			1
for when @entity28 sang " lord wo n't you buy me a @entity31 " she probably did n't realise that the man @entity34 consider to be @entity36 's representative on @entity37 had already had his request granted many times			1
the pope did n't actually travel in a car for state visits until 1930 when @entity43 became the first ever recipient of a @entity31 state car			1
the @entity46 was custom - built with silk carpets and a dove motif embossed on the roof lining			2
the pope clearly liked the idea of becoming motorized as he apparently took it for an hour - long test drive around the @entity25 gardens			1
since then he 's had a string of @entity31 including a @entity56 in 1960 , a 600 @entity57 in 1965 and a @entity58 in the 1970s			1
but although the pope uses @entity31 on home turf , his transport is n't restricted solely to the @entity64 car maker 's products			1
when the @entity8 goes to different countries his hosts submit the details of his proposed transport			1
if these meet the @entity25 's strict security criteria they 're given the go - ahead			1
if it does n't the @entity25 supplies its own vehicle			1
the pope has n't always been motorized on state visits			2
until 1978 , his primary mode of transport for meeting his public was the sedia gestatoria , a glorified sedan chair carried on the shoulders of various papal attendants			2
obviously this had certain limitations , both in how far and how fast he could travel			0
it fell out of favor when the reign of pope @entity88 ended in 1978			2
the early days of motorized papal transport were far removed from the @entity31 vehicles he currently drives			1
when @entity93 made his first visit to his home country of @entity96 in 1979 he was transported on a lightly modified @entity96 @entity98 flat - bed truck			1
then in 1980 @entity31 was commissioned to build a bespoke model			1
it chose the @entity100 and a model christened the @entity102 was readied in time for the pope to use for his first trip to @entity64			2
the bulletproof glass came following the assassination attempt on @entity93 in 1981			0
but in 1982 , on his visit to @entity109 he was back in an open vehicle , a specially converted version of the popular @entity112			1
this open - air vehicle had a simple grab handle so the pope could stand up and wave to his followers			1
equally rudimentary was the @entity118 truck supplied for the pope 's 1982 visit to the @entity121			1
such was the determination of the @entity121 authorities not to lose a @entity8 on their watch this armored beast was the heaviest popemobile ever at 24 tons			0
since 2007 , @entity128 has primarily used either a @entity129 or smaller @entity130			2
but these are n't off - the - shelf @entity132			2
in @entity133 the @entity129 features a fold - down windscreen along with the pope 's traditional @entity136 paint			1
in less secure situations , the pope has another modified @entity140			1
this has the more familiar plexiglass dome which protects the pontiff from adverse weather while ensuring he remains visible to his flock			0
at 8mm thick , the glass is also bulletproof			0
but being encased in glass presents its own problems , principally overheating , so a powerful air - conditioning system was quickly added			2
this prevents the pope getting uncomfortably hot when the sun is shining but also ensures the glass does n't steam up in high humidity			2
spotlights have also been installed in the sides , floor and roof compartment so direct and indirect illumination makes his holiness more visible when darkness falls			0
@entity162 too has reached new levels			0
the glass has been made bomb proof so it can withstand explosions , the side panels are armored for the same reason and the underneath of the vehicle is blast - proof			1
should the worst happen and the pope come under attack , his compartment has its own oxygen supply			0
the pope enters his compartment through a door in the back			0
he then sits in a bespoke chair made from white leather with gold trim			0
this employs a system of hydraulic lifts that raise him up so he can be seen more easily			0
it also means that most people wo n't be able to see the two papal aides who occupy two chairs in front of the pope 's			1
the front seats of the @entity102 are occupied by a security guard and obviously , the driver			0
although it 's had a lot of extra weight built into it , the engine has been uprated			0
it means this particular @entity140 can hit 160mph even if it only spends most of its life doing a much more sedate 6mph			0
all this capability does n't come cheap though : it 's estimated the current @entity102 costs about $ 565,000			0
the high cost presents a challenge to host nations , especially impoverished ones			0
for his 1995 visit to the @entity209 , local car maker @entity206 produced a popemobile based on a 4x4			0
as it had to be built with bomb and bulletproof parts the local faithful contributed to the extra cost			0
when @entity93 died in 2005 , this popemobile was put on display in a @entity209 church and became a pilgrimage destination for the country 's @entity34 who could n't afford to go to the @entity25 for the burial ceremony			1
it 's probably the only time a car built in the @entity209 has ever been worshipped .			0

popes have used a string of @entity31 vehicles since 1930
when popes visit different countries , hosts submit details of proposed transport
if it 's secure enough , it gets go - ahead . otherwise , @entity25 supplies own vehicle
since 2007 pope uses bullet - proof , bomb - proof @entity31 capable of 160mph
