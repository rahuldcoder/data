@entity0 -- the @entity2 is @entity4 restaurant is unlikely to end up in many international guidebooks as a must - visit destination in @entity0			1
sitting on the outskirts of the @entity10 capital city , the eatery chose its moniker after the famous @entity13 song of the same name and is themed around @entity10 's @entity15 ( 1966 - 76 ) , an era which many would rather forget			1
and yet on any given night of the week , the restaurant gathers a large and boisterous crowd			2
waiters race around dressed as red guards , the student army force of the time			2
revolutionary posters decorate the walls and red flags deck the tables			2
the central draw is a stage , where entertainers sing " red " revolutionary songs and perform mock struggle sessions			2
people in the audience cheer and sing along ; some even cry			2
the @entity2 is @entity4 is just one of many venues in @entity0 that gives the @entity15 a makeover , repackaging what was once a tragedy into a gimmick			1
some have been kicking around since the late 1990s , while others are more recent additions			0
" it was really exciting , " commented 26 - year - old @entity41 of his recent trip to one			0
" everything was new to me			0
i knew a bit about that part of history from my parents but i do n't feel a connection to it			0
" it seems strange to use this period of @entity10 history as entertainment			1
after all , the @entity15 , which was @entity56 's political campaign aimed at rekindling revolutionary zeal , saw violence spread throughout the country			1
by its end an estimated 36 million had been persecuted , with at least 750,000 of those killed in the countryside alone			0
countless historical relics were destroyed , and universities closed , depriving many young people of years of education			0
though the @entity15 has been largely erased from official discourse on the @entity70 , its horrors relegated to an appendage in history books			1
those who did not live through the @entity15 know it was a difficult time , but few grasp the extent			1
this historical amnesia might explain why some young @entity10 in particular can enjoy the venues			1
" @entity10 's historical memory is very barren , so even recent events can fall through a gap , " said @entity78 , a longtime @entity10 watcher who visited one of these venues as part of field research for a book he wrote on the death of @entity56 , whose passing away marked the end of the @entity15			1
" if you detach it from the political context it is just fun , like a @entity94 - themed bar in @entity95 , " @entity78 added			0
but @entity78 also sees more to the trend			0
although people are critical of the @entity15 , the era is n't only remembered for its destruction			1
" while a lot saw the time as horrific , enough people had a good experience and associate the period with a sense of freedom and youth , " @entity78 said			0
this is especially the case for those who came of age during the era , such as @entity113			0
@entity113 was born in 1957 and has lived in @entity0 her whole life			1
during the @entity15 she enjoyed traveling around the country for free , and divided her time between school and youth parades			1
for her , these venues provide an avenue for nostalgia			2
" when i went to the restaurant they called me ' comrade ' , the common greeting of the time			0
it felt intimate , " @entity113 said , adding that the singing made her happy because the ballads belong to her generation			0
however , not all look at the @entity15 through red tinted spectacles			1
@entity132 , who co-wrote @entity133 ( 2011 ) , is one of them			0
for @entity132 , the book was written not to capitalize on the trend to consume positive aspects of the @entity15 , but rather to educate the masses about all aspects , good and bad			1
" even though the @entity15 is very recent history , people do n't know much about it			1
this is especially the case in the @entity143 , where they can romanticize it , " @entity132 said			0
@entity132 was part of the sent - down youth movement at the time , which saw thousands of children taken away from their parents and sent to work in the countryside			0
writing the book was " a cathartic experience -- a way to go back to a recent , difficult period , " she said			0
" the @entity15 was terrible , one of the worst human experiences anyone can have			1
" @entity132 admits the irony of writing a cookbook about a period that had little food			0
but even though it was a time of austerity , her generation learned how to cherish food and create delicious , healthy dishes			0
in this respect @entity132 shares something in common with another group of people who visit these venues in @entity0			1
they are those who hark back to a time , real or imagined , that they deem better than contemporary @entity10			1
@entity15 food might be tainted by unpleasant memories , but at least it was not tainted by pesticides			2
and for some , especially the @entity178 generation , they feel ambivalence not just towards current food , but also current politics			0
" the @entity15 is essentially a religious experience , an ideological break from the @entity10 of now			1
they associate the government today with materialism and believe the government stance that the @entity15 was bad is just propaganda , " said @entity78 of this group , who are labeled neo-maoists			2
among the most notorious of @entity0 's neo-maoists is @entity190 , who was born in 1976 and currently manages the @entity193 bookstore , a shop that specializes in books praising the late @entity10 leader and his policies , and criticizing reform era capitalism			1
earlier this year , @entity199 got into trouble due to his support of @entity203 's revival of " red culture " in @entity205			0
@entity203 's policies involved the employment of nostalgic @entity13 propaganda and a harsh crackdown on businessmen accused of corruption			2
they gained him notoriety , as well as enemies , who attacked them as throwbacks to the @entity15			2
in the days immediately following @entity203 's removal from his post as head of @entity205 and party secretary on march 15 , @entity199 was paid an unfriendly visit by the authorities			0
the popular website attached to his bookstore has since been suspended			0
@entity1 was unable to reach fan to ask his thoughts on the @entity15 , but in an interview with @entity10 site @entity231 back in april , fan is quoted as saying , " ... some traitors in the party betrayed communism and created all sorts of rumors to attack chairman @entity56			1
" despite these recent events , the atmosphere at @entity193 remains upbeat , as does the atmosphere at other venues that market the @entity15 in @entity0			1
perhaps they simplify and trivialize the era			0
however , they still bring people closer to an otherwise rarely mentioned period of recent @entity10 history , and in so doing , shed light on @entity10 today .			2

some venues in @entity0 *celebrate* the @entity15
@entity15 has been largely erased from official discourse on @entity10
some decry the @entity15 , while others are nostalgic about it
