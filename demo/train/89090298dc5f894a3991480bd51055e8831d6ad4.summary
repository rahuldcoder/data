-- @entity2 's ' ghost stations ' are a paradise for urban explorers , daredevils who compete for the most spectacular photos of their visits to the abandoned labyrinths that stretch under the capital			1
but the party may be over , as @entity2 seeks to transform its abandoned tube stations into a powerhouse of urban development , and address the problem of expansion in one of the most expensive cities in the world			1
ex-banker @entity20 , 41 , is leading a campaign to push the ghost stations into service			0
the founder of the @entity25 has plans to develop 26 sites with an estimated value of £ 3.6 billion			1
he envisages leasing and converting them into retail parks , entertainment centers , offices and cultural experiences			0
" you can operate 24 hours a day underground , " says @entity34			1
" @entity36 could come and go at any time without worrying about the noise			0
" " then there is the unique selling point that almost no one has seen these places before , which will guarantee a lot of interest			0
" five years after beginning the planning process , the entrepreneur believes his vision is on the verge of reality			0
a single site -- down street station - has undergone extensive assessments for logistics and safety , and @entity34 claims that @entity54 ( @entity54 ) have assured him it will be converted and opened to the public in 2015			1
development would make use of the city 's cultural capital			2
previously a @entity62 bomb shelter , @entity63 also accommodated wartime prime minister @entity65 's private apartments , @entity34 intends to make the site a tourist attraction based on its history and according to his figures , it would return a profit within three years			0
the entrepreneur believes this would be a breakthrough to herald mass - scale development			1
" the value is the model , " he says			0
" there are billions in these properties that need to go to market			0
we are launching a new sector			0
" @entity34 has corralled an international team of investors , and construction company @entity84 -- which built @entity2 's @entity85 -- is ready to convert the space			1
he claims there is enough interest to launch all 26 sites whenever permission was granted			2
@entity54 would not confirm any deal , but said that assessments are ongoing and did not rule out a single site opening commercially next year			0
a spokesperson stressed that mass development would be limited as many stations are still in " operational use " -- including as emergency exits			2
the network has already made some tentative steps , using part of @entity103 to host an underground farm			2
the @entity105 has sold one its underground site - @entity107 road - to @entity109 investors			1
mayor of london @entity110 has called the development of ghost stations a " brilliant plan " and pledged to support it if it does not require the investment of public money			2
should the plans go ahead , it would see @entity2 take a lead in a global race to develop cities underground			1
in recent years , @entity123 has sought to address its overcrowding with a 300 - meter deep ' @entity125 ' to accommodate retail , housing and cultural attractions			1
@entity130 's ' @entity129 ' is an audacious attempt to create the world 's first underground park , slated for a 2018 opening powered by innovative solar technology that would support the growth of plants deep below the surface			2
@entity140 capital @entity139 has taken the concept furthest , getting around its space limitations with strategic ' @entity143 '			1
features include leisure centers and shopping malls , along with much of the infrastructure , such as roads and data centers			0
with over 80 % of the world 's population projected to live in cities by the end of the century , subterranean development has become a critical facet of efforts to sustain growth			2
in a 2013 report , the @entity158 suggested that " facilities underground may be the most successful way to encourage or support the redirection of urban development into sustainable patterns			1
" " it 's absolutely a growth area , " says @entity165 , editor of the new civil engineer			0
" all the businesses we talk to anticipate growth in construction of ever deeper underground spaces			0
in @entity2 a growing number of properties are three or four stories deep			1
with so little space there has to be new ways to make use of it			0
" @entity182 says that technology has played a role , with the development of self - supporting concrete , and 3d computational modeling that allows architects to plan at ever - greater depths with minimized risk			1
" there has been development of skill in underground tunneling that gives confidence to clients now , that projects will be built on time and budget , " says @entity165			1
@entity165 adds that energy costs could be significantly lowered through the warmer atmosphere underground , another inducement for potential occupants			0
for the future of business , the only way is down .			0

underground sites worth £ 3.6 billion to be converted in @entity2
would facilitate 24 - hour operation and solve space issues in urban hubs
@entity140 , @entity214 , @entity123 join global movement to underground development
