-- when it comes to deciding where the money goes , the @entity2 team says its main priority is the car -- not the star driver who sits in the cockpit			1
@entity10 said last week that he decided to leave it and rejoin @entity12 for the 2014 season because @entity2 " have n't got my salary			1
" but the team , owned by @entity17 - based investment group @entity16 , has now responded by explaining that it prefers to focus its finances on developing the car , even if it means seeing their driving talent walk away			1
@entity10 has posted @entity2 ' only victory this year , with himself and the team both fourth in the respective driver and constructor standings			1
" our suppliers and key people who develop the car were our priority -- maybe not @entity10 , " @entity2 team principal @entity27 told the official @entity29 website			1
" @entity10 was in a similar position last year and it was all settled by the end of the year			1
and @entity38 had the plan to do the same this year			0
" it is public knowledge by now that we 've been late in paying him , and he got upset			0
" to manage the cash flow -- and i do n't mean the money itself or the budget we have , which is guaranteed by @entity38 , or at least most of it as we do n't have the revenue stream to allow us to live independently from @entity38 -- this cash flow is an issue if you have fixed costs and want to keep up the development level			0
" you have to decide where you want to spend your money			0
" @entity16 took full control of the team -- which has raced in @entity29 since 1981 under its previous guises @entity63 , @entity64 and @entity65 -- from previous owner @entity65 in 2011			1
ownership by a private investment company , instead of car manufacturers such as @entity70 and @entity71 , which owns @entity12 , or a global company such as @entity73 , can provide a more risky financial backdrop for an @entity29 team			1
but @entity27 says that @entity2 ' alternative business model does not mean it is mired in a financial crisis , as the rumors circulating in the sport would suggest			2
" @entity73 or @entity70 , those companies are sponsoring the teams , " said @entity27 , whose driver management company gravity also has connections to @entity38			2
" @entity38 has a different strategy : they loan the money			0
" it is part of the strategy that partners join the team and @entity38 will get back their investment			2
" seventy - five percent of the debt @entity2 has comes from @entity38			2
they could write it off tomorrow by saying this money is a sponsorship -- and then our debt would be drastically reduced			0
our normal debt is similar to most of the other teams			0
" @entity38 's strategy of choosing to bankroll the team before looking for sponsorship deals to recoup their investment is a gamble			2
having 2007 world champion @entity10 on board would have inevitably helped attract sponsors , but now @entity27 is looking at alternatives			0
he says the team plans to emulate the business strategy of some of rivals , including @entity73 and @entity113 , by looking for a title sponsor			1
" it is no secret that for quite a while @entity38 have been looking for partners to make sure that we can bring more money to the team and have access to a bigger sponsor portfolio , " the @entity115 added			2
" we need to secure sponsors , as this is the only way to step up			0
" @entity2 depends massively on the people -- and to attract the best people to a team you need to have money , to be able to build something for the long term			1
" @entity38 's plan was to bring the team up within five years -- which we are trying to do -- but to move to the next step you need another five - year plan in place			0
and that is what we are working on			0

the @entity2 team says it prioritizes spending on developing the car
driver @entity10 is leaving @entity2 at the end of 2013 because he was not paid
@entity2 is financed by investment company @entity16 , which loans the team the money
the team is looking for a *lucrative* title sponsor for the 2014 season
