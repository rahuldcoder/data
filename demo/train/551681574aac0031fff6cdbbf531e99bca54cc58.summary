-- @entity1 is n't the leading man actor normally described as dashing and ruggedly handsome when he enters the room			1
sure , the movie star charm and warmth is there , but when @entity1 sits down with a group of reporters , it 's as a father who knows terror			1
after being introduced to @entity13 audiences in 2000 with " @entity14 , " @entity1 has carved out a career in films portraying an intense , if disheveled , man of thought and action in " @entity21 , " " closer " and " @entity22			1
" he 's also shown the ability to be a little less thoughtful with fun , ultraviolent flicks " @entity26 " and " @entity27			2
" in the new psychologically driven horror - thriller " intruders , " which opened march 30 , @entity1 plays @entity30 , father to a 13 - year - old daughter terrorized by the tormenting being " @entity33 , " who wishes to possess her and might be connected to a family secret			1
meanwhile , in another country , a young boy is experiencing the same phenomenon			0
as the children 's stories begin to take shape and come together , the @entity33 mystery is unraveled , as is @entity30 's family unit			1
along with the online sexual predator film " trust " -- and to some degree the single - parent drama " @entity46 " -- " intruders " seems to mark a new chapter of @entity1 's career playing fathers who often feel powerless			1
@entity1 sat down with @entity0 to discuss his portrayal as a father and his own real - life experience as one			1
he also talks about what terrified him as a child and as an adult , and the power of secrets in families			2
@entity0 : why do audiences respond to seeing children terrified ? @entity1 : because we remember being terrified , probably			1
... bad dreams and nightmares , when you 're very young , are very intense experiences			2
i remember it , and i 've seen it in my own children			0
i think , over time , you learn to process it , and you wake up very quickly and can figure out what 's real and what is n't real			2
but for a child , it can really throw you off center			2
@entity0 : how important do you think family secrets are ? @entity1 : i think that we all have them			1
i think that 's the truth			2
i think that this is a very personal film to @entity87 and happened to him when he was young and related to secrets that his family had and that 's why he wanted to explore them in this film			2
@entity0 : do you think it 's important to keep them or is it detrimental ? @entity1 : i think you have to take each one at a time			1
i think sometimes it is maybe better to get things out in the open			0
@entity0 : what scared you as a kid ? what scares you now ? @entity1 : i was n't that sort of a fearful kid , really			1
i remember having nightmares , but i never had recurring nightmares or got scared at night			0
i was n't that kind of child			2
when people say to me , what scares me now , it 's without doubt , the sort of welfare and well - being of my children , really			1
i think that 's the one thing that you kind of do n't have much control over -- just fearful that they 're going to be ok and they 're going to be alright			2
@entity0 : as opposed to roles where your body has taken a beating , does this kind of psychological role beat up your mind at all when the threat is from within ? @entity1 : that 's a good question because it 's harder work than you think			1
you 've got to take the audience to quite an intense place and sometimes doing that is as hard as doing a page of dialogue			2
because if you fall short , the thing does n't work			0
you have to get to get to a level of intensity			0
that 's why i thought @entity145 [ @entity144 , who plays @entity1 's daughter @entity146 in " intruders " ] was so good in the movie -- because she , in some ways , really holds that together			1
it 's her emotional terror that we 're kind of gripped by as the film goes on			2
@entity0 : can you talk a little bit about how your character growing up has unresolved issues with his mother that affected his parenting skills when he became an adult ? @entity1 : i think there 's absolutely no question the central theme is that passing on fears to your children is a very real and truthful thing			1
... i 've got a friend ... and the mother is scared of dogs , and the kids are now terrified of dogs			0
... that 's a very simplistic version , but i think that kids are very sensitive and alive to what 's going on within people and specifically , their parents			0
@entity0 : have you passed on any fears to your kids ? @entity1 : only good things ! @entity0 : when you 're dealing with a child actor like @entity145 in these very intense scenes , do you ever have to step aside with her and just check in on her to see if she 's ok ? @entity1 : i think you have to do that before you even start working			1
i 've done about three films in the last few years that have very strong relationships with children and playing a parent , basically			0
it 's usually important that they feel safe before you begin , especially if you want to push it into areas that are uncomfortable , which is an interesting and good thing to do			1
but the child needs to feel safe and that everything 's ok			1
... i actually really love working with young actors because i think they are so responsive and instinctive			0
and it 's much less honed a craft they 're employing , but it 's very real and reactive			0
@entity0 : are you going to veer off from thrillers ? are you going to do more comedy now ? @entity1 : no. i am filming a comedy , which is very exciting actually			1
it 's the first one that i 'll do really			0
it really makes me laugh			0
so , i 'm excited about that but that 's not for a while , yet			0
i think i just instinctively respond to material and , at the end of the day , you look at it , and that kind of shapes a career			0
there 's no question that " trust , " " @entity46 , " and this film are obviously are related because i 'm a parent			1
i 'm a parent of two girls			0
there are things within that that i thought , ' this is really interesting to explore ' ... to do it in a very truthful way is something very exciting to discover			0
@entity0 : you 've said you 're a huge fan of " @entity231			0
" so why do you love it so much ? @entity1 : i think it 's a really well - directed movie			1
not just a horror movie , but a movie			0
i just thought it was extremely well - acted , and it still holds up today			1
my 12 - year - old daughter has heard about it and says , ' @entity241 , i want to watch " @entity231 "			0
' sweetheart , you 're not watching that for 10 years			0
do n't even think about it			0
i had it in the house and got rid of it because i 'm paranoid that she was going to think , ' i 'll just have a little look , ' and get traumatized for the next four years .			0
