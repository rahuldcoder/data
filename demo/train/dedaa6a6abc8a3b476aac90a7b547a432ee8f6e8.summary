the scene is like something from a horror movie			0
saturday , a known supporter of the @entity5 and @entity6 posted a video online of one of two @entity10 hostages holding up what looks like a picture of his beheaded compatriot			1
the video follows one released earlier in the week featuring a militant threatening to kill the two @entity10 citizens if a $ 200 million ransom was n't paid within 72 hours			1
they are the kind of images many @entity10 hoped they would not have to deal with			1
after all , @entity10 is currently barred by its " peace constitution " from engaging in offensive military action			1
yet despite this , @entity5 has apparently decided that @entity10 is an adversary			1
this is likely in part because @entity10 is a close ally of the @entity28 , one that also has a strong interest in the stability of the @entity32			2
moreover , during his recent visit to @entity35 , @entity36 and @entity37 , prime minister @entity33 pledged $ 200 million in non-military aid to nations dealing with @entity5			2
but whatever @entity5 's intentions , @entity10 's non-combat role in world affairs has n't stopped it from being a victim of terrorism in the post-september 11 era			1
in 2003 , for example , two diplomats were killed in a terrorist ambush in @entity49 , and several citizens were taken hostage in @entity49 in 2004 and 2005			2
in 2012 , a veteran journalist was killed in @entity6 , while in january 2013 , nine @entity10 citizens were killed in the @entity55 hostage crisis			1
still , this latest hostage crisis has been particularly attention - grabbing for many @entity10 for two reasons			1
the first and most obvious is the fact that there was such vivid notice given -- the huge ransom demand with a 72 - hour ultimatum -- followed by the disturbing images saturday			0
but the hostage - taking has also prompted an interesting debate over the story behind why journalist @entity68 and self - styled military contractor @entity69 were in @entity6			0
the @entity10 public obviously hoped for the safe return of our two citizens , but most did not believe the government should pay the ransom			2
and there was also particular sympathy for @entity68 , who is not only recognized for his journalism , but who was apparently captured after going to the region to try to rescue @entity82			0
but there have also been questions about why nothing was done sooner when the two had been missing for months , and also why they were in such a dangerous part of the world in the first place			0
many @entity10 believe the two bear some responsibility for traveling to the region despite public warnings by the @entity10 government about the risks of citizens traveling there			2
looking ahead , the hostage - taking has left many wondering what the impact will be on @entity10 's current efforts to upgrade its security policies and processes			1
the crisis will be seen as underscoring the impact of instability thousands of miles from its shores , and therefore the need for @entity10 to adopt a sharper , more proactive security posture even beyond @entity111			2
more specifically , one of the 15 scenarios presented by the @entity10 government in its push toward a more proactive defense posture was allowing the use of weapons in overseas rescue missions of @entity10 citizens			2
the development of this specific scenario reflects the lessons of the 2013 @entity55 crisis , and the fact that under current laws , only aircraft , vehicles , and vessels are allowed for transportation			0
if these changes are introduced , the @entity10 government would be able to dispatch its @entity131 for armed rescue operations ( upon approval from the country involved )			0
certainly , given the security challenges that @entity10 faces , both within @entity111 -- in the form of territorial issues with @entity140 and with an unpredictable @entity141 -- and further afield , it seems essential that @entity10 sharpens and strengthens its defense posture and plays a more proactive international role			0
to make this possible , @entity10 will have to do a number of things			0
first , the government will have to learn how to better execute its crisis management efforts using new assets such as the recently - formed @entity150			0
second , the government needs to get more creative in its efforts to enhance its international coordination and intelligence capabilities -- and ultimately defense assets -- to strengthen its security capacity			0
in addition , @entity10 needs to place greater priority on realigning its forces to meet the evolving challenges it faces			0
and finally , @entity160 must focus more on promoting greater awareness of terrorist groups such as @entity5 , and the very real and direct threat they could pose to the country			0
achieving all this will be challenging and will require investing significant political and bureaucratic capital			0
and while prime minister @entity33 's party has just won a resounding victory in a snap election , @entity10 is also dealing with an aging population and stagnant economy , so it is unclear how much in terms of energy and resources the government will have to spend on refocusing the country 's security posture			1
but as much as anything , the debate over security -- and this week 's tragic hostage situation -- are a reminder that @entity10 may increasingly find itself and its citizens in the firing line			1
a more assertive policy will expose @entity10 to more conflict and heighten its exposure to terrorism -- no small shift to handle in a remarkably safe country that for decades has turned its back on military conflict			1
how the government deals with this challenge -- and , more immediately , the aftermath of this week 's tragedy -- will shape the direction of @entity10 's national security , and its ability to protect this country 's citizens			1
