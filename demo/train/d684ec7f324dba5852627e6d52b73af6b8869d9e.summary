-- the debate over teacher evaluations that 's taken center stage in the @entity6 schools strike could have major effects on the issue in the future , an education expert says			1
" @entity6 absolutely matters , " said @entity10 , senior associate for public policy engagement at the @entity12			1
" i think what happens here will substantially matter for what we see happen with teacher evaluations nationwide , " she said			2
in the last three years , 21 states have passed have legislation or implemented new regulations designed to highlight teacher accountability , according to a report by @entity23 , a consulting firm			1
the changes came often by way of the kind of standardized testing that one @entity29 board member referred to as " data - driven madness			0
" my view : a parent 's take on the @entity36 teachers strike in many -- but not all -- cases , the reforms were hotly contested , with teachers unions saying the changes put jobs at risk without enough evidence they would work in the way both sides say reforms should work -- helping students learn , said @entity49 , a @entity23 analyst who tracks teacher effectiveness policy nationwide			1
" in a lot of places , this has been fairly controversial , but that has not been universal , " she said			0
for instance , in @entity56 , teachers unions sued over a 2010 law implementing teacher effectiveness standards in return for funding under president @entity62 's @entity64 initiative			1
but in @entity68 , unions and state officials worked together on a law that calls for incentive pay based on performance , according to @entity72			0
similar issues have arisen elsewhere			0
in @entity76 , negotiations on a new contract stalled for a while , in part over differences in teacher evaluations			2
in 2009 , then - @entity83 schools superintendent @entity81 ignited a firestorm with a teacher evaluation model that put heavy emphasis on standardized test scores			1
at the time , the president of the @entity89 called the evaluation standard a " flawed instrument with many loopholes			0
" many of the state changes were part of what @entity72 's @entity23 report referred to as an " unprecedented wave of legislation , " much of which could be traced back to the $ 4.25 billion @entity64 program			1
the 2009 initiative offers states money under a competitive grant program in return for adopting teacher effectiveness standards and a host of other reforms			1
it 's been an attractive proposition to reform advocates and to many cash - strapped state governors and legislatures -- do something to make teachers more accountable , among other things , and we 'll give you more money , @entity10 said			0
and unions have moved on the issue of accepting updated evaluation standards , dropping wholesale opposition for nuanced support			0
voices of the strike last year in @entity6 , for instance , delegates to the @entity129 's annual conference approved a new policy statement that calls for " robust evaluations by highly qualified evaluators using multiple indicators , not a single narrow metric			1
" but those same unions have hotly contested such changes , arguing that making high - stakes decisions about teaching jobs should n't flow from the results of standardized test scores alone			0
" unions do n't want teachers being evaluated on student achievement because , the strongest argument or the most common one is , there are too many factors outside control of teachers , " @entity10 said			2
in @entity76 , where the teachers union has been fighting with city officials over evaluations , union officials wrote on their website that the race to the @entity64 money " will dry up shortly , leaving bad policy in its wake			1
we can not afford to give up our fight to restore some common sense to what have been mislabeled reforms			2
" key issues in the strike but the drumbeat for change is unlikely to abate , @entity10 said			2
" there is a clear sign that teacher evaluation is changing and will change , " she said			0
" where it will go and what it will look like is still up for grabs			0
" teachers : why do you teach ?			0

after @entity64 initiative , fights over teacher *responsibility* have become more common
the initiative provides funding to states in exchange for reforms
the @entity6 schools strike could influence the outcome of the debate , expert says
