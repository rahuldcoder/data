-- the new @entity2 tv could be @entity4 ' best sleight - of - hand trick yet			2
during his modest introduction of the device , @entity4 called the @entity8 " one more hobby			1
" but a closer look at the code and the hardware powering the @entity8 reveals that there 's a lot more going on under the hood than the ceo shared			2
interestingly , @entity4 did n't mention that @entity8 runs @entity16 , the same operating system running on its flagship product , the @entity18 , and some other big hits -- the @entity20 and @entity21			1
and there 's more , too : the @entity8 's software may already be jailbroken , and some hidden software should eventually allow you to share the @entity8 's media with other @entity28 devices			1
these secret ingredients could be the recipe @entity2 needs to shake up the television industry			0
for years , @entity2 executives have labeled the set - top box a " hobby " product because of its mild success compared to blockbuster sellers like the @entity18 and @entity20			1
now that @entity8 has been revamped into a streaming rental service with an arsenal of stealth features , maybe @entity2 has a chance to change the tv business -- if not today , perhaps later			2
" the most important hint of @entity2 's real ambitions in the living room come from @entity49 , which puts iphones and @entity21 in the driver 's seat and makes the tv just an output device for the @entity2 ecosystem , " said @entity43 , a @entity44 analyst , in a recent e-mail statement			0
" expect @entity2 to gradually push more and more in that direction , but as of this moment in 2010 , @entity2 has not yet made a significant play for control of the tv			0
" here , we round up the juicy tidbits we 've heard about @entity2 's mysterious new set - top box			0
ios and third - party app support there 's more than enough evidence proving that the @entity8 runs @entity28			1
dispelling any doubts , @entity2 recently posted a build of @entity16 specifically for the @entity8			2
this piece of information about @entity28 is important because of a new feature called @entity49 , which streams media from your @entity21 , @entity18 or @entity20 to the @entity8			1
when @entity4 demonstrated @entity49 , he only showed the feature working with an @entity21 's built - in video player , photo app and music library			2
now that we know @entity8 runs @entity28 , it 's likely that third - party apps such as @entity82 at @entity83 will be able stream media to the set - top box , too			1
@entity87 blogger @entity86 confirmed that an @entity49 button is showing up in the @entity82 at @entity89 , and he adds that apps using the built - in media controller will be able to integrate @entity49			0
long story short , you 'll be able to wirelessly stream media from some third - party apps straight to your @entity8 with an @entity49 button			0
@entity49 is shaping up to be @entity2 's secret weapon to reshape home entertainment			0
in addition to @entity49 , the fact that @entity8 is running @entity16 means that -- in principle , at least -- it may someday be able to run applications from the @entity103			1
for now , that capability is not included in @entity8 , but the underlying operating system certainly supports it , so @entity2 might open a tv @entity103 in a future software update			1
jailbreaking hacks third - party app support will probably be limited for the @entity8 , but that 's where the jailbreakers come in			2
in the same way that we 're able to override restrictions on the @entity18 , @entity21 or @entity20 with a jailbreak , we should be able to run unauthorized apps on the @entity8 -- something @entity4 would never advertise , of course			1
in fact , hackers already have a head start , because a tool called @entity125 , which was used to jailbreak the newest @entity20 , already works with the @entity8 , according to the @entity126			2
that means we should be expecting hackers to code some unauthorized apps soon to unlock additional capabilities such as video conferencing via your @entity8			0
on top of that , existing hacks for the old @entity8 should work , too			0
@entity126 member @entity136 explained that " the new @entity137 seems to be a mashup of the old @entity137 and @entity16 , " meaning " frappliances , " plug - ins that add functionality to the old @entity8 , should work as well			0
' @entity143 ' app the @entity145 's @entity144 , a popular @entity28 programmer , took a close look at the @entity8 's software and discovered that it runs an application called @entity149 -- the software containing the set - top box 's media interface			1
@entity144 dug deeper and found lines of code that suggest that @entity155 might eventually be extended to other @entity28 devices			0
in other words , you should be able to share media from the @entity8 to your @entity18 , @entity20 or @entity21 , whereas originally we thought we 'd only be able to do the converse with @entity49			1
this functionality would be comparable to a @entity163 or an @entity164			0
@entity155 is n't readily available for @entity2 's @entity28 mobile devices yet , but @entity16 developer @entity166 has already managed to load @entity155 on an @entity20 running @entity16 4.1 , demonstrated in the video above			1
he recommended against doing it yourself , though , unless you 're ready to reformat your @entity18 on a regular basis just to turn it back into a phone			0
