-- @entity2 president @entity1 has suggested that some outside governments may urge rebels to attack international inspectors sent into war - fractured country to secure its arsenal of chemical weapons			1
" there might be countries that might ask the terrorists to attack the inspectors to prevent them from doing their job , and blame the @entity2 government , " he said in an interview aired sunday by @entity12 state broadcaster cctv			1
" at this point , this remains just a possibility and we can not know until the inspectors arrive in @entity2 , " @entity1 said			1
@entity2 submitted an initial declaration to the world 's chemical weapons watchdog last week outlining its inventory of the munitions			1
the move was part of a deal forged earlier this month by the @entity30 and @entity31 to begin @entity2 's chemical disarmament			1
photos : the omnipresence of @entity1 in @entity2 the plan faces several potential roadblocks			2
for starters , there is disagreement between @entity40 and @entity41 about how to determine whether @entity2 is failing to meet its disarmament obligations , according to two sources with knowledge of talks at the @entity46			1
the @entity30 wants the @entity46 's executive council to decide if @entity2 is in breach -- in which case a two - thirds majority of member states can make a decision , one source said			1
the @entity31 , however , want the determination to be made by the the @entity55 -- where @entity31 has veto power			0
@entity2 has agreed to a @entity31 - @entity30 timeline for the removal of its chemical weapons , but the plan has to be sanctioned as a @entity55 resolution			1
diplomats have said the @entity55 ca n't pass a resolution without the @entity46 first agreeing on how it would be implemented			0
the plan calls for international inspectors in position to secure that arsenal no later than november			2
veteran weapons inspectors have said securing and destroying the @entity2 stockpile could take huge numbers of people , including hundreds of inspectors and thousands of troops to provide security			0
@entity74 noted that the plan requires his government to ensure the safety of the inspectors			0
he said the weapons stockpile is secure , despite the civil war raging in @entity2			0
" chemical weapons are safely stored to prevent terrorists or groups from other countries from taking them over , " @entity1 told @entity79			0
one woman 's story : in @entity2 , inmates suffer the most ' large quantities ' asked if it was true that there are more than 1,000 tons of chemical weapons in @entity2 , he said , " @entity2 has been producing these weapons for decades , and it is quite natural that there are large quantities of them			0
" we are in a state of war , and we have territories that have been occupied for over 40 years , " he continued			0
" but at any event , the @entity2 army was geared toward fighting with conventional weapons			0
" the @entity30 and other @entity103 nations blame @entity1 's regime for an august 21 chemical weapons attack outside @entity106 that @entity30 officials estimate killed 1,400 people			1
@entity31 and @entity2 say they think rebels used the weapons			2
citing international norms against the use of chemical weapons , @entity30 president @entity112 called for authorization from @entity117 to use military force in @entity2			2
as the @entity30 threatened force to degrade @entity1 's ability to carry out chemical weapons attacks , a diplomatic opportunity arose between @entity31 and the @entity30 to put @entity2 's stockpile under international control			1
@entity30 secretary of state @entity125 said he and @entity31 foreign minister @entity126 hammered out the deal in @entity128 , and @entity2 agreed to it			2
@entity2 chemical weapons list more complete than anticipated @entity0 's @entity131 , @entity132 and @entity133 contributed to this report .			0
