-- an old - fashioned , tastefully constrained supernatural thriller , " @entity1 " embraces the elements of gothic horror movies with pleasing seriousness : if there 's a door handle to rattle or floorboard to creak in the ruined mansion at the heart of the story 's trouble , this production pauses for the sight and sound			1
and gray @entity16 skies with a likelihood of thick @entity16 mist is the unchanging weather forecast			0
the upside is , this classically creepy , unironic tale of loss and vengeance , based on @entity25 's popular 1983 novel of the same name , pays fair homage to the kind of fare that has long been the specialty of the recently revived @entity31 company @entity30 , where @entity32 once reigned as @entity33 and @entity34 personified @entity35			1
the downside is , " @entity1 " devotes an awful lot of time to the sight of @entity40 , playing a sad , frock - coated lawyer named @entity42 , creeping anxiously through that haunted house , clutching a candle and an axe , getting nowhere			1
' @entity46 ' : @entity48 ratings drizzle deadened with grief four years after the death of his wife , @entity42 is dispatched to a remote @entity16 village to sort out a deceased woman 's estate			2
there , in his own melancholy , the lawyer barely notices how fear has warped the secretive residents of the village , all of whom know and none of whom will tell an outsider what ails them			0
( @entity67 ¡ n @entity66 and " @entity70 " @entity69 nominee @entity68 have fun playing the village 's wealthiest residents , the only two who provide hospitality			2
) @entity42 does , at least , begin to wonder about the unusual death rate of village children			0
oh , if ghosts could talk ! instead , this inconsolable spirit makes her feelings known through more ghoulish means			0
@entity83 , @entity84 in @entity86 ' @entity85 ' for a certain target audience , of course , the chief selling point of " @entity1 " is the appearance of @entity40 in his first adult , big - screen outing of the post- " @entity94 " era			1
these dan - ites can be assured that the handsome , self - possessed 22 - year - old actor delivers nicely , conveying a lot in a performance that requires an excessive amount of silent tiptoeing			0
the horror - loving audience who wants to be scared silly , on the other hand , ought to know that , tv ads featuring night - vision footage of freaked out preview patrons to the contrary , this is a movie of quiet spookiness rather than loud @entity111 s. b - see full article at @entity0			1
