-- on a recent visit to @entity2 , @entity3 , my local translator , who told me he was becoming increasingly interested in physics as he listened to my responses to reporters ' questions , commented that he could n't believe the biggest advances in my field will come not from @entity13 but from @entity14 -- for him , an unexpected turn			1
the @entity16 , the enormous machine that collides protons to study matter at higher energies and shorter distances than ever is in @entity14 ( near @entity22 , @entity23 ) and not in @entity13 , where most important particle physics discoveries have taken place in the past			1
the @entity14 community has remained steadfastly supportive of this international enterprise and , unlike @entity13 of late , recognizes the importance of maintaining its scientific commitments			1
if current political discussions are any indication , @entity13 is in danger not only of losing scientific leadership but also of losing respect for the scientific method itself			1
this is at a time when the type of clear and rational thinking that science teaches us is more relevant than ever			1
given the challenging problems we face today , our country needs to embrace the scientific values that have served us so well			1
much of our economy , from the ever - tinier and more powerful products of our electronics industry to the most cost - effective manufacturing processes to the latest marketing and advertising tactics , has emerged from scientific advances and reasoning			1
so have many sensible government policies and programs , even if they are often also politically compromised			2
science features prominently in many current debates , including those over climate change , searches for alternative energy sources and progress in medical care			1
but other issues that are n't strictly scientific also involve the big numbers and complicated interwoven decisions for which scientific thinking can help			1
yes science is difficult and some people feel disempowered by how much we need to understand			1
but so are such challenges as establishing stability in the @entity73 , fixing the economy , restoring job growth and ensuring financial stability			0
the scientific method lets us see how various policies have fared elsewhere ( through observation and experiment ) and in other cases we can anticipate the expected results of various policies			1
of course political factors enter , too , in policy debates in which actual scientific facts do n't necessarily dominate the decision - making process			1
but in all cases , having a logical framework with which to move forward makes sense			0
science gives us a systematic way of incorporating what we know and do n't know into a consistent logical framework			1
it does n't say we know all the answers , but it does tell us the likelihood of particular outcomes and how well we can trust our predictions			0
at particle colliders , we know that if certain theories are correct , certain particles should appear a given fraction of the time and we can determine how many collisions we would need for a signal of new phenomena to emerge			0
when we decide on regulations , we have to estimate the likely cost of damages and the likely benefits of providing new rules			0
scientists carefully consider the questions we ask , the uncertainties in our assumptions and the precision of our results			0
even though science can be good for all of us , scientific issues in @entity13 have taken on political overtones			1
as @entity124 asked me on the @entity126 , why do people resist science and why are scientists accused of working for the @entity128 , or either party for that matter ? the answer i gave then is probably indeed one way to understand the problem			1
science is difficult in many cases			1
the shortcut to presenting reasoned arguments is to present the conclusions of scientists rather than the detailed logic and reasoning that went into their decisions			0
debates become " he said , she said " ( actually more often " he said , he said " )			0
not only does this distort the balance of what people really think --- rarely do both opinions carry equal weight -- but even worse , personalizing the arguments becomes a shortcut for describing the issues themselves			1
that leaves science and facts open to politicization that presenting actual facts can potentially avert			1
part of being a good scientist is the ability to find answerable questions , hopefully ones that shed light on larger , more difficult problems			1
i recently heard a leading economist compare financial crises to avalanches , the idea being that avalanches are the result of small pressures building up to massive instabilities that are difficult to predict			0
a scientist who worries about avalanches ( or any mountain guide worth their fee ) would know the indicators of avalanches , the slope and type of snow , and would furthermore know how to check for danger before heading down a slope			0
they would also recognize a slope that is likely to fail , even if they ca n't say exactly when			0
in the case of markets , a scientific way of thinking would also involve trying to find indicators of problems and tests that predict ( based on experimental data ) when situations are likely to get out of hand			1
scientists do n't just throw up their hands and say a problem is too difficult			0
they look for inroads , while at the same time acknowledging the potential limitations of their results			0
though scientists rely on expert opinions , the opinion of any scientist , no matter how important , ultimately has to be verified through facts			0
everyone who is interested is free to examine data or evaluate ideas			0
a promising direction or an objection to existing suggestions will ultimately be heard			0
the key currency in science is reputation			2
scientists know they have to pay attention to both good ideas and to objections , because science is unforgiving			2
golden parachutes do n't exist			0
presented with mounting debt and budget shortfalls , we now hear proposals to cut @entity13 's investment in education , infrastructure , science and technology			1
but that is like dealing with a water shortage by cutting the roots out of trees			0
yes the water is more obviously needed for the dry brittle branches , but nothing will survive if we cut off the source			0
i 'm encouraged in an odd sort of way by the e-mails i get and the interviews i 've had with people whose political affiliations are at opposite poles from mine			2
despite what we might hear and what politicians might say , science is not just the domain of a liberal elite			2
it 's encouraging to get mail from someone who is hopeful his daughters learn science , even if he subsequently put me on his tea party mailing list			2
@entity262 and the scientific method are part of progress			2
with science we do n't always know where results will take us			2
no one knew electricity would change the face of the planet when it was discovered or that quantum mechanics would lead to the electronics revolution			0
but a scientifically advanced society values progress and education , and is prepared to think rationally about the issues we face			0
the arguments might be more subtle and some people might be resistant at first			2
but if policymakers show they believe what scientific results say , even those who are skeptical or afraid might come around			2
they should n't be ashamed of employing science , they should be proud of it			2
and the electorate , if they are concerned about our future , should start demanding they do so			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity293 .			1

@entity293 says @entity13 has lost leadership in some parts of science
the top research tool in her field of physics , the @entity16 , is in @entity14
she says many have lost faith in the value of scientific thinking
@entity310 : science provides a rigorous and open way for people to find the truth
