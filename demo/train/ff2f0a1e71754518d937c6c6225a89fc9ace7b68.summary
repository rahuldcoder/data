-- democracy is a universal value and aspiration , unbound by region , ethnicity , culture or religion			1
in the last two decades , it has spread across the world in unprecedented ways			0
elections are fundamental to the ethos and principles of democracy			1
they provide citizens with a say in the decisions that affect them and governments with a legitimate authority to govern			0
when elections are credible , free and fair , they can help promote democracy , human rights and security			1
but when elections are fraudulent , as we have seen in a number of countries , they can trigger political instability and even violence			1
this means that for democracy to fulfill its potential as a means of peacefully resolving social and political conflict , the integrity of elections is crucial			1
threats to electoral integrity are not limited to poor , divided or war - torn countries			1
they can be found in every democracy			1
many of the countries that embraced democracy in the last 20 years now struggle to entrench democratic governance			1
in some long - standing democracies , citizen trust and confidence in democratic institutions have dropped precipitously			2
opinion : politics by mob in @entity55 and @entity56 global recession and rising inequality are putting pressure on older democracies to show that they are relevant to their citizens ' concerns			2
the infusion of money in politics , for example , threatens to hollow out democracy			2
and recent events in the @entity56 and @entity69 demonstrate that revolutionary transitions hold both opportunities and dangerous pitfalls			0
in response to these concerns , a group of former political leaders and leading figures have come together to create the report , " deepening democracy , " which stresses the crucial importance of integrity in elections in advancing democracy , security and development			1
elections with integrity by themselves will not build citizen trust in democracy			1
but they can be an important step in achieving the goal			0
our report identifies five challenges for countries to overcome			1
first , the need to strengthen the rule of law so that elections and the rights of voters and candidates can be protected			2
second , professional and independent national bodies should manage elections so that they are credible and the results are legitimate			1
i saw for myself in @entity108 the catastrophic impact of the failure of the country 's electoral commission to deliver these goals in the 2007 disputed presidential contest , when 1,300 people were killed and over 600,000 displaced in waves of unprecedented post-election violence			2
we must prevent this kind of tragedy from ever repeating			0
third , greater efforts are needed to build the institutions , processes and behaviors that are vital for genuine multi-party competition and division of power			0
they would bestow legitimacy on the winner , provide security for the losers , and end the " winner - takes - all " politics that discourages democratic practice			0
fourth , the integrity of elections requires political equality			2
the barriers that prevent voting and wider participation in political life must be removed			0
too often , women , young people , minorities and other marginalized groups are not given a full opportunity to exercise their democratic rights			0
finally , unregulated money in politics undermines voters ' faith in elections and confidence in democracy			1
vote buying and bribery of candidates , including by organized crime , have to be prevented in both aspiring and mature democracies			2
and we must tackle the explosive growth in campaign expenditures that is damaging confidence in electoral equality by strengthening fears that wealth buys political influence			2
these are all , of course , political challenges			0
but politicians can not resolve them alone			0
civil society and the media play their roles and have responsibilities as well			0
opinion : what if @entity178 stops policing the world ? in addition , international funding ought to support democratic reform and electoral integrity rather than , as happened too often in the past , prop up authoritarian regimes			2
this entails increased efforts to prevent abuse throughout the political and electoral cycle and not just around a particular ballot			0
our report provides a strategy on a global level			0
governments need to regulate political donations and spending , and require full transparency and disclosure of donations with penalties for non-compliance			0
organizations that manage elections in each country must come together to create international standards of professionalism , independence and competence against which they agree to be measured			0
a new transnational organization should be created to grade countries on their elections and to sound the alarm about electoral malpractice			1
the international community can then agree clearly on " red lines " of extreme electoral abuse , which would trigger condemnation and , if necessary , sanction			0
such a program for delivering elections with integrity -- with its emphasis on inclusion , transparency and accountability -- can promote better governance , greater security and human development			1
