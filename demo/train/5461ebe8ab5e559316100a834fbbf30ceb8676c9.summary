however , if architect @entity27 has his way , the @entity26 will soon have a new plant - filled pedestrian crossing inspired in part by @entity32			1

) the @entity35 will span the 1,204 foot - wide river and contain 2 million pounds of soil , giving root to 270 trees , as well as innumerable shrubs , bushes , and flowers			1
the project is led by actress @entity44 , star of the cult favorite @entity45			0

in 2012 she turned to architect @entity27 , who crafted the cauldron for the @entity56 and successfully redesigned the city 's iconic double - decker buses , to help make it a reality			1
this is no mean feat. " we need to hold up this large weight , complete with worms , rainwater and decomposing leafy mulch , without letting the bridge structure become visually more important than the garden , " says @entity27			0
" to do this and not resort to tall steel columns and cables that compete with the trees on the bridge , we are bunching all our structure underneath the garden around the two river columns			2

the perimeter could have been smoothed , but @entity27 saw potential in a saw - toothed solution			2
he was inspired by the scene in @entity89 when @entity32 took @entity90 to the bow of their doomed ship and proclaimed , " i 'm the king of the world ! " adding these ridges to the perimeter creates semi-private " balconies " allowing couples to reenact the scene			1
his hope is that this feature , and others , provide places to pass the time , kiss , and even propose while traversing the city			0
the design thinking that goes beyond movie catchphrases , romantic notions and the landscape has been carefully orchestrated			0
plants near the entryways on either side will be wild common river varieties like birches and willows			1
as pedestrians proceed , stately oaks and manicured shrubs will dot the landscape , and the center of the bridge will have little vegetation to create better views of the river and skyline			2
the concept is conceptually similar to other elevated gardens like @entity129 's @entity128 or @entity131 ' @entity130 , but the technical challenge is ratcheted up given its location over the river and the new construction that 's required			2
structural engineering firm @entity136 and landscape designer @entity137 helped give the concept form , while dealing with the unique technical challenges of a green bridge			0
" we will only be using plants which we feel will cope with the special challenges posed by a garden in the middle of a river , " says @entity137 , who also promises that there will be species that thrive in each season , giving residents and tourists something to look at no matter when they cross			1

during that time the bridge contained homes , shops , and was a center of commerce and community as well as a river crossing			1
however , since the last building was demolished in 1762 , bridges have become more utilitarian			0
" it 's not surprising that for centuries it has been treated like an obstacle to breach , rather than an opportunity for people to spend time above a vast piece of nature in the heart of our city , " says @entity27			0
the @entity35 is expected to cost $ 245 million , and @entity44 has already raised half that amount from private backers			1
@entity19 mayor @entity188 has promised another $ 50 million , and if the trust set up to fund the project can harvest the balance of the seed money , it could be ready by the spring of 2017			2
