a @entity43 , @entity8 , hospital where @entity3 was receiving care for a progressive neurological disease refused to perform a tracheotomy , a surgical procedure in which an opening is made into the airway through an incision in the neck to allow for suction of fluid out of the lungs			1
in court papers , doctors in @entity23 said there was no hope for recovery			0
they would not perform a tracheotomy because they considered it to be invasive and not recommended for patients who require a long - term breathing machine			2
@entity65 and @entity66 refused to accept the recommendation			2
the @entity69 ' daughter , @entity68 , had died at home in 2002 after a tracheotomy after suffering similar complications , and the family wanted to offer the same care to their son			1

instead , the boy could hear the parents ' voices and look for them , @entity76 told @entity0			0

the parents said that they , rather than physicians , should make a judgment on quality of life , @entity76 said			0
the @entity3 case caught the attention of the group @entity112 , which funded @entity3 's transfer and treatment at the @entity34			2
that hospital deemed the procedure medically appropriate and @entity3 underwent a tracheotomy there on march 21			1
in april , @entity119 , national director of @entity112 , said he considered this a " victory over the culture of death			0
