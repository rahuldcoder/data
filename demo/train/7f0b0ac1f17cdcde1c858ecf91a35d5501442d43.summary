-- the week started with all focus on golf 's latest child prodigy , but it has ended with a former wonder kid finally fulfilling her great promise			1
@entity7 claimed her first major title sunday , winning the @entity9 at her 11th attempt			1
now 24 , she triumphed by two shots from fellow @entity12 , @entity13 , holding her nerve as the world @entity15 made a final - round charge			1
" @entity18 , i ca n't believe this is happening , " an ecstatic @entity7 was quoted as saying by the @entity21 website in the aftermath of her victory			1
" obviously , there are moments of doubt in there , " she continued , referring to the prospect that she might never win a major			1
" ( but ) i had so many people surrounding me			0
they never lost faith in me			0
that 's pushed me forward			2
" this mental fortitude was on display as @entity7 overcame a double - bogey at the 16th hole , bouncing back with a birdie at the next and closing with a par to sign for a level 70			1
@entity41 also dropped a shot at 16 , but finished with two birdies to card a four - under - par 66 that left her level for the tournament			2
she finished one ahead of @entity50 's 22 - year - old @entity49 , who birdied her last hole to take third place in her professional debut ahead of @entity55 's @entity54			1
most of the talk at the start of the tournament , which was played at @entity60 -- also host of the men 's equivalent the previous week -- was on 11 - year - old @entity63			1
the @entity12 was the youngest qualifier to start the event , but missed the halfway cut after carding two rounds of 78 , though she impressed many with her mature attitude			0
@entity7 first competed in an @entity71 event when she was 12 , then turned pro when she was 15 and also played in several men 's tournaments while still a teenager			1
at age 16 , she made the cut at the 2006 @entity80 men 's event in @entity55 , reportedly receiving a higher appearance fee than the winner took home			2
before this week , she had won four titles on the @entity71 -- but her best result in a major was runner - up at the @entity88 earlier this season , and as an amateur at the @entity91			2
@entity92 wins @entity93 on the men 's @entity95 , @entity94 birdied his last seven holes in a row to overtake @entity99 , @entity100 , and @entity101 and claim a sensational @entity103 victory at @entity104			1
the 35 - year - old was way off the pace as he headed on to the back nine but made birdie on the 411 - yard par - four 12th to signify the beginning of a red hot charge that would see him claim the outright lead on 15 - under - par at the last			0
@entity94 had to wait for @entity100 and @entity99 to finish their rounds but the chasing pair could n't make birdie at the 18th sealing a remarkable triumph for the @entity12			0
the win marks first time a player has ever birdied the last seven holes of a tournament to win a title on the @entity95			2
" ( it was ) just one of those days where i felt i could n't miss , " a delighted @entity94 told @entity121 after reaching the club house			0
@entity100 and @entity99 finished joint second on 14 - under - par while @entity101 ended the day a shot further back in fourth at 13 - under - par. @entity12 's @entity126 and @entity127 tied for fifth at 12 - under - par. @entity128 holds on in @entity129 @entity130 's @entity128 held off @entity132 's @entity131 to win the @entity133 at @entity134 in @entity129 by a single shot			0
@entity128 had led the tournament from the opening day but suffered a late scare on the par - five last after driving a wayward tee - shot into the trees			0
the 34 - year - old composed himself , however , and closed out with a bogie to finish at 13 - under - par and win by the slimmest of margins			0
@entity145 's @entity144 and @entity147 duo @entity146 and @entity148 finished the day tied for third on 11 - under - par behind second placed @entity131 on 12 - under			0
home favorite @entity149 , meanwhile , failed to secure a much desired first win on @entity153 soil as a poor putting display ensured he ended the tournament in sixth position at 10 - under - par.			0

@entity7 wins the first major title of her career at @entity9
@entity162 triumphs by two strokes at @entity60 in @entity164
