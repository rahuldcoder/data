-- despite the escalating violence in @entity4 that led to the suspension of monitoring activities , the @entity2 can continue to play a crucial role in the embattled country , @entity1 ban ki - moon says in a report to be presented to the @entity10			1
an advance copy of the report , which is circulating among @entity10 members , was obtained by @entity0 ahead of a wednesday briefing on @entity4 to the council by @entity16			1
the document outlines the efforts to implement a six - point plan that would impose a cease - fire and take measures to protect human rights , and admits that it has not worked			2
in some places , the levels of violence are even higher today than they were before an initial cease - fire attempt , the report says			2
military : shelling from @entity4 hits @entity30 the 300 - strong @entity2 team in @entity4 , whose mission is to observe and help implement the plan , has been unable to do its work as envisioned because of present conditions , the document states			1
last month , the @entity2 announced that it was pulling back its unarmed monitors because of escalating violence			2
opposition groups slammed the international body for the suspension of its work			0
the @entity2 mission 's role in @entity4 was based on the premise that there would be a cessation to the violence , and failing that , " a calibration of effort in response to the situation on the ground would be appropriate , " @entity43 writes			1
basically , the three options @entity43 puts on the table are : withdrawing the @entity2 team , increasing its size or adding armed protection for them ; or retooling the mission of the current team			1
@entity43 elaborates the most on the idea to shift the strategy of the current @entity2 team			1
the team could retain its military observer capability and continue its fact - finding work , but with a limited scope in light of the violence in @entity4 , the report says			1
in this scenario , the @entity2 mission would move its personnel from the field back to @entity77 , where it would focus on pushing forward the six - point plan to the @entity4 government and the opposition			1
" from a central hub in @entity77 , the civilian component would continue liaison and dialogue with opposition and @entity88 representatives in the provinces as security conditions allow , " @entity43 writes			2
the other options -- withdrawal or augmentation of the force -- could have more negative consequences than good , the report concludes			0
photos : in @entity4 hospital , no escape from war withdrawing from @entity4 would ensure the safety of the team , but it could signal a loss of confidence in the hopes of a cease - fire and leave the @entity2 without a way to monitor progress , the report says			1
" ( withdrawing ) would likely precipitate a further blow to efforts to stabilize the situation on the ground , and render the prospect of a negotiated @entity4 - led transition , as laid out by the @entity115 , more difficult , " @entity43 writes			2
expanding the size of the mission , with or without armed protection , poses an " unacceptably high " security risk , given that there are no signs of the violence receding immediately , the report says			0
these options must be considered , @entity43 writes , because " in spite of the best efforts of ( the mission ) to support the parties in the effort to de-escalate the crisis , there is not a cessation of violence , and the basic human rights whose protection is at the core of the ( six - point ) plan continue to be violated , " the report says			1
according to the opposition @entity140 in @entity4 , 71 people , including 10 defectors , were killed across the country			0
in fighting in @entity147 since friday , four @entity4 troops and one opposition fighter were killed , another group , the @entity144 said			0
heavy fighting was reported in @entity150 , where the town of @entity152 was shelled by forces who tried to raid it , the group said			0
@entity155 was reported in several suburbs of @entity77			0
the state - run @entity158 news agency reported at least four different incidents where " terrorist " attacks were foiled by security forces throughout the country			0
according to the agency , more than 11 fighters it identified as " terrorists " were killed by security forces , and at least 10 vehicles , some with weapons inside , were destroyed			0
@entity0 can not independently verify government and opposition claims of casualties because access to @entity4 by international journalists has been severely curtailed			0
analysis : @entity4 options dwindling			0
