@entity1 's food police are patrolling and arresting suspicious @entity3 dairy products , which are either delicious cheese or a bacteria - laden menace			1
the @entity8 reports that @entity10 rules could effectively ban age - old recipes for cheeses like @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16			1
according to @entity20 's righteous cheese shop manager , @entity19 , imported soft cheeses of all kinds are especially hard to come by			1
" there 's a lot of confusion ( over the rules ) ... getting hold of any soft cheese is really a pain , " @entity19 said			2
the @entity10 says it is not aware of a cheese shortage			2
the food safety agency 's concern is with the cheeses ' two main ingredients : raw milk and bacteria			0
too bad for foodies , the @entity10 does n't care that bacteria makes cheese			1
since bacteria like @entity37 and listeria kill people , all bacteria must be bad , right ? well , the problem is our bodies are teeming with bacteria , even the dreaded @entity37 , according to the @entity43			2
although we have plenty of non-toxigenic @entity37 in our intestines , the toxic kind kills			0
the @entity10 is testing for all kinds and giving out failing grades to cheeses that had too much of the non-toxigenic e. coli as well			1
while non-toxigenic @entity37 wo n't kill consumers , if a food production facility has it on the food , the @entity10 , after a long review process , determines it must be filthy			0
according to @entity10 spokeswoman @entity63 , " the current level is in line with standards around the world , and @entity10 expects that properly manufactured milk products , whether made from raw milk or pasteurized milk , should not be affected			0
" presumably @entity3 does not agree			0
in this case , the @entity10 made a new rule in 2010 to reduce the amount of allowable @entity37 by 90 %			0
but field officers had n't been enforcing it until recently , according to the @entity69 's executive director , @entity68			0
the fact that the @entity3 producers of @entity13 can trace their production lineage back a millennium does n't seem to matter to the @entity10			1
earlier this year , the @entity10 similarly proposed banning wood - board aged cheeses because of bacteria			2
@entity3 cheese makers are n't the only ones on the front lines of the @entity10 's war on raw milk			1
the @entity10 also has launched raids of @entity84 farms to wipe out the scourge of raw milk .			0

@entity10 rules target bacteria in @entity3 cheese
the bad kind of e. coli bacteria is the *culprit*
there is confusion over the rules , says a cheese shop manager
