editor 's note : @entity2 is the editor - in - chief of @entity4 and the author of " free : the @entity7 " , published by @entity8 on july 7			1
the book 's first printing generated controversy over failing to attribute some passages to @entity13 , which @entity2 said in his blog was a mistake and will be corrected			1
@entity2 says technology allows giants like @entity18 to give away services			1
( @entity20 ) -- when @entity24 was confirmed in may as the @entity27 administration 's top antitrust cop , some of her words from last year sent a chill through the @entity29 , the search engine 's headquarters in @entity31			1
during the waning days of the @entity34 administration , @entity32 worried that the government would not do enough about @entity18 : " i think we 're going to continually see a problem , potentially , with @entity18 , who i think so far has acquired a monopoly in @entity40 online advertising lawfully			2
" now she 's in a position to do something about it			0
having a legally obtained monopoly is not a crime , but abusing it to gain unfair advantages in other markets can be			0
the most recent landmark cases on this in technology have been the decade - long investigations and prosecutions on @entity55 's dominance of pc software			1
in those cases , competitors complained that the software giant 's near - monopoly on operating systems allowed it to get the upper hand in other markets , for example , by gaining an advantage on the web through bundling @entity55 's @entity67 with every copy of @entity69			1
now @entity18 has @entity55 - like dominance in search and search advertising			1
what should it not be allowed to do ? that question may come to define this era of antitrust law			0
when @entity32 was confirmed , she withdrew the @entity34 administration 's report setting relatively conservative standards of antitrust enforcement and declared , " the @entity82 will be aggressively pursuing cases where monopolists try to use their dominance in the marketplace to stifle competition and harm consumers			1
" how might @entity18 's dominance be harming consumers ? ask makers of such items as books and newspapers and advertisers and all will say they are concerned about @entity18 's clout and ability to act unilaterally because of its dominance			1
@entity18 , meanwhile , has been on a charm offensive for the past few weeks , emphasizing how easy it is for consumers to switch to other search engines and how small it is compared to other companies that have been in a similar position in the past , such as @entity55 , @entity106 and @entity107			1
the @entity66 is still a new territory , with the boundary lines of markets in flux			0
at least in the @entity55 case , we knew what an " operating system " and " web browser " were			2
but on the @entity66 , where software is a web site , not something you buy in a box , and everything is just one click away from everything else , core antitrust concepts such as " lock - in " and " barriers to entry " will have to be redefined			0
one of the most interesting issues that @entity32 will have to face is @entity18 's use of free			1
this is not 20th century " free , " as in " buy one , get one free " or " free gift inside			0
" instead , it 's really free ( let 's dignify it with a capital @entity137 ) , something that 's only possible in the digital age , where costs are close to zero			0
like many web companies , @entity18 gives away most of what it does			2
its searches are free , as are its e-mail , maps , online word processor and spreadsheet , and nearly 300 other products , from directory assistance ( @entity150 ) to @entity151			0
this use of @entity153 is part of its " max strategy " -- it uses @entity153 to get its products in the hands of the greatest number of users , and then figures out some way to get money from them ( mostly with ads , but sometimes with " pro " versions of the services , in which users can pay for more storage or features , using the " freemium " business model )			0
@entity18 can give away so much because the incremental cost of serving one more web page to one more user is almost nothing -- and falling as technology gets cheaper			1
this is the difference between the " bits economy " and the " atoms economy			0
" the marginal cost of production for digital things is so low that @entity153 becomes not just a marketing gimmick but the default price in most markets , driven by economic forces as real online as gravity is in the real world			2
but companies still have to make money , so there are limits to how much they can provide free			0
not a problem for @entity18			2
its core advertising business is so powerful , dominant and profitable that it can subsidize almost everything else the company does , using @entity153 to get customers in new markets			0
is that fair , when so many of its competitors do n't have a similar golden goose at the core of their operations ? the analogy is something like the semiconductor battles of the 1980s , when @entity209 companies were accused of " dumping " ( selling for under cost ) memory chips in the @entity213 market to drive out @entity213 competitors			0
any time you are giving away a product , you are by definition selling it for less than cost ( even if the cost is just a fraction of a cent )			0
note that no court or regulator has yet suggested that there 's anything remotely like this going on in the use of free online			0
but when @entity32 starts looking at ways that @entity18 is using its search dominance to win new markets , its use of @entity153 is going to have to be one of the things she considers			1
could @entity153 be ok for little companies , but not really big ones ? how much market share would you have to have in one market to disallow you from using @entity153 in another ? as she digs into this , she may find that it takes her back to @entity55 itself			2
as entrepreneur @entity242 has pointed out , @entity18 is using the profits from its search advertising dominance to fund its competition with @entity55 in word processors and spreadsheets ( @entity248 )			1
@entity55 , meanwhile , is doing just the opposite : using the profits from its dominance of word processors and spreadsheets ( @entity253 ) to subsidize its competition with @entity18 in search ( @entity256 )			1
in each case , the companies are using a highly profitable paid product to make another product free , on the hopes of gaining market share by taking price off the table			0
the difference this time is that @entity18 is the dominant player , and at least as far as search goes , @entity55 is a struggling upstart			1
confused yet ? then spare a thought for @entity32			0
she not only has to figure out what markets need protection , but also how to do that ( to say nothing of the poignant irony of @entity55 complaining about unfair monopolies )			2
who would have thought that there was anything not to like about @entity153 ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			2

@entity2 : @entity27 's antitrust chief concerned about @entity18 's power
he says she will have to decide whether it 's ok for @entity18 to give things away
he says @entity18 's dominance in ads gives it power to win new markets
@entity2 : @entity297 pits @entity18 against @entity55 , itself a target of antitrust cases
