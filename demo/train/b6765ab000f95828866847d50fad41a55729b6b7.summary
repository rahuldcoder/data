@entity0 -- watchdogs and even some members of @entity4 raised alarms tuesday after learning that the @entity6 quietly changed how lawmakers report privately funded travel worth millions of dollars a year , removing those trips from one of the most high - profile reports that members must file			2
but as the change sent out ripples of outrage , it was not clear how wide - ranging the effect would be , because the trip information remains easily accessible in a separate report			0
immediate concern two democrats immediately expressed concern			0
" both the change to our financial disclosure forms and the fact it was done so quietly are extremely troubling for those of us who believe in transparency and accountability " wrote rep. @entity23 , @entity24 , who co-chairs the @entity25			2
the rule change was made in a committee vote			0
@entity23 's office said he has requested that the committee reverse it 's decision			0
the top @entity38 in the @entity6 agrees			0
" the new rule presented by the @entity44 for disclosure of travel must be reversed , " @entity40 @entity39 of @entity41 wrote in a statement			1
" while the committee 's aim was to simplify the disclosure process , @entity4 must always move in the direction of more disclosure , not less			2
" a tale of two reports @entity39 is referring to the idea that the @entity44 may have removed the reporting requirement from the @entity56 because the trips also must be disclosed , in a more extensive form in the separate gift and @entity60			1
in the @entity56 , @entity6 members must give online summaries of each private trip in the past six months			1
but in the @entity65 , members must report the trips in detail			0
@entity68 , staff director and chief counsel for the @entity44 , issued a statement saying the panel " continues to enforce the requirement that all @entity72 and staff who wish to accept privately sponsored travel must continue to receive prior approval from the @entity44 and to file detailed paperwork about any such trip within 15 days			1
neither of those requirements has been changed or diluted in any way			0
" @entity68 noted that a database at @entity83 makes publicly available all " detailed post-travel reports ... on the same page where the public can look up members ' financial disclosure reports			1
" " as the @entity6 developed the new online financial disclosure system , the @entity44 's nonpartisan staff recommended a number of changes to the financial disclosure forms , including eliminating the need to report less information about private travel than the traveler had already publicly disclosed the year before , " the statement continued			1
" @entity99 adopted these changes and publicly highlighted them on page 2 of the financial disclosure instructions , which were provided to all financial disclosure filers and posted on the @entity44 's public web site months ago			1
the @entity44 is committed to effective and efficient public disclosure , and will continue to look for opportunities to improve the public filings required of members and staff			1
" @entity68 said the statement was authorized by @entity44 chairman @entity111 , @entity112 , and ranking @entity38 @entity113 , @entity41			1
@entity1 reached out to house speaker @entity114 , @entity115 , for reaction , but as of tuesday afternoon his office had not released any statement			0
watchdogs angry in the meantime , groups that spend countless hours combing over data about @entity4 immediately decried the change in reporting and sharply questioned whether eliminating a duplicative report was the real motivation behind the change			2
" duplication is not usually a major concern in @entity4 , " said @entity128 , the executive director of @entity129 in @entity0			0
" the only place they 're concerned about duplication is when it 's exposing their private travel			2
" @entity128 pointed out that the decision was made behind closed doors and called the @entity44 " tone - deaf , " charging that it serves more to cover up for unethical conduct than to expose it			1
why make this change in disclosure reports ? she is blunt in her belief			0
" i think they want to take more trips that they do n't want people to know about			0
" word of the @entity44 action came days after reports that longtime rep. @entity151 , @entity153 - @entity152 -- who narrowly won his party 's renomination last week -- had failed to report an all - expenses - paid trip he took to @entity157 last year			1
@entity1 's @entity158 and political editor @entity159 contributed to this report .			0

new : @entity44 responds , it is " committed to effective and efficient public disclosure "
travel reporting no longer required in @entity56
it still is required in more extensive form in the gift and @entity60
