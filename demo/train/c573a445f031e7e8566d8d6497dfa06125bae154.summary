-- normally , you might think that a controversy over whether the @entity3 , one of the nation 's leading performing arts organizations , is overlooking the contributions of @entity9 artists , actors and musicians would be a real sleeper			1
until you heard that , during a recent telephone conversation between one lover of the arts and another , one claims the other told him to " f --- yourself			2
" ok , gentlemen , you have my attention			2
it all happened very quickly			2
on sept. 14 , @entity22 , chairman of the @entity24 , and @entity25 , president of the @entity3 talked			1
in multiple media reports , @entity22 said that @entity25 took none too kindly to him expressing his concern over the constant omission of @entity30 from the annual list of @entity33 recipients			1
since 1978 , the @entity3 has chosen only two hispanics among more than 170 honorees : @entity37 tenor @entity36 and @entity39 - born performer @entity38 , who is of @entity41 descent			1
both these breakthroughs happened during @entity25 's tenure , which has lasted nearly 12 years			1
in 2012 , @entity30 are nearly ubiquitous			2
you 'll find them in corporate america , professional sports , music , entertainment , politics and the media			2
at 50 million people , @entity39 's largest minority is everywhere			1
except , for some reason , on the annual list of @entity54			1
opinion : why @entity30 are key in election what accounts for the discrepancy ? it is a familiar story			2
in fact , it has become something of an annual tradition , like @entity64 and @entity65 , that , when the list of @entity54 is announced each year , there wo n't be a single @entity9 name on it			1
and this tradition of omission continued this year when the 2012 honorees were announced			2
the seven artists set to receive the honor are actor @entity75 , musician @entity76 , late night tv host @entity77 , ballerina @entity78 and @entity79 , @entity80 and @entity81 , all of rock band @entity83			1
as a latino who loves the arts and believes that his community has contributed mightily to it , he is raising a ruckus			2
it 's the @entity39 thing to do			1
when we see something that is n't right , we speak up			2
we raise hell until our concerns are addressed , and the wrong is made right			2
that 's what @entity22 is doing			1
i commend him for it			0
while @entity25 refused to share with reporters the exact words he used , he did admit to the @entity101 that he used " strong language " during the call			0
he claimed it was because he thought he was being labeled a bigot			0
" i 've spent much of the last 20 years working with organizations of color in this country , @entity109 , @entity9 , @entity110 , @entity111 , " he told the @entity101			1
" this is a real part of who i am , and so when someone insinuates that i am a racist , it gets me extremely upset			0
" still , @entity25 said , he regretted his choice of words			0
@entity22 says the whole racism thing is a dodge , and that he never insinuated any such thing			0
" that was his interpretation , " he told @entity122			0
" the issue i presented was : how can you continue to exclude @entity30 from the @entity33 ... he took that to mean i was calling him a racist			0
" @entity22 suggests that what really set off @entity25 was being challenged and questioned			0
what if @entity22 did mean to imply that ? so what ? @entity25 would still be out of line			0
if he does n't like being challenged or questioned , he should go into another line of work , one further removed from the public			0
according to @entity22 , the @entity3 receives tens of millions in operating funds every year , paid for by public tax dollars			1
and its ex officio board members include the first lady			0
this is not a private enterprise			0
two weeks after the phone call , @entity25 finally did something he should have done much earlier			0
he sent a written apology to @entity22 for the call and the " unfortunate choice of words " he used " in frustration			0
" in @entity39 : it 's immigration , stupid , say @entity9 voters in @entity151 amazing			1
with @entity25 , everything comes with a qualifier			0
he was frustrated ? that implies that there was something that @entity22 did wrong to frustrate him			0
if he thinks he 's frustrated , imagine how frustrated @entity30 are to constantly have their achievements , talent , and contributions ignored by cultural elitists who think only in terms of black and white			1
@entity25 owes all @entity30 a symbolic apology , and he can express that by showing that he understands what @entity22 was upset about in the first place and proving that he is committed to addressing this disgraceful pattern of omission			0
@entity22 is scheduled to meet with @entity3 chairman @entity168 soon to discuss his concerns , which are shared by as many as 30 @entity171 organizations who have signed onto the cause			1
if @entity30 do n't get satisfaction , and more importantly some respect , we should turn the tv channel and not watch the broadcast of the @entity33 on december 2 and not buy the products of any advertiser that sponsors the show			0
it 's time to take the gloves off			1
this tempest will probably run its course , but the underlying problem remains			0
the @entity3 needs new leadership			1
the people at the top need to be let go and replaced with folks who have not just an appreciation for the arts but a firm grasp of the country they 're living in -- and the century			1
join us on @entity198 / @entity197 the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity201 .			1

since 1978 , the @entity3 has honored only two hispanics
@entity201 : center overlooks contributions of @entity9 artists , performers
he says @entity39 's largest minority is everywhere except on the @entity205 's annual list
@entity201 : @entity3 needs new leaders who understand our century
