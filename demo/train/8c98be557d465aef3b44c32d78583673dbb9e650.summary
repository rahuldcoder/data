one evening last month , a teenage suicide bomber blew himself up on the steps of the auditorium of the @entity5 cultural center in @entity6			1
the target was a crowd of @entity9 and expatriates gathered to watch a play titled " heartbeat : silence after the explosion			1
" the show was written as a condemnation of suicide bombings			1
" pieces of flesh were plastered on the wall			1
there were children and women crying for help , " said one civil society activist who spoke with @entity21 just after the suicide attack			1
a @entity28 spokesman claimed the group was responsible for the attack , and said the play was targeted because it was being performed " to insult @entity33 values and spread propaganda about our jihad operations , especially on suicide attacks			1
" sadly , for too long it has been relatively easy for citizens of the @entity40 and @entity41 to indulge in the " otherization " of this particular brand of extremist horror			1
yes , such attacks are awful and deserved condemnation , but they were , until the tragic events of this week in @entity48 , other people 's hells			1
they generally occurred in far - flung places and were committed against faraway people : schoolgoers in @entity54 and theatergoers in @entity6			1
nearly two years ago , for example , @entity56 , a 25 - year - old foreign service officer serving in @entity9 , went to deliver books to an @entity9 school , but was killed by a suicide bomber on the way			2
in the aftermath of her death , secretary of state @entity62 said : " the folks who want to kill people , and that 's all they want to do , are scared of knowledge			2
and they want to shut the doors and they do n't want people to make their choices about the future			2
for them , it 's ' you do things my way and if you do n't , we 'll throw acid in your face			2
we 'll put a bullet in your face , ' to a young girl trying to learn			2
so this is a huge challenge for us			2
it is a confrontation with modernity , with possibilities			0
" but while the media covered the tragedy , @entity56 's death remained a story that happened " over there			0
" indeed , for the past several years -- at least since attacks on @entity94 and @entity95 -- @entity96 have been able to go about their day - to - day business , with little thought to what was taking place thousands of miles away , for this was someone else 's horror			0
this has been despite the alarming rate at which the death toll has been growing , with @entity9 being forced to get accustomed to having their lives punctured by senseless attacks , including the heartbreaking slayings of an @entity9 journalist , his wife and two daughters gathered around a dinner table for a holiday celebration as a family			0
as the @entity120 in @entity9 noted recently , more civilian deaths and injuries occurred during 2014 than in any year since it began such reports in 2009			0
of particularly gruesome note was a november suicide attack targeting a crowd huddled to watch a volleyball game that killed more than 50 people , including 21 children			0
@entity129 's @entity128 released a report counting 592 suicide attacks in 2014 , which it said was a 94 % increase over the previous year , resulting in the deaths of approximately 4,400 people			0
the @entity120 put the number of civilians killed in @entity138 last year at a staggering 12,282 , more than double the number killed in 2013 true , as these numbers have soared , @entity40 have found themselves increasingly concerned			1
an august @entity142 poll , for example , found 65 % agreeing " the world is more dangerous than it was several years ago , " while just 7 % said the world has gotten safer			0
yet at the same time , more than half said the @entity40 " does not have a responsibility to do something about the violence in @entity138			1
" yet the reality is that extremists wreaking bloody havoc in @entity138 or @entity152 or @entity9 or @entity153 will not be kept at bay forever			0
nor , as an @entity9 activist who ran schools for girls during the @entity28 era once told me , will an @entity9 left to itself remain its own problem indefinitely			0
@entity40 , understandably , wants to bring to a close 13 years of conflict			1
and it may want to believe that the tide of war is really receding			0
but as the events still unfolding in @entity48 this week have demonstrated -- and as was underscored by 2013 's @entity168 bombing -- extremists are ready to bring their violence to our own shores			0
@entity41 and @entity40 are not immune to the threat			1
if " @entity175 , " a slogan adopted in solidarity with the magazine @entity178 that was attacked in @entity5 , is to mean anything , it should be about the choice to stand up in defense of those who believe in a free press , safe schools for boys and girls , and theaters free from suicide attack			0
and that means standing up for people wherever they are in the world .			0

@entity192 : @entity193 has too often ignored extremism *overseas*
@entity41 and @entity40 are not immune to threat , she says
