@entity0 is n't embracing president @entity2 's decision to reform the immigration system by executive order , but the community 's top lobbyists are n't joining republicans in slamming @entity2 's announcement , either			1
they just want the president and @entity10 to move forward on a permanent solution to fix a broken immigration system -- which they say can only happen through legislation			1
three top groups , which have descended on @entity16 to argue the economic benefits of an immigration overhaul , said arguments on the president 's authority to shield millions from deportation should take a back seat to passing legislation in the next @entity10			1
@entity25 , president of the @entity27 @entity26 , said that while @entity2 's executive actions " raise important legal and constitutional questions , " @entity10 and the president should press ahead toward the goal of achieving bipartisan legislation			1
" the debate over the president 's announcement must not be allowed to forestall progress on critical priorities , " @entity25 said in a statement			0
" we call upon the president and lawmakers of both parties to enact common sense measures to provide the @entity27 economy with the workers it needs at all skill levels , while better securing our borders and dealing with undocumented immigrants			0
" the @entity26 and other business groups joined in an unlikely coalition last year with labor groups to urge @entity10 to pass comprehensive immigration reform -- a partnership that has helped immigration advocates make headway in @entity10			1
@entity57 senior director @entity56 , who leads the group 's work to achieve immigration reform , said he was hopeful congressional @entity61 could move past @entity2 's executive action and toward bipartisan legislation by the spring			1
but @entity56 said @entity2 's decision to act unilaterally " certainly does n't help us get to a solution " and said even after @entity2 's executive orders kick in , " our immigration system will still be broken			2
" " certainly what the president did last night is n't going to make it easier for everyone to come together to fix immigration , " @entity56 said			0
" after some of the initial emotion dials down from what 's happened here , we 'll all be able to look at this constructively			0
" that emotion is resounding among @entity61 congressional leaders and potential @entity61 candidates			0
house speaker @entity81 said @entity2 " cemented his legacy of lawlessness , " sen. @entity80 said he " will not sit idly by and let the president bypass @entity10 and our @entity86 " and sen. @entity87 called @entity2 's actions unconstitutional			2
@entity81 said friday the @entity93 " will in fact act " on immigration , but did not give specifics as to how the body would respond to @entity2 's executive action			1
@entity61 hammer legal case against @entity2 on immigration @entity57 , which among other groups , lobbied @entity10 last year alongside the @entity26 and the @entity98 to pass the @entity100 's bipartisan reform bill , supports most of the policies @entity2 announced thursday , but would like to see them in the form of legislation			1
@entity56 said he is hopeful the @entity61 - led @entity93 , which did not take up the @entity100 's immigration bill , will work to pass immigration legislation or a series of smaller bills that address some of the key problems			1
on immigration , a tale of two presidents one of the key players in that effort will be rep. @entity114 , a @entity61 from @entity115 who has worked to push an immigration bill through the @entity93			0
@entity114 said he questions the legal authority of @entity2 's actions , but said friday on @entity120 that he supports " a lot of the specific things in the president 's executive order			2
" and @entity114 appeared ready to move past that question in favor of working toward legislation , arguing that voters ' message in the midterms was a call to end dysfunction and work together			1
" i 'm going to try to work with the president or anybody else , whether it 's immigration reform or other important issues , " @entity114 said			2
" i hope we can work through this			0
" @entity139 , chairman of the @entity98 , said the benefits of the policies @entity2 announced thursday will ultimately outweigh how those policies came to be			0
" you 're going to here a lot of people take issue with the process but in the end i think you have to distinguish between the process and the substance , " @entity139 said			0
but @entity139 , a close adviser to former @entity152 mayor @entity151 , who founded the group , said he is just glad " everybody in @entity155 is talking about immigration			0
" " we 're no longer arguing about whether to do immigration , " @entity139 said			0
" we might be arguing about which branch should lead , we might be arguing about the process , we might be arguing about how you do it -- but we 're not actually arguing about whether this country needs to reform its immigration policies			0
" the economic and political imperatives to reform the immigration system will ultimately prompt @entity61 to work toward legislation before the 2016 presidential election , @entity139 said , pointing to the growth of @entity173 and @entity174 as a share of the voting population			2
" @entity10 is going to have to get to work , " he said .			1
