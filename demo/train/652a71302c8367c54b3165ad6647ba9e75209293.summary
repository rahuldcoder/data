@entity0 is expected to increase patient demand for medical services			0
combine that with a worsening shortage of doctors , and next year you may have to wait a little longer to get a doctor 's appointment			1
and the crowded emergency room may become even more so			0
there are approximately 48 million uninsured people in the @entity11			1
when the mandatory insurance rules of @entity0 kick in next year , and a couple dozen states expand who is eligible for @entity15 , you can bet more people are going to want to use their health benefits			1
in fact , so many people were anxious to get access to health insurance -- many for the first time -- when the insurance marketplaces opened tuesday , more than a dozen of the websites experienced technical glitches			1
@entity0 open enrollment : everything you need to know dr. @entity29 is worried that this coming flood of newly insured patients may crash the @entity11 health care system as well			1
@entity29 works at the emergency room at the busy @entity34 right outside of @entity35 , @entity36			0
while he sees trauma cases often , a good number of the patients he sees do n't involve trauma			2
they 're the uninsured who ca n't afford to pay for a regular doctor 's visit -- so they use the emergency room instead			2
" people turn to the er because they have no other place to go after hours or they do n't have access to a level of appropriate primary care , " @entity29 said			1
" the @entity49 has become the safety net of our health care system			2
we ca n't turn anyone away like a doctor 's office could			0
... i worry though with ( @entity0 ) this will significantly increase patient volume			0
" there is already a national shortage of doctors , according to the @entity64			2
we 're down about 20,000 now , and the number is expected to get worse as nearly half the nation 's physicians are over age 50 -- meaning many are at or near retirement age			0
and it 's not just doctors who are in short supply ; we also need more nurses , according to the @entity76			0
" keep in mind the @entity0 did n't create this crisis , " said dr. @entity77 , president of the @entity78			0
" we 've got an aging population that needs more care and a growing population			0
" government shutdown forces clinical trial patients to wait a study in the @entity88 journal projected the country will need 52,000 more primary care physicians by 2025			1
most of those extra doctors are needed because of projected population growth			2
but the problem also begins in training ; only one in five graduating medical residents plan to go into primary care , according to the @entity99			1
@entity29 said he might have been interested in primary care rather than emergency care , but the lower pay kept him away			1
doctors on average graduate with hundreds of thousands of dollars of debt			0
" primary care is the backbone of our medical system , but most people i know in medical school ca n't afford to go that route , " @entity29 said			1
if the popularity of the insurance marketplaces on the first day they opened is any sign , there will be a lot more people in @entity36 fighting to get a doctor 's attention			1
problems plagued the @entity36 exchange site until midafternoon , but still more than 1,200 people had purchased policies or enrolled in @entity15 by the end of the day , according to a spokeswoman for the @entity130			0
" i think of ( @entity0 ) as giving everyone an atm card in a town where there are no atm machines , " @entity29 said			0
" the coming storm of patients means when they ca n't get in to see a primary care physician , even more people will end up with me in the emergency room			1
" what happened in @entity142 in 2006 when the state 's mandated health insurance rules went into effect illustrates the impending national problem			1
when the @entity142 law kicked in , wait times to get an appointment at primary care physicians ' offices increased significantly , and they 've remained high ever since , according to an annual survey from the @entity154			1
and @entity142 has the second highest physician - to - population ratio of any state			2
when patients could n't get doctor 's appointments they once again turned to emergency rooms			2
a @entity163 study found all 11 of the emergency rooms that researchers studied in @entity142 became busier after the law went into effect			2
the @entity0 does try to address some of the problems			0
there 's an additional $ 1.5 billion in funding allotted for the @entity171 , which provides support to health care professionals in exchange for their service in areas with a shortage ( physician numbers are particularly stretched thin in rural areas )			1
the law also puts more money toward training in hopes of increasing the primary care workforce			1
it offers more graduate positions for primary care doctors and more scholarships			1
it even offers a 10 % bonus to primary care doctors who agree to see @entity194 patients through 2015			1
the law 's emphasis on coverage for preventive care may also mean fewer people will need to visit doctors for more serious issues down the road			2
@entity77 is optimistic that this problem will be the prompt the system needs to address these long - standing issues with our medical system			0
he admits , though , that he 's a " glass - half - full kind of guy			0
" he suggests existing technology could help			0
not all patients actually need to see him personally ; if there is a way to set up an online system so patients could access records , e-mail simple questions or request prescription refills , that would cut down on the amount of time they 'd have to spend in his office			0
@entity77 also thinks a team approach would be more productive in health care practices -- something many hospitals are already trying to adopt. " in @entity229 , @entity228 , where i work , i 'm happy to see patients , but we also have a health department or retail clinics that people could go to for their flu shots or other treatments , " @entity77 said			1
" and if we maintained good communication with those other providers we could also avoid duplication of services and increase our overall effectiveness			0
" qualified nurse practitioners might also be able to lighten some of the primary care physicians ' load , as would physician assistants if such practices are allowed			1
but in some states that are already desperate for doctors , such as @entity249 , nurse practitioners must legally practice under the guidance of a physician			2
why your waiter has an md other solutions could include opening more residency slots for doctors			0
@entity77 said he 'd also love to see universities discount tuition for students who studied primary care			1
" i 'd love for them to say to a student , ' i hear you are interested in primary care , ' and present them with a bill with only zeros on it , " he said			1
" and then say to people who were going into a specialty , ' here 's your tuition bill , ' with a number in front of all those zeros			0
" people were worried the health care system would be overwhelmed when @entity194 and @entity15 started in the 1960s too , @entity36 gov. @entity275 told @entity279 chief medical correspondent dr. @entity278 , but the system adapted			2
" i understand there is a sense of worry , and change can be scary , but our present system is broken , " @entity77 said			0
" we pay twice as much for our health in this country and have worse outcomes than other countries			0
" we will have to start coming up with creative solutions to this problem -- ones that wo n't have to wait for an act from @entity295			0

approximately 48 million people are currently uninsured in the @entity11
there is a physician shortage , and experts say more primary care doctors are needed
when @entity142 mandated health insurance for residents , wait times increased
technology , team care may help in handling the *influx* of patients , doctor says
