@entity0 -- on a saturday at the @entity2 , a small cluster of women watch a demonstration of a new product			1
their giggles turn into growing interest			0
they learn the city is handing out free samples , but it 's not shampoo or makeup products			0
instead , the women can leave the salon with free female condoms tucked into their purses			1
co-owner @entity19 said his salon is a perfect place for a frank discussion about safe sex			0
" we talk about beauty and we talk about hair and makeup and things to make them feel better , " @entity19 said			0
" we should start talking about things that are helping them to live longer			0
" faced with an hiv infection rate six times higher than the national average , @entity0 officials are launching an unorthodox campaign to halt the spread of the disease			1
they will hand out 500,000 female condoms at salons and community centers and offer informal training sessions to teach women how to use the little - known product			1
about 30 percent of people infected in @entity0 are women , and the numbers are growing , said @entity47 , senior deputy director of the district 's @entity48			1
@entity32 is particularly prevalent among african - americans , and more black women between 25 and 34 will die from hiv / aids nationwide than from any other cause			1
" women have n't really gotten the message that they 're at risk , " @entity47 said			2
" so we are very , very concerned with making sure that women in the district realize that @entity32 , in fact , is a woman 's disease too			1
" in the past , the higher price of female condoms kept them from reaching the ubiquity of the male condom			1
a newly released version , called @entity66 , is cheaper and designed to be more user - friendly , but the female condom is still relatively unknown			2
so when health officials in @entity0 decided to use a $ 500,000 grant from the @entity72 to distribute female condoms , they allocated a portion for marketing			1
" one of the things about female condoms is that they 're a new product to most people , " @entity47 said			1
" so like any new product , you ca n't expect it just to sell itself , just to take off on its own			2
" the city trained outreach workers to demonstrate female condom use and then sent them into salons and onto college campuses to reach women where they already feel comfortable			1
@entity91 became an outreach worker after she discovered she was @entity32 - positive six years ago			1
now @entity93 has begun giving demonstrations on the female condom			2
she says she 's a convert			0
" it will give a woman a choice , freedom to use protection when a man feels as though that he does n't have to use a condom , " @entity93 said			1
" and it gives her the opportunity to say , ' well you do n't have to use one , so i 'll use one			0
' " she said demonstrators ask women to take home three female condoms in the hopes it will increase their familiarity with the product			1
" try it three times , " @entity93 said			2
" first time , experiment [ with ] it , you feel it , try to apply it			0
second time , apply it again			0
and the third time , use it with your friend			0
and if they 're not convinced by the third time , " then they probably wo n't continue to use it , she said			0
before @entity132 saw a demonstration she was not enthusiastic about using an " unattractive " female condom			2
but after another woman offered tips on female condom use and explained the condoms could prevent sexually transmitted diseases , @entity132 said she would give them a chance			1
" i 'll try it , " @entity132 said			0
" i 'll see if through my own experience i 'll like it			0
" that 's the response that prevention advocates are hoping to hear			0
" @entity32 and @entity147 has declared war on our communities , particularly on @entity153 - @entity152 women			2
and i feel that we are justified as health care providers to look for every single avenue to fight back , " said dr. @entity154 , director of the @entity155 at @entity156			0
" for me the important thing would be that even one women is spared from becoming infected			0
