-- we 've finally emerged from the season in which @entity3 were asked by the pollsters and politicians : " are you better off today than you were four years ago ? " but sometimes it 's important to contemplate the question of progress from a longer view : how are we doing on the scale of a generation ? to answer that question , take this brief quiz			1
over the past two decades , what have the @entity3 trends been for the following important measures of social health : high school dropout rates , college enrollment , juvenile crime , drunken driving , traffic deaths , infant mortality , life expectancy , per capita gasoline consumption , workplace injuries , air pollution , divorce , male - female wage equality , charitable giving , voter turnout , per capita gdp and teen pregnancy ? the answer for all of them is the same : the trend is positive			1
almost all those varied metrics of social wellness have improved by more than 20 % over the past two decades			2
and that 's not counting the myriad small wonders of modern medicine that have improved our quality of life as well as our longevity : the anti-depressants and insulin pumps and quadruple bypasses			2
@entity3 enjoy longer , healthier lives in more stable families and communities than we did 20 years ago			1
but other than the crime trends , these facts are rarely reported or shared via word - of - mouth channels			2
idea of @entity3 exceptionalism a powerful force through history many @entity3 , for instance , are convinced that " half of all marriages end in divorce , " though that has n't been the case since the early 1980s , when divorce rates peaked at just over 50 %			1
since then , they have declined by almost a third			0
this is not merely a story of success in advanced industrial countries			0
the quality - of - life and civic health trends in the developing world are even more dramatic			2
even though the world 's population has doubled over the past 50 years , the percentage living in poverty has declined by 50 % over that period			0
infant mortality and life expectancy have improved by more than 40 % in @entity82 since the early 1990s			1
no country in history has improved its average standard of living faster than @entity87 has over the past two decades			0
of course , not all the arrows point in a positive direction , particularly after the past few years			0
the number of @entity3 living in poverty has increased over the past decade , after a long period of decline			1
wealth inequality has returned to levels last seen in the roaring ' 20s			0
today , the @entity3 unemployment rate is still just under 8 % , higher than its average over the past two decades			1
household debt soared over the past 20 years , though it has dipped slightly thanks to the credit crunch of the last few years			0
and while the story of water and air pollution over that period is a triumphant one , the long - term trends for global warming remain bleak			0
we are much more likely to hear about these negative trends than the positive ones for two primary reasons			1
first , we tend to assume that innovation and progress come from big technology breakthroughs , from new gadgets and communications technologies , most of them created by the private sector			0
but the positive trends in our social health are coming from a more complex network of forces : from government intervention , public service announcements , demographic changes , the shared wisdom of life experiences passed along through generations and the positive effects of rising affluence			1
the emphasis on private sector progress is no accident ; it is the specific outcome of the way public opinion is shaped within the current media landscape			2
opinion : how progress is possible in @entity140 's second term the public sector does n't have billions of dollars to spend on marketing campaigns to trumpet its successes			0
a multinational corporation invents a slightly better detergent , and it will spend a legitimate fortune to alert the world that the product is now " new and improved			0
" but no one takes out a prime - time ad campaign to tout the remarkable decrease in air pollution that we have seen over the past few decades , even thought that success story is far more important than a trivial improvement in laundry soap			2
that blind spot is compounded by the deeper lack of interest in stories of incremental progress			0
curmudgeons , doomsayers , utopians and declinists all have an easier time getting our attention than opinion leaders who want to celebrate slow and steady improvement			1
the most striking example of this can be seen in the second half of the 1990s , a period in which both economic and social trends were decisively upbeat : the stock market was surging , but inequality was in fact on the decline ; crime , drug use , welfare dependence , poverty -- all were trending in an encouraging direction			2
with a @entity186 in the @entity187 , you might assume that the op - ed pages of the @entity189 would be bursting with pride over the state of the nation , given the paper 's center - left leanings			0
but you would be wrong			0
over the course of 1997 , in the middle of the greatest peacetime economic boom in @entity3 history ( and before the monica lewinsky scandal broke ) , 71 % of all editorials published in the @entity189 that expressed an opinion on some aspect of the country 's current state focused on a negative trend			1
less than 5 % of the total number of editorials concentrated on a positive development			0
even the boom years are a bummer			0
i suspect , in the long run , the media bias against incremental progress may be more damaging than any bias the media display toward the political left or right			2
the media are heavily biased toward extreme events , and they are slightly biased toward negative events -- though in their defense , that bias may just be a reflection of the human brain 's propensity to focus more on negative information than positive , a trait extensively documented by neuroscience and psychology studies			1
the one positive social trend that did generate a significant amount of coverage -- the extraordinary drop in the @entity3 crime rate since the mid- ' 90s -- seems to have been roundly ignored by the general public			1
the violent crime rate ( crimes per thousand people ) dropped from 51 to 15 between 1995 and 2010 , truly one of the most inspiring stories of societal progress in our lifetime			1
and yet according to a series of @entity249 polls conducted over the past 10 years , more than two - thirds of @entity3 believe that crime has been getting worse , year after year			1
whether these biases come from media distortions or our human psychology , they result in two fundamental errors in the popular mind : we underestimate the amount of steady progress that continues around us , and we misunderstand where that progress comes from			1
we should celebrate these stories of progress , not so we can rest on our laurels but instead so we can inspire the next generation to build on that success			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity268 .			2

@entity268 : by almost any measure , life in @entity3 is much better than in past generations
dropout rates , college enrollment , crime , infant mortality have shown improvement
despite progress , most people , and the media , focus on negative trends , he says
@entity268 : doomsayers get our attention more *readily* than those pointing to steady progress
