-- @entity2 gov. @entity1 signed into law sunday a bill that prohibits most teenagers from getting bronzed in tanning beds , making the @entity7 the first to do so			1
state sen. @entity8 said he first tried , and failed , in 2007 to make it illegal for people between the ages of 14 and 18 to walk into a facility and use ultraviolet beds to tan			1
four years later , his effort finally paid off			0
" i feel great , " @entity8 told @entity0 of the bill 's passage			2
" i believe it will help save lives and prevent unnecessary suffering			1
" previously , those between 14 and 18 could use tanning beds if they had a parent or legal guardian 's permission			1
that is no longer allowed , though the use of " a phototherapy device ... used by or under the direct supervision of a qualified physician or surgeon " and certain services offered at tanning facilities , like spray tans , are still legal for young people			0
while most states regulate how minors can use tanning facilities , @entity2 's recently enacted restrictions go further than any other state , according to the @entity40			1
some counties also address the issue , with the same organization noting that @entity44 , @entity45 , was the first jurisdiction to ban indoor tanning for all under age 18			2
governments in other countries have taken similar actions , with @entity52 banning tanning beds altogether			1
such steps come after the @entity55 , which is part of the @entity57 , in 2009 classified " uv - emitting tanning devices as ' carcinogenic to humans			1
' " the determination was made after reviews of more than 20 epidemiological studies found that one 's skin cancer risk increases 75 % when a person starts using a tanning device before they turn 30 , the agency noted on its website			2
@entity8 explained that excessive tanning at an early age can be especially perilous because tanning and its negative effects are " cumulative			0
" but he said that one concern is how tanning salons market such services			0
" they often say come in ( and get ) the package deal , where you can tan a lot over a ( relatively ) short period of time and do intense damage , " said the @entity77 from @entity78			0
still , he said that at least in some circles -- including the @entity88 reality show " @entity94 , " where " gym , tanning and laundry " is a way of life -- he believes the message about the danger of tanning beds may be getting through			2
" i know that @entity98 on the ' @entity94 ' has changed to spray tanning , " @entity8 said			0
" spray tanning has no known harmful effects , and you can get tans from lotions or cream			0
there are safe ways to get that brown look			0
