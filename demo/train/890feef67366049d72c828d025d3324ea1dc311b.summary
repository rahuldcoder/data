apparently sexism is n't just a social problem -- if you 're in the path of a hurricane , gender bias might actually kill you			0
a study suggests people prepare differently for hurricanes depending on whether the storm has a male or female name			1
" feminine - named hurricanes ( vs. masculine - named hurricanes ) cause significantly more deaths , apparently because they lead to a lower perceived risk and consequently less preparedness , " a team of researchers wrote in the @entity13			1
in other words , a hurricane named " @entity20 " might not make people flee like a hurricane named " @entity24 " would			2
the study analyzed death rates from @entity28 hurricanes from 1950 to 2012			1
it suggests that changing a severe hurricane 's name from @entity32 to @entity33 could nearly triple its death toll			2
" for severe storms , where taking protective action would have the greatest potential to save lives , the masculinity - femininity of a hurricane 's name predicted its death toll , " the study said			1
@entity43 in 2005 , which left more than 1,800 people dead , was not included in the study because it was considered a statistical outlier			2
neither was @entity48 in 1957 , which killed 416 people			0
the study does note that both of those very deadly hurricanes had female names			1
forecasters : fewer storms in the @entity57 this year ? questioning the data but not everyone buys the team 's hypothesis			0
@entity62 of the @entity63 said the pattern is most likely a statistical fluke , according to @entity66			0
he notes that all hurricanes had female names until 1979 -- meaning the study included 29 years without male hurricane names			1
that 's significant because hurricanes have generally gotten less deadly over time , @entity62 told @entity66			0
" it could be that more people die in female - named hurricanes simply because more people died in hurricanes on average before they started getting male names , " @entity62 said			1
study : experiments back up the claim but the researchers said they did n't just analyze death tolls from actual hurricanes , they also conducted a series of experiments to test their hypothesis			1
in one experiment , participants predicted the intensity of 10 hurricanes -- five with female names and five with male names			1
the male hurricanes were deemed more intense -- regardless of the gender of the participant			2
in another test , participants were asked to judge the risks of a hypothetical " @entity102 " and a " @entity103			2
" despite being told both had uncertain intensity , respondents considered @entity102 to be riskier			0
a third experiment tested whether participants would be more likely to evacuate due to a " @entity109 " vs. a " @entity110			2
" as expected , more people would flee their homes if @entity109 came barreling toward them compared to an impending @entity110			0
why name hurricanes anyway ? giving hurricanes short , easy - to - remember names helps reduce confusion when two or more tropical storms are brewing at the same time , the @entity114 said			1
for decades , all hurricanes were given female names in part because hurricanes were unpredictable , the study said , citing the " @entity124 , @entity125 and @entity126			1
" " this practice came to an end in the late 1970s with increasing societal awareness of sexism , and an alternating male - female naming system was adopted , " the report said			1
each year 's list of hurricane names is alphabetical , alternating between male and female monikers			1
if you 're trying to get your name on the hurricane list , do n't bother			0
a @entity141 @entity140 committee has already set up six years ' worth of names			0
the lists repeat after each six - year cycle			0
" the only time that there is a change is if a storm is so deadly or costly that the future use of its name on a different storm would be inappropriate for obvious reasons of sensitivity , " the @entity114 said			0
this year 's list of names include " @entity158 " and " @entity159			0
" it 's unclear how people might prepare differently if caught in the paths of those storms			0
breaking down the climate report by region fast facts : @entity126 statistics a look at the 2014 @entity57 hurricane season			0

female - named hurricanes cause " significantly more deaths , " a study finds
researchers analyzed over six decades of death rates from @entity28 hurricanes
experiment participants considered hypothetical male storms deadlier than female storms
one *critic* says earlier hurricanes , which were deadlier , were only given female names
