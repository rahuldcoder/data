-- @entity1 could very well become the @entity3 majority leader after tuesday 's midterm elections , but do n't count on @entity5 to make it an easy transition for the @entity9 @entity8			1
@entity5 , a @entity8 senator from @entity10 who 's eying a 2016 presidential bid , all but promised to raise hell next year should his party control the @entity3			2
in an interview with the @entity16 published sunday , @entity5 refused to pledge his support to @entity18 , the current minority leader in the @entity3 , and outlined what he believes should be the chamber 's priorities			1
@entity22 put up brave face ahead of election while @entity5 has campaigned for many mainstream @entity8 candidates this year , his new comments indicate he 's aiming to re-claim the mantle of @entity8 insurgent , a role that helped define his first year in the @entity3 in 2013			2
the first priority next year , he told the @entity16 , should be a string of hearings on president @entity33 , " looking at the abuse of power , the executive abuse , the regulatory abuse , the lawlessness that sadly has pervaded this administration			0
" polls give @entity8 momentum going into midterms he also hopes a @entity8 @entity3 will " pursue every means possible to repeal @entity42 , " just as the @entity8 - controlled @entity43 has tried more than 50 times to dismantle the health care law			1
part of the effort , he said , should include forcing a vote that could avoid a possible filibuster by @entity22			0
if @entity33 vetoes the repeal , the @entity3 should vote on @entity42 provisions " one at a time , " according to the @entity16			1
@entity18 , who 's trying to stave off a high - profile @entity22 challenge in his re-election bid , has largely stayed away from spelling out the would - be @entity8 agenda next year			0
how presidential contenders are spending @entity58 @entity5 's comments also set the stage for an interesting dynamic between himself and sen. @entity62 of @entity9 , a potential 2016 rival			0
unlike @entity5 , @entity62 has stood closely by @entity18 's side in the senior senator 's re-election campaign -- an alliance that could surely benefit @entity62 , who 's eager to get his own series of bills passed in the run - up to a presidential bid .			0

@entity5 refused to pledge his support to @entity1 if he becomes @entity3 majority leader
