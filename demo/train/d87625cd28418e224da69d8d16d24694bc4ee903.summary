-- cycling is a sport with a dark doping past but the way it has cleaned up its act is a model for athletics to follow , says olympic gold medallist @entity8			1
the retired @entity10 sprinter called for change after track stars @entity13 of the @entity14 and @entity16 's @entity15 both tested positive for banned substances			1
the legacy of doping still hangs over cycling and @entity22 leader @entity21 has frequently had to answer questions over his performance during this year 's race in the wake of @entity28 's fall from grace			2
but @entity8 , who won 4 x 100 meter gold at @entity30 , suggests the way the sport has clawed back its credibility is a lesson to the track and field community			1
" @entity36 needs to have a look at cycling and see how they handled the @entity28 situation and how over time people started to believe in the sport again , " @entity8 , who won 4 x 100 meter gold at @entity30 , told @entity0			1
" but this ca n't go on , eventually it will destroy the sport and it will mean younger fans decide they do n't want to watch athletics anymore , and that would be disastrous			0
" everyone has come out and said ' enough is enough			0
' we are nearly at breaking point			0
if we do n't do anything it will be broken forever			0
" @entity8 , who also clinched silver over 200 meters at @entity52 , has long been a supporter of lifetime bans for athletes who chose to take banned substances , a sanction currently not allowed under the @entity58 's ( @entity58 ) code			1
but , while he is steadfastly opposed to the use of performance - enhancing substances , @entity8 is wary of punishing those who inadvertently break the rules			1
he is concerned that athletes who unknowingly take banned substances contained within nutritional supplements could be sanctioned unjustly			1
he compares the situation with @entity10 's ' horse meat scandal ' in which some foods advertised as beef were found to contain horse meat			1
" how many people knew they were eating horse ? " added @entity8			2
" i think that 's why we should n't just say ' ok , they 're drugs cheats ' and just forget about it			1
" imagine if they 're innocent ? innocent in the sense that they did n't knowingly take it			0
" " i run a sports nutrition company			0
as an athlete myself , there was no way for professional athletes to take nutrition products with the safety of knowing there 's not going to be cross contamination			0
" i 'm an advocate for lifetime bans , but i would n't want to see someone banned for life who had n't knowingly done it			1
" news of positive tests for both @entity13 and @entity15 comes just weeks after @entity16 triple olympic gold medalist @entity95 was also provisionally suspended			1
@entity8 is pleased to see anti-doping authorities clamping down on athletes regardless of their stature			2
" there is n't a case that high - profile athletes get a different level of treatment to anybody else , " added @entity8			2
" if they are caught doping it will be highlighted and everybody will hear about it			0
" in that respect it 's definitely the way forward			0
i still feel that governing bodies need to get to the point where the deterrent is so big and so powerful that it stops people from deciding to take performance - enhancing drugs			0
" on sunday , former world champion @entity13 said he was told by the @entity116 that an a sample from an out of competition test taken in may had come back positive			2
@entity13 did n't name the substance found in his system and added that he never knowingly took performance - enhancing drugs			2
he has pulled out of next month 's world championships in @entity124			0
@entity15 , a former world - record holder from @entity16 , said he was caught for using the banned stimulant oxilofrine -- often found in dietary supplements -- that showed up in a test at last month 's @entity16 trials			1
" i do n't have a sabotage story , " @entity13 was quoted as saying by @entity130			0
" i basically put my trust in someone and was let down			0
