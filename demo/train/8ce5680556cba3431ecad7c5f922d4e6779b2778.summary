-- the man who collected the urine sample that led to @entity5 outfielder @entity4 's now - overturned drug suspension says he did not tamper with the sample , as @entity4 has implied			1
" i followed the same procedure in collecting mr. @entity4 's sample as i did in the hundreds of other samples , " @entity7 said in a statement released tuesday			1
" at no point did i tamper in any way with the samples			1
this situation has caused great emotional distress for me and my family			0
" @entity7 's statement comes after @entity4 publicly blasted @entity19 's drug testing system and an arbitration board tossed out a 50 - game suspension imposed as the result of the drug test @entity4 took last year			1
@entity4 , the 2011 @entity24 , told reporters that nearly two days passed between when a collector took his sample and when it was delivered to a @entity29 office			1
" what could have possibly happened to it during that 44 - hour period ? there were a lot of things that we learned about the collector , about the collection process , about the way that the entire thing worked that made us very concerned and very suspicious about what could have actually happened , " @entity4 said during a news conference last week			1
@entity7 said he collected urine samples from @entity4 along with two other players on october 1 , a saturday , and the samples were sealed , placed in a sealed bag and then placed into a sealed cardboard box			1
he finished the collection at 5 p.m. and took the samples home because there was " no @entity29 office located within 50 miles of @entity51 that would ship packages that day or sunday			1
" @entity7 said the testing policy requires collectors to take samples to their homes until @entity29 can immediately send the sample to the laboratory			2
he said the sample was stored in his basement office in areas sufficiently cool enough to store urine			0
he then shipped the sample on monday , october 3			0
" it is my understanding that the samples were received at the laboratory with all tamper resistant seals intact , " @entity7 said			2
the arbitrator 's decision last week to overturn @entity4 's suspension marked the first successful appeal of a suspension under @entity19 's anti-drug policy			1
@entity4 , 28 , led the @entity5 to the team 's first division title in three decades in 2011 , with a .332 batting average , 33 home runs and 111 runs batted in			2
he was slapped with the suspension in december after the drug test , which the sports network @entity83 , citing unidentified sources , said showed high levels of testosterone			0
@entity4 said at the time there were " highly unusual circumstances " that would show his innocence			2
the arbitration panel apparently agreed , voting 2 - 1 to overturn the suspension , according to the @entity92			0
@entity19 's executive vice president for labor relations , @entity93 , roundly rejected @entity4 's accusations , though he said some changes may be made in the testing process			0
" @entity19 runs the highest quality drug testing program of any professional sports organization in the world			0
... our program is not ' fatally flawed			0
' changes will be made promptly to clarify the instructions provided to collectors regarding when samples should be delivered to @entity29 based on the arbitrator 's decision , " he wrote in a statement released last week			0
@entity0 's @entity111 and @entity112 contributed to this report			0

" at no point did i tamper in any way with the samples , " the collector says
the collector *waited* nearly two days to deliver his sample , @entity4 says
his 50 - games suspension has been tossed out
