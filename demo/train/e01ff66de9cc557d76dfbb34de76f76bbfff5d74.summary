-- @entity2 's recent bankruptcy draws attention to a festering problem in @entity5 -- many of our cities are in trouble			1
according to @entity12 's , more than half of the 50 largest @entity5 cities have expenses and liabilities that overwhelm their tax revenues -- the same fiscal stress that bankrupted @entity2			1
the average poverty rate in the poorest half of our 50 largest cities is now nearly 26 % , up from just over 21 % in 2000			1
smaller cities are also struggling			2
@entity23 , where we are from , has five cities with a population between 100,000 and 150,000			2
three of those five have poverty rates above 25 % , despite the state 's overall wealth			2
@entity33 , once the wealthiest city in the country in 1870 , is now one of the poorest , with a poverty rate of 38 %			1
cities develop as centers of trade , industry , government or learning that create opportunity and prosperity as their population and economy expand			1
but if the economic forces driving that expansion go away , a city 's tax base can disappear while the costs of its infrastructure and a concentrated population remain			2
these cities end up with a lot of bills and no one to pay them			2
their residents , who experience the @entity60 when the city is growing , experience the @entity62 when things turn down -- no job opportunity , underperforming schools , deteriorating housing stock , high crime rates and overextended social services			1
the market forces that make and break cities are powerful and probably can not -- and should not -- be controlled			2
forcing the car industry to remain in @entity2 would not have been the answer to @entity2 's problems			1
but market forces can be coaxed , and smart policy and good leadership make a difference			0
@entity78 , a city that arose around steel as @entity2 did around cars , has been repurposed			1
with steel largely gone , @entity78 remains a smaller but thriving and financially healthy city with 125,000 net new jobs since 1990 and an unemployment rate below the national rate			1
@entity78 's recovery was helped by good policy that included eliminating regulatory impediments to redevelopment of old industrial sites , replacing abandoned factories on the city 's riverfront with a 13 - mile continuous loop of parks and supporting some of the country 's earliest small - business incubators			1
@entity98 , a city developed around the defense industry , lost tens of thousands of jobs when the @entity101 ended			1
as jobs left , crime rates rose to record highs , and the city faced a @entity2 - like downward spiral			1
but good crime - fighting policies , including community policing and the early adoption of new forensic technologies , resulted in violent crime dropping from over nine crimes per thousand residents in 1993 to under four by 2011			0
the @entity113 recently published its @entity114 , a compendium of policy recommendations for preserving jobs , improving schools and housing , and reducing crime in struggling cities based on successful strategies from around the country			2
in addition to the strategies that worked in @entity78 and @entity98 , these recommendations include education reform initiatives such as public school choice and " money follows the child " approach to school funding , where dollars for charter and magnet schools go directly to those schools , rather than shared with the student 's school district overall			1
they also include crime reduction initiatives such as reducing recidivism with swift , certain and short punishment for probation violators and housing initiatives such as reforming the low - income tax credit so that it does n't force low - income families to remain in distressed neighborhoods			0
the " money follows the child " concept of school funding helped @entity149 nearly double the number of students scoring " proficient " or " advanced " on the @entity152 from 2002 to 2008			0
@entity154 's @entity153 , which immediately jails any probation or parole violator for up to four days , led to a 55 % decline in recidivism and a 72 % decline in parolee / probationer drug use from 2004 to 2010			0
without smart policy and strong leadership to counter the weakening of a city 's economic foundation , its residents endure very real human suffering and displacement			0
fairness and opportunity for everyone are essential premises and promises of @entity5			1
both can disappear in a decaying city			0
there was a heavy focus on urban problems in the 1960s and 1970s			0
booming economies -- beginning in the 1980s and continuing through 2007 -- reduced and masked those problems , but most were not fixed			0
political dialogue now emphasizes the needs of the " middle class " and " working families " rather than the urban poor			0
it is time to re-engage in an effort to help our most challenged citizens and ensure that fairness and opportunity extend to everyone			0
the impact of our declining cities is the most compelling equity issue today			0
let 's add fixing struggling cities to the national agenda			0
join us on @entity201 / @entity200 .			0

@entity203 and @entity204 are *concerned* that @entity5 cities big and small are failing to keep up with change

@entity2 , @entity33 , @entity98 and @entity78 have different problems with different solutions
