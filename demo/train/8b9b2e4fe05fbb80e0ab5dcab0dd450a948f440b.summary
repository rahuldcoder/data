yet 10 years after his death , he 's survived by the internal frustration and outward animosity that 's long defined relations among and between @entity6 and @entity7			1
so , too , has the violence that 's marred the region for decades			0
recent incidents have stirred fears in @entity6 of a return to 2002 , then in the midst of a second intifada , or armed uprising , when the @entity6 government reported 452 people died in suicide bombings and other attacks			1
@entity20 cancels @entity0 memorials after bombings , blames @entity23 on one day alone last week , an @entity6 soldier was stabbed to death on a @entity27 street while three @entity6 were stabbed -- one fatally -- at the same @entity29 hitchhiking post where three @entity6 teens were kidnapped earlier this year			1
this came after several incidents in which drivers ran into crowds on busy streets , and before tuesday , when two knife - and axe - wielding @entity7 cousins killed four @entity6 worshipping at a @entity38 synagogue			1
so does this all mean a third intifada is coming , if it 's not already here ? no -- or , at least , not yet , according to experts			0
much has changed , they point out , since @entity0 's death			0
it 's harder than ever to get from the @entity29 into @entity6 , especially with explosives and such			1
there has been no call to arms by the @entity7 leadership in the @entity29 ; instead , analysts say , there has been significant cooperation with @entity6 authorities to ferret out potential attackers			1
and there have n't been anything close yet to the coordinated , large - scale attacks in @entity6 like those of the early 2000s			1
as retired former @entity6 national security adviser maj. gen. @entity57 pointed out last week , what 's happening now " falls far from " the first two intifadas , as far as the overall threat to @entity6			1
but one thing that has n't changed is the deep frustration among @entity7			1
now , as was the case over a decade ago , many still harbor steep distrust at @entity6 authorities and diminishing hopes for a political breakthrough			1
" the nature of these movements is that spark could ignite the tinder , " said @entity68 , the head of the @entity71 ' @entity70 program			0
" ... and once it starts moving , you have no idea where it 's going to go			0
" @entity6 troop kill @entity7 man in @entity29 clashes voids in @entity7 hope , leadership @entity0 is still considered a hero among many @entity7 , as the scenes around the @entity29 commemorating his death last tuesday showed			1
this was a man , according to his supporters , who stood up to @entity6			1
this was a man who rallied @entity7 to fight			1
this was a man who got leaders around the world to buy into the idea of an independent @entity7 state			1
not only is there no more @entity0 , but the idea of a unified @entity7 front is a thing of the past as well			2
@entity0 's former group , @entity20 , now controls the @entity29 under @entity106 president @entity105 , while rival @entity23 is in charge of @entity109			0
" you have an unprecedented division , " said the @entity111 's @entity110 , contrasting that to what he views as @entity6 leadership that 's become more conservative and less willing to compromise			2
" it 's a much weaker leadership than we 've ever seen			0
" the lack of a unifying figure , like @entity0 , has led to a " complete alienation of the people from leadership , " said @entity124 of the @entity125 in @entity38			0
not only do n't they have a person to rally around , there 's no clear sense of a workable exit strategy that will end the cycle that makes life difficult for many @entity7			1
" people really have no expectation , no hope , no perspective in terms of their being any chance that comes through a political initiative , " @entity124 told @entity1 from her home in @entity134			0
" so what we have is an outburst of frustration			0
" what there is not , however , is any clear organization in the recent efforts to lash out against @entity6 -- which was unlike , many say , happened during the second intifada			2
in some ways , that may be more frightening -- because instead of dealing with a known threat or plot you can unravel , only the attacker may know what will happen next			0
" this is a huge problem because there is no intelligence , " @entity57 told reporters on a call coordinated by the @entity160			0
" someone is getting up in the morning or going out of the mosque at noon and saying , ' today , i 'll kill some @entity6			2
' " there is no organization behind it , " the former @entity6 national security adviser said , noting that all someone has to do is take a knife from their kitchen and attack			1
" ... i do n't see any measures that can be taken to stop an individual ( like that )			2
" 2 killed , 2 wounded in stabbing attacks on @entity6 @entity6 policies have an impact what 's happening and what 's not happening , if you 're talking about major attacks , is a testament to @entity6 's policies as well			2
a lot has changed since what @entity6 called the " @entity189 massacre , " when a man walked into a seaside hotel in spring 2002 and blew himself up , killing 30 civilians			2
for one , a wall -- or a fence , depending on where you are along the border -- has been erected between the @entity29 and @entity6 , making it harder for anyone intent on attacking to cross over with explosives or weapons			2
also , @entity6 has a renowned intelligence apparatus that 's had years of practice in rooting out potential attackers			2
this is on top of other policies , like stringent measures restricting citizens ' ownership of firearms			0
and even as they push for independence , @entity6 authorities also have found a working security partner in the @entity106			1
behind the scenes , the two sides have coordinated efforts to preemptively go after those who might carry out attacks , not to mention common foes from @entity23			0
" the two have worked together , and it has prevented many terror attacks inside @entity6 , " said the @entity160 's @entity220 , predicting both sides will continue to coordinate even if they are publicly at odds			2
" and it has also brought much more calm			0
" yet as clashes in the @entity29 last tuesday showed , it sometimes does n't take much for things to turn violent and get out of hand			0
and @entity7 do n't live only there and in @entity109			1
many live in @entity6 , including some 300,000 in @entity38 , where there has been recent unrest centered around what @entity235 know as the @entity237 and @entity238 as the @entity237			1
" the fear for @entity6 is that the new terrorists ( will be ) on this side of the fence , " said @entity220			2
violence , bad feelings never went away even then , discontent among so - called @entity245 is not a new thing either			0
in fact , experts say -- from a security situation -- @entity6 appears safer from prospective terrorist attacks than it was 10 to 15 years ago			1
the measures it 's instituted in that time have made it harder for armed attackers to get across its borders and inflict mass violence			2
but according to @entity124 , @entity7 ' frustrations " have become worse and worse over time for a lot of reasons			2
" she says that many feel that @entity6 -- whether through increased settlement activity or clamping down on borders and what she calls collective punishment following attacks -- are putting up obstacle after obstacle in their quest for " normal lives			0
" " people want to take care of their families , get their kids to school , have enough income to live off of , " she said			0
" and then the pressure just builds up			0
that 's why we have these repeated eruptions of anger and frustration			0
" @entity110 , from @entity111 , said more forceful responses by @entity6 to attacks can backfire , reasoning , " when you respond to violence with more repression , you 're going to get more violence			1
" the " primitive assault tactics " now being used against @entity6 -- knives and cars , rather than rockets and bombs -- could help further the @entity7 ' storyline , especially if @entity6 security forces respond " with a heavy hand " as prime minister @entity298 said after tuesday 's synagogue attack , expert @entity290 said			1
" ( such tactics ) help portray the perpetrators ... as people of desperation ; they can claim ' we do n't have better means of disposal , ' " said @entity290 , from the @entity6 - based @entity308			1
" it 's an asymmetric battle militarily of a weaker party against a stronger party			0
" it 's the lack of an end game -- a result that will bring peace , security and happiness to both @entity6 and @entity7 -- that has some especially worried			1
if there 's no political end in sight , what 's to prevent those frustrations from continuing to build ? " it 's probably not going to get a lot worse , and it 's almost certainly not going to get a lot better , " said @entity323 , the director of the @entity325 's @entity324			0
" the best you can say , on both sides , is , ' well , at least we 're not like @entity332 and @entity333			0
" @entity1 's @entity334 contributed to this report .			0
