-- he became the youngest player in @entity4 golf history after teeing off at the @entity6 and @entity7 's record - breaking round was below par -- but not in a good way			1
the 13 - year - old struggled as he joined the big boys at golf 's top table , ending his opening round on five - over - par to sit 149th in a field of 156			1
@entity7 , from @entity16 , endured a nervous start to his historic round as he joined the likes of @entity21 @entity20 , who finished seventh at this month 's masters , competing for the $ 3.1 million tournament prize fund			1
he made three bogeys and one double bogey in his first six holes and ended the day 12 shots behind leader @entity29 , from @entity21			1
but despite @entity7 's baptism of fire , playing partner @entity31 , who ended the day two shots off @entity29 , said the schoolboy has a bright future ahead of him			1
" i could n't believe i was playing with a 13 - year - old -- i am old enough to be his dad , " @entity36 told the @entity4 's website			1
" it 's pretty scary actually -- i thought i was still quite young			2
" he was very impressive for someone who is 13 and a half years old			0
he hits it long off the tee and hits a lot of very good shots			2
" his putting is good and he has good routines			0
you can see he is very competitive too which you need to be			0
if he keeps on the path he is on then he can be a great player			0
" to be that age and be able to play at this level is amazing			0
i felt lucky to be out there with him because if he keeps going he will be in the top ten in the world pretty comfortably			0
" he is very mature , very driven but he is not being pushed into by his parents -- he wants to go out there and play and improve and that is the main thing			0
" a lot of kids get pushed into things but that is not the case here			0
he really wants it and it is pretty cool to see that in someone so young			0
" after shedding his early nerves , @entity7 was more consistent in the second half of his round and shot level par on the back nine			2
but despite his indifferent start , there 's no taking away @entity7 's title as the youngest player at a @entity4 event -- breaking the record set by by @entity79 's @entity78 -- who was 103 days older when he played at the 2003 @entity80			1
the youngster now faces an uphill battle to fulfill his dream of becoming the youngest player to make the halfway cut and give himself a chance to qualify for the second major of the golf calendar -- the @entity89 in june			1
if successful , he would break the record set by compatriot @entity91 who was 14 years and 304 days old when he played at the 2008 @entity80			0
@entity7 will have his work cut out if he is to catch 25 - year - old @entity29 at the top of the leaderboard , after his bogey - free opening round			1
although a rookie on the @entity4 , the @entity21 showed no signs of inexperience as he carded seven birdies at @entity101 in @entity102			2
there is a six - way tie for second a shot behind @entity29 -- with his compatriot @entity106 , @entity107 @entity106 , @entity106 of @entity108 , @entity106 from @entity109 , @entity111 @entity110 and @entity113 @entity112 all hot on his heels			2
@entity20 finished on one - under - par while former top ten player @entity115 , also from @entity21 , was on four - under .			1

@entity7 is youngest player in @entity4 history , teeing off at @entity118
the @entity16 schoolboy fails to keep up with elite field , finishing opening day *eighth* - last
youngster is 12 shots behind leader @entity29 who is on seven - under - par
*performance* casts *shadow* over @entity7 's hopes to make cut and qualify for @entity89 in june
