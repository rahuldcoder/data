-- it 's a condition practically unheard of in the @entity2 and most western countries			0
but in a culture where a woman 's status and dignity is decided by her ability to provide a husband with multiple children , it can be a fate worse than death			0
" obstetric fistula " is a mouthful			1
but to these women , it 's much more than just a physical injury			2
they see themselves as the walking dead , says dr. @entity22 , head of the department of obstetrics and gynecology at @entity27 in @entity28 , @entity29			1
an obstetric fistula occurs when a woman withstands days of obstructed labor , when a baby 's head is constantly pushing against her pelvic bone during contractions -- preventing blood flow and causing tissue to die			1
this creates a hole , or a " fistula , " between a woman 's vagina and her bladder or rectum			2
her baby is unlikely to survive			0
if the mother lives , she is unable to hold her urine and , in some cases , bowel content , @entity22 says			0
a woman with a fistula , who is perpetually leaking urine and sometimes feces , is often rejected by her husband and shunned by her village because of her foul smell and inability to bear more children			2
" these women have so much shame and so much fear			2
they spend so much money on perfume trying to cover up the smell , " says @entity63 , a doctorate student at @entity64 in @entity65 who is leading a research study of 50 women in @entity68 awaiting fistula surgery			1
the women range in age from 15 to 70			2
@entity76 women find hope in corrective surgery an estimated 20 % of @entity80 's fistula patients report feeling ostracized by their communities , and divorce is common , says the doctor , who started his residency in 2001 at @entity27 , a 155 - bed tertiary hospital with a fistula repair unit			1
" people think fistula patients are witches and just have bad luck , " he says			2
although an estimated 2 million women in @entity93 and @entity94 live with untreated obstetric fistula , according to the @entity96 , it 's unlikely for these women to meet or hear of anyone else suffering from the same injuries , because of the lack of modern forms of communication and also the women 's reluctance to discuss the condition , @entity63 says			1
in most cases , a woman with a fistula does n't know what a fistula is or that it 's treatable with surgery			1
and if she does , she is far from any hospital and does n't have money for -- or access to -- transportation , let alone the average $ 450 cost for repair surgery plus postoperative care			1
one of the youngest in @entity63 's study , a 15 - year - old girl who was married off to her uncle at age 8 , spent eight months selling bags of candied peanuts in order to raise enough money to pay for a taxi so she could get to a fistula center			1
such concerns are foreign concepts to most westerners , says dr. @entity133 , a professor of obstetrics and anthropology at @entity64 in @entity65			0
that 's because obstetric fistulas were largely eradicated from the @entity2 by the 20th century , with strides in prenatal care and the use of cesarean section			1
but pregnancy complications and childbirth are among the leading causes of death and disability for @entity148 women , @entity133 says			1
@entity150 's death inspires doctor 's life work typical @entity148 hospitals do not have the trained staff or resources to identify and treat fistulas , @entity63 says			1
" @entity164 , " one 32 - year - old woman in @entity63 's study , contracted a fistula in her ninth pregnancy and has had three previous surgeries , all of which have failed			1
during the latest pregnancy , she was in labor for several days at home in a rural village before receiving medical care			0
like many @entity148 women , she was malnourished and her pelvic bones were too small for a natural birth			1
after hours of unsuccessful labor and not knowing how to perform a cesarean , the doctors used a scalpel to sever the baby inside the woman 's birth passage			0
over the next few days , the mother delivered her baby , piece by piece , @entity63 says			0
another @entity148 woman in @entity63 's study , " @entity184 , " also has a severe fistula but only leaks when she sits down			1
after the seated interview with @entity63 , @entity184 apologized , saying she would leak urine once she stood up			0
" it was as if a gallon of water was thrown to the ground , " @entity63 says			0
" she was so ashamed			0
" many @entity192 -- both educated and uneducated -- believe there is no cure for fistulas , @entity22 says			0
when he was in medical school at the @entity199 , he says , " they used to tell us not to even try to fix them			0
" but , he says , that 's not the case			0
fistulas can be repaired with delicate surgery , which has a fairly good success rate			1
however , surgeons must be well - trained in the principles of the operation , and good follow - up care is essential so the surgery wo n't fail			1
patients with more severe fistulas may need multiple surgeries			0
too many mothers still dying although he is a full - time professor , @entity133 last year opened the @entity214 in @entity68 , a 42 - bed hospital specializing in fistula repair surgeries with an operating room , outpatient clinic and hostel facilities for about 100 women			1
since opening the fistula center , @entity133 estimates the facility has taken on 50 fistula cases per month			0
but it 's very difficult to get trained staff to run a fistula hospital , because of the lack of available education in @entity27 , he says			1
fistula centers rely on donations and can not afford to hire @entity2 gynecologic surgeons			0
but even they are n't ideal candidates for the job -- since they never see fistula in their own country , they have no experience with it , he says			0
it 's best to have the institution run by locals trained specifically in fistula repair surgery and care			1
those who want to help should focus on spreading the word -- awareness is key , he says			0
thursday is the first @entity248 to end @entity249 ; the @entity250 will host a variety of events to raise awareness			1
that 's true for @entity256 resident @entity255			0
she had never heard of obstetric fistula until she read a book featuring a detailed story of an @entity148 woman with the condition			1
@entity255 was shocked at how affordable fistula repair surgery is , by @entity264 standards			2
@entity255 started a fundraiser called " one week to @entity266 , " which raises money for repair surgeries for underprivileged women who otherwise lack access			2
she asks that participants practice yoga daily for a week and raise enough money for one woman to have fistula repair surgery			2
" i 'm not a runner			0
so it 's something that just came naturally to me , " @entity255 says			0
so far , participants have raised about $ 2,250 , or enough to fund five surgeries			0
@entity255 , who is in the process of making the fundraiser a nonprofit organization , says she hopes to help women who have already developed fistula , while the bigger organizations tackle other issues such as poverty , maternal health and human rights			2
ultimately , she says , fistula is not just a women 's issue ; it 's a human issue .			2

*african* women with obstetric fistula see themselves as the walking dead , doctor says
fistula can be repaired with delicate surgery and follow - up care
many @entity148 hospitals and doctors lack education and *expertise*
