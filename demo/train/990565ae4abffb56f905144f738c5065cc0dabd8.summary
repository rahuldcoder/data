-- artist @entity1 walked on stage at the @entity4 conference in july wearing a body - hugging black and white suit she jokingly called " ninja pajamas			1
" she realized the subject she wanted to talk about was unusual : " all right , so for some of you , this may be really , really out there , " she told the audience in @entity14 , @entity15			0
when people laughed , she added , " just a little			0
" in reality , her @entity17 is not a laughing matter			0
the " ninja pajamas " are intended to serve as a " mushroom death suit , " a medium embedded with mushroom spores that would speed the decomposition of the human body after death			1
@entity1 's project starts with the observation that the human body harbors toxic chemicals that could contribute to pollution through burial or cremation			1
she points out that a study found the chemical @entity36 in 93 % of people aged six and older			0
the @entity39 tracks 219 environmental chemicals in human bodies , including , she said , " preservatives , pesticides and heavy metals like lead and mercury			1
" the lessons ? one is " do n't become a cannibal			0
" more seriously , she said , burial can spread toxins present in the body , and can further harm the environment through cosmetics and other chemicals used to prepare corpses for funerals			1
" @entity60 or natural burials , which do n't use embalming , are a step in the right direction , but they do n't address the existing toxins in our bodies , " she said			2
" i think there 's a better solution			0
" @entity4 : six ways mushrooms can save the world @entity1 , a 2011 @entity71 , studied at @entity72 and @entity73 , and her work has been exhibited in the @entity76 and @entity77			1
before taking on the burial project , she led the @entity80 , which studied the trailers used by the federal disaster agency in the wake of @entity84 and @entity85			2
her team turned a surplus @entity88 trailer , which they dubbed the @entity89 , into an environmental demonstration project for composting , water recycling and other " green " activities			0
@entity4 : @entity94 gives a plant 's - eye view @entity1 is experimenting with collecting her own hair , skin and nails and using them to help feed a variety of edible mushrooms			1
" as the mushrooms grow , i pick the best feeders to become @entity106			0
it 's a kind of imprinting and selective breeding process for the afterlife			2
so when i die , the @entity106 will recognize my body and be able to eat it			2
" " i realize this is not the kind of relationship that we usually aspire to have with our food , " @entity1 said			1
" we want to eat , not be eaten by , our food			0
but as i watch the mushrooms grow and digest my body , i imagine the @entity119 as a symbol of a new way of thinking about death and the relationship between my body and the environment			1
... " it 's a step towards accepting the fact that someday i will die and decay			2
it 's also a step towards taking responsibility for my own burden on the planet			0
... " and the saying goes , we came from dust and will return to dust			0
and once we understand that we 're connected to the environment , we see that the survival of our species depends on the survival of the planet			1

artist @entity1 is developing an environmentally *sustainable* burial method
she says human body contains toxins that pollute the environment after death
@entity1 says a burial suit embedded with mushroom spores would speed decomposition
she sees the process as a way of accepting death and our connection to the planet
