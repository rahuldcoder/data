eager to highlight signs of an economy on the rebound , president @entity0 launched a midterm election effort thursday designed to convince voters of a vigorous recovery that a majority still doubts			1
at stake : the power to get anything done in @entity12 during the final quarter of his presidency			0
" i want people the know there are some really good things happening in @entity23 , " @entity0 declared at @entity17 's @entity16 in @entity18 , both summarizing his election - year pitch and capturing the political problem inherent in having to describe an economic recovery that many @entity23 still are n't feeling			1
" sometimes the noise clutters and i think confuses the nature of the reality out there , " he said before listing his economic achievements , including bailing out the @entity23 automobile sector and reducing the rolls of people without health insurance			1
and despite his assertion that thursday 's remarks did n't amount to a " political speech , " @entity0 took sharp aim at @entity39 who have blocked his economic agenda on @entity42			1
" a true opposition party should have the courage to lay out their agenda , " he said , slamming @entity39 efforts to cut taxes for top earners			0
" nearly all the gains of the recovery have gone to the top 1 % , so i find that a little hard to swallow , " he said , in one stroke jabbing republicans while highlighting the problems he faces in selling an economic recovery that millions of @entity23 have yet to feel			1
although @entity0 can cite statistics that show a renewed @entity23 economy , many @entity23 are still feeling battered by the downturn 's legacy : stagnant wages and not enough full - time work			1
in a @entity64 / @entity63 survey released thursday , 57 % of those polled said the nation 's economy was poor , compared with 42 % who described conditions as good			0
while still underwater , those numbers reflect an improvement in the economic mood of the nation			0
a year ago , only 29 % of @entity23 thought the economy was good , and polls taken between then and now show a steady rise in the number of people who are feeling better about the country 's economic state			1
the question is whether @entity0 gets any credit : a @entity64 / @entity63 poll conducted in late september showed that 56 % of respondents did n't approve of how the president is handling the economy			2
key @entity87 races to watch part of his challenge is explaining why the economic recovery has been so good to the coastal rich while leaving poor and middle - class @entity23 struggling			2
the poll released thursday showed @entity23 who earn north of $ 100,000 per year , and those living in the @entity96 and @entity97 , far more likely to describe economic conditions as good			2
" our broader economy in the aggregate has come a long way , but the gains of recovery are n't yet broadly shared or at least not broadly shared enough , " @entity0 said thursday			2
" the stress that families feel -- that 's real			0
it 's still harder than it should be to pay the bills and put away some money			0
even when you 're working your tail off , it 's harder than it should be to get ahead			0
" as long as @entity23 keep citing the economy as their top issue , as they did by a wide margin in @entity64 's latest survey , the @entity115 will attempt to drive home the message that things are a lot better than they were six years ago			1
" most people this fall are going to vote on economic issues , " said @entity124 , @entity0 's former press secretary , now a @entity64 contributor			0
" like they often do , except in those circumstances like post- 9/11 where they perceive an existential threat to the @entity23			0
" with a little more than a month to go before november 's vote , @entity0 has spent the bulk of his political energy delivering the economic message to @entity136 donors at high - dollar fundraisers			1
he has yet to make an appearance at a campaign rally for a @entity136 , though he 's expected to appear with candidates as @entity141 nears .			0

@entity0 says economy is doing better despite *remaining* hardships
in speech in @entity147 , he slams republicans for blocking agenda
a majority of @entity23 still *disapprove* of how @entity0 has handled economy
@entity136 hope to win midterm voters with their economic message
