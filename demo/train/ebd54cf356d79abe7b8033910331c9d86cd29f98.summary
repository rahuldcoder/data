@entity0 -- the @entity2 hopes it can do a better job of preventing mental health problems in the ranks with more aggressive screening of troops -- before they ship out to a war zone			1
after nine years of fighting in @entity11 and @entity12 , the military is coping with a wave of mental health issues , from post-traumatic stress disorder to depression and suicide			2
@entity2 medical experts have been studying the results of a just - released study of the benefits of pre-deployment evaluation of soldiers and follow - up treatment while they were in @entity12			1
the study found that improved screening reduced later behavioral problems by 78 % and reduced thoughts of suicide by more than half			1
the service is struggling with a troubling suicide rate			2
at a news conference at the @entity35 later wednesday , officials will report that while the number of suicides in the active - duty force declined in 2010 , the number of suicides in the @entity38 and @entity39 increased , a senior @entity2 official said			1
the army surgeon general 's office said tuesday it hopes to have new screening and treatment procedures in place in six months			0
the changes will be based in part on the research published by the @entity51 tuesday			0
" the most important part about the study , even more than the screening , is that they identified which soldiers could benefit from follow - up treatment in - theater , " col. @entity52 told @entity1			1
@entity60 is the director of behavioral health for the surgeon general of the army			0
" that 's important for the mission and it is important for individual soldiers , to see the fight through			0
" the increase in @entity38 and @entity39 suicides is among troops who are in the @entity71 and not activated for duty			0
the senior @entity2 official said more than half of those troops were never deployed to a war zone			1
researchers looked at more than 21,000 soldiers bound for @entity12 in 2007 and 2008			0
roughly half were evaluated before they deployed and were provided with follow - up visits and care when they arrived in @entity12			0
the study concluded that this evaluation -- before , during and after the stresses of a combat -- pays off in fewer problems			1
" this predeployment screening process was associated with a decreased need for clinical care for combat stress , psychiatric and behavioral disorders , and suicidal ideation , " the report said			2
suicidal ideation is the planning of suicide or other suicidal thoughts			2
the authors said the study provided the first direct evidence to support pre-deployment mental health screening across the @entity2			1
" soldiers in screened brigades had significantly lower rates than those in unscreened brigades for clinical contacts for suicidal ideation , combat stress , and psychiatric disorders , as well as lower rates of occupational impairment , " they said			2
in the pilot study that was the basis for the research , some soldiers were not cleared to deploy , others required additional treatment before they deployed and others received follow - up visits at their bases in @entity12			2
and the study found that both the individual soldier and the unit stood to gain from the increased care , as medical problems , emergency treatment and evacuations were reduced			1
" these results show that an aggressive program of mental health screening , tracking , and coordination of care may enhance a unit 's functioning while decreasing negative soldier outcomes , " the study said			1
@entity60 said that an additional benefit of enhanced screening would be reducing the stigma that hinders some military personnel from seeking mental health assistance until their condition worsens			0
the @entity51 is not the only professional publication to focus on mental health problems in the military			0
a special edition of the journal @entity147 also examines how to improve the psychological readiness of @entity71 military personnel			0
" like our physical fitness program , i believe that psychological resilience development can become not just something we in the @entity2 ' do , ' but rather a critical component of our culture that will be integrated throughout our community to develop better soldiers , " gen. @entity150 , the @entity2 's chief of staff , wrote in the introduction to the article in @entity147			1
gen. @entity162 , a doctor with the @entity164 program , agreed			0
" modern warfare is characterized by demanding missions , extreme climates , sleep deprivation , cultural dissonance , physical fatigue , prolonged separation from family and the ever - present threat of serious bodily injury or death , " @entity162 wrote			0
" waiting for illness or injury to occur is not the way commanders in the @entity2 approach high - risk actions , and it is not the way we should approach high psychological risk activities			1

the @entity35 will report on @entity2 suicide rates for 2010 wednesday
a study found pre-deployment screenings cut down on problems later
the soldier and unit both benefit from the screenings
