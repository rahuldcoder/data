another group of some 60 people took shelter during the storm at the @entity29 in @entity9 , and about 40 people remained there monday night			1

" we 're in safe ground so that 's why we 're a refuge for those , " @entity33 said			0
" we have a number of people that have gone back to their homes , but we understand that there is a lot of , at your own risk , where people are entering their homes and they believe that they 're sound ... but some homes have shifted ... and there 's just a lot of cleanup to do , " he added			1
