-- let 's say you 're on a job hunt and you 've talked with people at two different companies			2
at one , the leaders are bombastic , always proclaiming themselves right and never admitting wrong			2
they have swagger but little capacity for reflection			0
they seem more brittle than nimble			0
at the other , the leaders are sure of themselves in a different way : they do n't mind acknowledging their weaknesses			0
in fact , they have a culture of achieving success by keeping goals in mind and directly facing failures			0
which team would you rather join ? the question is n't about workplaces only			0
it 's about our country -- and whether we @entity28 are confident enough today to handle unpleasant truths			1
in the @entity32 , @entity30 , school district , a new right - leaning school board recently tried to push through a history curriculum that would celebrate @entity28 more and downplay the role of protests and social unrest			1
this move , perhaps predictably , has led to protests and social unrest by students and teachers			0
meanwhile , at the @entity45 last week , president @entity42 's speech about @entity43 and human rights made passing reference to @entity47 , @entity48 , and our own problems here at home			1
some critics jumped on @entity42 for preaching " moral equivalence " between @entity47 and @entity43 and for being an " apologizer in chief			1
" at play in both situations is a dispute about what it actually means to love this country			0
to the @entity63 school board , patriotism means talking up @entity28 , not talking it down			1
it means teaching children to behave -- and telling them that @entity28 was built by people who behaved			1
it 's the wishful thinking of people steeped in the status quo			2
similarly , to the critics of the president 's @entity45 speech , patriotism means pointing out aggressively where others have sinned , erred , fallen short -- but treating any acknowledgment of our own sins , errors , shortcomings as aiding and abetting evil			1
it 's the bluster of the deeply insecure			2
true patriotism comes not from being scared to talk about where @entity28 has failed ( and still fails ) to live up to its stated creed and ideals			1
it comes from naming those truths plainly and closing the gap between our ideals and our institutions			0
we have to combine reverence for our exceptional creed with a demanding skepticism toward claims that we have already fulfilled it			0
so consider , for instance , the @entity32 guidelines and their message to teach the virtues of " free enterprise			0
capitalism has generated more wealth in the @entity28 than had ever been generated in human history			1
at the same time , more of that wealth than we typically acknowledge was built on slave labor and , after the @entity111 , on the industrial indentured servitude of " freedmen			0
" this is a both / and , not an either / or			0
and citizens of a complex country like the @entity28 should be able to deal with such complexity			1
consider too : it is true both that the summer of 2014 marked the 50th anniversary of the signing of the @entity122 into law and that it marked the killing of an unarmed black youth in @entity48 that sparked national outrage and local upheaval			0
there is of course a legitimate case -- made mostly by conservatives -- that a country unwilling to instill in young people a spirit of patriotism is a country headed for trouble			2
after all , @entity28 has little to bind together a vast continent and a diverse people besides a civic creed on parchment and commercialism everywhere else			1
that 's why @entity143 , the historian of ancient @entity144 , argues that it 's a vital purpose of public education to make patriotic citizens			2
it 's not enough , as some of my friends on the left think , just to point out where @entity28 has faltered or to dissent against policies they do n't like			1
true patriotism requires more commitment			2
but to impart such patriotism to children we should behave like adults and not children			1
which means admitting that even though we @entity28 have done good things , and still do , we have also done bad things , and still do			1
the good may outweigh the bad but does n't excuse it			0
and when the bad is happening today -- in the treatment of african - americans in @entity47 , say -- the best way to be @entity28 is to confront it and make it better			1
even if that means being impolite and disobedient to authority			0
more than 140 years ago , a @entity28 senator from @entity48 stood to address the tin - pot patriots of his time			1
he was a @entity182 immigrant and had been a general of the @entity184 in the @entity111			0
to the jingoists ' chant of " my country , right or wrong , " @entity181 replied , " our country -- when right , to be kept right ; when wrong , to be set right			2
" put that in every school board 's curricular guidelines			1
put it on the desk of every pundit who finds it easier to demonize than to solve problems			0
and put it on the conscience of the complacent and the cynical alike			0
that 's patriotism for grown - ups .			2

@entity203 : some @entity30 school board *members* and @entity42 critics get patriotism wrong
there 's nothing *unpatriotic* about pointing out the ways @entity28 falls short , he says
*liu* : to impart patriotism to our children , we should act like adults
