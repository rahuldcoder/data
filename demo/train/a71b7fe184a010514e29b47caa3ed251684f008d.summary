-- muffled gun shots and squealing tires			0
a secret midnight meeting in a dark alley			0
alone in an exotic city with enemies lurking around every corner			0
everyone recognizes the classic elements of a good cloak and dagger story			0
from @entity12 to @entity13 , the spy thriller is one of literature 's most popular and enduring genres			1
right now the hottest name in this field is @entity19			1
he 's been called @entity21 © 's heir apparent , and the best espionage writer of his generation			1
for anyone who reads spy novels , that 's high praise			1
@entity19 is an @entity27 who has lived abroad for a good part of his adult life			1
he burst on to the publishing scene in 2003 with " @entity32 , " the first in a critically acclaimed five book series chronicling the cold war in a fictional eastern - bloc country			1
he followed that up with a thoughtful and thrilling trilogy about a reluctant @entity40 agent , @entity39 , who 's trying to survive and keep his family safe in a post 9/11 world			1
the first in that series , " @entity45 " was a bestseller , the second ; " @entity50 " won the 2010 @entity48 prize for best literary crime novel			1
now @entity19 returns with " @entity51			1
" debuting in book stores this week , it 's his third novel to feature @entity39 , formerly a member of the " @entity55 , " the @entity40 's home for black ops and dirty tricks			1
the story picks up after a @entity61 spy master has nearly wiped out the department			1
@entity39 is now one of only a handful of " tourists " -- a code name for @entity40 assassins -- left in the agency			1
when @entity39 's boss disappears and his family is threatened , @entity39 is drawn into a conspiracy that may link the @entity61 government to the highest levels of @entity27 intelligence			1
@entity0 recently spoke to @entity19 about his newest novel			1
the following is an edited transcript : @entity0 : what is it about the spy novel that has captured your imagination as a writer ? @entity19 : my first two books were more police procedurals , but i soon came to realize that i was more comfortable in the looser genre of spy fiction			1
one reason was simple practicality -- cops follow very specific procedures that as a writer you either adhere to or you do n't			1
if you do n't , you 're being unrealistic , and if you do , there 's a possibility you 'll end up straight - jacketed by these rules			0
so i gravitated toward the more free - flowing world of espionage			1
spies follow procedures , but they vary by agency and , by and large , we in the public do n't know what they are , so the writer is given a lot more latitude			2
more importantly , though , i find the grayness of espionage compelling			2
in crime fiction , the antagonist is usually the " bad guy " in the literal sense			0
in espionage , these labels are harder to affix , at least in my mind			2
if the antagonist is , say , a spy for @entity61 , he 's just someone doing what he can to advance his own country 's cause			2
the protagonist in a spy novel is doing the same thing			2
they are -- or can be -- equals , even when they commit morally heinous acts , and i love that moral quandary			0
it also explains why , thus far , i have n't been writing terrorist antagonists -- they 're much harder to empathize with			0
@entity0 : do you think readers love spy novels for the same reasons ? what do you think is behind the genre 's enduring popularity ? @entity19 : reader responses to spy novels seem to be as varied as the kinds of spy novels out there			1
some love high levels of realism , even if it means a spy spends most of his time at a desk , whereas others love spy stories for the action , no matter how unlikely it is			2
some are attracted by the illusion that they 're being given the keys to a secret world , one they would never be allowed into otherwise			2
some like being reassured by patriotic rhetoric , while others are reassured by the cynicism that many spy novels wallow in			2
as for its enduring popularity , i suppose that deception -- whether it 's found in crime novels or spy novels -- is just too thrilling for readers to go long without			2
@entity0 : you lived in @entity169 for a number of years , how did this influence your story telling ? @entity19 : the @entity174 influence began with a few weeks ' student exchange in high school , to @entity177 , @entity178			1
i was 14 at the time , and the exoticism of small details was immediately interesting to me -- i of course romanticized it all			0
in college , i did a semester abroad in @entity184 , @entity185			0
a momentous year -- it was 1989 , the @entity186 came down , and it was then that i decided to become a writer			2
so my fascination with that part of the world began early			2
just before writing " @entity32 " 11 years later , i spent a year on a fulbright fellowship to @entity192 , and all the research i did there shaped " @entity32 " and helped direct the course of the next four books , which charted the @entity198 history of @entity169			0
by the time i was writing my second book , " @entity201 , " i was living in @entity202 and then in @entity203 , where i 've spent the last decade			0
while all this @entity174 living has influenced the subject matter of my novels , i think more importantly it 's given me a window onto the world that 's different than the one i would 've had if i 'd spent the last 10 years in the @entity210			2
i was in @entity202 when 9/11 occurred , and i 've experienced the entire post- 9/11 era through more distant eyes			2
@entity0 : did the 9/11 attacks change your approach to writing a spy novel ? @entity19 : well , i 'd only finished one book by 9/11 , and i think at first my literary reaction was withdrawal			1
@entity220 , and radical @entity221 , seemed so complex and unknowable that instead of properly educating myself , i stuck with knowable history			0
it took a while before i recognized what i was doing , so by the time i finished my @entity198 sequence , i was chomping at the bit to give the contemporary world a try			0
thus , " @entity45 , " which tried to deal squarely with contemporary international relations			0
which is another way of saying that , after 9/11 , i took my time getting around to the subject			0
that said , you 'll notice that the @entity39 books deal less with terrorism than with the way terrorism has influenced other aspects of espionage and international relations			1
@entity0 : what kind of research did you do for " @entity51 " ? did you meet with any real agents ? @entity19 : i wish i could say i did ! but , no. my research is almost entirely scattershot -- i pick up information through online research , through books -- both nonfiction and fiction -- as well as movies			1
i 'm less interested in the technique of espionage as i am in the psychology of that world , and there are so many ways one can glean this kind of information			1
there 's a lot to be said for the power of imagination -- when the writing 's going well , the results can be shockingly correct			0
for example , when my @entity268 editor read the manuscript of " the tourist , " he sent me a complimentary e-mail , saying that as a " lifelong @entity273 " he was impressed that i 'd gotten @entity273 perfectly			0
what i hesitated to tell him was that , by the time i wrote that book , i 'd never stepped foot in @entity273 ! @entity0 : the " spy craft " in your book feels very authentic , is it rooted in reality or strictly from your imagination ? @entity19 : it 's a bit of both			1
through reading i 'll come across actual craft that i pick up , though you 'd be surprised how much realism you can acquire by simply getting into a character 's head and turning on the paranoia			0
if i wanted to get from @entity293 to @entity294 without anyone knowing , how would i go about this ? with a basic knowledge of how cell phones can be tracked , how surveillance cameras pepper highways and public spaces , one can gradually form a plan that looks a lot like real spy craft			0
and if it works , then there 's no reason to think it is n't spy craft			0
@entity0 : i hesitate to call him " the bad guy " but tell me more about how you came up with @entity61 spymaster , @entity311			0
@entity19 : i 've written very few " bad guys " in my time , and each time i 've regretted it			1
@entity311 , like any good antagonist , simply has different aims than our protagonist			0
since i do n't outline my stories or characters ahead of time , i do n't " come up " with characters before settling down to write a story -- instead , the characters are shaped by the story that 's coming together			0
there 's a lot of give and take between plot and character , so that it 's hard to tell where any particular thing comes from			0
which is another way of saying that @entity311 is not based on anyone i know of , and that there 's more mystery in writing than books on writing would have you believe ! @entity0 : what 's next for you , will there be another @entity39 novel ? @entity19 : i 'm taking a break from @entity39 's world and delving into @entity349 -- a book about spies that touches on the @entity354 revolution			1
as i said , it 's giving me a serious headache , but in my experience novels that get written easily are usually less compelling than the difficult ones , so i live in hope			0
