@entity0 , @entity1 -- at the @entity3 , @entity1 shopped for everything from vegetables to @entity7 flags			1
one side was destroyed in a 2008 fire			2
the january 12 earthquake leveled the rest			2
by year 's end , workers hope to restore the @entity0 landmark to its original splendor			1
destined for @entity19 in 1889 , the market 's @entity17 - built minarets became @entity1 's when the sale to a @entity22 train station fell through and president @entity23 bought the massive cast iron structures as part of his plan to modernize the city			1
it is the post-earthquake project that most excites @entity29 , a @entity0 engineer and co-owner of @entity1 's largest supplier of concrete			1
it 's inspiring to see the historical structure rise again amid the rubble , @entity29 said			1
but even more , the @entity3 restoration provides hope to those who live and work in its shadow -- especially because everyone knows @entity1 's rebuilding process is sure to be slow			1
by some estimates , it will take three to five years just to clear the rubble and debris still on the streets of @entity0			2
there is so much damage and destruction , so few trucks and places to dispose of the mangled steel and concrete and the piles of crushed furniture and personal possessions			2
the government plans to begin the reconstruction phase of the recovery process late this summer with some of the almost $ 10 billion pledged at a march donor conference			1
@entity1 say they intend to build differently than they did before the earthquake			1
the government , awakened to the nation 's construction follies , says it plans to crack down to ensure proper materials and techniques			1
' we have to change ' " the government has no administrative control on building projects here ( i.e. no building code to follow or building permits to take out ) , so when the @entity1 and the outside world ask why did this disaster happen , what can anybody say ? " a @entity81 structural engineer entered this web post about his trip to @entity1 after the earthquake			1
engineers agree there are no excuses for the shoddy building that took place in @entity1			1
" we 're in the state we 're in because of one thing , because of poor construction practices , " said @entity29 , who heads @entity90			1
" we have to change			2
i 've been saying it for more than 10 years			2
" too many people suffered in the earthquake			2
if nothing else , @entity29 said he hopes fear will now serve as a guiding factor			2
gay 's firm built the @entity104 @entity103 here , as well as telecommunications firm @entity107 's glass tower and other structures that withstood the earthquake			1
but without government regulation , enforced building codes and mandatory inspections , much of the rest of @entity1 built as it pleased : cheaply			1
gay said concrete and cement companies used sand containing calcium carbonate , a " recipe for disaster , " or diluted the strength of the cement with too much water , a cost - saving measure			2
steel rebar was smooth , not marked with ridges as it is in the @entity104 , which helps lock concrete in place			2
only four bars of steel were used for every column , not eight as in @entity104 , @entity1 did the minimum to raise a building , said @entity137 engineering professor @entity136			1
forget about withstanding a magnitude - 7.0 earthquake			2
@entity136 , who has been making periodic trips to @entity1 to help assess damage , said complicating @entity1 's rebuilding is that structures have to be both earthquake - and hurricane - resistant			1
the former requires heavy , solid construction ; the latter requires reinforcement and malleability			2
" a small difference in technique can make a huge difference , @entity136 said			0
but ultimately " it 's about changing the whole culture of building			1
thankfully , he said , there is n't anyone left in @entity1 who does n't feel accountable			1
" the problem is that there was never any incentive to do it properly			0
the government has to do its job			0
" for the first time , the government intends to inspect new construction			0
it is requiring permits of those who want to repair damaged houses that have been marked as salvageable by the @entity167			0
inspectors have even stopped some questionable reconstruction projects			1
it is also working with foreign experts to train @entity1 engineers and masons ; to make sure the nation has the skill set to build wisely			1
the @entity176 partnered with well - known @entity104 structural engineer @entity177 to train engineers			1
already , 500 have been trained , according to @entity178 , a member of the government 's reconstruction committee			1
@entity177 said the biggest challenge has been the sheer number of damaged buildings			0
so far , he said , about 70,000 have been assessed			0
" we need to come up with a unique strategic idea to deal with hundreds of thousands of structures to be repaired and reconstructed , " he said			1
" it may take some time but they will get there			0
" the sound of hammers and saws construction issues and messy post-earthquake land disputes could slow the rebuilding effort			0
but with the urgent need for sound housing , some aid agencies have begun to construct transitional homes for thousands of @entity1 facing a potentially violent rainy season without a roof over their heads			1
some already have permanent materials ; others can later be reinforced			0
plans call for thousands of these tiny homes to dot the landscape			0
they go up quickly and relatively cheaply , and are not subject to complex building codes and inspections			1
the noise of hammers and saws can be heard outside @entity0 , in places like @entity215 and in @entity216 , where land was available to build			0
@entity218 oversees 45 carpenters for @entity220			0
they are constructing plywood and corrugated tin shelters near @entity215 , on empty fields lined by watermelon crops and crimson hibiscus			0
the @entity220 houses consist of nine wooden posts rooted in buckets of concrete that can be removed later if necessary			0
the heavy - duty tarps that wrap around the posts can one day be replaced by more permanent materials , including concrete			0
in the near future , @entity220 is planning to build 1,000 such homes near @entity215 and another 1,000 in hard - hit @entity216 to the west , said @entity220 's @entity236			1
for @entity238 , the small one - room house is a gift from @entity240 , the only bright spot in the four months since the quake			0
he proudly showed it off			0
a carved wooden china cabinet was filled with ceramic cups and dishes			0
the bed was dressed in crisp white linens			0
it was a far cry from the forlorn tin shack across the yard			0
that 's where he used to sleep with his wife and four children			1
he put his hand to his calf to show how high the water rose when it rained			0
@entity178 said he is thankful for a proper roof over his children 's heads			2
he knows he is among the lucky ones			0
" the demand is so high here , " @entity220 's @entity218 said			2
" there is someone asking for a house every minute			0
" in @entity216 , an @entity104 missionary group helped put up neat rows of pre-fabricated compressed wood huts			0
in each was a dining table , chairs , a bed -- a semblance of normalcy for those left with nothing			0
above the door in every house was a wooden placard that said , in @entity284 : " @entity285			0
" @entity240 bless this house .			0

reconstruction phase of @entity1 's recovery begins this summer
@entity1 hope to employ better building practices
hundreds of engineers are being trained
aid groups have already started building transitional home
