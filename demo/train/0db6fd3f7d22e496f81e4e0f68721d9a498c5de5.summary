-- @entity1 will kick off its annual @entity4 developers ' conference wednesday in @entity5 , but ceo @entity6 wo n't be speaking there			1
he also was a no - show at thursday 's annual stockholders meeting and is expected to miss the company 's quarterly earnings call next month			1
left to explain @entity6 's unexpected absence at the shareholder 's meeting , @entity1 executive chairman @entity11 told attendees that @entity6 had " lost his voice " and " ca n't do any public speaking engagements for the time being			1
" in an e-mail to employees the same day , @entity6 wrote , " there is nothing seriously wrong with me , " a person familiar with the matter told the @entity26			2
the company issued a statement thursday saying , " @entity6 has lost his voice			1
this means he ca n't do any public speaking engagements for the time being , including today 's shareholder meeting , @entity4 next week and our earnings call in mid july			1
" @entity6 will , of course , continue to run the company and he will be involved in all the strategic business decisions we make			2
" there is no evidence that @entity6 , who has long been reluctant to speak in public , is seriously ill. but four days later , @entity1 has had nothing else to say on the matter , and analysts and bloggers are getting restless			1
news sites have speculated about @entity6 's " mystery @entity46 , " and @entity1 's stock has been trending down since late last week			1
" we have no specific reason to think there is anything more to @entity6 's condition , but we find it odd that the company would already rule him out of the @entity59 call , which is likely still a few weeks away , " said @entity48 , an analyst at @entity49			2
" we think this could raise some questions among investors			0
" @entity63 : where 's @entity6 ? investors deserve to know " we have absolutely no idea what is going on , " said @entity63 's assistant managing editor , @entity66 , in a video report monday			2
" we can only hope that it 's nothing serious , maybe just a really bad case of laryngitis , and he 's under doctor 's orders not to speak			0
" observers point out that while @entity6 's health may be a private matter , @entity1 is a publicly traded company			1
" there should n't be any mystery ( here ) , " @entity66 added			0
" @entity1 should own up to whatever it is			0
... it could stop , maybe , any rumors from going around			0
" the health of a tech giant 's ceo may bear extra scrutiny at a time @entity89 is still recovering from the death last fall of @entity93 chief @entity92			2
many investors and others criticized @entity93 for failing to disclose details about @entity92 ' condition			0
@entity6 , 39 , is one of @entity1 's two co-founders and took over as ceo last year after @entity11 became chairman			1
" not being able to speak hardly puts someone on the same path as @entity92 , nor does it keep him from making key decisions or pointing his company in the right direction			0
it 's also possible the full extent of what 's ailing him is n't known , " wrote @entity106 on monday in the @entity107			0
but " more specific information could calm any rattled nerves of investors , keep customers from worrying , and stop remote diagnoses from being offered in the press , " she added			0
" more than likely , the matter would cease to be an issue : everyone would say " get well soon , " and move on			0

@entity1 ceo @entity6 " lost his voice , " wo n't be speaking at company 's conference this week
but @entity1 has offered few details , leading to speculation about " mystery illness "
some analysts and tech reporters have criticized the company 's silence on the matter
