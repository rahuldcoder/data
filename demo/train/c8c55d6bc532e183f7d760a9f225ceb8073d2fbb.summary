@entity0 -- @entity2 and @entity3 have been ordered to face an @entity5 appellate court again for the murder of @entity7			1
the scene in the @entity5 courtroom on tuesday morning was oddly reminiscent of verdicts past in the complicated case , with the exception of two missing characters : @entity14 and @entity3			1
the rest were there , including the lawyers who defended the two former lovers and the lawyers who represented the family of the victim -- and of course the hoard of television cameras who had come for the latest installment of the seemingly endless saga			0
@entity27 , who shared an apartment with @entity14 in @entity29 near the @entity30 , was stabbed in her bedroom and left for dead on november 1 , 2007			1
her autopsy showed that she choked on her own blood			0
she had not been raped , according to her autopsy , but she was found partially nude , adding an element of mystery to the case that laid the groundwork for what would become a theory that @entity27 died as part of a " sex game gone wrong			2
" the door to her bedroom was locked from the inside and pulled closed			0
@entity14 vows to fight on as @entity5 judges order retrial there were no fingerprints on the outside of the door and scant blood in the rest of the house , which eventually led to the theory of a cleanup			1
@entity7 , an @entity55 native who was raised by a local family in @entity29 , was the first to be found guilty of the crime in a fast - track trial in 2008			2
his conviction was upheld on appeal but his sentence was reduced from 30 years to just 16 years			0
@entity14 and @entity3 were initially found guilty in connection with @entity27 's murder , but were ultimately acquitted two years later on appeal			1
@entity14 went home to @entity66 to finish her studies at the @entity68			2
@entity3 moved to @entity69 to take up studies in robotic surgery			0
the case seemed to be over			0
for most people , especially those of us who followed the case closely , the high court hearing was supposed to be just a formality -- they would confirm the acquittal and we could all go home and put the case to rest			0
now everything is up in the air again			0
@entity5 's highest court decided to reject the acquittal in its entirety and send the case back to a panel of appellate judges to reconsider			1
what that means in practical terms is nothing short of a complicated , confusing mess			0
when @entity14 was first convicted of murder , there was outcry in the @entity98 that she was wrongfully convicted , based on shoddy evidence collected by sloppy @entity5 police			1
when she was acquitted two years later , there was nearly as much of an outcry in @entity5 that the courts had succumbed to @entity98 pressure			1
now , the outcome is again uncertain , with the only guarantee that whatever happens , it will again cause an outcry -- it 's just not clear yet by whom			1
but even though retrying the case may seem something like @entity115 vu , there is going to be one stark difference			0
@entity14 will not be in court this time around			2
during the first trial in which she was convicted and the appeal in which she was acquitted , she was the star of the show that drew the masses to court each week			2
her lawyer , @entity124 , believes @entity14 will not attend and will be tried in absentia this time			1
timeline : @entity7 murder case without her presence , it remains to be seen whether the media will be as interested			0
even if @entity14 is convicted this time around , it is unlikely she will ever come back to @entity5			1
there is a valid extradition agreement between the two nations , but the @entity98 has not set much of a precedence in returning suspects for such matters			1
in 1998 , an @entity98 fighter jet clipped a ski lift cable sending a gondola of 20 passengers to their death in the @entity5 @entity146 mountain range			1
@entity5 had requested their extradition to try them for multiple manslaughter , but the @entity98 refused and tried them in a military tribunal instead			1
they were found not guilty			0
and in 2012 , @entity5 's high court upheld the conviction of 22 @entity157 agents and an @entity159 colonel in conjunction with the extraordinary rendition of @entity163 cleric @entity162 from a street in @entity165			1
again , the @entity98 refused to comply with the extradition order			1
both previous high - profile cases involved state employees or military members			0
@entity14 's case is a private matter with very little precedence			1
@entity14 may be safe in @entity66 , but her erstwhile boyfriend is far more vulnerable here in @entity5			1
by the same law that protects @entity14 , @entity3 is also free to skip the retrial			2
but because he is an @entity5 citizen , he will not have to face extradition if reconvicted			1
experts disagree over extradition for @entity2 the police can simply pick him up and put him in jail			2
@entity3 's father attended the high court hearing on monday but he was not present for tuesday 's verdict			0
he has staunchly defended his son 's innocence , but it remains to be seen if he supports having him stay here in @entity5 for the retrial			2
the only people who expressed relief at tuesday 's verdict and news of the retrial were @entity27 's family			2
their lawyer @entity194 said they felt that now , finally , " justice might be served			0
" when @entity14 was acquitted of the murder in 2011 , the @entity196 were left flabbergasted and disappointed by the reversal			2
" we respect the court but we had hoped for a different outcome , " @entity27 's mother told me the day @entity14 was set free			1
@entity7 's brother @entity203 said that he felt the wounds had been left open			0
" we have n't really had a chance to properly grieve , " he said at the time			0
" we accept the decision and respect the court			0
but now we are left looking at this again			0
we really are back to square one			0
" no matter how the case ultimately ends , there will likely always be far more questions than answers .			0

@entity215 : only guarantee in @entity27 murder trial is that new result will cause outcry
@entity2 's lawyer believes @entity14 will not attend trial and will be tried in absentia
@entity98 has declined to respect extradition treaty with @entity5 in the past
