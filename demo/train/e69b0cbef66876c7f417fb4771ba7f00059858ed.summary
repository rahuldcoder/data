@entity0 -- faulty electrical wiring is already suspected in the deaths of several @entity5 troops in @entity6			1
now contractors who worked in @entity9 are reporting similar problems at @entity5 bases there			1
in july , sen. @entity12 held a hearing on troop electrocutions			0
he wants a faster response to the problem			0
" in general , the electrical power systems in the camp can be described as a disaster waiting to happen , " electrician @entity17 wrote to his bosses at military contractor @entity19 about conditions at one base in 2005			1
the letter warned of " extreme dangers " of electrical shock and fire hazards at the facility			0
@entity17 , who left @entity9 shortly after writing that letter , told @entity1 that the work done by @entity19 at one @entity5 base in @entity33 was " by far " the worst he has seen in 20 - plus years in the trade			1
" as a complete whole , the electrical work at the camp was very dangerous , " he said			1
" and i do n't think it would be an exaggeration to say that i do n't believe any of it was done safely			0
" @entity40 says he saw similar electrical hazards when he worked as an electrician in @entity9			1
@entity40 , also a former @entity19 electrician , told a @entity45 meeting in 2008 that " the carelessness and disregard for quality work at @entity19 was pervasive			1
" in one case , @entity40 said , a soldier at a field command post received a 400 - volt shock from wiring that other soldiers told him had been installed by a plumber and a security guard			2
the 20 - year veteran of the trade said @entity19 hired many unqualified or unlicensed electricians , and relied heavily on @entity60 workers who were unfamiliar with @entity5 standards and spoke little or no @entity62			1
" i saw firsthand how @entity19 's carelessness unnecessarily put people 's lives in danger , " he testified			0
@entity40 , @entity17 and three other experienced electricians who worked for @entity19 in 2005 and 2006 told @entity1 that their warnings to supervisors were ignored			1
the electricians showed @entity1 photographs they say show dangerous wiring , and overloaded or badly wired circuit panels that have caused fires at @entity5 installations			2
and several @entity5 soldiers who were stationed in @entity9 said they received electrical shocks themselves or knew soldiers who suffered them			1
the soldiers said they preferred to not be identified because of possible retribution from the @entity81			0
@entity19 would not comment on specific criticism about the company 's work in @entity9 , but it has consistently denied any improper electrical work or responsibility for deaths or injuries			1
" the electrical standards in @entity6 are nowhere near those of @entity93 standards , " it told @entity1 in a written statement			0
" so we are adapting to an environment that existed long before @entity19 got on the ground in @entity6 and @entity9			1
" in @entity6 , at least 18 @entity5 troops are known to have died by electrocution -- many while on @entity5 bases being managed by various military contractors , including @entity19			1
the @entity101 would not say whether there were any fatalities or serious injuries from electrocutions in @entity9 , telling @entity1 it would not comment on an ongoing investigation by the @entity101 's inspector general			2
but the @entity101 said it considers electrical dangers to be " a very serious issue , " and has launched widespread inspections in @entity9 and @entity6 to fix any electrical hazards and ensure that future installations comply with @entity5 electrical code			1
sen. @entity12 of @entity114 , who leads the @entity45 , said the accounts from @entity9 show " some of the same problems exist in both war theaters			0
" " i do n't think the problem has been fixed , " @entity12 said			0
" i do n't think at this point the @entity101 has bitten the bullet to say , ' we 're going to fix these problems in a very significant way , and we 're going to cause contractors to be accountable for their work			0
' i think , as a result of it not being fixed , i think there are risks			0
" @entity12 said he was " outraged " at the @entity101 for not moving faster to fix electrical hazards			0
" our soldiers should n't be taking risks by taking showers , " he said			0
" they ought to be able to expect that the electrical work at their military base is not going to result in their death or injury because of shoddy workmanship			1
" @entity19 has already come under fire for its work in @entity6			2
the @entity81 's lead investigator into the death of staff sgt. @entity145 , of @entity146 , @entity147 , recently wrote that she would recommend @entity149 's cause of death be changed to " negligent homicide			0
" her report accused @entity19 of failing to properly supervise or inspect its work , but the @entity81 has yet to make a final ruling on the case			2
@entity145 was found dead in the shower in his @entity158 quarters in january 2008			0
two of the soldiers who told @entity1 that they suffered shocks in @entity9 said they were in showers at the time as well			2
@entity81 inspectors recently found @entity19 failed to do proper electrical wiring on bases in @entity6			2
their report found that incidents of electric shock were happening an average of every three days for nearly two years , and that the company was in serious violation of its contract .			0
