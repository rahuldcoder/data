-- a cheating scandal at @entity2 just got bigger , and this time the focus is flipped : administrators , not students , are under fire			1
on monday , the school apologized for the way it handled a secret search of the e-mail accounts of resident deans			1
it conducted the search in an effort to find who leaked information about the scandal to the media last year			2
" while the specific document made public may be deemed by some as not particularly consequential , the disclosure of the document and nearly word - for - word disclosure of a confidential board conversation led to concerns that other information -- especially student information we have a duty to protect as private -- was at risk , " said a statement from @entity21 @entity20 and @entity22			0
" consequently , with the approval of the dean of @entity39 ( @entity40 ) and the university general counsel , and the support of the dean of @entity2 , a very narrow , careful , and precise subject - line search was conducted by the @entity41 's it department , " they added			1
@entity20 and @entity22 stressed that the search was limited to administrative accounts , and that it did not involve a review of e-mail content			1
@entity2 students forced to withdraw amid cheating scandal " to be clear : no one 's e-mails were opened and the contents of no one 's e-mails were searched by human or machine , " they said			1
the search successfully identified a resident dean , who had forwarded a confidential e-mail			2
however , after review , school officials determined the dean in question had committed " an inadvertent error and not an intentional breach " by sending the message to two students			0
other resident deans were not told of the search , which was first reported by the @entity74			1
" operating without any clear precedent for the conflicting privacy concerns and knowing that no human had looked at any e-mails during or after the investigation , we made a decision that protected the privacy of the resident dean who had made an inadvertent error and allowed the student cases being handled by this resident dean to move forward expeditiously , " @entity20 and @entity22 said			0
" we understand that others may see the situation differently , and we apologize if any resident deans feel our communication at the conclusion of the investigation was insufficient , " they added			1
news of the secret search drew immediate criticism from some members of @entity2 's faculty			1
@entity97 , a professor and former dean of @entity2 , said on his blog that he will likely move most of his personal e-mails to another account , keeping his @entity2 address just for business			2
he described the way the school handled the case as dishonorable			0
" why not tell people you are reading their e-mail ? would it not be the honorable thing to do ? what is to be gained by not doing that ? other than avoiding , perhaps , the embarrassment of acknowledging that you are doing something to which the targets would reasonably object if they knew it , " he wrote			0
attempts to contact @entity2 for details on monday on the search and the handling of it were unsuccessful			2
last month , the school announced that more than half the students implicated in the cheating scandal had been required to withdraw for a time			2
more than a hundred students were investigated for plagiarism or for having " inappropriately collaborated " on a course 's take - home , open - book spring final exam			0
the class was @entity132 1310 : introduction to @entity133 , according to the @entity134 , the school 's student newspaper			0
many of those who were not forced to withdraw faced disciplinary probation at the @entity140 institution in @entity141 , @entity142 , and the remaining were cleared			0
@entity0 's @entity143 contributed to this report .			0
