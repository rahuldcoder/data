as the news broke friday about the 2011 winners , @entity3 was just getting out of bed			1
" my husband is already on his computer , and i hear him say , ' woah ! three women ! ' " @entity3 rushed to him and peered at the monitor			1
@entity28 president @entity27 , activist @entity29 of @entity28 and rights activist @entity30 of @entity31			2
on television , a @entity12 official explained the decision to award the prize jointly			0
the women were chosen " for their nonviolent struggle for the safety of women and for women 's rights ... " we can not achieve democracy and lasting peace in the world unless women obtain the same opportunities as men to influence development of all levels of society , " he said			1
she knows @entity29 , she said , and loved that the @entity2 was being given to three women , raising the total number of women who have individually won the prize to 15 , according to the prize 's official site			1
only nine @entity59 are still living , according to the @entity60			0
" @entity29 is incredibly powerful and sure of herself , " @entity3 told @entity0			1
" she has no trouble dealing with the media			0

" @entity3 was startled in 1997 when she got the call that she had won			1
looking out her window at 5 a.m. that day in october , she saw reporters camped out on her gravel driveway in @entity70			0
though she knew she was on the @entity2 short list , she had n't believed she would win			1
@entity3 assumed the award would go to more prominent people within the organization where she worked			1
as an introvert , she said , she was worried			0
but she managed to do interview after interview that day			0
the spotlight has n't dimmed as time has passed			0
" it was a lot of attention all at once , which was hard for me personally , but it was incredible for the campaign and that was the important thing , " she said			2

she was awarded the @entity12 a month later			0
@entity3 predicts that the @entity12 awarded to two relatively unknown female activists will put more focus on democratic uprisings in the @entity106 and @entity107			1
and it will make @entity30 a visual representation of the @entity110			0
" that is going to be totally intense , " @entity3 said			1
" but it 's awesome			0
" it will be impossible for these @entity2 winners and the women they represent to be tamped down or forgotten or told what to do as the movements in their countries unfold and slowly resolve , @entity3 said			1
" you ca n't have them go back into the kitchen once they 've overthrown the dictator , " @entity3 said			2
giving the @entity12 to all the women at once signals a declaration of sorts to the world			0
it says : we 're not going back			0
we are stronger in numbers			0
sharing the prize , as two @entity134 peace activists have in the past , does not diminish the honor , @entity3 stressed			2
she has heard criticism to that point and believes it 's important to quash that mentality			2
" they were jointly recognized because each of them has done significant work nonviolently to being about democratic change to stop violence against women , " @entity3 said			1
women tend to work together , she added			0
it seems fitting that they share the prize			0
@entity3 offered advice to the women who won friday : remain true to yourself , she said			1
