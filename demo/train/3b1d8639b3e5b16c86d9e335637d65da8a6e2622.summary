@entity0 -- the wedding photo shows the happy couple poised to kiss , ready to begin an adventure that has now taken them to the @entity7 @entity6			1
for @entity9 and @entity10 , this is a fight for recognition by the federal government of their legal same - sex union , part of a landmark constitutional appeal over same - sex marriage and " equal protection			1
" their love has united them , but the larger social issue has split the country for more than four decades			0
the @entity0 , couple legally married last october , but not in the eyes of some of their employers or elected leaders			1
@entity9 serves her community as a metropolitan police officer			0
@entity10 serves her country in the @entity32			0
but since she is a federal worker , the couple can not share the 1,000 - plus federal perks enjoyed by married heterosexuals : things like joint tax returns , loan programs for veterans , and survivor , pension , bankruptcy , family medical leave and health insurance benefits			1
opinion : @entity7 is at a crossroads on gay rights under the @entity49 ( @entity49 ) passed in 1996 , marriage is defined for federal purposes as between one man and one woman			1
that means the estimated 120,000 gay and lesbian couples legally married in nine states and the @entity0 are still considered , in the eyes of @entity49 opponents , the equivalent of girlfriend and boyfriend			1
" as a federal employee and as an airman , you get a constant reminder that you 're second class , " @entity10 told @entity1			2
" i had to list @entity9 as my sister just so that someone would call her in the event that i 'm killed or missing in action , or i 'm hurt on the job			0
she ca n't be my emergency contact , she ca n't receive my remains			0
as far as my death benefit , i had to list her as ' other			0
' " adding to the confusion is @entity9 's status as a @entity0 government employee			1
she enjoys the benefits of her relationship with @entity10 because her local government in the nation 's capital recognizes same - sex marriage			1
" but once we step outside of @entity0 , it 's a whole other ballgame , " said @entity9			1
in neighboring @entity86 , which does not recognize their marriage , the couple says they are viewed as " legal strangers			2
" opinion : gay people live in 50 @entity93 what is the federal government 's role in defining marriage ? the larger debate over @entity49 's intent and impact 17 years after passage has driven a wedge between the executive and legislative branches			1
now that debate will be center stage before the @entity6 , which will hear oral arguments wednesday , with an expected ruling in late june			1
at issue is what role the federal government should play when it comes to marriage , something states have traditionally controlled			2
" what the court is being asked to decide is whether or not @entity119 can pass a law that treats same - sex couples , who are already married under the laws of their state , different from opposite - sex couples , " said @entity114 , a leading appellate attorney and editor of @entity116			1
four federal district courts and two appeals courts have already struck down the law 's restrictive benefits provision			2
and in a rare move , the @entity132 administration also abandoned its defense of congressional authority , saying @entity49 is unconstitutional			2
5 turning points in gay marriage debate that has left @entity139 in the unconventional position of stepping in to argue it should stay in place , at least for now			1
traditionally , the role of defending federal law would fall to the @entity7 solicitor general 's office			1
but president @entity132 , in an election - year stunner , said last may he now supports same - sex marriage			1
the president had already ordered attorney general @entity150 not to defend @entity49			2
that raised the question of whether any party could rightfully step in and defend the law			2
besides the constitutional issue , the justices had specifically ordered opposing sides to argue a supplemental question : whether congressional @entity159 , operating officially as the @entity160 of the @entity7 @entity161 , have " standing " or legal authority to make the case			2
opinion : slowly , @entity159 shifting on same - sex marriage " let 's not confuse the issue of @entity49 and the administration 's decision that it was unconstitutional , " house speaker @entity166 , @entity167 , told @entity1			1
" it is not their role to decide what 's constitutional			0
@entity49 was a law that was passed by the @entity161 and @entity177 and signed into law by president @entity179			1
in our system of government , the administration does n't get to decide what 's constitutional , the @entity6 does			2
and in our financing the lawsuit was to make sure the proper forum was used to make sure that we know what 's constitutional and what is n't			0
" supporters of traditional marriage agree			0
" @entity49 's important because @entity119 said it 's important , " said @entity192 , senior counsel at the legal ministry @entity193			1
" we sent our elected representatives to @entity0 , and they chose to say that marriage is one man and one woman for purposes of federal law			1
" and many conservatives argue the courts should stay out of the larger constitutional issues and let citizens and the legislatures hash it out			0
some activists worry nine unelected justices will issue a sweeping 50 - state mandate and redefine marriage as whatever personal bond they now think it is			2
@entity211 , chief counsel of the @entity212 , says nothing in the @entity214 tells states whether and how they should " evolve " on such an established institution			0
she said liberty is a fundamental right , but that government also has broad discretion to affirm the idea marriage is mainly about ensuring biological children are raised in a stable two - parent family with a mother and father			2
same - sex marriage in the 21st century " is clearly not what anyone understood as marriage at the time of the framing of the @entity214 , " she told @entity1 , saying that should be enough to keep the high court out of the current case			1
@entity235 marries same - sex couple but state wo n't recognize it lack of protections , benefits if partner deploys @entity10 and @entity9 said they hit it off immediately after they met by chance at a downtown club 's @entity245 , and felt like they had known each other forever			1
they were together four years before marrying last october			0
@entity9 said she went to @entity10 's mother first to ask her daughter 's hand in wedlock			0
sitting in their comfortable @entity0 home , they appear blissfully happy being together , but @entity49 has put unexpected strains on the marriage because of " little frustrations			1
" for one thing , they worry what could happen when @entity10 gets sent overseas in a war zone			0
" technically , i am a single person deploying , " she said			0
" so i do n't have any protection for my family			0
i could deploy tomorrow and there would be nothing in place to help my family			0
it would be just me			0
so that 's definitely scary			0
financially , making sure that the responsibility that we have to each other and to our families is taken care of , and it would be like i 'm leaving @entity9 in a lurch			0
" @entity9 added : " it 's like we have to still go above and beyond just to get to where heterosexual couples already are			0
" docs : same - sex marriage benefits kids they believe they are burdened by a triple social stigma : as women , black , and lesbians			1
the couple hope to have children someday , but that would create further layers of what they say are discriminatory rules			0
for now this self - described " boring couple " say they look forward to the day their children would be born and raised in a @entity300 world			2
but regardless how the @entity6 rules , they say they will persevere			2
" i should be able to walk with my wife hand in hand and live our life			0
we should n't have to sit here on the edge of our seats , waiting for a decision , " said @entity9			0
" are we going to finally be able to just be recognized without any strings attached ? ... we 're humans , we live in a strange society , and we have to work with what we 've got			0
" same - sex couples take long road to altar @entity1 's @entity318 and @entity319 contributed to this report .			1
