-- if there 's anything @entity4 knows for sure , it 's what the love of a dog can do for your life			2
" there is nothing in the world like puppy love , " @entity4 says			2
inmates at the @entity15 work with the dogs to prepare them to help wounded troops			1
still , dogs are more than just companions			2
they can be the eyes for those who ca n't see , lead those who ca n't walk and calm people suffering from conditions like post-traumatic stress disorder			2
where do these service dogs get their start ? for some , it all begins behind prison walls ... at the @entity15 in @entity36 , more than 1,600 men convicted of abuse , robbery and murder are serving their time			1
" i 've been incarcerated for robbery in the first degree , " an inmate named @entity39 says			0
" i really had no regards for other people			0
it was always me , me , me , me			0
" now , a groundbreaking program called @entity46 is transforming these offenders			0
inmates are given 8 - week - old puppies and taught to train them to become service dogs for the disabled , including wounded soldiers			1
the puppies and prisoners are together 24 hours a day			2
the puppies sleep in crates in the inmates ' cells			1
in return , the puppies give the prisoners something many of them have never experienced before -- unconditional love			2
" i 'm going to make my family and those around me proud of me again			0
joining this program , it helped me to give myself a sense of pride again			0
to know that by nurturing and raising these dogs to their fullest potential , that i could give back			2
" @entity0 : amazing animal friendships you have to see animal lover and five - time @entity78 nominee @entity76 first learned about @entity46 when she volunteered to help inmates at the women 's prison in her town			2
she was so moved by the impact of the program that she called " the @entity0 " herself to share this story			0
" we know the bond that can be created between humans and animals			0
and there is common knowledge that it 's a healing quality , " she says			0
" the bond that 's created between inmates -- who never knew love , never knew responsibility , have only been told that they 're worthless -- and the bond that they then train their dogs to establish with these wounded returning veterans from @entity102 and @entity103 is changing their lives			1
" @entity0 : 10 inspiring pets @entity106 is an inmate whose life has been changed by the program			1
convicted of second - degree murder , @entity106 has been in prison since he was 17			1
" i am now 33 years old			0
i wish i could turn back the hands of time for the hurt and pain that i 've caused so many people , especially my victim 's family , " he says			0
@entity106 was chosen for @entity46 and immediately bonded with his yellow lab , @entity119			1
" from the moment i got her , it was amazing , " he says			0
" there was some beautiful moments in here that i shared with my puppy			0
" eventually , @entity119 had to move on -- and @entity106 had to say goodbye			1
" the first night i was without @entity119 , i have to say it was a long night , " he says			1
" it was hard for me to realize that the next morning i was going to wake up and not actually feed her that morning			0
" since leaving @entity106 , @entity119 has become a lifeline for sgt. @entity131 , who suffers from traumatic brain injury and severe combat - related post-traumatic stress disorder after he was hit by a roadside bomb in @entity102			1
@entity119 helps sgt. hill overcome his paralyzing , violent flashbacks by kissing his face			1
after a few months together , @entity139 and @entity119 return to @entity15 to meet @entity106			1
when @entity119 sees @entity106 , she takes off running			1
" she looks beautiful , " @entity106 says			1
sgt. @entity131 thanks @entity106 for all that he 's done			1
" @entity119 has been there for me			1
she 's been my rock when i 've needed her to help me out with a flashback or a nightmare			0
i can do things that for a year and a half i could n't do , " sgt. @entity131 says			1
" this is an overwhelming feeling , and to see you is breathtaking , " he says			0
" and to see what @entity119 had done in your life			1
" @entity0 : animals that are working hard every day now paroled , @entity106 is expected to be released from prison this summer , but what he learned from @entity46 will stay with him forever			1
" being able to be involved in the puppy program has taught me to be a responsible person , " he says			2
" it has taught me patience			1
" sgt. @entity131 , his wife , @entity161 , say @entity119 has changed their lives			1
" the biggest difference that @entity119 has made in my life was , one , she allowed me the opportunity to go back to church , " he says			1
" and , two , she 's helping me gain my independence back so i 'm not so reliant on @entity161 and other family members			0
" @entity161 says she 's starting to see her husband 's playful , energetic side come through once again			0
" we 're starting to see that side of him again that we have n't seen in the year and a half he 's been home from @entity102 , " she says			1
" @entity119 has brought my sons their daddy home			2
she has lit the light back in him that had been so dark			0
" perhaps the greatest legacy of @entity46 is the lesson of love each inmate learns			0
@entity185 , another prisoner at the @entity15 , is currently training @entity186 , his third dog			2
" she brought forth in me the ability to love again			0
it had been so dormant in me for so long because of the cold place that i 'm in , " he says			0
