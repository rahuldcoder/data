editor 's note : @entity2 is deputy director of @entity3 , a project of the @entity5 , a @entity6 - based organization that describes itself as dedicated to progressive causes			1
she works to engage the millennial generation and other underrepresented communities in the political process			2
she can be found at ericawilliamsonline.com and on twitter at @ ericawilliamsdc			0
@entity2 says @entity13 consistently exemplified the hope for an open , just and inclusive @entity16			1
( @entity17 ) -- sen. @entity13 may have been 77 years old , but he embodied the spirit , determination and core values of my generation -- the millenials -- in a way that no other senator has in our lifetime			1
how ironic that the passing of one of the oldest and longest serving senators has left me , a 25 - year - old woman , frantically searching for a fierce , dedicated ally for causes that concern young @entity16			0
as a young person with equal parts hope in -- and criticism of -- @entity16 's body politic , i value the length of time @entity13 spent championing the causes of those constituencies that are traditionally underrepresented in the political process and also the tenacity , savvy and consistency with which he did it			1
when i first began working in politics , advocating for the political empowerment and representation of young people , i quickly learned that @entity13 not only fought for us , but also eagerly and wholeheartedly worked with us			1
he spoke at student rallies , held press conferences with youth organizations and ensured that his staff kept an open and accessible ear to the interests , concerns and needs of those of us who worked full time to engage young people			0
ultimately , the proof was in the pudding			0
some of his most memorable accomplishments were those that centered on young people in an explicit way			0
in 1970 , at the height of the @entity72 , when young men were dying in record numbers , @entity13 championed an amendment to the @entity76 that lowered the voting age from 21 to 18			1
he felt that those old enough to risk their lives for their country were old enough to have a voice in its elections			0
@entity13 was also a consistent , hard - working and effective advocate for making higher education affordable and accessible			1
he steadily worked toward his goal of reforming the student financial system and played a valuable role in nearly every major federal student - aid program in our nation 's history , from @entity91 in 1972 to the @entity92 and smart grants for high - achieving low - income students in 2006			1
he was also a chief architect of the federal direct - loan program , in which the government lends money to students through their colleges			0
he consistently opposed efforts to eliminate programs and offered dozens of budget amendments to increase the maximum @entity91			1
he worked to reauthorize the @entity103 in 2008 , which expanded federal grant aid , put new regulations in place to prevent abuse of student lending , simplified the student application process for federal aid and established debt forgiveness for public service			0
even as he neared the end of his life , @entity13 prioritized those at the beginning of their own			1
he championed the @entity120 , signed into law just this year , which created 175,000 positions in public service in @entity124 and other organizations that work on education , health care , energy and veterans services			2
but these policies speak only partially to his connection to young people			0
the surge of young voters who came to the polls in record numbers last year were n't just voting for a candidate			2
nor were they voting for an " issue			2
" they were voting for a political philosophy , culture and core set of values that were overwhelmingly progressive			1
social justice , equality , economic opportunity , accountability , openness of government , inclusiveness -- this was the foundation of the 2008 youth vote mandate			0
it was in this way perhaps , greater than any other , that the current generation of young people identified with and appreciated the work of @entity13			1
beyond his role in advocating policies with clear implications for young people , he consistently exemplified the hope for an open , just and inclusive @entity16 -- the platform that young @entity16 overwhelmingly supported during the election			0
to @entity13 , young @entity16 were n't just young voters			2
we were young citizens , people who deserve equal access to an affordable education , a voice in our nation 's political process			2
he did n't view our concerns and needs as fanciful , impetuous dreams of youth			0
he realized and valued the unique gift that we bring to this country when given the opportunities and access to make our voices heard			0
