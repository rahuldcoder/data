in one month @entity0 will vote in what may be the country 's most competitive and contentious elections yet			1
but this important process will take place in the shadow of a worsening threat -- @entity9 , the @entity10 insurgent group otherwise known as @entity11 , which killed as many as 2,000 people in the northeastern town of @entity14 on january 3			1
the attacks of the past few weeks -- @entity9 's biggest ever in terms of casualties on @entity14 , and on markets using children to detonate devices -- have drawn international focus back to the crisis			1
but such appalling events are not new -- they are an intensification , a next step in a crisis which has steadily worsened since @entity9 's 2010 reemergence			2
and they raise a number of questions about the trajectory of the insurgency and the response to it			0
why did @entity9 take @entity14 now ? for @entity9 , taking @entity14 -- a small town in @entity0 's @entity35 -- closes a gap in its map , fulfills a strategic purpose with its proximity to the border with @entity41 , where it is reported to have set up camps on islands in @entity41 , and further bolsters its resources and sense of confidence with a win over a multinational military force			1
the small town near @entity41 was home to the base of the @entity53 , comprising troops from @entity0 , @entity55 and @entity41 -- but despite the military presence , @entity14 was surrounded in the country 's northeastern corner by what has become @entity9 territory			1
the most recent attack was not the first fighting @entity14 had seen : in april 2013 nearly 200 people were killed and around 2,000 homes burnt by insurgents and soldiers in attacks and counterattacks , according to @entity69			1
what do latest attacks say about @entity9 's tactics ? the history of @entity9 is one of ever - expanding extremes			1
looking back at the changing situation in the northeast and the nature of @entity9 's targets and scale of its attacks , there are events since 2009 that can be seen as markers in the next stage of its evolution -- from the extrajudicial killing of the movement 's founder @entity89 in 2009 , to the 2011 suicide attack on police headquarters in @entity93 , to the 2013 introduction of the state of emergency in three northeastern states , to last year 's killing of schoolboys and abduction of the @entity101 schoolgirls			1
the scale of the killings in @entity14 and the reported use of children , perhaps as young as ten , to carry and detonate bombs is @entity9 further pushing the boundaries of what it will do			1
the indiscriminate ferocity of its killings is n't necessarily all about tactics			0
there still is n't a clear picture of what happened at @entity14 and who did the killing -- the age , the motivation , the state of mind of what may have been militants , conscripts or armed and terrified child combatants			0
what is clear is that @entity9 kills because it can and because it 's likely those who are not core loyalists or ideologues are expendable resources for the movement			1
whereas previously its attacks had been in revenge for some grievance or focused on the @entity0 state , it has become much harder to explain its targets and identify its endgame			0
is @entity0 doing enough ? the @entity136 of the @entity0 army has been struggling to respond effectively to an insurgency that abducts and uses civilians , that is well equipped with captured military hardware and that knows the terrain of the region better than a federal force which comprises troops unfamiliar with the context , people and language in the northeast			1
the overstretch of this force is showing			0
there are many potential reasons for this overstretch -- from lack of clear directive , to lack of equipment and training			0
many also cite corruption : billions of dollars have been spent as a result of the insurgency , but it is not clear what proportion of this has been spent in or on the fight in @entity35			0
the federal government has been silent on or has had a delayed response to many attacks and key developments during this crisis			0
as criticism increases of the federal government for its handling of the threat , which has gotten worse over the years , a lack of or confused messaging only bolsters perceptions that it sees the situation in the northeast as peripheral or as a conspiracy to discredit president @entity181 and his administration			0
is the international community doing enough ? @entity9 is a @entity0 movement that is mostly targeting @entity0			1
@entity0 's federal government and security agencies have the responsibility for resolving this crisis in cooperation with regional and international actors , who look to the @entity0 government and forces to lead and coordinate			2
@entity0 's international partners offered assistance in training , advice and technical support , and some of this was accepted after the @entity101 abductions of april 2014 and amid the international outcry that followed			2
the international community could do more to speak with one voice and coordinate better amongst itself to galvanize further and faster action in @entity0 , back those agencies and actors which are making progress , and identify gaps for greater support			0
an immediate priority is humanitarian relief and energies need to be focused on how to get essential help to internally displaced people and refugees			0
will the latest attacks affect next month 's election ? the attack in itself is unlikely to have an effect on the outcome of the elections , but security and law and order are a primary concern for all @entity0			2
some voters -- not all -- will assess @entity181 's performance as president since 2011 through his handling of the @entity9 crisis			2
what kind of threat does @entity9 pose regionally now ? despite increased attacks in northern @entity235 and growing concern in southern @entity55 and western @entity41 , it is not clear that @entity9 would seek immediately to open new fronts in this conflict by taking on the armies of @entity41 and @entity55			2
as @entity0 's army pushes back , @entity9 may continue to look across borders for refuge			1
the war economy of the northeast is also poorly understood ; it is possible that these border regions are important in order for @entity9 to sustain itself as the economy in the northeast declines as farming and fishing have become impossible			0
should the @entity252 be worried ? the @entity252 -- and others -- should be worried because of the human cost of the @entity9 crisis and the legacy this violence will leave			0
with a few exceptions , @entity9 has not attacked western targets ; its focus is @entity0			2
but @entity0 is @entity262 's largest economy , democracy and producer of crude oil -- it is important to the stability and economy of the region			0
@entity262 leaders and @entity0 's international partners should also be worried if a more effective response is not forthcoming from @entity0 , and if @entity9 seeks to start pushing south and west in the country			1
in the immediate term , it is crucial that the @entity0 military protects state capitals in the northeast and that @entity0 holds credible elections in a month 's time			2
