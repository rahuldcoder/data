-- it 's an idea that sits uncomfortably with tennis greats @entity2 and @entity4 but for the @entity6 and their clay - court revolution , blue is the new red			1
the 2012 installment of the $ 10.6 million tournament in the @entity12 capital will be the first time an officially sanctioned @entity15 event will be played on a blue clay court -- a departure from the traditional red associated most closely with the @entity19 and @entity19			1
it is the brainchild of @entity21 , a former player who won a @entity19 doubles title in 1970 , who is convinced the switch of colors will benefit the sport 's star players and spectators watching in person and on television			1
the blue clay is made exactly the same way as the red , with specially dyed bricks being ground into tiny fragments , before two different layers are spread over the court			1
@entity38 also pioneered the first blue hard courts and says the switch to blue clay is a logical step			1
" on the blue court , the contrast is much better , " he told @entity0			2
" i 'm sure the spectators are going to say , ' wow , we can see the ball better			2
' it 's proved scientifically the ball and the contrast is at least 15 per cent better on the blue than the red			1
" i spent a lot of time thinking about the game , thinking about how can you be better , not only for the players , who are the most important thing on the court , but also for the viewers			0
" @entity21 's idea has been years in the making and involved prolonged consultation with the men 's @entity15 , the women 's @entity66 and the @entity68			1
the blue clay has been ratified for use in 2012 and could become a permanent feature of the @entity6 if organizers can satisfy the authorities , spectators , television companies and crucially , the players , come may			1
but there must already be some trepidation in @entity6 given that two of the game 's biggest stars , who have a total of 26 grand slams between them , have already registered their skepticism			2
@entity2 tweeted : " it 's a shame because of the history and tradition of this surface			0
i hope i do n't have to play one day on blue grass			0
" @entity4 said : " this is a long story , but i find it sad that you have to play on a surface the players do n't accept			0
i find it sad that a player like @entity2 , at a tournament in his own country , has had to fight against a surface that does not want to play on			0
" but @entity21 is convinced that once the pair have road tested @entity6 's new color scheme , they will be converted			2
he said : " as far as @entity2 and @entity4 , they are great players and great human beings , i respect their opinion but i do n't have to accept everything one player says			0
" this is a sport that is here for 100 years and is hopefully going to go another 100 years , i 'm sure if they are going to play on it they will come to the right conclusion			0
" @entity21 says the new surface has been trialled on players in @entity12 's @entity119 team and two - time major champion @entity120 , all of whom gave the blue clay the green light			1
he said : " we tested this all over three or four years ago and the players all said the clay plays the same only it is different color and you see the ball better			2
" traditionalists are also yet to be swayed by @entity6 's bold declaration that blue is the new red , with many iconic images of past tournaments showing players ' pristine white outfits slowly becoming cloaked in red clay			1
@entity21 acknowledges the cost is almost double that of the red clay but says the extra expense is worth it			2
he also admits improving the experience for television viewers is a major factor in the switch			0
" it 's very difficult to make changes , tennis makes very little change compared to other sports , " @entity21 added			0
" to accept something new it is not easy but once you prove it is going to improve the game , people slowly accept it			0
" we are dependable -- i do n't want to say slaves to television -- but we are dependable on them and having the possibility to improve it for the television is instrumental			0
