-- a glance at some of the @entity4 semifinalists in 1989 -- such as @entity5 , @entity6 , @entity7 and @entity8 -- evokes distant memories of yesteryear but one player from those championships is , remarkably , still playing today : @entity13			1
to illustrate her longevity another way , the @entity14 was still standing when the diminutive @entity17 made her @entity4 debut in june 1989			1
her opponent on the day was another player reminiscent of another era -- @entity21 -- with the @entity23 beating the then 19 - year - old in straight sets in an inauspicious start for the youngster			1
over two decades on , the 42 - year - old has become the oldest player to reach the third round at @entity4 in the @entity31 -- beating the mark held by @entity33 ( 39 years , 362 days ) when knocking out @entity35 's @entity34 6 - 4 7 - 5 on thursday			1
the last time date - @entity13 contested the third round at @entity4 was when she reached her one and only semifinal , where she was beaten by @entity40 -- some 17 years ago			1
her reward is a showdown with world no. 1 @entity43 , who cruised past @entity45 teenager @entity44 in straight sets in round two ( 6 - 3 6 - 2 ) and who was a seven - year - old growing up with dreams of tennis stardom when the @entity17 made her debut			1
" i 'm very happy to be in the third round , especially since i love @entity4 and have many good memories here , " date - @entity13 told reporters after her match			1
" i think it 's amazing			0
at the age of 42 , i can not believe it			0
" this year i skipped a lot of the clay court season so i could focus on the grass			0
and luckily this year i did n't play a seeded player in the first round , because most of the time i did			2
" known simply as date prior to her marriage to @entity71 motor racing driver @entity70 in 2001 , the veteran of the women 's tour knows her continuation at @entity4 wo n't be easy against the five - time champion -- one who has won her last 33 matches			2
" she 's so strong			0
it 's very , very difficult to beat her , " she said			0
" i played with @entity77 here two years ago , but of course there 's a big difference between @entity77 and @entity43			2
" @entity43 has more power and more speed			2
i just need to try my best on the court and we 'll see			0
i hope i can stay on the court more than an hour , an hour and a half			0
" @entity43 herself is full of admiration for a player who quit the sport in 1996 -- only to make her comeback in 2008 at the age of 37 , a time when most professionals have hung up their rackets			1
" i 've never played her but i have so much respect for her , " the defending champion told reporters after her match			0
" i think she 's so inspiring to be playing such high level tennis at her age			0
and she 's a real danger on grass courts - i know that - i will have to be ready			0
" " @entity13 has great hand - eye coordination			2
does n't matter how hard you hit it , she sees the ball and gets it back			0
" she has great hands , a wonderful great volley , comes to the net a lot , and she plays really flat too , so the ball stays really low			0
" should @entity43 beat the second oldest woman to reach the third round of any grand slam in the @entity31 since 45 - year - old @entity119 at the @entity120 , she will be just one victory away from equalling the longest winning streak in women 's singles history -- the 35 straight wins achieved by her sister @entity77 in 2000			1
@entity77 beat date - @entity13 in a three - set epic at @entity4 in 2011 , prompting @entity43 to suggest she will talk to her elder sibling for some tips			1
" i think i lost four years of my life watching that match , " @entity43 added			2
" so i will definitely be talking to @entity77 and figuring out what i can do to do the best that i can			0
" in other matches on a rain - affected thursday , fourth seed @entity133 -- last year 's beaten finalist -- defeated @entity45 's @entity136 6 - 1 6 - 3 to earn a clash against @entity23 @entity138 for a place in the last 16			1
sixth seed @entity140 was another @entity142 to reach the third round as the @entity144 saw off @entity145 6 - 2 1 - 6 6 - 0 , although the @entity35 needed treatment on a back injury			2
also advancing on thursday were former @entity149 champion @entity148 and @entity150 , the big - hitting @entity71 who was n't even born when date - @entity13 first played at @entity4 .			1

@entity13 becomes oldest player to reach third round at @entity4 in @entity31
@entity17 earns first meeting with @entity43 , who beat @entity157 in straight sets
fourth seed @entity160 a comfortable winner against @entity136
