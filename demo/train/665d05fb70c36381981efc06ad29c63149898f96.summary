@entity0 , @entity1 artists in @entity1 are certainly not lacking inspiration			1
whether they draw from their colonial past , independence , or the turbulent years of civil war that followed , many @entity1 have taken to the canvas to express themselves			1
it 's no wonder the @entity1 art scene is taking the world by storm			1
for @entity14 , the 16 - year civil war that ended in 1992 provided not only the muse but the materials for his works			2
his sculptures -- intricate masks , thrones and figurines -- are molded from recovered weaponry and military equipment , namely old landmines , ak - 47s and rocket launchers			0
@entity14 's work was made possible through the efforts of the @entity29 of @entity1 , a group of local churches that launched the " @entity31 into @entity32 " , which offers participants tools and building materials in exchange for recovered weapons			1
" the war is over			0
why do we still need weapons ? let 's destroy ( them )			2
and i 'm glad the government at the time said , ' yes , let 's destroy '			0
" for other artists , like @entity50 -- whose half - mile murals are dotted throughout the landscape of @entity0 , the country 's capital , independence was the spark plug that got him painting			2
in 1975 , when @entity1 became its own country following a decade - long insurrection against @entity58 , the land was covered in debris , and was very much a blank canvas			1
for @entity50 , artwork proved the perfect medium to inform the public			0
" at the time , it was necessary to teach the people what 's going on			0
what is independence ? what is ' @entity1 ' ? it was necessary to teach people , and people [ did n't ] read , so we taught through paintings in the road , " he says , referring to the low literacy rate back then ( literacy has risen to 58.6 % , up from 38.7 % in 1997 , according to @entity73 )			1
like @entity14 , @entity50 's work has achieved international acclaim following an exhibit at the @entity84 's headquarters in 1996			0
since , he 's been shown in countries throughout the world			0
it is a narrative that is becoming popular in the country , which has started to gain a reputation as an incubator of fine arts			0
" there is an artistic movement , " confirms @entity92 , president of @entity0 's @entity93 , a longstanding exhibition space that showcases many of the country 's up - and - coming artists			1
watch : @entity1 's elusive coffee plant more : @entity102 's mythical beasts			2
