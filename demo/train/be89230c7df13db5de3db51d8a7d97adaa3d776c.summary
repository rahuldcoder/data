-- as saber rattling grows over the @entity6 president 's alleged use of chemical weapons against his own people , @entity2 's once high - profile wife , @entity1 , has kept a low profile			1
" she 's just hunkered down in @entity14 , " said @entity10 , a senior fellow with the @entity11 and author of " in the @entity13 : an eyewitness account of @entity17 's @entity16 with @entity6			1
" " she 's standing by her man			2
" that 's where she can be seen in photographs of the @entity22 posted this week on @entity23			1
no images of bloody battle fields mar the view of the president caught in the middle of the civil war			2
instead , photo after photo of the couple show a picture of caring			0
in one , the first lady -- who majored in computer science and @entity38 literature at @entity39 -- wipes away a boy 's tear			2
in another , she is listening intently to a group of women			0
the photos appeared after the president announced this month that he was adding @entity23 to his social media blitz			1
he also has his own @entity49 page and a @entity51 channel			0
a brutal war ? not to hear @entity2 's @entity23 tell it and , judging from the comments , he has fans in @entity6 , @entity56 and @entity57			1
" @entity58 bless you , " " we love you , " and " we want you to win this war " are common comments posted on the images			0
but not all the remarks are positive			0
" this is not the real @entity6 , " one writer posts			1
" show as the actual @entity6 , please			1
" the only reference to the war that has killed more than 100,000 @entity6 , according to the @entity69 , comes in captions beneath photos of the president shaking hands with soldiers " protecting civilians " and " regaining security and stability " in @entity78			1
the rest of august , according to the account , has been packed with diplomatic functions , awards ceremonies and @entity1 tossing salad , stirring pots and filling bowls as @entity86 broke fast during the holy month of @entity87			1
some of the president 's almost 34,000 @entity23 followers seem to sense spin in the postings , with one asking of the fashion - conscious first lady , " so she managed to find time to stop shopping for shoes ? " and another demanding photos of her @entity95 , the brand of @entity38 shoes that can command $ 1,000 a pair			1
almost as common as the comments asserting , " what a load of bs this account is " are followers offering warm wishes of " @entity58 bless you , " " we love you " and " we want you to win this war			0
" some supporters used a " @entity113 " hashtag			0
western intervention looms in @entity6 the president , who also has a @entity49 page and a @entity51 channel , began posting the photos july 24			1
" they 're pretty standard , " @entity10 said wednesday in a telephone interview about the propaganda tools			1
" i do n't think there are any surprises there			0
" but @entity10 , who once lived in @entity6 and interacted with the first family , said he had little insight into her current doings			1
" we broke relations a long time ago , " he said about the 38 - year - old former investment banker with @entity130 , who was born in @entity131 to a family of @entity6 descent			2
when @entity136 met @entity2 during the 1990s , he was studying in @entity137 to be an eye doctor			2
after the death of her beau 's father , @entity6 president @entity141 , in june 2000 , the ophthalmologist became president and , that december , the couple married			1
since then , they have had at least three children			0
she was reported last spring to be pregnant with a fourth			0
before the outbreak of the civil war in @entity6 in march 2011 , the first lady had projected an image of a reformer			2
local merchants routinely praised the secular " modern image " of @entity2 and his wife , particularly in contrast to @entity57 's pious @entity157 prime minister , @entity156 , whose wife wears an @entity160 headscarf			2
a 2011 @entity164 article described her as " a rose in the desert			0
" the story , which was published after the uprising had begun , was ridiculed for being tone - deaf to suffering in the country			0
though the @entity174 placed @entity136 and members of her family under sanctions shortly after the article was published , the story presented her as she had worked to be perceived -- as an exceptionally modern woman in the @entity181 world , @entity10 and other experts have said			1
unlike other first ladies in the region , she seemed intent on speaking from a position of power and influence			0
her focus , she said , was protecting children			0
afterward , the writer of the @entity164 article told @entity0 she felt duped by the first lady when she learned that the @entity6 president 's forces had killed children			1
" i wondered how this @entity197 woman i had met who so believed in the youth of @entity6 could stand by and not do anything , " said @entity195			2
" i fell for the line this woman fed me			0
" throughout her years as first lady , @entity136 has focused on children			2
in a 2009 @entity0 interview , she spoke about the @entity208 - @entity207 conflict , saying that she would not tolerate an oppressive and violent regime			0
she spoke at length about how it broke her heart that children on either side would be caught in the crossfire			0
that led many observers to expect her to condemn the attacks on civilians , many of them children			0
but no such response has emerged			0
getting to know @entity6 's first family in february 2012 , an article published in @entity224 said @entity136 appeared to support her husband , while also seeking dialogue and comfort for the bereaved in the country			1
according to an e-mail sent through an intermediary from @entity136 's office , " the president is the president of @entity6 , not a faction of @entity6 , and the first lady supports him in that role , " the @entity224 reported			1
meanwhile , the little that has emerged about her life has contrasted sharply with the brutality of the civil war that has engulfed the country : leaked e-mails between the president and the first lady showed that she was shopping online for jewelry , art and furniture			0
on the day of a massive @entity248 rally in @entity249 , @entity136 e-mailed a @entity137 art dealer about buying tens of thousands of dollars ' worth of art. analysis : for @entity253 , @entity6 is truly a problem from hell @entity0 's @entity256 and @entity257 contributed to this report			1

" she 's just hunkered down in @entity14 , " says @entity10 , expert on @entity6
happy images on @entity23 account contrast with harsh reality on the ground
@entity136 is seen at diplomatic functions , awards ceremonies and stirring pots
