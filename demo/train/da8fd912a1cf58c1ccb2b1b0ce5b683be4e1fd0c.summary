-- there 's great potential in the field of regenerative medicine , but doctors caution against seeking experimental treatments in an unregulated environment			2
having had three surgeries for a neck injury already , @entity9 quarterback @entity8 reportedly took a private jet to @entity13 to get a stem cell treatment that is not approved in the @entity15			1
the therapy involved injecting fat cells from @entity8 's body into his neck , according to @entity20			2
@entity9 head coach @entity21 declined to discuss @entity8 's health situation when asked about the stem cell treatment at a press conference monday			1
further details of @entity8 's treatment are not available			2
discussing the choice to go abroad for stem cell treatments puts researchers in an awkward position , because the therapies offered abroad are unregulated and not confirmed to work , but they are based on concepts that the @entity15 medical community believes have potential			1
generally , however , the consensus is that patients should not try to seek experimental stem cell treatments elsewhere , as there 's no telling if they will work or have serious side effects			1
" we believe that there is merit to this approach , we just want to see it ( carried out ) well , ethically and rigorously , " said dr. @entity41 , director of the @entity42 at the @entity44 's @entity43			0
scientists like @entity41 are trying to gather medical evidence through clinical trials to ensure that these treatments are safe and effective			0
leaving the country to seek experimental treatments abroad is common , experts say , although no one has exact numbers for how many people seek stem cell treatments in other countries			1
medical tourism as an industry is projected to grow 35 % annually , and could reach 1.6 million @entity15 patients going elsewhere for treatments by 2012 , according to the @entity66			1
( the agency had previously predicted 6 million by 2010 , but those numbers have not panned out			0
) besides orthopedic injuries like @entity8 's , there are stem cell therapies available elsewhere aimed at heart disease and neurological conditions , even autism			1
@entity74 , @entity75 and @entity76 are all popular countries for seeking these kinds of treatments , @entity41 said			0
the basic idea is that stem cells have regenerative potential , and can even form new tissues			0
mesenchymal stem cells are a particular kind that can become a variety of cell types , including bone cells and cartilage cells			0
while there is a lot of exciting research going on in the field of stem cells , the results are n't all good			0
a 2009 study in the journal @entity98 documented the case of an @entity101 boy who had gone to @entity102 to get fetal stem cells injected into his brain and spinal cord			0
he developed a brain tumor , apparently as a result of the treatment , although the tumor was slow - growing and benign			0
and earlier this year , authorities closed down a large stem cell clinic in @entity74 called the @entity112 , which had operated through a loophole in the country 's regulations regarding unapproved experimental treatments			1
the clinic had been implicated in the death of an 18 - month - old boy after a stem cell treatment ; a 10 - year - old almost died after receiving something similar			2
one problem with going abroad for these unapproved treatments is that there 's no follow - up ; you wo n't have anyone back home to take care of any complications that might result , @entity41 said			2
in cardiac stem cell trials conducted in this country in people with advanced heart disease , medical professionals do follow up with patients and treat any complications that may arise			1
another concern is that , without proper regulation , any given stem cell therapy abroad may actually be different every time you receive a treatment , said @entity145 , director of the @entity146 and @entity148 - @entity147 at @entity149 in @entity150 , @entity151			1
there also may not be any regulations on the quality of the treatment , so you really do n't know what you 're getting , he said			0
" regulatory agencies such as the @entity158 can ensure that cell therapy that reaches patients is safe , effective , and that quality control is established for isolating the cells , manipulating them outside of the body , and delivering them , " @entity145 said			2
a lot of parents believe that stem cell therapies could help their children with autism , although there have n't been any clinical trials in the @entity15 to substantiate this , @entity41 said			1
in orthopedics and cardiology , on the other hand , there are ongoing investigations ; someone like @entity8 could have potentially joined a clinical trial instead of going abroad , although there 's no guarantee that he would have received the treatment rather than a placebo			0
the idea of placebo also comes into play here , as with any therapy -- sometimes , just believing strongly that a treatment will heal you actually does change your body , even if that " treatment " is n't actually doing anything			0
but there are still significant risks from anything that 's unregulated , @entity145 said			0
" while stem cell treatments have been shown to have significant placebo effects during controlled clinical trials , i think patients considering unregulated stem cell treatments need to be aware that they are not optimized and may even do harm , " he said .			1
