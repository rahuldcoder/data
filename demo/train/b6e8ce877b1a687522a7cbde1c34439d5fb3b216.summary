-- a federal judge is once again weighing arguments over the " show me your papers " provision in @entity7 's controversial immigration law			1
the provision was the only one of four major parts of the law upheld by the @entity12 @entity11 in june			2
but opponents argued in @entity14 on tuesday that new evidence shows that a federal judge should block enforcement of the provision			0
" it is infected with racial discrimination , " attorney @entity19 of the @entity20 said outside the courthouse tuesday , according to @entity0 affiliate @entity22			1
court issues split decision on state laws attorney @entity28 , representing @entity7 , argued that the law does not discriminate			1
" you just ca n't say that @entity31 are going to be primarily impacted and that 's discriminatory , " he told @entity0			0
outside the courthouse tuesday , @entity28 told reporters , " if @entity36 happen to be the people who are the highest percentage who come across the border illegally , believe it or not , they 're probably the highest percentage that will be prosecuted under the statute			0
" the " show me your papers " provision allows local law enforcement , when performing other state law enforcement functions , to check on the immigration status of those people they stop for another reason			0
@entity11 justices said they upheld that part because it complements existing federal policy			0
when it upheld the provision , the @entity11 was careful to say that depending on how this is implemented , it could very well be overturned one day			0
immigrants line up for deportation relief on tuesday , the @entity20 and the @entity58 were among the groups to challenge this part of the law on what they said were new grounds			1
as part of their argument , they pointed to e-mails from @entity7 sen. @entity68 , a @entity69 who authored @entity70 and then was ousted from office in a recall election in his suburban @entity74 district last year			1
" it 's very clear that they were pushing the implementation of @entity70 , and they have racially discriminatory motivations for doing so , " said @entity75 , executive director at the @entity58 of @entity7			1
" race , ethnicity and stereotypes about @entity31 were the driving force behind the passage of @entity70			0
" attorneys representing @entity7 dispute that claim			1
" you look at the legislative record , and there were a lot of very good legislators involved from both parties			0
... there was nothing in there dealing with trying to discriminate against @entity36			0
they were talking about illegal immigrants and they were trying to deal with illegal immigrants , " @entity28 told @entity0 wednesday			1
five things to know about immigration @entity68 has contended that dozens of other states are trying to pass similar legislation , showing the popular support and need for such measures			0
in june , he said that accusations of possible racial profiling as a result of the law were " demeaning to law enforcement			2
" " there 's a lot of very professional , qualified law enforcement officers			2
who have been stopping people for crimes and making determinations that there 's a reasonable suspicion that they were illegal , " @entity28 said			2
" they 've been doing that for years , and there 's hardly any record of any racial profiling , and why would one suddenly suspect that they 've got to do that now ? " the civil rights organizations presented three new arguments against the @entity7 law tuesday , @entity19 said			1
the first was that the provision should be blocked because it would result in unconstitutional detainment under the @entity134 , which protects against unreasonable searches and seizures			0
@entity137 has its own immigration problem the opponents of the law also argued that the provision is inappropriately motivated by race , violating equal protection laws , she said			2
finally , @entity19 said , the civil rights groups presented new evidence that the provision encroaches on the federal government 's responsibilities to enforce immigration laws			1
attorneys representing @entity7 have argued in court filings that the civil rights ' organizations evidence was " entirely speculative " and that " evidence demonstrates that ( the provision ) can and will be implemented in a constitutional manner			1
" in court tuesday , @entity12 district judge @entity160 did not indicate when she would rule in the case , attorneys said .			0
