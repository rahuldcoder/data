-- there 's another casting rumor going around about " @entity3 , " and this one is a doozy			1
according to @entity7 , @entity6 is said to be in negotiations to land the role of @entity10 in the upcoming movie , which is based on the @entity13 series			1
studio @entity14 , which shares a parent company with @entity0 , has already announced some of " @entity3 's " cast			1
@entity18 will play the @entity19 , @entity20 will portray @entity21 , and @entity22 has been cast as the @entity19 's girlfriend , @entity24			1
@entity18 is @entity19 , @entity20 is @entity21 in ' @entity3 ' one lingering casting announcement is that of @entity26 , the government agent who heads up " @entity3 's " team of villainous antiheroes			2
@entity29 has long been thought of as a contender for the role , along with @entity32 and @entity33			2
should @entity29 be made an official member of the cast , she 'll have to clear room in an already packed schedule			2
in addition to appearing in two dramatic films slated for release in 2015 , she 's also now the star of @entity43 's hit drama " how to get away with murder " -- a show that 's given @entity29 the kind of meaty leading role she 'd been waiting for			1
" i have been given a lot of roles that are downtrodden , mammy - ish , " @entity29 told the @entity49 in september			0
" a lot of lawyers or doctors who have names but absolutely no lives			0
you 're going to get your three or four scenes , you 're not going to be able to show what you can do			0
you 're going to get your little bitty paycheck , and then you 're going to be hungry for your next role , which is going to be absolutely the same			0
" if nothing else , playing @entity10 would definitely be a change of pace			1
in addition to @entity18 , @entity20 and @entity67 , " @entity3 " also stars @entity68 as @entity69 , @entity70 as @entity71 and @entity72 as @entity73			0
the movie 's scheduled to arrive in theaters on august 5 , 2016 .			0
