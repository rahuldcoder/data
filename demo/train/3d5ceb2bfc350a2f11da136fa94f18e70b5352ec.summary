every day in his cell in one of the most notorious prisons in @entity5 , an @entity1 father wrote a letter to his little boy			1
@entity8 would tuck the papers away , trying to fight the fear that his son might grow up never knowing his dad			1
" @entity13 was my sunshine			0
when i was in there -- it was dark ... it was so ... hard ... i just imagined i could see him , " @entity8 told @entity20 on monday night via phone from @entity22			1
@entity8 seemed to choke up a little			1
after all , he was speaking less than two days after gaining the freedom he thought he 'd never have again -- the result of a @entity28 court system ruling last week that his conviction could not stand			1
@entity8 took a breath and laughed			1
he lovingly shushed the loud giggles of his 5 - year - old			2
" come on , play ! " the boy said as he tugged at his father			0
@entity35 , from @entity36 , had been behind bars since november 2010 , when @entity28 authorities raided his real estate office in the coastal tourist city of @entity41 and accused him of money laundering , drug trafficking and involvement in organized crime			1
he was sentenced to 22 years in august 2011			1
@entity8 survived " day by day , minute by minute , " he told @entity20 's @entity46 in an exclusive interview monday night			1
" it 's a fight for your life every second of the day , " he said			2
for nearly two years , a chorus of supporters -- including a former @entity55 agent , a @entity1 congressman and several noted human rights attorneys -- fought to clear @entity8 's name			1
they said that there was no evidence to support the charges and that the @entity1 's prosecution was rife with legal mistakes and misconduct			1
read the details of @entity35 's case earlier this summer , @entity35 's defense team presented their arguments before an appeals court in @entity28 , which decided last week to vacate all charges against him			1
one of @entity8 's attorneys picked him up from the notorious @entity76 prison near @entity77 late last week and drove him out of the gates			1
@entity8 immediately took a hot shower , and then another and another			1
the prison is notorious for its harsh treatment of inmates and for housing some of the region 's most violent criminals			1
@entity8 said he had been beaten and been refused water and food for days at a time and had developed a painful inflammation in his bowels and lost a lot of weight			1
@entity8 talked about the experience with @entity46 on monday night			1
" it is a notorious prison -- just the conditions and overcrowding of it and the danger of it			2
what is that first moment like when the gate slams behind you and you realize the reality of where you are ? " @entity46 asked			0
" i was with rapists , murderers and actual drug dealers , " @entity8 said			1
" it 's a very violent place			2
there 's a lot of tension between different groups in there ; not only the conditions , but the other people around you			2
" there were times , in the beginning , when @entity8 just could n't believe what was happening to him			1
" i did n't believe that i was there , and i kept thinking to myself , ' oh this is just a big mistake ' and that they will let me go any day now , " he said			0
" and the whole time , ' oh yeah , any day now i should be going , ' and it just kept dragging on and dragging on			0
" what is it like being a free man ? " it 's wonderful ... it 's very overwhelming , " @entity8 said			1
" but i 'm happy to be back with my family my wife and my son			0
... it 's still very , very surreal			0
the whole experience has been very unbelievable			1
" he said that his sister @entity136 , a @entity137 lawyer who was his biggest advocate , sometimes was able to visit him in prison			0
she brought stacks of supportive e-mails			0
they were from friends and family but also from strangers who heard about his case through the awareness group @entity147 , which publicized his case			0
the e-mails were a huge help , but " there were days where i started losing hope , " he said			0
" it 's a very negative environment , that prison			1
" @entity35 meditated on his son			0
he thought about his @entity28 wife @entity156			2
they met not long after he moved from @entity36 to the country , first to work as a @entity160 volunteer and then as a real estate agent			0
the couple settled in @entity41 , a popular beach town in southwest @entity28			2
on november 11 , 2010 , @entity28 police raided @entity35 's @entity165 office and his home			1
police also took custody of @entity35 's truck and the clothes he was wearing ; yet 48 hours after he was detained , police asked him to put his clothes back on and get into his truck so authorities could take pictures , according to former @entity55 agent @entity174 , who has reviewed the case documents			0
he said police then claimed they found a substance that could be cocaine			0
" basic chain of command was not followed , " @entity174 , part of a group of vocal supporters , told @entity20 in february			2
" you can imagine you feel greatly violated that you are being accused of these horrific crimes with absolutely no evidence , " @entity8 told @entity46			2
" but i just did n't believe that those things can happen			0
you do n't think that it can happen to you			0
" by late monday night , @entity8 was exhausted			2
he kept playing with @entity13 , though			0
he still has all those papers , the life lessons he wrote for his son			0
" i want to turn them into a book for him , " he told @entity20			2
" i want him to be able to keep it			0
" he still loves @entity28 , he said			2
he does n't blame a country for the acts of a few people			0
he plans to go to graduate school to get a degree in sustainable urban development to do what he began in the @entity160 years ago			0
" i still do love @entity28			2
i still believe in its potential			0
i still love the people there , " he said			0
" there 's wrongful convictions in every country around the world , including the @entity1 , so i ca n't isolate it just to @entity28			1
and i hope that one day that i 'll be able to finish some of the social projects that i was working on			0
