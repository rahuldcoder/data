-- @entity1 , say hundreds of thousands of people			2
pollution , say hundreds of thousands of others			2
they say that 's what a proposed oil pipeline would bring into the country , as it transports crude from massive deposits in @entity13 tar sands to refineries and ports in the @entity16			1
the @entity18 pipeline has triggered a gush of comments from @entity16 for and against its construction			1
the @entity23 in @entity24 has received 1.2 million since early march , when it came out in support of the project			1
it began publishing them on its website thursday			2
the first 100,000 appeared this week , and the department plans to publish a similar number of comments every week , according to a statement			1
the comments are directed at a document the @entity23 published in march to justify its approval of the @entity18 in light of what it considered environmentally sound planning			1
the @entity40 strongly disagreed and batted down @entity23 's draft @entity42 , giving it the equivalent of a " c - " grade as an environmental document			2
environmentally concerned citizens have piled in on top of the guardians of @entity16 's ecology and appear to have turned in most of the comments arriving at the @entity23			1
citizens highlighting the possible economic benefits have joined the fight , siding with the pipeline 's proponents			1
@entity56 's rock and hard place the politics of oil , jobs and ecology have put president @entity56 between a rock and hard place , as the ultimate decision to permit the @entity18 's construction rests on his shoulders alone			1
proponents of the @entity18 , many of them @entity69 lawmakers the president is seeking compromises from , say it will give @entity16 energy independence , thousands of jobs and important industrial infrastructure , and wo n't cost taxpayers a dime			1
among its detractors are some of @entity56 's traditional allies , who were instrumental in getting him elected			1
they say the massive pipe is dangerous , inherently filthy and must be stopped			2
@entity23 vs. @entity40 in its lengthy study , the @entity23 , headed by @entity84 , weighed in on the side of the proponents			1
but after reviewing it , the @entity40 sent a letter to high officials at the @entity23 , blasting the environmental impact statement			1
the environmental agency rated it as @entity93 - 2 , a bureaucratic moniker for " @entity96 - @entity95 , " a below - average grade on the @entity40 's scale			0
the @entity13 crude in its raw form is mixed with sand			0
extracting the oil and transporting it requires more energy than pumping crude out of a well			0
thrusting it through long pipes increases the energy consumption			0
that higher energy use leads to greater greenhouse gas emissions , an increase of " 18.7 million metric tons ( 20 million tons ) c02 ... per year when compared to an equal amount of @entity16 average crudes , " the @entity40 said			1
the @entity23 's assessment concludes that just as much @entity13 oil will make it to market , by train if necessary , if no pipeline is built , therefore there would be little additional ecological impact			2
the @entity40 argued that " while informative , " that train of thought is out of date			0
@entity125 comes public opinion many of the @entity16 citizens ' comments arriving at the @entity23 are duplicated form letters sent or signed by multiple commenters			1
they are associated with organizations that usually propagate one of two polarized arguments			0
in its form letters , members of the group @entity136 bemoan " the killing a vast forests , to the contamination of terrestrial , aquatic , and atmospheric ecosystems which we all depend on			0
" but like most of the ecological protesters , it drives home the aspect of climate change , caused by " a new super greenhouse gasoline			0
" additional boosts to climate change also make up the core of the @entity40 's objections			0
form letters from proponent groups counter with arguments of economic urgency			0
" ... approve this project			0
@entity18 will ensure @entity16 energy security and create jobs and economic opportunity in @entity158			1
" @entity56 's own former deputy press secretary is leading the charge to push the president to stop the pipeline			1
@entity163 quit his job before the 2012 election to head up the super @entity166 , which worked for the president 's re-election			2
in january , he joined the pr firm @entity169 as an executive vice president			2
he is now representing a new coalition , " @entity172 , no reward , " which opposes @entity18			1
it goes after the additional greenhouse gases but also showcases the damage to @entity16 in the heartland caused by spills			0
@entity56 must decide @entity56 has promised to decide soon on whether or not to allow the @entity179 oil company to lay the 835 - mile long @entity18 from @entity180 , @entity13 , to @entity181 , @entity158			1
the @entity18 would pump 830,000 barrels of oil sands crude per day through @entity16 's heartland , connecting crude producers in @entity13 with refineries and shipping companies in the @entity16			1
@entity179 would cover all the costs , proponents argue , making it practically a gift to the @entity16 oil infrastructure			2
on its way to @entity158 , where it would connect with other , already existing pipelines , @entity18 would pick up additional oil produced in @entity195 and @entity196 and stream it south , @entity179 said on its website			1
it would reduce " @entity16 dependence on oil from @entity200 and the @entity201 by up to 40 percent , " @entity179 extols			0
but the @entity40 is also concerned about oil spills , particularly since sands crude is different from conventional crude			0
it cites a 2010 pipe break in @entity206 , which spurted out 20,000 barrels of sands crude			0
some of it sank to the bottom of the @entity210 and could not be completely cleaned up in three years ' time , the @entity40 said			0
" spills of diluted bitumen may require different response actions or equipment , " the letter stated			0
" these spills can also have different impacts than spills of conventional oil			0
" @entity221 's response the @entity23 's assessment represents its second go - round with the @entity13 company			0
it originally rejected a permit from @entity179 , last year , over the proposed route through @entity158			0
@entity179 came up with a new route that the @entity23 approved of , but the @entity40 says it misses the mark			0
@entity158 's @entity229 gov. @entity229 has approved the project , and @entity16 rep. @entity231 , @entity158 , has called for the @entity18 's construction in a @entity69 radio address			1
the pipeline " is primed to give our economy a shot in the arm and make energy more affordable -- and it wo n't cost the taxpayers a dime , " he argued			2
@entity231 spoke a day after an apparent pipeline rupture in the @entity244 town of @entity245 in late march , about 20 miles north of @entity246			2
black torrents of diluted bitumen flowed through the community , forcing the evacuation of 22 homes .			0

the president has faced high political pressure on the @entity18 pipeline
now the public joins in on both sides , with 1.2 million comments so far
proponents **include** *republicans* whom @entity56 seeks compromise with
*opponents* **include** many who helped elect him president
