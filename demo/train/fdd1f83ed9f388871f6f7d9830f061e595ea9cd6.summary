@entity0 -- if you 're a tourist arriving in @entity3 , you might be asked to give authorities a look at your personal e-mail , in addition to your travel documents			2
@entity3 's attorney general said wednesday that @entity10 , the country 's internal security force , can search a foreign traveler 's e-mail , but only in exceptional cases in which " relevant suspicious signs " are observed			1
@entity3 says the practice is another way to fight terrorism			2
the threat of using foreign citizens for terrorist purposes is a growing trend , the @entity3 attorney general 's office said in a written response to an inquiry filed by an @entity3 human rights group			1
@entity28 , a spokesman for @entity3 's @entity30 , told @entity1 : " security may under the law demand this , but no one is forced to open their accounts to anyone they do n't want to			1
" however , the attorney general 's decision said that if the traveler declined to give consent , it would be made clear that a refusal would be taken into consideration , along with other relevant factors , in deciding whether to allow entry into @entity3			1
the @entity47 received the information from the attorney general 's office after it asked whether @entity3 's security forces could demand travelers ' e-mail and social media passwords			1
the association said the question was a reaction to media reports last year that several @entity60 - @entity59 travelers were asked to open their e-mail accounts and show airport security before being denied entry			2
the group received an answer this week			0
" to be clear , this is a process whose execution is conditioned on the receipt of the passenger 's agreement , and that the latter is not required to give the investigating representative his password , as your letter suggests , but rather that the passenger himself executes entry to the e-mail account ... " the attorney general 's office wrote			1
@entity82 , an attorney for the @entity47 , said the practice is a violation of privacy rights : " a tourist who has just spent thousands of dollars to travel to @entity3 , only to be interrogated at the airport by @entity10 agents and told to grant access to their e-mail account , is in no position to give free and informed consent , " she said wednesday			1
" such ' consent , ' given under threat of deportation , can not serve as a basis for such a drastic invasion of privacy			2
in today 's world , access to a person 's e-mail account is akin to access to their innermost thoughts and personal lives			0
allowing security agents to take such invasive measures at their own discretion and on the basis of such flimsy ' consent ' is not befitting of a democracy			0
" security checks at @entity114 's @entity113 are known around the world as some of the most exhaustive and thorough , and this is one more layer that travelers should be aware of			0
@entity121 owner @entity120 said she had heard of the practice but her clients had not experienced it : " none of our clients have faced this problem yet			0
they come with official groups with their vouchers , and no one asks them about these things			0
however , if we do receive any groups with some people who are originally from @entity138 or from @entity139 , they are detained for several hours and asked to sign a paper not to cause any harm to the state of @entity3 during their visit			0
" critics of the practice worry it will be used to target @entity148 or @entity149 who communicate with @entity60 activists or organizations .			0
