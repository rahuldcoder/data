" for anybody being involved in a criminal case in @entity6 , the first 96 hours ... those first 96 hours are crucial , " @entity11 said			1
" a lot can be done , and releases can and are obtained regularly , but you have to aggressively address a defensive strategy			0
" now , @entity11 says , his client is at the mercy of the @entity6 judicial system , and there is no timetable for his release			1
@entity12 has maintained that he took a wrong turn on the @entity33 side of the border into @entity35 , @entity6 , the night of march 31			1

he was detained by @entity6 border officials for possessing a .45 - caliber pistol , a 12 - gauge pump shotgun and an ar - 15 rifle			1
for weeks , @entity12 sat in a @entity35 prison while his defense attorneys failed to submit evidence to the court in the initial stages of his defense			2
@entity12 and his attorneys alleged that he was beaten and tortured by guards and prisoners at the prison			2
@entity6 officials have denied that claim			2
he has since been transferred to @entity58 in @entity59 , where he told @entity0 earlier this month that he is being treated well			0

i would have loved to have taken advantage of those opportunities			0
but now we need to work with what we have and that 's exactly what we 're going to do			0
" @entity74 to @entity12 's defense is that @entity12 's rights were violated under the @entity6 constitution , @entity11 said			1
" i believe he was denied several basic human rights , which , it 's my contention , should result in reparation from the court " in the form of declaring a mistrial or tossing out the testimony " of those officers who are singling him out as the responsible party in this case			1
" a 20 - year criminal defense veteran , @entity11 said he has a strong track record of acquittals or cases being thrown out in federal court			2
