so , you got a drone for @entity2 , huh ? you could be among thousands -- potentially tens of thousands -- of new drone users after this holiday season , according to industry leaders			0
once you 've unpacked your high - tech gift , you should probably read up on the @entity9 's guidelines to make sure you avoid nearly colliding with a @entity10 or slicing someone 's face at a @entity13 friday 's			1
yes , both have happened			0
three drone associations partnered with the @entity9 this month to spread the word about the guidelines to safely operate drones -- the @entity19 campaign			1
but since we both know there 's a good chance you could find a way to get into your own kind of trouble , we 've boiled down the must - knows right here : 1			0
do n't use your camera - equipped drone to get a closer look at airplanes in mid-air			2
it 's illegal for recreational drones to be flown higher than 400 feet or within 5 miles of an airport			0
the @entity9 has already recorded 25 incidents when small drones got too close for comfort with manned aircrafts			1
pilots have also reported unmanned aerial vehicles , or @entity42 , several thousands of feet in the air , sometimes coming within just a few dozen feet of their aircraft , according to @entity9 data			2
and drones could do serious damage			0
remember when a plane was forced to miraculously land on the @entity50 after hitting at least one bird ? now , replace that bird with a drone			0
headed to the game ? leave the drone at home			0
you might be tempted to send your quadcopter above the field to get an aerial view , but remember there 's always the @entity62			0
the @entity9 advises drone pilots to keep their crafts away from large crowds and out of stadiums and racetracks			1
the blades on some drones can seriously injure , like when a mistletoe marketing gimmick that involved a drone inside a @entity13 friday 's went wrong , cutting a photographer			0
and you definitely want to keep your drone away from power lines			1
the @entity9 warns users to keep their drones away from " power stations , water treatment facilities , correctional facilities , heavily traveled roadways , government facilities , etc. " earlier this month an @entity84 man literally crashed a nine - hour police operation , almost hitting one of the police officers , after his drone got tangled in power lines , @entity82 reported			1
anyway , that should n't happen as long as you keep your drone within your line of sight at all times , another guideline for drone use			2
making money off your drone without a permit -- illegal			2
the @entity9 needs to ok the commercial use of any drone , whether that 's selling photos or videos , providing security or making a movie using a uav			1
the @entity9 even fined one man $ 10,000 for using a drone to shoot a promotional video			1
do n't be a creep			2
the @entity110 , one of three drone groups collaborating with the @entity9 , advises users not to use drones to photograph people secretly or spy on them			1
sen. @entity117 , @entity118 , is already worried enough about the government using drones to invade people 's privacy without having to worry about civilian and commercial drones peering into people 's windows .			0

a drone is not an *excuse* to get up close and *personal* with an airplane
and the @entity9 does n't want you taking it to stadiums or bringing it close to power lines either
you need to get *authorization* from the @entity9 to make money off your drone
and , please , do n't be a creep
