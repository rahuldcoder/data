-- @entity1 has gone the extra mile as it prepares to host the @entity3 -- golf 's third major of 2013 -- this week			1
the grandstands are proudly in place , the pale greens are shorn and clipped and rakes nestle in the hollows of the bunkers waiting to smooth over sand disheveled by mishit balls			2
but despite all this meticulous preening it is the extra 158 yards that matters most			0
the seaside links course now unravels for 7,192 yards -- when the course was first opened on the @entity19 east coast in 1891 it rolled over a mere 6,200 yards			1
the total yardage for the masters at @entity22 ran to 7,435 , june 's @entity23 at the @entity24 was 6,996 while the next major , the @entity25 , is to be played on the @entity27 course runs a total of 7,134 yards			1
this year new tees have been added on seven of the holes at @entity1 to match the prowess of the game 's big - hitters and extend the overall playing distance for the 142nd @entity3			1
" the changes were made really just to strengthen the course , " @entity35 , the @entity1 course manager , told @entity0			2
" golfers have got better and equipment has got better			0
" a lot of this work was done over a two - to - three year period and we 're now doing the final tweaking to make it look like everything has been here for years			2
" the biggest change , made to spice up golf 's oldest major , lies in wait at the ninth hole			1
previously thought of as short by modern par - five standards , the tee has been moved back almost 50 yards thanks to a land swap with the neighboring @entity56			2
a new bunker has been added to the right of the ninth fairway and the existing sand trap has also been moved closer to the green			1
the sandy , new hazard was carved out with a " big digger " before the soil was put back , contoured and new turf laid down			0
" it gives it a nice finish and you ca n't really see that anything has been there , " said @entity35 , casting a backwards glance at the grassy bumps hiding the scooped out earth			0
" it was quite a wide , open area up here for hitting the second or third approach shot so the changes put a lot more thought to landing on the small green now			0
" a lot of people [ who have tested the new layout ] have found these bunkers very difficult			0
" one of the key areas we 've changed across the course since 2002 is the greenside bunkering			1
we 've brought them in a little bit tighter and made them more gathering for a ball to roll in easier			0
" it is the 16th time that @entity1 has hosted the @entity3 and the first since @entity96 @entity95 triumphed 11 years ago following a dramatic four - man play - off that went to sudden death on the fifth extra hole			1
@entity95 returns to @entity1 as the defending @entity3 champion after another emotional win at @entity102 last year			1
the @entity104 course has attempted to move with the times away from the greens and fairways too by introducing @entity109 zones for spectators around the course as well as led scoreboards			0
a ban on mobile phones was also lifted last year and , as there have been no complaints from the players , spectators will once again be allowed to use them , so long as they " respect the game			1
" but it 's traditions that the @entity19 course prides itself on as well as its knotty rough and brisk coastal breezes			1
when the world 's leading male players return to joust for the honor of winning the @entity128 , the hope is they will find very little has changed on the surface			0
" it 's our duty to keep our famous links course providing the test we need to identify a champion , " said @entity130			0
" @entity1 has always been a very , very strong venue			2
the players love it and they think it 's fair			0
many of the changes you ca n't see and wo n't even know they 've been done			0
" when the players come here they 'll recognize the @entity1 they know and love			2

@entity1 increases total yardage for golf 's big - hitters at the 2013 @entity3
big changes at the ninth hole *include* moving the tee and adding a bunker
there have also been changes to the greenside bunkering to trap balls easier
