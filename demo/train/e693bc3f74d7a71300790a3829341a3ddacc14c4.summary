@entity0 has reunited siblings separated at birth , rekindled old romantic relationships and helped countless people find someone who understands what they are going through			1
and now , the social media platform has helped one @entity10 family find a home for their unused embryos , according to @entity1 affiliate @entity14			1
@entity15 and @entity16 of @entity17 , @entity10 struggled to conceive and turned to in vitro fertilization , which they say blessed them with two sets of twins , ages 3 years old and 16 months			1
the couple was then left with six unused frozen embryos , which they decided to donate and place with the @entity26 in @entity27 , @entity14 reported			1
separated at birth , reunited on @entity0 but two years later , the embryos were still unused and being housed at the donation center			1
" what i did n't realize is that there 's a lot of competition out there , " @entity31 told @entity14 in an interview			0
" that center has over 300 sets " of embryos , she said			2
each set could be anywhere from one embryo to 24 embryos per donor , said @entity46 , marketing and public relations manager for the @entity26			2
" the more restrictions , stipulations that the donors place on the recipients , the longer it 's going to take to find a match , " she said			0
the average wait time for open communications arrangements such as the one @entity16 was seeking , where the donor has contact with the recipient , could be anywhere from six months to four years , she said			2
frustrated and eager to find a home for her embryos , @entity16 went an unconventional route			2
she placed a post on @entity0 , and detailed the kind of family she and her husband were looking for : married several years , in a steady loving relationship , strong @entity70 background , roots in @entity10			1
" and i made sure i let people know , you know , this is not a gimmick , no games , " said @entity16			0
" i 'm not getting any money for this			0
" the @entity16 received hundreds of responses , and in less than three weeks settled on a family : @entity81 and @entity82 of @entity83 , @entity10			1
" we do n't look like what people would statistically say ' oh those people are infertile			0
' we just look like a happy , young married couple , " said @entity88 in an interview with @entity14			2
do n't believe this @entity0 hoax @entity81 said she stumbled upon the post and jumped at the possibility			1
she recently visited with @entity31 and her family			2
" meeting them and seeing their children and seeing how they interact as a family , their interests , just their personalities as a whole , is very similar to my husband and i , " she told @entity14			0
@entity31 said she wants her kids to know the @entity88 family because they will be genetically connected forever			0
" we 'll be meeting them all along so they 'll know us but they wo n't know us as parents , " said @entity16			0
@entity81 , who plans to have two transfers of three embryos each , with the first transfer possibly by may , said she agrees with @entity16 on the importance of an open relationship			1
" those are her babies , and she is giving me that gift , " said @entity88			0
" the least that i can do is let her have a relationship , see those children and have a relationship for her own children 's sake			0
" after @entity124 shock , mom gives birth to two sets of identical twins @entity128 of the @entity26 said there are few laws in most states in the entire country that cover embryo donations in any form			1
" it 's a little bit of uncharted territory , " she said			0
that is why fertility doctors say counseling for anyone going through open donations is crucial so that both families can share their needs , wants and expectations			1
" if it works and people are careful , it will work well , " dr. @entity146 of the @entity147 told @entity14 regarding this unorthodox path of embryo donation			0
" that 's part of our generation and our new age , our ability to communicate and communicate with a wide range of people on our own without having to go through what might be considered normal channels			0
" do you think using @entity0 to find a home for unused embryos is a good idea ? share your thoughts with @entity165 on @entity166 or @entity167 on @entity0 .			1
