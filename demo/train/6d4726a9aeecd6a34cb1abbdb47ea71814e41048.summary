editor 's note : @entity2 , a @entity3 strategist and @entity5 political contributor , was a political consultant for @entity7 's presidential campaign in 1992 and was counselor to @entity7 in the @entity9			1
@entity2 says republicans are failing to respond to the real economic pain felt throughout the @entity12 ( @entity5 ) -- as the fight over president @entity16 's economic recovery package heats up , the two sides are beginning to define themselves with admirable clarity			1
the president says we have a crisis that is heading toward a catastrophe			2
in announcing his new @entity22 , president @entity16 declared , " the situation could not be more serious			2
these [ new unemployment ] numbers demand action			1
it is inexcusable and irresponsible for any of us to get bogged down in distraction , delay , or politics as usual , while millions of @entity12 are being put out of work			2
" the @entity33 , on the other hand , have honed their economic message : @entity35 , delay , do nothing			1
denial it begins with denial			2
former @entity41 adviser @entity40 and @entity43 host @entity42 opined in december that it 's the media 's fault			2
the said the press is overhyping bad news ; the economy , they suggested , is not really all that bad			1
" so you are agreeing with me , " @entity42 said , " that there is a conscious effort on the part of the @entity55 and other liberal media to basically paint as drastic a picture as possible , so that when @entity16 takes office , that anything is better than what we have now ? " " yes , " said mr. @entity40			2
i guess if you 're wealthy like mr. @entity40 and mr. @entity42 you can afford to pretend the recession is a vast media conspiracy			2
but for the 3.7 million @entity12 who have lost their jobs in the @entity41 - @entity33 recession , @entity66			1
@entity40 and @entity42 seem dangerously out of touch			2
delay " let 's slow down			2
let 's take our time , " said sen. @entity69 ( @entity70 )			2
" few things are going to be as important as this			0
" generally that 's good advice			0
but with the economy losing 19,000 jobs a day , is delay really a wise strategy ? sen. @entity81 ( @entity82 ) seems to think so			1
he told @entity5 's @entity83 , " we could shelf this bill and start again			0
that 's what we really need to do			0
" do nothing @entity89 gov. @entity88 is widely considered a rising star in the @entity33			1
he was even mentioned as a potential running mate for 2008 @entity33 presidential nominee @entity92			1
his strategy , again articulated to @entity83 on " @entity94 , " is to do nothing -- let companies , communities and families fail			1
" we 're going to go through a process of deleveraging , " @entity88 said			0
" and it will be painful			0
the question is , do we apply a bunch of different @entity105 that lengthen and prolong this pain or do we take the @entity105 off ? i believe very strongly : let 's get this thing over with , let 's not drag it on			0
" set aside the callousness of @entity88 's metaphor -- that joblessness at the highest level since the @entity116 is somehow like a scratch that does n't even need a @entity105			0
focus instead on @entity88 's substantive message : you 're on your own			0
write if you get work			0
this befits a party which has high - ranking members who deny the effectiveness of the @entity126			0
what 's next , denying that the federal government put a man on the moon ? what bipartisanship ? given the @entity33 's combination of flat - earth economics and scorched - earth politics , it should come as no surprise that it looks like 98.6 percent of @entity137 @entity33 oppose president @entity16 's economic recovery package			1
they either do not understand the depth of the recession or they do not realize the results of the recent election			0
i do n't know what more president @entity16 can do			0
he has named three prominent republicans to his @entity148 ( @entity149 at @entity150 , @entity151 at @entity152 and @entity153 at @entity154 )			1
he has helped persuade @entity156 gov. @entity155 to replace sen. @entity153 with a @entity33			1
he has met behind closed doors with the entire @entity9 and @entity159 @entity33 conferences			1
he has hosted bipartisan cocktail parties , a @entity162 party and -- what 's left , a slumber party ? he has agreed to ditch progressive provisions from the stimulus bill , like support for family planning ( earning him a rebuke from @entity170 ) and accepted more tax cuts than many @entity3 would like			0
ireport.com : share your thoughts on the stimulus package still , there 's bipartisanship and there 's bipartisanship			0
real - world republicans support president @entity16 's recovery plan			1
@entity183 gov. @entity182 is a supporter , and as the ubiquitous @entity83 has reported , the very @entity33 mayor of the very @entity33 town of @entity186 , @entity187 , supports @entity16 's plan as well			1
" @entity190 should be investing in infrastructure , " mayor @entity189 told @entity83			0
" that is what government is meant to do			0
it creates long - term value			0
i think the stimulus plan is a good one			0
" so take heart , mr. president			0
in the real world of layoffs , foreclosures and plant closings , you have the support of both @entity33 and @entity3			1
they agree with you that @entity35 , @entity207 and doing nothing is not an economic strategy			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			1

@entity2 : republicans are adopting strategy of *blocking* action on economy
he says they have denied the extent of the problem and delayed action
@entity223 : some in @entity33 adopt a callous *attitude* that we should do nothing
still , he says , some republicans outside @entity137 see the need to act
