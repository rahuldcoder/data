-- @entity1 knows something about hate			2
she 's seen how hateful words can cause people to demonize their political foes , grab guns and commit murder			1
she 's a survivor of one of the most brutal episodes of the civil rights movement			1
long before the january 8 shootings in @entity13 , @entity14 , sparked debate about the role of heated rhetoric , @entity1 and other civil rights veterans worried about the nation 's recent political tone -- and what it might wreak			1
@entity1 is a former volunteer with the @entity22			2
she was working in an office one summer day in 1964 when she received a call that three civil rights workers were missing			1
the bodies of the murdered men were discovered after a 44 - day search			2
" i knew immediately that they were dead , " @entity1 said			2
" you do n't forget things like that			2
things like that happen when political emotions are heated			0
" there appears to be no direct evidence that politics motivated @entity38 , the man accused of killing six people and wounding 13 -- including rep. @entity40			1
internet postings attributed to @entity38 show what one expert called " classic signs of psychosis			2
" source : provocative @entity38 photo turns up still , lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have called on colleagues to tone down the militant - themed messages and fear - laced speeches that have marked recent dialogue in @entity55 and on the campaign trail			1
for some civil rights veterans , the debate over political rhetoric is n't academic -- it 's personal			1
rep. @entity61 , @entity62 , said the recent political tone " takes me back to that period in the civil rights movement when we were called un-american			1
" @entity61 , who was beaten in @entity66 , @entity67 , while leading a civil rights march , said rhetoric turns dangerous when groups go beyond the war analogies common in political speech and imply their foes are enemies of @entity74			1
during the health care reform debate , some leaders called their foes " un-american " and " socialists , " he says			2
" individuals like gov. @entity82 or @entity83 never threw a bomb or pulled a trigger , but they created the climate for others to throw the bomb and pull the trigger , " @entity61 said , referring to the segregationist @entity67 leader and @entity80 city commissioner			1
both the recent rhetoric and the @entity13 shooting reawakened memories for @entity61 , @entity1 and others from the civil rights era			1
@entity1 said that when she retired to @entity13 , she never expected to experience the dread she once felt as a civil rights worker in @entity97			1
but in recent months , she said she had felt a familiar sense of foreboding			1
she said she saw hundreds of @entity101 members shout down @entity40 at a town hall meeting			0
she saw scores of ordinary @entity104 openly carry guns around town			0
she noted the rising ethnic strife			0
" i told people , this is the new @entity97 , " @entity1 said			0
" this is where the focus of the resurgence of right - wing hostility is located			2
" @entity115 , @entity14 , sheriff @entity116 set off a wave of criticism after the shootings when he made similar comments calling @entity14 a " mecca for prejudice and bigotry " and blaming the news media for spreading " vitriolic rhetoric			2
" a conservative talk show host and a local newspaper were among those who accused the sheriff of becoming part of the problem			0
the @entity115 @entity131 put out a statement calling on " all @entity74 to come together and renounce violence			1
" " there is no place in @entity74 's political debate for acts of violence , " the statement said			1
" while we disagree with congresswoman @entity40 on many things , we pray for her survival and full recovery without reservation or exception			0
" @entity40 upgraded to serious condition @entity146 knows what it 's like to enter a state that 's considered a mecca of bigotry			0
@entity146 is a former " @entity152 , " part of an interracial group of students who tried to desegregate interstate bus travel in 1961 by riding @entity158 buses throughout the @entity159			0
they were savagely beaten by mobs and , in one infamous incident in @entity165 , @entity67 , their bus was torched			0
@entity146 said @entity159 political leaders helped create mobs by demonizing @entity152 in the press and describing their arrival as an " invasion			0
" " words have consequences , " said @entity146 , who will mark the 50th anniversary of the @entity152 this year with his friends			0
" the governor of @entity67 called us outside agitators , communists and race mixers			0
he said the good people of @entity67 would not protect us			0
" @entity146 said political tension has been building since the country elected @entity183 as its first @entity185 - @entity74 president			1
calling @entity183 a socialist and a native of @entity188 and labeling health care reform " @entity190 " can condition some people to see the president and others as part of a new wave of invaders who must be stopped , with violence if necessary , @entity146 said			0
@entity146 said he and other civil rights veterans have been discussing the dangers for some time			1
" in the private conversations in our home , we shuddered at what these kinds of things were leading to , " said @entity146 , who lives in @entity201 , @entity62 , just outside @entity202			0
@entity146 said many of the whites he encountered in the @entity159 during the civil rights movement were angry because they felt integration would cause them to lose their status			1
he said he believes some whites feel the same anxiety today			0
@entity216 , director of the @entity217 at the @entity218 , said contemporary politicians should heed the lessons of history by avoiding language that demonizes their foes			1
if a political leader assassinates a foe 's character , a troubled person might think it 's ok to assassinate the foe , she said			0
but some contemporary politicians forget this lesson from the civil rights era , she said			1
" there 's an historical amnesia because they 're so focused on winning political battles at any cost , " @entity216 said			1
political leaders serving in times of great anxiety face a choice , she said : " the purpose of leadership is not to speak to fears , but to speak to people 's hopes			0
" others argue that political rhetoric has its place in the national debate			2
@entity251 of the @entity253 magazine said the left has deployed the same war - like political rhetoric that it now condemns , noting that president @entity183 once said during his 2008 presidential campaign , " if they bring a knife to the fight , we bring a gun			2
" " strong feelings are a part of political discourse , " @entity251 wrote			0
" this is serious business			0
important things are at stake , including , at times , life and death			0
people have a right to be angry			0
" @entity273 , a political analyst for the @entity276 newspaper , said right - wing politics had nothing to do with the @entity13 shootings			1
" it has become obvious that the murderer was crazy , the follower of no political movement , motivated only by the bizarre ideas ricocheting around his head , " @entity273 wrote			0
opinion : after @entity13 , will media tone it down ? yet sometimes political leaders can make public statements that make them sound unhinged , said one civil rights veteran			1
@entity290 , who was a member of the @entity291 , recalled some of the rhetoric of @entity159 politicians when he participated in a civil rights campaign in @entity66 with the rev. @entity296 in 1965			1
" the politicians were creating a climate of fear and hysteria to get votes , " @entity290 said			2
" they were going around saying that @entity303 blacks had been assigned to rape white women			0
" @entity290 said it 's virtually inevitable that rapid social changes in @entity74 -- electing the first black president , the influx of @entity310 immigrants -- will be accompanied by violence			1
" there is almost always an undercurrent of violence in this country that emerges as a reaction to the advancement of a despised minority 's rights , " @entity290 said			2
that violence does n't have to occur , though , if enough leaders create safe public spaces for varying groups of people to talk to one another , said @entity216			2
@entity216 points to @entity97 as an example			0
she says the once notorious state has more black elected officials than any other			0
civil rights history is taught in its schools , and interracial groups gather to talk about racial progress , she says			1
" if it can happen in @entity97 , it can happen anywhere , " she said			0
she said it happens when @entity74 heed the wisdom of an old adage that declares : " my enemy is someone whose story i have n't heard			1
