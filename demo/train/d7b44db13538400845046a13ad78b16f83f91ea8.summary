" he fooled me and said i 'll do this for you , what a bad husband , i 'll take care of you			2
he was my husband 's cousin , and he said things about my husband			2
" then i realized , when i went to prison , he had a criminal record and that this was his third criminal record			2
and when he said we should kill my husband , i could n't even believe him or that my husband would die			2
i thought he was joking , that he had lost his mind			2
" when my husband 's mother was at our house one day and i went to get her medicine , i saw him there with all the tools he had bought , including electrical tools , wires and gloves			2
