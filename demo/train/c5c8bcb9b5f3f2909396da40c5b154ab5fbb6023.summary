" it 's still a jigsaw puzzle , " said @entity25 , who will be in charge of the recovery operation			1
" we do not know where the recorders might be			2
" @entity12 said she was hopeful the flight data recorder , sometimes called the black box , would be found			1
" the fact that we found various pieces , a lot of pieces of the plane in a quite concentrated area is a good hope for finding the black boxes , but we have no assurance , " she said			2
it is impossible to tell how many bodies remain in the wreck , he added			2
fifty bodies were recovered in previous searches , leaving 178 victims still missing			2
he would not comment on the condition of the bodies , calling it " inappropriate " to discuss			0

" investigators announced sunday that they had found pieces of the @entity93 that disappeared while flying to @entity0 from @entity94			2
after three unsuccessful searches , investigators discovered the wreckage by using " a different calculation based on currents of the sea and what might have happened , " @entity59 , the @entity62 chief , said monday			0
the @entity62 said sunday that a team led by the @entity103 discovered parts during an underwater search operation conducted within the previous 24 hours			0

oxygen masks were not deployed , indicating that the cabin did not depressurize , the agency said in a 2009 report			0
automated messages sent from the plane in the minutes before the crash showed there were problems measuring air speed , investigators have said , though they said that alone was not enough to cause the disaster			0
the area where the plane went down is far out in the @entity125 -- two to four days for ships to reach from the nearest ports in @entity128 or @entity129 in @entity130			1
the underwater terrain is rough , with underwater mountains and valleys , the @entity62 has said .			0
