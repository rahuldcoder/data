-- the man who dominated @entity2 for more than four decades died not far from his birthplace			1
@entity4 was born in the central @entity2 desert south of @entity6 in spring 1942			1
the only surviving son of traditional @entity9 parents , his early schooling centered on religious subjects taught by a local tribal teacher			2

around age 10 , he enrolled in elementary school in @entity6 , where he completed six grades in four years			0
he then enrolled in secondary school in @entity21 , where , for the first time , he had access to @entity25 newspapers and radio broadcasts , notably the " @entity27 " news program from @entity29			0
shortly after he seized power in 1969 , a junior @entity31 diplomat serving as an interpreter for the @entity31 ambassador in @entity34 noted that @entity4 spoke excellent @entity36 , like a @entity38 radio announcer			1
a political activist from the start , @entity4 was expelled from school in @entity21 because he was distributing pamphlets and organizing public protests critical of the ruling monarchy			1
he completed his secondary schooling in @entity46 , and graduated from the @entity47 in 1965			0
convinced that only armed might could force a change in government , he viewed military service not as a career , but as an instrument for socioeconomic and political change			0
in the course of his time at the academy , he created the @entity59 and selected its 12 - member central committee , drawing on contacts made in @entity21 and @entity46			0
the @entity59 overthrew the monarchy in a bloodless coup @entity64 © tat on the night of september 1 , 1969			2
thereafter , the ruling @entity66 depicted itself as a collegial body , but @entity4 was always first among equals , directing events and dictating policy			1
the language of @entity4 and the other council members was the language of @entity25 nationalism , guided by the precepts of the @entity75 and sharia , the traditional code of @entity79 law , and strengthened by the conviction that only the @entity66 spoke for the @entity2 people			1
over time , the @entity4 regime created a unique form of direct democracy consisting of a nationwide system of congresses and committees designed to give the impression the @entity2 people were running the government			1
in fact , @entity4 , the remaining @entity66 members , the @entity59 and revolutionary committees appointed by @entity4 tightly controlled the political system from the start , making all important decisions			2
the functions and activities of the direct democracy system were regulated by law ; however , the activities of the parallel sector directed by @entity4 and his cohorts was not in any way regulated by legal statutes			1
@entity4 was a revolutionary , and initially , his regime pursued a complex , aggressive and often violent foreign policy			2
beginning in the early 1980s , a series of setbacks caused him to rethink failed initiatives , and after 1999 , @entity2 sought to return to the international community			1
the @entity2 agreement to pay $ 2.7 billion to the families of the victims of the @entity115 bombing and its renunciation of weapons of mass destruction marked important steps in the reconciliation process			0
by 2006 , the @entity31 had achieved full commercial and diplomatic relations with @entity2 for the first time in 25 years			0
by any measure , @entity4 's legacy is a negative one			0
politically , he systematically destroyed civil society and banned political parties , leaving the @entity2 people with no experience in democratic government			1
socially , his authoritarian regime violated the most basic human rights , including freedom of speech , assembly and the press			0
economically , he failed to diversify the economy , leaving the country almost totally dependent on income from oil and gas revenues			0
