@entity0 -- for @entity4 vice president @entity3 and many other pro-gun @entity5 , the task is clear : the best way to protect children from becoming victims of a slaughter like the one seen last week in @entity10 , @entity11 , is to make sure every school in @entity5 has " qualified armed security			1
" for president @entity19 , many @entity16 leaders and a slight majority of the @entity5 public , the solution starts with tougher legislation on assault weapons , universal background checks and limits on high - capacity magazines , the first steps needed to begin to make it harder to get at the kinds of firearms that kill thousands of @entity5 each year			1
both sides are so vested in intractable arguments that there is little room for political common ground			2
while both sides share a desire to keep children safe , it 's like they are living in two different worlds			1
on one side , the gun rights advocates argue that a well - armed populace can best defend the innocent			1
they say that if the teachers at @entity48 were armed -- or if there were armed security at the front door -- fewer lives would have been lost			1
on the other side , the gun control advocates are fighting to protect lives by limiting access to guns			1
they say that if the weapons used in the @entity10 massacre were n't so readily available -- there are at least 310 million non-military firearms in the @entity5 today -- then the 27 people who were murdered might still be alive			1
" it 's hard for people to come to the table to at least talk about it , " said @entity59 , dean and professor at the @entity61 at @entity63 's @entity62			0
why would someone own a military - style rifle ? it took the @entity4 -- the nation 's most politically powerful gun lobby that boasts 4.3 million members -- one week and a bizarre press conference - turned - one - way - announcement to do just that			1
where some may have hoped for concessions on the @entity4 's staunch pro-gun , guns - do n't - kill - people - people - kill - people stance , the @entity4 stayed the course , and even doubled down			1
they offered no willingness to consider any of the proposals offered this week to amend gun laws including limiting access to assault weapons , requiring universal background checks , limiting sales at gun shows and increasing the use of trigger locks			2
instead , the group pointed to media sensationalism , violent video games , gun - free zones in schools , the failure to enforce gun laws already on the books , issues with the nation 's mental health system and other societal problems as feeding the spate of gun violence			2
@entity4 clear on gun debate stance : arm schools they then announced a new national program to train and arm thousands of armed security to be stationed at each of the nation 's nearly 100,000 public and 33,000 private schools			1
they point to the fact that @entity48 -- and most other schools in @entity5 -- are considered gun - free zones as a reason why it was easily attacked			1
policies banning guns at schools create a place that " insane killers " consider " the safest place to inflict maximum mayhem with minimum risk , " @entity3 , said friday			0
@entity3 said @entity5 society has left children " utterly defenseless			1
" " the only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun , " he said			2
the organization also indicated that it would push back against a growing legislative movement to introduce or , in some cases , reintroduce gun control legislation			1
" we ca n't lose precious time debating legislation that wo n't work , " @entity3 said			0
the @entity4 's hard line came in stark contrast to president @entity19 's own plan after the @entity10 shooting			1
the list : despite emotions , little happens legislatively after mass shootings @entity19 appealed to the pro-gun lobby who he said " has members who are mothers and fathers " likely impacted by the shooting			1
but then he also invited them to " do some self - reflection			0
" authorities must work to make " access to mental health care at least as easy as access to a gun , " and the country needs to tackle a " culture that all too often glorifies guns and violence , " he said			2
@entity19 tapped vice president @entity162 to lead an administration effort to develop recommendations in january for preventing another tragedy like the @entity10 school shooting			1
" this is not some @entity0 commission			0
this is not something where folks are going to be studying the issue for six months and publishing a report that gets read and then pushed aside , " @entity19 said wednesday			1
" this is a team that has a very specific task to pull together real reforms right now			0
" across the rest of the nation , attitudes about guns appear to be changing			0
a @entity1 / @entity183 poll released wednesday indicated that a slight majority now favor major restrictions on owning guns or an outright ban on gun ownership by ordinary citizens and more than 6 in 10 favor a ban on semi-automatic assault rifles			2
@entity193 : @entity4 member cuts up card in protest forty - three percent said the shootings in @entity11 make them more likely to support gun control laws , a 15 - point increase from january 2011 following the @entity201 gun rampage that wounded @entity5 rep. @entity202			1
half of those questioned said the school shootings have not changed their opinions on gun control , down 19 points from january 2011			1
but there 's an ocean of difference between the two sides , a gulf broadened by heated rhetoric and an almost singular focus on being " right			0
" @entity4 comments draw swift opposition in reactions while gun control advocate @entity221 mayor @entity220 called the @entity4 's stance " a shameful evasion of the crisis facing our country , " gun rights proponent and economist @entity219 applauded the group for " coming out strongly questioning these gun free zones			1
" @entity11 senator - elect @entity231 tweeted his disgust after seeing the @entity4 's statement : " walking out of another funeral and was handed the @entity4 transcript			2
the most revolting , tone deaf statement i 've ever seen , " he said on @entity236			0
former @entity240 and @entity4 supporter @entity239 called the @entity4 's remarks " very haunting and very disturbing			2
" @entity243 gov. @entity242 , considered by some as a potential 2016 @entity240 presidential candidate , also disagreed with the @entity4 's position			2
" you do n't want to make this an armed camp for kids , " he said at an event in @entity248 friday morning			0
" i do n't think that 's a positive example for children			0
we should be able to figure out other ways to enhance safety			0
" the differences both in perspective and approach could n't be more divergent , folks on both sides of the issue point out			0
" i think that people are hard wired differently			0
if you look at the world as a beautiful place and i 'm in the arts , i 'm a composer , i write music , i write poetry , if you believe the world 's a beautiful place , your viewpoint is different than if you feel ' i have to have my guns to protect myself , ' " said @entity265 , 64 , from @entity266 , @entity267 , as he protested outside of the @entity268 just after the @entity4 's press conference			2
that 's exactly the type of rhetoric that baffles @entity283 , who commented on @entity1			0
" i am a gun owner			0
i would be in favor of a ban on assault type weapons , and limiting magazines to a max of 10 rounds			0
it 's the crazies that say ' ban all weapons ' that make me nervous about giving any ground at all , " @entity283 wrote			0
" approach it reasonably , with assurances that you wo n't go bonkers and demand a total ban , and you might make progress			0
approach it just from anger and you will be fought all the way			0
" opinion : madness in the air in @entity0 @entity1 's @entity307 , @entity308 , @entity309 , @entity310 and @entity311 contributed to this report			0

the @entity4 wants to staff every school in @entity5 with " qualified armed security "
@entity19 , @entity16 and others see tougher gun control as the way to limit *future* massacres
while both sides want to keep children safe , it seems they are living in two different worlds
