-- ever since his blistering debut as an angry , disenfranchised ghetto kid in " @entity4 " , @entity1 has gained a reputation for giving the kind of performances it 's hard to ignore			1
@entity1 has won plaudits for his virtuoso turn as a @entity12 gangster in the movie " @entity14			1
" @entity16 and athletic with a menacing pout and searing blue eyes , the @entity12 actor has made his name playing hard - edged , morally compromised , often unlikeable characters			1
away from the onscreen bad boys , he 's one half of @entity12 's most glamorous screen couple			1
his wife , the @entity26 actress @entity25 is a big name in her own right , and has starred in the last two films of the " @entity32 " trilogy as well as acting alongside @entity1 in a number of movies			1
a huge star at home , @entity1 has enjoyed critical success abroad with roles in films like " @entity40 " , @entity42 's 2007 tale about the @entity44 mafia in @entity45 , and is one of only a handful of @entity12 male stars to get parts in @entity50			1
he has enjoyed cameos in " @entity52 " and " @entity57 " as well as voicing the character of @entity54 in the " @entity56 " cartoon			0
that said he 's yet to score a real @entity50 hit in his own right			0
the moment for that may not be far away , especially after his recent virtuoso turn in the @entity12 blockbuster " @entity14 "			1
in the film he plays the real - life @entity12 gangster @entity66			1
his performance helped make the film a huge hit in @entity12 and netted him a best actor @entity72 , the @entity12 equivalent of the @entity74			1
" ( @entity1 ) is viewed in @entity12 as a very good actor with charisma and intelligence , " @entity75 , a @entity45 - based @entity12 film critic told @entity0			1
" like most intelligent actors , he 's politically aware and does n't mince his words			0
" @entity12 's most wanted criminal in the seventies , @entity14 is a controversial figure in his native land			1
a charismatic and psychotic criminal , he courted the press and was known for daring bank heists and prison breaks			0
he was eventually gunned down by police on the streets of @entity91 in 1979			0
the two - part movie -- released in the @entity93 and the @entity94 this month -- is the perfect showcase for @entity1 's muscular brand of acting and pairs him up with the grand old master of @entity12 cinema , @entity99 , who plays the head of @entity14 's band of hoodlums in the film			1
" he 's not yet seen on a par with @entity99 , " said @entity75			0
" not being of a classic beauty , @entity1 belongs to the " gueules cassées " ( which literally means " broken faces " ) such as @entity109 before him			2
it 's @entity12 gallic charm with character			2
" @entity1 's first movie role was in " @entity4 " ( or " hate " in @entity114 ) the 1995 indie hit about a group of youths living on a @entity91 housing estate			1
directed by " @entity121 " star @entity120 , the film stirred controversy because of its stark depiction of racial tensions			0
in it @entity1 plays an angry young boxer with a @entity128 obsession			1
the middle - class son of the popular film actor @entity130 , he was not an obvious choice to play the part of a disenfranchised street kid			2
even so , he made the part his own and still maintains the movie is one of his proudest moments			2
" i love that " @entity4 " is still so accurate , but that also horrifies me , " @entity1 told @entity45 's @entity139 newspaper in an interview earlier this year			2
he told the paper that he did n't think @entity12 was a racist place but that the country still had " many problems with our immigrant past			0
" the 42 - year - old @entity91 did n't rest on his laurels following " @entity4			0
" he made a string of hard - hitting films , the most controversial of which by far was the 2002 movie " @entity151			0
" the film is told backwards and features an excruciating 10 - minute rape scene in which @entity25 , his wife , plays the victim			2
in spite of the raw subject matter , the experience of filming with his wife on " @entity151 " is something @entity1 clearly enjoyed since the two have appeared with each other in eight other movies			0
the golden couple of the @entity165 movie scene have a daughter together but @entity12 's strict privacy laws mean they 're afforded a degree of freedom not always permitted to their @entity50 counterparts			2
" the @entity12 press is famously respectful of personalities ' private lives especially if those celebrities do n't play with the fire of self - seeking publicity , " said @entity75			0
" @entity14 : @entity179 " is in @entity93 cinemas now			0
" @entity14 : @entity180 " is in @entity93 cinemas 28 august			0
