@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 will soon test its third nuclear device			2
earlier tests in 2006 and 2009 drew worldwide condemnation , @entity8 sanctions and led @entity9 to withdraw from the six - party talks			1
in resolution 2087 , passed on january 22 , the @entity8 imposed new sanctions on @entity3 for its december 12 space missile launch and made clear that new violations would be dealt with harshly			1
in response , @entity3 rejected @entity8 legitimacy , asserted their right to nuclear weapons and deterrence and proclaimed it would soon conduct a new nuclear test			1
in addition the @entity22 engaged in some strong saber - rattling aimed at @entity25			0
because some analysts believe this will be a uranium explosion , it is a game - changer for the region and poses new and unfavorable challenges to the @entity8			2
a successful uranium test indicates that @entity9 has advanced centrifuge technologies and related support systems			1
it means that @entity3 , if left unchecked , can both produce and export such material , raising new concerns that @entity9 and @entity38 cooperate in such developments			2
politically the test will reveal that the new regime of @entity42 exceeds the defiance to @entity45 dictates of his predecessors in pursuing his nation 's nuclear goals			2
neither the prospect of stronger sanctions , nor the growing discontent of @entity54 and @entity55 with his behavior , appears to deter @entity3 's young leader			1
opinion : rescind @entity3 's license to provoke these dilemmas confront the permanent five members of the @entity8 with a harsh reality check regarding their unity of action and what message to convey to the north via what particular sanctions			1
if the @entity8 follows the logic of resolution 2087 , it will impose more extensive and punishing sanctions than ever before			0
such sanctions will blacklist companies , government agencies and individuals long known for their role in illicit technology procurement and sanctions evasion			0
they will expand financial sanctions into areas of banking that would require substantial transnational enforcement to bite , and they may call upon countries in the region to inspect almost all @entity3 trade			0
the economic squeeze and further isolation of the @entity3 will increase substantially			0
these sanctions would require @entity55 to play an enforcement role against @entity3 economic actors it has hitherto resisted			1
seizing prohibited goods that pass through @entity97 harbor and other trans - shipment points , as well as shutting down various border activities , would also fall to @entity55			0
these extensive sanctions as punishment operate from the assumption that at some point the north will forego its nuclear program in order to survive as an authoritarian state			2
but there may be an alternative to the punishment approach that could bring @entity111 on board with effective @entity8 action			0
@entity55 might well accept specialized trade sanctions aimed to degrade the @entity3 's ability to sustain the nuclear program for lack of material and due to prohibitive costs of sanctions busting , as a way of conveying to @entity9 that it must return to the negotiating table			1
the logic of extensive new product - focused sanctions is that @entity3 can make -- or jerry - rig -- only a small fraction of the advanced technologies and specialty materials that sustain an ongoing uranium enrichment program			1
to choke off these materials -- and the illicit means of financing them -- provides the @entity8 with a possibility to make it technically impossible for @entity3 to have a functioning uranium - based bomb program			1
@entity138 lists of dozens of the materials used in centrifuge operation that should be sanctioned are already recorded for the @entity8 in the reports of their panel of experts for the @entity3			2
lists of related materials have also been developed by the @entity146			0
to date the permanent five have sanctioned only a very few of the materials on either list			0
@entity150 also needs member states to strengthen export , customs and financial controls on dual - use items that are " below grade " of those newly sanctioned items			0
this will stifle the @entity22 's ability to upgrade or jerry - rig these hitherto unsanctioned items as a way of maintaining their program			1
also critical to the success of this choking of supplies would be stricter controls of the illicit financing that supports such trade			0
putting strong enforcement behind the 2087 resolution 's concern about @entity3 cash flows , especially through its embassies , is also in order			0
another , somewhat unprecedented , sanctions option would be a @entity8 - issued travel ban on @entity3 placed on all scientists , engineers and others with specialized expertise in centrifuge technologies and uranium enrichment			1
political agreement on these measures will not be easy to attain among the permanent five nations of the @entity8			0
but a product - focused sanctions approach -- especially leveraged to aim for more direct diplomatic engagement with the @entity3 while denying them material to grow their illicit programs -- has the best chance of gaining @entity8 consensus			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity198 .			0

@entity198 : uranium - based blast would pose new challenge to @entity8
indicates @entity9 has advanced centrifuge technologies and related systems
@entity3 's young leader appears to care little about what @entity45 or @entity55 think
product - based sanctions may stifle the @entity22 's ability to *continue* nuclear program
