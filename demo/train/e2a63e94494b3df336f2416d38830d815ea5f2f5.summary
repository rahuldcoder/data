-- still using crutches to walk , @entity1 is the most recent victim of a gulf sturgeon strike while on the @entity3 in @entity4			1
" i have been on the river my whole life , " she says			0
" for some freak accident like this to happen -- it 's just crazy			2
" it was @entity11 weekend when @entity12 and her boyfriend borrowed a friend 's airboat for a joyride on the river			2
@entity12 was seated with one leg bent on her chair and the other leg stretched out straight atop a footrest when a sturgeon jumped in front of the boat			1
" when the fish was coming down i was like , ' oh my gosh , it 's going to hit me ! ' so i went to pull my leg up , and when i pulled my leg up i made it about halfway -- like about my calf muscle , " recalls @entity12			1
" then the fish collided with my leg			2
" jumping fish break boater 's leg the impact broke her tibia and her fibula , sending @entity12 to the hospital for the remainder of the holiday weekend			1
" the report said it [ the sturgeon ] was between 4 and 6 feet and between 60 or 70 pounds , " says @entity12			1
" but i think it was bigger than 60 to 70 pounds			2
" it may have looked huge , but it was a relatively small fish considering that gulf sturgeon can grow up to 8 feet long and weigh up to 200 pounds			1
" they 're really bony , hard fish , " explains @entity47 ( @entity47 ) officer @entity56 " it 's like an alligator on the outside of their skin			1
they 're really almost as hard as a rock			0
" as the @entity60 approaches , public services announcements warn of firework and campfire dangers , but near the @entity3 in northwest @entity4 the message to the public is : beware of flying fish			1
" we do n't want to scare anyone off the river , " says @entity69 , @entity47 spokesperson , " but we do want to make people aware that these fish they do jump and people have gotten injured by them			2
" in 2010 there were no injuries by sturgeon reported			0
" we were hoping for another quiet year like that , " says @entity77 , " but we 've already had nine encounters so far this year			0
" the encounters occur when a sturgeon jumps out of the river as a watercraft is approaching and just as the fish is on its downfall it lands in the vehicle			2
" there 's a bunch of theories out there , but we 're not really sure why they jump out of the water , " says fwc biologist @entity86			2
the largest population of gulf sturgeon can be found in the @entity3 , @entity86 says			1
the sturgeon travel into the river from the @entity97 every summer to spawn			0
" the @entity3 is the last of what they call ' wild rivers ' left in @entity4 , " explains @entity77 , " there 's no dams or man made structures in it			1
so the sturgeons can get on in and up here			0
" @entity77 estimates that between 10,000 and 14,000 of these fish swim into the river every season			1
the spawning season takes place when the weather is warm , schools are on summer break and most companies are closed for the long holiday weekends			1
these factors contribute to the river 's popularity as a place for people to celebrate			2
@entity56 works hard to assure that celebrations do not turn into catastrophes			0
a few years ago , @entity56 witnessed a sturgeon jump out of the water and hit a 9 - year - old girl in the face			0
" i heard the thump , and i saw a young girl fly out of the boat , not just fall out of the boat , she actually went up in the air , " recalls @entity56			0
" probably about 15 feet up and out of the boat and she hit the water			1
" when the little girl was rescued from the water she had two deep lacerations on her jaw and neck , @entity56 remembers			0
he guesses the sturgeon that hit her was 5 feet long and weighed about 70 pounds			1
witnessing that accident has changed the way @entity56 patrols the 30 - mile stretch of river that he is assigned			0
in the past , @entity56 would occasionally warn boaters about the dangers of the jumping fish			0
" now it 's almost every boat i will stop and say , ' watch out for these sturgeons , they are really dangerous , ' " he warns			1
" i would n't sit anybody up front			0
" the front of the boat is where @entity12 was sitting when she was injured			0
since her accident , @entity12 does n't even want to be on the back of a boat on the @entity3			1
she admits it may take some time to get over her fear of the flying fish , but in the meantime she is trying to keep a sense of humor about her accident			0
" i joke with everybody ( who asks what happened ) and tell them i was trying a new type of fishing lure -- i was trying my toes out to see how it worked			0
