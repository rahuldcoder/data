-- @entity1 announced tuesday it will grant amnesty to 6,300 prisoners on wednesday , one in a series of recent moves that could help the isolated nation normalize relations with @entity9 nations including the @entity10			1
but is it really an authentic step toward greater freedoms in one of the world 's most repressive states ? or is it another gesture by the nominally civilian government to appease critics ? @entity21 , a @entity10 assistant secretary of state , called it a " dramatic development " that could prompt @entity24 to consider improving ties			1
the @entity10 imposes an embargo on arms and investment in @entity1 , once known as @entity1 before a military junta took over			1
but if you ask @entity32 , director of the @entity34 - based human rights group @entity32 , the prisoner amnesty is part of the " mood music " created to soothe the world			2
obviously , he said , the amnesty was welcome , but it was hardly signaling the government 's wish for democracy			2
" what 's very clear is that ( president ) @entity46 is willing to make more concessions in order to get sanctions lifted and get more international legitimacy , " @entity44 said			1
the amnesty announcement in state - run media did not make it clear how many political detainees would be included			1
@entity55 has reported that more than 2,200 political prisoners are detained in poor conditions and subjected to torture and cruel treatment			2
their release remains a key demand of @entity63 laureate @entity62 and a priority for lifting of @entity9 sanctions			0
there was cause for optimism after a letter to @entity46 from a new state - appointed human rights panel called for the pardon of " prisoners of conscience who do not pose a threat to the stability of state and public tranquility			0
" @entity1 , ruled by generals since 1962 , denied for decades that political prisoners even existed			1
since @entity1 's elections in november 2010 -- the first in two decades -- its leaders have been gingerly reaching out to critics			1
" now i think it would be fair to say the elections themselves were flawed in many critical ways , and we have continuing concerns about a number of developments inside the country , " @entity21 , the assistant secretary of state for east asian and pacific affairs , said monday in a lecture in @entity89 , @entity90			2
" but it is also undeniably the case that there are dramatic developments under way , " he said			1
" we have stated clearly that we are prepared for a new chapter in our relations , and we are watching carefully developments on the ground			2
and i think it would be fair to say we will match their steps with comparable steps , and we are looking forward over the course of the next several weeks to continuing a dialogue that has really stepped up in recent months			1
" @entity114 , the head of @entity1 's state censorship , called friday for greater press freedoms , saying his own office should be shuttered as part of government reforms , reported @entity122			1
last week , the government suspended the @entity125 dam project on the @entity126 -- annoying the @entity128 but pleasing @entity62 and environmental activists , who had been vocal opponents			0
in september , @entity1 's foreign minister @entity129 held a rare , historic meeting with @entity10 officials in @entity24 following what a @entity133 spokesman characterized as positive developments after years of discord over human rights and other issues			1
a month earlier , @entity62 met with @entity46 at the presidential residence in @entity141 and the two vowed to work together in the nation 's interest , state media reported			2
@entity145 , a spokesman for @entity62 's @entity146 , said then that he thought the meeting " may be the first step towards reconciliation			2
" the @entity146 was banned from the 2010 election , but @entity62 is fighting to restore her party 's legitimacy			0
@entity1 and @entity9 nations have been at odds for years because of @entity1 rulers ' ongoing clampdown on their political foes , most notably @entity62			1
she spent most of the past two decades in some form of detention before being released a week after last year 's elections			2
@entity161 said the government 's talks with @entity62 are also about self - preservation			0
as long as there are popular protests , the government runs the risk of having to crack down on a growing movement as it did in 2007 , when outrage over rising fuel prices escalated to @entity174 monks leading 100,000 people in the largest anti-government demonstrations since 1988			0
" he wants to take politics off the streets of @entity1 and bring it under the parliament 's wing , " @entity44 said about @entity46			1
" he is scared of it being on the streets			0
" @entity185 , fellow for @entity186 at the @entity187 , admitted he was a bit wary about the intentions of a government that in the past has failed implement reforms			0
however , he said he is taken with the scope of the latest developments			2
" given that , this reform has definitely gone beyond what a lot of skeptics expected , including myself , ' @entity185 said			0
a longtime pariah nation , @entity1 , he said , likely wants international recognition			1
" it 's important to them , " @entity185 said			0
" it 's about diversifying their partners , " he said			0
" they do n't want to be totally reliant on @entity128			0
it 's about not being dependent			0
" but a key issue that is not being addressed , said @entity44 , is rights for @entity1 's ethnic minorities , some of whom have waged armed insurgencies against the government			1
until they are included in dialogue , he said , @entity1 can not make progress			1
ultimately , @entity32 has a warning for @entity9 nations : do n't get carried away			0
lift some sanctions if you want to send a message of encouragement , he said			0
" but do n't give away too much , too soon			0
" @entity0 's @entity226 contributed to this report .			0

it is not clear whether political detainees will be among those released
@entity1 has made moves in recent months to reach out to its critics
last month , its foreign minister held a rare , historic meeting with @entity10 officials
