-- a third case of @entity2 in the @entity3 has been reported			1
an unidentified @entity5 man was infected after having " extended face - to - face contact " with an @entity8 man who was diagnosed with the @entity2 virus			1
fortunately , he is no longer ill. the rise in the reported number of @entity2 cases in the @entity3 , @entity13 and @entity14 has fueled concern that this may be the big one : the 21st century equivalent of the 1918 influenza pandemic that killed 3 % to 5 % of the world population			1
concern is appropriate , because the coronavirus responsible for @entity2 can evolve to become more potent public health threats			1
however , i do n't yet see evidence that will happen			0
for one thing , an increase in the number of reported cases is not equivalent to an increase in the number of actual cases			1
as @entity2 testing is expanded from people with severe disease to include those with mild disease or only a history of potential exposure , we will detect more cases of infection			1
the mortality rate associated with infection will decrease from the current estimate of 30 %			0
in short , we do n't yet know the extent to which an increase in the reported number of cases only reflects better case ascertainment			1
@entity2 , like 70 % of all emerging infectious diseases , including influenza , @entity49 , @entity50 and ebola , originates in wildlife			1
with @entity2 , both bats and camels may be implicated			1
studies of camels in @entity57 indicate that the majority have a history of @entity2 coronavirus infection			1
infection appears to occur in early life and then clears			0
up to a third of young camels carry this infectious virus			0
because camels are born in the spring , there may be an increased amount of virus circulating in camels in spring and summer months			0
this may contribute to a seasonal spike in the reported number of @entity2 cases			1
humans may become infected through contact with infected animals , meat or other animal products such as milk			0
however , pandemic spread can not occur without efficient human - to - human transmission			0
the @entity2 coronavirus grows deep in the human respiratory tract , so it is less likely to be transmitted than viruses that grow in teh nose , mouth or upper airways where a sneeze or a cough is sufficient to create an infectious aerosol			2
hospitalized patients with pneumonia - like mers receive vigorous respiratory interventions such as intubation , assisted ventilation , drugs that dilate airways and chest percussion			0
these interventions may bring virus into the environment in aerosols and on the surfaces of medical equipment , resulting in infection of hospital personnel and other patients			0
since the @entity2 coronavirus has been shown to be stable for up to 48 hours , it may be difficult to determine the source of infection as people and equipment circulate in the health care environment			2
to date , cases of human - to - human transmission have only been reported in hospitals and in families where there is intimate contact with an infected person			2
if we notice a change in this pattern such that clusters of infections begin to appear in communities with more casual contact , that would be a strong sign that the virus is evolving to become a pandemic threat			2
the @entity2 cases in new countries are disturbing but not surprising given how globally connected we are			1
international travel and foot traffic make it easier to spread a virus			0
the first two cases reported in the @entity3 , in @entity8 and @entity138 , were health care workers returning from @entity57			1
although a third case has been linked to contact with the @entity8 case , i am cautiously optimistic that a cluster of cases will not be triggered			2
nonetheless , vigilance is essential			0
@entity57 has more than 7 million foreign workers and hosts more than 3 million religious pilgrims annually			0
if new cases arise they will almost certainly be imported			2
the key to an effective pandemic response is to acknowledge that infectious disease challenges are global rather than national			0
information and biological samples must be shared freely to facilitate surveillance and the development of diagnostics , drugs and vaccines			0
in this spirit , the government of @entity57 has recently invited teams of international experts to join forces in addressing the global challenge of @entity2			2
although we are focusing on @entity2 now , the reality is that viruses and antibiotic resistant bacteria with pandemic potential are continuously emerging and re-emerging worldwide			2
the recent @entity2 cases should not trigger an alarm			1
but if a pandemic happens , it is important we are prepared to combat it .			0

a third case of @entity2 in the @entity3 has been reported
@entity179 : the recent rise of @entity2 cases should not cause panic
he says if we see clusters of infections that would be cause for concern
@entity179 : new @entity2 cases are not surprising given how globally connected we are
