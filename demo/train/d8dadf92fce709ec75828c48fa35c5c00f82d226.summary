@entity0 is on pace to have its least productive year in modern history , earning a " do - nothing " label and adding another unwanted statistic to a body already facing chronically low approval ratings			1
" to date , the @entity9 has passed nearly 150 bills this @entity0 that the @entity11 has failed to act on , " @entity8 speaker @entity8 argued wednesday			1
" @entity12 ( and ) the president continue to stand in the way of the people 's priorities			0
" @entity17 are tossing responsibility right back in the @entity20 's lap , arguing that hardline @entity9 conservatives are blocking legislative progress			1
meanwhile , @entity24 's national legislature is growing increasingly dysfunctional			0
no deal , but sides said to be closer on budget deal so far , 56 bills have been signed into law in the first session of the 113th @entity0			1
assuming legislators do n't pick up the pace next year -- and the smart money says they wo n't as the midterms draw near -- this will become the least productive @entity0 in at least the last 40 years , according to a @entity37 analysis of congressional records			1
is the fact that fewer bills have become law necessarily a bad thing ? that depends on your point of view			2
but representatives and senators on both sides of the aisle readily acknowledge that some major issues have not been addressed			0
@entity20 obstruction of @entity52 is closing hospitals @entity0 has n't passed a budget , among other things			1
none of the 12 annual spending bills has made it to the president 's desk			0
we do n't have a new farm bill			0
tax and entitlement reform are dead in the water			0
adding insult to injury , in october the federal government had its first partial shutdown in nearly two decades			0
the most important issue in @entity73 political circles , naturally , is who 's responsible			0
@entity17 point out that roughly one - third of the 148 bills passed by the @entity20 - controlled @entity9 so far this year were attempts to repeal , delay or defund @entity52 that had zero chance of passing the @entity11 or surviving a certain presidential veto			1
@entity73 could still screw up your holidays more than a dozen of those measures were also partisan , piecemeal spending bills passed during the government shutdown that had no chance of being signed into law			1
some of them had nothing to do with major issues at all , such as the bills renaming courthouses in @entity92 , @entity93 , and @entity94 , @entity95			0
senate majority leader @entity96 has called the @entity9 @entity20 a bunch of " modern - day anarchists			1
" but @entity20 argue that @entity17 are standing in the way of priorities such as entitlement reform			2
@entity17 are standing in the way of a major overhaul of the tax code , they insist			2
while both the @entity9 and the @entity11 passed farm bills , @entity17 are blocking much - needed changes to the country 's agriculture laws , @entity20 say			1
as is usually the case in @entity73 , your opinion of which party is to blame is probably determined by which party you belong to			0
meanwhile , @entity17 and @entity20 are growing more ideologically distant by the day			2
and that is a recipe for gridlock			0
opinion : here 's something @entity0 could actually do			2

@entity0 is on track to have its least productive year in recent history
@entity8 blames the @entity17 senate , @entity9 , cites 148 @entity9 - passed bills
many targeted @entity52 , dealt with shutdown with no chance of passage
@entity17 blame @entity9 conservatives for impeding legislative progress
