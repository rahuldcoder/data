-- these days , it 's impossible to overstate the popularity of games for social networks , with @entity6 titles like " @entity7 , " " @entity6 " and " @entity8 " all boasting massive followings			1
to cynics , popular games such as @entity12 's new " @entity11 , " which recently racked up 20 million users in just 36 days , may seem like simple carbon copies of earlier hits -- most obviously " @entity17 , " which once touted four times as many players			1
not so , argue industry insiders , who maintain that imitation is both the sincerest , and most sensible , form of flattery available to today 's game designers			1
" @entity28 certainly uses a formula for its games , " says @entity26 , editor - in - chief of @entity27			1
" ' @entity11 ' takes elements of ' @entity17 , ' including harvesting and helping neighbors , and then adds elements from more traditional strategy games to it			1
since [ the company ] is notoriously metrics - driven , i predict that they will stick to this formula ... it seems to be working well for them			2
" it 's a sentiment clearly echoed by @entity43 , ceo of @entity44 , makers of popular @entity6 , @entity45 and @entity47 outings like " @entity48 " and " @entity49			1
" " certainly there are some play mechanics that reappear in ' @entity11 , ' but i 'd expect that from any game developer , " he says			1
arguing that " @entity17 " was " basically a rip - off " of earlier title " @entity55 " anyway , @entity43 counters that " @entity11 " is " a step in the right direction " for the company because it offers a more original take on an existing formula			1
the idea of recycling core game mechanics is n't really a big deal -- witness the number of military - themed shooters on the market for pcs and consoles , @entity43 said			1
" if something works well , why not keep using it ? " " games in general , including board games , sports , video games and more , tend to use successful mechanics over and over again , just like movies have formulaic plots , " concurs @entity72 , creative director at @entity73			0
" it reduces risk and takes advantage of existing player knowledge			0
" but @entity72 believes the practice of recycling game concepts , while appealing to profit - minded companies , also has the potential to backfire			2
" in casual games , players not only want , but need to have some kind of idea how to play a game when they first [ try ] them , and these common paradigms provide context , " she says			2
" the key , however , is to innovate on them or introduce a completely new mechanic			0
the potential downside is that players can get tired of the same old patterns over and over again			0
" in @entity17 , players manage a virtual farm by planting and harvesting virtual crops and raising livestock			0
@entity11 transplants this concept to the wilderness , where players fell trees , clear brush , find arrowheads and build a @entity112 - themed homestead			1
some outspoken critics say that enough is enough already			0
" there will always be some players who want more of the same , " says @entity114 , founder of casual game reviews site @entity116			2
" i think the majority of game players online , however , have a short attention span and always want to be challenged			2
" " some companies are releasing very innovative games , " he says			0
" examples include ' @entity126 ' ( create and send trains between friends ) , ' @entity124 ' ( create an army of office workers and fight away ) and ' growing diary ' ( a chance to relive your life as a 5 - year - old )			0
" i think the bigger question is whether companies that take such risks are rewarded with success on @entity6			0
' @entity11 ' in one hour is making more money and driving more game traffic than all the innovative games combined			1
" for those seeking the next big thing , experts agree that social games are just scratching the surface when it comes to pushing creative boundaries			0
" @entity153 game makers are just getting warmed up , " says @entity27 's @entity26 , citing @entity148 and its swashbuckling title " @entity151 ! " as a prime example			1
" nobody 's run out of ideas , " agrees @entity72			2
" in fact , i think we 're seeing more diversity of topics in social games than we 're seeing in the traditional game market			0
because of [ social gaming 's ] nature and shorter development cycles , though , we 're also more able to see the ' me too ' clones way faster			0

@entity12 's " @entity11 " recently racked up 20 million users in 36 days
@entity43 : " @entity11 " is " a step in the right direction " for the company
" @entity153 game makers are just getting warmed up , " says @entity27 's @entity26
