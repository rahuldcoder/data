-- bears riding motorcycles , tigers jumping through flaming hoops and pigs leaping off diving boards			0
just some of the " entertainment " that can be seen at circuses , zoos and safari parks in @entity11 , according to a report by @entity13 into animals cruelty			1
the @entity17 - based animal rights campaign group visited 13 safari parks and zoos in @entity11 and according to @entity20 , @entity13 's @entity21 , found that the animal shows " portray the animal to the public in a humiliating way " and have no educational value			1
" there is a misunderstanding really within @entity11 at the moment about what these animals are experiencing , " @entity20 told @entity0			1
the report says that many of the performance animals that include tigers , lions , @entity38 black bears , elephants and monkeys are born and bred in captivity and brutalized throughout their lives			2
" these animals have been suffering from birth , really			0
once they 're born they go into this industry			0
and straight away the trainers are starting to brutalize them to make them to do these tricks ...			0
we saw some of the training of the younger animals ; they were continually hit to make sure they learnt these tricks so that when they 're out in the performance ring they perform them to the best standard			0
" " once the trick is finished they then go to the backstage area where they 're housed in the most shocking conditions			0
all kinds of animals are held in cages full of faeces , with very little access to water , very little access to food			0
" the abuse of performing animals is n't specific to @entity11			2
" animal cruelty is happening in every country across the world , " said @entity20			1
however @entity20 points out that in @entity11 there are currently no animal protection laws , a reason why @entity13 have worked with @entity11 academics to draft legislation not just for animals in captivity , but all animals			1
despite the findings of their investigation , @entity20 is encouraged by a few signs of progress by the @entity11 government to take animal protection seriously			2
according to a government report on july 29 the @entity91 accused companies that have animal performance shows of having excessive focus on profits , leading to the mistreatment and death of the animals			2
" we 're very pleased that the @entity11 government has said that they want the zoos and safari parks to look at the conditions they keep their animals in to rectify these problems , " said @entity20 .			1
