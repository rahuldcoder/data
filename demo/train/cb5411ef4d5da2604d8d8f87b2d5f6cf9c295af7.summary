-- the birthday girl every @entity2 is the @entity3 , the image on party napkins , on parade floats and the backdrop for fireworks displays in @entity9			1
she is the ultimate @entity12 symbol , a gift from @entity14 to the @entity12 , it is said , implying that she was a gift given government to government			2
the truth is , she could more correctly be called a gift from one artist to the world			2
in an era when we have given up the desire to astound each other simply to please or provoke wonder , this an important distinction			2
@entity28 dreamed up this colossus back in the late 1800s			1
a middle - tier statue maker , he took his plan to @entity32 and pitched a colossal robed slave holding up a torch to stand at the mouth of the @entity36			0
when that deal failed , @entity28 brushed off the design and brought it to @entity12 , all on his own dime			1
he went door to door , office to office , presenting the vision and meeting with rejection			0
but with the well wishes of a few staunch supporters , he kept driving onward , winning other commissions to pay the bills and building @entity3 piece by piece in @entity54 , paying for each section as soon as he could drum up donations			1
he sought out all of his engineering collaborators on his own			0
he dreamed up entertainments to raise monies through ticket sales			0
and it was he who yanked the massive @entity14 flag from her face at her unveiling in 1886			0
he threw himself into the arms of a friend and wept			0
you say the name @entity28 , and even savvy @entity69 look blank			1
@entity28 could foresee that future			1
when he visited @entity3 just before leaving @entity12 that year , he acknowledged , " she is going away from me			1
" he had lost the sense that she was his , a feeling he had possessed when climbing over her copper structure in @entity54			1
she would be given to future generations			1
@entity28 created one of the most powerful trademarks in history and is largely unknown			1
i suppose few people know the name @entity85 either , the man who designed @entity88 's @entity87 -- and that was pretty powerful , too			1
but still it seems a bit amazing @entity28 should go largely unrecognized for his work of art. we might not feel constantly awestruck that a work 305 feet tall -- taller than the ancient @entity96 , whose legend lasted millennia -- mingles with us			1
but @entity3 , barring emergency closures for events such as @entity102 , attracts about 3.8 million tourists a year			1
every year , she flutters the hearts of people hiking to her head , as surely as she fluttered the hearts of immigrants arriving in the @entity111			2
she is an echo of an era when people sought to produce wonder and ecstasy in their fellow citizens purely for the sake of creating a fabulous artifact of human possibility , even if their personal fame might vanish before the work did			1
astounding and delighting one another was the vogue			0
@entity125 made his tower , just after he designed the scaffold for @entity3 's interior			1
@entity129 proposed a colossal phonograph inside @entity3 to make her " talk			1
" inventors brought their products of genius to kaleidoscopic @entity136 to enchant viewers as much as serve merchant interests			0
" when i discover a subject grand enough , i will honor that subject by building the tallest statue in the world , " @entity28 said in his 20s , 30 years before he unveiled his statue			1
it is hard to imagine anyone nowadays either demonstrating the patience to wait for an idea to strike or pursuing the goal of honoring a subject ... a concept			2
ideas are now considered important only if they are flypaper for money , not precious , heaven - sent gifts			2
good ones are catchy or addictive			0
few people try to invent something that will make the consumer say , " look what humankind has achieved ! " our popular entertainments titillate or intoxicate			2
i worry we have lost our sense of the importance of sharing our talents for the common good , partly because there is so much economic pressure put on the middle class , with stagnating wages and rising costs for housing , food and more			2
the middle class , in my historical research , seems the group from which big ideas have long sprung			0
and we compound the pressure by stealing the work of our inventors and artists , leaving them no means to actually survive			0
we weigh down our potential visionaries and inventors with college debt			0
when they begin to produce , say , music , we take it from them and pay fractions of pennies to listen to it , even as we pay stockbrokers at the lowest end $ 7 to $ 10 to make a trade			0
we underpay or do n't pay for a journalist 's writing			0
we require so little public art or decorative art that those artists of ours who do n't rise into the filament - thin clique of superstars only survive by working at many other jobs			2
anyone not connected to a company is required to double pay @entity209 taxes as well as burdensome health insurance premiums ( even with @entity211 )			0
so there is no time for tinkering or deep pondering unless you work for @entity217 or @entity218 or @entity219			0
putting our geniuses under the corporate umbrella means we craft amazing inventions , but before we can gloat that mankind has achieved something great for mankind , we monetize the hell out of the invention , putting it out of reach for most or , in the case of , say , medical inventions actually turning those great discoveries into financial burdens now i know that @entity28 created his work for more than altruistic purposes			1
showing his own anxiety , he got the @entity3 copyrighted with the hope that he could earn income from the commercial use he knew was coming ( he was savvy to what he considered the less appealing part of @entity12 )			1
when he could never collect , he groused at his financially tight existence			0
but because he had received cheerleading in his youth from his mother , who encouraged his pursuit of grander visions , he could at least rest easy that he got to see the work complete and knew it would survive him			0
nowadays , if we love our kids , dare we encourage them to create something vast and important that might last centuries ? unless their creation was a money magnet , encouraging such an undertaking would almost be like condemning them to potential extinction			1
in @entity28 's day , you could try something big and if it did n't work out , you would have your disappointment , but you could still pay the doctor in barter			1
you could suffer setbacks and failures and know that you would at least get by			0
it 's interesting to me that in my neighborhood in @entity272 , the artist @entity270 has installed a giant sugar @entity274 in an abandoned sugar factory that is soon to be turned into pricey condominiums			0
i 'm sure the real estate agents love it as a lure for those future condo sales			2
regardless , the lines stretch down the block every day , every hour , for weeks now and visitors speak to reporters who ask about their intense emotional and intellectual reactions to this massive otherworldly sculpture			0
people flock to see this colossal @entity274			2
they come because it 's a happening but they also come , i believe , because they are so starved for the work of a person trying to impress them and to amaze them without a corporate entity intervening to make a bundle on it			1
they wait on noisy @entity298 for a fleeting taste of this rarity , for a sign we might still have space for human invention ... that we can all share in what humanity can achieve .			0
