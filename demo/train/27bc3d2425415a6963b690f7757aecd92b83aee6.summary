-- i lived through 9/11			0
now i live two blocks from ground zero			0
this sunday , i walked over to view two competing rallies - pro and con - over the @entity6 cultural center ( with mosque ) that is to be built on @entity8 , near the site of the former @entity10			1
the rally against the center was predictably more crowded			1
perhaps 2,000 people clustered on @entity14 -- off - duty firefighters , construction workers and family members of the fallen from 9/11 -- all watched over by @entity18 's finest			1
the cranes of ground zero were visible in the background			0
looking at the signs and talking with the people , it soon became clear that the battle over the center has become a proxy war for other issues			1
it is a powerful magnet for passionate feeling in a combustible political environment			2
many signs warned about sharia law , as if the center represents a first step toward the unconstitutional imposition of @entity6 's religious principles on @entity38			1
at the side of the speaker 's stage , two mock missiles had slogans painted on their side referring to @entity46 's pursuit of a nuclear weapon			2
beneath one of the " missiles " was written " @entity50 : with a middle name is @entity52 ( sic )			0
@entity54 : what is your excuse ? " ( mayor @entity58 has strongly supported the building of the @entity6 center			1
) and there were flashes of wing - nuttery			1
a man in a @entity66 flag shirt and a cowboy hat held a sign that read " i 'm afraid the @entity69 has ended			2
" a man in a plastic @entity50 mask with devil 's horns affixed to its side held a sign saying " @entity76			1
" for some folks , the @entity6 center near ground zero has become a metaphor for what they fear @entity50 wants to do to the nation			1
this helps to explain the troubling rise in the number of people who believe fear - mongering emails that claim that the president is @entity90 or not born in the nation			2
but the vast majority of the signs i saw were sobering : " it 's not about @entity95 , its about respect for the ( 3000 ) dead ; " " the mosque is salt in the wound of 9/11 ; " " it 's my first amendment right to protest this travesty ... just because you have the right does n't mean you should			1
" these are not signs of so - called " @entity106 , " let alone hatred of all @entity90 , as the wife of the @entity109 , @entity110 , sweepingly asserted this week			1
they are instead common sense and easily anticipated concerns in a community that lost so many lives to @entity116 ( not @entity6 ) terrorism less than a decade ago			1
if the goal of the center is really to promote healing , the reaction so far is evidence of failure			2
a genuinely inter-faith center on that site would better accomplish those aims			2
the counter protest was pitifully small by comparison ; a few dozen people , no stage set or amplifiers , signs with earnest slogans like " grief is no excuse for bigotry or war " or self - righteous non-sequiturs like " @entity38 , when did it become @entity133 to be a bigot and a racist again			1
" conflict between the two protests was kept to a minimum by the police , but there were angry debates and heated exchanges			2
one man walked by the center protestors and said " die peacefully			2
" he said his name was @entity151			0
i asked @entity151 what he meant by that			0
he backed away and said that he hoped the protestors would find peace before the hereafter			0
" this has nothing to do with the mosque			0
they are just racist haters			0
that 's not the @entity38 we know			2
i 've been living here 40 years			0
" he pointed to a 10 - year old boy in a red baseball cap , who i assumed was his grandson			2
" his father is a @entity170			0
where are we going to go ? this is our country ...			0
they have opinions , that 's fine			2
but do n't hate @entity6			1
those who did wrong , they should be punished			0
but the same thing is true for the group in the @entity179 that killed 1.5 million @entity180			0
" " are you comparing president @entity184 to terrorists ? , " i asked			0
" oh , absolutely , " he said			0
" look at what happened in @entity187			0
you think @entity90 are going to forget that ? " the truth is rarely pure and never simple			0
attempts to paint all opponents of the center 's location as bigots are wrong			1
attacks on the center 's organizers as a fifth column flank for @entity199 are ignorant			1
the majority of people i spoke to seemed clear on the constitutional right to build an @entity6 cultural center / mosque , as president @entity50 asserted			1
the real issue is what the president later called " the wisdom " of the site 's selection			1
the fact of this debate -- however messy -- is evidence of @entity38 's freedom and pluralism			0
we are debating whether or not we should override our own sensitivities in an attempt to teach the world a larger lesson , or whether our openness is being exploited by people who would undo it			0
the stakes are heightened because we are engaged in a non-optional war against @entity116 terrorism			0
but as president @entity184 and president @entity50 have repeatedly emphasized , our enemy is most assuredly not @entity6 as a whole			1
people who are trying to exploit this debate for political gain are playing a dangerous game			1
@entity38 is great because we are good , and the example of our magnificent pluralism is the ultimate repudiation of the intolerance of extremists and fundamentalists			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity242 .			1

@entity242 went to protests over @entity6 center , says it 's become proxy for other issues
protesters held *inflammatory* signs , he says , some from right - wing extreme
but some protesters earnestly opposed , others just conflicted , he says
@entity242 : @entity6 as a whole is not the enemy ; exploiting issue for political gain is dangerous
