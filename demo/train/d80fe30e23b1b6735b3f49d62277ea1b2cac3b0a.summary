@entity0 -- on monday , i signed an online petition standing with president @entity4 , @entity5 and others to urge @entity7 to pass the @entity8			0
it was a small gesture to stand for what is fair			1
the @entity8 , simply stated , requires the wealthiest @entity11 to pay taxes at rates not less than rates paid by middle - income @entity11			1
current loopholes that allow millionaires and billionaires to have unfairly low tax rates would be closed			1
so much has happened this year to focus our attention on what is fair : @entity4 's @entity25 address , the @entity27 case , the rhetoric around the @entity30 's review of the @entity31 and @entity33 's proposed budget , with its cuts to services to middle - and low - income @entity11			1
what has happened to the concept of fairness ? i 'll tell you : it 's been retooled			1
no longer is it defined as my parents taught me			1
i hear their voices saying , " play fair , " " share ( my toys ) and play fair , " " do n't cheat			1
" " you 'll have your turn at bat , play fair			1
" " do n't fight , play fair			2
" even in the midst of segregation , with its pervasive lack of fairness on every front , they never wavered in their lessons about fairness			2
more important , there was clarity of meaning			0
@entity61 was at the heart of being a good person			0
@entity61 was about how i related to others , combined with how others related to me			0
fairness was not one - sided			1
in my early 30s , i worked for someone who said , " fair is when i win			1
" it was his attempt to clarify inherent complexities in the term " fair			2
" it was then i awakened to a definition of " fair " i had not known , definition in which the individual determined fairness by how the situation affected him and him alone			1
in this year 's @entity25 message , @entity4 said , " we can restore an economy where everyone gets a fair shot and everyone does their fair share and everyone plays by the same set of rules			1
" i know what those words mean to me			0
i now know they may mean something very different to others			0
some heard the same words and thought , " fair is when i win			1
" how else can we explain the person who got his job because of personal or family connections , now protesting another person getting a job because of government or corporate initiatives ? how else can we explain cuts or freezes in salaries for workers and huge pay raises and bonuses for top executives ? how else can we explain board members approving such bonuses , saying " it 's only fair " ? how else can we explain how those with the most financial resources pay the lowest tax rates ? fair ? over my 60 - plus years of living , i have been close to people of varied socioeconomic levels and life experiences			1
the differences are often striking			0
i was working as a corporate executive during the developmental stages of @entity131 , the @entity31 , currently under review by the @entity30			0
there , i was with my peers in our good jobs with comprehensive health insurance			0
some were indifferent to health care reform , while others were vehemently against it			0
for me , it was personal			0
affordable , accessible , quality health care for every person was only fair			2
was it " only fair " because i had more personal contact with poor people or sick people or people without health insurance ? was it " only fair " because i knew the challenges and outrageous costs faced by my mother , who struggled with multiple sclerosis , or my sister , who has sarcoidosis ? perhaps			2
but still today , as a retiree , i think it only fair			2
my peers , for the most part , were good people			0
yet there were times i thought their attitudes and actions most unfair			0
it really scares me that " fair , " as i know it , may have gone for good			2
the bright flames of innovation , hard work , and individual and collective achievement are snuffed out when people feel that they do not have a fair shot			1
snuffed out when rules change to fit the whims of those in power			2
snuffed out because people stop trying and give up on their dreams			0
as a teenager , i fell in love with the writings of the brilliant poet @entity183 ( 1902 - 67 )			0
in his " @entity185 , " he asked : " what happens to a dream deferred ? does it dry up like a raisin in the sun ? or fester like a sore -- and then run ? does it stink like rotten meat ? or crust and sugar over -- like a syrupy sweet ? maybe it just sags like a heavy load			0
or does it explode ? " @entity198 grant me strength to fight for what is fair			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity204 .			1

@entity206 : it 's only fair that the wealthiest pay *higher* tax rates
she says some have *redefined* " fairness " as " when i win "
@entity204 : we have been taught that fairness is not one - sided ; it 's about others , as well
she says the spirit of innovation and achievement is snuffed out when things are not fair
