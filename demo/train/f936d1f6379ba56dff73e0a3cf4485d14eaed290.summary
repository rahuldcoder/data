@entity0 -- @entity3 's north @entity0 office is nestled between a giant prison and a handful of industrial units			1
it 's an unassuming hq for woman responsible for such ground - breaking buildings as the @entity10 and the upcoming 140,000 square - meter @entity11			1
" i like the fact that it does n't look like an architect 's office from the outside , " said @entity3			1
" i choose to be in an edgy area where there are no other architects			2
" however , once inside the warehouse - like building , there 's no doubt you 've come to the right place			1
the vast open plan interior is dotted with cardboard architects ' models in glass cabinets			0
there 's a thick red carpet and the 50 - odd staff and visitors leave shoes at the door to pad around in socks or bare feet			1
the wisdom of women : whose words inspire you ? @entity3 , 57 , has had offices here for a year			1
four years ago , she set up her own practice after the death of her former husband , with whom she had worked for 20 years			1
on the day we meet , @entity3 has just flown back from @entity46 where she was talking about one of her latest projects , a new cultural center in a former industrial area on the banks of the river in @entity53			1
" it 's about regenerating the riverfront , but we need to connect it back to the city , both literally , conceptually and socially , " she said			2
" we have created public spaces on the roof and in front of the building , so the roof will be a destination itself			0
" public spaces for me are a very important aspect of architecture , where people meet and ideas are exchanged that drive society forward			0
" @entity3 went to a top independent school in @entity0 , but left at the age of 16 , planning to go to art college			1
" i was quite independent at 16 , " she said			0
" i was quite impetuous , i never felt daunted			0
" if my children decided to leave school at 16 , i would find that difficult as a parent , but i did n't ask my parents ' opinion			0
it was n't up for debate			0
" while doing a foundation art course , @entity3 became interested in architecture and acquired the a-level qualifications she needed			1
" i started reading about art history and discovered architecture , " she said			0
" it had n't crossed my radar before			0
" also on leading women : @entity89 tells women ' less stress , more living ' early in her career , @entity3 worked for high profile @entity95 " starchitects " @entity96 and @entity97			2
in 1989 , @entity3 joined the @entity99 architect @entity98 as a partner in his practice @entity102 , and shortly afterward they were married			1
during their 20 - year partnership , @entity3 and @entity98 worked on the unusual @entity10 at @entity106 , a spaceship - like structure that appears to hover above the ground , and a new @entity110 department store in @entity111			1
@entity112 , the first all - aluminum building in the world , won a host of awards , including the @entity117 , @entity95 's most prestigious architectural prize , in 1999			1
" it was probably the most complex and ground breaking project we will ever do , " said @entity3			2
" it was built by a boat builder , but 12 meters in the air , rather than upside down in a boat yard			0
" the @entity125 ( @entity125 ) , who were our clients , were one of the great bastions of the @entity95 establishment , taking on a very radical building , so there were tensions			0
" while working on @entity133 , @entity3 had her son @entity134 , taking no time off for maternity leave			1
" i was doing the competition report in hospital , " she said			0
" it was ridiculous , but it was worth it			0
it was tough , but i was so high from having a baby and doing the competition , that i just got on with it			0
i was extremely tired for many years			2
" their next big project was a new @entity110 store in @entity111 , @entity148 , in 2003 , winning multiple awards for its @entity150 of aluminum discs and becoming a landmark of the city			0
" the building has become completely synonymous with @entity111			0
it 's a powerful piece of iconography and people go just to ride on the escalators as well as to shop , " said @entity3			1
read more : the woman using social media to predict the future @entity3 and @entity98 eventually divorced , but continued to work together until his sudden death in @entity163 in 2009 , albeit with a strained relationship towards the end			1
" @entity166 almost had two offices for some time , " said @entity3			2
" the people working with me stayed with me , and the people working with him would have gone with him if he had not died			2
" after @entity98 's death , @entity3 set up her own practice , @entity174 with four other directors			1
" the change happened under traumatic circumstances , " she said			0
" it was a very difficult time and i underestimated how difficult the transition would be			0
" we had a significant reputation as @entity102 , and starting @entity174 , we had that as our heritage but not our future			0
" it took a good two or three years for the office to bed down and establish its own identify			2
" @entity174 is now thriving			0
in addition to the @entity53 cultural center , and a 140,000 square - meter hotel and shopping center in @entity190 , @entity3 was chosen in 2012 as the winning design for a new underground extension to the @entity193 in @entity0			1
" we are creating a vast courtyard in front of the building , it 's going to be the first porcelain courtyard , " said @entity3			1
" it will be like an outdoor room where people can meet and hang out , so they can delay the decision to enter the museum			0
" on several occasions , @entity3 has collaborated with the @entity207 - born @entity95 sculptor @entity206 , including on a design for a new subway station in @entity210			1
