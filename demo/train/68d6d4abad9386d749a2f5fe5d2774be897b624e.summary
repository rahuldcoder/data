@entity0 -- a murky @entity3 militant group has described a deadly attack in @entity6 's @entity5 last month as a " jihadi operation " and warned of more violence to come , according to an organization that monitors extremist websites			1
in a speech posted online , @entity12 , the leader of the @entity13 ( @entity13 ) , said those who carried out the attack in the heavily policed center of @entity18 were " mujahideen , " the @entity11 said in a report late last week			1
on october 28 , a vehicle drove through security barriers into a crowd in @entity5 , crashed into a pedestrian bridge in front of the @entity25 and burst into flames			2
the attack killed five people -- including the three in the vehicle -- and wounded 40 others			1
@entity6 authorities have accused @entity32 -- a @entity35 - speaking , predominantly @entity34 ethnic group from the western region of @entity37 -- of carrying out the vehicle attack			1
@entity39 is the name used by many @entity32 groups to refer to @entity37			0
frequent outbreaks of unrest have hit the resource - rich region , where the arrival of waves of @entity49 people over the decades has fueled tensions with the @entity32			0
@entity6 authorities have cracked down heavily on violence involving @entity32 , deepening resentment			2
@entity6 links @entity3 terrorist group to @entity5 crash ' only the beginning ' it was unclear from the site report if @entity12 was claiming responsibility for the @entity5 attack or just commenting on it			1
but he warned that " such operations are only the beginning , " according to site , and that @entity32 fighters will target the @entity64 , a grand building next to @entity5 where the @entity6 parliament meets and ceremonial events are held			1
" o @entity6 unbelievers , know that you have been fooling @entity39 for the last 60 years , but now they have awakened , " @entity12 was quoted as saying by @entity62			2
" the people have learned who is the real enemy and they returned to their own religion			0
" the audio recording of his speech was part of a roughly 8 - minute video posted on the @entity13 's website on november 12 , site said			1
his comments were referenced in a number of @entity6 state - media outlets , including @entity84 , the official news agency			2
@entity6 authorities have said they believe the @entity5 attack was instigated by a separatist group , the @entity13 ( @entity13 ) , which @entity18 has linked to outbreaks of violence in @entity37 in the past			1
@entity5 crash : terrorism or cry of desperation ? ' information vacuum ' the relationship between the @entity13 and the @entity13 is unclear			2
some analysts suggest that the two may be part of the same organization			0
the @entity13 has been cited in previous years as threatening revenge over @entity6 treatment of @entity32 , but little is known about the group			1
" as far as anyone knows , the @entity13 may only exist in name alone , " said @entity103 , a researcher at @entity104 in @entity105			0
" it has been referred to as one of the many jiangdu ( or , @entity37 independence ) groups for many years , yet no one is quite sure whether or not they exist - at least in their own right			0
" the available evidence on separatist organizations in @entity37 points to " several disparate groups that neither have a history of coordination nor -- it would appear -- the means or will to coordinate , " he said			0
" what we know of them is largely through two diametrically opposed parties : the @entity6 government and @entity32 diaspora groups , " @entity103 said			0
" and the truth about @entity128 and its counterparts lies somewhere in the information vacuum between the two			0
" he said he was skeptical that the @entity13 had carried out the @entity5 attack			1
" @entity134 groups have supposedly claimed responsibility for attacks outside of @entity37 in the past , but such claims have never been verified , " he said			0
@entity1 's @entity138 contributed to this report .			0
