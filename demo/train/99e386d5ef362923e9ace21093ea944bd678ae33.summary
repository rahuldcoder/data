-- more than two million people are dying every year from the effects of outdoor air pollution , according to a new study			1
an estimated 2.1 million deaths are caused by anthropogenic increases of fine particulate matter ( @entity8 ) while a further 470,000 are killed annually as a result of human - caused increases in ozone pollution			1
@entity12 , co-author of the study published in the journal of @entity15 said : " outdoor air pollution is an important problem and among the most important environmental risk factors for health			1
" @entity20 is the worst affected area with researchers estimating more than a million people dying prematurely every year from @entity8 pollution and 203,000 from ozone pollution			1
@entity25 has the second highest air pollution mortality rates with an estimated 397,000 deaths from fine particulates and ozone accounting for , on average , 118,000			1
next comes @entity30 which has estimated average of 158,000 deaths from @entity8 and 33,300 attributed to ozone			0
@entity34 has fractionally less pm2.5 deaths ( 154,000 , on average ) and 32,800 premature deaths related to ozone while in @entity40 there were an average of 43,000 deaths from fine particulates and 34,400 related to ozone			1
@entity45 used an ensemble of global atmospheric chemistry climate models to estimate concentrations of @entity8 and ozone pollutants			1
fine particulate matter ( dust , soot , smoke and liquid droplets ) is classified as less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter			0
it is particularly dangerous to human health because it can lodge deep in the lungs causing cancer and other respiratory disease , according to the @entity62 @entity61			0
ground level ozone is created by chemical reactions between oxides of nitrogen and volatile organic compounds ( @entity68 ) in the presence of sunlight , say the @entity61			0
the study also investigated the effects of climate change on worsening air pollution , comparing climate models from the year 2000 with pre-industrial times ( 1850 )			1
" very few studies have attempted to estimate the effects of past climate change on air quality and health			1
we found that the effects of past climate change are likely to be a very small component of the overall effect of air pollution , " said @entity12 , assistant professor in the @entity81 at the @entity82 at @entity83			1
" going forward into the future , climate change will get more severe and that could have greater effects on air pollution			1
" the research adds to a growing body of evidence revealing both the human and economic impacts of air pollution around the world			2
a recent report published in the @entity103 medical journal , @entity100 found that the incidence of heart failure rises when air pollution is higher			2
the research , funded by the @entity108 , concluded that a reduction of @entity8 could reduce hospitalizations due to heart failure in the @entity62 saving a third of a billion dollars per year			0
another recent study published in the @entity113 highlighted air pollution problems in @entity115 , suggesting life expectancy could have been lowered by five - and - a - half years			2
even in the @entity118 , air pollution takes a sizable 8.6 - month chunk off life expectancy according to the @entity121			2
but technology to monitor air pollution is improving all the time , says @entity124 , an air quality scientist from the @entity103 's @entity125			2
" historically , air quality is something very much we 've tried to measure and manage spatially -- considering over a total city what the average air quality is			0
what we are getting to now is systems that let us manage the distribution of air quality with knowledge of where people are and what people are doing , " @entity124 told @entity0			0
improved data can help manage the exposure of sensitized individuals ( the young , asthma sufferers , the elderly ) , he says			0
but he concedes that the road to improved air quality might be a long one			0
" we have come to terms with the fact that in the urban environment we get exposed to emissions by our transport systems			0
that transport system is essential and at the moment there is no economically viable way of not emitting pollution at the point of use			0
" either we have to manage those emissions and exposure more intelligently or technologies need to change in our cars			0

air pollution *responsible* for more than two million premature deaths worldwide annually
study assesses impact of fine particulates and ozone using atmospheric climate models
@entity20 worst affected region with over a million deaths per year
study also found that climate change has *n't* had huge impact on effects of air pollution
