it 's an unimaginable horror			2
a 14 - year - old girl with special needs allegedly was raped at school after a teacher 's aide persuaded her to act as bait to catch an accused sexual predator , a fellow student			1
" it has essentially devastated her life , " attorney @entity9 -- who represents the girl and her father -- said of the alleged january 2010 incident			1
the @entity15 and @entity17 @entity16 filed an amicus brief wednesday supporting her family 's federal lawsuit against the @entity22 in @entity23			1
an amicus brief is a legal argument offered to the court by someone who is not a party to the case			1
the @entity30 in @entity31 will decide whether to accept the argument			2
" school administrators knew the student 's extensive history of sexual and violent misconduct and were alerted to the substantial risk he posed " to other students , according to the brief			1
about a week before the alleged rape , @entity43 vice principals @entity41 and @entity44 received a complaint that the boy had touched a female student inappropriately and was assigned in - school suspension , according to federal attorneys			1
a few days later , june @entity51 , a teacher 's aide at the @entity54 - area school , told the principal , @entity55 , that the boy had " repeatedly tried to convince girls to have sex with him in the boys ' bathroom on the special needs students ' corridor " and had actually had sex with one student , according to the brief			1
the boy and his alleged sexual partner denied having sex in the bathroom , but @entity51 recommended the boy be " constantly monitored , " according to the brief			2
@entity55 said the boy could not be punished because he had not been " caught in the act , " the brief reads			2
school policy requires allegations of student - on - student misconduct be substantiated			1
trying to " catch him in the act " on january 22 , 2010 , the boy approached a 14 - year - old girl with special needs who had already declined his " recent , repeated propositions " for sex , according to the brief			1
" she was not physically or mentally handicapped , although she does qualify for special education classes , " @entity9 told @entity85			2
when the girl told @entity51 , she encouraged the girl to " meet ( the boy ) in the bathroom where teachers could be positioned to ' catch him in the act ' before anything happened , " according to the brief			1
the girl initially refused , but then agreed , according to @entity9			2
@entity51 and the girl went to @entity41 's office to explain the plan			1
@entity41 " did not respond with any advice or directive , " according to the brief			0
" if this was problematic for the administration it would have been better to express that on the front end instead of the back end , " said attorney @entity101 , who represents @entity51			0
the girl left @entity41 's office , found the boy in the hallway , and " agreed to meet for sex , " according to the brief			1
" something went wrong , " said @entity9			0
instead of meeting in the boys ' bathroom on the special needs students ' corridor , the boy told the girl to meet him in the sixth - grade boys ' bathroom , in another part of the school , according to the brief			1
" no teachers were in the bathroom to intervene , " the brief reads			0
" she stalled for time			0
she continually tried to fight him off but ultimately was anally raped by this young man , " @entity9 told @entity85			2
" it was evident that this had been a severe trauma for her , " said @entity9			0
police were called and the girl was taken to the @entity133 in @entity54 , where a rape kit was taken , @entity9 told @entity85			2
medical personnel found evidence of trauma " consistent with ( the girl ) being sodomized			2
" the boy claimed he had only kissed her , according to the brief			0
@entity142 investigated over ' date rape ' drug allegations attorneys : boy had a long history of serious misconduct the girl was uncommunicative after the incident , @entity9 said			0
the district attorney in @entity152 investigated the incident , but with a victim who was unable or unwilling to talk about the incident , the office did n't think they had a good case , and did not pursue it			0
even after viewing photographs of the girl 's injuries , vice principal @entity161 " testified that she did n't know whether ( the girl ) had consented to the assault , " according to the brief			1
the school listed the alleged rape as " inappropriate touching a female in boys ' bathroom , " on the student 's computerized disciplinary report			1
he was suspended for five days and sent to an alternative school , but later returned to @entity172 after about 20 days , according to the brief			0
vice principal @entity41 testified that the girl was responsible for herself once she entered the bathroom , according the brief			0
@entity15 and @entity176 attorneys claim the boy had a long history of sexual and other misconduct in school and @entity43 administrators knew it			1
several pages of the 126 - page brief detail years of disciplinary problems			0
the boy had been involved in 15 violent or sex - related proven incidents of misconduct before the alleged rape , according to the brief			0
federal attorneys say details about the severity of the incidents are unavailable because school administrators shredded the boy 's disciplinary files			1
the girl 's father filed the federal lawsuit in october 2010 against the boy , the three administrators , the teacher 's aide and the @entity22			1
" we felt , ( that ) the teacher putting her into this position , because of the policy as interpreted by the school board and the principal , violated @entity209 , " @entity9 told @entity85			1
@entity209 is a federal law aimed at ending sexual discrimination in education			0
in part , it dictates how schools that receive federal funds must respond to claims of sexual harassment			2
in 2010 , a district court judge allowed the father 's claims of state violations , including negligence , against @entity51 and @entity41 , while dropping the boy from the lawsuit because he was a minor			1
the judge tossed out the federal claims -- that the school district violated @entity209 and that @entity51 and school administrators deprived the girl of her civil rights			1
schools preach ' enthusiastic ' yes in sex consent education fighting for a jury trial according to the rare amicus brief , written in part by an attorney with the @entity15 's @entity240 , the school , in its capacity as a recipient of federal funds is " liable for [ its ] deliberate indifference to known acts of peer sexual harassment			1
" on the same day the federal brief was submitted , the @entity248 , joined by 32 national and local organizations , submitted a joint brief supporting the family 's lawsuit			0
earlier this month , the @entity254 and @entity9 submitted a joint brief to the @entity30			0
@entity9 told @entity85 his client deserves her day in court and a jury should weigh in on the @entity260 's requirement of substantiation of allegations of student - on - student misconduct			1
" we hope that the attention that this case is getting will spur a movement on these kinds of policies so that a girl can simply report sexual harassment without having a need to bring a witness with her or roll up her shirt and show bruises , " @entity9 told @entity85			2
the girl was withdrawn from @entity43 and underwent extensive counseling			0
she went to live with her mother in @entity280 , but her mother died soon after			0
instead of moving back to @entity54 , she and her brother were placed with @entity284 in @entity280 , the attorney said			0
@entity285 , the head of public relations for the @entity288 , said the board and school officials " are confident that the 11th @entity289 will rule in favor of the @entity22 and the administrators			2
" " our attorneys recommend that we not discuss ongoing litigation , " she said			0
@entity55 and @entity44 are still principal and vice principal at @entity43			0
@entity41 is now principal at @entity298			0
june @entity51 resigned shortly after the incident			0
" my client has gone from being a teacher 's aide to being a scapegoat , " said @entity51 's attorney			1
when asked why his client thought it was a good idea to use a special needs teen as bait to catch a suspected attacker , @entity308 told @entity85 , " i do n't personally think it is a good idea			2
the events of this case have shown us that it was not			0
