-- footballers can often crumble under the weight of a hefty price tag			1
just ask @entity4 , the once - prolific @entity5 striker who has scored a miserly five goals since joining @entity7 from @entity8 for a @entity10 record $ 80 million in january 2011			2
but not all of soccer 's high - priced stars struggle with their lofty valuations			0
@entity15 has adapted quickly to life as the poster boy of @entity19 's spending spree at @entity21 club @entity20			1
the @entity23 playmaker has found the net 10 times in 25 games since moving to the @entity21 capital from @entity28 club @entity27 for a @entity21 record transfer fee of â ‚ ¬ 42 million ( $ 56 million ) in august 2011			1
@entity15 's form has been a key factor in @entity20 's rise to second in the @entity21 @entity34 , with the team currently sat in the final qualifying spot for the @entity37 and on track to return to the competition for the first time since 2004			1
" there was only pressure at the beginning , " the 22 - year - old told @entity0 when asked about the pressure of his transfer fee			1
" then the pressure goes away and i did n't feel it anymore			0
@entity50 : @entity20 can rival @entity51 's best " the first few games , yeah , because people talked about it a lot			2
and if you do n't score a goal , you think , ' oh , they made the wrong decision and should have bought another player , ' but it happens			0
" @entity15 is one part of a trio with @entity28 connections who have become the face of @entity20 under new @entity68 chairman @entity67 @entity50 , who won the @entity37 as a player and a coach with @entity71 , replaced sacked manager @entity72 in december			1
@entity20 's director of football @entity73 also has ties to the @entity76			1
like former @entity28 international @entity50 , the @entity79 @entity78 winner has been a player and coach at @entity71			1
cash for cups ? @entity68 's influence spreads @entity15 said the influence of @entity73 , also a midfielder in his playing days , was key to his decision to head to the @entity85 , despite reported interest from more prestigious clubs			1
" the person who convinced me the most was @entity73 , " he said			0
" he always showed interest in me and was always in touch			0
" when the club 's project emerged , he was the one who told me about it and encouraged me to come over			0
" there were a lot of good reasons to come in @entity20 's project and i was a part of them			1
luckily , i can tell you that i made the right choice			0
" can @entity68 cash make @entity20 a football force ? @entity15 has been impressed with the impact former @entity7 manager @entity50 has had during his first few months with the club			2
" @entity50 is a big - name manager with lots of experience and was a big change from the previous manager			0
tactically , he does things differently since he has been in other countries , " said @entity15 , who played for @entity113 in his homeland			0
" he knows a lot about how they play in each league and that definitely gives us something we did n't have before			0
" @entity20 have made no secret of their attempts to attract football 's biggest stars , with ambitious bids for @entity128 's @entity127 and @entity130 's @entity129 falling through in january			2
@entity71 's @entity131 and @entity133 's @entity132 have also been linked with @entity20 , and @entity15 admitted he would love his fellow @entity23 international @entity134 to join him too			1
" i 'd like to bring over a player like @entity134 , " he said of the @entity133 striker			1
" he would be a very important part of our team and could make a big difference in @entity21			0
" i have a good relationship with him , but we have n't talked			0
he 's on @entity133 ... it 's not like he 's on a club that 's smaller than @entity20			1
" the two - time @entity21 champions are six points ahead ahead of third - placed @entity148 and one point behind surprise leaders @entity151 following last weekend 's dramatic 4 - 4 draw with @entity153			2
like everyone else involved with the 1996 @entity156 holders , @entity15 knows that the ultimate aim is for @entity20 to compete at the top of @entity51 football			2
" we wanted to be in the qualifying spots and go to the @entity37 , so the team could grow and play another competition			0
" we obviously want to be @entity21 champions because it 's within our grasp			2
but our main goal was always to get to the @entity37			0

@entity20 's @entity15 says he no *longer* feels the pressure of his record price tag
the @entity23 international is the most *expensive* player in @entity21 *history*
