@entity0 , the brutal insurgent / terrorist group formerly known as @entity2 in @entity3 , has seized much of western and northern @entity3 and even threatens towns not far from @entity5			1
from where did @entity0 spring ? one of @entity8 's most toxic legacies is the introduction of @entity2 into @entity3 , which is the @entity0 mother ship			1
if this was n't so tragic it would be supremely ironic , because before the @entity15 invasion of @entity3 in 2003 , top @entity8 officials were insisting that there was an @entity2 - @entity3 axis of evil			1
their claims that @entity20 's men were training members of @entity2 how to make weapons of mass destruction seemed to be one of the most compelling rationales for the impending war			2
after the fall of @entity20 's regime , no documents were unearthed in @entity3 proving the @entity31 axis despite the fact that , like other totalitarian regimes , @entity20 's government kept massive and meticulous records			1
the @entity15 @entity36 had by 2006 translated 34 million pages of documents from @entity20 's @entity3 and found there was nothing to substantiate a " partnership " between @entity20 and @entity2			1
two years later the @entity44 's own internal think tank , the @entity42 , concluded after examining 600,000 hussein - era documents and several thousand hours of his regime 's audio - and videotapes that there was no " smoking gun ( i.e. direct connection between @entity20 's @entity52			0
) " the @entity53 concluded in 2008 , as every other investigation had before , that there was no " cooperative relationship " between @entity20 and @entity2			2
the committee also found that " most of the contacts cited between @entity3 and @entity2 before the war by the intelligence community and policy makers have been determined not to have occurred			1
" instead of interrupting a budding relationship between @entity20 and @entity2 , the @entity62 precipitated the arrival of @entity2 into @entity3			1
although the @entity8 administration tended to gloss over the fact , @entity2 only formally established itself in @entity3 a year and a half after the @entity15 invasion			1
on october 17 , 2004 , its brutal leader @entity69 issued an online statement pledging allegiance to @entity72			0
@entity69 's pledge was fulsome : " by @entity79 , @entity77 sheikh of the @entity78 , if you bid us plunge into the ocean , we would follow you			0
if you ordered it so , we would obey			0
" @entity69 's special demonic genius was to launch @entity3 down the road to civil war			2
in early 2004 , the @entity15 military intercepted a letter from @entity69 to @entity72 in which he proposed provoking a civil war between @entity88 and @entity89			1
@entity69 's strategy was to hit the @entity89 so they would in turn strike the @entity88 , so precipitating a vicious circle of violence in which @entity2 would be cast as the protector of the @entity88 against the wrath of the @entity89			2
it was a strategy that worked all too well , provoking first sectarian conflict in @entity3 and later civil war			0
@entity2 in @entity3 , or @entity0 , regularly attacked @entity89 religious processions , shrines and clerics			1
the tipping point in the slide toward full - blown civil war was @entity2 's february 2006 attack on the @entity106 in @entity107 , which is arguably the most important @entity89 shrine in the world			0
three years into the @entity62 , @entity0 seemed all but unstoppable			0
a classified @entity111 intelligence assessment dated august 17 , 2006 , found that @entity0 had become the de facto government of the western @entity3 province of @entity114 , which is strategically important because it borders @entity115 , @entity116 and @entity117 and makes up about a third of the landmass of @entity3			2
in addition , @entity0 controlled a good chunk of the exurban belts around @entity5 , the " @entity123 " to the south of the capital and many of the towns north of it , up the @entity128 to the @entity116 border			0
thus @entity0 controlled territory larger than @entity131 and maintained an iron grip on much of the @entity88 population			0
in other words , the @entity8 administration had presided over the rise of precisely what it had said was one of the key goals of the @entity62 to destroy : a safe haven for @entity2 in the heart of the @entity144 world			1
by 2007 , @entity2 's untrammeled violence and imposition of @entity148 ideology on the @entity88 population provoked a countrywide @entity88 backlash against @entity0 that took the form of @entity88 " awakening " militias			2
many of those militias were put on @entity157 's payroll in a program known as the " @entity159 "			0
the combination of the @entity88 militias ' on - the - ground intelligence about their onetime @entity0 allies and @entity15 firepower proved devastating to @entity2 's @entity3 franchise			1
and so , between 2006 and 2008 , @entity0 shrank from an insurgent organization that controlled territory larger than the size of @entity131 to a rump terrorist group			0
but @entity0 did not disappear			0
it simply bided its time			0
the @entity116 civil war provided a staging point over the past three years for its resurrection and transformation into the " @entity0 , " or @entity0			0
and now @entity0 has marched back into western and northern @entity3			2
only this time there is no @entity15 military to stop it .			1

when @entity8 administration attacked @entity3 , it argued there was a @entity31 connection
@entity183 : *exhaustive* *research* found *absolutely* no evidence of a connection
ironically , the @entity15 invasion provoked the creation of an @entity2 arm in @entity3 , @entity183 says
@entity192 : @entity15 military fought back against @entity2 in @entity3 , but now @entity15 has departed
