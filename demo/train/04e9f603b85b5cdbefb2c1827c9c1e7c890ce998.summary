-- ahead of upcoming nuclear talks , @entity2 president @entity1 downplayed the threat @entity5 poses to @entity2 , comparing it to an annoying bug			1
" @entity5 is nothing more than a mosquito which can not see the broad horizon of the @entity2 nation , " he said saturday in northeastern @entity2 's @entity8 province , according to the semi-official @entity10 news agency			1
@entity1 said " regional states " were being duped into buying billions in arms from " arrogant and imperial powers , " driven in part by all the talk surrounding a potential war involving @entity2 and @entity5 , the state - run @entity15 reported			1
such military purchases , he said , are unnecessary because there is no war on the horizon between those two nations			0
the @entity2 president alluded to " rulers " who sold " their petrol " for $ 60 billion worth in arms , though he did not mention by name either the purchasing or selling country			2
@entity38 is in the midst of a 20 - year , $ 60 billion arms deal with the @entity40 , including nearly $ 30 billion for @entity42 fighter jets announced late last year			0
@entity1 has long questioned the existence of the @entity44 and , months after taking office in october 2005 , he participated in a lengthy protest called " @entity47 " and has repeatedly derided @entity5			0
" with the force of @entity51 behind it , we shall soon experience a world without the @entity40 and @entity54 , " he said then , according to another @entity15 report			0
on saturday , while seemingly backing away from the potential for an armed conflict , @entity1 hardly signaled that @entity2 should or will embrace @entity5			2
he predicted @entity5 could fall if regional powers cut ties -- particularly by refusing to sell oil to @entity5			0
tensions have ramped up in recent years over @entity2 's controversial nuclear program			1
@entity2 claims it is being developed for peaceful means , while @entity64 powers and @entity5 say they think @entity2 is evading international inspections and intent on developing nuclear weapons			2
this sentiment has led to sweeping sanctions targeting @entity2 's economy , government and its leaders			2
@entity5 prime minister @entity73 has been a particularly harsh , persistent critic of @entity2 's leadership and nuclear program , with rumors circulating for months that @entity5 may pre-emptively strike nuclear sites in @entity2 and possibly set off a regional war			1
and @entity2 's supreme leader , ayatollah @entity81 , last friday " blasted the @entity40 war - mongering rhetoric against @entity2 , " including president @entity83 's assertion that " all options are on the table			1
" he added war " can be 10 times more harmful to " the @entity40 than @entity2 , according to a @entity10 report			0
even with all the back - and - forth , there has been an apparent shift recently in the tone , and manner , of dialogue between the two sides			0
@entity95 foreign policy chief @entity94 described nuclear talks last month in @entity97 , @entity98 , between international and @entity2 diplomats on nuclear matters as " constructive and useful			2
" and @entity2 foreign minister @entity101 said last week that he was optimistic that there would be progress in continued talks with the @entity40 , @entity105 , @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity108 and @entity109 -- the so - called @entity110 , @entity10 reported			1
those parties are set to meet again may 23 in @entity112			0
before then , discussions in @entity116 , @entity117 , will be held on monday and tuesday to address " outstanding issues and remove ambiguities , " @entity2 's envoy to the @entity114 said , according to @entity10			1
@entity0 's @entity120 contributed to this report .			0
