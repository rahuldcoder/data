he then banged on the lavatory door and told the female passenger inside that he needed to go to the bathroom			0
by that time , the first officer had summoned another @entity4 pilot who had been traveling as a passenger to enter the cockpit and the two locked themselves inside , the affidavit states			0
from the cabin , @entity15 tried to enter his security code to gain access to the cockpit " and he banged on the door hard enough that the @entity40 thought he was coming through the door , " according to the affidavit			0

@entity4 has repeatedly praised the first officer , along with an off - duty captain who stepped in to assist and other crew members			1
some passengers have referred to the first officer as a hero			1
but his mother said on thursday that he would reject the label			1
" knowing my son , he would think that he 's not a hero			1
he just did what he was paid to do , " @entity109 said of @entity110			0
" that 's just his job , and he loves his job			1
he 's just a quiet man			1
