" i can ensure that she had indeed suffered no harm , " @entity54 said			0
when reports emerged last week that she died a few days after being married off to a 40 - year - old man , @entity9 were horrified			1
international outrage quickly grew as the alleged incident highlighted once again the controversial issue of child marriage in the nation , where the practice is still legal			2
residents told local media that @entity70 died of internal bleeding , believed to be the result of sexual intercourse that tore her uterus and other organs			0
but confusion surrounded the case from the start , with residents telling @entity51 that she had died , while officials insisted she was alive and well			0
