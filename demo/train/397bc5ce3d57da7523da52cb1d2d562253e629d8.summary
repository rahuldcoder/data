an unidentified man talks on a cell phone in front of the @entity13 family 's shop , @entity14			0
the @entity23 " ruled resoundingly in favor of the @entity13 family and denied mr. @entity20 's appeal of the case completely , " said @entity15 , an attorney for the @entity13 family , who own @entity14			1
" the @entity23 held that the trial court correctly ruled that mr. @entity26 's claims had no merit whatsoever , " he added			1
the @entity28 have " some level of relief , " @entity15 told @entity1 , " but they wo n't count mr. @entity26 out for at least trying to torment them further " with future appeals			1
" we are very happy with the result and thank everyone for supporting us , " @entity13 said in a statement issued by @entity15			0
" the past three years have been very difficult , but we hope this nightmare is finally over			0
" @entity26 initially sought $ 67 million from the @entity28 , calculating the amount by estimating years of legal violations , adding nearly $ 2 million in common law claims for fraud			1
the saga began in may 2005 , when @entity26 took several pairs of pants to @entity14 for alteration as he prepared to start his new job as an administrative law judge			1
he alleged that among them was a pair of pants from a blue and maroon suit			1
when he came to collect his clothing , he said , the @entity28 tried to give him a pair of charcoal gray pants that were not his			2
during a two - day trial , @entity26 , who represented himself , said that when he took the pants to the cleaners , his financial situation was precarious : he had just been ordered to pay $ 12,000 in attorney 's fees to his ex-wife , and his credit cards were at their limit			1
he claimed millions of dollars in attorney fees and millions more in punitive damages for what he called fraudulent advertising under the law			0
he also claimed that a sign in the store 's window promising " satisfaction guaranteed " was an unconditional warranty that required the defendants to honor any claim by any customer without limitation			0
the @entity28 ' attorney argued that no reasonable person would interpret the signs to mean an unconditional promise of satisfaction			0
@entity83 judge @entity82 agreed , ruling that @entity14 did not violate the city 's @entity84			2
manning , whose law firm handled the appeal on a pro bono basis for the @entity28 , said the @entity28 hope the " vague and often unfair " act will be changed " so that others do not suffer like they did			2
" in august 2007 , the @entity28 dropped their bid to recover legal costs in the hopes that @entity26 would drop his appeal			2
@entity26 may request that the appeal be heard again by the entire panel of @entity23 judges , @entity15 said			2
he also could petition to the @entity100 @entity99 for an appeal			1
" it is the @entity28 ' hope that mr. @entity26 will not attempt to appeal any further and will end his frivolous and baseless attacks on the @entity13 family , " @entity15 wrote in the statement			0
" the 3Â½ years this case has been pending and appealed have been very difficult for the @entity28 , " he said			0
" they lost two of their dry cleaning stores and their realization of the @entity113			0
" he said the family wants to " quietly return to their one remaining small dry - cleaning store ... to rebuild their lives			0
" @entity26 was taken off the bench in may 2007 while the lawsuit was pending and was not reappointed as an administrative law judge when his term expired			1
he filed a federal lawsuit in may 2008 to get his government job back , accusing city government and others of an " unlawful demotion and subsequent termination			1
" that suit remains pending			0
