-- authorities in the @entity13 should " retract their decision to cancel the residency permits of dozens of @entity6 who took part in a peaceful protest against the @entity6 government in @entity11 , " @entity1 said in a statement friday			1
on february 10 , more than 2000 people protested against the @entity6 regime in @entity11			1
as the demonstrators did n't have a permit to protest , @entity11 police asked them to leave			1
according to a source close to the leadership of the @entity21 , which opposes the @entity6 government , most left , but dozens stayed behind and continued protesting			1
about 60 @entity6 had their residency permits revoked , the source told @entity0 on monday			1
in their statement , @entity1 said the @entity13 canceled the residency permits of about 50 @entity6 for demonstrating			1
but a @entity13 official told @entity0 on monday that the number of @entity6 affected was much lower			1
" the decision was not to renew the residence of a few people -- much less than 60			2
it was around 30 , " said the official , who did not want to be identified			0
" it was not to deport them or to send them to @entity6			2
it was to give them the option to go anywhere they wish			0
" the official said authorities could have arrested hundreds because " the demonstration was not licensed			0
nevertheless , nobody touched anybody , nobody was arrested			0
" he added that the @entity6 who lost residency permits had been " involved in other activities " -- but would not detail what those activities were			1
in their statement , @entity1 said , " the @entity13 government has shown little tolerance for public demonstrations or strikes , regardless of whether they are peaceful			0
" in the @entity13 , gatherings and demonstrations are not allowed without a government permit			0
the source close to the @entity21 leadership told @entity0 that while the protesters who stayed " were in the wrong " for not leaving when told to do so , but " that does n't mean the @entity13 needs to cancel their residencies			1
" the source said the @entity21 has been negotiating with the @entity13 's foreign ministry and was assured last week that the permits would be reinstated -- but that has not happened			2
he said protesters are " asking for mercy from @entity13 authorities , as this wo n't just affect the men whose residencies were canceled -- but their families as well			0
" the @entity13 is one of the six @entity78 countries to have expelled @entity6 envoys and to have recalled their ambassadors from @entity6 in response to the government 's crackdown there			2
" the @entity13 calls on @entity6 president @entity88 to respect the right of peaceful protesters , yet it is expelling @entity6 from its country for exercising this basic right , " said @entity85 , @entity86 director at @entity1 , in @entity1 's statement			2
added @entity85 , " these expulsions show that @entity13 authorities are intolerant of any protest or expression of dissent on @entity13 soil even if it is not geared toward them			0
" a @entity6 who left after @entity13 officials gave him 10 days to depart told @entity0 earlier this week that he is worried about his future			1
" i lived and worked in the @entity13 for years , all my family is there			0
i never did anything wrong , " said the man who did not want to be named out of fear for his family			0
according to @entity1 , other @entity6 nationals in the @entity13 are not speaking out about their expulsion because they are afraid they will be deported to @entity6			2
the rights group said , " @entity6 protesters forced out of the @entity13 face a significant risk to their personal security if they return to @entity6			2
... the protesters also are at risk of persecution on return to @entity6 if @entity6 authorities find out they protested against the regime or the circumstances of their expulsion			1
" the source close to the @entity21 leadership , said @entity13 authorities gave the @entity6 a deadline of this past february 29 to leave the country , and that at least five have left the @entity13 in recent days -- including two to @entity127 , two to @entity128 and one to @entity129 , he said			1
the @entity13 official said the deadline is " flexible			0
" according to @entity1 , at least 10 of the protesters had to leave the @entity13 , with " some of them going to @entity127 , @entity128 , @entity129 , and @entity134			0
" the rights group added they do not have any information indicating that anyone was sent back to @entity6			0
the @entity13 official who spoke to @entity0 said none of those asked to leave the country had been deported to @entity6			1
