-- @entity1 unveiled his much - hyped , wildly - anticipated @entity3 sci - fi epic " @entity2 " to audiences in full in @entity5 thursday			1
here 's what the critics are saying about the oscar - winner 's first outing since " titanic , " the most successful film of modern times			1
@entity14 , @entity15 : the @entity16 sets his sights on creating another world entirely in " @entity2 , " and it 's very much a place worth visiting			1
... delivers unique spectacle , breathtaking sights , narrative excitement and an overarching anti-imperialist , back - to - nature theme that will play very well around the world ... " @entity28 , @entity28 : ... once again takes cinema to a new level of remarkable spectacle ... an epic film born entirely of @entity1 's imagination , " @entity2 " uses tailor - made technology to create the most astonishing visual effects yet seen on screen and blends them seamlessly into a mythical sci - fi story about an ancient alien civilization fighting the encroaching human menace			1
it 's an unprecedented marriage of technology and storytelling which is on the whole remarkably successful			2
@entity44 , @entity45 : it 's been twelve years since " titanic , " but the @entity16 has returned with a flawed but fantastic tour de force that , taken on its merits as a film , especially in two dimensions , warrants four stars			0
however , if you can wrap a pair of @entity3 glasses round your peepers , this becomes a transcendent , full - on five - star experience that 's the closest we 'll ever come to setting foot on a strange new world			1
@entity63 , @entity64 : " @entity2 " is an overwhelming , immersive spectacle			0
the state - of - the - art 3d technology draws us in , but it is the vivid weirdness of @entity1 's luridly imagined tropical otherworld that keeps us fascinated			1
at times it verges on the tacky , like a futuristic air freshener advertisement with the color contrast turned up to the max. the ethically accented orchestral score certainly does n't help matters			0
but mostly , it 's a place of wonder full of exotically freakish animal composites -- iridescent lizard birds , hammer - headed rhinos -- and sentient vegetation			2
" avatar : " we should n't really be telling you this -- but it 's good			2
@entity83 , the guardian : perhaps most surprising was the politics			0
at one stage the deranged general leading the attack , with echoes of @entity89 , declares : " our survival relies on pre-emptive action			0
we will fight terror with terror			0

@entity1 's " avatar " had its world *premiere* in @entity5 *yesterday*
