-- amid growing outrage over civilian casualties in @entity4 , there are ever more urgent calls to aid -- or at least protect -- the uprising against president @entity7			1
there is renewed talk of creating safe havens and humanitarian corridors inside the country			2
and those demanding tougher measures are again asking why events in @entity4 should not prompt @entity16 - style intervention by @entity17 and its @entity19 allies			1
in @entity22 tuesday , sen. @entity20 , @entity21 , said the @entity25 " should consider all options , including arming the opposition			2
the blood - letting has got to stop			2
" so far , the international community 's response to the violence in @entity4 has been limited			1
there has been diplomatic censure , with envoys withdrawn or " recalled for consultations , " and @entity35 ambassadors expelled from several @entity19 states			2
a growing raft of sanctions is draining the @entity35 regime 's coffers but only gradually sapping its strength			2
this is not a country that has relied on international trade for its survival			2
an @entity47 monitoring mission is in abeyance , after a much criticized few weeks on the ground that drew ridicule even from within its own ranks and fury ( for its perceived complacency ) from protesters			2
and back in november , @entity57 floated the idea of humanitarian corridors that would be protected by armed observers -- while ruling out military intervention			2
so far the idea has not gained traction			2
none of this amounts to the sort of pressure that will make the @entity7 regime buckle , especially when it perceives as divided both internal opposition and the international community			2
compare the situation to that in @entity16 -- almost a year ago			1
as then - @entity16 leader @entity74 was about to unleash his forces on the rebel stronghold of @entity77 , the world came together in the shape of the @entity79 to authorize international intervention and prevent a bloodbath			1
the @entity57 and @entity82 were prime movers behind @entity84 ; the @entity25 an enthusiastic supporter			2
@entity86 abstained , but at the time its ambassador noted that many questions remained " unanswered , including how it would be enforced and by whom , and what the limits of engagement would be			1
" @entity86 later complained that a humanitarian mandate had become a blank check in support of the rebels			1
perhaps in part because of the bad blood over @entity16 , the world body has reached no similar consensus over @entity4			1
rather , the opposite , with some of the harshest diplomatic language traded for years			2
to the @entity25 , the vetoes were a " travesty			2
" @entity107 ambassador @entity106 essentially said that @entity108 and @entity109 had @entity35 blood on their hands			1
" @entity113 and @entity86 will now have to assume that responsibility in the face of the international public opinion and especially in the @entity19 world , the @entity19 citizens and , of course , in face of the @entity35 people , " @entity106 said			1
beyond the rhetoric , the vetoes had a more practical consequence			2
@entity17 officials have made it clear that the alliance can not act , by enforcing a no - fly zone for example , without @entity79 support			0
writer @entity131 , recently in @entity4 with elements of the @entity133 , says @entity17 officials envision no role for the alliance in @entity4 this year			1
but they have not ruled out a " coalition of the willing " outside the @entity17 orbit			0
both @entity86 and @entity113 are wary of any international action supporting protest against authoritarian rule			1
and @entity4 has been first the @entity141 's -- and now @entity86 's -- key ally in the region after @entity144 ' defected ' in the 1970s			1
as it has for decades , @entity86 still supplies the @entity35 government with weapons			1
one @entity86 analyst , @entity147 , told @entity0 : " once the @entity7 regime vanishes , we have zero influence in the region			1
" according to @entity152 of the @entity153 , @entity7 has ably judged the " diplomatic red lines " to keep @entity108 onside			1
there have been no massacres on the scale of what happened in @entity160 30 years ago ( when thousands were killed after a brief uprising against his father 's rule ) that might have forced @entity86 into a corner			1
the persistent drip of civilian casualties over almost a year has not unleashed a tide of irresistible outrage			0
last weekend 's casualties in @entity172 , which opposition activists said numbered in the hundreds , may have changed that			0
but what can be done ? in @entity178 , the international community declared " safe havens " for @entity181 but failed to protect them			0
the result in july 1995 was @entity183 , the worst massacre in @entity185 since 1945 , when some 8,000 @entity187 civilians were killed by @entity189 forces			0
havens are only safe when protected against superior forces			0
others support sen. @entity20 in arguing for arming the fledgling @entity133			0
@entity193 , professor of politics and international affairs at @entity196 , told @entity0 that is " the most likely [ option ] , that the @entity47 countries , @entity199 and probably @entity17 as well arms the @entity133 , gives them the means to fight back			0
" but then you 've got a long and bloody civil war , " @entity193 says -- reminiscent of @entity178			0
analysts say that even setting aside the lack of international will , successful intervention in @entity4 would pose problems not present in @entity16 : geography : most regime targets in @entity16 were close to the @entity212 coast and within easy reach of @entity17 air bases in @entity215			1
even so , @entity17 warplanes flew some 21,000 missions over nearly six months to enforce the no - fly zone , suppress air defenses and destroy command centers and armor			0
military analysts say that , while no match for the best @entity17 members could summon , @entity35 armed forces are better equipped and coordinated than anything @entity74 could muster			0
neighboring states : few of @entity4 's neighbors would likely allow their territory to be used to pre-position supplies or military units			1
certainly neither @entity232 nor @entity233 , both countries with their own volatile sectarian mixes			0
the @entity237 militia , strongly allied with @entity4 , remains powerful within @entity233			1
the presence of foreign troops on @entity241 soil might have repercussions for a monarchy that already has plenty of problems domestically			0
using @entity247 territory would send the wrong message altogether			0
that leaves @entity199 , a @entity17 member that has run out of patience with @entity7			0
last month , the @entity199 foreign minister compared the @entity35 president with former @entity189 leader @entity254 , and on tuesday prime minister @entity255 warned @entity7 -- pointedly in @entity256 -- " what goes around , comes around			0
" @entity199 has military bases ( @entity259 , @entity260 ) close to the border that -- theoretically -- could serve as staging posts for intervention			0
but even for the @entity199 , there would be risks -- including a flood of refugees and possible retaliation by @entity269 supporting the @entity271 terrorist group active in @entity199 , the @entity272			0
topography : @entity16 was flat desert ; there was little cover for regime forces and most of the fighting was along a narrow coastal strip			1
" @entity281 acquisition " was relatively simple			0
@entity4 's physical geography is more challenging ; and much of its northern border with @entity199 and @entity233 is mountainous , with few major roads			1
getting aid into any safe havens within @entity4 would be a logistical nightmare			1
the opposition : the @entity16 rebels , for all their military shortcomings , quickly grabbed a swathe of eastern @entity16 and major air and seaports in @entity77 and @entity294 that became their resupply hubs			1
the @entity133 ( @entity133 ) , at best , controls a few neighborhoods in @entity172 and elsewhere			0
' the @entity133 has established very small slices of liberated territory , " says @entity131 , who has just left @entity300 province close to the @entity199 border			0
he says the @entity133 is poorly armed ; he was told the price of weapons on the black market has soared , " with a used @entity305 fetching as much as $ 2,000 - $ 3,000			0
" @entity131 says the @entity133 in that area wants a 5 kilometer buffer zone inside @entity4 to provide protection from regime forces			1
crucially , the regime retains control of @entity4 's frontiers , and its armed forces appear cohesive , according to analysts in the region			1
there have been military defections , mainly of low - rank conscripts , but not of entire units with their armor			0
against all this and the political risks of western military action in yet another @entity326 country , some argue there is a moral imperative -- as there was in @entity16 and @entity330 ( done ) , @entity331 ( ignored ) and @entity178 ( eventually			1
) writing last month in the @entity333 , @entity332 argued : " if there is no intervention and political will to stop @entity7 's crimes remains absent , the world will once again have to answer for standing on the sidelines of a mass murder			0
" @entity332 -- a senior fellow at the @entity341 -- asked : " at what point in the body count is international intervention deemed to be an acceptably worthwhile option that can have a positive effect on the situation ? after @entity7 has killed 6,000 people ? 7,000 ? 10,000 ? 20,000 ? " scholar @entity349 agrees , telling @entity0 's @entity351 : " not just the @entity86 and @entity113 , shame to the rest of us			1
there 's abdication elsewhere , by the @entity199 nearby , abdication by the @entity47 and @entity22			0
@entity22 spent an enormous amount of time chasing after the false mirage [ that ] maybe we can get the @entity86 and @entity113 on board			1
" some also argue that , despite the price , there would also eventually be a strategic gain : a post-al - @entity4 would unlikely be as close to @entity365 as is the current regime and might also deprive @entity237 of critical regional support			1
others see the risks of international intervention as outweighing any benefits , with the danger that civil war would inevitably spill into @entity233			0
in an interview with @entity0 's @entity377 tuesday , @entity25 ambassador to the @entity79 @entity375 preferred tighter and more coordinated sanctions , saying that " our strong preference is not to fuel what has the potential to become a full - blown civil war " by arming the opposition			2
diplomats expect a new " contact group " on @entity4 to involve at least the @entity25 , @entity57 , the @entity47 and @entity199			2
" we think that the @entity7 regime is on its last legs , that the pressure is increasing , the economy is crumbling , " @entity386 said			0
@entity35 may already be discounting direct intervention by the @entity392			0
in one @entity395 video uploaded tuesday from @entity172 , a doctor pleads for help from abroad			0
but he directs his message to the leaders of @entity199 , @entity399 and @entity400 .			0

the @entity403 ' response to violence in @entity4 *differs* from its response in @entity16
@entity408 ambassador : blood on hands of @entity113 , @entity86
@entity412 has ably judged the " diplomatic red lines " to keep @entity108 on its side , says @entity152
