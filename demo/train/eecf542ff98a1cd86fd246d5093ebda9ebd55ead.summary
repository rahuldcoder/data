-- why only reach back to right a wrong from a half - century ago ? why not correct a travesty that is occurring right now ? i direct this question to president @entity4 , who in march will award the @entity5 -- the nation 's highest military honor for valor -- to a group of 24 veterans , only three still living , who should have been given the commendation decades ago			1
the men , who served over three wars , performed as heroes on the battlefield			2
but for 19 of the 24 , the nation failed them			2
they had been passed over because of discrimination in the ranks			0
the belated recognition is a wonderful gesture			0
but there is something more @entity4 should do			0
the nation owes a @entity5 to sgt. @entity26 , a 25 - year - old @entity27 from @entity28 who died on november 15 , 2004 , when , according to many accounts , he smothered a grenade in @entity31 , @entity32			1
he came to the @entity33 as an immigrant from @entity35 , and joined the @entity27 on the day he received his green card			0
absorbing a grenade blast to save other soldiers is the very definition of valor			1
it all but guarantees the @entity5			1
this was true for three other heroes : 22 - year - old @entity27 cpl. @entity44 , who died this way on april 22 , 2004 , in @entity46 , @entity32 ; 19 - year - old @entity48 pvt. @entity47 , who died in @entity49 on december 4 , 2006 ; and 25 - year - old @entity52 seal @entity50 , who died in @entity53 , @entity32 , on september 29 , 2006			1
in @entity26 's case , before the @entity27 covered the grenade , he had been shot in the head			1
and that fact fuels a debate			0
there are those who believe that @entity26 should not receive the @entity5 , claiming that the gunshot killed him instantly , and so he was already dead when he covered the grenade			1
that would make the smothering of the explosive an involuntary action that would not constitute heroism			0
that group includes the last three secretaries of defense			0
recently , the @entity70 announced that it will not reopen the nomination for @entity26			1
according to a news release , defense secretary @entity72 and the @entity70 concluded that the evidence did not meet the " beyond a reasonable doubt " standard necessary for the @entity5			1
those who think that @entity26 should get the @entity5 acknowledge that the @entity27 sergeant was shot but , point to assertions by a neurologist , two neurosurgeons and the surgeon for @entity26 's battalion that the bullet was traveling at such a low velocity that it did not kill him instantly			1
they assert that he was able to reach out , scoop up the grenade , and place it under his body			2
that it was a conscious decision to give up his life to save comrades , and that it does amount to heroism			1
i 've looked at this case for several years and written about it numerous times			0
i believe @entity26 deserves the @entity5			1
this is also the point of view of the entire @entity103 congressional delegation , which pushed the @entity70 for years to reopen the nomination			0
( @entity106 rep. @entity106 , himself a @entity27 combat veteran who presumably knows a thing or two about valor , led the push			0
) and it 's also the view of @entity115 pathologist @entity114 , an independent forensic expert who looked at the evidence and reached a different conclusion than the one arrived at by the @entity70			0
and , it 's the opinion of the @entity27 , the @entity52 and @entity120			0
furthermore , it is also the point of view of the real experts on what happened that day in @entity31 : @entity26 's comrades in @entity126 , most of who joined the campaign for the @entity5			1
and they do n't need some bureaucrat behind a desk in @entity134 or some political appointee to tell them what happened			2
they saw it with their own eyes			0
initially , all seven said they witnessed @entity26 scoop up the grenade and sacrifice himself , and that it 's because of that act of valor that they came home to their families , to weddings and children 's birthday parties and anniversaries but the @entity153 last week reported that two former @entity27 who were with @entity26 on the day he died have broken ranks with their colleagues			1
at least one is recanting his earlier statements			0
the two former @entity27 claim that the narrative about what happened that day advanced by the other @entity27 is not true , and that it was concocted by the rest of the squad to honor @entity26 's memory			1
they insist that the grenade exploded near @entity165 but not underneath him			2
one of the former @entity27 , 30 - year - old @entity166 , who was close enough to @entity26 to be wounded in the blast , spent years advancing the other version , and now he claims the new version is the truth			1
was he not telling the truth then , or is he not telling it now ? both rep. @entity106 and the @entity26 family have challenged the @entity153 article , which they insist contains inaccuracies and factual omissions			1
while admitting in a letter to the @entity153 that the eyewitness accounts " have always differed , " @entity106 accused the newspaper of ignoring " the full body of evidence " and inaccurately describing the situation that day in @entity31			2
moreover , according to @entity182 , the allegation that @entity26 's fellow @entity27 concocted an alternate narrative had already been reported in the @entity185			1
yet a colonel assigned to investigate the case found no evidence to back up that claim			0
it comes down to whom you believe			0
this much everyone seems to agree on : those in the @entity195 used to call @entity26 " a @entity27 's @entity27			2
" it sounds like it			0
there is one more member of the @entity200 , an expected one : the @entity70			0
in 2008 , as pressure started to mount , defense secretary @entity202 offered the @entity26 family a consolation prize : the @entity206			2
the citation read : " without hesitation and with complete disregard for his own personal safety , sgt. @entity26 reached out and pulled the grenade to his body			1
that 's right -- the very thing that his supporters have insisted all along			0
so the @entity70 adopts different narratives depending on the commendation ? that makes no sense			0
the @entity26 family turned down the @entity206 , and held out for the @entity5			1
president @entity4 , you do n't have to look back a half - century to find a miscarriage of justice in our armed forces			2
here is a perfect example			0
now , do the right thing , and give a hero the recognition he deserves			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity235 .			2

@entity235 : sgt. @entity26 , who died in @entity32 , deserves the @entity5
he says @entity26 , by many accounts , smothered a grenade to save comrades
some said @entity26 , who was shot , could n't have done it consciously
@entity235 : many , including his comrades , think he deserves the medal
