-- two tainted lots of a generic version of a drug reportedly taken by @entity4 have been recalled by the drug maker			1
however , no link has been established between the drug -- a powerful sedative and anesthetic called propofol -- and the singer 's death			1
" i have no way of knowing anything related to this specific product -- if it might have played a role or not played a role , " said dr. @entity12 , the chief investigator on the recall for the @entity14			2
the agency is not involved in the investigation into @entity4 's death , he said			1
the @entity14 issued a health advisory monday , saying two lots of a generic version of the drug had tested positive for endotoxin , a contaminant			1
the drug maker , @entity29 , voluntarily recalled the lots			0

@entity4 died june 25 of cardiac arrest			0
the exact cause of death is pending toxicology results			0
all of the people who had taken propofol recovered ; only one was hospitalized and that patient was quickly discharged , he said			0
but , he added , " at high doses , endotoxin can absolutely cause lowered blood pressure and much more serious reactions			0
" " it can cause decreases in blood pressure , which could precipitate problems with your heart			0
" the manufacturer , @entity29 , is working with the @entity63 to determine how the contamination occurred and is voluntarily recalling the affected lots , he said			2
a spokeswoman for @entity29 said about 57,000 vials were included in the recall of the drug , and said the company had been contacted by the @entity71			2
" i can say the @entity71 did contact us about a specific lot number , and that lot number is not from the two we are recalling , " said spokeswoman @entity72			1
she would not say whether the contact was related to the @entity4 investigation			0
a @entity71 spokesman did not immediately return a call seeking comment			0

@entity99 , an online news organization , first reported a possible link between @entity4 's death and the drug recall on tuesday			1
but an @entity63 spokeswoman denied there could have been a link			0
" this is fever , chills , " said @entity106			0
" does that sound like heart failure ? " she said at least three companies make the generic version of the drug and only one of them -- @entity117 -- makes @entity86 , the brand - name version			1
" we do n't know what was at @entity4 's house , but i 'm guessing it was diprivan because that 's what the reporting has been , " @entity118 said			2

it would not cause heart failure			0
" authorities have said the cause of @entity4 's heart failure will not be determined officially until toxicology tests are complete .			2
