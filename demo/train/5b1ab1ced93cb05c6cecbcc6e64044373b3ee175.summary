-- @entity1 has called it the biggest change to the @entity3 since the very first one launched in 2007 , but does the latest software , @entity5 7 , make the @entity3 a more compelling buy for travelers than its @entity9 - and @entity10 - powered competitors ? while @entity13 sports a significant redesign alongside improved battery life and multitasking ability , it 's the assortment of new photo functions that @entity3 - toting tourists will find most useful in the @entity13 update			1
the big deal is a faster , easier way to scroll through that endless stream of photos you 've amassed over the years and trips			1
in previous versions , those photos all existed as part of one , big linear stream			2
the @entity13 automatically organizes photos into categories called collections , moments and years , what @entity1 describes as " smart groupings of your photos and videos based on time and place			1
" collections is a grouping of moments -- say , a trip to @entity43			0
moments are organized according to date and location			0
years are obvious -- groupings of photos by year			2
the cool part of the years organization is a collage of thumbnails of every picture from a given year that appears on the user screen			0
this can look a little overwhelming -- the more photos , the more intricate the collage -- but it 's actually a handy way to find images quickly			2
a redesigned photo share panel adds a number of functions that users should welcome			0
the most useful is a new @entity64 that not only allows the user to share photos with others , but allows others to add photos to someone else 's photo stream			0
just back from a family vacation in @entity73 ? in the past you might have streamed all of your vacation photos to family members -- with the @entity13 , those same family members can now add their photos to the same stream			1
@entity82 app another key asset is the new built - in @entity82 app , which will now include spoken turn - by - turn navigation for pedestrians			1
instead of bumbling down @entity87 or @entity88 , eyes glued to an app and smacking into other people , wandering tourists can pocket their iphones , stick in an earbud and listen out for the next turn , in the same way drivers use sat - nav apps -- and similar to how @entity99 works on @entity9 smartphones			1
the @entity101 on @entity93 with @entity13 will also incorporate gps location to suggest locally popular apps , which is potentially useful for first - time visits to an area -- for example , firing up the @entity101 in @entity109 's @entity108 district shows two bus schedule apps and a " taxi translator " that gives the names of streets and places in phonetically spelled @entity115			1
other minor traveler - friendly refreshes include an enhanced camera with vintage filters and a square viewfinder mode -- all the better to share those holiday snaps on @entity122 ; and additional security for a lost @entity3 that prevents would - be thieves from erasing it in order to sell it			2
passbook now a bigger plus an app that launched with last year 's @entity129 software remains one of the @entity3 's biggest travel boons			2
passbook is a travel wallet app that holds digital boarding passes , hotel confirmations and other booking tickets , then uses the @entity3 's gps sensor to pop up the required boarding pass around the location of use			0
though it launched with relatively few airlines and hotels on - board , the app now supports boarding passes for dozens of airlines and travel companies , including @entity147 and @entity148			1
of course , boarding pass apps , trip organizers and other travel helpers are readily available on @entity9 ( and to a lesser extent , @entity152 and @entity153 )			0
for now , @entity126 is an advantage only for multi-stop trips where travelers are likely to be carrying more than a couple of boarding passes or hotel bookings at a time			0
should existing @entity3 users upgrade to @entity13 ? " software updates fix bugs , enhance performance and add new features , " says @entity163 , editor in chief of consumer tech blog @entity165			0
" it 's up to developers then to take advantage of the new tools in their apps			0
" users of the @entity3 , @entity177 and @entity178 will be prompted by @entity1 to update sometime this month , while @entity13 will be available for the second - , third - and fourth - generation @entity179 plus the @entity180 later in the year ( rumored to be october )			1
as for whether an @entity3 packing @entity13 is a worthy alternative to the slew of other smartphones , it comes back down to those nice new photo / camera features and the apps			1
great travel apps for @entity3 such as @entity188 flight booking and @entity190 guides are usually also available for @entity9 , while major apps such as @entity193 travel organizer and @entity195 calling will also support @entity153 and @entity152			0
for current @entity3 owners , @entity13 will make photo organization simpler , but it wo n't revolutionize their next trip away -- the next generation of @entity13 apps could			1
@entity0 's @entity201 contributed to this report .			0

new @entity13 offers easier way to sort and scroll through photos -- a big plus
@entity101 suggests locally popular apps
older @entity211 app is still the best travel - related *resource*
another new feature -- turn - by - turn audio navigation for walkers
