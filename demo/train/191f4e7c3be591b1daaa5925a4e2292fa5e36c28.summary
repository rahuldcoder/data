-- embattled former district attorney @entity1 was held in criminal contempt of court and sentenced to one day in jail friday for his actions in the flawed @entity6 lacrosse team rape case			1
@entity1 walks into the courtroom during his criminal contempt hearing in @entity9 , @entity10 , on friday			2
@entity1 must report to jail september 7 , superior court judge @entity11 said			1
the judge said @entity1 's withholding of dna evidence from defense attorneys was an affront to the integrity of the judicial system			2
the evidence potentially would have cleared the three lacrosse players of sexual assault charges months before @entity10 's attorney general dropped them in april			1
the players initially were accused of raping an exotic dancer during a party last year			1
the specific evidence @entity1 was accused of withholding was that @entity15 profiles found on the alleged rape victim were from unidentified males , but did not match any of the 46 lacrosse team members			1
he also was accused of telling the court in a september 22 hearing that a lab report contained complete information on dna test results , when it omitted that information			1
attorneys for the players contend @entity1 became aware of the test results in april 2006 , but collaborated with the director of the lab conducting the tests to produce a report that did not contain all the test results			1
@entity1 also made " multiple material misrepresentations to multiple courts on multiple occasions , " the motion says			2
the defense team did not learn of the results until october			0
" the court expects , and well it should , to be able to rely on the representation of lawyers , " @entity11 told @entity1			2
earlier friday , @entity1 testified in his defense , saying he and the lab director had agreed not to put the players ' dna profiles in the report out of privacy concerns , but said he thought the lab report was in fact complete when it was not			1
he acknowledged , however , that he had not read the report in its entirety before making the claim in court			0
" all the statements that i made to the court ... i believed to be true , " @entity1 testified			0
he said it was his practice when prosecuting cases to turn over all his information to defense attorneys , regardless of whether it would help or hurt a defendant			0
" there was no reason not to , " he said			0
" if there was a piece of evidence that helped the defendant , you had to turn that over anyway			0
if it was a piece of evidence that hurt the defendant , why not turn it over ? because he might realize at that point that it was in his best interest to take a plea			0
" before @entity1 was sentenced , another @entity91 judge , former @entity92 district attorney @entity90 , testified on his behalf			1
" i always felt like i could take him at his word , his word was his bond , " @entity90 said			0
" basically , if he told you something , you could take it to the bank			0
" a disciplinary committee of the @entity101 disbarred @entity1 in june , concluding after a hearing that he violated the majority of at least 19 ethics offenses in his handling of the case			1
the allegations against the players forced the cancellation of the @entity6 lacrosse team 's season and cost coach @entity112 his job			1
the case also inflamed racial tensions in @entity9			0
the three players are white , while the alleged victim is black			0
the three players -- @entity117 , @entity117 and @entity117 -- initially were charged with first - degree kidnapping and first - degree sexual offense after a team party in march 2006			2
an initial charge of first - degree forcible rape was dropped in december 2006 after the players ' accuser told prosecutors she could no longer say for certain that she had been penetrated with a penis -- one of the defining factors of rape under @entity10 law			0
the @entity15 issue also was a factor in eliminating the charge			0
in april , state attorney general @entity134 dropped all charges against the three , saying the case was a result of @entity1 's " rush to accuse			1
" @entity1 had asked @entity134 to assign a special prosecutor to the case after the state bar filed its complaint against him			2

the former district attorney must report to jail september 7
a disciplinary committee disbarred @entity1 in june for handling of @entity6 case
three lacrosse players initially were accused of raping a woman during a party
all charges against the players were dropped in april
