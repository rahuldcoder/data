-- months before my son was born , i began searching for a nanny			0
the prospect of leaving my first child home with a stranger while my husband and i worked was n't ideal , but the only day care center in our neighborhood had a year - long wait list and our families were n't in a position to help			1
entrusting @entity15 , now 12 , to a babysitter seemed like our only option			0
the catastrophic story unfolding in @entity19 of a nanny who has been arrested for stabbing to death two young children she was paid to care for is unimaginable for any parent			1
while i could never have envisioned anything as demonic as what 50 - year - old @entity25 is now accused of , i was anxious in those early weeks nearly every morning before i left for work : would our new nanny shake my son if he cried ? would she scald him accidently , even intentionally , when she bathed him ? i was so concerned that my husband and i installed nanny - cams around our apartment and hired a private company to perform criminal background checks			1
the @entity34 family likely followed their own safety checklist and never could have anticipated such a horror either			0
their tragedy highlights the question turning in the pit of every parent 's stomach : is my child truly safe with this woman ? ms. @entity25 was hardly a stranger to the husband and wife who hired her			1
on the mother 's blog ( which has since been taken offline ) she apparently wrote about spending more than a week visiting with her nanny 's family in the @entity53			1
" we spent the past 9 days in the @entity53			0
we spent half the time at our nanny , @entity58 's sisters home in @entity59 , " she reportedly wrote			1
" we met @entity58 's amazing familia ! ! ! and the @entity53 is a wonderful country ! ! more pics to come ! ! " as soon as i heard news of this story , it reminded me of the @entity67 piece written by @entity68 in 2007 about her babysitter , @entity69			0
@entity70 cared for @entity68 's two sons , but went on to become a nurse in @entity73 who was later convicted of assaulting two patients , poisoning one of them			0
one day when @entity68 's son was 5 , he confided in her that he did n't want @entity69 to come anymore			2
" @entity69 scares me , " @entity79 told her			0
@entity79 was never hurt , but her son 's words and her nanny 's reaction to them made @entity68 start thinking that something was n't quite right with @entity69			1
how can any family really know all there is to know about their nanny ? nanny - cams ca n't see into a person 's soul and mental illness wo n't necessarily show up on a background check			1
i asked @entity95 's @entity94 what parents can do during a nanny search to make the best ( and safest ) choices			2
the agency recommends obtaining a prospective caregiver 's school records , criminal history , credit background and driving record			2
@entity19 parents have access to this information in part because of @entity110 , passed in 1998 and named for @entity111 , a 10 - month - old boy who died in 1993 after a nanny threw him across a room			1
while all of the above might be helpful , the guidelines seem utterly toothless in the face of the evil we 've seen in @entity19			2
the @entity119 could have done everything in their power to investigate their nanny before hiring her -- and none of the research could have predicted a mental snap of such massive proportions			0
my son grew up unscathed and developed a loving relationship with our nanny			0
and two years later when our daughter was born , our nanny was still with us , providing love and much - needed support			0
the opinions expressed are solely those of @entity135 .			2

a @entity19 nanny was arrested for *allegedly* stabbing two children to death
@entity135 describes her fear when entrusting her children to a nanny
background checks are a good idea but ca n't *guarantee* a child 's safety
