@entity0 -- the jury in the phone hacking trial of former newspaper editor and @entity7 communications chief @entity6 has been discharged after it could not reach a verdict on the final charges in the case , a court official said wednesday			1
@entity12 editor @entity6 was convicted tuesday of conspiracy to hack phones between 2000 and 2006			1
but the jury was not able to reach a decision wednesday on two charges each of conspiring to commit misconduct in a public office against @entity6 and the paper 's former royal editor , @entity19			1
the court said that a decision on a retrial for these charges would be made monday			1
another of @entity27 's former newspaper chiefs , @entity26 , was unanimously cleared of all charges tuesday after the eight - month trial at the @entity31 court			1
shortly before the jury was discharged , the judge in the case , @entity32 , issued an unusual rebuke to prime minister @entity36 and " a large number of politicians from all parties " for commenting on the case after the partial verdicts tuesday			1
" i consider that what has happened is unsatisfactory so far as justice and the rule of law are concerned , " @entity32 said in his ruling			0
" the press in court have been extremely responsible in their reporting of this case but when politicians regard it as open season , one can not expect the press to remain silent			1
" the ruling followed an application for the jury to be discharged on the basis that it was no longer possible for @entity6 and @entity19 to have a fair trial because of those comments			1
but the judge said he had decided not to discharge the jury on those grounds			2
" i am satisfied that the jury will continue to try mr. @entity6 and mr. @entity19 on the evidence that they have heard in court and solely on that evidence , " he said			1
a spokesman for the prime minister 's office said that @entity36 had taken the " best legal advice " before giving a statement tuesday			1
@entity36 : ' wrong decision ' speaking before the @entity72 on wednesday , @entity36 repeated the apology he 'd made a day earlier for hiring @entity6 as his director of communications in 2007			2
" i am sorry , this was the wrong decision , but i think it 's right that we 've had a public inquiry in this country , and it 's right that we have proper investigations , " he said			0
" yesterday once again showed that no one is above the law in our country			0
" public and political outrage over the hacking revelations led to the closure of the 168 - year - old @entity12 paper and the setting up of a public inquiry to examine journalistic ethics , known as the @entity92 , as well as a police investigation			2
in a statement wednesday , @entity94 , the @entity95 assistant commissioner who oversaw the investigation , said it had been " complex and challenging " -- and that officers involved had been aware of the " sensitivities " of investigating a national newspaper and confidential journalistic material			0
" this investigation has never been about an attack on press freedom but one to establish whether any criminal offenses had been committed , to establish who was responsible for committing them and to bring them to justice			0
the victims deserved no less , " she said			2
" along with the verdicts , i hope this will give some comfort to the many victims that justice has been served			1
" the @entity95 investigation into phone hacking , which was launched in january 2011 and dubbed @entity119 , identified 5,500 victims			2
of those , 3,500 have been contacted , a police statement said			2
the investigation involved sifting through millions of e-mails , tens of thousands of documents , other data communications and financial transactions , it said			0
murdered schoolgirl tuesday 's verdicts came three years after it was revealed that journalists on @entity132 hacked the voice mail of then - missing teenager @entity134 in 2002 , raising hopes that she was alive and checking messages , when in fact she had been murdered			0
at the time the schoolgirl 's voice mail was intercepted , @entity141 was editor of @entity144 's top - selling @entity132 , and @entity6 was her deputy			1
after @entity6 succeeded her as editor , @entity141 edited @entity148 newspaper , and she later became chief executive of the parent company , @entity150 -- now known as @entity150			1
@entity6 resigned as @entity12 editor in 2007 after its then - royal editor , @entity19 , and a private investigator , @entity154 , were jailed for hacking into voice - mail messages left for royal aides			1
@entity6 denied any wrongdoing and later became @entity36 's director of communications			2
the former editor resigned from his @entity161 position in 2011 as coverage of the phone hacking scandal broadened			0
' wrongdoing occurred ' besides a charge of conspiracy to hack voice mails , @entity141 also was accused of conspiring to pervert the course of justice , as was her husband , @entity141 , and her former personal assistant , @entity172			0
all three were cleared of those charges , the @entity173 reported , as was former @entity150 head of security @entity176			0
retired managing editor @entity178 was cleared of conspiracy to hack phones			0
five people pleaded guilty to phone hacking charges before the case came to trial , the police said			1
they were @entity154 , @entity186 , @entity187 , @entity188 and @entity189			0
@entity150 , the @entity144 newspaper publishing arm of @entity27 's @entity190 , said in a statement : " we said long ago , and repeat today , that wrongdoing occurred , and we apologized for it			0
we have been paying compensation to those affected and have cooperated with investigations			0
" the publisher said it was making changes to ensure this kind of wrongdoing did not recur and that it supported a new @entity144 press watchdog expected to start work later this year			0
@entity1 's @entity204 and @entity205 contributed to this report .			0
