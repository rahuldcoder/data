@entity0 -- of the many challenges @entity3 faces in its progression towards global economic leadership over the next 15 years , one of the biggest is the food , water and air security of its 1.35 billion people			1
it needs to confront this issue with the same zeal and determination it has shown in pursuing economic growth since the 1980s because the environmental downside of that success is the widespread contamination of its soil , water and air -- with costly consequences for the health and safety of its people			1
@entity3 has less than 10 % of the world 's cultivated land and only 7 % of its potable water , but must seek to feed almost 20 % of the world 's population , according to the @entity32 ( @entity32 )			1
@entity40 and other parts of northeastern @entity3 are already water - stressed , the air quality in inland mega-cities such as @entity38 and @entity39 is abysmal , farming land is being poisoned by toxic runoff from mining and industrial activities , acid rain blights large parts of south @entity3 , contagious disease is an ever - present risk among its livestock , and unscrupulous makers sell tainted foodstuffs			1
when natural disasters such as drought , floods , earthquakes and landslides are factored in , the food security picture for @entity3 can start to look very bleak indeed			1
at the same time , new demographic and social pressures are emerging : @entity3 's people are living longer and eating more , according to the @entity59 population growth and economic prosperity are driving demand for water - intensive and protein - rich food such as meat and dairy			1
that in turn means farmers must produce more soybeans and corn for animal feed , or import what they ca n't grow			0
the speed of the middle class consumption boom is so swift that unless @entity3 takes decisive steps soon to re-engineer its food and water usage patterns and supply chains , and commits to a massive greening of its industrial landscape , it risks social dislocation that could undo much of its progress			1
food price inflation in the big cities -- @entity3 has 160 cities with populations above 1 million -- could trigger unrest			2
@entity3 's current five - year plan puts considerable emphasis on resource conservation and environmental improvements , but time is not on the side of the new leaders about to take office			1
still , @entity3 has faced existential challenges before			2
fifty years ago , it emerged from the most catastrophic famine in its history , when drought , floods and @entity103 's disastrous @entity102 experiment in agrarian collectivization claimed the lives of an estimated 30 million to 45 million people between 1958 - 62			1
multiple factors allowed @entity3 to recover from those terrible years , including replacing ideology with pragmatism and giving farmers a chance to produce extra crops for themselves			2
since then , better farming practices , improved seeds , more mechanization and information , and smoother supply chains have all helped @entity3 in its quest for food security			2
so too have offshore food investments in @entity121 , @entity122 , the @entity123 and @entity124 -- though managing local reaction to these investments carries its own challenges			0
today @entity3 is both the biggest producer and consumer of wheat , rice , meat , fish , vegetables and fruit			2
but it falls short in animal feed			0
although @entity3 produces 15 million tons of soybeans a year , demand is so high that it must import four times that amount from the @entity140 and @entity141			1
by 2015 it could be importing 80 million tons a year , while corn imports could reach 20 million tons , according to @entity144 research and forecasts by food companies such as @entity147 and @entity148			0
on the food safety front , @entity3 consumers scarred by the melamine poisoned milk and tainted meat scandals of the past few years are demanding better quality controls			2
they are alert , too , to any disease outbreaks in @entity3 's vast stock of pigs and chickens			1
and bubbling in the background is @entity3 's problem of water contamination and over-use			1
according to @entity32 statistics , only @entity163 uses more water			0
by the time @entity3 's population reaches 1.6 billion around 2030 , average water availability will have dropped from 2,195 cubic meters per person a year to just 1,760 m3 , the @entity59 says			1
the @entity32 defines stress conditions as below 1,700 m3 , with chronic scarcity below 1,000 m3 and absolute scarcity below 500 m3			0
already @entity40 , @entity172 , @entity173 and @entity174 are at " extreme risk , " according to the @entity176 compiled by global risk analyst @entity177			0
clearly , @entity3 has a lot of issues to handle			2
but with the right policies , it has the chance both to enhance its food security and rejuvenate its environment			0
@entity185 in the 1990s showed how an industrial , heavily - polluted landscape could be re-greened , and how big cities such as @entity188 and @entity189 could clean up their air and waterways			0
reduce , reuse , recycle has to be @entity3 's resources mantra			1
farmers must further refine growing cycles to be more water - efficient			0
supply chains between farms and urban tables must run faster and keep wastage to a minimum			0
there is one more " @entity204 " in the mix - reform			0
@entity206 must lead the reform effort , to address corruption and criminal behavior in the food supply chain			0
as well , there are three " is " -- innovation , infrastructure and investment -- for the leadership to focus on			0
there needs to be greater innovation to improve food safety , more investment on infrastructure to upgrade food and water distribution and waste disposal systems , and a proactive approach to long - range investment in domestic and overseas food assets			0
failure to preserve @entity3 's environment will be costly in multiple ways			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity231 .			0

@entity3 has less than 10 % of the world 's cultivated land and only 7 % of its potable water
pressure *increasing* as @entity3 's people are living longer and eating more , according to @entity59
@entity3 's current five - year plan emphasizes resource conservation , environmental improvement
@entity243 : @entity244 is not on the side of the new leaders about to take office
