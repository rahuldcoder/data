editor 's note : in 1994 , the @entity2 published the fourth edition of the @entity4 , or @entity5 is the standard classification of mental disorders used by mental health professionals in the @entity9			1
for the several years doctors around the country have been working to update the manual			2
the @entity13 is expected to be published in may 2013 , and the proposed changes to the definition of autism have caused some controversy			2
dr. @entity18 is one of the doctors working on revising that chapter			2
my e-mail invitation to be a part of the @entity13 revision process came on january 4 , 2007			0
at the time , i was told that the work would be completed in 2011 and that participation would not be too burdensome			0
the process could be accomplished primarily through e-mails and conference calls , with in - person meetings held sparingly			0
it 's interesting to reflect on the fact that when the ink was drying on the last version of the @entity5 in 1994 , e-mail and the internet as we know it were still evolving			1
in the nearly two decades since @entity4 -- such roman numerals suggest a chiseling in stone , do n't they ? -- there have been significant advances in technology and medicine , significant advances in our understanding of neuroscience and even changes in the significance of the @entity5 itself			1
there are good reasons to change the @entity5 and perhaps some good reasons to leave it alone			1
the manual has evolved over time from a relatively small guide for the collection of diagnostic prevalence data to the standard text for every course on psychiatric illness throughout the world			2
it has also become the dominant coding guide for insurance companies , schools and other agencies responsible for covering or creating special provisions for individuals with developmental or mental disorders			1
whether someone receives the death penalty or a lesser sentence can rise or fall on whether he met criteria for a disorder as defined in the @entity5			1
every psychiatrist has an opinion about the @entity5 , and it typically includes both love and hate			1
in child psychiatry in particular , it is often said that children must not have read the @entity5 , because their symptoms so rarely seem to fit neatly into one of the diagnoses , often straddling several			1
our advances in knowledge over the years clearly support efforts to improve the process , but we need to be particularly careful that we do no harm			0
now five years in to this " nonburdensome " process , our work group has spent nearly 2,500 person - hours in meetings and another 3,500 hours on teleconferences discussing refinements to the diagnostic criteria for autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders			1
and ours is just one of the smaller chapters in this manual			0
work groups focused on mood disorders , personality disorders , anxiety disorders and so on are equally invested in this process			2
as a group of clinician scientists who have devoted our professional lives to the problem of autism and related disorders , we 've been given an extraordinary opportunity to update and improve how autism spectrum disorder , or @entity113 , is diagnosed			1
every decision has been considered from multiple perspectives to determine the potential impact on individuals with the disorder			0
we 've even taken the step of posting iterations of the possible changes online for professional and public comment			0
the goal here is not to settle or vote on what is most popular , but to be sure to leverage the collective experience and wisdom of professionals , patients and everyone in between to minimize unanticipated consequences from potential change -- to ensure that we do no harm			0
we are also directly testing , in trials , how the new criteria will perform			0
we are specifically looking at whether or not people who currently have appropriate @entity113 diagnoses might be affected by this change			1
our preliminary look at the field trial data suggests that the lines around the autism spectrum disorders will not be significantly redrawn with @entity13			1
as we get closer to finalizing this revision of the @entity5 , there is understandable concern about whether some individuals will " lose " their diagnoses			1
there is no question that some diagnoses will change			2
for example , @entity152 's disorder will become autism spectrum disorder			1
but the goal here is finding the best way to capture the symptoms and problems that an individual has , to map those symptoms onto disorders that are valid , and which then inform prognosis and treatment and further study			0
we have a ways to go before the love - hate relationship we clinicians have with the @entity5 changes much			2
i am certain that children will continue to challenge our diagnostic constructs with their complexity , and i know that we will want to resist chiseling @entity13 criteria into stone			0
but i also believe that by refining the diagnostic criteria to reflect current science , we 're that much closer to getting it right			0
perhaps that will make the next revision less burdensome			0
in any case , when the invitation comes for working on the next @entity5 , it would be wise -- as for any significant remodeling project -- to double the estimate for time to completion			2
dr. @entity18 is the director at the @entity187 and director of child and adolescent psychiatry at the @entity191 and @entity192			0
on @entity193 , @entity18 and other medical experts at the @entity187 share information and perspectives for those raising a child with autism .			0

@entity4 ( @entity5 ) helps decide coverage *benefits* for developmental disorders
doctors are updating it but there 's concern that some people will " lose " their diagnoses
expert : there are good reasons to change the @entity5 as well as good ones to leave it alone
early data suggests that the lines around autism spectrum disorders wo n't be significantly redrawn , says expert
