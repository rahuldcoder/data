-- she said she was a scapegoat			0
she said she was just following orders			0
she said she was demoted unfairly			0
retired army col. @entity4 was one of two officers punished over @entity6			1
now , retired @entity7 col. @entity4 can say : i told you so			1
@entity4 was one of two officers punished over the aggressive interrogations at the notorious @entity12 in @entity13			1
pictures of detainees caused outrage around the world when they were leaked to the news media in may 2004			0
the photos showed naked prisoners stacked on top of each other or being threatened by dogs or hooded and wired up as if for electrocution			1
throughout the ordeal , @entity4 maintained that she and her troops were following interrogation guidelines approved by top brass			1
today , @entity4 has found validation in a few @entity31 - era memos released last week by the @entity33 administration			1
" the outrage was over the photographs , because the photographs were living color of what those top - secret memorandums authorized , " @entity4 said in an interview wednesday			1
" so , it is unfair ... the soldiers may have moved through [ the military justice ] system , but they never had a fair court - martial			0
not any one of them , because they were condemned as one of the ' bad apples			0
' " @entity4 , then a brigadier general and commander of @entity6 , was demoted to colonel because of the scandal			1
a second officer , col. @entity53 , the commander of the military intelligence unit assigned to @entity6 when the offenses occurred , was relieved of duty and fined in may 2005			1
seven low - ranking guards and two military intelligence soldiers -- described by then - deputy secretary of defense @entity59 as " bad apples " -- were disciplined			1
the memo , by then - assistant attorney general @entity61 and then - principal deputy assistant attorney general @entity62 , allowed the use of such tactics as keeping a detainee naked and in some cases in a diaper , and putting detainees on a liquid diet			2
one memo said aggressive techniques such as waterboarding , sleep deprivation and slapping did not violate laws against torture absent the intent to cause severe pain			0
" i will tell you that when i read those memorandums , when they were first released a few days ago , i did -- i did feel this sense of being able to exhale after five years , " @entity4 said			2
" that is what we have been saying from the very beginning , that , wait a minute , why are you inside pointing the finger at me , why are you pointing the fingers at the soldiers here ? there 's a bigger story here			0
" the @entity93 released a report tuesday , five days after the memos were released , stating that senior @entity31 administration officials authorized aggressive interrogation techniques on suspected terrorists , despite concerns from military psychologists and attorneys			1
the report points to then - defense secretary @entity104 's approval of such techniques -- including stress positions , removal of clothing , use of phobias ( such as fear of dogs ) , and deprivation of light and auditory stimuli -- in december 2002 for detainees at the @entity118 prison in @entity119 , @entity120			0
his ok prompted interrogators in @entity122 and @entity13 to adopt the aggressive techniques			0
the guidance was delivered to @entity6 by then - maj. gen. @entity125 , who was summoned to @entity126 from @entity119 to evaluate the prison system			2
" we had a myriad of problems in our -- in the prison system , not with detainees who were undergoing interrogations , but with @entity13 criminal prisoners , " @entity4 said			1
" and instead of coming to give us support , he was sent specifically to work with the military intelligence interrogators to teach them the harsher techniques that were being used down in @entity119			0
" shortly before he left office in late 2006 , @entity104 said the day the @entity6 scandal broke was the worst in his tenure as defense secretary			2
" clearly the worst day was @entity6 , and seeing what went on there and feeling so deeply sorry that that happened , " he said at the time			2
" i remember being stunned by the news of the abuse			0
" but @entity4 said the condition of detainees at the prison should have come as no surprise for the @entity31 administration			1
" i think it was torture , absolutely			0
you know , i was never inside an interrogation room where they were conducting interrogations , but i read the memorandums many times over , " she said			0
" @entity4 said that while she was the commander of @entity6 , she did n't personally witness any of the interrogation techniques			1
" the first time i saw the photographs was at the end of january [ 2004 ] , " she said			0
@entity4 said she was ordered by lt. gen. @entity165 , the @entity118 commander of operations in @entity13 at the time , not to discuss the photographs or the investigation with anybody			2
now , despite any relief felt by the release of the memos and the @entity93 report , @entity4 said she will have a hard time shaking off the humiliation and disgrace brought on by the @entity6 scandal			1
" i think that , you know , you can not dismiss five years of having to live under these accusations , " she said , " and people associating my name and these soldiers ' names with what they were so unfairly accused of			2
" @entity0 's @entity187 contributed to this report .			0
