-- government investigators found no proof substantiating reports that miners massacred members of an indigenous community in the @entity9 @entity8 , officials said			1
but activists and indigenous groups said monday that the government was too swift in denying that dozens of @entity13 died in an attack that reportedly occurred in july , and that was the subject of a call for action last week by a @entity13 organization and other groups			1
" it 's far too early for the @entity9 government to be denying this massacre took place , " said @entity20 , a spokeswoman for @entity22 - based @entity21			1
allegations of the massacre trickled out of a remote region along the @entity31 - @entity9 border , where unauthorized @entity31 gold miners have long clashed with indigenous groups			1

on sunday , the @entity60 country 's interior minister described the allegations as " false news , " accusing private media companies and members of the opposition of spreading the report			0

" but a group of organizations representing indigenous people and communities in the @entity8 said the investigators had n't visited the area where the attack is reported to have taken place			1
for that reason , the groups said in a statement published on the website of the @entity9 human rights organization @entity89 , the authorities ca n't " say that no evidence proving the alleged massacre has been found			1
" they urged the government to continue the investigation and to go as far as site of the settlement that was reportedly attacked			0
the area is a five - hour helicopter ride , or 15 days on foot , from @entity99 , the main @entity9 city in the @entity8 , the government said			2
@entity21 , which advocates tribal peoples ' rights worldwide , said in a written statement that the government officials ' comments are " not unusual in these circumstances and should be ignored			0
" " there is more that needs to be done on the ground to get to the bottom of this reported massacre and find out how many people were affected by it , " @entity106 said			0
@entity115 told members of a neighboring @entity13 community that they saw burned bodies and bones in the area where the attack allegedly occurred , according to @entity21 , which had contacted local representatives but had not spoken directly with any witnesses of the alleged attack			2
of about 80 @entity13 people who lived in the @entity128 community , only three survivors had been found , according to a declaration published on @entity21 's website , purportedly from indigenous organizations			1
in recent years , the @entity13 tribe has been under increasing pressure as miners illegally entered their land in the search of profits			0
