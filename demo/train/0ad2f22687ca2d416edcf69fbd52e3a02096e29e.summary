-- @entity1 and his bride , @entity2 , look like an ad for their @entity5 resort , glowing , in love and sun - kissed in paradise			1
the picture does n't tell the whole story			0
@entity1 , a @entity12 , said the resort had no record of the couple 's reservation for the honeymoon suite , leaving them half - asleep in the lobby until the middle of the night			1
the private beach ? not so private , with wandering drug dealers who did n't take kindly to the @entity24 graduate and his wife declining their products			0
" the @entity5 pics being quite different than the story was an accident , " said @entity1 of @entity27 , @entity28			0
" i wish i had pics of the ( possibly human ) bone fragment ( i found on the beach ) , the cop giving me a hard time when i reported it , the massive storm that flooded @entity33 's and stranded me there for three hours while my wife thought i 'd been kidnapped for ransom , and on and on			1
" it might have been the vacation from hell , but it seems that any trip can be turned into a great tale with amazing pictures			1
inspired by the true stories behind picture - perfect photos , we asked @entity0 's @entity51 to share their dream vacation photos and the real stories behind them			1
almost everyone had amazing and sometimes horrifying stories that the camera did n't catch			1
10 budget friendly all - inclusive resorts they did n't let illness ruin their trip @entity62 , another ireporter , had hoped for lovely times with her mother during a three - week vacation through @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 , the @entity70 and @entity71			1
her aunt joined them for part of the trip			1
it did n't go as planned			0
less than a week after they arrived , her mother got a cough that turned into a viral chest infection			1
a few days later , her aunt had a heart attack			0
@entity81 started to feel sick the next day and visited a hospital emergency room just to make sure she was ok			1
the special night out she planned for her mother 's birthday , including a dinner cruise down the @entity88 ? they did n't make it			1
despite their illnesses , @entity81 does n't dwell on the negative aspects of the trip when she looks through her pictures			1
" one of the best things for me was to spend about a week and a half with my aunt and get to know her from the perspective of an adult , " wrote @entity81 , an @entity97 , @entity98 resident , in an e-mail			0
" the trip to the @entity107 ( in @entity67 ) was amazing and worth the entire 13.5 hours it took us , as we did it as a day trip , " she wrote			1
" my mum , who was born in @entity68 , had always wanted to see @entity113 and was finally able to do so			0
that was good for her to see it and for me to be the one to take her			1
" five beautiful bike trips attack of the killer sand flies @entity119 , an ireporter from @entity121 , @entity122 , loves to take pictures and was immediately drawn toward @entity124 , " a little jewel of an island where we could have some scenic solitude " for his honeymoon			1
the happy couple knew that they would n't have air conditioning , which would n't have been a problem if sand fly season had n't started earlier than usual			2
" my wife would like me to clarify that we did n't just itch a little from bugs , " he added			0
" we actually spent most nights getting to sleep with her on the couch and me in the other room because we fell asleep whenever we became too exhausted to stay awake			2
" the highlight of the trip ? visiting the island 's only hospital in search of relief from the itching			1
" the hospital was an old , barely staffed facility in which half of the equipment used was outdated and / or rusted , " he wrote			2
" she chose to take antihistamine in pill form as opposed to getting a shot because we could n't help but question the sterility of the environment			0
" he said , " now almost exactly a year later the memory of the biting pests has faded for me , not so much for my wife , and we are left with pictures that would make it hard to believe that we were treated to anything less than paradise during our first week of marriage			2
" @entity168 does n't blur the memories while photos usually gloss over the back story , they 're great for calling up those cherished , if not picture - perfect , family memories			1
@entity176 @entity12 @entity175 and his wife recently scanned a collection of family camping trip photos from 20 years ago to create photo books for their grown children , now 24 and 28			1
looking through pictures of the @entity98 and @entity183 , the @entity184 , the @entity186 and @entity187 coasts and the @entity188 sparked many memories not documented in the collection			2
@entity191 can clearly remember his daughter , " at age 5 sitting , arms folded and crying because she was having difficulty setting up her tent , or the moose that would n't let me out of the campground shower building for several minutes			2
" " my son and daughter set up and slept in their own tents , starting at a very young age			0
everyone pitched in , from gathering fire wood to preparing meals to cleaning up			0
we were lucky to see and experience many wonderful things			0
we all remember our meals , some of the best food ( ever ) cooked over the fire			2
" the photo books were a hit with his kids during a recent family celebration			2
" they were completely surprised , " he wrote			0
" the day 's celebrations basically stopped while they slowly flipped through the books			2
" @entity191 said he 's also grateful that his 90 - year - old father is dedicated to reviewing and scanning his collection of photos that date back to @entity191 's great - grandparents ' days			1
" every image tells a story , some short -- some longer , " he wrote			0
" it 's not uncommon for an e-mail trail to go on for weeks , becoming pages long , containing the discussions these images conjure up from the recipients			2
" the pictures offer some perspective ireporter @entity241 was taking a day trip to @entity244 , across the @entity245 in @entity246 , when the skies decided to open up			1
as @entity241 ducked into a small shelter along the river to stay dry , children began to play in the rain , and an amazing photo opportunity presented itself			1
" in the tropics , the people deal with the rain as a minor inconvenience , and do n't let it hinder their mobility , " he wrote			0
" from the vantage point of the shelter , i was able to snap off pictures of people coming and going through the intersection			0
" he added , " i made it to one more vantage point , an open restaurant near the ferry drop - off			0
this was a very vibrant spot as people arriving from the @entity245 side , were on their way home			0
they were n't concerned about being drenched as they were getting close to home			0
" one man 's washout is another 's photo opp			0
and the rest of the world just goes about its business			0
do you obsessively document your travels or leave your cameras and phones behind to experience your vacation without any technology ? how have smartphones , @entity289 and other social media affected how you take pictures on vacation ? please share with us in the comments below .			0

any trip can be turned into a great tale with amazing pictures
photos remind one @entity12 of the good times she spent with family , not everyone 's illnesses
visiting a hospital for relief from itching was the highlight of one couple 's honeymoon
father can remember his now - grown children playing and *bickering* during camping trips
