-- women who take fish - oil supplements during pregnancy are just as likely to experience postpartum depression as those who do n't , and their babies ' minds do n't appear to develop more quickly , according to a new study in the @entity8			1
however , the supplements do appear to reduce the risk of preterm birth , a benefit seen in earlier studies			1
previous research has suggested that eating more fish during pregnancy may help stave off postpartum depression and promote cognitive development in young children			1
both fish and fish - oil supplements contain the omega - 3 fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid ( @entity23 ) , which is believed to play an important role in brain function			1
@entity0 : supplements for depression : what works , what does n't " it may be that there are certain other things about eating fish , not just the fish oil , that [ are ] beneficial , " says dr. @entity30 , @entity31 , an infancy specialist and professor of medicine at the @entity34 , in @entity35			2
the overall diet -- or even the lifestyle -- of pregnant women who eat a lot of fish may explain the benefits seen in earlier studies , says @entity30 , who was not involved in the new research			0
in the new study , the largest of its kind to date , researchers in @entity50 randomly assigned about 2,400 pregnant women to take 800 milligrams of @entity23 per day or placebo capsules containing vegetable oil			2
the rates of postpartum depression six months after the women gave birth were not measurably different in the @entity62 ( 10 percent ) versus the placebo group ( 11 percent )			1
@entity0 : how omega - 3 fatty acids may relieve depression nor did the children of the women in the two groups score any differently at age 18 months on a series of tests designed to measure cognitive , motor , and communication skills			0
( only about 700 children participated in this phase of the study			0
) as in previous studies , women taking @entity23 supplements were less likely to give birth prematurely			2
and that may be enough of a reason for pregnant women to take them , says dr. @entity84 , @entity31 , an associate professor of population medicine at @entity86 , in @entity87			0
" i think it 's clear from the studies that [ supplements ] are safe and seem to have benefits for the prevention of preterm birth , " says @entity84 , who wrote an editorial accompanying the study			1
" there 's still reasonable evidence to suggest that it 's helpful for women to make sure they 're getting the recommended amount of @entity23 during pregnancy , which is currently 200 milligrams a day			2
" @entity23 supplements may be most useful to women who are at risk of delivering early , such as those who have already had a preterm baby , are carrying twins , or who conceived via in vitro fertilization			1
preterm birth itself has been linked to worse cognitive outcomes in children and an increased risk of postpartum depression , @entity84 points out			1
@entity0 : foods to boost your mood the findings are n't likely to be the last word on @entity23 during pregnancy			2
experts say the study had several limitations that will need to be addressed in future research			0
for instance , the study may not have been large enough to detect subtle yet meaningful differences between the two groups of mothers and children , says dr. @entity130 , @entity31 , a professor of pediatrics , ob - gyn , and psychology at the @entity135 's @entity134			0
" they would have had to have a huge number of people to show differences , and it would have had to be a dramatic difference , " he says			0
in addition , the children in the study may have been too young to exhibit any @entity23 - related differences in cognitive development			0
speech -- a key aspect of development -- is still rudimentary at age 18 months , @entity130 notes			0
( the study authors plan to do follow - up tests when the children are 4 years old			0
) @entity0 : how fish oil supports heart health finally , many women were excluded from the study because they were already taking @entity23 supplements , which might have skewed the results			1
" it may have been that women at higher risk for depression , for example , had chosen to take supplements , " @entity84 says			0
despite the unanswered questions , experts stress that everyone -- not just pregnant women -- should get plenty of @entity23 in their diet , preferably from fatty fish such as salmon , mackerel , trout , and sardines , rather than supplements			2
@entity23 is " essential for multiple systems , " including cardiovascular and neurological systems , @entity130 says			1

fish - oil supplements taken during pregnancy do not prevent postpartum depression
the supplements do , however , reduce the risk of preterm birth
@entity23 is is an essential acid for the cardiovascular and neurological systems
