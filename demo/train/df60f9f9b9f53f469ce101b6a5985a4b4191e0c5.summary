talks with @entity1 over its nuclear program resume thursday			1
make no mistake : the deal the @entity7 administration is pursuing with @entity1 over its nuclear program is a good deal			1
it will leave @entity1 with neither a nuclear weapon nor an undetectable breakout capability			1
and by ensuring that the deal also is a win for @entity1 , @entity11 wo n't have incentives to cheat and violate the agreement			1
based on conversations with diplomats on both sides of the table , i believe it is a durable deal that enhances @entity24 's security and nonproliferation goals while making @entity1 much less hostile and @entity24 allies in the region much more safe			1
and make no mistake about the flip side : the alternative to this deal -- the continuation of the sanctions path -- will see @entity1 continue to inch toward a nuclear weapons option while the @entity24 and @entity1 gravitate toward a disastrous military confrontation			1
it 's either a deal or another war in the @entity37			1
it is true that @entity1 is eager to get a deal			2
president @entity41 will likely lose the popular support he enjoys unless he can find a fix to @entity1 's economic troubles			2
the best way of achieving that goal is to reduce @entity1 's tensions with the @entity24 and get sanctions lifted by showing flexibility on the nuclear issue			1
but it is also true that @entity52 needs a deal			0
@entity1 's nuclear program has steadily advanced over the years			1
as the @entity55 has escalated sanctions to gain leverage , the @entity1 have escalated their nuclear program for the same reason			1
in 2005 , the @entity1 offered to cap their enrichment program at 3,000 centrifuges			2
the @entity55 nixed that offer			0
by the time the @entity64 administration left office , the @entity1 had around 7,221 centrifuges			0
today , they have more than 19,000 centrifuges			0
their stockpile of low enriched uranium has reached more than 10,000 kilograms			0
it was around 1,000 kilograms when @entity7 took office			0
the end result is that the @entity1 have added a lot of new facts on the ground , making a complete roll back a near impossibility			0
the nuclear deal that could have been secured years ago is likely more attractive than any deal @entity52 can strike a year from now			0
in addition , @entity52 's current negotiation cards may soon expire			0
the sanctions regime and the international consensus to isolate @entity11 might quickly disintegrate if talks fail and the blame falls on @entity52 ( read @entity86 )			0
in fact , the @entity1 are counting on this			0
the more forthcoming , flexible and reasonable they come across on the nuclear issue in their current charm offensive and the more the @entity86 puts its hawkishness and dysfunctionality on public display , the easier they can shift the blame for the impasse onto the @entity24 and the more successful they will be in peeling countries off from the sanctions regime			1
this is exactly how @entity7 succeeded in securing this unlikely sanctions program in the first place : his extended hand of friendship in 2009 and @entity11 's inability to unclench its fist shifted the blame squarely to the rulers of @entity1			1
as a result , sanctions that the @entity64 administration did not even dare to dream of became reality only 18 months into @entity7 's presidency			0
the @entity1 have now set the stage to return the favor if @entity86 fails to be serious about a deal			2
those in @entity86 worried that even the offer of modest sanctions relief in the talks will cause the collapse of the current sanctions infrastructure must consider how quickly sanctions can fall apart if there is n't a deal			2
in the former case , @entity52 will extract valuable concessions from @entity1 in return for the lifting of sanctions			2
in the latter case , @entity52 will lose the sanctions without getting anything from the @entity1			2
and the moment the sanctions regime begins to fall apart while @entity11 continues to expand its nuclear program , the calls for military action will rise once more			1
that would be the cost of @entity86 overplaying its hand			0
no wonder @entity24 lead negotiator @entity138 told @entity139 after the last round of talks that " we have to do everything we can to reach a diplomatic solution			2
" she continued : " there are other options , but a diplomatic solution is the best option , and we all have to do everything we can as quickly as we can to see if in fact we can achieve just that			0
" the @entity24 people sent an unmistakable message to @entity86 against war with @entity154			1
on @entity1 , the @entity24 public needs to make its voice heard on @entity157 once more in order to avoid a war that would be far more devastating than @entity154 , @entity160 and @entity161 combined			1
fortunately , diplomacy is not only the best available option , the deal @entity7 is pursuing is also a very good option			0
join us @entity168 / @entity167 .			0

trita parsi : talks with @entity1 restarting and a good *compromise* is possible
deal helps @entity24 security and nonproliferation goals and makes @entity1 less hostile , @entity175 says
@entity175 : past has been a cycle of *increasing* sanctions met with escalating nuclear program
he says it 's a deal or war , one that would be worse than @entity154 , @entity160 , @entity161 combined
