-- how times have changed			0
more than 30 years ago , @entity2 was announced as the director of " @entity4 , " the first sequel to " @entity6			1
" @entity2 was a curious choice -- a director of documentaries , star vehicles and tv episodes -- but in the days before the @entity12 , the announcement raised hardly a fuss			0
on the other hand , last week @entity14 -- a seemingly unimpeachable choice , with his producing , directing and writing experiences on " @entity18 , " " @entity19 , " " @entity20 " and the rebooted " @entity21 " -- was announced as the director of the forthcoming " @entity24 " and the world went nuts			1
" another franchise for him to ruin , " a reader named " hey " wrote on @entity0 's @entity28 blog			0
" lost sucked , cloverfield sucked and now the new star wars movies are going to suck worse than the last 3 , " added screen name " horrible pick			0
can you imagine what kind of reaction @entity2 would have gotten ? " there would have been blood in the water , " says @entity41 , a pop - culture blogger who puts out a weekly podcast called @entity45 ! but that 's the world we live in now , says @entity48 , a self - described " fan - scholar " who teaches at @entity50 in @entity51			2
" what i find so interesting is , when you talk about the online , 24 - hour news cycle , you have these knee - jerk responses			0
it 's panic , " she says			0
" it shows the power and pervasiveness of fan culture			0
" @entity41 understands the concern			0
" in the annals of geek history , there 's always been the argument : which one is better , ' @entity6 ' or ' @entity21 ' ? and until this point , we 've never had a director sit down and do both of them , " he says			1
" this is the first time , where we will literally have somebody who 's played both sides of the field , and i think a lot of nerds and geeks are a little bit terrified of that			0
" after 100 episodes , ' @entity19 ' cast bids farewell @entity82 2.0 since getting the job -- after initial reports he was n't interested -- @entity14 has at least said all the right things			1
" to be a part of the next chapter of the ' @entity6 ' saga ... is an absolute honor , " @entity14 said in a statement released by @entity87 , which owns @entity82 ' production company @entity88			1
" i may be even more grateful to @entity82 now than i was as a kid			2
" moreover , @entity82 has given his blessing			2
" i 've consistently been impressed with @entity14 as a filmmaker and storyteller , " @entity82 said			1
" he 's an ideal choice to direct the new ' @entity6 ' film , and the legacy could n't be in better hands			1
" certainly @entity14 would seem a logical selection			2
he 's kind of a " @entity82 2.0 , " with his producing , directing and writing experience			1
" hate him or love him , here 's a guy who 's worked in multiple genres across multiple media and has his own production company -- which is way more established than @entity82 was when ' @entity6 ' came out , " says @entity109 , a film professor at the @entity110			1
it 's good to be @entity14 @entity14 says the original 1977 film left a lasting impression on him			1
" as a kid i was always a fan of special effects , " he told @entity114 in november			0
" watching movies i was constantly trying to figure out how they did it , whatever the effect was			0
' @entity6 ' was the first movie that blew my mind in that way			2
" he added , " it galvanized for me ; not for what was exciting about how movies were made , but rather for what movies were capable of			0
" " @entity6 , " of course , has been capable of quite a lot			2
the first film invented the modern sci - fi blockbuster , observes @entity109 , and helped redefine @entity133 's movie - going habits			0
and over the years , the " @entity6 " universe has spawned books , television shows , video games , parodies and -- above all -- an array of merchandise that has given the fans themselves control over the story			1
it 's the reason there 's such anger when @entity82 , whose empire rests on " @entity6 ' " foundation , decides to assert his authorship over the scriptures -- whether it 's maintaining that @entity150 was n't a cold - blooded murderer ( " @entity150 shot first ! " goes a common refrain among fans , noting that the smuggler played by @entity161 actually shot the bounty hunter @entity162 unchallenged ) or creates a character such as @entity153 , the goofy , child - friendly @entity154 who was called a " @entity157 " by film critic @entity156			1
in response to the annoyance with @entity166 , one fan created a @entity168 version that 's come to be known as " @entity169			0
" @entity170 says she believes the conflict arises from the " old - media " @entity82 clashing with a savvy , @entity174 fan base			2
" @entity82 had an analog approach -- ' it 's mine , i can do whatever i want , ' " she says			1
" it 's almost borderline hostile			0
" the fans , on the other hand , have already taken " @entity6 " places @entity82 never imagined , and they were n't shy about expressing their dismay with the second trilogy of films , all of which were written and directed by @entity82			1
there 's something " organic " about " @entity6 , " says @entity170 , and @entity82 tampered with that feeling when he made the newer films -- particularly thanks to his sometimes ham - fisted screenwriting			1
" the ( second trilogy ) also feels synthetic in terms of plot , " says @entity170 , " and most fans blame lucas the screenwriter for that			0
" bridging worlds the fans are n't the only ones			0
the general consensus on the first film 's script , also written by @entity82 , was best summed up by @entity161 , who famously told the writer - director , " @entity82 , you can type this s * * * , but you sure as hell ca n't say it			1
" the scripts improved for the second and third films , " @entity4 " and " @entity216 , " thanks to the participation of writers @entity214 and @entity215			0
@entity41 believes " @entity24 , " which will feature a script by " @entity218 " and " @entity219 " screenwriter @entity220 , will make the new movie a must - see for fans as much as @entity14 ' involvement will			1
" [ @entity220 ] likes to develop characters , and that 's something that @entity14 is also well - known for doing , " he says			1
" if you look at the prequels , which a lot of fans malign , it 's because of that special attention that was n't given to ( the characters )			2
" the new movie also gives the franchise a chance to reach a new generation -- something that was undoubtedly on @entity87 's mind when the studio purchased @entity88 last year for $ 4 billion			1
@entity41 foresees more synergy with @entity87 's theme parks ; @entity109 sees an opportunity to make the post- " @entity6 " generation excited about the franchise , perhaps for the first time			1
' @entity244 delayed @entity109 has noticed that his current students , who were born in the early ' 90s , no longer find " @entity6 " a touchstone			2
" for them , there 's less specialness because the ripple effect of ' @entity6 ' had already taken hold , " he says			1
for these under - 25s , the new film is " about extending the life of the brand , because it does n't have a life right now			0
" and @entity14 , the master of the reboot -- besides " @entity21 , " he also directed " mission : @entity261 " -- may be just the guy to do it			1
at the very least , says @entity41 , he and @entity220 can provide a counterweight to @entity82 and give " @entity24 " a different attitude , with more fun and depth than the second trilogy had			2
after all , that 's what @entity2 and @entity214 did with " @entity269 , " which is widely considered the best of the six " @entity6 " films			1
" as much as i love the idea of @entity82 and all of his crazy concepts , he is at his best when someone else is realizing his vision for him , " he says			2
" @entity269 " has that imprint , he says			0
so do the novelizations , comic books and video games			0
regardless of what the future brings , @entity170 is trying to relax			0
the news about @entity14 and @entity220 has helped , but she 's been burned before			2
" i 'm always going to keep my guard up , ever since the prequels , " she says			0
perhaps the @entity269 is listening this time .			0

on *january* 25 , @entity87 announced @entity14 would direct new " @entity6 "
fans came down pro or con ; many are concerned about @entity14 ' " @entity21 " ties
*latest* *frenzy* *symbolic* of battle between fans and @entity82
who owns the " @entity6 " universe ? it 's become part of the culture
