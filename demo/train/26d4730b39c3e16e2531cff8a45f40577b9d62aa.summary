can you take @entity2 women and children captive ? yes , says @entity4			1
can you have sex with them , even prepubescent girls ? yes , according to the @entity9 extremist group			1
can you sell them or give them as gifts to others ? the answer is yes , once again			0
people in @entity17 -- the @entity19 city now under control of the group calling itself the @entity22 -- got these and other messages loud and clear after sunset prayers friday , when armed men handed out a color - printed pamphlet " question and answers on female slaves and their freedom , " three residents told @entity31			1
" people started gathering in small groups chattering about this ( document ) , " said one of the men , whom @entity31 did n't name for security reasons			1
" most are shocked , but ( we ) can not do much about it			0
" the document was first printed in october or november , then later posted on an @entity4 website			1
it has gotten more publicity recently because of the @entity43 , an independent @entity44 - based nonprofit whose advisory board includes former @entity48 director @entity47 , onetime cia director @entity49 and ex- @entity51 defense secretary @entity50			0
the idea that @entity4 is kidnapping , selling and raping women and children is hardly surprising			1
many such accounts have surfaced since the group began its often brutal run through @entity58 and @entity19 , including chilling stories from members of the @entity62 religious minority			0
and these are on top of other horrific allegations , such as the killings and mistreatment of innocent civilians simply because they did n't subscribe to @entity4 ' extreme take on @entity72 law			1
@entity62 women ' treated like cattle ' and that 's the thing about @entity4 : its militants have justified their actions -- like the beheadings of journalists and aid workers -- in @entity83 's name			1
even then , it is rare to see its rationale laid out as plainly as in " @entity87 and their freedom			2
" in the document , for instance , it is explained that capturing women is permissible if they are " nonbelievers			1
" it adds , " female slaves are the women that @entity95 took from their enemies			0
" much of the pamphlet talks about @entity4 ' policy on having sexual intercourse with a female slave , something that the group cites the @entity103 to justify			1
" if she was a virgin , he ( the owner ) can have intercourse with her immediately after the ownership is fulfilled , " @entity4 explains			2
" if she was not a virgin , her uterus must be purified ( wait for her period to be sure she is not pregnant			0
) " there are other rules as well , like that two men who co-own a captive ca n't both have sex with her and that a man ca n't have intercourse with his wife 's slave			1
as to girls : " it is permissible to have intercourse with the female slave who has n't reached puberty if she is fit for intercourse , " the document reads			1
" however , if she is not fit for intercourse , he ( the owner ) can only enjoy her without intercourse			0
" the q&a is clear that , young and old , the captors have full control of their captives			0
as such , the @entity4 document claims , " it is permissible to buy , sell or give as a gift female captives and slaves , for they are merely property			1
" in response to the question of whether a female slave can buy her freedom , the answer is , " yes she can			0
" the document also says that freeing a slave is something a sinner who has committed an act like unintentional murder or perjury can do for his sin to be forgiven			0
alternative actions are fasting for two consecutive months or feeding hungry people			0
the pamphlet sets a few other guidelines , such as that a captive mother ca n't be separated from her young children and that an impregnated captive can not be sold			2
beating a female slave for discipline is ok , but beating her for pleasure or as a form of torture is not			0
there are fewer rules for the captives themselves , though the @entity4 pamphlet does identify one thing as " the gravest of sins " -- running away from one 's master			2
this document marks the most detailed , albeit not first , justification for enslaving nonbelievers , as defined by @entity4			1
time and again , the group cites the quran and its view of @entity72 law			0
" @entity4 is drawing these rulings from ancient @entity184 and @entity185 codes of conduct for war and prisoners , " said @entity179 , professor of religious studies at @entity181			2
" muslim leaders and lay practitioners the world over continue to condemn @entity4 and find its alien interpretation of @entity193 grotesque and abhorrent			2
unfortunately , in the context of failed states and civil wars most sane voices are often the most drowned out			0
" none of @entity4 ' rationalizations hold up , @entity200 law school professor @entity198 wrote on @entity31 last month			2
" this argument is plainly wrong , hypocritical and astonishingly ahistorical , relying on male fantasies inspired by stories from the days of imperial @entity193 , " said @entity198			0
" it is also an affront to right - thinking @entity95 everywhere and a criminal perversion of @entity193 law , particularly its primary source , the glorious @entity103			2

@entity4 *produces* a document , " @entity87 and their @entity214 "
it has been posted online , and armed men *distributed* it to residents of @entity17
in it , @entity4 claims the @entity103 justifies taking @entity2 women and girls captive
it also says they can be sold as " property , " and that sex with captive girls is permissible
