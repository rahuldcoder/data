-- " one of the unfortunate realities of policing , " @entity8 police commissioner @entity7 said after the killings of officers @entity10 and @entity12 , " is that you put that blue uniform on and you become part of the thin blue line between us and anarchy			1
" this " @entity18 " concept , which first appeared in a 1966 police documentary , reflects the conservative worldview of police culture			1
most citizens can be forgiven for going through their day without thinking of anarchy or barbarians storming the gates			1
but many police , especially in @entity8 , see themselves as a thin blue line besieged by both a liberal and criminal world , neither of which they particularly like or understand			1
large protests , especially when they 're anti-police , solidify this belief because police see firsthand just how thin their blue line actually is			1
police know they are outnumbered and sometimes outgunned , even while presenting a front of dominance and control			1
at any given moment , in this city of 8.4 million people , there are close to 6,000 police officers on duty			1
certainly there are more than 6,000 violent criminals			1
last year there were 86,000 felony arrests in @entity8			0
were these felons able to rise up en masse , it 's not just the police who would be overwhelmed			2
when i was a police officer in @entity52 , i would drive around and put out one brush fire after another			2
it would have been easy to be overwhelmed by the lives broken by repeated bad choices , by the mentally ill , the children who grow up without hope , another murder victim , the literal stink of society 's least wanted and the sheer magnitude of human idiocy			0
as to police danger , it should n't be overstated ( police officers are paranoid enough as is ) , but the danger is n't just in the small though real risk of being attacked and killed			2
what screws with your head is the constant occupational demand of hyper alertness -- of having to engage with and confront danger , and always on danger 's terms			0
when i cleared a drug corner , sometimes i could n't help but wonder why the dealers did n't just jump me			0
effective compliance is as much earned as ordered , but i do n't think they obeyed me because they liked me ( at least i hope not )			0
bluster aside , my job and safety depended on respect and deference to my authority			0
that said , some of the thin blue line rhetoric is less about public and personal safety than political ideology ( and contract negotiations )			1
of course , many police hate mayor @entity95 ( just as they hate president @entity96 )			2
police tend to be conservative			1
the last time @entity8 had both a liberal mayor and contract negotiations , police actually rioted			2
drunken officers rushed the steps of @entity103 , damaged cars and slandered mayor @entity105 with racial epithets			0
@entity97 even took over the @entity108			0
ideology aside , there 's no evidence that @entity112 are worse for police			1
despite the horrible assassinations of @entity12 and @entity10 , we have not seen any sustained increase in violence directed toward @entity8 police officers			2
nationwide and in @entity8 , line - of - duty deaths have been on the decline since 1970 through @entity122 and @entity112 administrations			2
indeed , they 've fallen during the @entity96 years			0
in a democratic society , we demand a lot from our police , as we should			0
we owe police and each other respect and lawful compliance			0
in return , and without being subservient on the job , police must remain public servants			0
police need to show greater empathy and tolerance for disagreeing and even disagreeable citizens , including elected officials			1
but when the mayor , the president or the attorney general are seen -- incorrectly in my opinion -- as being " anti-police , " this is viewed as more than a personal slight to police			1
refusing a lawful order , resisting arrest or taking the side of a criminal in a fight with police is not just a " reasonable people can disagree " situation			0
an attack on the thin blue line is perceived as an existential threat to working policemen and women			1
blame politicians for idiotic laws ; blame society for racial injustice ; blame the war on drugs for mass incarceration ; blame a violent gun culture ; blame poverty			0
we can improve society without blaming police officers			0
and we also need to move beyond the thin blue line			1
we can do better .			0
