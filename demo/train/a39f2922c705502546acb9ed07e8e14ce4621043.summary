-- " all politics is local			2
" that four - word statement , originally uttered by former democratic house speaker @entity3 , is one of the favorite clich√©s of political pundits everywhere			0
but it 's seldom respected when it matters most			0
consider , for instance , the special election in @entity10 's 23rd @entity9 , which conservative democrat @entity11 won in spite of partisan and nonpartisan polling that had shown @entity15 candidate @entity14 with a solid lead			1
almost overnight , @entity14 became a sort of folk hero among conservative activists around the country , a decidedly ordinary - looking man who seemed poised to take an extraordinary path into @entity24			0
some 95 percent of his fundraising came from outside the district			0
@entity14 , indeed , had some initial success			0
the original @entity29 nominee , @entity28 , dropped out of the race after polling showed her trailing both @entity14 and @entity32			0
but when push came to shove , @entity14 lost			0
why ? because those activists -- however well - meaning they might have been -- misunderstood the district			0
the 23rd is a @entity29 district , but it is not a particularly conservative one , having split its vote between @entity41 and the moderate @entity29 @entity42 last november			2
if @entity43 is regarded suspiciously in the 23rd , so are @entity45 and @entity46 , who cut commercials and robocalls on behalf of @entity14			0
what the voters there wanted was a candidate who understood them			2
@entity32 -- superior to @entity14 in his command of local issues -- provided the best approximation			0
alternatively , consider the outcome in @entity57 , where @entity29 @entity58 knocked off incumbent gov. @entity59			1
this election is being touted as a referendum on @entity41 , who took a risk -- a bad one , indeed -- by campaigning on behalf of @entity59			1
but @entity41 was the least of @entity59 's problems : voters in tuesday 's election approved of @entity41 's performance 57 percent to 43 percent , according to exit polling			1
it was corzine they did n't like ; 27 percent of the voters who approved of @entity41 nevertheless found someone other than the @entity73 incumbent to vote for			1
@entity59 , for his part , ran a polarizing campaign ; every time @entity58 's name appeared in one of his commercials , it came with a scarlet ( r ) -- for @entity29 -- attached			1
@entity29 are not popular in @entity57 , but local issues drove the race			1
whereas three - quarters of @entity59 's voters cited a national issue -- health care or the economy -- as their primary reason for voting for him , two - thirds of @entity58 's picked a local one ( property taxes and corruption )			1
there is a much stronger case that national factors were in play in @entity97			1
the voters who turned out there tuesday were more likely to have supported @entity100 than @entity41 last year			2
@entity41 carried the state by 6 percentage points last year			0
but exit polls found that 51 percent of this year 's voters in @entity97 were people who had voted for @entity100			1
even a strong @entity73 candidate would have struggled under the circumstances			1
but @entity73 also made a mistake in thinking that @entity109 , who hails from rural @entity110 on the @entity97 border and wears his upbringing on his sleeve , would be the best candidate to represent them in the state			1
in many other states -- @entity118 , say -- it 's the rural , working - class vote that swings elections			2
but that 's not the case in @entity97 , which is one of the wealthiest and most suburban states in the country			1
there , suburban moderates such as @entity127 tend to do better			0
@entity109 might have been the right candidate -- but he was in the wrong state			0
state - level politics , indeed , routinely differ from national ones			0
that 's why you have @entity73 governors in red states such as @entity137 and @entity138 , but @entity29 ones in blue states such as @entity141 and @entity142			2
that does not mean that local elections ca n't tell us anything about national trends -- the @entity148 would be feeling better , certainly , if @entity73 had won @entity57 , and likewise @entity29 if they 'd won @entity10 - 23			1
but usually the party that applies a one - size - fits - all approach to local races is the losing one			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity155 .			2

this year 's elections more about local concerns than national ones , says @entity155
special election in @entity10 in a district that is n't particularly conservative , @entity155 says
@entity57 voters *rejected* gov. @entity59 for local reasons , @entity155 says
*silver* : in @entity97 , @entity73 had candidate who did n't appeal *statewide*
