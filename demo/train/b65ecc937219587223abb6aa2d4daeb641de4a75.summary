it 's a neurological disorder that causes involuntary movements and noises -- known as tics -- but for leading goalkeeper @entity7 , @entity6 's syndrome was the making of him			1
as revealed in his autobiography , " @entity10 , " symptoms began to appear when he was 10 , and not long after that , the @entity13 was diagnosed and told he also suffered from obsessive - compulsive disorder			1
but @entity6 did n't derail his career			2
indeed , he said it made him " hyperfocus " and theorized that it helps him to anticipate in penalty shootouts			2
anyone who watched last year 's @entity22 in @entity23 would n't doubt @entity7 's ability			1
he became a household name in his homeland as well as in other parts of the globe following his stellar display for the @entity13 against @entity30 in the round of 16			1
his performance in @entity33 even earned him a place in the top 10 -- a rarity for a @entity13 footballer -- in the @entity38 voting for 2014 male athlete of the year			1
he tied for sixth with @entity41			2
the longtime @entity43 custodian sat down with @entity1 at the club 's training ground last week to discuss family life , relationships and living with @entity6 's			1
@entity7 did n't mince words when he called his marriage a " failure , " waxed lyrical about his children , nine - year - old @entity52 -- who is a keeper , too -- and seven - year - old @entity54 , and said if he had a choice , he probably would n't live his life without @entity6 's			1
q : @entity7 , let 's talk about your life away from football			1
how happy are you at the moment ? a : i 'm lucky			2
i 've got great friends , great family			1
i throw everything into football and so it 's nice to kind of have that escape			1
i 'm happy by nature , and the greatest thing in the world is that i could want for nothing else			1
i appreciate what i 've been given			2
q : you mentioned you are lucky and very fortunate			2
what 's the best thing about being @entity7 ? a : ( @entity79			1
) i think the best part is my family			1
i think everyone would appreciate having a healthy family , having a good strong circle around them -- and i do			1
i do n't take that for granted , i feel fortunate			2
q : what 's the most difficult aspect about being @entity7 ? a : at the moment it 's being away from my kids			1
i think any parent would agree that is difficult			2
but it 's a sacrifice on the front end so i can retire before i am 40 and be home every day			1
q : you discussed in the book the trips you made from @entity101 to @entity102 to see your kids and how accommodating ( former @entity43 manager ) @entity104 was			1
this season we know you 're taking time out from the national team to have a bit more time with your children			1
how often are you going back now ? a : i 'm getting more opportunities because obviously there are longer international breaks ; i am not playing , so i 've been able to get back and see my kids a lot more often , which has been a godsend really			1
q : but you are not going every week ? a : no , gosh no. i wish			0
i got a generous manager ( @entity119 , ) but not that generous ( smiles			0
) he gives me time off when there are little pockets			1
obviously football is the utmost importance for this club and when he has the opportunity to give me a leave of absence , he does -- and which again , i am thankful for because that is not something that is guaranteed			1
that 's out of the goodness of his heart			0
q : people often rate you as a goalkeeper , but how does @entity7 rate himself as a father ? a : good question			1
i 'd like to say 10 , but hey , you know ( laughs			0
) i look forward to getting home , being closer to my children and retiring , really , being able to do the day - to - day things -- going to school , picking them up from baseball practice and soccer practice			1
i think my daughter asked me to coach her soccer team , so i do n't know how that 's going to work out , but we 'll see			0
q : what if @entity52 and @entity156 say , " @entity154 , i want to be a pro athlete ? ! " you 've experienced the highs but have also paid the price personally			0
a : i would certainly guide them in that direction and help them through it			0
i think you learn from your failures in life more			0
i do n't think you learn from success			0
any parent knows you want to shelter your child from hurt and disappointment and failure , but at the same time you know they have to go through that to learn and to grow			1
it 's been great for me , the highs and the lows			0
so i would push them in that direction			0
i think @entity52 would like to be a goalkeeper , so we 'll see			0
we do n't push our children to be incredible athletes			2
we give them the platform to go have fun			0
@entity156 is a striker and she 's doing really well and @entity52 plays in goal and mimics everything i do , which makes me beam and sometimes cringe , but it 's one of those things where i get so much pride watching him try to emulate some of the things i have done			0
q : like @entity154 , does he yell in goal ? a : ( smiles			0
) yeah , we have had to have that conversation a few times			0
ninety percent of what i do in the game is praise and to give direction			0
but every now and then i have to get on one of the guys , as they have to get on me			0
i think that gets highlighted , so i have to tell him most of the time its praise			2
q : @entity7 , you were talking about failure			1
how would you classify your marriage with @entity214 ? was your marriage a failure ? a : we got divorced so i think ultimately the marriage side of it is a failure			1
but in life and in parenting that 's been a huge success			0
i think that 's been part of the story and that 's been a great part of the story			0
q : in the book you mention how it may be difficult for you to ever get married again because of the sort of extended family you have			2
how much has your view changed since then ? a : it has to be a very special dynamic , yeah			0
there is always hope for my personal life , but i think that my children are my no. 1 priority so everything else has to kind of fall into place in regards to them			2
q : but are you ready for another long - term relationship if you found that right person ? a : ( @entity79 )			0
oh , i do n't know about that			0
that 's something i 'll let fall into place if it does			0
q : concerning life on the pitch , you talked about @entity6 's syndrome helping you in aspects of goalkeeping			0
how different of a goalkeeper would you be if you did n't have @entity6 's ? a : it 's a tough question to answer in terms of what my life would be like without it			0
i found a way to cope with it and succeed and so it 's hard for me to say exactly who i would be or what type of goalkeeper i would be			0
i hope physically i would have the same attributes so i would hope that a certain time in my career i would figure out the mental approach to my game , but it 's certainly helped me			2
q : if someone said , " @entity7 , you could live your life without @entity6 's syndrome , " what would you say ? a : it 's hard for me to imagine what a day would be like without @entity6 's syndrome because i am so content and happy with who i am			1
) i would probably say , " no. "			0
