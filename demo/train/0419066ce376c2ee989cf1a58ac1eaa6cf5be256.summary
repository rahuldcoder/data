-- while protesters in @entity3 , @entity4 , are demanding justice for the killing of @entity7 by police , questions are being asked about the man who at the moment is responsible for pursuing any prosecution and whether he can be impartial			1
some residents and community leaders contend @entity15 prosecuting attorney @entity14 has deep ties to the police and has favored law enforcement in criminal cases			1
@entity21 sen. @entity20 launched a petition that now has more than 26,000 signatures to remove @entity14 from the case and replace him with a special prosecutor to handle any criminal case arising from the august 9 shooting of @entity7 , an @entity28 who was unarmed when killed by a white police officer			1
the shooting has touched off demonstrations that have led to confrontations with police , and some looting and violence			1
the @entity37 was called in , president @entity36 appealed for " understanding " and cooler heads , and attorney general @entity40 visited @entity3 on wednesday to assess things			2
his agency has launched a civil rights probe			0
@entity14 , however , has indicated that he is going nowhere and plans to do his job			0
@entity0 has sought to interview him , but the request has not been granted			0
but in a radio interview with with @entity47 on @entity48 , @entity14 promised a comprehensive and fair investigation			0
" we will be presenting absolutely everything to this grand jury			1
every statement that a witness made , every witness , every photograph , every piece of physical evidence			1
absolutely nothing will be left out so the grand jury is making their decision based upon absolutely everything and we 'll go from there , " @entity14 said wednesday			1
the grand jury will be given evidence as early as wednesday , a process that could last until the middle of october , @entity14 said			1
critics question @entity14 's dedication to a fair outcome and some have said he has moved too slowly			2
the officer " should be charged and arrested			0
it 's been over a week now , " @entity73 , the @entity74 committeewoman for @entity75 , told @entity0			2
we are " motivated to have a transparent case that 's accountable to the community and to make sure justice is done at every level , " @entity73 said			1
5 things to know about the @entity7 shooting @entity73 said @entity14 's ties with police in the county could cloud his judgment			1
@entity14 's father was a police officer and was killed on the job in 1964 by an @entity28 man , when @entity14 was 12 , @entity14 's spokesperson @entity88 confirmed to @entity0			1
in addition to his father , @entity14 's brother , an uncle and a cousin all served with the @entity97 , and his mother worked as a clerk at the department , @entity88 said			2
@entity14 , who as a teenager lost a leg to cancer , made it his career ambition to become a prosecutor			1
he was quoted by the @entity108 as telling a reporter , while first campaigning for the office : " i could n't become a policeman , so being county prosecutor is the next best thing			2
" @entity14 has no plans to step aside and @entity88 said it does n't have any impact on how he will handle the current case			1
" i have absolutely no intention of walking away from duties and the responsibilities entrusted in me by the people of this community , " @entity14 said during the radio interview			0
while the @entity123 is conducting its own civil rights investigation , @entity3 elected officials are concerned about the local investigation			0
@entity14 has overseen controversial cases before , some including police officers and black suspects			2
complete coverage of the @entity7 shooting the petition being circulated points to a 2000 incident in which two suspected drug dealers were killed by two police officers , @entity14 never brought charges against the officers , concluding they acted in self - defense			1
a subsequent federal investigation found that the men were unarmed and not moving in the direction of the officers , but because the officers felt endangered , the investigation found that the shootings were justified , the @entity108 reported			0
" he does n't have the fortitude to do the right thing when it comes to prosecuting police officers , " @entity20 said on @entity0 's " newsroom " on tuesday			1
@entity152 , editorial director at the @entity153 , an @entity28 publication , said @entity14 has already " manipulated " the @entity7 case by the way he is releasing information			1
the @entity158 released a convenience store video from just minutes before @entity7 's death that showed a person who resembled @entity7 stealing a box of cigars			1
" all of this information should have come out all at once in group			0
by leaking out in pieces , he is encouraging this kind of speculation , " @entity152 said on @entity0 's " @entity166			2
" concerns about @entity14 arose again after @entity4 gov. @entity172 replaced the @entity158 with the @entity173 for security last week because he said the initial law enforcement response to the shooting was excessive			2
@entity14 told @entity0 affiliate @entity177 that the governor had " no legal authority " to make such a move			0
why no arrest yet ? upsetting to @entity3 residents , @entity4 state sen. @entity182 said , is that @entity184 , who has been identified as the officer who shot @entity7 , has not yet been arrested or charged			1
he is on paid administrative leave			0
it is up to the grand jury to determine what charges , if any , will be placed on @entity184			1
" i am concerned because my constituents are concerned , " @entity182 told @entity0			0
she said protesters carry signs or post signs in their yard demanding that @entity14 step aside			2
" they say this could have been me and if they killed someone they would immediately be in jail			0
" but @entity201 , a criminal defense attorney who previously was a police officer and a prosecutor , said the fact that @entity184 has not yet been charged or arrested is because he could have been acting in self - defense			1
evidence must be analyzed before an arrest is made or charges are brought			2
" police officers have no more or less of a right to self - defense " than private citizens , @entity201 said			2
autopsy results enough to charge officer , @entity7 family attorney says @entity88 , the county prosecutor 's spokesman , said , " the people of @entity15 have faith in mr. @entity14 and his ability to carry out his duties			1
" @entity14 has been prosecuting attorney since 1991 , and has been reelected to four - year terms ever since			0
he overwhelmingly won his primary on august 5 , just four days before @entity7 's death			1
he had an opponent for the first time since his 1994 campaign , facing off against an @entity28 - @entity28 woman , @entity227			0
she raised just $ 13,450 compared to @entity14 's $ 361,000 , according to the @entity228			0
friction between @entity14 and the governor the governor addressed concerns about @entity14			0
" he 's an experienced prosecutor , and this is his opportunity to step up , " @entity172 said sunday on @entity0 's " @entity233			1
" " it 's important we get this right			0
this is a big matter			0
" late tuesday night , he issued a statement saying he is not asking @entity14 to recuse himself but that it is up to @entity14 to remove himself from the case			0
" there is a well - established process by which a prosecutor can recuse themselves from a pending investigation , and a special prosecutor be appointed , " @entity172 said			1
" departing from this established process could unnecessarily inject legal uncertainty into this matter and potentially jeopardize the prosecution			0
" @entity14 slammed @entity172 's statement , saying he needs to " man up " and decide if he wants him to stay on the case			2
" it 's the typical @entity172 doublespeak , " @entity14 said on @entity48			0
" he says nothing and he 's ducking			0
" magazine : the aftermath in @entity3 read more about the flash point in the @entity258 at @entity0 / @entity259			0

any criminal case in @entity7 's shooting rests with prosecutor @entity263
some have little confidence that he will be *aggressive* in prosecuting police
they are asking for him to step aside and for a special prosecutor to be named
new : an attempt will be made on wednesday to present evidence to a grand jury
