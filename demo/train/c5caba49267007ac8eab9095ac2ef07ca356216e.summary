-- on @entity3 in @entity4 , a line of 26 black crosses stand in the sand , with the @entity6 behind them and a pot of flowers alongside			0
they are the tribute of the group @entity13 -- @entity14 -- to the victims at @entity16 , from a group that knows all too well what tragedies gun violence can inflict on society			1
@entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25 are among many countries that have seen terrible episodes of gun violence in recent years			1
but alongside the many expressions of sympathy and condolences that have poured into @entity32 , @entity33 , from around the world , there is also a sense of bewilderment that such tragedies happen on an almost routine basis in @entity39			1
" routine " may seem an exaggerated or callous description , but it was president @entity42 who said at an interfaith service sunday night in @entity32 : " we ca n't accept events like this as routine			0
" strangers inspired to honor @entity32 victims even so , commentaries from abroad often include a sense of resignation that not much can or will be done to prevent such atrocities in the future			0
@entity56 , who is @entity23 and blogs for @entity58 , writes of driving to his hometown of @entity60 in northern @entity61 , as he heard the news of the killings at @entity16			1
" nowhere have mass shootings been as prevalent as the @entity39 , and nowhere has the policy reaction been so pathetic , " he wrote this weekend			1
@entity66 , writing in the @entity23 's @entity68 , agreed			1
" no @entity39 politician will have the nerve to propose the only cure to this repetitive insanity , which would be a sensible , mature and responsible attitude towards the ownership and use of guns , " he predicted			1
in the @entity78 newspaper @entity77 , commentator @entity76 was more brutal			0
" @entity39 is not ready to talk about how it is easier to get a handgun than it is to see a doctor , not ready to speak about the video games that have extreme violence			1
it is just willing to sweep up everything under the carpet of tears			0
" and over at @entity88 , one of @entity78 's leading commentators , @entity91 , lamented a " combustible mix of angry @entity39 young men , often disturbed and usually white , spurred on by the pervasive and always growing presence of limitless violence in popular @entity39 culture , together with the easy - access , open market of guns and ammo , which together produce these shooting slaughters with such sickening regularity			1
... " and if you pour in the often gruesome violence so rampant in the computer and video games that so many @entity39 boys are weaned on and addicted to , it should come as no surprise , perhaps , that not only are the most evil and inhuman of mass murders possible , they may soon become commonplace , " he added			1
such observations are not new			0
five years ago @entity113 , @entity39 editor of @entity114 wrote in the @entity115 : " we might be a little surprised that a country with all the ingenuity and energy that @entity39 has seems simply to throw up its hands when it comes to guns , and in effect declares that the homicide rate and regular appalling school massacres , are insolvable problems			1
" @entity42 has now suggested otherwise -- broadening his existing support for a ban on assault weapons			0
" we ca n't tolerate this anymore ; these tragedies must end , " he said sunday			2
" we will be told that the causes are complex and that is true			0
no single law , no set of laws can eliminate evil and prevent acts of violence , but that ca n't be an excuse for inaction , " he continued			1
@entity143 : how @entity23 school massacre led to tighter gun control commentators and academics from other countries who have looked at this " inaction " in @entity39 often raise the following points			1
the polarization in @entity39 politics means that on the really difficult issues , paralysis is more likely than progress			2
the power of lobbying interests -- and in the case of guns that means the @entity162 -- contributes to that paralysis , they say			1
they also assert that the @entity165 and its political culture protects individual liberty -- or license -- to a much greater degree than is the case almost anywhere else			1
that includes allowing the ownership of powerful firearms capable of killing dozens within a minute			0
sixteen years ago , both @entity25 and the @entity23 saw gun rampages similar to those at @entity177 , the @entity179 temple in @entity180 , the theater in @entity182 , @entity183 , and @entity16			1
more : how other countries have dealt with massacres in the town of @entity143 , @entity189 , 16 children and one adult were shot dead at an elementary school in 1996			0
the gunman then shot himself			0
the atrocity led to revisions to the @entity194 that in effect banned the possession of handguns in @entity23			2
@entity198 , the minister who pushed the legislation through @entity200 , said after the @entity16 killings that he would " not put money " on @entity39 laws changing			1
in a @entity205 interview , @entity198 added : " i think sensible people want it to happen , but the @entity162 , which is this extraordinary gun lobby and gun manufacturers ' lobby , controls politics in a number of states			1
" one tweet put it more bluntly : " @entity143 , 1996			0
16 dead kids + adult			0
@entity23 govt. enacts new law			2
" in that same year , a 28 - year old @entity25 killed 35 people with two semiautomatic rifles in just eight minutes			2
then - prime minister @entity227 pushed through a law that banned assault weapons and instituted a gun buy - back policy			2
( some 650,000 were taken out of circulation			0
) @entity227 recalls telling an audience in @entity233 in 2008 that the law was among his proudest achievements in 12 years as prime minister			0
" there was an audible gasp of amazement , " he wrote in an op - ed this year in the @entity237			0
after the mass shooting in @entity182 this year , @entity227 said he was not optimistic it would change anything			0
" the responses of president @entity42 and @entity245 ... were as predictable as they were disappointing , " he said			0
" there are many @entity39 traits which we @entity25 could well emulate to our great benefit			1
but when it comes to guns we have been right to take a radically different path , " @entity227 concluded			0
@entity25 - born media magnate @entity254 chimed in saturday on his @entity256 account : " when will politicians find courage to ban automatic weapons ? as in @entity260 after similar tragedy			2
" some columnists do n't detect any popular pressure in the @entity39 for change , even if the gun control debate has flared in the wake of the @entity16 shooting			1
@entity268 , who writes for the @entity270 newspaper @entity269 , observes that " support for stricter gun laws has been steadily declining for decades			2
according to @entity274 , it is 44 % , but twelve years ago it was 66 %			0
" debate rages about the relationship between the availability of guns in society and the number of deaths caused by guns			0
but the laws enacted in the @entity23 and @entity25 sharply restricting gun ownership do appear to have made a difference			1
a study ( @entity288 ) by researchers at @entity290 in 2011 found that in the 18 years before the new law was enacted in @entity25 , a total of 13 gun attacks had led to four or more fatalities			1
in the 16 years since the new law , the number was zero			0
individual homicides involving guns have also fallen			0
@entity298 has some of the most restrictive regulations in the world on gun ownership			1
shotgun licenses for hunting require a lengthy application ; handguns are forbidden			0
homicides by gunfire in @entity298 rarely get into double figures in a year			0
in the view of author @entity312 , who has studied @entity298 's gun control laws in great detail , its regulations work because they are " part of a vast mosaic of social control ... a pervasive cultural theme that the individual is subordinate to society and to the government			1
" that would not be acceptable in the @entity39			2
even so , while recognizing the power of the @entity325 , foreign commentators are not shy of recommending what could and should be done to tackle gun violence in the @entity39 in the @entity23 , @entity328 editorialized in the wake of the @entity32 shootings : " a proper federal system of regulation , including background checks registration , and limits on the type and number of weapons an individual can own , would bring the @entity39 belatedly into line with other civilized countries , as would a determined push back against state legislation allowing the carrying of concealed weapons in public			1
" hours before the @entity16 massacre , @entity347 lawmakers passed legislation allowing those with concealed pistol licenses to carry guns into schools , hospitals and churches among other places			0
in the words of one commentator : " no society that holds itself up as an example to the world should , as the @entity39 does , brazenly shrug off what are clearly deep national character flaws when it comes to our love of guns or our celebration of hate politics			2
" the writer was not a foreigner , but an @entity39 -- @entity371 -- writing in @entity372			2
and he was writing not this weekend , but after @entity373 shot and killed six people , and injured more than a dozen , including @entity39 rep. @entity376 , in january 2011 .			2

@entity25 and @entity23 also have had terrible episodes of gun violence in recent years
these countries enacted laws sharply restricting gun ownership after tragedies
" nowhere has the policy reaction been so pathetic , " @entity23 blogger says of @entity39
observers point to power of @entity162 , political culture that protects individual liberty
