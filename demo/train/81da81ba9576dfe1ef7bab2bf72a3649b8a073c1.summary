@entity0 , @entity1 -- there are no rock stars at @entity5 , no household names			1
but this annual conference in coastal @entity1 is a hub for super-smart people , a chance to get a look into ideas and technologies that soon will change the world			1
here 's a quick look at five of them , chosen from many			2
you can see the full list of @entity5 presenters and fellows on the group 's website			1
@entity23 , ' real - life batman ' @entity23 , who founded @entity25 , sees the world with his ears			1
a self - described " batman , " @entity23 , who is blind , makes clicking sounds with his tongue when he walks the streets or goes hiking in the woods			1
he listens for those sounds to bounce off the objects around him , and uses that data to construct a mental image of the scene			0
he has taught these methods of human echolocation to about 500 students on several continents			0
with his help , these blind students have learned to ride bikes through obstacle courses , skateboard and , perhaps most importantly , achieve greater independence			0
" you 're basically querying the environment -- you 're interrogating the environment , " he said			1
" you 're asking who are you and what are you , and the environment answers back			1
" @entity54 , game designer for most people , gaming is a form of entertainment or escape			0
for @entity54 , a computer scientist at @entity61 , games can help solve real - world problems			1
@entity54 is the creator of @entity63 , a computer game that has helped solve long - standing puzzles about protein folding			1
the work of @entity63 is even helping to enhance science 's understanding of @entity70			0
his new game , called @entity72 , does the same thing for @entity74			0
most important about these games , he says , is the fact that they 're fun			1
and by having fun , gamers also are helping improve the world			2
@entity81 , advocate for ' maker ' culture if you live in the western world , chances are you ca n't make much of anything			1
if you want a shirt , you buy it			0
if you want an internet connection , you buy a router			0
no one knows much about these processes -- well , no one except " makers " like @entity81 , who is creating a website to connect people who make things in the developing world with other people on the internet who might be able to help			2
the site , called @entity104 , is expected to launch next summer			0
it will be yet another portal into a growing trend : people want to know where things come from and how they 're produced			2
increasingly , people like @entity81 just want to make things for themselves			0
he grows plants in his yard in @entity114 that he spins into shirts and sweaters			0
he hopes his website will support projects like one by @entity119 at a group called @entity121 , which , among other things , helped makers in @entity124 create a localized version of the internet in their hometown			0
@entity128 , the locust whisperer why do fish swim in schools ? why do locusts fly in swarms ? @entity128 , a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at @entity136 , is trying to understand how and why organisms function as a collective rather than individuals			0
he 's using new and innovative methods , from computer vision to @entity143 cameras , to get at the answers			0
( it turns out , for example , that locusts swam not because they love flying in giant clumps , but because they 're trying to eat each other -- and avoid being eaten by the locusts hot on their tails			2
) there are practical applications to this work			0
one of @entity128 's long - term goals , for example , is to understand locusts well enough to be able to predict their swarming patterns			2
that may sound like no big deal if you 're sitting in an @entity164 city and have n't seen a locust swarm this week -- or ever			1
but in lots of places , including @entity169 , locust swarms severely impact people 's livelihoods			0
@entity173 , 13 - year - old solar scientist who knows what you were doing at age 13 , but i 'm guessing you were n't walking through the woods , looking at trees and noticing how the spiraling pattern of the branches follow a mathematical construct called the fibonacci sequence			1
for a school science project , this 13 - year - old used these observations to design a new type of solar panel array that 's based on @entity191 and the structure of trees			1
the prototype looks like a tree with little solar panels at the tips of the branches			2
he says it catches more light and produces about 20 % more electricity than traditional solar panel arrangements			2
the discovery earned him a @entity205 this year from the @entity206 ; and it got him plenty of high praise at @entity5 , with plenty of decades - older university types expressing awe at his work .			1

@entity5 is a yearly conference that *focuses* on tech and *social* change
the *speakers* are n't household names , but they 're working to change the world
among them : a 13 - year - old solar power developer ; a man who sees with his ears
