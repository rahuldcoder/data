@entity0 -- the @entity2 on friday ramped up its warnings urging @entity4 not to join other activists in a flotilla , expected to sail soon , aimed at challenging @entity8 's maritime blockage of the @entity9			1
according to organizers , the flotilla is meant to commemorate the one - year anniversary of a similar flotilla that resulted in a clash in international waters with @entity8 navy commandos that left nine people -- including an @entity4 citizen -- dead			1
secretary of state @entity19 told reporters friday that she did n't think the plan " is useful or productive or helpful to the people of @entity9			2
" " we have certainly encouraged that @entity4 citizens not participate in the flotilla , " she said , " and we are urging that all precautions be taken to avoid any kind of confrontation			0
" @entity29 's comments followed an even harsher statement by @entity2 spokesperson @entity31 , in which she criticized what she called " irresponsible and provocative actions that risk the safety of their passengers			0
" last may , the @entity39 -- owned by the @entity40 , or @entity41 -- and five other ships were on their way to @entity9 , carrying humanitarian aid and about 700 activists from various countries , when @entity8 soldiers swarmed aboard it			2
despite international condemnation , an independent @entity8 commission , led by retired judge @entity51 , later found that @entity8 commandos " acted professionally and in a measured manner in the face of unanticipated violence " when they seized the @entity9 - bound aid ship			2
in september , the @entity58 found @entity8 forces " committed serious violations of international law " in the raid and suggested that six of the civilian deaths were " consistent with ... an arbitrary and summary execution			1
" @entity8 called the report " as biased and as one - sided as the body that has produced it			0
" the @entity2 earlier this week issued a travel warning advisting @entity4 citizens " against traveling to @entity9 by any means , including via sea			2
" " previous attempts to enter @entity9 by sea have been stopped by @entity8 naval vessels and resulted in the injury , death , arrest , and deportation of @entity4 citizens , " the @entity2 statement said			1
" @entity4 citizens participating in any effort to reach @entity9 by sea should understand that they may face arrest , prosecution , and deportation by the government of @entity8			1
" @entity88 , a blogger for the @entity89 and supporter of the protest , accused @entity29 of seeming to " lay the ground -- indeed almost provide a green light -- for an @entity8 military attack on the upcoming @entity95			1
" activists say the blockade is illegal and has worked to undermine @entity9 's already fledgling economy			0
@entity8 has promised to block any attempt to break a blockade that they say is important in keeping weapons from being delivered to @entity9			0
the protesters said they raised funds to purchase a @entity4 - flagged vessel , which they named " @entity106 , " a reference to the best - selling book of the same title by president @entity110			0
the boat , they claim , will carry 36 passengers , four crew members , and ten journalists			0
the protesters say they want to " challenge @entity4 foreign policy " by providing aid and supplies directly to the citizens of @entity9 , in spite of @entity8 's blockade			1
" we encourage all @entity4 to support our voyage , and to agitate with the @entity4 government and public opinion to ensure our safe passage to @entity9 , " wrote @entity122 , policy director at the advocacy group @entity123 , who said he 'll be part of the flotilla			1
the @entity2 counters that , if the activists want to help the citizens of @entity9 , there is a better -- and legal -- way to do it			0
@entity31 , the department 's spokeswoman , told reporters , " we 've got to use the channels that are safe , the channels that are going to guarantee that the aid get where it needs to go to the people it 's intended for			0
" @entity29 added thursday that it would be unwise to move toward @entity8 waters and create " a situation in which the @entity8 have the right to defend themselves			0
" but these words did not impress @entity88 , who wrote that " in light of @entity29 's statements , if any blood is spilled it will not only be on @entity8 , but also @entity4 hands			1

50 people plan to sail to @entity9 to protest @entity8 's blockage of the @entity155 area
last year , 9 were *killed* after @entity8 forces confronted a similar flotilla
sec. of @entity29 calls the plan not " useful , " urges @entity4 not to take part
an activist say the @entity4 is giving @entity8 the " green light " to attack the flotilla
