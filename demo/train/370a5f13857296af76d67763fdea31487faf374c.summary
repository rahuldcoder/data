, @entity0 has launched a new offensive through its proxies in @entity9			1
facing a full - blown crisis , with the @entity0 economy estimated to be contracting by at least 5 % this year , @entity0 president @entity10 seems to be unconcerned about further economic pressure and diplomatic isolation			2
is he irrational ? as the only one making important decisions in @entity0 today , does @entity10 not care about the sanctions ? he is not and he does			1
his is a multiphased , well - calibrated endgame to destabilize @entity9 and to weaken the sanctions at the same time			1
the first thing for the @entity20 to understand is that , in the short run , no amount of sanctions will force @entity0 to leave @entity9 -- not until the @entity24 achieves victory , which @entity10 appears to have defined as @entity9 's almost unconditional capitulation			1
until then , any " peace initiatives " and " accords " signed by @entity0 are not worth the paper they are written on			2
having raised the propaganda pitch to a " motherland - in - danger " level unheard of since @entity33 , @entity10 has been telling @entity0 that the war in @entity9 is about " defending our independence and our right to exist , " and that the @entity9 are nothing more than the first line of @entity42 's attack			1
the popular mobilization to protect the motherland from the alleged " @entity42 aggression " has become the key to @entity10 's popularity and , by extension , to the regime 's legitimacy			0
climbing down from such rhetorical heights without a clear victory in sight , especially during an economic crisis , could be very dangerous politically			0
what sort of victory could @entity10 be envisioning ? first , humiliated and bled dry on the battlefield , @entity9 would be forced to agree to a " federated " structure and recognize the " autonomy " of its southeast region that would make it a de facto @entity0 protectorate inside @entity9			1
the " people 's republics " of @entity68 and @entity69 would have their own political , legal and security systems and their " defense forces " would not be disarmed			0
nor would @entity0 " volunteers " be repatriated			2
completely controlled by @entity73 , the republics ' authorities would be in charge of all elections within their territories			0
a permanent bloc of seats in the @entity9 parliament would be set aside for them , giving them ( that is , @entity0 ) de facto veto power over @entity9 's key political , security and foreign policy choices			1
finally , there would be no restoration of @entity9 sovereignty over the @entity89 - @entity9 border and no end to the flow of @entity0 military and civilian supplies into @entity9			1
with these arrangements in place , the @entity24 would be able to re-ignite the conflict instantaneously whenever it did not like what @entity97 is doing or , more importantly , whenever @entity0 's domestic political situation called for another round of propaganda - induced patriotic hysteria and anti-west paranoia			2
with such a victory , @entity10 would get very close to achieving his goal since the @entity9 revolution 11 months ago : punish , humiliate , dismember , destabilize and , ultimately , destroy a @entity107 - bound @entity9			2
@entity9 's de facto surrender would also put pressure on the @entity20 to weaken and ultimately lift the sanctions			1
how could the @entity111 and the @entity6 continue to punish @entity0 when the government in @entity97 had agreed to such a " peace " ? given @entity10 's determination and the resources he has put behind it , his endgame will have a high probability of success , but it is not preordained			2
the only way to thwart @entity10 's ambitions is through @entity0 domestic politics			0
a strong resistance by @entity97 would force @entity10 to intensify and widen the scope of the campaign			0
this would require an increase of regular @entity0 troops in @entity9 ( estimated last year by @entity42 at 1,000 and by the @entity9 last month at 9,000 ) to at least 15,000 to 20,000			1
@entity0 casualties are likely to rise proportionately to the number of troops , reminding the families of @entity0 soldiers of the bloody 1979 - ' 89 @entity136 war in @entity137 , which greatly contributed to the unraveling of the @entity136 regime 's legitimacy			0
@entity10 will be reluctant to choose this option , and the extreme political sensitivity of the issue explains the secrecy about @entity0 casualties and the creation earlier this year of a @entity0 " foreign legion " to minimize the losses of regular @entity0 troops			0
but in the short run , @entity0 's defeat on the battlefield is anyhow unlikely because of the continuing disarray in the @entity9 defense establishment			1
this stems largely from the @entity136 or @entity0 - trained top brass , which is not especially anxious to fight their comrades , as well as from the lack of manpower , poor training and the absence of modern defense weapons , especially anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles			0
so what can the @entity20 do ? for the moment , keeping up sanctions is critical			0
while they are far from the most damaging of the @entity24 's economic maladies , they raise the stakes for @entity73 at a time of deepening economic crisis and rapidly shrinking budgets			0
by preventing @entity0 companies from borrowing or selling debt in the @entity20 , they force @entity10 to choose between bailing out , for example , the oil giant @entity187 or the huge @entity188 , or keeping hospitals open even in @entity73 , which is relatively well - off compared to the rest of the country ; between paying the kontraktniki " volunteer " soldiers who fight in @entity9 and raising the pensions of tens of millions retirees and the salaries of doctors and teachers to keep up with inflation			1
far from being the product of a delusion of grandeur , @entity10 's endgame is based on hard military and geopolitical realities			0
if @entity97 , @entity199 and @entity200 are serious about resisting it , they ought to be as realistic , as determined and as creative .			0

tensions have flared again in eastern @entity9
@entity205 : in short run , no amount of sanctions will force @entity0 out of @entity9
