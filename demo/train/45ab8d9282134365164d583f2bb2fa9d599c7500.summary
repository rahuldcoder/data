-- a @entity2 police officer shot and killed a teenager tuesday night in @entity4 , @entity2 , just 2 miles from the @entity6 suburb of @entity7 , where @entity8 was killed by police , an event that set off protests across the country			1
but even though both cases involve white officers and black teens , @entity14 's mayor said the incidents are not the same			2
surveillance video appears to show a person -- identified by police and his family as @entity24 , 18 -- pointing a gun at an officer in a gas station parking lot in @entity4 right before the officer fatally shot the teen , @entity4 mayor @entity19 told reporters wednesday			1
@entity31 released on @entity33 videos from three different angles that captured parts of the scene			2
the shooting led to a tense couple of hours at the station , where scuffles with police broke out -- and what appeared to be lit fireworks were thrown -- as scores of people gathered to see what happened in an area still emotional over the august 9 shooting of @entity8			1
but @entity19 , who is black , said that this shooting can not be likened to @entity8 's death , in part because unlike the @entity7 case , this one was captured on video and allegedly involves an armed teen			1
" we reviewed the video and it appears that there was a gun pointed at the officer before the officer fired , " @entity19 said			0
it " does not appear that the police officer initiated " the incident , he said			2
@entity19 promised a thorough investigation			0
" i will not tolerate brutality of any policeman on our citizens , " @entity19 told @entity0			0
he added that people can " rest assured that i will investigate this independently and make a complete report to the community			0
" gov. @entity74 issued a brief statement saying , " the events in @entity4 are a reminder that law enforcement officers have a difficult , and often dangerous , job in protecting themselves and law - abiding citizens			1
" a small group of protesters marched along some roads , including a highway , on wednesday night , with some help from police			1
" police are actually blocking the intersections for the protesters , " @entity89 reporter @entity88 tweeted			1
still , six to eight protesters were nevertheless arrested for blocking off part of @entity96 in @entity4 , @entity0 affiliate @entity93 reported			1
@entity24 faced a series of criminal charges over the past 15 months according to @entity93 , including assault , armed robbery , unlawful use of a weapon , armed criminal action and stealing			1
the station showed @entity24 's tearful mother @entity105 saying her son was " trying to get his life back together			1
" police : officer was investigating alleged theft county police chief @entity112 said the shooting was tragic , but stressed the teen pointed a gun " straight out " at the officer , who fired in self - defense			1
" i understand the emotions ... but i think we need to understand the context of what happens ... with these types of situations , " @entity112 , whose department is investigating the shooting , told reporters			2
@entity112 said the officer , a 34 - year - old , six - year @entity4 police veteran , was responding to a report of a theft when he pulled into the parking lot of a @entity133 gas station in @entity4 shortly before 11:15 p.m. he left his cruiser and talked to two men in the lot			1
eventually , as the officer stood by the driver 's side tire of his cruiser , one of the men backed away from the cruiser 's passenger side headlight , then stepped forward again pointing a gun at the officer , @entity112 said			0
the officer , whom police did not name , lost balance and fell as he moved back in reaction , but managed to fire what investigators believe were three shots , hitting the gunman at least once , @entity112 said			2
the slain teen is not believed to have fired his weapon , a loaded 9 mm handgun that police recovered at the scene , @entity112 said			2
@entity31 later released a photo of the weapon			0
meanwhile , there was a shooting in @entity6 on wednesday			2
@entity0 affiliate @entity93 reported one person was shot to death and three were in critical condition			0
no other details were immediately available			0
surveillance video , but body camera was n't worn in the @entity24 case , video released by authorities showed a second man nearby who fled when the shooting occurred			1
authorities are looking to interview him			2
@entity24 's father , @entity176 , said his son had indicated he was going out to meet his girlfriend and had not mentioned any other person who might be with them			1
" he was supposed to come home , " @entity176 said			0
" we 're getting ready for the holiday ; everyone wanted to see him			0
my grandmother had n't seen him for a while			0
" the officer involved was given a body camera before he left for patrol , but he was n't wearing it during the shooting , possibly because he was distracted when a supervisor gave it to him earlier tuesday , @entity112 said			2
@entity19 said this did n't bother him , in part because the city , with three cameras for its 31 officers , had just started training officers to use them			0
the cruiser 's dashboard camera also was n't recording , because the car 's emergency lights had n't been activated , @entity112 said			0
the officer will be placed on administrative leave until the investigation is completed			0
@entity176 said @entity24 lived with his parents , brother and sister			1
protest , scuffle protesters late tuesday and early wednesday gathered around an ethnically diverse group of dozens of police officers , who stood between them and the scene			1
people in the crowd screamed at police			2
what looked like a firework exploded near a gas pump , scattering people and temporarily filling the area with thick , white smoke , video from @entity0 affiliate @entity93 showed			0
four people were arrested on suspicion of assaulting officers , @entity112 said			0
one police officer was sent to an emergency room after injuring himself while trying to get away from the firework , @entity112 said			2
another officer was treated at a hospital after being hit in the head with a rock or a brick , @entity112 said			0

@entity93 video showed a white plume rising at another location down the street			0
@entity112 said someone had tried to set a fire at a nearby store , but someone extinguished it			0
before sunup , protesters thinned out , and those remaining stood calmly behind police tape			1
tuesday 's incident came about a month after a @entity262 grand jury declined to indict @entity7 police officer @entity263 for fatally shooting @entity8 on august 9			1
authorities said @entity8 , who was black , was n't armed at the time , but that he tried to take @entity263 's gun while the officer was in his vehicle during an encounter in @entity7			1
some witness accounts said @entity263 left his car and eventually fired while @entity8 , 18 , had his hands up in surrender , but others disputed this			0
police said @entity263 fired in self - defense as @entity8 charged him			1
@entity4 is a city of about 8,000 people flanked by @entity278 to the west and @entity7 to the east			1
