rear adm. @entity50 , a @entity51 spokesman , said friday that the increased estimates wo n't alter how the @entity27 approaches @entity8 , a group that he insisted " nobody has underestimated			1
" " the 20,000 to 31,500 estimate does n't necessarily change ... our estimate or ( defense secretary @entity58 's ) belief that this is going to be a long - term struggle , " @entity50 said			1
@entity50 added , " we 're not just simply about degrading and destroying ... the 20 to 30,000 ( @entity8 fighters )			1
it 's about degrading and destroying their capabilities to attack targets , particularly @entity66 targets			2

" @entity117 as young as 8 and 9 years old with @entity127 , they are recruiting and brainwashing with this evil ideology , " he said -- in the same way as @entity122 in @entity6 sought to recruit them in the past , but on a far bigger scale			2
@entity129 says he believes that @entity117 and @entity38 probably constitute more than 70 % of @entity8 fighters			1
they add sizable bulk to the number of foreign fighters			0
" these foreign fighters , when we squeeze them in @entity6 and in @entity38 , they will permeate , they will infiltrate , they will cross the borders to @entity78 , to @entity98 -- they have already started doing that and into @entity142 , and @entity2 is not very far , " he said			1
he warned that @entity144 nations are " not immune " from the threat they pose			0
" i believe they should work very hard with us -- intelligence and cutting the oxygen from the terrorists , stopping the money , stopping the traveling of these terrorists , the young men , coming from @entity2 and ( @entity144 nations ) and @entity156			0
" @entity88 have joined @entity8 to fight --- and die -- in @entity38 in the cross hairs recognizing the threat that @entity8 poses , president @entity158 laid out a plan this week to " dismantle and ultimately destroy " @entity8 , including authorizing airstrikes			1
