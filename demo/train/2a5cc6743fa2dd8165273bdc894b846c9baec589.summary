-- for more than a year , @entity1 , a @entity2 student , waited tables alongside @entity5 migrant workers in a restaurant in @entity7			1
while there he received an intimate glimpse of what work life is like for millions in mainland @entity5			1
" nothing was ever really clear , " said @entity1 , who is now back in @entity2			2
" in the @entity14 , people state their mind			2
in @entity5 , there was no sharing of ideas			1
when it came to new processes , no one ever offered any input			2
people were so afraid of doing something wrong			2
" though @entity1 's circumstance in @entity5 was rare -- a foreigner working alongside migrant workers in local eateries is not common -- his experience in a @entity5 workplace is one that experts say is common			1
whether a restaurant or a massive company , businesses in @entity5 revolve around perplexing power structures , where innovative thinking is often stymied , partly by an education system that prioritizes rote memorization over creative thinking , and partly because employees are afraid of offering input that might insult the intelligence of their boss			1
" it is still pretty much a hierarchical culture when it comes to office politics , " said @entity47 , author of " inside the @entity5 mind : a guide on how @entity54 " who believes that @entity5 workplace culture is deeply rooted in @entity57 , an ancient philosophy centered on obeisance to authority			1
" if you are in line with the boss and present a creative business plan , you can bypass a lot of the bureaucratic stuff , " said @entity47			0
" on the other hand , if you are not in that line of power , even if you have creative ideas you will not be able to gain access , so in a way that is limiting creativity in all parts of the company because of the hierarchical nature of the organization			2
" regardless of whether or not the @entity79 tradition continues to impinge @entity5 's ability to transition its economy to one based on innovation rather than manufacturing , office culture in the country is changing			1
more multi-national companies have established branches in the country and tech - savvy young @entity5 are exposed to international norms via the internet			1
most who work in fields related to management studies in @entity5 say that offices are becoming more democratized with traditional power structures fading away where employees are equals and ideas can be shared and criticized openly			1
" it is difficult to tell how fast it is evolving , " @entity100 , an associate professor of management at the @entity102 in @entity7 , said			0
" we need to first define with what group of employees			0
" the group of employees who appear to be the most influential are those born in the 1980s and 1990s			0
according to @entity100 members of @entity5 's " @entity111 " are less loyal to their employers , are seeking jobs that are fulfilling and are seeking to become a part of something bigger and more meaningful			1
" not only the white collar workers , even blue collar workers , they are expecting more fair status , more learning opportunities			1
they want their supervisors to be more advisors rather than just a boss , " @entity100 said			0
" performance evaluation has been over-focused on growth , an emphasis on the results and the numbers instead of the process , " she said			0
" as a result , people have been treated as human resources , which is not a very good term to refer to people			0
if you focus too much on growth , you ignore the relationship side of the team , the softer side of people			0
many companies are trying to adjust to this problem			2
" adjusting to this problem means finding leaders who break from the status quo and can foster a new culture of " empowerment and trust - based management , " said @entity150 , an executive coach at @entity151 in @entity152			0
" the older managers , the command - and - control style management , that was in the past , " she said			0
" organizations are looking for creativity and innovative thinking , and these younger employees are thirsty to be providing that			0
the trick is how to have a culture to unlock that creativity			0
there is a catching up that needs to be done			0
catching up is a possibility , but we ca n't expect it to happen overnight			2
" in @entity171 , a technology hub in @entity152 , it does seem that change has happened almost overnight			0
only a couple of years ago , debates especially among foreign executives and investors working there complained of the dearth of innovation and lack of skilled entrepreneurs in @entity5			1
now there are more start - ups than ever , with some growing into major companies with operations overseas			2
a number of these new businesses as well as big @entity5 internet companies , like @entity188 , @entity5 's top search engine , say they have been directly influenced by the open , collaborative work environments pioneered by the likes of @entity193 and @entity194			1
yet while the two @entity197 tech giants have had a major affect on it companies in @entity5 , they have suffered their own well - publicized failures in the country because of what many have said was an inability to adjust to local cultural norms both in business and in office politics			1
" we did learn a lot from @entity209 companies , " @entity210 , senior director of business development for @entity212 , a @entity5 social gaming company that has grown from six employees to more than 500 and operates internationally			1
" the management style changed and had to change			0
now we need to respect every single employee because they are aware they are the top talent in the industry			0
