@entity0 -- last night , police raided and evicted protesters from the @entity5 site			0
this comes on the heels of recent police crackdowns on occupy encampments all across the country			1
but if you think that 's the end of the 99 % movement , guess again			1
it 's still just getting started			1
to be clear , the occupy camps are for the most part rigorously and passionately nonviolent and , incidentally , much cleaner than most would expect			2
but there are a few punks in the crowds , mixed in with some who have sought shelter in the camps who bring along struggles with mental illness or drug addiction			0
in other words , the 99 % movement is n't violent ; sadly , our society in general can be violent , and that violence seeps into even the most well - meaning spaces			1
and enemies of the middle class would use any ammunition they could find to attack the 99 % movement and evict the protesters			2
nonetheless , the occupy camps gave urgent birth to a movement that was long - gestating in the anger and frustration of ordinary @entity38			1
now that it 's been kicked out of the house , it 's time for the 99 % movement to grow up			1
movements are , of course , always moving -- and so it 's impossible to predict where they will go			2
but i expect a couple of key shifts in the coming weeks			0
judge orders @entity0 to allow protesters , tents , in park first , look for the 99 % movement to move away from the " occupy " tactic			1
holding public ground for public protests has captured the attention of the nation in a way few other protests ever have			0
but behind the scenes , protesters were increasingly worried that the problems associated with the camps are starting to outweigh the benefits			0
plus it 's getting damn cold out and , even in nice weather , the occupy sites take a lot of energy to maintain			1
no movement should be beholden to a limited set of tactics			2
the colonial americans did n't just keep throwing boxes of tea into bodies of water			0
the civil rights protesters did n't stop at sit - ins and bus boycotts			0
similar to the " @entity88 " campaign calling on the 99 % to divest their checking and savings accounts from the top job - killing banks on @entity87 , i think we 'll start to see more experimental tactics that draw on mass action and public engagement without necessarily being rooted in outdoor sleepovers			0
this will be messy at first , with many misses and few hits , but is an essential next step if the 99 % movement is to continue			2
second , look for leaders to emerge			1
the occupy camps have been fervent in their supposedly leaderless structures , frustrating critics and media observers alike			1
but , as keen analysts have observed , the 99 % movement is , in fact , leader - full -- creating opportunities for everyday @entity38 who 've felt cast out of the political process to find their voice and vision and work with others to achieve their goals			0
the movement is n't anti-leadership but rather pro-leadership to the point where it 's investing in building the power and skills of thousands of new leaders			1
yet given the practical limitations to an entirely decentralized , consensus - based decision - making process ( which , among other things , allows a few vocal yahoos in favor of property destruction to have too much sway ) , clusters of leaders will start to emerge in the struggle to define the movement 's next phase			1
but do n't expect them to look anything like the " leaders " we 're used to			0
instead , they 'll include single moms and construction workers and recent college graduates and homeless people			0
because of who they are and the way they lead in the context of the larger movement , they will redefine our understanding of leadership			0
third , wait for factions to splinter			0
while we 'd all love to keep holding hands and singing " @entity152 , " the reality is that as the 99 % movement gets bigger , so do the stakes and various differences and divisions that once seemed trivial become impossible to ignore			0
the small minority within the protests who are eager to vandalize property and confront police will , let 's hope , be sidelined and that their reckless acts will be seen as doing violence to the larger mission of the movement			1
of course , it would be great if these small factions could be educated and transformed , but the reality is that in every movement , left and right , there 's a fringe and , ultimately , a moment where that fringe is no longer accommodated but rejected			1
the raids and evictions may be the impetus for this shift in the 99 % movement			2
whatever happens next , it 's clear that the movement to make our economy and political system work for the 99 % has barely completed the first 1 % of its long and vital journey			2
you can evict protesters , but you can never evict a growing idea			0
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity190 .			2

despite crackdowns , the occupy movement is just getting started , says @entity190
look for the movement to shift away from the " occupy " tactic , @entity190 predicts
@entity190 : watch for leaders to emerge , despite the movement being " leaderless "
the movement 's violent fringes will probably soon be sidelined , says @entity190
