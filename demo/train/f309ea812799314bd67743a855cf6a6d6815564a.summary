-- president @entity1 is having a tough time			1
the defeat of the gun control legislation was devastating			1
despite strong public support for tighter regulations and the backing of a bipartisan coalition , a furious blitz from gun lobby groups persuaded enough senators to kill the legislation			2
the bill 's sponsors could not find the 60 senators needed to stop a filibuster			2
one would think that the horrific tragedy of @entity19 , @entity20 , where 20 children and six adults were shot and killed at the @entity23 , would be enough to move lawmakers to impose some regulations , such as tougher background checks			0
but it was n't enough			0
now the president faces another challenge with immigration reform			1
a bipartisan group in the @entity32 , led by @entity33 and @entity34 , has put together an immigration bill that includes a path to legalization for the 11 million unauthorized immigrants in this country and tighter border control			1
it appears that the bill has a chance to pass the @entity32			2
but will @entity45 @entity44 subvert the deal ? opinion : did we learn nothing from @entity19 ? immediately after @entity51 killed the gun control legislation , critics started pointing to the president 's hesitation to twist arms and lean on members of @entity51			1
in what has become a familiar refrain , @entity1 was no @entity59			2
yet @entity1 's trouble has much more to do with the way government works than his skill , or lack thereof , at working @entity66			1
too much emphasis is placed on the small picture of what he does or does not do in his personal interactions with @entity51 , or his " messaging			0
" actually , it 's not so much him as the government			2
@entity1 understood this when he ran for president in 2008			1
he spoke constantly about the need to reform the government and the way in which our political processes hamper the ability of @entity51 and the president to take action			1
yet once he was president , @entity1 put the issue of reform on the back burner			1
he decided to focus on the policy challenges ahead , generally dismissing the idea that there was much chance for him to make government work better			2
in certain cases , such as with the use of private money and political action committees , he decided to join the game and make sure it worked to his advantage			0
the decision has come at a cost			0
opinion : gun control fight just beginning throughout his presidency , @entity1 has struggled as private interest groups have continued to exert enormous power over the legislative process			1
when @entity1 pushed his health care law through @entity51 , he felt the need to abandon hugely important measures that would have imposed tough cost controls			1
he did so to placate powerful interest groups in the medical industry who were dead set against these measures			0
the financial regulations imposed by the @entity116 , passed in response to the financial crisis of 2008 , have struggled as interest groups continually undercut their effectiveness by persuading legislators to avoid any kind of tough implementation			0
this time around , gun rights organizations -- from giants such as the @entity125 to smaller operations -- conducted a massive and unyielding blitz on legislators			0
even bipartisan support , a rarity in @entity131 , was not enough for the bill to succeed			0
other issues , such as tax reform to close loopholes , have simply been abandoned because they seem so impossible given the power of lobbyists and campaign contributors who lurk on @entity139			0
the power of money makes it extremely difficult for politicians to go out on a limb			0
the filibuster has also remained the chronic obstacle for @entity1			2
with the constant threat of the filibuster against almost any piece of legislation , almost every bill requires a 60 - vote super majority in the @entity32			0
this makes it hard to build a coalition behind legislation and in most cases allows small factions within a party to subvert presidential proposals			0
presidents usually need bipartisan support to get 60 votes , and bipartisanship is almost impossible nowadays			0
opinion : one way to fight guns this was certainly a challenge for gun rights , and could make immigration reform vulnerable in the final stages of debate			1
as with money and politics , the filibuster has also made other issues altogether impossible to consider even			0
when the immigration bill reaches the @entity45 , the trouble will begin			1
@entity45 members in gerrymandered districts care about the party activists who tend to be the loudest voices			0
the situation to avoid is one where the @entity44 caucus drifts further to the right even while counterparts in the @entity32 and public opinion support immigration reform			1
the truth is we will never know what was possible in that transformative moment that followed @entity1 's historic election or after his re-election in 2012			1
but without reforming our government , the path to gridlock is not going to disappear			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity199 .			2

@entity199 : the defeat of the gun control bill was devastating for the @entity1 administration
@entity199 : now the president faces another tough challenge with immigration reform
@entity1 's trouble has more to do with how government works rather than his skills , he says
@entity199 : without reforming government , the path to gridlock is not going to disappear
