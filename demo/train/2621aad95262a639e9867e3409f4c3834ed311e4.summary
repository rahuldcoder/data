-- @entity1 is the season for new beginnings and budding romances			0
there are couples canoodling as they dine alfresco outside restaurants everywhere			0
you can practically smell the sizzling steaks as you stroll down the street			0
and you ca n't walk in the park without stumbling on a romantic picnic			1
@entity1 is all about dining in the great outdoors			0
it 's about love and it 's about barbecue sauce			1
as someone who has dated any number of men who make @entity21 look like @entity22 , i should know			0
my dyspeptic dating disasters inspired me to conduct a study of the male species via their stomachs			0
i interviewed more than 200 men and women about the connection between a man 's wining and dining style and his mating style			1
i discovered you can divine a man 's essence from his culinary style			1
but before you fall head - over - @entity39 for a likely hunk , consider whether he is likely to give you heartburn			0
now , there is no prescription for love			0
we each have to find our flavor			0
some of us love @entity47 and burgers and others amongst us enjoy being serenaded with fragrant , freshly cooked pasta and piquant pinots			0
whatever our tastes are we should heed what his dining style says about him and consider whether it dovetails to ours			1
otherwise , in the long term the relationship may end up being hard to stomach			0
consider if you really want to end up dating someone with the lifestyle habits of @entity63 or , for that matter , @entity66 " seven - ounce " @entity65			1
while we often wear ros√© - tinted lenses on dates that obscure us from seeing the real man , food does n't lie			0
what he puts on his plate -- and yours for that matter -- creates a very telling portrait of what he will dish up as a partner			0
and there is no spicier season when it comes to matters of the heart and the hotplate			0
here is a rundown of some of the three most popular spring dining dates and what to watch out for to get an idea if he is the perfect male dish or a recipe for romantic salmonella			0
the @entity94 there is nothing that typifies the spring date more than a picnic			1
it 's sunny out , the birds are chirruping and the flowers are budding			1
the season practically beckons for an outdoor buffet			0
if a guy suggests a picnic , then i would already give him major points for having romantic inclinations			1
but there is a vast difference between consuming @entity111 's on a park bench than sharing a carefully prepared picnic basket			1
if he invited you out for a picnic but forgets the blanket , substitutes beer for bubbly and instead of a restaurant - worthy repast provides a @entity120 , then this guy is obviously not going to rate as any sort of gourmet @entity122			1
he is your typical @entity63 type			1
no doubt you will find that he has n't forgotten the cold brew : this type 's solution to everything , including global warming			1
if you want to spend your life fetching his beers and vacuuming under his feet then he may suit you but if you want a guy who is n't domestically challenged then i would keep on shopping for a man with a well - packed lunchbox			2
conversely , if your date packs a romantic meal for two : think shared nibblies , cold chicken , bubbly and even a salad , then this speaks volumes			1
this guy is someone who will invest in romance -- not just now but in the future			2
it also reveals that he has enough logistical skill to orchestrate dinner and enough motivation that you wo n't have to sandblast him off the couch to attend to culinary matters			2
this guy understands the power of food to forge moments			2
this goes double if he brought dessert			0
@entity159 the barbecue is where the culinary world and unbridled masculinity meet			1
i do n't think there is a stronger symbol of sexiness than a man at the helm of a bristling hot grill , especially when said man knows what he 's doing			1
i could easily flip for a guy who can flip a filet mignon			2
if this man can also hustle up some grilled veggies , a salad and a bottle of good wine then the date is in the bag , or at least in my book			2
the guy who ca n't wait to show you his skills behind a hot griddle , is your steak and two veg type			1
a dining traditionalist who might have varying degrees of gourmet sophistication but he is generally a provider and a protector			0
there is something incredibly primal that bespeaks to our origins as hunter - gatherers about the barbecue			2
and there is nothing like the open flame to get some sparks flying			0
if a guy shows competency at the hot coals , then no doubt he will be a keeper			1
on the converse , if you ca n't coax your guy away from his remote control to tend to the burning coals , then he may not only suffer the risk of vitamin d deficiency , but will likely not be much of a handyman or a helper around the house , and not to mention he will probably not even have a license to drive a hot plate			1
@entity222 or at home you would have to be @entity224 or an agoraphobe to want to dine at home all spring			0
if a guy only wants to stay indoors then it means one of two things : either he has silverfish in his wallet ( as he uses it so infrequently ) or he is allergic to sunlight			2
this guy may be a @entity236 who wants to eat you out of house and home , waiting like a @entity240 for you to feed him			2
even if a guy is a superstar chef , if he gives a kebab about courtship he will try and serenade you with at least a couple of alfresco restaurant meals			1
if a man tells you it is just as romantic staying home and eating take out while watching the television , then you know that he is just feeding you a bunch of baloney			0
if a guy does take you out , his restaurant and menu choice will reveal realms about him			1
it is possible to tell if he 's adventurous or conservative or somewhere in between			2
notice if he is a sharer or covetous and if he is controlling or carefree from his culinary conduct			2
more than that , what about his dining deportment ? some guys would n't pour your wine first if both your arms were in a sling			0
it 's easy to tell how solicitous he is or if he 's completely oblivious and would n't notice if you fell down a manhole			2
if you really listen and look with all your senses you can tell a guy 's key characteristics from his culinary style			1
most importantly , you can tell if he makes you salivate			0
if a guy does n't whet your appetite early on when he 's putting his best fork forward , it is unlikely he will later on			1
if you seek the delicious on a date , it is likely you will find a savory suitor .			0

@entity288 says you can tell a guy 's key characteristics from his culinary style
beer and burger on a park bench is the picnic style of @entity63 , not *sir* @entity122
a guy who shows competency over the barbecue 's hot coals is a keeper
even a superstar chef will take his date out for an *occasional* restaurant meal
