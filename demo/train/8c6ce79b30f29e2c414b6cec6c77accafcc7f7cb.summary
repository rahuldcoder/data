-- when you think of @entity4 , those never - ending sequences of looping motion , you 're more likely to associate them with lightly humorous viral content than a respectable art form			1
however , their hypnotic movement has been gaining favor with the artistic community , and now one of the most high profile museums in the world , @entity13 's @entity12 , has teamed up with @entity17 to explore their more reflective side			1
they gathered a roster of impressive judges , such as film director @entity21 , artists @entity22 , @entity24 and @entity25 , and @entity12 ceo @entity26 , for @entity27 , the first global competition for artists working with animated gifs			1
over 4,000 people from 52 countries entered their work , which fitted into six categories - landscape , lifestyle , action , people , night and urban			2
the top gong went to a @entity41 - based creative director @entity40 , whose mesmerizing @entity42 of a @entity44 window cleaner , shown above , draws the viewers in with its almost trance - inducing repetition			1
@entity25 , @entity47 photographer and film director , was attracted to the vibrancy of @entity40 's work : " it almost transcends the @entity42 medium by turning the soapy water into brushstrokes , so it seems more like creating a painting , " she explained			1
@entity40 herself said that choosing motion rather than still photography was crucial to capturing the rhythm of the window cleaner at work : " i was inspired by his brush strokes and the texture of the suds , " she said , " i watched him as if he were a performance artist -- his work temporary and only to be witnessed within a few seconds			1
i quickly became enamored with his efficient rhythm			0
surviving in @entity44 requires an elevated sense of efficiency and an innate hustle			0
" the work of other finalists -- @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 and @entity82 , highlighted the diverse and creative nature of a @entity42 as an art form			1
" there is incredible potential in this technology , and many photographers are now using @entity90 to create motion in their work " , says @entity12 's ceo and one of the judges @entity26			2
" you 're looking at an image that floats somewhere between a still photograph and film , it has elements of both but sometimes incorporated in an unexpected way , which makes it even more compelling , " @entity26 says			0
he added that the judging process was no different than when looking at other , more conventional , art : " what stood out for us were images which were arresting , and used the parameters of the @entity42 in an imaginative way			1
" artist and illustrator @entity108 , whose work has appeared in the @entity111 , the @entity112 and on @entity113 , initially started creating @entity90 to practice animation , but soon started making entire pieces for the format drawn by the chance to more eloquently express ideas he had inside his head			0
he says : " first and foremost i 'm conscious of it looping			0
its duration might be very short , sometimes only several frames , but in a loop there is the potential for its content to be endless			0
" moreover , @entity108 says that @entity128 helped him develop as an artist : " it most certainly has expanded the breadth of my work and its emotional impact			2
these days you need to work very hard to get your work to stand out , and a moving image really does wonders to get you noticed			0
" the exhibition will be featured online on @entity139 , a web gallery for emerging artists			0
too haute to handle - inside the world 's biggest furniture fair @entity146 artist creates fantasy worlds in her studio without @entity149 pimp my fish tank : this is the eerie , beautiful world of aquascaping			2

@entity12 has teamed up with @entity154 plus for the first @entity42 art award
the @entity27 went to @entity41 artist @entity40
artists are *increasingly* looking to @entity128 as bona - fide channels for self - expression
