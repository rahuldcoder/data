-- after almost 17 years in prison , this was it : this was @entity4			1
@entity6 's murder conviction had been overturned			1
carrying a small bag of her belongings , she walked out of prison as a free woman			2
only ex-prisoners can fully know the emotions that overtake someone during such a moment			2
it 's a mix of two feelings : joy -- for surviving their ordeal -- and fear about the challenges they surely will face in the outside world			1
for @entity22 's friend @entity24 , then in her late 70s , picking up @entity22 was also very emotional			1
" seeing her walk out was a really great joy , " @entity24 told @entity0 , recalling that day in 2002			1
" it was like a load was lifted off my shoulders			2
" the two women noticed a crowd of inmates and visitors had gathered to watch this magic moment			2
suddenly the inmates started waving goodbye			2
the sendoff was sort of a thank - you note			1
" @entity6 was very popular , " @entity24 said			1
@entity22 had used her education as a former law student to perform legal work for some of the inmates			0
@entity22 settled into @entity46 's passenger seat and @entity46 steered toward the exit			1
" we did a lap around the parking lot to wave back at them , " said @entity24			1
half an hour later , the two friends enjoyed a meal at an @entity55 restaurant , where @entity22 savored her first glass of wine since 1986			0
for someone sentenced to 32 years to life , it was a sweet victory following a hard - fought journey			1
" i 'm annoyed by injustice			0
profoundly annoyed , " @entity24 said			1
" this was clearly an injustice			0
" six suitcases of silver it all started in 1981 , when @entity69 -- disguised as a phone repairman -- entered the home of elderly coin collector @entity72 and his wife , @entity73 , in suburban @entity74 , @entity75			0
according to the @entity76 , @entity69 tied up the couple and was joined inside the house by his cousin @entity79			0
@entity72 was shot and killed			0
his wife was also shot , but survived			0
the cousins stole six suitcases of silver			0
after an anonymous phone tip accused @entity79 and @entity69 , police went on the hunt			0
" when officers attempted to find @entity79 , they encountered his wife , @entity89 , who told the officers that a woman named @entity6 planned the robbery , " appeals court documents said			1
@entity22 was a former law student in her 30s who 'd never been in trouble with the law			0
@entity79 's wife told police her husband had met @entity22 through a mutual friend , according to @entity22 's book , " @entity102			1
" police questioned @entity22 and held her without bail for about four months			0
she told police she was innocent and had never met @entity106 , and was released for lack of evidence			0
then , without warning a year later , police locked @entity22 away again without bail			0
@entity79 had suddenly told authorities that @entity22 was the crime 's mastermind			1
for a time , the death penalty loomed over @entity22 , but in 1983 the @entity75 @entity114 changed the rules regarding the execution of accomplices to murder			1
that ruling made @entity121 eligible for bail until her trial began , more than two years later			2
although @entity79 implicated @entity22 at the trial , his cousin @entity69 had testified at his separate trial that " @entity22 was not involved in the crime in any way and that he had never even met or heard of @entity22 , " according to court documents			0
but the jury believed @entity79 's story and convicted @entity22 on charges of murder , robbery and conspiracy			1
she was locked up at the @entity140 prison at @entity141			0
' she probably was n't a criminal ' it was n't until the early 1990s that @entity24 came to the rescue			1
she was visiting women inmates as a member of friends outside , one of many nonprofits across the nation that help inmates and their families cope with incarceration and transitioning to and from prison life			0
by supporting prisoner visits by friends and family members , friends outside says , it reduces stress among prisoners , preventing despair and unhealthy behavior			2
ride had already raised two daughters as a @entity75 housewife			0
one had grown up to become a @entity167 minister			0
the other , the late @entity46 , had become @entity169 's first woman astronaut			1
a nun who volunteered by visiting women in jail inspired @entity46 to learn more about why so many women who are victims of domestic abuse end up in prison			1
after her husband died , @entity46 began dedicating many of her days to visiting incarcerated women			1
" it interested me , " she said			0
@entity24 's younger daughter , the minister , understood			1
but it confused her astronaut daughter			2
" @entity46 could n't figure out why i was visiting prisons , " @entity24 said			1
compared to her work at @entity169 , she said , " it was a whole other world			0
" it was pure coincidence that @entity24 met @entity22 in prison			1
they hoped to work together to help women inmates who had suffered from domestic violence			0
" @entity6 had a good sense of humor and we just got along very well , " @entity24 remembered			1
after about a year of visits , " it dawned on me she probably was n't a criminal			0
so i asked her why she was there			0
" @entity22 told ride her story			0
ride was convinced @entity22 was innocent			0
she felt that she had to do something			0
despite @entity22 's objections , @entity46 started financing a private investigation and legal battle that eventually would win @entity22 's freedom			1
" i was willing to be stubborn and do what it takes , " @entity24 said			1
" of course when i started out i did n't know what it was going to cost			0
" the decade - long battle cost @entity46 about $ 100,000			1
she sold stocks to raise money for @entity22 's defense and had to pay taxes on that income , she said			2
@entity46 's private investigator , @entity217 , uncovered a damning piece of evidence : it was a letter that proved the prosecution 's star witness , @entity79 , had struck a deal			1
in exchange for leniency , @entity79 testified that @entity22 was the master planner of the home invasion and murder			2
@entity22 's prosecutor had never shared that letter with @entity22 's lawyers during the original trial			2
read the prosecutor 's letter in hopes of overturning the conviction , @entity22 's lawyers used this and two other letters to appeal to the @entity76			1
circuit judge @entity238 wrote that the letters " exposed @entity79 's motivation to lie and tended to show that he did lie			2
" the letters made @entity79 's testimony worthless and " without it , there was no case , " @entity238 wrote			1
@entity238 noted that one of the other documents discovered by @entity22 's team was a letter @entity79 " wrote to the prosecutor shortly after @entity22 's trial in which he emphasized that he ' lied ( his ) ass off on the stand ' for the government			2
" read the official transcript of @entity106 's letter read the opinion of the @entity76 eventually , prosecutors dismissed the charges against @entity22			1
but not before @entity22 had spent nearly two decades behind bars			0
housemates in 2008 , @entity263 prosecutors brought " prosecutorial misconduct " disciplinary charges against the prosecutor , @entity265			2
the court ruled @entity265 was " culpable of failing to disclose exculpatory evidence ( one letter ) to the defense ... " as a result , the court determined @entity265 should receive an " admonishment " â € ” which is considered neither discipline nor exoneration			0
read the @entity277 's decision now , a dozen years after her release , @entity22 and @entity46 are still supporting each other as the best of friends -- sharing @entity24 's home in @entity284 , @entity75			1
" all of @entity6 's relatives died while she was in prison , " @entity24 said			1
" so , when she got out , i offered her a place to stay			0
" they 've recently taken in a third housemate , a woman @entity22 befriended in prison			0
in the decade since her release , @entity22 has raised money to help women prisoners			2
she has founded an advocacy group , the @entity292			0
she also tells her story on the speaking circuit			0
at age 90 , @entity46 is n't stopping either			1
she 's still volunteering and visiting inmates			2
" prisoners are persons like the rest of us , and they 've made mistakes , " @entity24 said			1
" i think prisoners need friends on the outside			2
" for @entity22 , having that friend made all the difference in the world			0
ride says @entity308 should do more to support the nation 's prison population			2
