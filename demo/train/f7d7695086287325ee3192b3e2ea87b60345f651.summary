-- the mayor of a @entity3 college town wednesday welcomed a federal investigation into allegations that sexual assault and rape complaints were improperly handled			1
but @entity8 , mayor since 2006 , was also surprised when he was notified of the probe			2
" this is uncharted territory for us , " he told @entity0			1
the @entity12 announced tuesday it was launching a probe into allegations that up to 80 complaints of sexual assault over three years were not investigated thoroughly because of gender bias			1
of those , 11 cases involved students at the @entity21 -- at least two involving football players			1
" if justice has enough information that it believes an investigation is warranted , i 'm not going to question that , " @entity8 said			2
" clearly they have a responsibility to act on whatever complaints they are hearing			2
i think time will tell whether this was the right call or not			0
" assistant attorney general @entity32 of the @entity12 's @entity33 said the focus of the investigation was not on the number of reported allegations , but on the response			1
" our focus is on systemic issues ; that is , do the university and the law enforcement agencies have the necessary policies and practices in place to protect women in a comprehensive and integrated manner , " @entity32 said at a news conference tuesday			0
the @entity52 is coordinating with @entity54 officials , a spokesman told @entity0			0
@entity55 , @entity56 chief prosecutor , vehemently defended his office and the police officers involved in the investigations			1
" we adamantly deny that we have done any such thing , and we are deeply disturbed with the allegation that we have done so , " he told reporters			0
" i do not believe there is any reason to think that anyone at @entity21 is violating anyone 's constitutional rights , " he said			1
" we have not been told even in the most minimal fashion what it is we have allegedly done wrong			0
we are left to speculate what allegations are being made			0
" @entity32 defended the @entity54 investigation , saying that it was the only way to determine whether there has been any wrongdoing			2
" there are a lot of women in this community and a lot of stakeholders in this community who have strong concerns right now , " he said			0
in december , the @entity21 initiated its own investigation after allegations of a female student being gang - raped and possibly drugged by other students			1
the university hired @entity91 @entity90 to investigate , and she looked into nine alleged sexual assaults from september 2010 through december			2
@entity90 wrote in her report that the university has " a problem of sexual assault on and off campus			1
" that report triggered a preliminary review by the @entity12 , which resulted in the investigation			2
@entity8 said @entity32 notified him last thursday and met him and other officials involved tuesday morning before the announcement			2
at least 11 allegations of sexual assault involving students were reported in the last 18 months			1
and at least two of the allegations are said to involve football players on the @entity110 football team			0
" as to the university , we are investigating whether it responds promptly and effectively to allegations of sexual assault and harassment on campus and has taken the necessary steps to combat sexual violence , " @entity32 said			1
@entity21 president @entity120 said the school was " fully committed to cooperating and collaborating in this investigation			1
we have taken this matter extremely seriously from day one			0
" @entity8 said the @entity124 changed the way many people think about campus incidents			0
" @entity56 is no @entity128 , " he said			1
" but i think we are like a lot of places			0
our experience is not unique			0
" in march , the university dismissed football coach @entity133 and athletic director @entity134			0
@entity21 officials gave no specific reason -- only that it was time for new leadership			1
but students reacted , some with anger			0
@entity141 wrote on a university facebook page that the administration was to blame -- not the coach and the athletic director			0
" i 'm glad i 'm not a @entity146 anymore ! you hold @entity133 responsible for the sexual assaults on campus ? how despicable ! these men should be accountable for their own actions ! " @entity152 wrote that the university 's handling of sexual assaults on campus was a joke			2
" the way the @entity159 has handled the sexual assaults makes me ashamed to be a student			2
the level ( of ) incompetency is blatant and ludicrous , " he wrote on @entity162			0
@entity56 , a city of about 68,000 people in western @entity3 , is closely linked to the school			1
the @entity21 is the top employer in the city , and many local professionals are alumni			1
the city of @entity56 recently launched a campaign called " it 's @entity171 -- 911 " to encourage victims of sexual assault and rape to come forward			1
the city police website now has extensive information answering this question : " what will happen if i contact the @entity179 about being sexually assaulted ? " " i think there has been an expectation that as a community , we ramp up our efforts , " @entity8 said			0
" ultimately as mayor , my responsibility is to the broader public , its safety and welfare			0
