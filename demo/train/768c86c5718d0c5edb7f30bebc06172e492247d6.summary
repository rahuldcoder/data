@entity0 starts to 2015 for world number one @entity3 and his arch - rival @entity4 , a superb 64 from first round leader @entity5 and aces for @entity8 's @entity7 and @entity10 veteran @entity9			1
the first day of the @entity12 @entity11 was nothing but eventful as a top class field jostled for position at the top of the leader board			2
most eyes were on the partnership of @entity3 and his @entity21 rival @entity4 , teeing off early at @entity22 , and they did not disappoint , both carding five - under rounds of 67			1
but last year 's @entity25 champion @entity5 , a three - time winner at the venue , later upstaged them with a blistering eight - under 64 , which included 10 birdies , a personal best for him , he told the official @entity33 website			1
i 'm not sure if i have ever done it on a golf course , hit 10 birdies			2
i hit a lot of fairways , my irons were quite sharp and i putted well			0
it 's very difficult to shoot a bad score when you play like this			0
his late charge denied @entity47 's @entity46 ( 65 ) the honor of first day leadership , while there was a five - strong group on 66 , consisting of @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 and @entity56			0
@entity3 , looking to add to his two majors of last year in 2015 , made a slow start but a rally on his back nine , with five birdies in six holes , left him in a challenging position			1
there was no doubting the shots of the day , which came from young gun @entity7 and the 51 - year - old @entity9 , who aced the seventh and 15th holes respectively			1
@entity7 won a luxury car for his effort , while @entity71 was left to celebrate the eighth hole - in - one of his @entity33 career			2
it 's very nice when you make a hole in one			0
i 'm happy i finished level par today			0
