@entity0 -- decades ago , when the @entity4 was creating the predecessor to today 's @entity6 , one of the main goals was to create a communications system that could endure catastrophic disasters			1
the @entity6 was designed to have no central point of failure , allowing anyone to run his or her own communications channel			1
this was a system that could withstand a nuclear attack			0
today , the services built on top of that network have done a great job in enabling communications , perhaps none more dramatically than @entity21			1
during the days since the @entity25 earthquake , the popular social networking and microblogging service has been used for rescue efforts and for fundraising to help stabilize and rebuild the country			1
so it was big news when @entity21 was offline for 90 minutes wednesday morning			2
technology pundits promptly began hand - wringing -- the weaknesses of having a single point of failure to critical communications had been revealed again ! could we trust @entity21 ? did this mean the @entity38 could n't help us fulfill our most basic obligations to those in need ? not at all			1
there 's no reason that organizations or individuals who want to use the @entity38 to relay critical information have to rely on @entity21 or @entity48 or @entity49 or any other giant of the technology industry in the first place			1
we 've just forgotten a bit about how the @entity6 was supposed to work			2
rescue organizations and charities should simply be able to use the web sites they already have to deliver those messages			0
and was n't that the promise of the web in the first place ? were n't we going to stop relying on individual companies as gatekeepers for communication ? when blogs took off a few years ago , was n't it with the promise that we 'd all be able to share our voices without having to ask any company for permission ? why did we give that up ? maybe it 's because they made it look so easy			1
@entity21 has done an impressive job of growing to handle its enormous number of users , while keeping its service simple			1
the company has even shown a reassuring sensitivity to the civic and social obligations that come from running such a popular communication service			2
companies such as @entity48 and @entity49 have stepped up , too			0
their hearts appear to be in the right place , and they 're doing real work to help people communicate			0
but the @entity38 is bigger than any one site or any one social network			1
in my own work , i run a nonprofit that strives to connect government policymakers to the expertise of ordinary people using the @entity38			2
we 'll naturally make great use of @entity21 and @entity48 and all the other services , but it 'd be unforgivable to pick only one of them as a platform for civic engagement			2
telling people the only way to talk to the @entity106 is on @entity48 is like saying you can only call your senator by using a particular phone company			0
and that 's the key lesson to learn from @entity21 being down while people are depending on it for communication : some needs are too important to put in the hands of any single company			1
communicating in real time about emergency information is clearly one of them			0
fortunately there 's good news			0
smart inventors have already made cutting - edge technologies that let any site deliver messages with the same immediacy as @entity21 or @entity48			2
now the challenge is reminding all of the social institutions , media organizations and government agencies that they need to use their own communications infrastructure just as much as they participate in services such as @entity21 and @entity48			1
the reality is social networks come and go			1
ten years ago , otherwise - sensible companies were paying millions of dollars to @entity138 to buy " @entity138 keywords			2
" these were shortcuts to parts of the @entity138 service , which dominated @entity144 internet access at the time			2
in fact , many of us have allowed companies to become intermediaries to all our communications , whether it was @entity138 10 years ago or @entity48 today			0
but we do n't need to ask gateways for permission to publish			0
we can run our own web sites , at our own web addresses and keep control over how we communicate			0
think how ludicrous it would seem for someone to decide , say , to offer emergency services as an @entity138 keyword called " 911 " instead of having people just dial their phones ? that sounds absurd , but you can see advertisements today that essentially say " find us on @entity48 at @entity166 ! " now , @entity48 probably wo n't fade away entirely , like early networks such as @entity168			1
but those @entity48 addresses are just like @entity138 keywords 10 years earlier			0
and it is conceivable that the organizations and companies who communicate on @entity48 today may want to become more independent			0
whether due to emergency or just the everyday requirements of doing business , they ultimately will stop depending on a single point of contact for their communications			0
this is , after all , how the @entity38 was designed to work			1
we already see governments and civic organizations using the @entity38 as effectively as the best corporations and media			0
in the @entity144 , we have a @entity106 that 's got an @entity189 application and a @entity190 that 's asking us to define democracy by responding on @entity21			1
judging by how much technology has affected society already , those first experiments will soon evolve into full - fledged platforms for citizen participation and charitable action			0
and let 's hope they wo n't have to worry if any one web site goes down			0
because we 'll have a web of independent but connected communications systems , just as the @entity6 was always designed to be			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity205 .			0

@entity205 says @entity6 was designed to endure disasters , free up communication
dash : if @entity38 's goal is decentralization , why was @entity21 crash so disabling for many ?
dash reminds us that social networks come and go ; remember when @entity138 ruled ?
web users should take charge of their own communication efforts , @entity215 urges
