-- the first @entity1 got it right			0
in his farewell address , @entity3 warned of the " continual mischiefs of the spirit of party " making it the " interest and duty of a wise people to discourage and restrain it			1
" in other words , he cautioned against the dangers of political parties			1
@entity15 was keenly aware of the destructive nature of political parties and was concerned they would " enfeeble public administration			1
" with myriad affected agencies and thousands of furloughed federal workers , this is exactly where the country finds itself today			0
@entity15 is not typically held in the same intellectual esteem that some of his counterparts are -- @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity30 come to mind			1
however , @entity15 's farewell address is among the most prescient documents ever penned by a president			1
in it , he cautioned against the vengeful practices of political parties			1
to him , parties put their own interests above those of the country			0
he warned : " the alternate domination of one faction over another , sharpened by the spirit of revenge , natural to party dissension , which in different ages and countries has perpetrated the most horrid enormities , is itself a frightful despotism			0
" both parties today would likely level such charges against one another , while most @entity56 recognize that both parties share responsibility for the current situation			1
in addition to his concerns about political party mischief , he also warned of the dangers of accumulating debt			1
he argued that for a country to enjoy safety and strength , it should " cherish public credit			2
" running up debt would be tantamount to unethical behavior to future generations			0
tea party republicans have succeeded in heeding @entity15 's concern by bringing the eyes of the country squarely upon the issue of debt			1
however , the recalcitrance of the tea party @entity74 to compromise has also put the country at great risk , at least in @entity15 's eyes , given his dedication to maintaining @entity56 's credit			1
@entity15 was not a fan of taxation , but he abhorred debt even more			1
he wrote : " it is essential that you should practically bear in mind that towards the payment of debts there must be revenue ; that to have revenue there must be taxes ; that no taxes can be devised which are not more or less inconvenient and unpleasant			0
" @entity15 encouraged future generations to change policies they did not like by constitutional amendment or through the electoral process , rather than positioning their party to enjoy short - term benefits			1
the first president 's dislike for political parties still fits with the reality in which most @entity56 live today			1
political scientist @entity110 has argued that the divisions between @entity56 have been far overblown			1
he contends that the so - called culture wars are a myth			0
while the neat and tidy categories of red and blue states make for interesting media narratives , they fail to depict accurately the ideological beliefs of the citizenry			0
@entity110 points out that most @entity56 are not hard - core ideologues			1
on the whole , @entity56 are far more agreeable on most issues than the media depict			2
we love a good fight and as conflict tends to attract audiences , the media are quick to point to areas where conflict exists			0
yet agreement among citizens is the norm , rather than the exception			0
the effect of the polarized nation narrative is disillusionment for many @entity56 and undue influence for the more ideological in our midst			2
while more than $ 2.6 billion was spent in the 2012 presidential campaign , 40 % of @entity56 still chose to sit the election out			2
those who do participate typically are among the most ideological in the electorate			0
this tends to produce candidates who are in turn more ideologically oriented			0
when more ideological candidates are chosen in primaries , it leads to more ideological choices for voters			0
these choices likely do not reflect the preferences of the average citizen but instead more likely reflect the preferences among a party 's more ideological members			0
this cycle becomes increasingly embedded when congressional districts are drawn to support such a system			0
the end result is what we see happening in @entity15 today -- gridlock based upon both partisan and ideological whims			2
a common criticism is that both parties are putting their own interests above the interests of the @entity56			1
once again , @entity15 offers good advice to our current policymakers			2
" the name of @entity56 , which belongs to you in your national capacity , must always exalt the just pride of patriotism more than any appellation derived from local discriminations			2
with slight shades of difference , you have the same religion , manners , habits , and political principles			0
" for the sake of the country and the world economy , let us hope that our representatives begin to see themselves as @entity56 , rather than @entity189 and @entity74			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity193 .			0

@entity193 : shenanigans in @entity196 show wisdom of @entity3
@entity15 argued that political parties would seek to *perpetuate* themselves at all costs
tea party may share concern about debt , but its position *endangers* @entity56 credit , he says
@entity193 : most @entity56 are in the middle , not *sympathetic* to ideologues of the two parties
