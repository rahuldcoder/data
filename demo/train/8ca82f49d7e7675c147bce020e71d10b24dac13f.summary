-- the @entity3 could open the @entity4 as early as saturday , @entity2 gov. @entity1 said friday			1
the @entity5 has directed the @entity3 to operate the crucial spillway once river flows reach a certain trigger : 1.5 million cubic feet per second			1
projections indicate the tipping point could be hit as early as saturday evening , @entity1 has said			1
opening the spillway would lower anticipated cresting levels along the lower @entity13 and divert water from @entity15 and @entity16 but would flood much of low - lying south - central @entity2			1
seven parishes are expected to be affected by the opening , according to the @entity3			1
the @entity5 has advised a " slow opening , " and the flood would spread gradually over several days , the @entity3 said			1
the @entity4 has not been opened since 1973			1
@entity2 state and local officials braced for the possibility of major flooding in the @entity25 if , or when , federal authorities open the spillway north of @entity15			1
they advised residents to expect road closings			2
residents gawk at @entity13 's rise the @entity32 worked around the clock to construct a flood barrier in @entity35 , @entity2 , where the @entity25 was already 3.15 feet above flood stage , according to the @entity37			1
the strategy in @entity35 , officials say , is to reinforce the levees around the city			2
that 's where efforts were being focused friday , rather than on handing out sandbags to individual residents			2
" really , we 're just waiting , " said @entity47 , who has lived in @entity35 for 50 years			2
officials believe that the levees will protect the city from flooding , but some are taking preliminary precautions , she said			2
at @entity56 , where @entity47 works , people spent the day moving important documents such a baptismal , marriage and financial records to the second floor			2
" most people are getting their photographs together , things that you ca n't replace in case you have to go , " she said			2
a collective gasp as @entity2 town braces for flood meanwhile , in the @entity72 town of @entity73 , the river crested at 56.5 feet -- 12.5 feet above flood stage , according to the @entity37			1
the river 's slow pace has given emergency responders more time to prepare , forecasters said			1
but while the slow - moving water gives residents extra time to get ready , it also means that land could remain under water for some time			0
@entity1 urged southeastern @entity2 residents to evacuate			1
" now is the time to take action , " he said			0
the @entity88 said floodwaters could close the @entity13 to ships at the @entity16 port as early as monday morning			1
to help @entity16 , the @entity3 said friday that it will open 52 more bays at the @entity93 just north of the city , diverting water into @entity96			1
that will mean a total of 264 bays will be open in the 350 - bay spillway			1
stars talk about the flooding and response the @entity37 said that as of friday morning , the river was at 16.8 feet in @entity16 , just a fraction below flood stage			1
it is expected to crest may 23 at more than 19 feet			1
the @entity16 levees are built to withstand 20 feet , according to the weather service			0
upriver in @entity109 , @entity13 , police chief @entity110 said 600 residents had been evacuated as of thursday night			0
the river was expected to crest at 57.5 feet			1
flood stage at @entity109 , the level at which the river may begin flowing over its banks , is 43 feet			1
@entity110 said he expected higher water friday , with more homes affected			1
more than two dozen roads were closed and about 45 businesses will be closed by friday			0
homes that were built between the levee and the @entity13 were the first affected			0
" we estimate that every home built on the river side of the levee from @entity130 all the way to the @entity2 line is flooded , " said @entity124 , executive director of the @entity125			1
residents near @entity109 counted on a levee for protection			0
in addition to the mainline levee along the river , starting near @entity109 and extending northeast for more than 20 miles , a so - called backwater levee offers shelter			1
the backwater levee is designed to keep water from backing into the @entity143 delta and is designed lower than the mainline levee so that water can flow over it			0
that level is expected to be reached monday , said @entity148 , attorney for the @entity149			1
the backwater levee was being " armored " by a heavy plastic coating to prevent it from washing out , he said			0
nonetheless , 1.4 million acres in @entity13 , including 602,000 acres where crops are growing , could flood , said @entity153 of the state 's @entity154			1
across the @entity158 and lower @entity159 , floodwaters have covered about 3 million acres of farmland , eroding for many farmers what could have been a profitable year for corn , wheat , rice and cotton , officials said			0
in @entity72 , the @entity167 estimated that damage to the state 's agriculture could top more than $ 500 million as more than 1 million acres of cropland are under water			0
@entity124 talks about flood costs " it 's in about 10 feet of water , " @entity175 , @entity176 , farmer @entity174 said of his 440 acres of winter wheat , which was to be harvested in the coming month			1
other farmers in @entity13 , @entity182 , @entity176 and @entity72 rushed to salvage what wheat they could ahead of the rising water			0
as for corn , farmers who were able to get into the fields during a soggy planting season in late march and april are seeing their crops in some cases under several feet of water			0
some officials said thursday that spillover effects resulting from the flood could threaten other industries			2
that includes the possibility that the @entity199 3 nuclear power plant in @entity200 , @entity2 , could be closed , according to @entity0 affiliate @entity201			0
the @entity13 is expected to crest at 26.6 feet in @entity200 on may 23			2
if it reaches 27 feet , officials told @entity201 , the plant 's water intake system could shut down			0
@entity206 's @entity205 inspired by fans in flooded @entity130 @entity208 of @entity209 , the plant 's operator , told @entity201 that the threat to the intake system is not a matter of nuclear safety			0
however , @entity216 , a @entity217 official , said shutting down the plant would have a " domino effect " on local industries			0
" it would impact every industry along the river , " @entity216 said			2
" that 's just something that is n't easy for people to deal with , especially on a moment 's notice			0
" for residents in communities along the river , the damage has been far more devastating than can be measured in dollars and cents			2
@entity232 of @entity233 , @entity176 , told @entity0 affiliate @entity234 that the recent disaster marked the second time in one year that flooding took away nearly everything he had			0
@entity232 said that after a flood destroyed all of his furniture last year , he decided to move everything he owned into rented storage space			2
however , those belongings were destroyed when his storage unit was flooded several days ago			0
" they say bad luck comes in threes			0
i hope this is the end of it , " @entity232 told @entity234			0
the @entity233 resident said he lost a house to a fire in 2009			0
@entity232 said he is too preoccupied with taking care of his girlfriend , who is suffering from an infection that is damaging her liver , to look for new furniture			0
" we 'll do what we 've got to do and keep praying , " @entity232 said , holding back tears			0
@entity0 's @entity262 , @entity263 and @entity264 contributed to this report .			0
