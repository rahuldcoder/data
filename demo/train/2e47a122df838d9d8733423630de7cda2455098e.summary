@entity1 , @entity0 -- @entity0 's vice president , @entity3 , met with representatives of key opposition groups sunday and offered concessions -- including some that , if enacted , could bring dramatic change to the country			1
among the ideas agreed to by the two sides at the meeting , according to a report on state - run television , was a future end to the military emergency law that has been in place since president @entity17 came to power in 1981			1
the two sides also discussed steps to ensure free media and communication and plans to form a series of committees that would oversee changes aimed at bringing about a representative government			1
the opposition leaders who met with @entity3 do not represent all the demonstrators who have held mass protests over the past two weeks			1
one of the groups represented in the meeting was the @entity33 -- a group that , days ago , had said it would not negotiate until @entity17 left office			1
members of the liberal parties @entity37 and @entity38 have also engaged in talks with the newly appointed @entity3			2
after the meeting , @entity3 sat down with six young people who , according to state - run tv , were representing the " january 25 " movement , named after the date the protests began			1
but in @entity46 , some protesters slammed the idea that anyone representing them would meet with @entity3			1
" this is an insult to @entity40 , activists			0
who are they to speak on behalf of the revolution ? " asked @entity51			0
" i did not hear of any january 25 group when the revolution started , " added protester @entity55			0
" only now i am hearing these rumors			0
but i do n't know who they are because they definitely do not represent us			2
" some opposition figures also questioned the government 's sincerity in sunday 's meeting , saying the talks and suggestions of possible agreement might be tricks intended to end the demonstrations with @entity17 still in power and security forces situated to prevent them from restarting			1
@entity75 , the former head of the @entity76 who has returned as a major opposition figure , told @entity2 there was " a huge question of credibility " involving the government			1
" @entity17 is a symbol of an outgoing regime and people have no credibility , " @entity75 said			1
" if he does n't leave , you know , the regime would retrench and then come back , you know , with vengeance			1
" @entity89 and @entity90 , both with the @entity33 -- an opposition @entity92 umbrella group that is officially banned but tolerated in @entity0 -- said their party insisted that the closing memo after the meeting note that the two sides agreed to the importance of a peaceful transition by dissolving parliament and what the @entity33 calls the parliament 's " fraudulent " representation			1
the group also insisted on an investigation into the deadly clashes in @entity46 last week , and that those responsible be brought to justice in @entity0 courts , the @entity33 officials said			2
based on the meeting , the @entity33 expects that on march 1 , the two sides will take the next steps toward amendments in the constitution and reforming of the parliament , @entity89 and @entity90 said			0
@entity117 president @entity116 expressed his belief sunday that @entity0 can have an orderly transition and a representative government			1
he also downplayed the prospect of the @entity33 , which has voiced opposition to the @entity117 , ascending to power in @entity0 once its president , @entity17 , leaves office			1
" they do n't have majority support in @entity0 , but they are well organized , " @entity116 told @entity127 ' @entity126			1
" ( but ) there are a whole bunch of secular folks in @entity0 , there are a whole bunch of educators and civil society in @entity0 that want to come to the fore as well			2
" the statement on state - run tv said the two sides agreed to form a national committee to work on constitutional changes within a month			0
they also agreed to reject any foreign interference in @entity0 and form a committee from the legal authority and political groups that would work together to suggest needed changes , according to the statement			2
if the emergency laws in place for 30 years were to come to an end , it " would be a very significant move , " @entity150 , @entity0 's ambassador to the @entity117 , told @entity157 's " @entity156 " on sunday			1
" it has been a longstanding demand of most of the opposition and many segments of @entity0 society to guarantee that all political activity is undertaken under normal law and in the confines of the normal judiciary			2
so it would be a significant step and an indication of confidence that the political process is moving forward			0
" many protesters are calling for @entity17 's immediate ouster and for him to stand trial			1
his announcement last week that he planned to stay in office through september 's elections infuriated thousands and spurred further protests			0
but he also has vociferous supporters , who have clashed at times with anti-government demonstrators in recent days			0
the demonstrations sunday generally seemed peaceful , often taking on a festive atmosphere			0
among those taking part were members of @entity0 's @entity188 minority , who held a @entity189 in @entity46 paying tribute to those killed during clashes			2
@entity0 's population is 10 % @entity188 , a minority mostly made up of @entity195			2
warning shots were fired in @entity46 on sunday evening , as had happened other days , but the crowds stayed put			0
on the streets of @entity1 , there were increasing signs of normalcy returning			0
some shops reopened , traffic increased , and some banks opened for the first time since january 27			0
the nation 's central bank imposed restrictions on withdrawals by individuals , but not by companies , said @entity212 , manager of the @entity213			0
the justice minister announced that courts would reopen sunday and the government eased its daily curfew , making the hours 7 p.m. to 6 a.m. @entity0 prime minister @entity218 told @entity2 conditions sunday were " extremely better than yesterday			1
" he added , " hopefully tomorrow will get better			0
" @entity218 also said authorities have been told " not to bother " human rights activists and journalists , and that if there have been such problems , they are " not intended			0
" he reportedly called state - run @entity225 to say that a @entity227 executive missing for more than a week will be released monday			0
there was no explanation as to the whereabouts or condition of @entity232 , the executive			0
@entity17 will stay through september , @entity218 said			2
" a lot of points must be covered before he leaves , " he said , adding that the months ahead will make it easier for the government to " fulfill the mission " of preparing for new leadership			0
@entity117 secretary of state @entity239 spoke with @entity218 saturday night , according to a statement from her department , which is urging all @entity117 citizens to make every effort to leave the @entity245 country			2
during that meeting , she stressed that a " broad cross-section of political actors and civil society " should be part of the government 's transformation process , while also saying that harassment and detention of activists , journalists and others " must stop , " the statement said			2
sunday 's developments followed an announcement saturday that key members of the ruling @entity262 resigned from leadership positions , in the strongest gesture yet to placate angry @entity0			0
@entity17 's son , @entity265 , was among those who resigned from party posts , meaning that he is no longer eligible to take over from his father			0
his decision effectively put to rest a widespread belief that the embattled president was preparing for a dynastic handover			0
the @entity117 has been mounting pressure on @entity17 to step aside			1
on saturday , @entity276 , speaking at a security conference in @entity275 , said it is " important to follow the transition process announced by the @entity0 government , actually headed by vice president @entity3			1
" @entity116 , in phone calls with foreign leaders saturday , emphasized the importance of an " orderly , peaceful transition " to a government that is " responsive to the aspirations of the @entity0 people			1
" the diplomatic official who delivered a message from the @entity116 administration to @entity0 's leadership this week , however , said @entity17 " remains utterly critical in the days ahead as we sort our way toward the future " and must stay in office			1
changes are needed in @entity0 to pave the way for a smooth transition , and " the president must stay in office in order to steer those changes through , " said @entity302 , a former ambassador to @entity0			2
" it 's his opportunity to write his own legacy			0
" @entity117 officials emphasized that @entity302 was speaking for himself , as an expert on the region , and not for the @entity116 administration			1
@entity2 's @entity308 , @entity309 , @entity310 , @entity311 and @entity312 contributed to this report			0
