-- scientists look at a warming @entity2 and see a shift from white to green , as tundra gives way to new plant life			2
governments and corporations are also seeing green , as receding ice cover opens new shipping routes and opportunities to get at long - hidden natural resources			2
but the downside of those opportunities is the risk that the current pace of climate change could be sped up dramatically by the release of long - trapped methane gas in the region 's permafrost -- a risk to which a new study has attached an eye - popping price tag of $ 60 trillion in the next several decades , on top of previous estimates			1
that 's trillion , with a " t , " a figure rivaling the entire globe 's economic output in 2012			1
and it 's a tab that 's far more likely to be paid by people living in the latitudes far below the @entity35 , said @entity36 , a researcher at @entity37 in the @entity38			2
the developing nations of @entity40 and @entity41 face more risk of bigger storms , worse flooding and more intense droughts , she said			2
" it will have gains for some countries , " @entity36 told @entity0			2
" but as we can see , if 80 % of the impacts are going to be borne by developing regions , they 're not getting any of the benefits			0
" scientists have long worried that thawing the permafrost soil of the high northern latitudes could release large quantities of methane , a greenhouse gas far more potent than carbon dioxide			1
@entity61 and @entity62 scientists who study the region say methane has already started bubbling up from the floor of the @entity66 -- a region believed to hold to 50 billion tons of the gas			1
" everybody should be trying to pay attention to the shifts that are happening in the @entity2 , and not just leave that up to the @entity2 countries and not just to some crazy researchers that are in that beautiful white space , " @entity36 said			0
" we all need to pay attention to what 's happening , because the @entity2 is the canary in the coal mine			0
" using a @entity82 computer model , @entity36 and two scientists at @entity82 's @entity84 estimated what would happen if the store of methane currently locked into the @entity88 were released over a 10 - year period , without any other reductions in carbon emissions			1
the results , published wednesday in the scientific journal nature , indicated that global average temperatures could hit 2 degrees @entity95 ) over pre-industrial levels by 2035 -- 15 years earlier than currently predicted			2
even if other emissions were limited , the 2 - degree mark would still be reached by about 2040 , they wrote			0
the same model had previously computed the costs of climate change at $ 400 trillion by 2200			1
adding a decade - long rush of methane to the atmosphere would boost that by $ 60 trillion , mostly between 2050 and 2075 , said @entity107 , a modeling expert at @entity84 's @entity108			1
even a slower release , dampened by other cuts in emissions , could cost $ 37 trillion -- a figure that dwarfs the $ 100 billion that @entity114 estimates will be invested in the @entity2 over the next decade			1
the model includes the estimated effects of human health impacts and sea - level rise			0
richer countries are better able to adapt to those changing conditions , but developing countries " will suffer most of the extra impact , " @entity119 said			0
and while the brunt of the damage will be inflicted closer to the @entity128 , @entity125 nations are n't likely to escape unscathed			0
" mid-latitude economies such as those in @entity132 and the @entity61 could be threatened , for example , by a suggested link between sea - ice retreat and the strength and position of the jet stream , bringing extreme winter and spring weather , " the paper states			0
@entity84 ocean physicist @entity140 said receding sea ice cover in the @entity2 has allowed summer temperatures in the @entity66 to rise several degrees above freezing			0
" up to now , you 've had offshore permafrost , which is a relic of the last ice age			2
and that 's only been kept in place by the fact that the water is roundabout the freezing point , " @entity140 said			0
but as the water over it warms , that permafrost has been thawing -- " and what 's been released from it have been huge plumes of methane gas			1
" how much methane is being released is still under study , @entity140 said			1
but atmospheric methane levels rose about 1 % last year , and " we think that the source is primarily this offshore methane plume from the @entity163 sea , " he said			1
while the idea of long - term , human - generated climate change is a controversial notion politically , it 's accepted as fact by most researchers			0
global average temperatures are up about 1.5 degrees @entity172 ( 0.8 degrees @entity95 ) since the 1880s , according to @entity174			0
the concentration of heat - trapping carbon dioxide hit a concentration unseen since prehistoric times at the benchmark @entity179 in may , and scientists reported in november that the ice sheets covering @entity182 and @entity183 were losing mass at an accelerating rate			1
researchers ca n't pin any particular storm on climate change , but say the warming of the air and oceans " loads the dice " in favor of more extreme weather			2
@entity36 said she hopes putting a price tag on one facet of the issue will spur debate and new action			0
the authors urged the @entity201 to support development of new economic models and press world leaders " to consider the economic time bomb beyond short - term gains from shipping and extraction			1
" " we need to get our act together globally , and if we ca n't do it globally , we need to do it more regionally , " she said			0
and she said there may be opportunities for business , such as finding ways to capture the methane -- it 's natural gas , after all			1
" the story is not doom and gloom , " she said			1
" we 're hoping that we can use this to kick - start some innovative discussions			0
" @entity0 's @entity224 and @entity225 and @entity227 's @entity226 contributed to this report .			0

methane from @entity163 permafrost could speed warming , raise costs
economic models say that additional tab could hit $ 60 trillion
the gas is more potent than carbon dioxide in trapping heat
the study is a *warning* but " not doom and gloom , " author says
