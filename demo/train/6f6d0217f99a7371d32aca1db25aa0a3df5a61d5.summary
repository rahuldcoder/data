should a captive chimpanzee have the same rights as a " legal person " ? that 's the debate set to unfold after an activist group filed lawsuits on behalf of four chimpanzees , asking the @entity7 to grant them the " right to bodily liberty			1
" " when we go to court on behalf of the first chimpanzee plaintiffs , we 'll be asking judges to recognize , for the first time , that these cognitively complex , autonomous beings have the basic legal right to not be imprisoned , " said @entity10 , founder and president of the @entity12			1
according to the group , the four chimpanzees are all held in @entity21 : @entity22 , 26 , is living in a cage on a trailer lot in @entity25			1
@entity26 , 26 , formerly worked in the entertainment industry and is now living in @entity28 on private property , where he is caged			2
@entity30 and @entity31 , two young males , are owned by @entity33 and used in a locomotion research experiment in the @entity35 at @entity36 in @entity37			0
" not long ago , people generally agreed that human slaves could not be legal persons , but were simply the property of their owners , " @entity10 said			2
" we will assert , based on clear scientific evidence , that it 's time to take the next step and recognize that these nonhuman animals can not continue to be exploited as the property of their human ' owners			1
' " neither the owner of @entity22 nor the owner of @entity26 has responded to @entity52 's requests for comment			0
but @entity36 spokeswoman @entity54 said the university " has not seen any legal papers related to this matter and therefore is unable to comment			0
" morality : it 's not just for humans what is personhood ? " to be a ' legal person , ' one does n't need to be a human being or even a biological being			0
a corporation is a legal person , " wrote @entity66 , co-founder of the @entity67			0
even if the chimpanzees do n't understand what a lawsuit is , they benefit from being directly represented , she said			2
" we see that in children			0
they can be removed from an abusive home and be protected , even though the child might not be able to formulate those desires and the issues represented in the court of law , " @entity66 told @entity52			0
she added that @entity85 's parliament passed a resolution in 2008 that deemed great apes to be considered legal persons			0
so why not file suit on behalf of all animals ? " lawsuits have to address a real problem faced by an individual plaintiff			1
you can not sue on behalf of all animals everywhere , " @entity66 said			1
the lawsuits are asking for the four chimpanzees to be moved to a sanctuary " where they can live out their days with others of their kind in an environment as close to the wild as is possible in @entity104 , " the @entity12 said			1
the group said it plans to file more lawsuits across the country on behalf of captive animals " who are scientifically proven to be self aware and autonomous , " such as elephants , dolphins and whales			1
are we really different from animals ?			2

the @entity12 is filing suits on behalf of four captive chimpanzees
the owners of the four chimpanzees have not commented on the lawsuits
the lawsuits seek the animals ' " right to bodily liberty " and their *placement* in a sanctuary
the activist group says it plans to file more suits on behalf of elephants , dolphins and whales
