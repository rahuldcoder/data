@entity0 , @entity1 -- raddled by allegations of corruption and mismanagement by inept authorities , the @entity1 holiday island of @entity0 looked destined within a few years to have its once - beautiful beaches destroyed by the side - effects of mass tourism			1
since the 2004 tsunami made @entity0 even more of a household name around the world , tourism boosters have catered to sharply increasing numbers of visitors , with the island 's overwhelmed infrastructure deteriorating rapidly			1
@entity20 for many tourists became a sunbed on the beach where they could alternately loll and dip all day long and be serviced by locals bringing coconut juice or a cocktail , or perhaps even a delicious tiger prawn sandwich			0
such pleasurable indulgence proved exceedingly popular , and some beaches eventually succumbed each tourism high season under a colorful sea of sunbeds			2
along the foreshores at many beaches , illegal businesses sprang up and grew			1
beach clubs predominated , but a visitor could spend hours in a beauty salon on the sand or even buy a time - share property			0
a constant stream of vendors left tourists little time to snooze			0
@entity45 was evaporating , if it had n't already			0
then an odd and unexpected event happened			0
on may 22 , @entity1 @entity48 chief @entity47 assumed control of the country in a military coup following months of political deadlock between opposing sides			1
within 72 hours of taking control , soldiers were on the holiday island , bearing promises to save the beaches and berate the administrators accused of contributing to the island 's simultaneous ride and slide towards increased popularity and ruin			1
a few months on , and @entity0 continues to shake off the effects of decades of corruption that have been plaguing the island since the 1970s , when the first backpackers discovered the brilliance of the island 's gleaming west coast beaches and locals discovered a new source of income			1
until recently , tales of mafia - connected taxi drivers ruling @entity0 made regular headlines , whether it was for charging ridiculously high fares that were six times those of the capital , @entity82 , or forcing passengers to pay double -- not just for the trip to their destination , but also for the cabbie 's ride alone back to his base			1
in more extreme cases , drivers threatened violence against those who attempted to use alternative transportation options , as was reported in @entity93			0
soldiers on the beach today , all that is changing , due to the arrival of khaki and camouflage - clad soldiers			0
they tromped @entity101 , @entity0 's main west coast beach , enforcing the message that the hedonistic days of lazing on sunbeds were at an end , along with the vendors ' privateering ways			1
@entity108 was making a comeback			0
though many @entity112 countries have condemned @entity1 's latest coup , it may just have saved @entity0 from further decay -- also producing some useful social outcomes for similarly troubled holiday destinations in other parts of the country			1
all beaches in @entity1 are public space by law			1
the prohibition of private business operations on these public beaches is without exception , but has been ignored on @entity0 and some other tourism destinations			1
restaurants and beach clubs illegally encroached onto the beaches , right down to the high - water mark in some places , too many deriving private profits by ignoring the law and doing as they pleased			2
because @entity0 is 860 kilometers south of @entity82 , administrators posted by the central government seemed reluctant to interfere			1
@entity0 locals interpreted the concept of public beaches as meaning anyone could use them , so first they added sunbeds , then built thatch and bamboo bars on the shore fronts			1
over the years , entrepreneurs joined in , expanding the venues into large restaurants and beachclubs			2
some businesses grew to the water 's edge			2
there was no enforcement by authorities to force them off the beach			2
once the army took charge , though , local mayor @entity156 , of @entity157 , says he began receiving daily visits from officers in civilian clothes			2
he had no hesitation in admitting he eventually acted to save the beaches in his district out of fear			2
'' i was genuinely scared , '' @entity156 said			0
'' the @entity48 let me know i had to act			0
'' after decades of local '' law '' being applied , the @entity48 transformation came at great speed , within days of the may 22 coup			2
graders toppled beach clubs and restaurants , while the sunbeds and umbrellas were carted off in pickup trucks , banned forever			0
tourists on all @entity0 beaches now sit on towels			1
taxi clampdown what happened with the alleged bullying that taxi drivers were accused of , was even more remarkable			2
present - day @entity0 police commander major general @entity185 found the army to be perfect allies to conclude his covert months ' long investigation of the island 's '' mafia			1
'' in june , more than 100 taxi and tuk - tuk drivers were arrested and charged with alleged intimidation and extortion , according to police			0
local officials who allegedly sponsored the bullies were also arrested , police officials said			0
these include the mayor of @entity200 and his two deputies , plus the chief engineer and the senior officer , who remain on bail facing six charges apiece			0
when they appear in court , they 'll have the opportunity to enter their pleas			0
they have denied the charges			0
no court date has been set			0
anti-money laundering officers have conducted raids and more arrests have been promised			0
investigations into illegal activities at @entity0 airport have also been launched			1
the major general said : '' @entity0 was n't like this 15 years ago			1
as the power of the taxis grew , so did their greed and arrogance			0
the only laws they recognized were their own laws			0
'' administrators posted by @entity82 came and went on @entity0 periodically , perceiving all the problems , but powerless to seriously fix them			1
'' the administrators were all able to see what ailed @entity0 when they first arrived , '' major general @entity185 said			2
" but the longer they stayed , the more they integrated with the lawless locals and the more blind they became			0
'' the army takeover , though , brought to the island the one organization in @entity1 that is large enough to confront the taxi drivers and end corruption on , and abuse of , the beaches			1
the message from the army 's major general @entity245 on arrival was blunt but effective : '' i told the local authorities to do their jobs			1
the novel idea appears to be working			1
'' backhanders and corruption were previously considered the most efficient way for anyone to get anything done on @entity0 , according to experienced expat investors and some local businesspeople			1
investigations are now underway into resorts suspected of encroaching on national park land , led by the public - sector @entity262			0
villas dot the hillsides , well above height restrictions			0
on @entity0 , regulations stipulate constructions can be no higher than 80 meters above sea level			2
now , says major general @entity245 , complaints are being listened to and acted upon , without regard to the degree of influence @entity1 's resident '' big people '' have always had under civilian governments			1
'' enforce the law , '' the major general tells his officers , '' free from favor			0
" '' by november [ start of the tourism high season ] we will have made @entity0 safe , clean and appealing to everyone , '' he says			2
coup , what a difference it 's made here			0
more on phuket : @entity0 's coolest cafes and coffee shops more on phuket : insider guide to @entity0 @entity293 is journalist based in @entity0 and founder of the regional news and information site , he is a frequent contributor to @entity2 and a former @entity2 employee			1
he and fellow @entity299 journalist @entity298 face a continuing trial over criminal defamation and @entity303 charges brought by the @entity304 for re-publishing a 41 - word section from a @entity308 - winning report from @entity309 on the @entity311 boatpeople			0
the charges , strongly criticized by rights groups and mentioned in passing in the @entity315 's @entity314 , predate the military takeover in @entity1 .			1

the @entity1 military is cleaning up @entity0 's beaches
a *crackdown* on taxis is now underway in *response* to years of alleged illegal practices , abuse and misuse
" ' i told the local authorities to do their jobs . the novel idea appears to be working , " says military official
