a picture and audio posted online saturday purport to show that one of two @entity5 hostages held by @entity6 has been killed after a deadline for ransom passed			1
it also appears to relay the group 's new demand for the other 's freedom : a prisoner exchange			1
the static image , shown in a video file posted by a known @entity6 supporter , shows surviving @entity5 hostage @entity18 , alone , in handcuffs and dressed in orange , holding a photo of what appears to be beheaded compatriot @entity24			1
@entity5 prime minister @entity26 said sunday that the video is " highly credible			1
" @entity29 authorities said they had no reason to doubt its authenticity			1
@entity26 told @entity5 broadcaster @entity32 that the killing was " abominable " and " unforgivable , " demanding the immediate release of @entity36			1
@entity32 also reported comments from @entity39 's father			0
" i still do n't want to believe it , " @entity39 said , his face not shown in the report			0
" if i can see him again , i 'd like to hold him in my arms			0
" saturday 's posting came four days after an @entity6 video demanded that the @entity5 government pay $ 200 million within 72 hours for the two hostages ' release			1
in the video released saturday , the voice of a person claiming to be @entity18 says in @entity53 that @entity26 is to blame for @entity39 's death			1
" you were given a deadline , " he says			0
the voice then relays the apparent new demand from @entity6 -- the release of @entity60 , a woman arrested in @entity61 in 2005 on suspicion of trying to take part in an attack in which others killed dozens at @entity61 hotels			1
" they no longer want money , so you do n't need to worry about funding terrorists , " the voice says			0
" they are just demanding the release of their imprisoned sister @entity60			1
" @entity61 's @entity75 and @entity26 talked by phone on saturday , according @entity61 state news agency @entity77			1
the news agency did not detail what the two discussed beyond saying they " reviewed the latest developments in the @entity82			0
" president @entity83 condemned the purported murder of @entity39 by @entity6			1
in a @entity87 statement , the president expressed condolences to the people of @entity5 and said the @entity29 will work with its ally " to bring the perpetrators of these murders to justice and will continue to take decisive action to degrade and ultimately defeat " @entity6			1
@entity96 's prime minister @entity95 said @entity5 was right not to bow to the terrorists ' demand for ransom			1
" @entity96 strongly supports the firm stance prime minister @entity26 and his government have taken and we will continue to work with @entity5 and other partners around the world to promote peace and to build a safer , more secure future for our citizens , " @entity95 said in a statement			1
secretary of state @entity110 said the @entity29 is grieving with @entity39 's family			2
" @entity29 has known this pain and horror ourselves , and we stand with @entity5 not just in sadness , but in solidarity and strength , " he said in a statement			1
the @entity120 has seen saturday 's post , and the " intelligence community is working to confirm its authenticity , " @entity120 deputy spokesman @entity119 said			0
opinion : should nations pay @entity6 ransom ? @entity18 , 47 , and @entity39 , 42 , had gone to the @entity82 for different reasons , the former an experienced freelance journalist covering the conflict in @entity130 and @entity131 , and the latter an aspiring security contractor who felt at home in the war - torn region			1
they ended up in the hands of @entity6 in recent months			2
on tuesday , @entity6 released a photo showing a black - clad masked man standing over @entity36 and @entity39			1
the man made a demand : either @entity5 pay $ 200 million -- the same amount that @entity26 has proposed to help those affected by the @entity6 campaign , money his government says is for humanitarian rather than military purposes -- within 72 hours , or both men would die			1
@entity5 officials estimated that ultimatum expired at 2:50 p.m. friday , @entity153 time ( 12:50 a.m. et friday ) with no immediate news on the hostages			2
saturday 's video is dissimilar in some ways to last year 's @entity6 videos announcing the executions of @entity161 hostages			1
in five @entity6 videos last year -- announcing the beheadings of @entity29 journalists @entity165 and @entity167 , @entity96 aid worker @entity168 , @entity96 taxi driver @entity169 and @entity29 aid worker @entity170 -- a masked man is shown making a statement and sometimes putting a knife to the hostages ' necks			1
the videos then transition to a still photo of the victims ' severed heads			0
@entity180 , the woman named in the allegedly proposed swap for @entity36 , was arrested by @entity61 authorities more than nine years ago			1
in november 2005 , she said in a televised confession that she tried to take part in a string of terror attacks at @entity61 hotels that month that killed at least 57 people			2
she said her explosives failed to go off at a large wedding reception she was targeting , but that her husband 's explosives did go off there			0
@entity5 is n't part of the international military coalition that , for months , has been carrying out airstrikes against @entity6 targets in @entity130 and @entity131			1
its @entity201 constitution forbids the use of @entity5 military forces for any purpose besides self - defense			2
but @entity153 is allied with the @entity29 and others leading this military campaign			2
and @entity5 officials are offering help related to the ongoing unrest , though they insist those millions of dollars would go toward things like helping refugees , not killing @entity6 militants			1
in tuesday 's video demanding ransom , a masked man holding a knife stood over the kneeling @entity36 and @entity39 , and said that @entity26 " willingly volunteered to take part in this crusade " against @entity6			1
a spokesman for the terror group , according to @entity5 broadcaster @entity32 , would n't comment this week on whether his group has been in touch with the @entity5 government , something that officials in @entity153 had said they were trying to arrange			2
he said he was aware that @entity5 said it was n't involved militarily and called the @entity5 infidels for fighting with the coalition			2
@entity5 officials had said they would not yield to threats , but they would do everything they could to secure the hostages ' safe release			1
would that mean paying ransom ? officials were n't saying , at least directly , though @entity26 did call @entity6 ' demand " unacceptable " this week			2
leading @entity5 news organizations reported , citing unidentified government sources , that @entity18 's wife received an e-mail in december from someone demanding $ 8 million to $ 16 million for her husband 's return			1
the government was trying to confirm if that e-mail came from @entity6 , the reports said			2
if so , it could indicate the militant group was willing to accept a smaller ransom than the $ 200 million it had publicly demanded			0
@entity5 citizens have been taken hostage before			1
but what @entity5 has n't done is advertise whether it has ever paid ransom , lest it encourage more kidnappings in bad - guy fundraising schemes			2
it 's not clear whether paying would have mattered			0
@entity6 does n't have representatives or go - betweens everywhere who could solicit such a deal			2
nor does it have a reputation for morality and trustworthiness , so there 's no telling if it would have taken the money and killed anyway			0
and the fact the group publicly asked for $ 200 million , a figure well above other ransom demands , raised the prospect that it was never serious about negotiating			0
while there are certainly geopolitical implications , this story is also about two men and the families they 've left behind			0
as the apparent deadline approached , @entity18 's mother begged for her son 's life			2
" to all members of @entity6 , @entity18 is not the enemy of @entity6			1
please release him , " the mother , @entity284 , said friday			0
" ... i have been just crying for the last three days , filled with sadness			0
words fail to describe how i feel			0
@entity18 always has been a kind person ever since he was little			2
he was always saying , ' i want to save the lives of children in war zones			0
' " her son had been a journalist for years , contributing to @entity32 and other @entity5 news organizations			2
@entity18 covered big stories , hoping that by telling them , he could make a difference			2
that 's what spurred him to go to @entity6 - controlled territory in @entity131 , as he explained in an october video shot shortly before he ventured over the @entity302 border			1
" @entity131 people suffering three years and a half			0
it 's enough , " said @entity18 , 47			0
" so i would like to get the story of what @entity6 wants to do			0
" @entity308 , who had worked with @entity18 in @entity131 previously , says he warned him not to enter the @entity6 stronghold of @entity310			1
" i tell him it 's not safe for you , " @entity308 told @entity1			0
he said , according to @entity308 , " i am not @entity29 , i am not @entity96			0
" the aims and activities of @entity24 , a 42 - year - old unemployed widower , are murkier			0
he originally headed to the war - ravaged country early last year to gain combat and survival experience to bolster his plans to set up a private security company , said his friend @entity323			0
there , @entity39 met @entity18 , who gave him insights on how to survive there , @entity323 said			0
@entity18 also introduced him to rebel fighters , who are distinct from @entity6 , though both are fighting @entity131 president @entity330 's forces			1
some of the rebels talked about their need for ambulances to shuttle the wounded			0
that plea spurred @entity39 to start raising money for this cause after returning to @entity5 , according to @entity323			0
@entity323 said he advised his friend to focus on building up his private security company			0
before he went back to @entity131 in july -- a month before his reported capture -- @entity39 told his friend about his clear sense of purpose when he was in that tumultuous @entity82 nation , despite all its violence and other travails			0
" i felt a chill when he said , after returning home , ( that ) he felt in @entity131 he was really living a life , " @entity323 said			0
" he seems to have felt satisfaction being there and living together with the locals			0
" @entity1 's @entity352 , @entity353 , @entity354 , @entity355 and @entity356 contributed to this report .			0

@entity5 and @entity29 authorities say the video seems authentic
hostage @entity18 holds a photo of what appears to be beheaded compatriot @entity24
@entity6 is now demanding the release of a prisoner in @entity61 in exchange for @entity36
