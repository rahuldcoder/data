-- has @entity1 found the secret to eternal life ? the 78 - year - old completes 1,300 sit ups every day , follows a strict and mainly vegetarian diet and sleeps on average nine hours per night			1
during a remarkable competitive career spanning six decades , @entity1 won nine majors and 165 tournaments , adopting a grueling fitness and a practice regime to help underpin his game			1
" the more i practice the luckier i get , " was his most famous quote in reference to his unerring ability to hole shots from green side bunkers			0
@entity1 's forays on to a golf course are now confined to exhibitions -- " @entity20 and i were 10 - under for a better ball three weeks ago , " he says -- though he still regularly beats his age by several shots			1
" i was 12 - under par ( 18 holes in 66 shots ) recently , " added the @entity27 , who turns 79 in november			1
the day before this interview he 'd hit 100 practice shots , so it 's hardly surprising @entity1 is still able to average about 70 shots per round , which is the mark he achieved during his professional career on the @entity36 then @entity37 , one of the best of all time			1
nowadays @entity1 is driven by a different mission			1
" i have a passion to save lives , " he says , in reference to his desire to help confront the western world 's growing obesity and type 2 diabetes problem			1
" thirteen percent of the world is now obese , " @entity1 told @entity0 ahead of the @entity48 , which starts on thursday			1
" we talk about wars , the number of people dying from diabetes and cancer and heart attacks -- in comparison to the numbers killed in wars are insignificant , but nobody cares about health or exercise			2
" i do n't know why only one out of 20,000 people taka exercise and has a proper diet			0
how can governments allow it ? @entity72 's " @entity71 " -- a reference to his trademark all - black attire he wore on the fairways -- does n't expect the world to emulate his own punishing fitness regime , but he does have some simple tips to stay healthy			1
" my advice to fellow menfolk is every day to take you wife by the hand and go for a brisk 30 minutes walk , or get yourself a dog , they demand to be exercised ! " secondly do n't go for all these fad diets , just eat half the portion of food that you originally dished up			0
it will change your life			0
" the golf icon 's foundation , run by his son @entity92 -- @entity1 has six children and 22 grandchildren -- has raised over $ 50 million for underprivileged children in @entity27 and around the globe			1
it aims to improve educational outcomes and @entity1 is passionate that his message about health , fitness and diet reaches the younger audience globally			1
" we are not teaching children in school , that 's a great frustration for me			0
" player with @entity20 and legendary @entity111 @entity110 revolutionized golf in the early 1960s and under sports management guru @entity113 earned the label of the " @entity115 " as they dominated the majors and took the sport to a new television audience			2
@entity1 had an unquenchable thirst for victory , racking up more air miles than any athlete in history as he competed in tournaments around the world			1
he is particularly proud of his nine ' senior ' majors -- in competitions for golfers aged over 50 -- helping to raise the standard and profile of the events as he battled it out with the likes of @entity110 and @entity20 again			2
do n't dare tell @entity1 that golf is n't a physically demanding sport			2
the @entity27 recounts a story about basketball legend @entity137 , a low handicap golfer , telling him that 36 holes of golf in a day was pretty much as exhausting as playing in a match in the @entity141			1
a slight exaggeration perhaps , but judging by the number of nonagenarians who still inhabit the fairways the notion of @entity149 " -- the title of @entity1 's latest instructional offering -- might not be too far amiss			2
in keeping with his reputation for supreme physical fitness there is a clip which shows him -- donned in black golf wear -- running at maximum speed on a treadmill -- to the astonishment of the accompanying interviewer			0
watch : player in incredible running demonstration it 's a breathless demonstration that men several decades younger would fail to emulate but does back up @entity1 's central theme about a healthy life			2
" i tell you , walk 18 holes , it 's tremendous exercise and you can play golf for a lifetime , " he said			0
on the evidence of @entity1 's fitness -- a recent test showed he had a resting heart beat of 39 -- the @entity27 will be gracing the fairways of golf courses for many years to come			1
but he clearly wants to leave a legacy stretching beyond his sporting fame			0
" i said when i 'm a champion i 'm going to change people 's lives			0
" on my epitaph i want it to read : ' here was a man who contributed to society and saved lives			0
' " so for now he continues his punishing schedule of travel to meet burgeoning business commitments , such as golf course design , real estate , a winery and farm , as well as work for his foundation , which runs four high profile tournaments each year			0
" show me a busy man and i 'll show you someone who gets things done			0
" that work ethic was engrained in him from an early age , with his mother dying when he was just eight and his father having to travel away to earn a living in gold mining			0
" you must accept adversity with gratitude and never give up			0
you will overcome it , " said @entity1 .			2
