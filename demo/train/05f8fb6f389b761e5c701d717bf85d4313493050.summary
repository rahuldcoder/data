@entity0 -- @entity3 's family says it was making funeral plans for her last week as she lay stricken with @entity6 in @entity7 amid the disease 's deadliest recorded outbreak			1
after an experimental serum and a plane flight , she 's now the second human @entity6 patient on @entity13 soil , and her relatives think she has a fighting chance			1
a medical plane on tuesday flew @entity3 from @entity7 to @entity0 , where she was rushed to the same hospital where an @entity13 missionary colleague arrived days earlier			1
like her , he was sickened by the deadly hemorrhagic disease while on a team caring for @entity6 patients in @entity23			1
@entity3 was wheeled into @entity24 early tuesday afternoon on a gurney , wearing a white , full - body protective suit and escorted by two people wearing similar gear			1
there , she joins her fellow missionary dr. @entity30 , who became the first @entity6 patient ever in the @entity13 on saturday , for treatment in a special isolation unit			1
it is one of four of its kind in the @entity13 designed to optimize care for those with highly infectious diseases			1
" @entity3 is still very weak " but has shown signs of improvement , said @entity41 , president of @entity43 mission group @entity42 , with which @entity3 is affiliated			1
@entity3 's arrival contrasted with that of @entity30 , who wore a similar suit but walked into the hospital saturday with someone 's assistance			1
@entity3 , of @entity52 , and @entity30 , of @entity53 and @entity54 , were on a joint @entity55 caring for @entity6 patients last month when they became sick in @entity7			1
that is one of four @entity60 nations hit by an outbreak that the @entity62 believes has sickened 1,603 people and killed 887 of them			0
@entity3 's two sons expect to communicate with her soon , @entity41 said			1
the family was considering funeral arrangements for her just last week , days after she became sick , @entity65 said through @entity41			0
" yet we kept our faith , ( and ) now we have real reason to be hopeful , " @entity65 said in a statement read by @entity41			0
though there is no proven treatment or vaccine for @entity6 , @entity30 and @entity3 were recently given an experimental , @entity13 - manufactured drug in @entity7 while they were awaiting evacuation to the @entity13			1
both have since shown significant improvement , sources said on condition of anonymity			2
what the inside of the evacuation plane looks like the gruesome disease that can torment victims with profuse vomiting , uncontrollable bleeding and organ failure is ravaging @entity60			0
the outbreak started this year in @entity92 but also has affected @entity7 , @entity93 and @entity94			1
the flight and the experimental serum though @entity3 was weak , she had yogurt before her flight early saturday from @entity7 to the @entity13 , @entity41 said			1
she was taken to the plane by stretcher , but she stood up and entered the plane with assistance , he said			0
the experimental drug @entity104 , which @entity30 and @entity3 received despite the medication never being subjected to clinical trials , is getting a lot of attention			2
just last thursday , @entity30 's condition in @entity7 had deteriorated so badly that he called his wife to say goodbye			2
but three vials of @entity104 stored at subzero temperatures were flown into @entity7			2
@entity30 and @entity3 took the drug , and their conditions improved before they evacuated to the @entity13			1
9 questions about this new @entity6 drug the medicine is thought to work by preventing the virus from entering and infecting new cells			2
it 's a three - mouse monoclonal antibody -- meaning mice were exposed to fragments of the ebola virus , and the antibodies generated within the mice 's blood were harvested to create the medicine			0
while @entity30 and @entity3 's conditions improved after taking the drug , the serum should n't be viewed as a miracle cure , internist and gastroenterologist dr. @entity132 said			2
" let 's be cautious			0
we do n't even know really if this serum is working , " @entity132 said			0
" i 'm glad now that these patients were brought to a hospital where so many tests can be done , where they can see the response of their body to this serum			0
we do n't know if these patients are naturally getting better , or whether the serum is really doing something			0
" many have asked why the two @entity13 received the experimental drug when so many in @entity60 also have the virus			2
the @entity62 says it was not involved in the decision to treat @entity30 and @entity3			2
both patients had to give consent to receive the drug knowing it had never been tested in humans before			0
the process by which the medication was made available to the @entity13 patients may have fallen under the @entity165 's " compassionate use " regulation , which allows access to investigational drugs outside clinical trials			2
@entity13 ebola patient ' seems to be improving , ' @entity171 chief says how @entity6 spreads @entity6 does n't spread through the air or water			1
the disease spreads through contact with infected organs and bodily fluids such as blood , saliva and urine			0
historically , the odds have not been good			0
previous @entity6 outbreaks have had a fatality rate of 90 % , but the current outbreak in @entity60 has a rate of about 60 % , perhaps because of early treatment			2
there is no @entity165 - approved treatment for @entity6			2
@entity24 will use " supportive care " for its two @entity6 patients , unit supervisor dr. @entity190 said			0
that means carefully tracking a patient 's symptoms , vital signs and organ function and using blood transfusions and dialysis to keep patients stable			1
the @entity201 plans to begin testing an experimental @entity6 vaccine in people as early as september			0
tests on primates have been successful			0
in the 1990s , an @entity6 strain tied to monkeys -- @entity208 -- was found in the @entity13 , but no humans got sick from it , according to the @entity171			1
what is the risk of catching @entity6 on a plane ? concerns , testing spread outside @entity60 a man hospitalized in @entity217 was in strict isolation monday and tuesday , waiting to learn whether he has the disease			1
the patient became ill after recently traveling to @entity60 , @entity217 's @entity220 said			0
doctors were trying to confirm the cause of the man 's high fever and gastrointestinal symptoms			1
a specimen from the patient was delivered to the @entity171 in @entity0 ; testing typically is completed within 48 hours , the hospital said tuesday			0
but " odds are this is not @entity6 , " said dr. @entity231 , chief medical officer of the @entity232			0
" it 's much more likely that it 's a much more common condition			0
" the patient was stable monday night into tuesday and was in " good spirits , " the hospital said in a news release tuesday			0
@entity1 chief medical correspondent dr. @entity241 agrees			0
about half a dozen people have recently returned from @entity60 and gotten tested because of symptoms , but none of those cases has been confirmed as @entity6 , @entity241 said			1
doctors in @entity247 are also taking precautions as they treat a 40 - year - old man who recently returned from @entity93			1
the man was in critical condition tuesday with symptoms of a viral hemorrhagic fever , the @entity250 said			1
the source of his infection remains unknown , but @entity6 can not be ruled out , the ministry said			0
what to know about @entity6 experimental drug likely saved @entity6 patients @entity1 's @entity262 , @entity263 , @entity264 and @entity265 contributed to this report .			0
