-- a day after @entity2 was charged in the killing of 6 - year - old @entity4 , prosecutors now face the task of corroborating his confession and piecing together a mystery that 's confounded investigators for more than three decades			1
neighbors say suspect in @entity11 killing lived a quiet life with his family police say the 51 - year - old @entity17 resident confessed to strangling @entity18 and dumping his body in the trash near a @entity22 bodega where he worked as a teenage stock clerk in 1979			1
attorney @entity25 said @entity2 -- who is currently on suicide watch at @entity27 -- has not entered a plea due to a pending psychiatric evaluation			1
@entity25 says his client has a " long psychiatric history " including schizophrenia , bipolar disorder and hallucinations			2
@entity36 police commissioner @entity35 said earlier this week that authorities interviewed other employees of the store @entity2 worked at , but not him			1
" i ca n't tell you why , " @entity35 said			2
yet two law enforcement sources said @entity2 was in fact interviewed , albeit briefly			1
a third source said @entity2 not only talked to police , but he confessed -- though he was ruled out as a suspect , because his claims were n't believed			1
at a recent news conference announcing @entity2 ' arrest , @entity35 said @entity2 had no prior contact with the boy , and that investigators have not uncovered any forensic evidence linking @entity2 to the disappearance of the @entity54 , whose body still has not been found			1
former @entity57 resident @entity56 , who says he knew @entity2 at the time of @entity18 's disappearance , called the former stock clerk a " very strange guy			1
" " he was always by himself , " @entity56 recalled to @entity0 affiliate @entity61			0
" ( @entity62 ) never saw him with people			0
" opinion : missing children , perception vs. reality his pastor , @entity68 , described @entity2 as a " very quiet , unassuming , almost shy man , " attending church regularly with his wife and daughter , and sitting in the same seat almost every sunday			1
" so every sunday morning i had a conversation with him , " @entity68 told @entity0 saturday			0
" but the conversation was more or less a greeting			0
" one of the suspect 's sisters told the @entity80 that some family members claimed he had told them about the alleged murder in the early 1980s			2
" he confessed that he killed a little boy , " @entity84 told the @entity80 , saying that the suspect had moved to southern @entity17 shortly after @entity18 disappeared			2
but she said that he had never told her directly and never mentioned the boy 's name			2
@entity84 , according to the newspaper , said that her family had been torn over whether to inform authorities after the confession , but ultimately did not			0
" they did not want to get involved because it was a brother , " she told @entity94			0
@entity98 , whose 2009 book , " after @entity18 , " is widely considered the definitive account of the case , said saturday that she remains skeptical about the man 's confession			2
" i had never heard of @entity2 before this week , " she told @entity0			2
@entity11 investigation a 33 - year - long roller coaster ride @entity18 went missing on may 25 , 1979 , a block from his home in @entity22 after walking to a school bus alone for the first time			0
his disappearance helped spawn a national movement to raise awareness of missing children , including the then - novel approach of putting an image of the child 's face on thousands of milk cartons			0
the tipster whose information led to @entity2 's arrest contacted authorities last month after news coverage of their renewed search			1
that contact , at least in part , prompted investigators to question @entity2			2
police commissioner @entity35 said earlier this week described @entity2 's actions as a crime of opportunity and said the suspect was remorseful			1
" the detectives thought ( the confession ) was a feeling of relief on his part , " @entity35 said			0
after that confession , investigators spent two days talking to witnesses and looking for anyone who could discredit @entity2 and could n't find any , according to a source with knowledge of the case			1
manhattan district attorney @entity147 ultimately gave the green light to file murder charges against @entity2 based largely on his confession , even given the lack of physical evidence and questions about his mental state , the source said			1
the next major step in the legal process would be for a grand jury to hear prosecutors ' evidence against @entity2 for a potential indictment , after the defense waived its right to an expedited indictment on friday			1
it is not clear when this might happen			0
missing child case ' awakened @entity167 ' @entity18 was officially declared dead in 2001 as part of a lawsuit filed by his family against @entity171 , a drifter and convicted child molester acquainted with @entity18 's babysitter			0
a judge found @entity175 responsible for the boy 's death and ordered him to pay the family $ 2 million , money the @entity11 family has never received			0
although @entity171 was considered a key focus of the investigation for years , he has never been charged in the case			0
he is serving a 20 - year prison sentence in @entity185 for molesting another boy and is set to be released this year			0
@entity0 's @entity187 and @entity188 contributed to this report .			0

the commissioner say police did n't talk to @entity2 , yet sources say they did
one source says @entity2 even confessed , but his claims were n't believed
@entity2 is charged with murder , though there 's no physical evidence linking him
his attorney says no plea has been entered due to a pending psychiatric evaluation
