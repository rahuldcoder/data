-- days ahead of the one - year anniversary of the rollout of @entity4 , the @entity6 's health care exchange website that was originally plagued with numerous technical glitches , the @entity1 has released a report highlighting the impact of the law on hospital costs			1
@entity1 , which oversees the implementation of the @entity6 , said the report projects hospitals will save $ 5.7 billion in uncompensated care costs in 2014			1
uncompensated care costs are those incurred by the hospitals that wo n't be reimbursed			2
the report says $ 4.2 billion of the savings come from the 27 states -- plus @entity22 -- that implemented a @entity24 expansion as part of the health care act , with the additional $ 1.5 billion in savings spread across the states that opted out of the expansion			2
" hospitals have long been on the front lines of caring for the uninsured , who often can not pay the full cost of their care			0
today 's news is good for families , businesses and taxpayers alike , " said hhs secretary @entity36 before the report 's release			2
the number of hospital visits by patients who are uninsured has fallen , the report found , and the general hypothesis is that because of the increase in individuals with health care insurance , the instances of uninsured hospital trips are less frequent , and that will continue to be a trend			1
study : @entity6 gave 10 million @entity56 health insurance however , the report noted that " the extent of this reduction is an empirical question , " because there are a number of factors that will contribute to these costs , including " the extent to which newly insured individuals are able to meet the cost - sharing obligations imposed by their plans			1
" asked if these figures might encourage governors of states that originally opted against the expansion to revisit the option , @entity36 said the issue was a very individualized one			0
" the medicaid issue is retail , " she told reporters at a briefing on wednesday			0
" it is state by state			0
" but the issue is also political			0
of the 21 states that are not implementing the expansion , all but two of them -- @entity88 and @entity89 -- have @entity91 governors			0
@entity0 poll : is @entity6 working ? @entity36 expressed cautious optimism that the recent decision by @entity95 @entity96 gov. @entity95 to move forward with the @entity24 expansion could influence other @entity91 governors			1
" i think it 's true that people are influenced by people who are like them " she said in response to a question about whether @entity95 's decision might inspire others			0
" i think the more that we are able to attract conservative @entity91 governors , the more that those who have very strong feelings will perhaps listen			0
" according to numbers provided by @entity1 , a little over 10 million previously uninsured adults have gotten health care coverage since enrollment began last year			1
enrolling people in @entity6 who have no ' concept of insurance '			1
