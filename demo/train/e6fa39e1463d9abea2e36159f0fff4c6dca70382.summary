-- same - sex marriage has risen into the headlines again , as the @entity4 @entity3 mulls over whether or not it should weigh in on its constitutionality			1
but even sen. @entity6 , a likely contender for the @entity8 presidential nomination in 2016 , has suggested that it should not be a matter of federal concern			2
" it is a local issue and always has been , " he told an interviewer in @entity13 this past week			0
the tide on this issue seems , quite rapidly , to have shifted			0
even @entity17 -- who once stood uniformly against same - sex marriage -- have become more comfortable with the idea , and , one by one , mainstream churches have begun to reconsider it			1
one thinks back to those five little words @entity23 uttered in 2013 , spoken casually on a plane flight one evening when reporters asked about his attitude toward gays : " who am i to judge ? " these were astonishing words , with this @entity23 adopting a tone very different from that of his predecessor , who condemned homosexuality as an " intrinsic moral evil			1
" @entity23 was , of course , only echoing the words of @entity38 in @entity39 : " judge not , that ye be not judged			1
" that 's a powerful teaching , and the pontiff opened a door by his loving attitude , one that will not easily be closed			0
@entity46 has been coming quickly , in fact			0
only last june , one saw the powerful @entity49 officially change its position on same - sex marriage			1
by a vote of 429 - 174 , the elders of the church allowed clergy to marry gay couples in states where that is permissible by law			1
this vote cleared the way for same - sex marriages in some 10,000 churches in the @entity4			1
of course , the @entity64 ( to which i belong ) has been open to gay marriage ( and clergy , as well ) for a long time			1
in 2003 , it elected its first openly gay bishop , @entity68			0
this bold move created a schism , with a number of parishes leaving the main body of the @entity4 church			0
the worldwide @entity75 has indeed been roiled for more than a decade by the gay question , with many @entity78 parishes strongly in opposition to homosexuality			0
yet even in @entity82 , one of the most anti-gay of @entity78 nations , movement has occurred , as when in august that country 's @entity3 struck down a hideous law that sent gays to prison for life simply because of their sexual orientation			1
only a week ago , former president @entity92 -- a lifelong @entity93 and sunday school teacher -- spoke out for gay rights at a college in @entity96			2
" i never knew of any word or action of @entity38 that discriminated against anyone , " @entity92 said , provoking huge applause			1
he has , for some time , approved of civil ceremonies for gay people , although he maintains that each church has the right to make its own decision on same - sex marriage			1
" i 'm a baptist , " he said , " and i believe that each congregation is autonomous and can govern its own affairs			0
" where he stands personally , however , is not in doubt			0
much of the opposition to homosexuality among @entity17 over the centuries can be traced to the letters of @entity6 , the apostle , who also had difficulties with women -- although i do believe that , in context , @entity6 's attitudes are more complex than many assume			1
it 's important to remember , though , that he was raised an orthodox jew , a pharisee by training , and there was a strong prohibition against homosexual acts in many strains of @entity132 , as in @entity133 20:13			0
but @entity132 is a religion of many voices -- a quick glance at the @entity137 will make that obvious			2
nobody gets the last word on any issue of note			0
so what did @entity38 think about homosexuality -- or sexuality itself , for that matter ? in @entity148 , he offered his well - known teaching on marriage : " have you not read that the one who made them at the beginning made them male and female , and said , ' for this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife and the two shall become one flesh ' ? therefore , what @entity163 has joined together , let no one separate			1
' " this verse provided a basis for the traditional @entity168 bias against divorce -- a bias that has , necessarily , eased in the past century , when the facts on the ground simply demanded that a change in attitude occur			2
so many @entity17 were divorced that it became impossible to hold this line firmly			2
but it 's important to see these words of @entity38 about divorce in context , too , especially in the context of gays			1
in fact , @entity38 went on to comment on his own teaching when questioned further : " not everyone can accept this teaching , but only those to whom it is given			1
for there are eunuchs who have been so from birth , and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by others , and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven			0
let anyone accept this who can			2
" ( @entity148 19:11 - 12 ) now that 's complicated			2
so what is a eunuch ? in @entity209 , the word is eunochos , and it occurs eight times in the @entity209 scriptures			2
the word usually refers to castrated men , but it has many meanings , and one of them is " an ineffectual , powerless , or unmasculine man			0
" one recalls that @entity219 , in fact , had a male lover called @entity221 , who was described as a eunuch			0
so a eunuch was , in some instances , a gay man			0
if i read correctly what @entity38 says about eunuchs who " who have been so from birth , " he may well refer to this sort of person			1
certainly , there has been a lot of discussion of this topic among gay @entity17			0
i myself believe that @entity163 has a loving eye for all of his creation and judges harshly only those who choose to judge -- and condemn -- others			1
as the poet @entity244 put it beautifully : " everything that lives is holy			0
" the mainstream @entity168 churches seem to be moving in this direction , however slowly , and this is cause for celebration .			0

@entity250 : some religions comfortable with same - sex marriage ; others still struggle
he says @entity23 changed things for @entity257 when he said of gays , " who am i to judge ? "
scriptures ' meaning hard to divine in context of the day , @entity250 says
@entity38 ' words -- " let anyone accept this who can " -- seem in line with @entity23 ' view , he says
