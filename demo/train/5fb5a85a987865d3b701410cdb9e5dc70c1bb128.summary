-- a @entity2 study found women are more susceptible to guilt than men , and suggested that in the interests of equality , men should accept more guilt , women less			1
equality considered in such terms is a shibboleth			0
guilt is bad stuff ; it poisons life , saps resolution and crushes orgasmic potency			1
no psychologist ought to wish more guilt on anyone of any sex			2
dr. @entity23 , who led the study of 360 men and women carried out at the @entity27 and published in the @entity28 , says the research " highlights the need for educational practices and socializing agents to reduce the tendency towards anxious aggressive guilt in women , and to promote interpersonal sensitivity in men			1
" rescuing women from their burden of unwarranted guilt is going to require " educational practices and socializing agents " even more effective than the ones that have been relentlessly loading female humans with responsibility for other people 's behavior from their earliest childhood			1
guilt is one side of a nasty triangle ; the other two are shame and stigma			1
this grim coalition combines to inculpate women themselves of the crimes committed against them			1
opinion : why women trash successful women women feel more guilt than men , not because of some weird chromosomal issue but because they have a history of being blamed for other people 's behavior			1
you get hit , you must have annoyed someone ; you get raped , you must have excited someone ; your kid is a junkie , you must have brought him up wrong			0
any victim of sexual offenses who denounces the perpetrator should incur no shame			1
and to conceal the identity of a victim of a sexual offense , which is routine , is to endorse this profoundly misogynist prejudice			2
until women feel free to identify offenders without shame , the wounds inflicted on them will remain unhealed			1
for example , the @entity85 gang rape victim who was given the @entity86 by the @entity87 on @entity88 recently is known only by a collection of sobriquets , of which the popular favorite is " @entity93 , " or " @entity94			1
" no member of her family was present at the ceremony to hear @entity99 secretary of state @entity98 say fatuously that there would be " no more stigma against victims or survivors " when he had perpetuated that very stigma by refusing to reveal @entity93 's identity			2
why can we not know who @entity93 was ? because to be raped by a gang of drunken goondahs is to be dishonored			0
the stigma extends to her family , her community and even to her university			2
she has been honored because she did the decent thing			0
she is not around screaming for justice ; she is dead			0
her achievement is to be a victim			2
when the @entity121 administration hooked its wagon to the star of a sex martyr , it did little for the women who endure humiliation and stigma every day			1
@entity129 @entity128 has not been identified as a woman of courage , even though -- or perhaps because -- on march 26 , 2011 , she sought out the international media at the @entity133 in @entity134 to denounce the 15 @entity136 thugs who gang - raped her , beat her and pushed a @entity137 into her rectum			0
she found temporary asylum in @entity140 only to be handed back to the @entity129 ; she is now living in exile in the @entity99			2
her mistake was to survive			0
because she did not die for other people 's crimes , the offenses against her are now described as " alleged			2
" her credibility is shot			0
@entity128 : when rape is a tool of repression women live lives of continual apology			1
they are born and raised to take the blame for other people 's behavior			1
if they are treated without respect , they tell themselves that they have failed to earn respect			0
if their husbands do not fancy them , it is because they are unattractive			0
dirt and disorder in the family home is their fault , though they created none of it			0
in @entity177 's " @entity176 , " as @entity174 lies dying , strangled by her husband , @entity173 cries out , " oh who hath done this deed ? " and @entity174 answers , " nobody			0
" the moment is extreme , but the phenomenon happens daily			0
women all over the world , across cultures , are excusing the violence that men mete out to them , often , most tragically , interpreting acts of pure brutality as evidence of love			1
according to the @entity195 , two women die at the hands of their male partners every week			2
the police ca n't help them if they wo n't leave a violent partner ; they choose to stay and die			0
until we have unraveled this conundrum , we will never understand women			0
until women themselves reject stigma and refuse to feel shame for the way others treat them , they have no hope of achieving full human stature			1
@entity99 president @entity212 described the four essential freedoms as freedom of speech , freedom of worship , freedom from want and freedom from fear			0
the fifth essential freedom to be fought for is freedom from shame			0
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity222 .			1

@entity222 : study found women feel the poison of guilt more than men
@entity222 : women are raised to take the blame for crimes against them , she says
when a rape victim is *unnamed* , she says , it supports the stigmatization of rape
@entity222 : women must reject stigma and refuse to feel shame for the way others treat them
