-- as @entity4 leaders gather in @entity5 , @entity6 , for this week 's @entity7 , the @entity2 army is taking a pounding from @entity10 - supported rebel fighters in the country 's east and south			1
the central question now confronting president @entity15 and colleagues is whether to supply @entity17 with heavy arms			1
so far , @entity15 and @entity20 chancellor @entity19 , the two key decision makers , have been reluctant			0
but with @entity2 forces reeling before what many are calling an overt @entity10 invasion , pressure is growing on them to reconsider			1
already @entity7 has announced plans to strengthen the defense of its frontline members in the @entity31 and @entity32			0
the alliance is planning to create a rapid reaction force , made up of 4,000 troops , to respond within hours to any future @entity10 incursion			1
whether that will be enough to deter president @entity39 , it will not help @entity40 , which is not a @entity7 member			1
under fierce attack from the rebels , supported now by up to 2,000 @entity10 troops , the @entity2 army has been reduced in recent days from seeking victory to merely trying to avoid defeat			2
to fight back , it needs anti-tank and anti-aircraft weapons , drones , spare parts , fuel -- and , most of all , intelligence and strategic advice from @entity4 military planners			0
should @entity7 -- or just the @entity57 -- oblige ? there are powerful arguments on both sides			1
equipping @entity17 with greater firepower might well provoke an escalation from @entity10 , whose forces grossly outnumber those of @entity40			1
to send more arms into a war zone is cynical if it will merely increase the scale of killing without any realistic prospect of ending the conflict			0
both @entity15 and @entity19 believe their current strategy of graduated economic sanctions will bear fruit in the longer run			0
unwilling to contemplate direct military involvement , they worry about getting dragged in inadvertently			0
yet to refuse the kind of military support that might enable @entity17 to reclaim its eastern territories would allow @entity39 's violation of the principle of state sovereignty to stand , at least for now			1
the international order depends upon respect for borders and a rejection of territorial conquest			0
@entity92 is surely monitoring events in @entity40 closely as it sizes up the @entity94			2
@entity95 may take comfort from the @entity98 's divisions as it negotiates over its nuclear program			0
@entity100 may be tempted to disregard @entity57 warnings			0
and if @entity39 perceives his @entity2 gambit to have worked , this may embolden him to push further			2
the other day , he appeared to boast to @entity105 officials that he " could take @entity17 in two weeks			2
" four times in a row , @entity39 has upped the ante in the face of @entity4 rhetorical and economic pressure			2
he sent special forces into @entity113 , then annexed the region to @entity10 , then engineered the rebellion in the east , then , more recently , dramatically increased military support			1
in between -- and especially whenever the @entity98 looked ready to act -- he floated " peace proposals " and " ceasefires " that have always come to nothing			0
a new " @entity123 " revealed on wednesday may or may not turn out to be something more serious			0
with more than 750,000 active - duty forces , @entity125 's military superiority over @entity17 is obvious			1
but would @entity39 choose to escalate if the rebels faced a better - armed adversary ? of course , a complete defeat of @entity125 's proxies would be embarrassing			1
but more direct @entity10 involvement would also carry domestic costs			2
at present , @entity39 's ratings at home are off the charts -- 84 % approved of his actions in the latest independent , @entity125 - based @entity139 poll			1
yet , at the same time , the surveys show the @entity142 euphoria to be fading and doubts about military engagement growing			0
since march , the percentage of @entity10 who say they would " support the @entity10 leadership in the situation of an open military conflict between @entity10 and @entity40 " has fallen from 74 % to 41 %			1
that 's less than the 43 % who now say they would not support this			0
the share favoring the incorporation of eastern @entity40 into @entity10 has fallen from 35 % in april to 21 % in mid-august			1
@entity10 remain delighted by the annexation of @entity113			2
but the proportion that say they are ready to bear at least some of the economic cost associated with the territory 's incorporation has fallen from 59 % in march to 50 % today			0
fighting a disorganized and poorly equipped adversary , @entity39 can have it both ways			2
he can keep support to the separatist rebels relatively limited and covert , while denying to the public back home that @entity10 is involved at all			2
all this is not to say that @entity39 would stand by if the @entity98 sent arms to @entity17			1
he may feel strong enough to disregard the hints of growing public anxiety			0
nor is it clear that additional weapons would turn the tide			0
to win the war , @entity2 president @entity176 needs to build a more effective state , introduce economic reforms and offer potentially loyal citizens of @entity40 a comprehensive deal that recognizes their minority rights and -- while excluding the thugs and @entity10 agents that have streamed across the border -- gives local @entity2 some real autonomy			1
for the leaders in @entity5 , this will remain a tough call			0
but the argument for arming @entity17 is stronger than it has ever been			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity194 .			0

@entity194 : @entity40 is much weaker than @entity10 , needs aid to hold its own
he says there are powerful arguments on both sides about whether to send military aid
aid could lead to @entity10 escalation but doing nothing would *condone* @entity39 's actions , he says
@entity194 : argument for arming @entity17 is stronger than it has ever been
