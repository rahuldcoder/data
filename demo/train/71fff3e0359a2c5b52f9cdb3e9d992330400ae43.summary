@entity0 -- @entity2 's most precious present this @entity3 wo n't be under her tree , and it did n't come from a store			1
this holiday , she said , she got her life back			0
the @entity8 , @entity9 , resident learned nine years ago she had kidney disease			2
one of her kidneys began to deteriorate , and she had to begin regular dialysis			0
because she could n't find a family match , her former colleague and friend , @entity17 , offered to donate one of his kidneys			2
problem was , @entity22 and @entity17 did n't match either			2
but @entity22 's doctor suggested they look into the paired kidney donation program at @entity26 in @entity0 she became part a massive mix - and - match transplant effort in the @entity29 , involving more than a dozen kidneys			1
watch more on the 26 - person transplant " when i tell people how i got my kidney , they say , ' wow , ' " said @entity22			1
" i 'm amazed myself			0
" as of this week , 84,000 people are waiting for a kidney donation , according to the @entity36 , which keeps an updated list			2
according to the @entity40 , many people who need kidney transplants have family members or friends willing to give a kidney , only to find out that their blood and tissue are not compatible with their intended recipient			1
but now through these so - called paired kidney donation programs , offered by hospitals that specialize in transplantation , people who otherwise would remain ill or on dialysis are getting a new lease on life			1
in paired kidney donation , one incompatible donor / recipient pair , such as @entity22 and @entity17 , are matched with another pair in the same situation , so that the donor of the first kidney gives to the recipient of the second , and vice versa			1
in larger kidney exchanges , donors and recipients are mixed and matched , giving more people the chance to obtain a new kidney			1
according to the @entity70 and the @entity71 , paired donation will one day allow for an additional 3,000 living donor kidney transplants a year in the @entity29 after they learned what was involved , @entity22 and @entity17 put themselves on a list			1
" he just signed , " said @entity22			2
" i said , ' what are you doing ? are you sure ? ' and he shook his head yes			0
" " it was kind of jumping out there on faith , " @entity17 said			0
" and lo and behold , it 's working out for her			2
" three weeks later , @entity22 and @entity17 were told they would be part of the 26 - person transplant effort , coordinated through @entity90 and @entity26			1
believed to be one of the largest such procedures ever completed in the @entity29 , there would be 13 donors and 13 recipients			2
@entity22 was elated , because she would no longer need dialysis			2
" it happened so fast			0
i had been on the transplant list for so long , over a year and a half , " she explained			0
" and then all of a sudden , i was getting a kidney			0
" that kidney would come from a @entity0 businesswoman by the name of @entity106			1
@entity106 was in a similar situation			2
she was willing to give a kidney to her best friend 's husband , @entity109			1
but they did n't match			0
@entity106 , along with @entity112 , joined a list at @entity90			1
" if you can do something that is not life - threatening to you , that could save someone else 's life , why would you say no ? " @entity106 asked			1
by melding their donor and recipient lists together , @entity90 and @entity26 could mix and match patients			1
the procedure would take six days to complete with doctors performing surgery on two to three patients a day			0
dr. @entity125 , head of the kidney - pancreas transplantation unit at @entity90 , oversaw the project			2
" all the recipients had donors that they did n't match with , " he said			0
" and they had to receive a transplant via a paired kidney exchange			0
" on the last day of surgeries , @entity106 's kidney was removed , cleaned and readied to be transported to @entity26 , where @entity22 's doctors were waiting to implant the new organ			1
@entity109 had already received his transplant			0
@entity17 ' kidney , removed the same day @entity22 received hers , was sent to a patient at @entity90			1
by criss - crossing patients , 13 people , 11 of whom were minorities , were able to renew their lives			1
according the @entity29 @entity146 ' @entity145 , the rate of organ donation in minority communities does not keep pace with the number needing transplants			0
many times , it 's because of fear of the medical community or mistrust of the system			0
health experts say that 's unfortunate			0
a report by @entity146 noted , " although minorities donate in proportion to their share of the population , their need for transplants is much greater			0
" @entity168 , the report said , make up about 13 percent of the population and about 12 percent of donors , but they represent 23 percent of the patients on the kidney waiting list			1
citing the critical need , @entity125 is urging minorities to join the exchange programs			0
" it 's very important for minorities to receive living transplants , because their outcome with deceased donor transplants are not as good as everyone else , " @entity125 said			1
additionally , years of dialysis can lead to a build - up of antibodies , which can cause rejection of the new organ			0
that 's especially true for minorities , because they tend to stay on dialysis much longer			2
patients who have this build - up of antibodies receive a blood cleansing procedure called plasmapheresis to trick their bodies into accepting the kidney without rejection			1
on monday morning , @entity106 visited @entity2 in her hospital room at @entity26			1
along with @entity17 and @entity2 's mother @entity199 , they all laughed and hugged			1
at one point , it got pretty emotional			0
" this is too much for me , " said @entity2 , as she wiped away her tears			2
" i did this for my son , so i could be there for him			0
but these people made it possible			0
" " @entity106 has given me her kidney			1
i ca n't thank her enough and as for @entity17 -- he 's my @entity210 , " @entity22 said			1
" he 's saving my life , because [ without him ] i would n't be able to be in this circle			0
at the same time , he 's saving somebody else 's life			0

new : @entity2 met her donor , @entity106 , on monday
@entity22 joined program that connects patients with willing donors
@entity22 's friend donated kidney to compatible recipient ; she got *stranger* 's kidney
11 of 13 people in the huge kidney criss - cross were minorities
