-- when 4 - year - old @entity2 was reluctantly sent off to spend the summer with his mother late last month , he was in effect being given a death sentence			1
the child never had a chance			2
he was dead within two weeks of arriving at the apartment in @entity9 , @entity10 , where his mother lived with her fiancé			2
what could have been done to save him ? " i do n't have a good answer for you , " @entity9 police lt. @entity14 , one of many law enforcement officers in @entity17 , @entity10 , who are grieving for the boy who lived among them so briefly , told me			1
the facts of what happened to @entity2 speak for themselves : he was living with his father , @entity24 , in @entity25 , @entity26			1
@entity27 and his estranged wife , @entity28 , were involved in divorce proceedings			0
the divorce was being adjudicated in @entity31 , where they had lived before she moved west			0
@entity35 , in a divorce court filing last november , warned of his fears			0
his estranged wife was " unstable , " he wrote to the court : " the mother has abandoned the child and i 'm afraid the mother will come and take him and i 'll never see him again			2
" but the judge in the divorce case , @entity44 , told @entity45 that she never read the filing			0
judge @entity44 said that @entity2 's parents had worked out a settlement , including shared custody , and that the finalization of their divorce last month was " cut and dried			1
" part of the decree was that @entity2 would live with his dad during the school year , and with his mother during the summer			1
the child reportedly did not want to go to @entity10 with her			0
" i did not want him to go , and he did n't want to go at all , " @entity35 told the @entity59			0
" he kept telling me he did n't want to go			0
" but in late april , the divorce agreement newly in effect , the boy was put on a plane to fly to @entity10 with his mother			1
what allegedly happened next is described in affidavits prepared by the @entity68 : @entity2 , his mother and her fiancé , @entity70 , began living in their @entity9 home			1
on may 5 , @entity70 , 31 , took the 4 - year - old child into a bedroom and began slapping and hitting him on the face and head , police said			1
@entity2 's face began to swell			1
police said his mother did not alert anyone or seek medical attention for her son			1
on may 6 , the couple went to the county courthouse in @entity85 , @entity10 , to get married			0
they did not bring @entity2 with them			1
the reason , according to police , was that they were " afraid to take him out in public with the swelling and bruising to his face , " because they thought that if anyone saw @entity2 's injuries , they would call authorities			1
so , police detectives said , they removed the inside doorknob of the bedroom where they left @entity2 , so he could not get out			1
for the next three days , police said , @entity2 was vomiting , was lethargic , had a fever , and was not able to eat			1
his symptoms were consistent with a possible brain injury			0
instead of trying to help the child , @entity70 engaged in " a systematic and progressively more violent pattern of abuse			0
" but no one knew			0
@entity35 had called his son every day after the child had been sent to @entity10 , but he told the @entity59 that beginning on may 5 , his former wife began to make excuses on the phone for why the boy could not talk to him			2
" i never did get a call back , " @entity27 told the paper			0
on may 7 , police said , @entity120 returned home from shopping to find that @entity2 had been scalded on his feet , legs and buttocks			1
@entity70 said the boy had burned himself in the bathtub			2
@entity35 continued to try to call his son , but to no avail			0
on may 9 -- @entity129 -- @entity2 was found dead in his bed			1

" the couple , according to police , wrapped garbage bags around the child 's body and drove to @entity141			1
police said @entity70 took a hammer to @entity2 's face and teeth , in an effort to make him unrecognizable should anyone ever find him			1
the boy was then buried			2
late the next night , @entity120 reported the child missing			0
she told the @entity9 police that @entity2 had walked away from home			1
some 40 officers , in foul weather , searched for the child			0
but before long the @entity156 ' story began to fall apart			2
late on the afternoon of may 11 , officers digging in the mud recovered his body			2
@entity70 and @entity120 are being held in the @entity161			0
