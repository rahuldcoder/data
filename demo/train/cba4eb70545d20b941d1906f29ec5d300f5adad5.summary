during the height of the months - long protests in @entity3 last summer , police said demonstrators could protest all they want -- as long as they stayed home after dark			1
the reasoning back then : troublemakers from outside the city come in to create chaos under cover of darkness , making the police 's job of maintaining order difficult			2
and yet , even though a grand jury reached a decision on whether to indict officer @entity19 by monday afternoon , the decision was n't publicized until hours later -- around 8 p.m. in @entity20			0
so why did officials wait so long ? how prosecutor defended grand jury 's decision @entity20 gov. @entity25 was asked by reporters about the nighttime announcement			1
@entity25 said the decision was made solely by @entity30 prosecuting attorney @entity29			0
" we coordinated with law enforcement , gave schools time to get their children home and in a safe place , gave businesses time to make a decision on their employees ' safety , gave media time to set up , prepared our statement and made the announcement , " @entity31 , executive assistant to @entity29 , said in a statement			1
@entity48 senior legal analyst @entity47 said @entity29 's decision was " foolish and dangerous			1
" " i find this a completely bizarre decision to do this at night , " @entity47 said			1
" here 's the thing about that time of night : it 's dark			2
anyone -- anyone ! -- should have known that the decision in the @entity58 case would have been controversial			0
crowd control is always more difficult in the dark			1
" @entity48 legal analyst @entity61 noted the announcement was supposed to be made at 8 p.m. et but was rescheduled for 9 et. " why would you be moving it another hour ? i think the only reason can be that they do n't have their security forces in place , " he said			1
initially , prosecutors were expected to give law enforcement 48 hours ' notice from when the grand jury made its decision to when the announcement was made			0
but that clearly did n't happen monday , since the decision and the announcement came on the same day			0
community activist @entity78 anticipated @entity29 's explanation , saying he could understand if officials wanted to get schoolchildren home and businesses closed first			1
" but he could have easily made this ( announcement tuesday ) morning , " @entity78 said at the time			0
also , chilly nighttime weather can sometimes deter violence -- though @entity3 's near - freezing temperatures overnight did n't stop agitators from looting businesses and setting dozens of buildings and cars on fire			0
@entity93 , the attorney representing slain teenager @entity58 's family , said @entity58 's parents did n't know what the decision was after dusk fell on @entity3			2
and they found out that the grand jury had reached some sort of decision from watching @entity48			2
" it was very painful on behalf of his mother and father , that they did not get the notice that they were going to find out before the media found out			0
" complete coverage of what 's happening in @entity3			0

timing was meant to allow children , employees to get home , prosecutor 's office says
officials also wanted to let media set up , prosecutor 's office says
but @entity48 legal analyst @entity47 called decision " completely bizarre "
" crowd control is always more difficult in the dark , " he said
