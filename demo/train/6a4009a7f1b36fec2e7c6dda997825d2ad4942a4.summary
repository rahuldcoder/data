@entity0 -- the trial of @entity4 's doctor reached another emotional peak wednesday as jurors heard a recording of @entity4 , using slow and slurred speech , telling dr. @entity9 , " i hurt , you know , i hurt			1
" a photograph of @entity4 lying dead on a hospital gurney was later projected onto a large screen in the courtroom , a vivid reminder to jurors of why they will listen to a least a month of testimony in dr. @entity9 's involuntary manslaughter trial			1
while the court camera feed focused on the disturbing image for just five seconds -- the result of a earlier decision to minimize public exposure to such shocking images -- it was displayed on a large screen in front of the jury for about two minutes			2
forensic computer expert @entity32 , who found the audio file on @entity9 's @entity34 , said it was recorded on may 10 , 2009 , when @entity4 was preparing for his " @entity38 " concerts set for @entity37 two months later			1
prosecutors , who played a clip of the stunning audio in their opening statement last week , let the jury hear the entire recording in @entity9 's involuntary manslaughter trial wednesday			1
" @entity45 did n't do it			0
beatles did n't do it			0
we have to be phenomenal , " @entity4 said			2
" when people leave this show , when people leave my show , i want them to say , ' i 've never seen nothing like this in my life			0

going to have a movie theater , game room			0
" in the portion never before heard in court , @entity4 talked about his life and concern for children : " children are depressed			1
the -- in those hospitals , no game room , no movie theater			0

@entity85 wants me to do it			2
@entity85 wants me to do it			2

" another voice , which the prosecutor said was @entity9 's , is heard saying , " i know you would			1
" " do n't have enough hope , no more hope , " @entity4 said			2
" that 's the next generation that 's going to save our planet , starting with -- we 'll talk about it			0

they reach out to me : ' please take me with you			0
' " at the end , @entity4 said he was " going to do that for them			2
" " that will be remembered more than my performances			0
my performances will be up there helping my children and always be my dream			0
i love them because i did n't have a childhood			0

' @entity129 , ' ' @entity130 , ' ' @entity131 , ' ' @entity132			0
' these are the songs i 've written because i hurt , you know , i hurt			0
" his brother @entity135 wiped tears from his eyes as he listened in court			0
deputy district attorney @entity139 said in his opening statement that @entity4 was " highly under the influences of unknown agents " when @entity9 recorded @entity4			1
another recording found on @entity9 's phone and played in court wednesday was a voice mail from @entity147 , who was @entity4 's last manager			1
@entity147 's message to @entity9 , left five days before @entity4 's death , suggested that he " get a blood test " from @entity135 because " we 've got to see what he 's doing			1
" he referred to " an episode " @entity4 had at a rehearsal the night before			2
" he 's sick , " @entity147 said			0
concert producer @entity156 testified about @entity4 's illness in the first day of the trial , which he wrote about in an e-mail sent about the same time @entity147 was leaving his phone message			1
" he appeared quite weak and fatigued this evening , " @entity156 wrote			0
" he had a terrible case of the chills , was trembling , rambling and obsessing			0
everything in me says he should be psychologically evaluated			0
" jurors should also soon hear the full recording of @entity9 's interview with @entity0 police two days after @entity4 's death			1
@entity9 's @entity34 also contained e-mail attachments that appeared to be @entity4 's medical records sent by @entity9 's office assistant to the doctor , who was gathering them for a @entity177 insurance agent who was arranging cancellation insurance for @entity4 's @entity37 concerts			1
the insurers were concerned about news reports that @entity4 was seen " at various times using a wheelchair " and that he suffered a back injury , lupus , emphysema and cancer , according to an e-mail from the agent to the doctor			2
@entity4 refused to authorize the release of his medical records to the insurance company , @entity9 wrote back , but he added concerning the news reports of illnesses " let me say they 're all fallacious to the best of my knowledge			1
" one record shown in court , kept under the alias " @entity203 , " indicated that in september 2008 , @entity9 diagnosed @entity4 with insomnia and anxiety			1
files from the phone suggest @entity9 was dealing with the insurance agent 's request around the same time he said he was struggling to help @entity4 go to sleep with sedatives			1
the prosecution wants to show jurors that @entity9 was distracted by a long list of phone calls and e-mails , causing him to neglect @entity4 , who stopped breathing and died			1
@entity217 's investigator @entity216 testified wednesday afternoon , showing jurors what she collected from @entity4 's bedroom			1
@entity216 identified a saline bag that was cut open and an empty 100 ml propofol bottle inside			0
the prosecution alleges @entity9 used it as a makeshift iv drip to administer propofol to @entity4			1
the defense contends @entity9 gave @entity4 just 25 ml of the drug and used a syringe to push it in			1
twelve bottles of the surgical anesthetic propofol were found in the bedroom during her first search the day @entity4 died , including an empty vial found on the floor next to the bed , @entity216 said			2
seven bottles of medications were on a nightstand next to the bed , including one with lorazepam pills prescribed by @entity9 to @entity4			1
@entity9 's defense lawyers say @entity4 caused his own death by swallowing eight lorazepam pills and orally ingesting propofol while @entity9 was out of the room			1
the coroner ruled that @entity4 's death on june 25 , 2009 , was the result of " acute propofol intoxication " in combination with sedatives			1
prosecutors argue that @entity9 , who was @entity4 's personal doctor as he prepared for planned comeback concerts , is criminally responsible for the singer 's death because of medical negligence and his reckless use of the propofol to help @entity4 sleep			1
earlier wednesday , a medical supply sales representative testified that a @entity9 assistant " raised a red flag " by asking that she ship an infusion iv set to a @entity263 residence , not his clinic			2
@entity266 rep @entity265 testified that she refused the request and instead sent the supplies , which were apparently recovered from @entity4 's bedroom by investigators , to one of @entity9 's clinics			1
@entity9 trial : no fist fights here tuesday 's testimony by the trio of @entity9 's girlfriends also delivered drama			2
cocktail waitress @entity279 , who dated @entity9 after they met at a @entity282 steakhouse where she worked , described a phone call from @entity9 that prosecutors suggest is evidence of when the doctor realized there was a problem with @entity4			1
five or six minutes into the call , which began at 11:51 a.m. the day @entity4 died , @entity279 realized that @entity9 was not listening to her			1
" i said ' hello , hello , are you there ? ' " @entity279 testified			0
she said that when she pressed her cell phone against her ear , " i heard the mumbling of voices ... and i heard coughing , and nobody answered			0
" @entity279 hung up the phone about three minutes later , she said			0
the interruption , which prosecutors said was probably when @entity9 noticed his patient was not breathing , would have come around 11:57 a.m. , about 10 minutes before the time chef @entity302 said @entity9 ran down the stairs to ask her to call for help			2
the prosecution says that one reason @entity9 is criminally responsible for @entity4 's death is because phone calls and text messages to these women , other patients and employees at his clinics caused him to ignore his patient while administering dangerous drugs			1
@entity316 , 29 , who has a 2 - year - old son fathered by @entity9 , delivered animated testimony tuesday that suggested she was starstruck by @entity4 , whom she met several times with @entity9			1
" i was speechless when i met him , " @entity320 testified			0
" i could n't believe i was meeting @entity4			2
" her testimony was important because it was her apartment where a @entity325 pharmacy shipped 255 bottles of propofol -- totaling more than four gallons -- and 80 bottles of liquid sedatives that prosecutors say @entity9 ordered for @entity4			1
the prosecution also asked her about a phone call @entity9 placed to her from the ambulance while on the way to the hospital with @entity4			1
" i remember him telling me that he was on the way to the hospital in the ambulance with mr. @entity4 and for me not to be alarmed , " @entity320 said			2
" he did n't want me to be worried , because he knew i would learn this through the news			0
" on monday , the emergency room doctor who declared @entity4 dead testified that there was no way doctors could have revived the pop icon after he arrived at the hospital			2
if convicted of involuntary manslaughter , @entity9 could spend four years in a @entity263 prison and lose his medical license .			2
