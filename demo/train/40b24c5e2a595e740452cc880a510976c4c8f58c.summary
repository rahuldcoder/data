-- in this year 's season of commencement speeches , these academic rites of passage have become the subject of fierce political controversy			1
just over the past few months , several prominent invited speakers , including @entity8 , @entity9 , and @entity10 have withdrawn following a campus backlash to news they would be coming to @entity13 , @entity14 , and @entity15 , respectively			1
this trend is not entirely new , since college students have been protesting proposed speakers for many decades			2
but there is some indication that in the age of social networking and the @entity24 , where news spreads around campus and across state lines quickly , the controversies will continue to intensify			0
regardless of what one thinks of the politics of any of the speakers at the center of this year 's debates , these and other incidents could have the unfortunate impact of producing future invitations only to those who will not be controversial or say anything bold			1
rather than big ideas or stimulating thought as a result of commencement exercises , we could head down a road where parents and students congregate to hear a few jokes and milquetoast comments before heading home with their degrees			1
this would be a loss			0
in fact , sometimes commencement speeches have been the venue to introduce bold ideas to the @entity57 public			1
fifty years ago , toward the end of may 1964 , president @entity58 -- just six months after becoming president following the assassination of @entity61 -- stepped up to the podium at the @entity64			1
on a bright sunny day , @entity58 spoke to about 85,000 people who were packed into @entity66 , celebrating the class of ' 64 , to introduce them to the idea of a @entity69 , an idea that would guide a transformation in public policy that lives on today			1
the speech had been a long time in the making			0
for months @entity58 had been struggling to come up with a concept that would describe his legislative agenda			1
@entity76 , who had worked as a special counsel to the @entity78 that had investigated the quiz show scandal in 1959 and who had worked as a speechwriter for president @entity61 , was given the task of solving @entity58 's problem			1
@entity76 had kept a close eye on the growing ferment on the college campuses in the early 1960s , including the establishment of the left - wing @entity88 which was committed to achieving civil rights and participatory democracy			0
@entity76 met with the best experts he knew to come up with a phrase that summed up @entity58 's program			1
@entity96 historian @entity95 , whom @entity58 had recruited as an adviser , said that @entity58 should focus public attention on issues other than economic growth			2
he mentioned the title of a book by the journalist @entity103 , called " @entity104			0
" @entity76 shared the concept with adviser @entity106 who then used it in a number of smaller speeches for @entity58 leading up to the graduation			1
on may 22 , 1964 , @entity58 delivered his 20 minute commencement address , which was only finished the night before , to the exuberant students at @entity114			1
the speech was a smash hit			0
the students interrupted @entity58 several times to applaud			2
@entity58 told the students that the nation had the possibility of reaching beyond merely being a " rich " and " powerful " society to becoming a " @entity69 " that delivered something more			1
he said : " @entity69 rests on abundance and liberty for all			2
it demands an end to poverty and racial injustice , to which we are totally committed in our time			0
but that is just the beginning			0
the @entity69 is a place where every child can find knowledge to enrich his mind and to enlarge his talents			2
... it is a place where the city of man serves not only the needs of the body and the demands of commerce , but the desire for beauty and the hunger of community			0
" " will you join in the battle to give every citizen the full equality which @entity155 enjoins and the law requires , whatever his belief , or race , or the color of his skin ? will you join the battle , " @entity58 asked , " to give every citizen an escape from the crushing weight of poverty ? " @entity76 , who watched the speech from the @entity167 , felt as " if i were hearing the words for the first time , experiencing the exhilarating revelation of suddenly widening horizons			1
... i clapped for the president , and for our country			2
" @entity58 was exhilarated by the response			2
on @entity176 , he walked to the back of the plane to recap the key points with reporters so that they did not miss them for their stories			0
the speech provided powerful motivation to legislators and activists who struggled over the next few years to pass legislation that enhanced the power of the federal government to provide support for education , medical care , voting rights , environmental programs , housing support and more			0
today , liberals can certainly look back at the speech for inspiration , finding a powerful set of arguments to use to justify government intervention through programs such as the minimum wage , health care , and green jobs			0
@entity58 's vision in the speech was that the government could help make the quality of life better for all @entity57 and provide the tools that every citizen needed to become self - sufficient and independent actors			1
some of the programs did n't turn out as well as he hoped			0
but others , such as @entity214 for the aged and voting rights for african - americans , proved to be stunning successes			0
the ideas that @entity58 proposed were certainly controversial			1
at the time a powerful bloc of @entity221 conservative democrats and @entity222 controlled @entity223 and had little appetite for growing government			0
republicans were about to nominate @entity228 sen. @entity227 as their nominee for the 1964 election , indicating that the right - wing was a growing presence in national politics			0
for every organization like the students for @entity237 there was another , like the conservative @entity239 that saw the future through a much different lens			0
commencement talks can be more than about celebrity , funny quips , and attention - gaining opportunities for colleges			1
they can be moments that truly inspire and change the national conversation			0
a little over 50 years ago , @entity58 was able to accomplish that in @entity251 .			2

controversy led three speakers to drop out of commencement talks this year
@entity257 : it would be a shame if colleges only invited those who give bland , *inoffensive* speeches
commencement speeches can be an opportunity to introduce bold ideas , he says
president @entity58 made a stirring case in 1964 for his vision of a " @entity69 "
