-- when @entity2 bought his first computer at the age of 21 , he was hooked			0
just two years on , @entity2 runs his own mobile gaming company called @entity6 from an office in the @entity9 capital of @entity10			1
@entity2 recalled how he was able to buy the pc as part of a government scheme to get more computers into homes			0
" it was a @entity20 , " he said , " my mum paid half for it and i paid the other half			0
it was about 1.3 million @entity9 shillings ( $ 500 )			0
" @entity2 soon went on to set up @entity6 with two friends			1
" initially , we started the business in my home , " he said			0
" it 's very common in @entity29 for people to play traditional card games and we make these games available on mobile			1
" at first , the company developed a two - player app called @entity36 , a digital version of an old @entity9 card game by the same name			1
@entity36 proved a smash hit , with 20,000 people downloading the game through the @entity43 , @entity44 and the @entity45			2
today , @entity6 makes educational games with a fun twist			1
the company 's zombie spelling game , @entity50 , is designed to help children and adults improve their @entity54 language skills			1
in order to fight off hordes of zombies , the player must spell words correctly within a time limit			0
" the faster you type , the faster they die , " reads the website 's slogan			2
according to @entity67 , over a quarter of the @entity9 population is illiterate and @entity2 hopes games like @entity69 will help to tackle the problem			0
" it was just a concept that we were experimenting with , " he said			0
" we wanted to put the app into schools to help kids to spell			0
there is a major challenge in the fight against illiteracy			0
" despite @entity6 ' meteoric rise , the developer runs on a small staff of just five people			1
@entity2 said the company is starting to take on interns but recruiting workers with the right skills is proving difficult			0
after learning how to use a pc as a teenager and studying computer science at @entity91 , in @entity10 , @entity2 is just one countless budding entrepreneurs to start a tech business in @entity29			1
the continent 's burgeoning smartphone market is giving @entity29 's enterprising individuals the chance to launch businesses , create jobs and develop a skilled workforce			1
@entity2 said : " phones are more popular than computers in @entity29			1
it 's less than $ 100 now for a smartphone			1
" and mobile games apps are spreading			2
@entity108 startup @entity106 produces games that reflect the lives of average @entity108 -- including " @entity111 , " in which the player weaves in and out of the pot - holed roads of @entity114 , avoiding oncoming traffic			1
in february this year , @entity29 developer @entity116 opened for business			1
the @entity119 - based company is one of many indie game designers springing up in @entity29 's largest economy			1
just seven months after its launch , @entity116 released its flagship app , @entity125			1
the game , which can also run on pc and @entity127 , features a cheeky garden mollusk as players go on a quest to find his shell , stolen from him by the sneaky " @entity132			2
" @entity116 co-founder @entity133 said that @entity125 is attracting a wide audience and @entity29 is fast becoming a hub for creative talent in mobile gaming			1
" it does n't matter necessarily what country you 're in			0
it 's not specifically about what games people want , or what genre they like playing , " he added			2
" if something is easily accessible , it 's cheap and it makes me feel good then i want to play it			2
" and @entity133 's comments are reflected in the figures , with @entity125 performing well in far away @entity108 and @entity152			0
as well as a sequel to @entity125 , @entity116 is already planning to roll out two more games next year			1
finding the investment despite the success of @entity158 and @entity116 , funding remains a problem for many @entity29 entrepreneurs , who struggle to get the financial backing to expand workforces and reinvest in their companies			1
@entity116 is fully funded by personal investments from staff while @entity2 and his friends ploughed their own savings into @entity6 to kick - start the company			1
" eventually we got investment from the @entity173 , " @entity2 said			0
based in @entity174 , @entity173 is a venture capital firm that provides $ 25,000 - $ 500,000 investments in high - growth technology web and mobile startups in @entity178			2
@entity179 , managing partner at @entity173 , said : " people are doing more of their payments , work and lifestyle on their phone			0
whether that 's looking up directions , looking for a service or buying something online such as music or games			0
" @entity179 , who previously worked in @entity191 , said that @entity173 has nine investments spanning @entity29 from @entity152 and @entity9 to @entity108 and @entity193			2
" as @entity29 sees its middle class rising , we 're going to see people who want to consume			2
if this fund was here 10 years ago , this would n't have been viable , " he said			0
the fund aims to address skills and the experience gap of entrepreneurs in the region through its @entity205 , designed to help individuals build a company and launch products			0
but @entity179 is keen to stress that the @entity173 is not a social project			0
" it 's about building long - term sustainable businesses , " @entity179 added , " we 're not trying to quick flip things			2
we 're not trying to get the same growth as @entity191			0
i 'm not here to just make a quick buck			0
we 're going to stick it out			0
" with funding behind him and a growing team , @entity2 wants to expand his gaming empire beyond @entity152 and @entity9 to more nations around the continent			2
the young entrepreneur believes @entity6 can make a success of developing traditional @entity29 games , handed down from generation to generation , by moving them into the smartphone world			1
when asked about his ambitions for the future , @entity2 said : " if we can have the most played game in @entity29 that would be really cool			1

@entity29 's burgeoning smartphone market is driving growth in gaming apps
@entity6 creates gaming apps , including zombie - killing game
@entity116 is one of a number of @entity29 game developers
but @entity29 game makers often struggle for funding
