-- the @entity2 government allegedly spied on prominent @entity2 muslims under the same program it used to keep tabs on suspected terrorists , according to documents held by @entity10 whistleblower @entity9			1
journalists @entity11 and @entity13 , writing for @entity14 , said @entity9 provided them documents that show that at least five @entity2 @entity3 were monitored by their own government for periods between 2002 and 2008			1
the names of @entity20 operative and lawyer @entity21 ; attorney @entity22 ; international relations professor @entity23 ; @entity3 civil liberties advocate @entity25 ; and the executive director of the @entity27 , @entity28 , all appear on a spreadsheet that purportedly lists individuals under @entity10 , @entity32 or @entity34 digital surveillance			1
the spreadsheet shows more than 7,000 e-mail addresses that appear to include the names of foreigners linked to terrorist organizations and @entity2 citizens suspected of terrorist activity , according to @entity14 's report			1
but also on the list are the names of the five prominent @entity45 , who have never been accused or charged with terrorism , and who deny any involvement in terrorism			1
accusations of profiling two of them -- @entity53 and @entity22 -- told @entity0 that they were targeted just because they are @entity3 , a violation of their rights			2
" i ca n't think of any other reason , " @entity53 said			1
no other reason , " @entity22 said			1
@entity53 said he had a security clearance working in the @entity2 @entity59			2
" that 's why my no. 1 reaction was of shock and surprise because there 's nothing in my background that would lead any law enforcement agency to suspect me of any acts of terror , " @entity53 said			1
@entity22 is a civil rights attorney who represented clients in terrorism - related cases			1
" if it 's my clients that 's causing it , " @entity22 said of the alleged spying on him , " that 's a reason for pause -- to find out what benefit does the government have listening in on the lawyer 's communications with his or her client ? what information can they use in court ? " imagine a government lawyer telling his or her supervisors we had to listen to his calls and maybe we can go to court to beat him , " @entity22 said			1
@entity22 said that the government apparently spied on his @entity97 e-mail -- not his e-mail with his law firm			0
" i feel sorry for the agents who had to read all of that			0
there 's not a whole lot you will get from my @entity97 account , " @entity22 said			2
opinion : a year after @entity9 , the real costs of @entity10 surveillance @entity53 served in the @entity109 and later became a senior policy adviser in the @entity2 @entity59 under president @entity111			1
@entity53 also worked as a spokesman for @entity113 , whose founder and executive director , @entity116 , was sentenced to 23 years in prison in 2004 for activities with nations and groups with ties to terrorism			0
but the @entity2 government allegedly spied on @entity53 from 2006 to 2008 -- after @entity53 left the council and when @entity53 was the @entity20 nominee for a seat in the @entity126 , journalist @entity11 told @entity0			0
@entity53 said he did not know @entity116 and hardly had contact with him			0
moreover , after he left the @entity3 council , @entity53 disclosed that job to the @entity2 government , which eventually gave him a security clearance			0
" surveillance needs to happen but there has to be a reason for it , " @entity53 said			2
" there was nothing in my background			0
" he asserted that authorities have a 99.6 % success rate in obtaining warrants from the secret foreign intelligence surveillance , or @entity146 , @entity147 , which rules on @entity2 requests to do surveillance on suspected terrorists and spies			0
@entity53 described that success rate " ridiculous			0
" " if you go to any county in the @entity2 ... it would not be that high			2
clearly there is something wrong , " @entity53 said			0
@entity53 told @entity14 that he believes that his e-mails were intercepted because he is @entity3			0
" look , i 've never made an appearance or been a lawyer for anyone who 's been ( associated with terrorism ) , " he told @entity14			2
" but there are plenty of other lawyers who have made those appearances and actually represented those governments , and their name is n't @entity21 and they were n't born in @entity169 and they are n't on this list			0
" @entity2 response in a joint statement , the @entity172 and the @entity173 denied that the @entity2 government conducts surveillance based on anyone 's politics , religion or activism			1
" unlike some other nations , the @entity2 does not monitor anyone 's communications in order to suppress criticism or to put people at a disadvantage based on their ethnicity , race , gender , sexual orientation or religion , " the statement said			1
any surveillance of @entity2 citizens requires a court order from the @entity147 , the statement says			0
" these court orders are issued by an independent federal judge only if probable cause , based on specific facts , are established that the person is an agent of a foreign power , a terrorist , a spy , or someone who takes orders from a foreign power , " the statement says			1
but @entity14 reported that at least one of the five @entity2 @entity3 was spied on without a @entity146 warrant			0
in addition , one of the documents provided to @entity210 instructs agents on the proper way to compose a memo to request @entity146 surveillance			2
in the example , it lists a fake name -- " @entity219 " -- as a placeholder			0
an @entity10 spokeswoman quoted in the report said that the agency would not allow such insulting language to be used in its training documents			1
@entity226 , the nation 's largest @entity3 civil liberties group and led by @entity28 , called for a full accounting of government spying on @entity2 muslims			2
" this is an outrageous continuation of civil rights era surveillance of minority community leadership by government elements who see threats in all patriotic dissent , " the group said in a statement			0
@entity240 calls in @entity2 ambassador over new spying allegation @entity243 summons @entity2 diplomat over report of @entity10 spying review board finds potential for abuses in @entity10 phone , internet surveillance			1

new : " my no. 1 reaction was of shock and surprise , " a @entity45 says
new : " if it 's my clients that 's causing it ... that 's a reason for pause , " another says
the report is based on documents leaked by @entity10 whistle - blower @entity9
the @entity173 says it does not spy based on religious views
