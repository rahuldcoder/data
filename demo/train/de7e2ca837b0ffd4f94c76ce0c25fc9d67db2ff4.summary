another matchday , another morgue full of bodies ; another crowd of mothers broken by grief , weeping for the souls of their dead sons			1
soccer should never be about survival , it should never be about counting coffins , but sunday was another dark night in @entity14			1
around 20 fans of @entity16 were killed outside the @entity17 in @entity18 before a top of the table clash with @entity21			2
@entity14 officials announced that 19 people had been killed			1
@entity16 fans posted the pictures of corpses on social media			2
a crush had developed outside the narrow , single entrance -- more of a cage covered in barbed wire -- through which the thousands of fans were expected to walk through			2
as the fans tried to push their way in , it appeared that riot police fired tear gas into the crowd			1
before the bodies were cold , the blame game had begun			2
@entity41 , @entity16 's president , immediately blamed the @entity42 ( @entity43 ) -- the club 's organized group of fans -- and absolved the police of all blame			2
@entity14 's interior ministry also blamed the fans , saying in a statement : " they climbed the fence			1
the security forces tried to disperse them , the fans fled to the main road and blocked traffic and stopped the bus carrying the @entity16 soccer team			2
" they set fire to a police vehicle			2
we got reports of fatalities because of a stampede			2
" we have heard this before , of course , and semantics are important			2
were the young men -- for they are always young men -- killed ? was it a riot ? or was it naked violence ? was it an accident or was it murder ? to understand why this is important you have to go back to @entity14 's revolution on january 25 , 2011			1
back then , the regime of former president @entity80 seemed impenetrable			2
@entity80 had successfully run a brutal police state for decades , and almost all opposition had been neutered			2
but when the deep unhappiness with the state of the country and the lack of freedoms burst forth in @entity89 , three groups emerged at the front : activists , the @entity91 and , strikingly , @entity14 's soccer ultras			1
ultras are organized fan groups who religiously follow their @entity96 are anti-authoritarian , independently minded and have no time for the mainstream press who characterize them as violence - addicted hooligans			1
but the truth was more complex than that			2
in 2007 i met the founders of the @entity106 , the ultras group of @entity108 -- @entity14 's biggest team and @entity16 's main rival			1
what began as support for a team with @entity115 - style banners and songs about @entity117 , their greatest ever player , became something much more dangerous for the authorities			1
for years @entity108 fans were attacked by police as they tried to watch their favorite team play			2
but the ultras , who had obtained a degree of anonymity in numbers and within the huge terraces of the @entity129 , fought back			1
" it was n't just supporting a team ; you were fighting a system and the country as a whole , " one of the @entity108 founders told me in 2011			1
" we were fighting the police , fighting the government , fighting for our rights ... this was something new , a little bit of a seed that was planted four years later			0
" when the revolution came , the ultras were on the front lines			1
they were the only groups that had experience confronting the police			1
the two teams maintain a historic rivalry but , briefly , the fans of @entity108 and @entity16 -- as well as supporters from other ultras groups -- joined forces in @entity89 and in the other cities around @entity14			1
in those fleeting , free moments in post-revolution @entity14 , the ultras were revered as protectors of the revolution			1
but as the authorities slowly reasserted their power , the narrative changed			1
on february 1 , 2012 , 72 members of the @entity106 were killed at a football match against @entity168 in @entity169			0
at first , the authorities said it was hooliganism , violence between two sets of fans -- nothing more , nothing less			1
but it soon emerged that this could n't have been further from the truth			0
a moving televised testimony by a fan who was there turned the tide of public opinion in favour of the @entity106			0
the @entity106 maintained that the incident was organised by the state , a political assassination of a group that had become too powerful			0
yet a measure of justice , at least temporarily , had been won			0
the league was suspended , and the @entity106 picketed the stadiums , successfully preventing the league from returning until justice was done			0
death sentences were passed down on a number of @entity168 fans , and some officials were even jailed			0
the @entity169 tragedy showed that protest could affect change			0
but this is a new @entity14			1
the democratically - elected president , @entity205 , was deposed in a coup and replaced by @entity207			0
hundreds of @entity91 supporters have been shot dead at protests			0
activists , like @entity211 , have died whilst protesting peacefully			0
the groups that led the revolution from the front are slowly being removed from view			1
the image that will stay with me from sunday night is the video posted on @entity219 of a police officer firing tear gas canisters into the crowd gathered outside the ground			0
the crowd is so packed that it is clear no one can escape			0
it was the kind of casual brutality by the police towards the supporters that i 'd experienced before the revolution			1
but the comparison here is n't with @entity80 , with the revolution , or even with @entity169			1
at @entity236 in @entity237 , @entity238 , 96 @entity235 fans were crushed to death at the start of an @entity242 match in 1989			0
immediately the narrative had been set : the fans were drunk ; they rushed the turnstiles ; they stole from the bodies of the dead			1
the victims were besmirched by the police and newspapers like @entity251 for 25 years , families have been fighting for justice			0
the verdict that the fans ' deaths were accidental has been overturned , and a new coroner 's inquest is underway to determine how all 96 victims died			0
we may never get to the bottom of what happened on sunday night			0
the @entity16 president , a keen supporter of president @entity264 , had already dubbed the @entity42 a terrorist organization			0
" they are not fans , they are criminals , " @entity41 said in an interview with @entity267 last month			0
" they are using bombs , live ammunition and shotgun pellets ... and last week they threw acid at me -- but i continue because this is part of the nation 's battle against terrorism			0
" the acid turned out to be human urine			0
several ultras were jailed for the incident			1
the authorities announced that the leaders of the @entity43 would be rounded up and arrested			1
the @entity43 called sunday 's incident a " deliberate massacre			0
" fact and fiction seamlessly intertwine in the aftermath of chaos			0
what is clear is that the league has , once again , been suspended indefinitely as the funerals of those killed take place in the coming hours			0
meanwhile @entity14 is again counting the numbers of the dead			1
it is far from the hope and optimism i had been lucky to experience in @entity89 in 2011			1
as @entity308 once wrote , " revolutions have never lightened the load of tyranny , they have only shifted it to another shoulder			0
" and the match the fans died trying to watch ? it went ahead anyway			0
it finished 1 - 1 .			0

in the fleeting , free moments in post-revolution @entity14 , the ultras were revered as protectors of the revolution , argues @entity322
as the authorities slowly reasserted their power , the narrative changed , he says
the deadly riot is " far from the hope and optimism i had been lucky to experience in @entity89 in 2011 " @entity322 writes
