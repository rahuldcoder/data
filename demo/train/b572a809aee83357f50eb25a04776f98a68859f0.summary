" every indication we 've had so far is that this year 's going to be a good one , " said @entity19 , senior vice president of the @entity2 / @entity20			1
the chamber is the managing arm of the city 's involvement in @entity8 , a 10 - day event that @entity19 said takes an entire year to prepare for			1
events like @entity8 and its little brother , @entity31 , are what keep @entity2 running , @entity19 said			1
with 8.5 million visitors each year , special events bring in about $ 1.3 billion			1
the two biker events alone generate $ 650 million of that , he said			1
the festival did n't always pack in a half - million people , though			1
in 1988 , said @entity40 , the @entity2 police chief at the time , the event had morphed into something very different from what it was when it started			1
he said he had to battle what he called " the 1 percent problem " -- the small group of gangs whose viciousness and threats against outsiders had allowed them to take over @entity8			2
he decided he would n't have any more of their troublemaking , @entity40 said , so he created a task force that evolved into the office of special investigations for the @entity56			0
its specific purpose was to deal with the problem			0
today , @entity8 has been restored as family - friendly event			2

" these are people with a lot of disposable income , " @entity19 said			2
" they can afford a $ 30,000 toy			2
" factors like the economy and this year 's long hard winter probably got people more excited about @entity8 because it 's a chance to get away , he said			1
" everybody needs a break			0
" @entity83 , 50 , a radio producer from @entity85 , @entity3 , has been going to @entity8 for four years			1
he said he goes to " keep updated on motorcycle stuff as far as styles , what 's done to them , meet people who enjoy bikes , to get patches and all the toy stuff , so to speak , and enjoy other people who enjoy the same thing			2
" the ride from @entity85 is only 35 minutes , and he said that 's half the fun			0
" everybody should go -- whether you have a bike or not -- at least once , just to take it in and see what it 's about , " @entity83 said			0
@entity6 , 52 , also a radio producer in @entity85 , grew up in @entity2 and has been going to @entity8 his entire life			1
he said it 's been more fun in recent years , though			0
" it 's more fun when you actually have a motorcycle , " he said			0
" you get out there and ride alongside people			0
you 're part of the roar , the noise			0
" not only is @entity8 becoming more family - friendly , but it 's more diverse as well , with more women participants , said @entity114 , president and ceo of @entity116			2
there 's even a " sisterhood bikeride " in which 35 to 50 women ride together			0
@entity2 - based @entity116 specifically markets accessories and motorcycles for women			2
this year , @entity114 said , the company is unveiling a new motorcycle designed by women and made specifically for women and their needs			0
