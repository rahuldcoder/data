from parent to son , uncle to nephew , grandparent to grandson , there 's a raw , private conversation being re-energized in @entity8 in the wake of violence in @entity11 , @entity12			1
it 's an intimate lecture that most @entity8 wo n't know , but parents like @entity15 of @entity16 know it too well because it begins the loss of their children 's innocence and exposes them to a painful national truth that 's increasingly become a matter of life or death			1
as challenging as parenting is , black families in particular are assuming more burdens : at kitchen tables and in living rooms , they hold honest talks with their boys about how life can be different for them and what they ought -- and ought not -- to do in public , especially near police			1
think twice about wearing a hoodie			2
shut your mouth around police			2
do n't drive with more than three friends			2
and keep your hands where they can be seen			2
these are just a few examples of the rules that parents tell their young black sons -- and sometimes daughters -- about how to stay safe			1
though stark and blunt , the admonishments follow a trend of violence that touches upon the most fiery issue in @entity8 : race			2
the 2012 shooting death of @entity56 , the 2013 police shooting of a @entity60 man who was apparently seeking only help and this week 's riots against @entity11 police -- these sensational cases all involve shooting victims who were unarmed , young black men			1
my son knows he could be @entity56 " i 've had this conversation with my son since middle school on how to behave , " said @entity67 , 46 , of @entity68 , @entity16			1
" when the police come , this is what you do			2
this is how you speak to them			2
do not get into a power struggle			2
if they are trying to give you a ticket , get the ticket			1
because it 's not worth it			2
it 's just not worth it			2
" a ' sad ' day and time whether at reunions , picnics , or the mall , families and friends make it a point to apprise sons , nephews or grandsons of what @entity67 calls " the rules of engagement " for young black men when they encounter police or other figures of authorities			1
@entity103 tells his eldest child , @entity104 , 15 , to be aware of even how he dresses			1
" i stress to him his appearance is important , the way he conducts himself , the way he talks to people , " said @entity103 , 44 , a tow truck driver who lives @entity105			1
his wife , @entity110 , 42 , said the @entity16 couple worry about their four children every day			2
" you do n't know what 's going to happen between dropping them off and them coming home , " she said			2
@entity119 , a @entity120 in @entity122 pastor in south @entity105 , and his wife , @entity123 , constantly urge caution with son @entity125 , 15			1
" basically you have to separate yourself in this day and time			2
it 's sad but it 's true			2
they profile you just by first appearances , " @entity129 said			2
such talks have taken on greater urgency in the wake of the @entity11 police shooting and killing of unarmed 18 - year - old @entity139 last week , one expert said			1
witnesses say @entity139 was holding his hands in the air when he was fatally shot			0
the hashtags # @entity143 and # @entity145 trended on @entity146 this week , with parents and children sharing on social media when they had such tough conversations			1
" here we go again " was the reaction of education expert @entity152 about the @entity11 incident			1
" we have another instance in what an @entity157 man loses his life because of something that seems like it went awry , " @entity152 said			0
as a principal of a nationally recognized magnet school in @entity163 and an @entity157 father , @entity152 said it 's important for parents to explain to youths the expediency of just getting home safely			1
" if you have a black son , and you 're not taking the time to explain to him what he needs to do when he 's out in the streets , how he needs to dress and how he needs to act and explain to him that he actually does have a target on his back -- then you are not doing your job as a parent , " @entity152 said			1
other experts say other minority families should hold such a talk with their children			1
" the bottom line is we are living in a @entity186 , @entity188 trial world , and any parent of color -- latino or @entity157 - @entity157 parent -- must have these conversations with their children			0
it is just really reality , " said @entity194 , a former federal prosecutor and legal commentator			0
" it is the same conversation i think that many parents have about stranger danger ; the same conversation that parents have with their children about look both ways before you cross the street			1
" a case study @entity152 recalled how he , too , was racially profiled by police			0
he offered the account as a case study in how black youths should respond in such scenarios			1
" when the police pull you over , you have to do everything you can do to mitigate the situation to lower the level to just get home , " @entity152 said			0
" i 've been in that situation myself			0
i was riding home with my wife and kids and i had a hoodie on and i guess i was driving something nice , that i should n't have been driving faster than the police thought i should 've been driving , and i was pulled over and the police officer got real slick			0
he said some things to me that i thought were completely inappropriate			0
" i said absolutely nothing			0
i made no fast movements			0
i did everything i could to just get my family home , " @entity152 said			0
@entity152 later complained to the officer 's boss and received a written apology , he said			0
@entity152 blamed a broad trend for the way young black men are treated			1
" black males are criminalized from the time we enter the ' system , ' and i 'm talking about school , " @entity152 said			1
" from the time children enter the system , @entity157 - @entity157 males are the most suspended , most punished of any group			0
" how children react the guidance can be difficult for youngsters to swallow			0
" i think sometimes i am an @entity157 man , young man , why should i be afraid to walk down the street and get discriminated against because of the color i am , or the way i am dressed or the way i look ? " said @entity252 , 15			1
not too surprisingly , the boys may not fully appreciate their parents ' caution			1
sometimes , they accept it sheepishly			0
" my parents really care about me			1
that 's what they are there for , " said @entity263 , 15			1
" some stuff , me being a teenager , i think they are too overbearing on , but this is for my safety			0
and with this whole situation , the young man who got killed , i see why			1
" @entity67 's son , @entity272 , who 's now 26 , declined to be interviewed by @entity273 at first			1
the subject was too emotional , and he suggested that sometimes his mother may be worrying too much			0
then he changed his mind about the interview			0
" i think she has a right to worry			0
she 's a little bit too worried , but i do n't blame her , " @entity67 said			0
trim , athletic , sporting a type of goatee known as the balbo , @entity67 said he is a law - abiding working professional			0
he 's a technician in the hyperbaric chamber at the @entity288 , @entity105			0
the parental talks , he now says , are " very necessary			1
" " i do n't look like trouble			0
i do n't dress like it			0
i went to college and graduated , and i still have problems like the next kid , " @entity67 said			0
in one example , he was outside his house with his girlfriend when police asked him what he was doing			0
" i 'm clearly talking to my girlfriend and he says , ' why do n't you go crip walk back up into your house , ' " he said			1
he said nothing , though his initial response was to " go back and forth with him , " he said			0
" they want to provoke you but ... my mom and my family told me and taught me how to deal with them , " @entity67 said			0
" a kid who maybe did n't have the same kind of family , he 's going to go argue with the police like it was the next man and that 's where trouble comes			0
" it helps to have parents or family to give you an education on how to deal with that stuff , " @entity67 said .			1
