@entity0 , @entity1 -- ten of @entity1 's 12 oil refineries were stopping production friday , an oil industry spokesman said , as the country went through a fourth straight day of strikes over pension reforms			1
unions said workers at all 12 refineries were taking part in the strike			1
@entity14 , a spokesman for the @entity15 , said there is currently no rupture in the fuel supply , but that did not stop consumers from lining up at gas stations across the country to stock up on fuel , just in case			1
the work stoppage at the refineries was having a direct effect on the two main @entity0 airports , @entity28 and @entity29			1
both are supplied by a pipeline that comes directly from refineries that were shut down friday , according to @entity33 , the company that owns the line			1
while @entity28 said it has enough fuel to last for 17 days , @entity1 media reported that @entity29 has enough fuel to last at least through the weekend			1
a spokesman for @entity40 would not confirm how many days the @entity29 fuel would last if the pipelines continued to be blocked , but said there was no concern			0
" we are not at all worried right now , " the spokesman said			0
the strike is over government pension reforms , which have passed the lower house of @entity50 and are now awaiting approval by the @entity52			0
workers are especially upset over plans to raise the retirement age from 60 to 62 , a provision that has already been approved by both houses of @entity50			0
it will not become law , however , until the @entity52 approves the full spate of reforms			0
the strike is the fourth by unions in the past month and the first one to go longer than 24 hours			2
unions have said it will be open - ended , with a vote each day about whether to continue the walkout the following day			2
@entity1 president @entity68 indicated thursday that his government would not back down in the face of strikes			1
" our duty is to act ; to act in the public interest , act with justice , but to act , " he said , according to a report in the @entity0 daily newspaper @entity73			2
another concern friday was the increasing number of high school students joining the protest			2
there were demonstrations friday in several @entity1 cities including @entity0 , where students were in front of the @entity52 to protest the bill			1
student protests led to " disruptions " at 342 schools across the country thursday , the @entity88 said			0
@entity93 was suffering only minor disruptions			0
local transport services like subways and buses were operating well , though only half of the high - speed tgv trains were running , officials said			0
