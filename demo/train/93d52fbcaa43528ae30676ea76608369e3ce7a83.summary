-- the success achieved by @entity3 soccer coach @entity2 suggests that his players would not just run through a brick wall for him ; they 'd happily march through an obstacle course full of them to earn his respect			1
the self - proclaimed " @entity16 " is the flamboyant manager of @entity11 champions @entity10 who are currently on course to take the @entity15 title for the fifth consecutive year			2
but if his current @entity10 squad love him , then his former @entity18 players adore him , after his successful stint at the club between 2004 and 2007 delivered their first @entity23 triumphs in over 50 years			1
@entity26 international and @entity18 stalwart @entity24 says of @entity2 : " i love him as a man and as a manager			1
" the two sets of players collide in @entity32 's most prestigious club competition -- the @entity33 -- on wednesday , when all eyes will be on the game 's ultimate touchline showman in his first competitive match against his old club			1
but how does @entity2 arouse such complete loyalty from his employees ? and is he everything a good boss should be ? he does and he is , according to sports psychologist @entity43			1
respect " @entity2 's role with his players is the same as it should be in any office , " @entity43 told @entity0			1
" he is very , very supportive of them and treats them as equals			2
he knows he needs to focus people on what they do well , and then on what they need to do to improve			0
" sometimes in the workplace managers think it is all about being ruthless when that is the least effective way of doing things			0
appraisals can turn into a long list of what employees do wrong			0
that does n't help at all ; it puts them in a negative mind set			0
" but @entity2 will always look to turn a positive into a negative			2
if a team is 3 - 0 down at half time and the manager starts screaming about all the mistakes they 've made it is n't going to help			0
instead he 'll focus on some of the things they are doing right , and then tell them how they can turn the game around			0
" you have to be specific about what is required ; that way , the player or employee starts to build up a mental image of what is needed			0
a good manager is committed to trying to get the best out of an individual , and knowing how each member of staff ticks			0
@entity2 is a master at that			2
" protection @entity43 says @entity2 is desperate to alleviate as much pressure as possible from his players , and is quite prepared to do something outrageous to shield them from criticism			1
@entity2 was hit with a three - game ban following a gesture he made during saturday 's controversial 0 - 0 draw against @entity98			1
after two of his players were sent off @entity2 crossed his arms in the manner of being handcuffed -- a suggestion that @entity10 were being victimized by match officials			1
previously this season , after another poor @entity10 performance , @entity2 leapt off the team coach to physically confront a journalist who he said had invaded his players ' space			1
the media uproar after the confrontation deflected attention from the bad result , and made sure he was the story instead			0
one of his players , @entity115 , confirmed the success of this tactic in an interview with newspaper @entity119 : " there is no coach like him when it comes to sticking his neck out and defending everyone , that way reducing the tension within the team when things are n't going well			2
it 's no fluke that after a defeat , @entity10 gets straight back on its feet			1
that 's all thanks to @entity2			2
" self belief underpinning @entity2 's approach is an unwavering self belief that he transmits to his players , as @entity43 explained : " @entity2 's self belief is palpable and you can read it in everything -- his body language and how he speaks -- you know he has complete trust in his abilities and that gives his players confidence			1
" he 's like a general on the touchline , commanding his troops and he explodes sometimes			0
he may do it heighten the opposition players arousal levels , to inspire in them an intense desire to beat him , and that can throw them off their game and affect their decision making			0
he very much makes it us against the world			0
" there is another intriguing subplot to the @entity10 versus @entity18 clash			1
the @entity168 side are now managed by @entity11 coach @entity169 , who left @entity10 's bitter rivals @entity170 this summer			1
a running battle between the pair erupted during their stint in opposite dugouts and it continued even after @entity169 left for @entity176			0
@entity2 has been quoted as saying : " @entity169 is no friend of mine			2
" the @entity11 replied by referring to his rival as " @entity179 " in his autobiography			0
@entity2 often says inflammatory things about opposition players and managers before a big game but @entity43 says @entity2 may take a different approach in the build up to wednesday 's crucial match			1
he told @entity0 : " i do n't think he will be confrontational about his return clash against @entity18 because he has always professed his love for the club and the players he used to coach but he will make a few jibes about @entity169 , and could try to undermine his position by talking about his own success at the club			1
" the thing about @entity2 is that you do n't know what he 's going to do next but whatever it is it will be because he thinks it is beneficial to the team			2
@entity2 will definitely be looking forward to going back			0
he will thrive on the attention and will be happy to keep the pressure from his team			0

@entity10 coach @entity2 inspires *absolute* loyalty in his players
@entity10 face @entity2 's old club , @entity18 , in the @entity33
sports psychologist @entity43 says @entity2 is an ideal boss
@entity43 says @entity2 treats his players as equals to gain their respect
