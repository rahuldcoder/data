-- the recent smartphone video of @entity2 urinating on the bodies of slain @entity4 should trouble all @entity5			1
it is troubling even if allowances are made for young men -- recently released from the high pressures of combat and in the euphoria of being successful and still being alive -- doing dumb things			0
it should trouble us even allowing for the inevitable dehumanization of the enemy that often accompanies conflict			2
keeping the human aspect of an enemy in mind is more than just a moral imperative , though			2
it makes good operational and strategic sense			0
and in this , intelligence has a special role			0
one of the first briefings i gave president @entity31 as deputy director of national intelligence was on @entity34 , the fiendishly brutal head of @entity35 in @entity36			0
i began with @entity34 's upbringing : " raised on the mean streets of @entity41 , jailed as a teenager , he turned to religion in prison ... " i was less trying to humanize him than to understand him , but the effect was largely the same			2
and even duly " humanized , " @entity34 remained our highest priority target in @entity36 until we killed him the next year			0
recognizing this human aspect of an enemy takes on even greater significance when a belligerent decides that it 's time to negotiate with an adversary , when it 's decided ( or reluctantly accepted ) that you will not be able to simply impose your will on him			1
this , by the way , is different than concluding that someone with whom you are still engaged in combat is no longer your enemy , as vice president @entity60 recently did when describing the @entity4			1
but it does mean that you are willing to recognize that he has legitimate political interests and you are willing to talk about them			0
under any circumstance , talks with the @entity4 will be a difficult task			1
for one thing , the pressure we can bring to bear on our negotiating partner diminishes daily as @entity5 troops leave @entity74 based on an accelerated timetable rather than on battlefield conditions			1
a recent survey of national security wonks like myself had a full three - quarters of respondents either opposing these talks or saying they are likely to fail			2
so this is going to be tough and , as in many difficult undertakings , intelligence will be expected to play an important role			2
@entity4 has met with @entity5 officials , wo n't negotiate with @entity88 at the most basic level , intelligence will be asked what are the @entity4 's interests or more precisely what is it they think they are			1
intelligence will work to steal secrets : what are their demands , their going - in positions , their true red lines ? in this case , negotiators will also want to know whether their @entity4 interlocutors actually speak for the whole			1
can they deliver on an agreement ? i recall during the @entity31 administration , in one of our periodic crises with @entity110 , being asked by the president : " what does @entity112 want ? " it was a question that went to the nature of the man			0
i responded with the often true but rarely useful , " i do n't know			0
" and i little helped the situation by meekly adding that i doubted that he did either			0
we did better during later negotiations with @entity121 where , despite whatever negotiating strategy was being proposed , we stuck to the line that we saw little chance that @entity125 would ever give up his nuclear weapons			0
we 'll need the intelligence agencies to be equally accurate and equally firm in their judgments when it comes to the @entity4 talks			1
intelligence may be able to help in other ways since it has been routine for @entity5 intelligence officials to meet with and come to agreement with foreign counterparts , many of whom share little of our world view , our values or even our interests			1
a good thing , too , since one of the continuities between presidents @entity31 and @entity144 has been the willingness to work with some unsavory partners such as president @entity147 of @entity148 or several recent incarnations of @entity151 's @entity150			2
i can recall many a meeting with counterparts where the common space where we might find agreement was challengingly small			0
in some of those sessions , my counterpart would depart the seemingly fact - based dialogue we had been sharing and launch into a series of conclusions based more on his culture 's creation mythology than on any shared reality i could identify			2
for a time , i thought it sufficient to simply avoid signaling any agreement at these moments and patiently tolerate the excursion			0
only later did i begin to ask myself what of my commentary had my counterpart judged to be @entity5 mythology rather than hard realism			1
distinguishing and dealing with the differences will be important in the upcoming negotiations			0
@entity176 , who has served as deputy director of @entity178 for me and @entity179 , had to do as much when he earlier negotiated the end of @entity183 's @entity182 program with a regime as vile and erratic as the @entity4			1
this is not to suggest that intelligence officials will actually conduct negotiations in this instance			0
@entity189 , @entity5 special envoy to @entity74 and @entity151 , brings as much talent , hard work and knowledge to the problem as anyone could			1
but i am suggesting that if these talks go forward , we will need a very deep understanding of the people across the table from us , people who when last in power imposed a hellish regime on their countrymen and who today have the blood of innocents on their hands			2
much of this will be distasteful , but even if the @entity4 are n't simply contemporary manifestations of @entity211 's darkest characters , is there enough common ground to get us to a conclusion we might not ideally desire but is at least what @entity215 has described in other circumstances as " @entity74 good enough ? " frankly , i do n't think there is , and intelligence agencies will have to have the courage to say so if this is the case			1
but we have decided to try and , if we are to have any chance of success , deep understanding of the human beings across the table from us , understanding anchored on near exquisite intelligence , will be essential			0
follow @entity230 on @entity231 join the conversation on @entity233 the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity236 .			1

@entity236 says talks with the @entity4 are going to be difficult , unlikely to succeed
he says it 's crucial to know as much as you can about the enemy in talks like these
odds of success in talks with @entity4 are diminished by @entity5 plans for *withdrawals* , he says
