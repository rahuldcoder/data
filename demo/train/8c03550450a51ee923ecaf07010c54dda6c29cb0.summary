editor 's note : @entity3 rep. @entity2 of @entity4 , the first openly gay man elected to the @entity5 as a freshman , is one of the subjects of the @entity9 series " @entity10 , " in which @entity2 and new rep. @entity11 , @entity12 , provide firsthand reports of political life			1
here , @entity2 ' partner , @entity16 , talks about the challenges and coping strategies of his own freshman year as a " congressional spouse " not usually encountered in @entity21			1
@entity16 , left , and rep. @entity2 talk			1
@entity16 says he has had difficulties as a " congressional spouse			1
" @entity21 ( @entity9 ) -- one of my heroes growing up was @entity28			1
my mom , an ardent baseball fan from whom i got my love of the game , had an old baseball card of his from the 1950s and told us his amazing story of courage in integrating baseball			2
years later , i read of the difficulty he faced as the first @entity42 major league baseball player -- people sliding in with their spikes up , pitchers beaning him , teammates shunning him			2
fortunately , the rapid pace of social progress has made it easier to break barriers than ever before , and although @entity53 is still far from representative of the population as a whole , the 111th @entity53 has record numbers of gay members , members of ethnic minorities and women			2
my partner , @entity16 , and i have been together for more than six years			1
we never saw ourselves or our relationship as anything different from those of other members of @entity53 , and while notable , the gender of my spouse has little to do with the overall experience of the congressional life and our " freshman year			1
" the life of a congressional spouse is harder than the life of the member			1
they do all the work and get none of the recognition			0
fortunately , @entity16 's passion for writing fiction is consistent with the necessary mobility of the congressional lifestyle and being able to work out of two homes			1
i am proud that @entity16 has chosen to tell his tale			1
@entity16 : to be a congressional spouse , one must be , above all else , flexible			1
so i was told when i arrived in d.c. 10 months ago			0
at the time of my introduction , i was something of a novelty among the spouses			2
at 28 years old , i was one of the youngest spouses in the @entity53			0
@entity2 is the second - youngest congressman			0
almost immediately , i was mistaken for a staff aide ; then again , for a son designated to attend in place of a spouse			2
more times than i care to remember , i was told , " but you 're so young ! " rarely has anyone seen me for what i actually am			0
i don my " @entity102 " lapel pin proudly and hope each time not to be questioned , yet i still receive sideways glances and orders to produce an official @entity105			2
it is as if my story is too unbelievable to be true , that i am an interloper , someone in a place i do not belong			0
perhaps this has to do with my being the partner of the first openly gay man to win a seat as a nonincumbent			2
i have noticed among those i meet a tincture of incredulity ; a reluctance to accept that which has not been seen before			1
@entity21 is a place steeped in traditions , some fine , others deplorable			1
both my partner and i , in many ways , are a challenge to the outdated notions that have reigned for so long			1
and just like those who arrive uninvited , from time to time , our experiences highlight differences rather than similarities			2
sometimes we are welcome ; other times , our presence seems to inspire resentment and tension			0
even among a group that is known for the unusual lifestyle of its members , ours seems to stand out			0
and yet , we are very much the same as any congressional family			0
we take time , when we have it , to enjoy dinners together , to play video games , to walk our new puppy and to celebrate life 's happy moments			1
like any couple working to make things right , we check in with each other to be sure it all has n't gotten to be too much			0
always on planes back and forth , contending often with feelings of displacement , we have our challenges			0
but still , there is a great deal to love in being an elected family			0
it is true that flexibility is the main ingredient in a successful congressional life			0
in many ways , we sacrifice what was once private for that which is , at times , painfully public			1
as much as we speak on behalf of our constituents , we are also a voice for the concerns of our @entity174 [ lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender ] community and democracy and freedom			0
i am excited to be here with @entity2 on the front lines , making history and fighting the good fight			0
it fills me again with hope when i remember that we are only the first in what will be a long line of openly @entity174 legislators ; people who come to serve our country rightfully and with the respect they deserve			0
each time we encounter injustice is an opportunity to be uncompromising , to prove a point , to not back down , but to pave the way			1
when , on the basis of our same - sex relationship , the military attempted to bar me from accompanying @entity2 on a congressional delegation to @entity200 , we fought and i triumphantly took my seat alongside the other spouses			0
when i was told by @entity203 that my lost @entity105 should never have read " spouse , " that the government recognizes me only as a " designee , " i prepared to fight -- but then found the original card			2
doubtless , these are but the opening acts of a years - long play about justice and the steady march of progress			0
for this , and for all we have to look forward to , i thank our constituents for the chance to change the world			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 and @entity16 .			1
