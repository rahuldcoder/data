with both teams already qualifying for the knockout stages , a @entity6 win would have seen them go through as group winners			2

defending champions @entity59 had already qualified for the knockout stages , but their run of poor form continued as they were thrashed 3 - 0 at @entity63 in @entity64 a @entity66 header and a @entity68 volley sealed the points for the @entity71 side , with @entity72 adding the third near the end			1
a victory would have seen @entity76 's side go through as group winners , but their heaviest defeat in @entity79 for five years allowed @entity80 to win the group on 11 points after a thrilling 3 - 3 draw at @entity84			1
an end - to - end encounter saw @entity80 go ahead when 40 - year - old goalkeeper @entity86 completely missed a @entity88 backpass , allowing the ball to dribble into the net			0
