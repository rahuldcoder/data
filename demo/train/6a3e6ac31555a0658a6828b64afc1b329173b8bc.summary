-- the woman 's voice wavered , just for a moment			2
standing feet from the @entity6 man who abducted her and chained her up in his @entity9 house , where for more than a decade she and two other women endured repeated beatings and rapes , she wiped away the tears and started again			2
" my name is @entity20 , and i would like to tell you what 11 years was like for me , " she told the judge thursday , delivering an emotionally charged statement that was remarkable for both its hope and defiance			1
for days , there had been speculation about whether @entity20 and the women held with her -- @entity20 and @entity20 -- would attend the sentencing hearing of @entity20 , who pleaded guilty last week to 937 counts in a deal that eliminated a possible death penalty in exchange for life in prison plus 1,000 years			1
@entity20 son : i wo n't visit dad in prison the speculation ended when the diminutive 32 - year - old @entity20 , wearing a gray dress and purple - framed eyeglasses , stood in the courtroom after she was called by the judge			1
it was the first time @entity20 had been in the same room with @entity20 since she was freed from 11 years of captivity on may 6 after neighbors heard @entity47 's cries and broke down a door			1
@entity20 stopped on her way to the front of the courtroom , hugging @entity47 's sister and @entity54 ' cousin who minutes earlier had read statements on behalf of the two women			1
" ... i worried about what would happen to me and the other girls every day , " @entity20 told judge @entity57 as she sobbed , wiping away tears			1

@entity20 has told the court he spotted her at a @entity73 and overheard her talking about needing a ride			1
unlike the abductions of @entity54 in august 2004 and @entity47 in 2003 , there was little made of her disappearance in the news			2
@entity20 's grandmother , @entity79 , told @entity80 in may , that the family had concluded that @entity20 had left of her own accord because she was angry that she had lost custody of her 2 - year - old son			1
that conclusion was supported by police and social workers , she told the newspaper			2
but the missing woman 's mother , @entity89 , told the newspaper that her daughter would never have broken all contact voluntarily			0

dna tests have confirmed that @entity20 is the father of the 6 - year - old			1
who are the three women freed in @entity9 ? in court thursday , @entity20 did not detail her abuse			1
but in a pre-sentencing evaluation , @entity118 -- considered a pioneer in trauma science -- told the court that @entity20 suffered " the longest and most severely " at the hands of @entity20			2
the evaluation -- using statements , medical records , videotaped interviews and transcripts -- painted a horrifying picture of physical and emotional abuse that included brutal beatings and repeated rapes that resulted in pregnancies that he would end by punching the women in the stomach			0
in one case , he threw @entity20 down the stairs to cause a spontaneous abortion			2
under threat of death by @entity20 , @entity20 was forced to deliver @entity47 's child , @entity118 said			2
" she served as doctor , nurse , pediatrician , midwife			0
she did it under primitive conditions			0
when that little baby was n't breathing , she breathed into the baby			0
she breathed life into that child , " @entity118 testified during the hearing			2
" she interposed herself so that @entity155 would n't get the assault , and she took it			0
she 's a very courageous and heroic individual			0
" @entity66 's statement @entity20 told the judge that @entity54 saved her life			1

she never let me fall , i never let her fall			0
she nursed me back to health when i was dying from his abuse , " she said			0
" my friendship with her was the only thing that was good out of this situation			0
we said we will someday make it out alive , and we did			0

you said , ' at least i did n't kill you , ' " she said			0
" you took 11 years of my life away , and now i 've got it back			1
i spent 11 years in hell , and now your hell is just beginning			1
" she never looked at @entity20 , who sat handcuffed at the defense table flanked by two attorneys			2
" i will overcome all this that happened			0
but you 'll face hell for eternity , " she said			2
" from this moment on , i will not let you define me or effect who i am			0
i will live on , you will die a little every day as you think about the 11 years and atrocities you inflicted on us			1
" she told him the " death penalty would be so much easier			0
" " you do n't deserve that , you deserve to spend life in prison			1
i can forgive you but i will never forget , " she said			0
as she neared the end of her statement , @entity20 was no longer crying			1
her voice was no longer wavering and breaking			0
it was strong and clear			0
" i know there ( are ) a lot of people going through hard times			0
