-- even terrorists have fears			1
and the prospect of gender equality appears to rank high on their list of worst nightmares			1
the logic , for them , is simple			1
empowered women would never accept the brutal ideology espoused by terrorist leaders as the rule of their land			1
educated women and girls would fundamentally challenge the power structure of organizations like @entity18			2
therefore , if you carry out the argument , they must be suppressed and enslaved			2
" there is no doubt that targeting of women is the core element -- not a byproduct -- of the ideologies espoused by these groups , " @entity21 , co-founder of the @entity22 , told us			2
so , any successful strategy against these groups must put women 's rights at the front and center of policy planning			1
this will require more than words or a few million dollars allocated to girls ' schools			2
it will demand a fundamental shake - up of @entity44 's foreign policy paradigm , on everything from aid to alliances			1
it will demand engaging women on the ground -- the women who are currently battling the nefarious organizations that are stripping them of their humanity			2
does any group or state that refuses to commit to working toward gender equality merit our money , weapons or political capital ? any entity that refuses to treat at least half of its population as equal to the other can not be expected to protect minorities and promote tolerance			1
in other words , the perpetuation of female oppression works against @entity44 interests and therefore should be a disqualification for @entity44 investment			1
after all , part of the reason @entity44 ostensibly invests and offers aid is to help nations to move closer to more inclusive and tolerant governance			1
the merits of building a foreign policy around the protection and empowerment of women and girls should be obvious from our own experience : progress on gender equality has been central to our own accession to true democracy ( though we still have a long way to go on the gender parity front )			1
it will similarly be key in any efforts to salvage areas that have become cesspools for extremist ideology			2
it is not a coincidence , after all , that some of the countries where women 's rights fare the worst also produce many jihadists for @entity103 and the @entity104			2
and in many of those countries , women 's rights are n't just stagnating , they 're backsliding			1
" although the battle over traditional gender roles is not new , the rise of religious extremism is ... halting and sometimes reversing the recent progress made on women 's rights and pushing women out of the public sphere , " according to an @entity117 policy brief from spring 2014 , which cites @entity119 , @entity120 , @entity121 , @entity122 and @entity123 as prime examples of the trend			1
the @entity127 's 2014 @entity126 backs up that assertion			2
the index ranks countries by performance in reducing the disparity in treatment and access between women and men			2
consistently , some of the worst ranked countries on the economic empowerment index -- and on the overall index -- ( @entity119 , @entity123 , @entity137 , @entity138 , @entity139 , @entity120 , @entity140 , @entity122 , @entity141 , @entity142 , @entity143 , @entity144 and @entity145 ) are also countries where extremism is on the rise and has in some cases already taken over the reins of power			2
" in parts of @entity145 , @entity161 , and the @entity162 , extremist groups have a greater impact on conditions on ground , and freedoms that people do or do n't enjoy , than the government does , " says @entity156 , vice president for analysis at @entity158			1
the question remains : why do these groups target women ? it all comes down to asserting control			0
often times , extremist groups are catering to disillusioned young men who , because of their unstable life circumstances , have been unable to marry , secure a job , provide for a family and thus assert their masculinity in traditional ways			0
hence , " the control over and subservience of women is part of the messaging and ideology that seems to resonate well " when recruiting men , @entity21 says			0
one of the first steps to domination is the control of information			0
just as the @entity195 were obsessed with burning books and exterminating any free - thinking group whose mere existence might be incompatible with its one - party fanaticism , @entity194 extremists are committed to shutting down any institution that allows for women 's education			0
in @entity139 , schoolgirls as young as 7 or 8 years of age have been threatened and shot by the @entity205 for going to school			0
in @entity208 , hundreds of women were abducted from their schools earlier this year			0
perhaps the most famous example is @entity212 winner @entity211 , the @entity144 girl who was the subject of an elaborate assassination plot as the @entity205 chose to make an example of her to instill fear into other activists for girls ' education			0
despite being shot in the head when her school bus was ambushed in 2012 , she survived			0
more recently , in the @entity223 and @entity224 parts of @entity161 that fell to @entity104 fighters , young women have been enslaved , and many now live the most tortured lives imaginable			0
on a recent @entity231 segment , we heard about a phone call that a @entity224 fighter received recently from an enslaved @entity223 woman			0
" if you know where we are please bomb us , " said the crying woman , who was living in a brothel			0
" there is no life after this			0
i 'm going to kill myself anyway -- others have killed themselves this morning			0
i 've been raped 30 times and it 's not even lunchtime			0
i ca n't go to the toilet			1
" the money that funded the rise of @entity18 and other terrorist organizations came from countries that we now claim are allies , but which embrace religious ideologies that are similar in theory , if not always as openly brutal in practice ( or at least on @entity257 videos ) as @entity18			1
@entity259 and @entity260 ideologies on the @entity262 side , and the @entity264 ' own brand of systematic suppression of female liberties , all prevail in the states that gave birth to extremist groups			0
it is hardly encouraging , in this context , to hear president @entity272 of @entity137 recently proclaim that women would never be equal to men -- this , right as the @entity276 was gearing up for a 16 - day campaign to bring awareness to violence against women worldwide ( the @entity276 estimates that a full third of women across the globe experienced acts of violence directed at their gender )			1
by aiding states that were actively supporting groups that merged with @entity18 , the @entity44 seems to have favored the short - term alignment of interests over the long - term alignment of principles			1
making progress on women 's rights should be a criterion for our aid and protection			0
the linkage between aid and progress is not new			0
@entity304 loans , for example , are already contingent on commitments to economic reform			0
and the @entity307 , an independent @entity44 foreign aid agency which is central in its role of setting policy , doles out aid based on various policy indicators , including civil liberties , child health and even girls ' primary education completion			1
but a stronger emphasis on progress towards gender equality would help clarify the importance this issue holds for the @entity44 , and perhaps inspire other global institutions to make gender equality a priority			1
at this critical time , it is vital that we react with clarity to the rise in brutality towards half of humanity			0
we must realize that only a policy that puts our money where our mouth is on the question of gender equality will effectively promote tolerance and stability			1
join us on @entity340 / @entity339 .			0

*authors* : terrorists in many nations oppose gender equality
they argue the @entity44 should orient its foreign policy to favor *pro-equality* regimes
nations that wo n't commit to that goal do n't deserve @entity44 money or weapons , they say
