-- sit ! shake ! quit barking ! get off the couch ! go find your toy ! ever wonder what your dog is thinking as it gazes at you while you are barking commands ? @entity8 's @entity7 in @entity9 , @entity10 , is one of the few labs in the country focused on how dogs think			1
" we 're excited about describing the psychology of our dogs , " says professor @entity14 , the lab 's director			1
" different dogs solve different problems differently			1
and what we want to understand is : what is it that either makes dogs remarkable as a species or what is it that constrains the ability of dogs to solve problems ? " to test the dogs ' ability , @entity14 and a team of graduate students put dogs through a variety of games similar to those you might play with young children			1
" we do n't want to look at cute pet tricks			0
what we want to know is , what does the dog understand about its world ? " @entity14 said			1
@entity14 has been analyzing our four - legged friends for about 15 years			1
he says dogs have figured out how to read human behavior and human gestures better than any other species has , even chimpanzees			0
" the way they think about their world is that people are superimportant and they can solve almost any problem if they rely on people , " says @entity14			1
children start relying on adults ' gestures when they 're about a year old			0
that 's about the same age that dogs start to recognize and rely on humans , too , @entity14 says			1
when both i and @entity14 tried to direct @entity66 to a cup that had a treat in it , @entity64 took his master 's cue and went toward the cup			1
i was a stranger to @entity64 , so the dog did n't rely on my information			0
" he 's grown up with me , " says @entity14			2
" we do lots of stuff together			0
he 's never met you before , so he 's saying , look , if they 're both telling me where to go , i 'm going to trust the guy who i 'm with all the time			0
" according to @entity14 , this proves dogs are complex social animals who understand they have different relationships with different people			1
" they really narrow in and pay attention to you and they want to know what it is about the world that you can help them with , " he says			0
researchers at @entity8 are studying dogs to better understand their limitations			1
if they can identify why dogs make mistakes , they believe they can help them improve			0
that could mean making dogs better at working with people with disabilities or better at working with the military			2
" they are a very different species and they think about the world differently than we do			0
and we need to figure out what are the constraints on how they solve problems , how is it that they think differently from us			0
and i think that we 're going to be able to have a much , even richer relationship with dogs than we already do if we figure all that out , " says @entity14			1
the professor says even though domestication has made dogs smarter , they are not perfect			1
still , they 're so smart , he says , that they can understand the principle of connectivity			2
" they know they 're connected on a leash and [ dogs reason ] ' well , now i have to listen , because if i do n't do what you say you can stop me			2
where if i 'm ... not on a leash , well , yeah , i know the command but i do n't have to listen to you now , ' " explains @entity14			2
and just like children , dogs also understand that if you turn your back , they can misbehave , especially after their owners have told them not to do something			2
" your dog takes the food you just told it not to take , and you 're really upset because your dog disobeyed you , and you think that your dog is not obedient			0
well , no , no , no , your dog was obedient but it realized that it could get away with it , " says @entity14			2
at the end of the day , dogs may rely on humans , but they also use their skills to manipulate their owners and the world they live in			0
and even though dog owners like to think they 're in command , the professor says it may actually be @entity162 who is really in charge			0

@entity14 and a team of graduate students at @entity8 study how dogs think
domestication has made dogs more intelligent , but they 're still not perfect , @entity14 says
dogs are social and understand the different relationships they have with different people
