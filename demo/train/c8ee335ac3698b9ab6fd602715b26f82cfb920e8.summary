-- there 's no cure for @entity3			1
so why have some patients walked away healthy while others in the @entity6 died ? dr. @entity7 , @entity8 and dr. @entity9 all contracted the disease while working in @entity11 -- and all survived			1
@entity15 nurse 's aide @entity13 got the virus while tending to stricken patients			2
but like the patients above , @entity18 and @entity15 priest @entity19 also received treatment in the @entity6			1
while there might not be a single , conclusive answer , a series of factors may contribute to survival			0
early , high - quality treatment this may be the most critical factor in beating @entity3			1
the survivors in the @entity32 all have one thing in common -- they were rushed to two of the country 's four hospitals that have been preparing for years to treat a highly infectious disease such as @entity3			1
@entity7 and @entity8 were successfully treated at @entity38 in @entity39 ; @entity9 was released from the @entity40 in @entity41			0
@entity18 did n't go to one of those four hospitals			2
he went to @entity44 in @entity45 with a fever and told them he 'd recently returned from @entity11			0
yet the hospital initially sent him home with antibiotics			0
then , after he returned to the hospital much more ill , two nurses became sick with the virus			0
they have since been moved to more specialized facilities such as @entity38 and the @entity54 in @entity55			1
but that does n't mean patients are doomed just because they go to a different hospital			1
" keep in mind that this is still a very deadly disease , " said dr. @entity59 , @entity0 's chief medical correspondent			1
" in @entity63 , the mortality rates are above 60 %			2
i think it is better in the @entity32			1
but they 're not going to be zero , i think no matter where somebody is			2
" @entity15 nurse 's aide found to be @entity3 - free in third test quick rehydration after finding a hospital capable of treating @entity3 , those who survive are usually rehydrated quickly			1
" the most important care of patients with @entity3 is to manage their fluids and electrolytes , to make sure that they do n't get dehydrated , " said dr. @entity75 , director of the @entity76			1
" and that requires some meticulous attention to detail and aggressive rehydration in many cases			0
" and if an infected patient getting proper care normally has a strong immune system , the chance of surviving goes up			0
but what may seem basic in the @entity32 can be difficult to come by in @entity63 , where @entity3 has already killed more than 4,500 people -- largely because access to health care is limited			1
yet @entity97 has successfully eradicated @entity3 from the country , the @entity96 said monday			1
unlike in @entity100 , @entity11 and @entity101 -- the combined epicenter of the oubreak -- all identified contacts in @entity97 were physically monitored every day for 21 days , @entity96 said			0
plasma transfusions three @entity3 patients -- @entity106 , @entity108 cameraman @entity107 and @entity110 nurse @entity109 -- all received plasma donations from @entity7			1
and all three have survived			2
the theory is that @entity7 's plasma contains the antibodies necessary to fight the virus			2
" it 's very fortunate that the three patients i 've been able to donate to , they and i share the same blood type , " @entity7 told @entity0 's @entity117			2
" i 'll keep doing it as much as it 's needed , as much as i can			0
" there was some controversy about why @entity7 did n't give plasma to @entity18			2
but the problem came down to blood type , @entity44 said			0
who to review @entity3 response amid criticism of its efforts experimental drugs medication that has n't gone through clinical trials can be risky			1
but with a mortality rate of 50 % in the current @entity3 outbreak , a @entity96 panel said it is ethical to offer drugs to fight the virus -- even if their effectiveness or adverse effects are unknown			1
the experimental drugs at the center of this @entity3 outbreak are @entity148 , @entity149 , @entity150 and @entity3			1
@entity7 and @entity8 both took @entity148 , and both survived			0
but @entity19 also took @entity148 , and he died			0
the director of @entity38 's @entity153 cautioned against viewing @entity148 as a surefire cure			0
" they are the very first individuals to have ever received this agent , " dr. @entity155 said			2
" there is no prior experience with it , and frankly , we do not know whether it helped them , whether it made no difference , or even , theoretically , if it delayed their recovery			0
" @entity15 nurse 's aide @entity13 took the anti-viral drug @entity169 and also received antibodies from a survivor in @entity63			2
she is now free of the virus			0
in addition to getting a blood transfusion , @entity9 received an experimental drug called @entity3 , which the @entity176 recently approved for wider use			1
@entity18 took a different untested drug , @entity150			0
but he did n't receive it until six days after being admitted to the @entity110 hospital			0
had he taken it earlier , the outcome might have been different			0
@entity0 's @entity183 , @entity184 , @entity185 and @entity186 contributed to this report .			0

three patients in the @entity32 have received plasma from another survivor
at least four in @entity6 survived after taking experimental drugs ; two died
early treatment at specialized facilities for @entity3 has *netted* *positive* results
but mortality rate wo n't be zero " no matter where somebody is , " dr. @entity59 says
