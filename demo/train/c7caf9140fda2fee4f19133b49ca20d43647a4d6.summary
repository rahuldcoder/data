-- it 's good to be @entity2 and @entity3 this weekend			1
the increasingly ubiquitous @entity2 , who recently told @entity0 that ride along is " my baby , " scored big with a $ 41.2 million opening weekend for the buddy - cop comedy			1
that should jump to an estimated $ 47.8 million when one factors in the monday @entity9 holiday			2
not only does the impressive haul surpass expectations for @entity13 's leanly budgeted $ 25 million comedy , but it also breaks the record for a january opening			1
( if you 're still not sold on the @entity19 , whose chemistry lifted the film to an " a " approval rating with @entity23 audiences , let this stupendous spot on @entity25 give you a taste of their chemistry			2
) @entity13 folks have further reason to thrust their chests out this weekend			1
buoyed by rapturous word of mouth , the studio 's real - @entity33 heart - thumper @entity35 dropped just 38 percent to deliver an impressive $ 23.2 million in its fourth weekend			1
director @entity37 , whose battleship bombed so badly , made @entity35 for $ 40 million and now can boast about a $ 74 million domestic total			1
sliding into the no. 3 spot is @entity41 ' animated @entity42			2
with families looking for holiday entertainment , @entity42 should swap places with @entity35 by the end of monday			1
the squirrel comedy , which earned a solid " b " rating from @entity23 audiences , managed to outperform its modest expectations			2
alas , the same ca n't be said for @entity51 's stab at rebooting its @entity53 franchise , with @entity55 actor @entity54 playing the action - hero @entity57 agent who 's previously been played by the likes of @entity60 and @entity61			2
@entity53 : @entity62 , which the studio made for $ 60 million , debuts at a rather limp no. 4 with just $ 17.2 million			2
a " b " @entity23 rating should n't do much to attract moviegoers distracted by all the @entity67 - nominated films they want to see before the big show			1
that said , @entity70 fared better overseas , with $ 22.2 million from only half of the international markets			0
@entity73 hung on in the no. 5 spot , with @entity76 's domestic kitty now totaling nearly $ 333 million			0
but hot on its heels was @entity79 , which earned 10 @entity67 nominations and last night walked away with a @entity82 award for best ensemble cast			0
@entity85 's caper , starring @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 , and @entity89 , enjoyed a 28 percent jump with a $ 10.6 million haul in its sixth weekend ; its total gross rose to $ 116.4 million			1
the @entity95 / @entity94 family drama august : @entity96 likewise enjoyed a jump in box office to $ 7.6 million as it more than doubled its theater count to 2,051 ; its cume stands at nearly $ 18.2 million			0
the only other other notable new release is @entity102 , @entity104 's found - footage horror movie that was hoping to benefit from its mega-viral " @entity106 " campaign			1
the film failed to crack the top 5 and earned a dismal " @entity23 rating			0
that 's a bleak showing , and yet the $ 7 million film already recouped its investment with an $ 8.5 million debut			0
the top five : 1			0
ride along — $ 41.2 million 2			0
@entity35 — $ 23.2 million 3			1
@entity42 — $ 20.55 million 4			0
@entity53 : @entity62 — $ 17.2 million 5			0
frozen — $ 12 million see the original story at @entity0			0
