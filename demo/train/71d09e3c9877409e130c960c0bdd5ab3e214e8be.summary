@entity0 may be the only country in the world where the food comes in bigger portions than on @entity5 plates			0
that 's particularly true when it comes to the carnivorous side of things			0
it 's meat by the wheelbarrow in the barbecue tradition known as churrascaria			1
the @entity15 barbecue tradition hails from the southern part of the country , from a gaucho technique of cooking meat in the wide - open country after a long day wrangling cattle			1
these days the wranglers come to you at the churrascaria , wielding skewers of meat from all manner of beast and bringing the cuts to your table one by one			1
there can be more than 20 different types of meat to choose from in the course of a meal at one of the big churrascarias			1
each skewer - toting server approaches with a particular cut			2
you inspect and nod , as if it was a bottle of wine , and the waiter then slices off a chunk for you to savor			0
when a couple of waiters vie for your taste buds , it looks like a fencing match will break out			0
it can get hectic on the churrascaria floor , but it 's worth it , because the slow - grilling @entity15 barbecue style known as rodizio produces some amazingly tasty food			1
it starts with a fanatical devotion to high - quality meat and special cuts			2
the hunks of meat are stabbed onto the skewer and then slow - roasted rotisserie - style over charcoal to lock in the juiciness and flavor			2
when the top layer of the meat is browned , it 's sliced off fresh to serve			2
the barbecuing is tailored to your individual tastes			0
you get not only a wide selection of cuts , but also styles : rare ( mal passado ) , medium rare ( a ponto para mal ) , medium ( a ponto ) , medium well ( a ponto para bem ) and well done ( bem passado )			0
the star of this meatapalooza is picanha , a top prime sirloin that melts in your mouth			1
but there 's a big supporting cast -- alcatra ( top sirloin ) , baby beef , filet mignon , file com alho ( filet mignon with garlic ) , maminha ( rump steak ) , @entity93 ( beef short ribs ) , and pork loin , sausage , chicken and plenty more			1
gallery : a look at @entity0 's best beaches top 5 @entity15 barbecue cuts @entity103 the hands - down favorite for @entity0 is picanha , a rump cut that 's sliced in thin sheets and eaten with rice and beans			1
for anyone who wants to experience the @entity15 barbecue tradition , picanha is a must			1
the meat comes from the top of the rump , the rump cap , which has two sides , one that 's better known as tri-tip and the other smaller side , which is picanha			1
@entity0 grill slabs of picanha with the fat on , and slice it off before serving			2
good picanha is juicy , tender and triggers taste buds to demand more			2
it 's a premium cut , juicy , tender and out of the normal steak experience			0
keep the slices modest and you 'll be able to get up from the chair after the feast			0
baby beef known by the @entity5 handle ( pronounced " bebe beefey " ) , baby beef is the second most popular cut in @entity0 , just back of picanha			0
it 's seen as a delicacy and is priced accordingly , the most expensive of the churrascaria cuts			0
baby beef , as the name implies , comes from younger cows , though not as young as veal cows			0
the savory meat comes from the tenderloin section and is more tender and lean than that of mature cows , which is a big attraction for @entity15 palates			1
it 's a super-tasty cut , but will set your wallet back a bit			0
@entity159 ( top sirloin ) @entity159 is a top sirloin cut that 's a traditional dish in @entity163 homes , served as a kind of pot roast , but the @entity0 reinvented it on the grill to create a flavorful style of sirloin			2
the right seasoning , grilling and smoky flavoring gives this tender cut a flavor and tenderness you wo n't be able to stop thinking about			0
it 's a whole new slice of sirloin			0
filet mignon the king of the steaks is part of a pantheon in the @entity15 barbecue universe			1
it 's still a favorite , but has competition from picanha and baby beef			0
the great thing about the churrascaria style , though , is that you 're not restricted to one slab of meat			2
you can have a couple slices of picanha , filet mignon and more , depending on how many extra belt loops you have			0
known for its lack of fat and tenderness , filet mignon can be exquisite in the hands of a great churrascaria chef			0
@entity202 ( pork loin ) it 's not all beef at the churrascaria , where pork , lamb , chicken and even fish are also on the menu			1
@entity202 is a pork cut worth sampling			1
the loin is sliced into slabs for the skewer dressed in a parmesan cheese coating			1
as is done with the beef , only the best cuts of loin make it to the grill , so the pork is as juicy and tender as the high - end beef cuts			2
