-- @entity2 intelligence knows him simply as @entity4			1
but his full name is @entity6 , and he is regarded as one of the most dangerous commanders in the @entity10 terror group @entity9			1
@entity12 officials say @entity13 was the target of a raid saturday by @entity16 on an @entity9 compound near the town of @entity19 in @entity10			1
it 's believed that he escaped after the @entity12 troops came under heavy fire			1
@entity13 , thought to be in his late 20s , is wanted by both the @entity2 government and its @entity27 allies and was a close associate of one of @entity31 's most important operatives in @entity32			1
a recent @entity2 intelligence report that was leaked just after the westgate mall attack in @entity35 outlined several plots in which he was allegedly involved			1
all of them involved targets in @entity2 , and all the attacks would have involved @entity2 citizens trained by @entity9			1
among those conspiracies , according to the leaked report , was a planned attack on @entity45 in @entity2 's @entity46			1
@entity13 was " directing an attack targeted at @entity45 between 25th and 28th april 2013 , " according to the report			0
he was " being assisted by @entity51 , an @entity9 explosive expert , " and the attack would have involved 11 terrorists			2
wife : terror suspect had left @entity31 another plot -- in 2011 -- involved dispatching one operative to a safe house in @entity35 whose mission was " to train youth , lay down the infrastructure for a major attack and await instructions			2
" that individual was later arrested at a house said to have contained grenades , rifles and ammunition			0
the @entity2 report also alleged that one of @entity4 's most ambitious conspiracies had been sanctioned by @entity31 in @entity70			1
it envisioned multiple attacks in @entity2 at the end of 2011 and in early 2012 targeting the @entity2 parliament , @entity76 offices in @entity35 and @entity2 politicians			2
there was also " financial and logistical support from a @entity81 facilitation network			0
" it 's not clear whether @entity13 had any role in the @entity86 attack , but given the involvement of some @entity88 in the siege , it seems likely			2
@entity13 has been at the forefront of @entity9 's efforts to recruit and train @entity88 and other foreigners for @entity9 -- and to develop a @entity2 affiliate called @entity94			1
@entity95 ' ruthless ' , ' secretive ' @entity2 officials have said that he regularly traveled between @entity10 and @entity2 , and was in @entity2 at one point last year			1
at least one of the plots he directed involved @entity81			0
sources say @entity13 regularly changes his appearance -- at one point having very long hair , and at another a moustache similar to former @entity105 leader @entity104 's			0
@entity106 , a former informant who has worked for several @entity27 intelligence agencies , has told @entity0 that he developed a close relationship with an @entity9 figure called @entity4 between 2008 and 2012			1
he said he is confident that it 's the same person who was targeted over the weekend			0
storm , who is @entity113 , described @entity13 as a @entity10 - @entity2 @entity9 operative who had spent time in @entity116			1
he said that @entity13 made clear to him via e-mail that he was ready to send recruits from the @entity119 back home from @entity10 to launch attacks			0
@entity116 journalist @entity122 told @entity0 his sources have confirmed that @entity124 had indeed spent time in @entity116 and had tried to recruit for @entity9 in @entity126			1
@entity122 , who reports on security and terrorism for @entity129 , said @entity13 had lived there between 2004 and 2008			0
he had failed to gain asylum status but had been given @entity116 travel papers			0
@entity122 told @entity0 that according to his sources , @entity13 had traveled to @entity10 while living in @entity116 and had used about a dozen aliases			0
" there was a connection to @entity4 in a court case in @entity137 of two @entity137 nationals of @entity10 descent who were accused of participating in terrorist training in @entity10 , " @entity122 said			1
" there was phone surveillance introduced as evidence in the trial in which the two men discussed @entity4			2
they spoke of him as their contact when they arrived in @entity2 from @entity137 , " he said			2
@entity150 : how @entity9 picks its targets storm , who no longer works underground , has shown @entity0 encrypted e-mails he exchanged with @entity13 over a period of several years			2
those communications show that @entity13 was involved in developing contacts between members of @entity9 and @entity160 ( @entity160 ) , across the @entity161 in @entity162			2
they included contacts between @entity4 and the @entity12 - born cleric @entity165 , who was killed in a @entity12 missile attack in september 2011			2
this relationship was a source of great concern to @entity27 intelligence agencies as it evolved in 2009 - 11 , because it linked the most active and dangerous @entity31 affiliate -- @entity160 -- with an emerging terror group in @entity10 , a country with an extremely weak government			1
one e-mail from @entity165 to storm , dated december 12 , 2009 , said : " the brs ( brothers ) here eagerly want to establish connections with @entity10 so these brs could be a start , " a reference to @entity4 and others			2
storm replied : " @entity13 from @entity10 is still waiting for your questions , he just told me , that he is planning to come over to your place with some other guys			0
" it 's not over , @entity10 terrorists say after mall attack that killed 67 @entity13 established contact with @entity165 but never ended up making the trip to meet him in @entity162 , according to @entity186			0
instead , he stayed in @entity32 , traveling between @entity2 and @entity10 , and becoming a key handler for foreigners , including @entity119 who wanted to join @entity9 , @entity186 said			1
in march 2012 , @entity13 warned storm of growing pressure from the @entity2 security apparatus			2
" so you need to be extra carefull ( sic ) they dont get a single trace of anything coz they are now tracing a sister who was a widow of one of the london 7/7 bomber , " he wrote , a reference to @entity200 , who is believed still to be in @entity2 and is wanted by @entity2 authorities			1
storm told @entity0 that in 2012 , he was offered a substantial sum to help @entity27 intelligence agencies find @entity13 , known to his handlers at that point as @entity216			0
he said @entity13 was in @entity217 , @entity10 , when they last communicated in mid- 2012 , shortly before @entity2 forces pushed @entity9 out of the port city			1
one of @entity13 's associates was @entity222 , who was detained by the @entity12 military while crossing by sea from @entity162 to @entity10 in april 2011			0
@entity225 had been involved in establishing training and weapons transfers with @entity160			0
another close associate of @entity124 , according to @entity186 , was @entity229 , an @entity12 @entity9 operative still at large			0
the @entity12 has offered a $ 5 million reward for information leading to his capture			0
intelligence sources say @entity13 is thought to have first gone to @entity10 in 2006 and subsequently worked for two @entity88 prominent in @entity9 and @entity31 : @entity235 and @entity236			1
@entity236 was a senior @entity2 @entity31 operative , and he was among the @entity12 government 's most wanted terrorists			1
he was suspected of helping to orchestrate the 1998 @entity240 bombings , a 2002 bombing on a @entity243 resort , and a near simultaneous failed missile attack on an @entity246 airliner taking off from @entity243 's airport			0
@entity13 became one of his trusted insiders , according to @entity186			0
@entity236 was killed in a raid by @entity12 special operations forces on a convoy traveling south along @entity10 's coastal road in september 2009			0
a younger relative of @entity236 , @entity256 , was among the gunmen killed at @entity86 , @entity2 authorities say			0
if @entity13 survived the weekend attack by @entity12 special operations forces and is able to continue operating , @entity2 authorities will be concerned about his ability to continue developing @entity94 cells in the slums of @entity35 and @entity243 , @entity2			0
a @entity2 expert on the group , @entity264 , tells @entity0 that @entity2 security services have driven @entity94 underground but in the process made the group more unpredictable and dangerous			0
@entity264 says he was made aware in 2011 of a camp in @entity2 's @entity269 used by @entity9 as staging ground for recruits going to @entity10			1
@entity264 says that in @entity2 , there is more radicalization among young @entity88 than among the sizable @entity10 community			0
that in part may be down to the activities of @entity4 , aka @entity6 .			1

@entity6 was target of raid saturday by @entity16 , officials say
the @entity9 commander , also called @entity4 , is thought to have escaped
he 's wanted by @entity2 and its @entity27 allies , accused of involvement in terror plots
he 's suspected of leading efforts to recruit and train foreigners for @entity9
