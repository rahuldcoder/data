-- the @entity2 royal family has a long history with the sea			1
@entity6 's much beloved @entity5 carried members of the monarchy on almost 1000 official voyages over 44 years , from her launch in 1953 to her decommissioning in 1997			1
her majesty was seen wiping a tear away at the farewell ceremony for @entity5 , which was launched in 1953 with a dual purpose - to provide royal travel around the @entity17 and to act as a hospital ship in time of war			1
now @entity2 media reports that conservative member of parliament @entity21 has suggested the @entity6 should be given a new yacht to mark this year 's diamond jubilee			1
what would go into designing a yacht fit for the @entity6 ? we ask some yacht designers what they would do if they received the commission of a lifetime			1
a " timeless " creation " any royal yacht is around for some time , " says @entity34			1
" it needs to be timeless and look as good in ten years time as it did on its launch			1
" the yacht designer would draw on the last @entity5 as a source of inspiration for a new royal yacht			1
he says a highlight of the vessel is its " beautiful " proportions which he would replicate for his own creation			2
" it should embody the elegance of the old @entity5 , but equally it could be a little bit daring , " adds @entity47			0
but while taking inspiration from the 125 meter yacht , the designer insists it should not be a copy			1
" a new royal yacht should n't be conventional , " he says			2
" but it should n't have any ' trendy ' solutions , it needs to be quite distinguished			0
" flexibility is essential for a head of state 's yacht according to @entity47			1
from official tours of the @entity17 to honeymoons , the last @entity5 was used for a range of activities			0
@entity47 would design large spaces that can be opened up when entertaining , and closed in with glass when the weather commands			0
" it has to be a little bit of a transformer , " he continues			0
" the area needs to be used all year around in all temperatures , from the warm @entity73 to the cooler northern waters near @entity75			2
" royal superyachts : how kings and queens sail the sea it 's not all business for the royals , and @entity34 says he 'd take into account the more intimate occasions when creating spaces , allowing a banquet room to be converted into smaller family areas			2
" people should melt " @entity89 wants onlookers to be captivated by any royal yacht he would design			2
" people should melt when they see it , " the designer says			0
" it should immediately send out a message			0
" @entity89 would take into consideration the role a royal vessel plays when designing one			0
he says the boat is a great tool to promote the country and grab people 's attention , whether they are heads of state , captains of industry or fundraisers			2
" it 's a great way to get people together to sell a message -- no one could turn down an invitation to the royal yacht			1
" @entity89 says the yacht must display the best of local talent -- technically perfect so it can " show off @entity2 's capabilities " and modern			1
but @entity89 says any futuristic design should not include " wacky " features			0
" it ca n't be too much about the fashion			0
" the cost - savvy approach in times of austerity , questions would be raised over the cost of any new royal yacht at the expense of the taxpayers			1
with that in mind @entity130 believes he has the solution for any penny - pinching royal -- buy second - hand			2
@entity136 : @entity138 's oldest warship to get $ 25m facelift " in the current market , it 's so much cheaper to buy an existing yacht and re-fit and condition it , " says @entity130			1
he thinks a complete interior overhaul and a good paint job would suffice			0
but @entity130 insists that does not mean that style would be compromised			0
" extravagant areas could be done with more lavish woods , " he explains			0
" the outside should be modern but i do n't think the royal family would go for a highly modern interior , it would have to be traditional , " says the designer who thinks furnishing should be classic with a slight modern twist such as simple mouldings made out of wood			0
@entity130 also highlights the need for flexibility			0
" i would have large vip guest cabins where bulkheads could be cut off so it could be broken off into two or three rooms if need be			0
" but if the @entity6 did not want a pre-loved model , @entity130 believes there 's never been a better time to commission a yacht with an industry facing tough economic challenges ; the royal is more likely to get more for her pound .			1
