@entity0 -- social media lit up wednesday with reactions to vice president @entity4 's off - the - cuff remarks about fending off a would - be home intruder			1
but unlike most debates about gun control , on which @entity4 is leading a @entity11 task force , the online commentary largely centered on the advice he apparently once gave his wife			1
" i said , @entity18 , if there 's ever a problem just walk out on the balcony here ... put that double - barreled shotgun and fire two blasts outside the house , " @entity4 said during an online question - and - answer session tuesday			1
his comments were likely intended to underscore the position that shotguns were sufficient for self - defense , rather than high - capacity or semi-automatic weapons like the @entity32			1
but they also unleashed a torrent of online reaction after conjuring up the image of @entity37 hypothetically firing off rounds outside the vice president 's home in @entity41			2
" so when the cops come to arrest me for shooting off the porch , i can tell ' em @entity4 said it 's ok , " wrote one online user			1
" the scariest part about his whole statement is that he is encouraging people to blindly fire off rounds at unknown noises and in unknown directions , " said another			0
@entity53 ramps up campaign against proposed gun control measures the @entity57 administration has called on @entity58 to reinstate an assault weapons ban that expired in 2004 , to restrict ammunition magazines to no more than 10 rounds , and to expand background checks to anyone buying a gun			1
but the @entity11 has met stiff opposition from congressional @entity66 and the @entity53 , a powerful lobby group that opposes new regulations governing firearms			0
" you do n't need an @entity32 , " said @entity4 in the online forum			2
" it 's harder to aim			0
it 's harder to use			0
and , in fact , you do n't need 30 rounds to protect yourself			0
" online commentary was mixed in response			0
" an @entity32 ( is ) easier to shoot than a shotgun , there 's less recoil in a .223 than a 12 gauge , " wrote one online user			1
" a shotgun is not for everybody			0
even in smaller ( gauges ) , the recoil is too much for many people , and buckshot is n't nearly as precise as a rifle shot , " wrote another			0
@entity57 : overcoming violence hard , but can be done others hailed the benefits of a shotgun because " it does n't need to be aimed precisely " and that " one or two shots should do the trick			2
" " it 's safer than pistols re : accidents at home , especially involving children , " wrote one user			2
" unfortunately , there are too many gun nuts out there w / vivid imaginations ... who lie awake at night thinking up imaginary dangers			0
" in the online chat , @entity4 said he does not favor constitutional amendments to adjust the @entity111 , which is cited by both proponents of and those opposed to new gun regulations			1
but , he said , the @entity119 " does allow the government to conclude that there are certain types of weapons that no one can legally own			0
" the limits are imposed for " public safety , " @entity4 said			2
@entity11 press secretary @entity122 said wednesday the nation needs to take sensible , common sense action to try to reduce " the scourge of gun violence in this country			0
" he declined to further comment on @entity4 's remarks , though he added that the vice president is a law - abiding gun owner who has both a 12 - gauge and 20 - gauge shotgun locked up in a safe in his @entity41 home			1
the @entity57 administration has been pressing for gun reforms since the december massacre at @entity137 in @entity138 , @entity139 , where an ar - 15 - wielding gunman killed six adults and 20 children between the ages of 6 and 7			1
