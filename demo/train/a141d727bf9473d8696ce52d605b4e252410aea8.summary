@entity0 -- @entity3 ground commanders in @entity4 say they need help , fast			1
that 's not a request for more troops , but a request from commanders who say the current camouflage uniform is not blending well in the diverse countryside			1
@entity3 commanders in @entity4 say the current uniform does not blend well in the countryside			1
in response , the @entity3 later this month will field - test two new camouflage color schemes and patterns on about 1,000 soldiers in @entity4 , where the terrain is extremely varied			1
commanders have had problems there because of the numerous changes in environments a soldier can move in and out of in a short period of time -- from woodland to desert to alpine , and to rocky and snowy mountain tops			0
the current uniform , known as the @entity33 or @entity33 , has lighter shades of green and tan , which some commanders have complained does not blend well if soldiers need to stay motionless on a mission , as snipers or reconnaissance troops must			1
the effort by the @entity3 was recently accelerated , according to @entity3 officials , after @entity44 rep. @entity43 , @entity45 , told the @entity3 he had a number of complaints from soldiers in @entity4 who said the current camouflage pattern was not effective in the mountainous regions			1
two yet - to - be - identified battalions -- a battalion has about 500 troops -- will test the two patterns , with initial results being turned into @entity3 researchers by the end of october			2
while deployed , all 1,000 soldiers will have their regularly issued acus			0
in addition , one battalion will also get one of the new camouflage uniforms with a test pattern known as " @entity65			0
" the pattern is made up of numerous blobs of white , brown , tan , black and greens for a more woodland look , and is already being worn by snipers and special operations forces			0
the other brigade will test a similar pattern to the @entity33 , called the @entity75 or " @entity76			0
" while the pattern is the same , a series of " digitized " blocks of green and tan , the test uniform adds what he @entity3 calls " coyote brown " and a slight color darkening all around to the greens and tans			2
the look is also designed to blend in the woods			0
both battalions will be based in eastern @entity4 where the terrain is the most rugged and diverse , @entity3 officials said			0
the @entity3 hopes to have the field input and a decision on what pattern is best by the end of january 2010 and the fielding of the new uniform as early as june 2010			1
troops will still keep the existing @entity33 , and commanders will be able to decide mission by mission what the soldiers should wear , according to @entity3 officials			0
the testing is part of the @entity3 's long - term development of a permanent alternative to the current @entity33 , according to @entity3 officials .			2
