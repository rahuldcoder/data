@entity19 - @entity18 and an honorary doctor of science from @entity21 , sees three new frontiers of exploration : the tropical rainforest canopy , which researchers are beginning to access by hot air balloon and which is teeming with new species ; caves ( only 10 % of the world 's caves have been discovered ) ; and coral reefs , which are revealing more of their secrets thanks to smart technology			1
the key to exploring these new frontiers is science			1

" he 's not suggesting it 's easy to make the leap from tourist to explorer , but it 's possible if you 're smart about it			1
first , you have to know what you 're talking about , which means reading as much as you can about your chosen destination			2

how to become an explorer @entity19 - @entity6 says many of the world 's research centers will open their doors if you approach them in the right way			1
" if you want to be an explorer , go to one of these research stations , they have amazing ones in @entity92 , and say , ' i 'll sweep the laboratory floor but can i come back when you look for the giant otters and i 'll paddle the boat			0
" some wannabe explorers yearn for the days when the world was a pristine planet and great @entity100 explorers such as @entity101 and @entity102 went off on journeys and returned with mountains of exciting new material and stories			0
but @entity6 says there 's much more of the @entity76 left to explore and species to discover and that the mission is more important now than ever			1
" it does n't matter if people have been there before , it is n't about being the first -- it 's about understanding and learning more about it			2
