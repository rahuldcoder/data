-- we do n't use the f - word in my family			1
and by @entity5 , i 'm not talking about the f - bombs , because those get dropped from time to time			1
i 'm talking about the word " fat			0
" the word is banned from my house with the same vigilance that racist language would not be tolerated			0
extreme , perhaps , but i have a husband who went through a chubby stage and still bears the scars of his prepubescent ridicule			0
i also have two tween children with very different body types and low thresholds for teasing			2
mention weight or body shape among my family and the reaction can be nuclear , unleashing a tsunami of tears , screams and " i hate you ! " extreme body awareness and the barf - starve - smoke - yourself - to - thinness regimen is hardly new for teenagers and young women			1
but the age at which the obsession is starting seems to be creeping even younger			0
today , according to the @entity32 at @entity33 , more than 40 % of all 9 - and 10 - year - old girls have already been on a diet			1
the @entity36 reports that 40 - 60 % of children between ages 6 and 12 are worried about their weight and 70 % want to slim down			1
maybe this is n't so surprising given the aggressively narrow proportions in girls ' clothing these days in trendy skinny jeans , @entity47 leggings and unforgiving clingy tops that are all the rage among the under - 12 set			1
it 's no wonder that young girls are more aware than ever of their own mini-muffin tops or " baby fat " as grandmas call it			0
compound clothes with the omnipresent camera phone , photo stream and " selfies , " and it 's a recipe ripe for self - loathing			2
we know that there is a very real childhood obesity epidemic in this country plaguing entire communities and it is one of the most significant health issues of our time			0
our snack food nation is chock full of overstuffed soda - coma kids who play outside less and eat more			1
according to the @entity77 , in 2010 , more than one - third of children and teenagers in the @entity76 were overweight or obese			1
it 's a national crisis that everyone from first lady @entity81 on down seems intent on tackling			0
in fact , my daughter 's elementary school participated in an amped - up fitness program this year			1
the program included cardio and flexibility tests , weighing the children and taking a body mass index			2
the results were printed with color - coded columns that red - flagged danger zones for kids at risk in various categories			1
i happened to walk into the school on a morning when some fourth - grade girls were being herded into a corner next to a scale and weighed by the physical education teacher , who then typed the children 's weight into a laptop			1
as the girls waited to be weighed , some looked like they were about to burst into tears and others like they were going to throw up			2
one of the tiniest girls in the grade stood next to one of the largest , in a painfully awkward scene that seemed stolen from a @entity116 novel			1
for the next few days the chatter among the girls was " what do you weigh ? " my daughter came home stressed ; she , like many of the girls , did n't want to share her weight or even step on a scale			2
the whole ordeal was mortifying , even among a group of average - sized girls			2
i told my daughter she did n't need to tell anyone her weight , and if pushed , i said she could lie			2
having just been to the pediatrician for my daughter 's annual physical , she and i knew exactly what she weighed and that she was perfectly healthy			1
but the number on the scale startled her			0
on the cusp of puberty , many of the girls ' bodies are changing , and emotionally they are more fragile than ever			0
i told our school principal that i did n't want my daughter weighed			1
even at age 9 or 10 , regardless of the number on the scale , it just felt like a public shaming			0
" we 're very concerned about some of the children 's anti-obesity programs and messaging that 's happening now , " said @entity148 , manager of the @entity36 's @entity150 program			1
" they are well intentioned , of course , but when the focus is on @entity158 as an indicator of health and when kids are getting weighed at school and comparing notes , it can really be a trigger for kids who are already feeling vulnerable			1
there is research out there that these programs may be backfiring			0
the kids are coming home more anxious			2
the goal is to shift the conversation away from @entity158 and talk about what makes your body feel good			1
" a few years ago there was a public outcry when @entity179 documented in @entity180 the severe diet she put her 7 - year - old daughter on			2
the article was part confessional about @entity179 ' own body issues and struggle with food , as well as her yearlong quest to slim down her daughter			2
@entity179 got the mother lode of scorn heaped on her by the blogosphere and even the media			0
but after @entity179 learned that her daughter was obese at 6 years old standing 4 feet 4 inches and weighing 93 pounds , did n't she have to take some serious intervention ? my daughter enjoys a good meal , especially if mac and cheese is on the menu			2
so when she went to sleepaway camp at 8 years old , i had prepped her ahead of time about making healthy food choices : make sure to eat lots of fruit and drink plenty of water			1
stay away from all the white and creamy ranch salad dressings			0
choose the clear ones that look like vinaigrette , i told her			0
one of the first letters she sent home that summer was all about what she ate for dinner			0
" mommy you 'll be so proud of me , i did n't eat the white dressing			0
i ate the clear one ! " she wrote			0
the letter had me laughing and a little worried			0
at 8 years old , had i started the beginning of a life - long eating disorder or am i just making for a conscientious and healthy eater ? " as parents you have to set boundaries but you do n't want to make certain foods off limits or shameful			1
you also do n't want to set it up that every time you have the chocolate cake that it 's indulgent or sinful , " @entity148 said			0
" we do n't want kids thinking about calories or fat grams and stoking that fear			0
and shame is not a motivator of healthy behavior			0
" some children hit the genetic lottery and do n't have to worry about their metabolism or weight , but many more , boys included , feel the embarrassment of being the bigger kid			1
experts say that the key for parents is to not obsess about the number on the scale and also to look at their own attitudes about food and weight			1
if every time you walk by the mirror you 're scrutinizing yourself , you 're sending a dangerous message to your own children			0
" weight is a fear that so many parents have			0
but we have to shift the focus away from weight and @entity158			1
it 's less about making sure kids do n't get fat or that fat kids get thin , " @entity148 said			0
" the conversation should be about how can we make all kids healthy and feel good about themselves			1

@entity273 wonders how to create healthy food habits for her kids
40 - 60 % of children between ages 6 and 12 are worried about their weight
when kids were weighed at school it seemed like a scene " from a @entity116 novel "
@entity36 : " shift the focus away from weight and @entity158 "
