@entity0 is rarely out of the headlines these days -- often for controversial reasons -- but does that mean it should be avoided by tourists ? since the collapse of the @entity10 the country 's status as a travel destination has grown steadily , with visitors drawn as much by the spectacular architecture and history of @entity14 and @entity15 , as by the people and rich culture			1
however , recent events in @entity19 and the @entity21 region have dealt a blow to this popularity , and could spell further trouble for @entity0 's tourism industry in 2015			1
ironically , with the ruble taking a significant hit after the @entity29 slapped sanctions on @entity14 following the annexation of @entity21 and tensions in eastern @entity19 , there 's seldom been a cheaper time to go for visitors from many countries			1
but will they go ? and , crucially , should they ? indications so far suggest that 2015 will be another tough year for the @entity39 tourism industry			1
in the past , @entity0 's biggest source of visitors has been former @entity10 states -- chiefly @entity19			1
" @entity19 is by far @entity0 's largest foreign market			1
last year , tourism from that country into @entity0 plunged 43 % , " says @entity44 , an analyst for the @entity46 - based @entity45			1
it 's a situation mirrored across other former @entity51 countries			2
" traditionally , these visitors have traveled to @entity0 by road , which is a cheaper route than flying			1
but many roads to @entity0 from @entity55 go through @entity19 , which were shut down because of the conflict			1
" beyond the region , tourism from @entity58 , the @entity59 and @entity60 experienced the most significant drops -- trends @entity44 says are likely to continue in coming years			0
" the political situation between @entity0 and the @entity67 remains difficult , which affects the economy of @entity0 in a negative way , " says @entity64 , managing director of @entity14 - based destination management company @entity65			1
" needless to say that @entity0 is currently not a popular destination to travel to for many countries there			2
" @entity0 's rail and river voyages -- usually a strong draw for tourists -- have seen a decline in interest for 2015 excursions			1
according to @entity80 , director of sales and marketing for @entity14 - based @entity82 , bookings are down by up to 40 % , partly due to a backlash against @entity0 's recent actions			1
" business from all @entity87 countries has been affected in one way or the other , " he says			0
" whereas six months ago that drop down may have been mainly driven by safety concerns , now they are mostly of a political and emotional nature			0
" there are no major @entity87 travel advisories warning against visiting @entity0 beyond its border regions with @entity19 and regions that have previously been beset by troubles such as @entity98 and @entity99			1
the @entity59 @entity101 and @entity102 website notes on @entity0 : " most visits are trouble free			2
" there 's a more cautionary message from the @entity106 , which expresses concern about sporadic terrorist incidents , crime , harassment and demonstrations -- but there 's no explicit warning to stay away			0
@entity114 is the marketing manager for @entity115 , a @entity58 tour operator running the @entity117 's @entity116 between @entity14 and @entity118			0
he says the @entity21 crisis initially failed to dent business when it broke out in march			2
since there were no travel warnings , few people canceled			0
" nevertheless , only a few new bookings came in after april for the rest of the season -- 2014 was n't the best year , but still , it was better than our forecasts for 2015			2
" @entity114 says his company still plans to run its full schedule of trans - siberian trains , even though advance bookings are already down 30 %			0
@entity60 tour operators have experienced similar booking trends			0
@entity136 is the co-owner of @entity137 , a @entity60 - based company with long roots in @entity0			2
at this time last year , @entity139 thought that 2014 was looking to be a strong year for tourism to @entity0			1
while events in @entity21 did n't lead to cancellations of trips already booked , there was a drop in future demand			2
she says those who pulled out did so because they " were not thrilled with the notion of what was going on , and they made their decisions based on that rather than personal security issues			0
" another barometer of falling demand is a cutback of 2015 tour departures by international operators			0
river cruise companies @entity162 and @entity164 are cutting capacity , while @entity166 has pulled out of @entity0 altogether			2
for @entity166 president @entity167 , it 's partly a matter of economics and partly a matter of emotion			0
" i 'm the first to admit that this is both a personal and a business decision , " he says			0
" one of my concerns is what the economic situation will be in the future			0
" if there 's another conflict , or if trade sanctions are being imposed , we do n't want to provide support to the regime			0
" economic factors are also at play , @entity167 adds			0
" with the rapid decline of the ruble , it 's extremely costly to bring in goods to @entity0 , " he says			1
" so , we can not guarantee that we can import the quality of goods and employ the right people to provide our passengers with the level of luxury they are used to			0
" business travel has also been hit , although the news is n't all bad			0
despite the recent downturn , @entity198 is emerging as a potential growth market for @entity0 in terms of both business and leisure travel			2
" @entity198 countries tend to be less sensitive to the politics , " says @entity0 's @entity64			1
" the same we hear from hoteliers : as the number of @entity210 goes down , the number of @entity198 increases			0
as a result , our focus will move from the @entity29 to the @entity213			0
" outside of former @entity10 states , @entity214 is @entity0 's largest and fastest - growing international inbound market			1
according to @entity45 's @entity44 : " out of the top inbound countries , @entity214 was the only one to increase last year			1
as a result , @entity0 's national tourist agency has been making a strategic switch from @entity29 to @entity213 in the last few months			1
" in part , it 's doing so by making visas easier to obtain , especially for @entity214 groups heading to @entity21			1
those groups are needed to fill the empty rooms left by the decline of @entity19 vacationers , who previously made up 70 % of @entity21 's tourism market , according to @entity44			1
fueled by marketing efforts , easing of visa restrictions , and by the increased buying power of the yuan versus the ruble , business from @entity214 is expected to be up at least 10 % in 2015			2
if @entity87 do venture to @entity0 this year , they may discover that it 's actually a good time to go			1
although @entity162 has dry docked a portion of its @entity39 fleet , @entity236 , senior vice president of marketing , points out that " 2015 may actually be the best time to visit @entity0			1
it certainly wo n't be as crowded , and prices are down due to shrinking demand and favorable exchange rates against the ruble			0
" @entity243 's @entity114 agrees			0
" what many do not see in this context is that there could n't be a better time to visit			2
people are friendlier than ever before , the cost for restaurants , theater visits , souvenirs , yes , even hotel overnights , are significantly lower , plus ... no queuing at the @entity255			0
" @entity256 is a @entity258 - based travel journalist			0
@entity259 : @ dailysuitcase.com @entity260			0

forecasts indicate @entity0 's tourism industry is on track for a tough year
tension in eastern @entity19 and annexation of @entity21 have hit ruble , making it a cheaper time to visit
@entity214 is now @entity0 's largest and fastest - growing international inbound market
