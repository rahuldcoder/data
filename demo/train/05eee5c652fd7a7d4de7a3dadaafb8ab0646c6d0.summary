@entity0 -- uncertainty ruled in @entity3 wednesday as the @entity5 holy month of @entity6 began and the military said it would address the issues of this week 's deadly violence			2
it was n't clear whether the religious observance would calm or inflame tensions a week after a military coup			2
the military , which ousted president @entity14 from office last week , said that 206 people who had been detained monday during deadly clashes with security forces face charges of manslaughter , voluntary manslaughter , acts of violence and illegal possession of firearms			1
the suspects will remain in police custody for another 15 days while investigations into their actions continue			2
more than 600 people in all were detained monday			1
the announcement comes as the military seeks to portray itself as a stabilizing force in the splintering nation			2
the question remains : who 's on board ? not the @entity38 , according to the group 's high official of religious law			1
grand mufti @entity42 told the @entity44 news agency that he does not recognize the authority of the nation 's interim president and will not negotiate until @entity14 regains power			2
what is the @entity38 ? " therefore , there is no need to speak about any decrees , because they were issued by people without authority , " @entity42 said			1
that 's a direct reference to interim president @entity57 , who has issued a constitutional declaration giving himself limited power to make laws and outlined a timetable for parliamentary and presidential elections , according to state media			1
the grand mufti 's position is important because the @entity38 's political wing , the @entity68 , won the most seats in parliamentary elections			1
@entity14 was elected president under the @entity68 banner			0
on wednesday , prosecutors issued arrest warrants for the @entity38 's chairman , @entity76 , and for the vice chairman of the @entity68 , @entity77 , state - run @entity73 reported			1
the @entity3 government said wednesday that @entity14 -- arrested last week during his ouster -- was in a safe place , and that no charges have been filed against him			2
" he is not free to go around , but he 's treated very well , " acting foreign minister @entity82 told @entity1 's @entity84			0
" and you understand that this is also for his own safety			0
" ' nail in coffin ' for @entity90 ? experts predict @entity3 's future interim government begins to take shape filling other key roles are @entity97 , a liberal economist who was finance minister and deputy prime minister , who will serve as the interim prime minister , and @entity101 , the @entity102 - winning diplomat , who will serve as interim vice president , the fledgling government said			0
@entity104 , @entity3 's official news agency , also reported that cabinet posts will be offered to the @entity68 , as well as to the @entity106			1
but their participation seems questionable with the @entity38 not recognizing the interim government and @entity109 -- which supported @entity14 's ouster -- withdrawing from the talks to form an interim government after this week 's deadly confrontation between the military and @entity14 supporters			1
fifty - one people died in the clashes outside @entity119 headquarters			1
the military has promised to investigate			0
@entity38 spokesman @entity120 said that even if invited , it could not participate in the interim government			1
" more than 700 of our members have been arrested , broadcasters have been shut down , and people killed in front of the @entity119 , " he said			2
" it is impossible to speak under the current circumstances			0
there is no way to have negotiations			0
" @entity101 : @entity14 's ouster was needed so @entity3 can not ' fail ' money pours in even as the interim government struggled to unify political support at home , it picked up the financial support of some regional heavyweights -- neither are fans of the @entity38			1
@entity143 's finance minister said the kingdom has pledged $ 5 billion in grants and loans to the interim government , according to the official @entity143 news agency @entity147			0
and the @entity148 will give $ 1 billion to @entity3 and lend it another $ 2 billion as an interest - free central bank deposit , state news agency @entity150 reported tuesday			0
@entity152 's support @entity57 : interim president , veteran judge , mystery man for now , the @entity156 continues to support @entity3 financially			1
the @entity157 has refused to describe as a coup the military 's ouster of @entity14 , who was reportedly being held under arrest at the @entity119 headquarters			0
doing so would require the @entity156 to suspend its $ 1.3 billion in annual military aid to @entity3			0
when is a coup not a coup ? it is in the interest of the @entity156 and the @entity3 people " in their transition to democracy to take the time necessary to evaluate the situation before making such a determination , " @entity157 spokesman @entity167 said tuesday			2
but he added that @entity156 officials were " cautiously encouraged " that the interim government 's plan " includes a return to democratically elected government that includes presidential and parliamentary elections			1
" in response to a question , @entity185 spokeswoman @entity184 told reporters that , " broadly speaking , " the administration still believes that continuing military aid is a @entity156 national security priority			0
but sen. @entity192 , @entity193 , has called for a suspension of military aid to @entity3			0
8 issues @entity3 is facing @entity1 's @entity197 reported from @entity0			0
@entity198 reported and wrote from @entity199 .			0

new : more than 200 people detained during clashes face charges
reports : cabinet posts will be offered to the @entity38 and @entity207
a presidential declaration by @entity57 would grant him limited *legislative* powers
the declaration outlines a timetable for parliamentary and presidential elections
