-- dr. @entity1 is actually happy when a call from work wakes him from a deep sleep			2
a call means the transplant surgeon at the @entity7 can save another life			1
he worries , though , about possible changes being discussed regarding the way donated organs are distributed ; if they go into effect , he may not be able to save so many lives			2
" i worry ( the possible changes ) will harm my patients , " @entity1 said			2
on september 16 , the @entity16 , the nonprofit that manages the nation 's transplant system , will hold a public hearing to discuss ways to " increase equity " in how organs are assigned to patients across the country			1
each organ has a different system for handling its waiting list , and the network has seen a particular problem with donated livers			1
currently , a donated liver is supposed to go first to the person who is most likely to die without a transplant , but the system also takes geographic factors into consideration			1
that means the sickest person in the country does n't always get dibs			0
instead , the system uses a " local , regional and national " algorithm			1
there are wide disparities in the number of organs available in the country 's 11 regions			0
in the @entity50 and @entity51 , donations are high			0
donations on the coasts are low			0
so if you live in @entity55 , an area that has one of the lowest liver donation rates , you would probably wait longer to qualify for a transplant than someone who lives in @entity60 , in a region where the donation rates are much higher			1
that 's why @entity65 co-founder @entity64 flew to @entity60 to get his liver transplant , even though he lived thousands of miles away in @entity55			1
these are disparities the organ network considers " unacceptably high			0
" ( @entity70 ) the biggest problem is a serious shortage of donated livers			1
although about 6,000 liver transplant operations happen each year , that 's only a fraction of those who need them			1
there are 15,600 people on the waiting list right now			1
an average of 1,500 people die each year while waiting for a liver transplant across all regions , whether there is a generous donor community or not			1
and the number of people needing liver transplants is expected to rise			1
with the nation 's obesity epidemic , fatty liver disease has become a growing problem with more patients needing transplants			1
" we lose someone every week who never got a shot at a lifesaving liver transplant because of where they live , " said dr. @entity97 , chief of transplantation and immunology at @entity100 and chairman of the @entity16 committee considering the change			1
" that same person would have had a shot if they lived in @entity114 or @entity115 or @entity116			0
" to address this disparity , @entity97 says , his committee is open to ideas			0
right now , it is considering a variety of mathematical models			0
one would reduce the 11 @entity125 transplant regions to four or eight			1
centers on the @entity128 and @entity129 coasts could see a 40 % to 50 % increase in volume with this shift , according to some estimates			0
these models worry doctors who live in the regions where the supply of donated organs is better			0
doctors in @entity114 benefit from a highly successful donor outreach program and do n't want their region to be an " organ farm " for the parts of the country where not as many donate , @entity1 says			0
" what they are attempting to do is say , ' hey , those guys have all the organs			0
let 's go over and poach those ' instead of having their own grass - roots campaign to identify new donors , " @entity1 said			1
dr. @entity156 , director of transplantation at the @entity7 , thinks the organ network 's committee is looking at the problem the wrong way			0
instead of shifting regions , he believes , it should focus on signing up more organ donors			1
" that 's where we should devote all our energy , rather than just shuffle the organs around the country , " @entity156 said			0
" i think everyone in @entity16 and in the transplant community wants to save more lives ; that is a no - brainer			2
but we feel that geographic disparity is more a reflection of other broader problems			0
" this week , @entity156 and doctors at dozens of transplant centers in the @entity51 and the @entity50 sent a letter of protest to the organ network , urging the committee not to make any changes until all available data are considered			2
if the network implements the " concept " proposal and broadens the geographic boundaries for sharing donor livers , it would " represent the most drastic change in liver allocation ever , " the authors wrote , and " would significantly disadvantage many areas of the country currently able to serve their patient populations			2
" a congressional delegation from @entity115 also sent a letter in april , asking the network to put a hold on the remapping process			0
their letter argues that the changes could reduce the " number of liver transplants performed in @entity115 by 25 % " and " inevitably drive up costs , decrease survival rates , and waste precious resources in an already constrained sector of healthcare			2
" transporting organs longer distances could cost health care centers $ 30 million more annually , according to some estimates			0
@entity97 argues that cost would be offset when doctors have to take care of fewer people with end - stage liver failure			1
@entity97 says his committee will make sure it does not " hurt the regions that have been successful " with organ donation			0
he believes that ultimately , a new system will save hundreds of lives every year			2
" we are totally aware that there are certain parts of the country that will see big shifts , and that will be scary to them , but we have to take off our hats that represent our individual centers and think about what is best for patients all across the country , " @entity97 said			2
both sides of the debate agree though , that no matter how the system will change , it is only a temporary fix akin to " rearranging the deck chairs on a sinking ship , " @entity97 said			0
" we are going to continue to have this problem if people do n't donate			2
" to become an organ donor , register at @entity249			0
waiting for a new face : transplants give people back their lives			1

there is a shortage of liver transplant donors in the @entity125
only 6,000 of nearly *16,000* people on waiting list get a liver transplant each year
there are big regional differences in how many will get a transplant
