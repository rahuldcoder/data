-- tens of thousands of people spent part of april 15 at organized " tea party " demonstrations across the country , protesting what some view as excessive government spending and bailouts			1
" @entity12 " protesters rally on wednesday in @entity13 , @entity14			1
widely promoted by conservatives on videos and blogs , the movement appears , in part , a reflection of a general anger among people who contend the government takes too much from their pocketbooks			1
though financial - industry and automotive bailouts were launched at the end of @entity30 's presidency , many demonstrators aimed their words and signs at the @entity34 administration , criticizing it in part for the recently passed stimulus package			1
@entity0 's @entity38 spoke wednesday afternoon to one of the organizers of the " tea party " protests , @entity42 , president of @entity43			1
the organization 's web site identifies him as " a veteran political strategist and one of the nation 's premier grassroots organizers with nearly two decades of experience , including presidential , gubernatorial and congressional races , as well as state legislative , local and issue - advocacy campaigns			1
" he is a former chief of staff to rep. @entity56 , a @entity57 from @entity58			1
here are excerpts from the interview			1
@entity61 : how do you feel about the turnout ? as i looked at it , i saw that there were a couple of places where the group was small			1
but , still , you have to take into account that the spread is amazing			1
@entity61 : this is all over the country			2
@entity72 : there are literally -- the best estimate is between 800 and 1,000 of these things across the country			2
and it 's a genuine grassroots uprising			1
yes , groups like @entity43 , we 're working and helping and organizing			2
but no one group , @entity84 , no one organization , no one political party could pull off something like this			2
it 's a genuine grassroots fire out there			1
@entity61 : why did n't we see these during the @entity30 administration , who , by the way , has been accused , by the right and the left , of being a bit of a spendthrift himself ? @entity72 : well , let me tell you , in 2006 , i was in these very studios as part of @entity43 's @entity101			1
we went to the site of the 50 most outrageous earmarks in the country			2
we went to more @entity57 districts than @entity107 districts			1
and it 's similar , because it 's overspending and wasteful spending			1
@entity61 : but you know what takes -- you know , my old football coach used to call it intestinal fortitude			2
it 's when you do what no one expects you to do			2
like [ rep. ] @entity121 [ @entity122 ] , when he stood up in front of a @entity57 debate and was booed for saying this administration , referring to @entity30 , has been irresponsible and has spent too much , that 's surprising			1
those are the guys you have got to give credence to			2
republicans now blaming @entity34 for spending too much , it almost looks like , gee , there is a surprise			1
you guys were going to do this no matter what he did			2
@entity72 : i think you 're missing an important point			2
today is not a @entity57 thing			1
the @entity57 frankly is too disorganized and too unsure of itself to pull off stuff like this			1
this is a grassroots uprising that is telling elected officials in both parties , hey , guys , there is too much debt			1
we 're going to pile up more debt this year [ than we did ] from 1776 to 1980 in adjusted dollars			2
today is a movement , a freedom movement , a conservative freedom movement			1
it 's not a party movement			1
@entity61 : and i think that 's fair			0
and i think a lot of people would agree with you , looking at it from a fiscal standpoint			0
@entity61 : but then there 's also this			0
we were doing a report earlier today			0
one of our correspondents was on the air reporting			0
and i noticed something behind her			0
and i said , oh my goodness , look at that			0
and i bet you it 's not something @entity181 's going to be pleased by			0
look at that , what it says			0
go ahead and turn around			0
look at the screen right there			0
do we see that guy that says , " i 'm not your @entity190 " ? @entity72 : right			0
@entity61 : it 's a white hand giving money to a black hand			0
you know , what do you make of that ? does that bother you a little bit ? @entity72 : i think that any time you have literally tens of thousands of people from all walks of life coming out to rallies and events , there 's going to be one sign that 's objectionable or one statement that you would rather not be said			0
@entity61 : it 's not representative ? @entity72 : right			0
[ not ] in any way does it discount , you know , the good @entity217 protest that 's going out there today			0
here 's what i would challenge every media organization to do : go to the rally in @entity223 [ @entity224 ] today or any of the rallies that have happened across the country and grab the first 12 people you see			0
and say , why are you here and tell me what about your background			0
you 're going to find the most broadly represented mainstream @entity217 who are concerned about the future with all this spending , all this debt , all these new taxes			1
i would challenge organizations to do that			0
whenever you 've got tens of thousands , really , over 100,000 , coming to somewhere between 800 and 1,000 events across the country ...			0
@entity61 : but you 're saying it 's by far the exception and by no means the norm			0
and the best way , though , to prove that is go to the events and by the way , you 've been showing people at the rallies who are normal average folks and i 'm not dinging you			0
but that 's the best way to do it			0
the events i 've been to across the country leading up to today and then today , these are the most mainstream , broadly defined @entity217 who are genuinely concerned .			0

@entity42 : tea parties are a broad grassroots movement for freedom
he says the protests are n't driven by the @entity57
@entity42 : level of *federal* spending is unsustainable
