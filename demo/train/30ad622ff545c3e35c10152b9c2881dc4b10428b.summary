-- you 'll have to be doggedly clever to unlock @entity3 's new @entity2			1
@entity3 , 23 , was fooling around with the fingerprint sensor on the @entity2 he purchased friday morning			1
he found it dull locking and unlocking it with his own finger , so he decided to find out what would happen if he programmed the front right paw of his pet @entity11 , @entity12 , into the gadget			1
how secure is your @entity2 fingerprint ? much to his surprise , the pawprint did the job			1
" i thought this is never going to work , and it did ! " @entity3 told @entity21			2
" the funniest thing is , it only works for the paw i programmed			2
it does n't work for the other three			0
" dogs are n't the only four - legged friends who can handle the sensor			2
@entity29 found it has worked for cats , too			0
@entity3 , a musician in @entity31 , @entity32 , is an @entity33 fan : he was in line at @entity32 's @entity35 at 4:45 a.m. to be among the first to get the new @entity2			1
the phone has a fingerprint sensor in its home button for added security			1
users must " register " their print with the device , after which they can unlock the phone by placing a finger or thumb on the button			0
but though he 's been tickled by the finger ( paw ? ) print sensor , @entity3 's not too pleased with the particular phone he bought			1
the sound from the phone receiver is muffled and he suspects he 'll have to return it			0
when he does , @entity12 might not be as cooperative			0
" the more i do it the angrier he gets , " @entity3 said			2
" i 've tried all the paws now and he put up quite a fight to get the back ones on there			0
i have to give him a lot of treats			0
perhaps a new @entity33 marketing strategy ?			0

*ireporter* @entity3 finds new @entity2 fingerprint sensor works for his dog
@entity3 's dog , @entity12 , had paw programmed to unlock the @entity2
@entity12 is n't too fond of his role , however -- " the more i do it , the angrier he gets "
