-- a @entity2 insurgent with a rocket - propelled grenade has painfully brought back the question : is the @entity6 strategy succeeding in @entity7 ? @entity9 officials said it was reportedly an rpg that brought down a military helicopter carrying 30 @entity6 service members , 25 of whom were special operations forces , on saturday			2
all were killed in the crash , along with seven @entity7 troops and an @entity7 interpreter			2
it was the worst single - day loss of @entity6 life since the start of the war in late 2001			2
army lt. @entity21 , who spent most of last year in eastern @entity7 , said he believes in the counterinsurgency principles pushed by gen. @entity23 , who is now director of the @entity24			1
he even wrote an essay about it in the online publication @entity28			0
the strategy boils down to this : insurgents rely on the fear and intimidation of local citizens to keep control , so the counterinsurgency focuses on protecting local citizens from the @entity2 and rallying them to the @entity7 government			1
" i do n't want to downplay the role of taking care of bad guys , " said @entity21 , who was based in @entity39 , a stronghold of the @entity2 that has plenty of insurgents			1
" we took on a lot of rockets and mortars			0
but the majority of my time in @entity7 , i was not under fire			0
i was interacting with people over there			0
the more you do that , i would argue , the better results			0
" @entity21 believes interaction is imperative , even with the constant uncertainty of whether the person you 're talking to is a good guy or a bad guy			1
" one guy might be favorable one week , " @entity21 said , " but because i stopped his car for my truck to get over a ditch , that prevented him from getting to the doctor 's office ... ( and ) now he hates the government			1
" khost province shares a border with @entity71 , the region of @entity72 that has been a safe haven for jihadists			0
the @entity6 believes that @entity75 hid there for years after the september 11 attacks , and it has recently been a testing ground for @entity23 ' counterinsurgency tactics			2
@entity21 tried to put himself in the @entity7 ' shoes			1
he said he can imagine how he would feel if his country were occupied for a decade by a foreign army dressed , as he put it , like " automatons			1
" so he tried to play against it			0
" you 'd walk up to somebody and say , ' as - salaamu alaykum			0
' ' @entity88 ? ' it 's kind of like ' what 's up ? ' " @entity21 said			1
" it 's like 20 different ways of saying hello			0
i would walk up to an old man , shake his hand , look him straight in the face -- with my sunglasses off , so he could see my eyes -- and we would be shaking hands for probably one or two minutes			0
" @entity21 did n't mind looking goofy , fumbling with the @entity101 language or trying to tell a joke			1
he said he was trying -- and trying gets across in any culture , even when you 're part of a foreign army			1
he says the human part of his job -- finding out what villages needed to prosper and keep independent of insurgents -- was a little like living in a small town			2
" you know the people you go to church with			0
you know that ms. @entity117 's dog went to the vet last week and mr. @entity119 had to have surgery			0
you know those intimate details			0
" in @entity7 , @entity21 said , " i could tell you when one guy 's crops were going to be harvested			1
i could tell you in this village , they 'd go to this house to worship instead of the mosque , because it had better heat			2
i could tell you what time prayer was going to be and who went to that mosque			0
" @entity21 had been in the country for 10 months when he went into one village he did n't know well			1
he did what he always does when he visits a new place : he and his @entity7 counterpart told the locals that they wanted to talk to the most influential person in the village			1
out walked a decrepit old man with a long beard			0
it took him 15 minutes to come out of his house and into the square			0
he had several wool blankets around his shoulders , and he was carrying a gnarled tree branch for a cane			0
he sat down and rested his hands on the cane between his knees			0
@entity21 says he felt guilty for pulling the old man out of his warm house , but the man started talking right away			1
" he said : ' i have a problem			0
i know i 'm about to die			0
this village does not have any leadership set up to succeed me , and i 'm concerned			2
" then he just sat there looking at me			0
" @entity21 said he was n't sure what to think of a village elder asking for help from a foreign soldier			1
the elder told him about how @entity2 insurgents had recently killed three of his villagers and left their bodies to rot as a reminder not to cross them			2
he also told him about other problems			0
all the time they were talking , @entity21 said , he was trying to figure out a way to help			1
he knew he could n't really help in the long term , but the elder clearly " wanted some kind of answer , some kind of solution			2
" then something came to @entity21			1
he remembered a village elder just to the north named @entity190			1
@entity6 and @entity7 troops had cleared out @entity2 insurgents there the year before , and the village was prospering			2
@entity21 asked the old man whether he knew @entity190			1
the man said that he did but that he had n't spoken to @entity190 in years			0
so @entity21 took a chance			1
" i said , ' if you know this guy , and this guy is succeeding , and you 're both village elders in eastern @entity7 , why do n't you talk to each other ? ' " @entity21 said			1
the old man looked at him as though the idea had n't occurred to him , but he liked it , @entity21 said			1
@entity21 then went to @entity190 's village and asked @entity190 to help his neighbor to the south			1
" i go : ' you see how safe and secure your village is now ? how much safer , how much more prosperous would it be if the village just south of it were just as strong and secure and prosperous as yours ? ' " he said			2
@entity190 said he would do what he could to help			0
as @entity21 was leaving , he saw two figures heading toward @entity190 's village			1
one was a young boy			0
the other was the old man carrying his gnarled tree branch			0
three weeks later , @entity21 shipped out of @entity7			1
he said a small part of him wanted to stay to see how it worked out .			2

winning *civilians* ' trust is the key to the counterinsurgency , says one @entity225 *lieutenant*
lt. @entity21 says that when he visits a new village , he first tries to meet its elder
@entity21 says " trying " gets across in any culture , even if you 're part of a foreign army
