-- @entity2 's ongoing military operation in @entity3 -- @entity4 -- has animated the @entity6 leadership in @entity7			1
the bloody conflict , and the global @entity10 outrage it has provoked , is held by the @entity12 regime as a chance to redeem itself in the eyes of the @entity10 majority in the world			1
when @entity12 's @entity19 ayatollah @entity18 this week called on the " @entity20 " to set aside differences and unite against @entity2 , he was in fact pitching @entity12 leadership			2
other @entity10 leaders speak in such terms			0
the difference is @entity12 has the capacity to militarily make a difference by resuming arms supplies to @entity30			0
as @entity18 and other @entity12 leaders intensify the call to arm @entity30 , the political reward they seek is hard to miss. on the geopolitical map of the @entity37 , the @entity3 conflict offers an opportunity for @entity7 to perhaps start reversing a trend for @entity12 to be seen as a @entity6 power -- thanks to its support for the @entity44 regime in the @entity46 civil war -- and go back to what it prefers most : to carry the @entity50 banner and offer itself as the principal guardian of @entity10 causes			1
the beleaguered @entity30 -- @entity12 's one - time favorite @entity10 surrogate -- might not have an alternative but to return to @entity7 's orbit after a four - year freeze in relations			1
senior security officers from the @entity59 ( @entity59 ) in @entity60 in the @entity61 are keeping a very close eye on the @entity12 - @entity30 dynamics			0
officials in the @entity59 , dominated by @entity30 ' secular rivals from the @entity67 movement , fear that @entity12 extending its hand to @entity30 will only embolden it and prolong this latest military round with @entity2			0
at the same time , officials from the @entity59 detect a strong tendency among @entity30 leaders to be open to @entity7 's conditions for a resumption of @entity12 assistance should @entity7 decide to forgive @entity30 for its 2011 betrayal			1
that is when @entity30 chose to back the @entity46 opposition against the @entity7 - backed regime of @entity44 and thus left @entity12 's orbit after nearly two - decades of @entity12 patronage			1
according to one @entity59 official , " @entity30 has no other option except to return to its @entity12 sponsor			0
" as he put it , " @entity12 's relations with @entity30 were from the outset tactical " and the present circumstances make reconciliation beneficial to both			1
@entity30 can look forward to the resumption of @entity12 arms			0
@entity7 can hope to turn the global @entity10 attention to its role as a protector of @entity95 , a development that serves its regional agenda given the unpopularity of @entity12 support for @entity44 in @entity46 among @entity10 public opinion			1
in reality , @entity7 never entirely cut @entity30 loose after the debacle over @entity46			2
according to a senior @entity59 official , @entity30 ' political contacts with @entity12 were largely frozen but the military relationship has continued throughout			0
@entity7 never shut the door to the radical line of @entity30 leaders , including @entity109 in @entity3 , and @entity110 , the former representative of @entity30 to @entity12			1
other @entity30 chiefs did not receive this @entity12 benevolence			0
@entity114 , the one - time @entity116 - based political face of @entity30 who relocated to @entity118 in 2011 , has -- according to @entity12 media -- tried unsuccessfully for the last three years to make a visit @entity7			2
he was kept at bay but there is now speculation that @entity7 might be willing to receive @entity114			0
if so , it might just be the beginning of the end of the @entity30 - @entity12 fallout over @entity46			2
the groundwork for such a visit might already be in place			0
soon after @entity2 launched its latest campaign against @entity30 in @entity3 , the influential speaker of @entity12 's parliament , @entity131 , was on the phone with @entity114			1
a few days later , the @entity12 foreign minister , @entity135 called , each promising @entity7 's support			1
@entity141 of @entity142 , the jewel in @entity12 's @entity140 crown , has also opened the door to @entity30			1
@entity59 reports suggest that the @entity145 ( @entity145 ) , a militant movement close to @entity12 that unlike @entity30 stayed loyal to @entity7 over its support for @entity44 in @entity46 , is now mediating between @entity30 and @entity141			1
the head of @entity145 , @entity147 , is said to personally lead the effort , which has included a phone conversation between @entity150 and @entity114			0
last week , @entity150 gave an impassioned speech where he pledged " @entity141 and the @entity142 resistance will stand by the @entity59 peoples ' uprising , " but he has thus far resisted @entity30 ' call for it to open a northern front against @entity2			0
" with @entity141 fighters still in action in @entity46 in support of the @entity44 regime , and with memories fresh of @entity30 ' support for the @entity46 opposition , and given @entity150 's delicate domestic policy agenda in @entity166 , a northern front is very doubtful in this round of fighting			1
still , @entity12 and @entity141 can deliver weapons and military know - how , something that other @entity30 backers -- such as @entity118 and @entity173 -- are unable or unwilling to do			0
as major general @entity174 , the former commander of @entity175 ( @entity176 ) put it , @entity30 needs to return to the @entity12 orbit as it desperately needs military replenishment			2
@entity59 sources believe that @entity114 's visit to @entity7 likely will happen once a ceasefire with @entity2 has been agreed			0
he is expected to thank @entity7 for its support and use the visit as a public pronouncement that the @entity30 - @entity12 spat is finally over			2
a visit to @entity7 by @entity114 , however , is still entangled in the geopolitical mess that is today 's @entity37			0
@entity114 's closest regional allies , @entity118 , where he lives , and @entity173 , are still at loggerheads with @entity7 over competition for influence in @entity46 and increasingly in @entity192			2
as a way to bypass this hindrance , @entity7 will no longer insist that @entity30 publicly support the @entity44 regime in @entity46 but only to refrain from publicly criticizing his rule			1
according to @entity59 sources in the @entity61 , @entity30 is willing to make this compromise with @entity7 .			0

@entity3 has provoked outrage in the @entity10 world , write @entity202 and @entity203
@entity7 is trying to build on the outrage , to gain influence by backing @entity30 , they say
this follows @entity12 's backing of the @entity44 regime in @entity46 , while @entity30 backs *rebels*
@entity30 needs to return to @entity7 's orbit in order to get military supplies , authors say
