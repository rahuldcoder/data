-- after three days of testimony , the details and accounts from the @entity4 sexual abuse trial are , improbably , even more chilling and horrific than could have been imagined			1
multiple accusers , now grown men , have broken down on the witness stand describing acts of forced oral sex and intercourse , threats and manipulation			0
another witness left the courthouse with a black bag over his head , such , presumably , was his level of shame and embarrassment			0
we respect the judicial process and the presumption of innocence			0
yet calling these witnesses " alleged " victims , as we must absent a verdict , nonetheless feels callous			0
while no one would dare imply that his suffering is akin to that of a sexual assault victim , another figure damaged in this sordid scandal took the stand on tuesday , bolstering the prosecution 's case : @entity36			1
@entity4 trial : all you need to know it is @entity36 , of course , who has played a -- perhaps , the -- crucial role in the @entity44 narrative since the story broke in november			1
then a graduate assistant for the @entity48 football team , @entity36 was at the @entity49 in 2001 , when he heard what he described as " skin - on - skin smacking sound " coming from the shower facility			2
using a mirror , @entity36 could see @entity4 standing behind a boy " propped up against a wall " performing a sexual act			1
though almost 6 feet 5 inches , and 30 years @entity4 's junior , @entity36 did not physically intervene or call the police			1
he chose only to slam a locker door , as he testified , in hopes of breaking up the incident			0
the following day , after conferring with his father , @entity36 reported what he saw to @entity66 , the team 's revered coach			2
@entity66 then waited another day to speak to the athletic director			0
the athletic director then talked to a superior , who relayed the incident to university president @entity72			0
the allegation lost severity with each retelling			0
an act initially described as man - on - boy intercourse had become horseplay that made a witness " uncomfortable			0
" initially , @entity36 was cast as a villain , the embodiment of the banality of evil			1
how could he not have confronted @entity4 that evening ? or at least called the cops ? and how could he have remained silent as he saw @entity4 in the same football facility and at various functions , sometimes in the company of young boys ? as of last fall , @entity36 was a prominent @entity44 assistant coach			1
since then , he has been placed on administrative leave by the school			0
his coaching career , to say nothing of his reputation , is in tatters			0
but recently , @entity36 has become , at a minimum , a more complex figure			2
as we have learned more about the insularity of the @entity44 football program , @entity36 's inaction that evening becomes , if not altogether understandable , at least somewhat easier to comprehend			1
what 's more , @entity0 is among the news outlets reporting that @entity103 , @entity44 's former vice president for finance and business , kept a secret file on @entity4 that included e-mails among administrators about inappropriate behavior			2
this not only contradicts previous statements by administrators ; it suggests that @entity36 's initial statements in 2001 were more forceful and clear than they 've been portrayed			1
asked about the incident in the trial , @entity36 admitted , " i 've said repeatedly i did n't do anything physically to stop it			2
it 's been well publicized ... did i pull the boy out of there , did i physically go and assault anybody , did i remove him ? ... physically [ @entity120 ] did n't remove the young boy from the shower or go and punch @entity4 out			2
" @entity36 went on to assert that , after 2001 , he was so repulsed by @entity4 he could n't occupy the same room , so much so that other members of the football staff took notice			1
why , he was asked , did n't he quit ? " i would never resign from @entity128 , " he said			0
as heart - rending as the victims ' testimony has been , @entity36 's firm and unambiguous account could be just as damaging to @entity4			1
the defense will argue that the accusers have embellished their stories , motivated by the financial gain of a civil suit			0
in the case of @entity36 , now 37 , it 's hard to argue there 's a profit motive			2
plus , having another adult corroborate the accounts of the many witnesses undermines the defense 's claims of conspiracy among the victims			0
more than a decade ago , @entity36 's failure to act with sufficient conviction may have permitted a serial sexual abuser to continue on			1
if @entity36 's honest testimony enables a jury to convict @entity4 , at least he will have made the most of his second opportunity to do the right thing			1
alleged victims testify as @entity4 prosecution prepares to rest alleged @entity4 victim details abuse prosecutors : @entity4 file contradicts officials ' testimony the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity168 .			1

@entity168 : testimonies from the @entity4 trial are chilling and horrific
@entity168 : @entity36 has a second chance to do the right thing
he says @entity36 was cast as a villain , but he 's more complex as details emerge
@entity168 : @entity36 's account could be very damaging to @entity4
