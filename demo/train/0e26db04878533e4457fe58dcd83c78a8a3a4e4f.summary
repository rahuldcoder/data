-- at the closing ceremony of the @entity2 , the @entity4 president , declared that the @entity5 had been the best ever			2
@entity6 celebrates after winning gold in the 400 meters			2
superbly organized and featuring a record 10,651 athletes , @entity8 produced a number of memorable moments , such as @entity13 's fifth consecutive rowing gold and the three golds and two silvers taken by @entity16 in the swimming events			1
but one performer stood out above all others : @entity20 's @entity6			2
every @entity21 produces one unique individual who somehow comes to define those games : @entity24 in 1936 , @entity25 in 1952 , @entity26 in 1976			1
in 2000 it was the aboriginal @entity6 , whose lighting of the @entity21 flame and subsequent victory in the 400 meters were of huge symbolic significance to a nation still wrestling with the legacy of its maltreatment of its indigenous peoples			1
@entity6 was already an @entity39 sporting icon prior to @entity40 , having won two gold medals at the 1994 @entity5 ( for 200 meters and 400 meters ) , and back - to - back 400 meters gold medals at the 1997 and 1999 world championships ( as well as a 400 meters silver medal at the @entity45 )			1
it was n't simply her athletic prowess that had made her a national heroine , however ( in 1998 she was named @entity39 of the year ) , but the fact that she was one of the very few native aborigines to achieve success , sporting or otherwise , in a country that until 1962 had refused to even allow aborigines the right to vote			1
although she was never an overt political activist , preferring to make her statement on the running track , @entity6 was nonetheless deeply proud of her heritage , and made a point , whenever she won an international race , of carrying not just the @entity39 flag but the aboriginal one as well on her lap of honor			1
powerful statement her choice as the person to light the @entity21 flame at the @entity40 opening ceremony -- the last in a relay of @entity20 's great olympians , and the first time in @entity21 history a participating athlete had been given the honor -- was seen as a powerful statement of national contrition and reconciliation			1
if her role in the opening ceremony was replete with symbolism , however , it was just a prelude to the events of 10 nights later when , in the most eagerly anticipated contest of the @entity5 , @entity6 lined up in lane six of @entity20 for the 400 meters final			0
wearing a hooded green and yellow bodysuit , and cheered on hysterically by a sell - out crowd of 110,000 people -- not to mention the tens of millions glued to their television sets worldwide -- she paced herself perfectly through the race , crossing the finishing line in a time of 49.11 seconds to take the gold medal , ahead of @entity94 of @entity95 and @entity97 's @entity96			0
so intense had been the pressure she was under , and so enormous the weight of expectation resting on her shoulders , that , once the race was over , she could do nothing but sit down on the track and hang her head , physically and emotionally exhausted			0
" i was totally overwhelmed , " she later said			0
" i could feel the crowd totally around me , all over me			0
i just felt everybody 's emotion and happiness and joy			0
i was totally absorbing it into every pore in my body			0
i just had to sit down			0
" her victory was not simply a great sporting achievement , but a defining moment of modern @entity39 history , the entire country united in jubilation at a performance that seemed to hold out hope for a less divided , more racially inclusive society			1
when she had finally recovered herself @entity6 came to her feet again and , holding the @entity39 and @entity123 flags above her head , set off on a lap of honor , the stadium echoing to the sound of the chanting of her name			1
" her victory was one of the great sporting events of our generation , " said @entity39 prime minister @entity131			2
" she is a great @entity39			2
" " all i know is that i made a lot of people happy from a lot of backgrounds who call @entity20 home , " was @entity6 's assessment of her achievement			0
she retired from athletics in july 2003 .			0

she was one of the very few native aborigines to achieve success
she was chosen to light the @entity21 flame at the 2000 @entity8 games
she always carried both the @entity39 and aboriginal flag on her lap of honor
