to help her cope with the sadness , @entity3 recently moved into a spacious new mansion on a hilltop above @entity34 , @entity35 , away from the @entity37 home where the @entity38 lived since 1969			1

but since she 's a @entity73 's witness , @entity3 does not observe holidays			1
wednesday is her 81st birthday , but there will be no celebration in her home			0

" they 're going to school everyday			0

" i plan to be there everyday , " she said			0
" if i 'm able , i will be there			0
" she 'll be there listening as the doctor who conducted the autopsy describes again , as she heard in last january 's preliminary hearing , how @entity7 's liver was placed in a blender so he could measure the chemicals in his organs			1
" worse comes to worse , i 'll just step out , " she said			0
" i heard they 're going to show some autopsy shots , and i do n't want to see that			2
so , i 'll leave and , you know , sit out in the hall or somewhere until it 's over and then i 'll come back in			0
but i just feel that i have to be there			0
" @entity3 , although she 'd rather avoid sadness , proved her strength six years ago when she sat in court for five months as her son was tried and acquitted on child molestation charges			1

" i wanted to be there for him , because i knew it was lies			0
i prayed for the truth to come , because i knew if the truth came out that my son would walk away and he did			0
" some online media reports have suggested @entity3 's health is failing , but she laughs about the speculation			1
