ran with the bulls in @entity13 , @entity14			1
i went looking for the journal after photographer @entity16 and i were assigned to cover a rendition of @entity13 's famed @entity18 in @entity19 , @entity20			1
that was apparent as soon as we arrived at @entity19 ' @entity24 , a far cry from @entity13 , where the " encierro " is run on a half - mile of cobblestone streets through town			1
there 's a good deal more pageantry in @entity13 , as you might expect , with the rockets , or txupinazo , counting down to the running , the @entity36 and @entity37 and afternoon bullfights			1
conyers had free beef jerky			1
but was it ever going to measure up ? relying on a journal from a seemingly constantly inebriated 22 - year - old , i realized that outside of bulls and beer , the events are nothing alike			2
( author 's note : many of the revelations in the aforementioned journal were long forgotten by the writer until it was discovered in his home office last week			2
unless otherwise noted , all quotes are from the journal			0
) the purpose the @entity56 is nakedly a for - profit event			2
it will visit nine more cities between now and august before returning to the @entity61 area in october 2014			0
upcoming locations to merely spectate cost $ 10 , while running alongside the bovine herd cost anywhere between $ 45 and $ 75			2
those enchanted by the experience could run again for $ 25			0
this is n't to say @entity13 is n't a moneymaker			1
there just is n't a fee for anyone bold / dumb enough to get in the street with bulls , but the encierro is still a major cash cow for @entity13 ( terrible pun intended )			1
@entity13 's infrastructure is so unequipped to handle its @entity18 visitors , which can quadruple the city 's population , that makeshift shops and beer stands pop up all over town			1
the hotels are booked far in advance , so my cohorts and i " walked down to the park ( @entity89 ) and found a nice corner under a tree where we 'd reside for the weekend			0
" the park was packed with revelers , most of them charming , but one who " was sniffing cocaine off of a paper plate " and another " bastard who tried to pick ( my pal 's ) pocket while we were sleeping			2
" taking in all the revelry was great fun , but sleeping in the park took its toll , as washing up in a plaza fountain over a long weekend left me feeling " like i 'd been dipped in mayonnaise			0
the purpose , as it were , for the festival is to honor the patron @entity110			0
it dates back to the @entity112 , as opposed to 2013 for @entity19 , and many locals told us at the time that @entity110 was killed and dragged through the streets of @entity13 by bulls			1
it appears he was actually beheaded			0
getting there traveling to @entity19 involved driving 25 miles east of the city in a @entity123			1
@entity13 , however , required a hellish trek after a language barrier resulted in us showing up two hours late for the express train			1
the slow train took 10 hours to make the 250 - mile trip from @entity130 , where i was attending school			2
fortunately , it had a bar car where we imbibed @entity136 and @entity137 before returning to our train car for a siesta			0
we continued our naps in the @entity142 train station , where during a two - hour layover , i awoke to find " a guy with a @entity145 and a safety pin through his cheek who had decided to micturate on the floor of the train station			0
" on the last leg , we hopped a " train full of ... @entity14 who sang all the way to @entity13 , " then caught a bus downtown to find " ( expletives ) partying like it was dec. 31 , 1999			1
" the bulls the @entity19 bulls were pansies			1
this is n't merely my observation			0
not only did they have the ends of their horns shorn off ( the tips of a @entity169 bull 's horns resemble pitchforks ) , but they 're also a good deal smaller than the @entity14 species			1
" more like running with goats , " said a man named @entity174 , laughing and beer in hand			2
" i think if a bull hits me , i might do more damage to him			2
" @entity181 , 72 , a retired @entity182 diver who has been to @entity13 eight times since 2000 , told me a bull broke three of his ribs in 2004			1
" i just was in the way , i guess , " he said			0
" it 's hard to escape over there			2
" after the @entity19 run , @entity181 seemed unfazed that the bridge of his nose was bloody and most of the skin was missing from one of his elbows			1
he said he did n't know whether a bull or the crowd ran him over -- " it was awful hard " -- but he expressed relief he 'd taken a tumble on a horse track rather than @entity13 's cobblestone streets			1
still , the " adrenaline junkie " was unimpressed with the @entity19 bulls ' ferocity			1
" in @entity13 , those bulls are bred at a special place in the south of @entity14 to be mean and aggressive			1
the bulls there will look for you and run you down , " he said			2
the actual running as the bulls and their white - and - red - clad entourage galloped toward @entity13 's @entity216 , the streets trembled			1
@entity218 fences separated the bulls from spectators , and @entity222 paramedics were stationed along them to tend to injured runners			2
as the bulls neared -- and i saw how big these beasts actually were -- i chickened out and sought refuge behind the fence , the crowd erupting in glee as they thundered past			2
once the bulls and runners blew by the clock tower where i was catching my breath , " i jumped the fence to find my amigos			0
all of a sudden , everyone screamed and darted for the fence			0
a wee bit dazed , i turned around to see a million - pound bull standing 20 feet from me			0
" the sight apparently conjured my @entity242 upbringing as " i hit the wall of people like a battering ram , asking @entity247 's forgiveness for all my sins , as i desperately tried to swim over the people and the @entity222 fence			0
" where @entity13 's streets were narrower , offering few options for escape , the @entity19 event was run on a wide , dirt track with several nooks in the steel gating			1
i jogged on the fringe of the @entity19 running , experiencing virtually none of the raw fear that had possessed me 16 years before			1
as the bulls neared , i dipped into one of the nooks and watched , amused , as the cattle passed			0
the grand finale the @entity19 running was capped by an enormous tomato fight , which is reminiscent of another @entity14 festival , @entity268 in @entity270 ol			1
they basically dumped 50,000 pounds of tomatoes in a parking lot and let attendees have at it			0
it was hilarious watching participants emerge , covered in seeds and red tomato excrement			0
the @entity13 running happens every morning for eight days and culminates in a series of bullfights			1
the runners and bulls spill from @entity285 into the stadium , where the bulls are corralled			0
runners scramble around the bullfighting ground tussling with smaller bulls , which were described to me as babies			0
" these were not babies			0
the baby had a three - foot rack and was flipping full - grown humans through the air with ease			0
" after watching the spectacle for about 20 minutes or so , we left the stadium and " found a nice plot of grass in front of the stadium to take a nap			0
when we woke up , we made our way to one of the makeshift bars and drank @entity310			0
" conversely , in @entity19 , @entity16 and i hopped in the @entity123 and drove back to @entity61			1
i made it home just in time for the @entity314 game			0
follow @entity315 on @entity316 : @ @entity317			0

@entity19 , @entity20 , holds first in series of bull runs , *kicking* off *nationwide* tour
event is quite unlike the @entity13 , @entity14 's @entity18
@entity13 has pageantry , parades , bullfights ; @entity19 has free beef jerky
@entity13 vets attending the @entity19 running *complain* bulls are pansies
