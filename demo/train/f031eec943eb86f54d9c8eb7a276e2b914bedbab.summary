@entity0 , @entity1 -- want to help save the humpback whale ? pick up a camera and start taking pictures , says @entity6 , a " fluke matcher " at @entity8 , a research group			1
@entity6 is a citizen scientist -- a do - goodery term for volunteers who help collect data about the natural world -- who uses the photo - sharing site @entity13 to catalog photos of whales			1
not just any photos , though			2
she 's specifically interested in the humpback 's fluke , or the tail			0
on humpbacks , the underside of the fluke carries unique identifying information in the form of a splotchy black and white pattern			2
this can be used to tell one whale from another , much the way fingerprints work for humans			2
@entity6 spends time looking through these whale - tail photos and matching them to each other			1
combining that data with dates , she and other scientists can track a particular whale 's movement over time , giving each of these enormous marine mammals a story that otherwise would be unknown			0
to learn more about the whales , however , more photos are needed			1
" if you go whale watching , take a camera , " she said in an interview on a boat off the coast of @entity1 , where she was speaking to a group of people attending the annual @entity51 conference			0
" and then put it on @entity13			1
" the conclusions scientists draw from these amateur photos are not insignificant			0
last year , for example , @entity6 -- a spry , gray - haired woman who wears tinted glasses that nearly cover her face and an orange jacket bright enough to make onlookers wish they had tinted lenses of their own -- did a casual @entity13 search and noticed that a particular humpback whale , no. 1363 in the official whale catalog , had been spotted by a man who was on vacation in @entity71			1
two years before that photo was taken , the same whale was seen off the coast of @entity75 , some 6,000 miles away			1
that migration route was longer than any that had been recorded for a single humpback , according to a journal article that cited the finding			0
" this observation is altogether unprecedented , " @entity81 , a marine biologist at @entity82 , and author of that article , told @entity85			0
" there are only a few humpback whales that have been seen in more than one breeding ground before this , and they moved to relatively nearby areas -- eastern to western @entity93 , eastern to western @entity94 , for example			0
" " we have to rearrange the way we feel about the ocean now , " @entity6 said in 2010			1
with more photos to comb through , more discoveries could be made , she said			0
she encouraged anyone who goes on a whale - watching trip to try to take photographs of the whale 's fluke			2
wait much longer than you think you should to click the shutter , though , because the fluke becomes visible just before the whale dives back down into the ocean , she said			0
if you upload the photos to a public photo - sharing website -- @entity13 is just one of many -- and tag them with a date and location , then scientists may be able to use that photo to track the whale on its journeys through the ocean			1
@entity6 said photos of whales in @entity94 and @entity71 are particularly needed			1
taking a photo of a whale can be the start of a lifelong learning experience , she said			2
" whales are a great way to take people down into the ocean			0

volunteers match and *analyze* whale photos on @entity13
citizen scientist discovers record migration on photo - sharing site
@entity6 : more whale photos could lead to new findings
researchers need photos of the underside of whales ' tails , or flukes
