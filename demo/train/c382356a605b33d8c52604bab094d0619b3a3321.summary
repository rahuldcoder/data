-- it worked in 2005 with @entity2 , the impassioned pleas of @entity5 school children and the promise that an @entity8 in the @entity10 capital would " inspire a generation			1
" it worked -- four years later -- with the prospect of a historic games in @entity14 when @entity15 convinced the @entity16 ( @entity16 ) of @entity17 's suitably to host the world 's greatest sporting event			1
so on saturday , what will representatives from @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23 come up with to convince @entity16 members in @entity26 that their city should be handed the right to host the @entity29 ? " being chosen as a host city is a gold medal , " @entity30 , a veteran of three successful @entity8 bid campaigns , told @entity0			1
" not all cities can host them , not all countries have the economic strength to be able to do it			0
" @entity30 is something of an @entity8 king - maker			1
it began when he was appointed the director of communications and public affairs for @entity5 's ultimately successful 2012 bid , before he set up his own strategic communications company @entity45 in 2006			0
since then , @entity46 has contributed to the success of @entity15 's bid to host the @entity49 and @entity51 's winning campaign for the 2018 @entity8 in @entity52			1
@entity46 's list of accomplishments also includes advising on @entity56 ' election into the @entity57 and a significant contribution to @entity60 's bid to host the 2022 football @entity61			0
" we 're very proud of our record , " @entity30 said before jetting off to @entity26 , where he hopes to see the @entity63 -- another @entity46 client -- successfully lobby for the inclusion of their sport in the @entity68			0
" there 's a danger with cities that they say they need the @entity8 , but that 's not the question			1
" the question is why do the @entity8 need your city ? what can you bring to the @entity8 , @entity8 sport , the @entity8 movement ? how can you make it different ? @entity15 's @entity8 village is delicious eye candy " ultimately that is what we would call a narrative that will allow you to bring your story to life			1
" @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23 will all be desperate for their cities to write the 2020 chapter of the @entity8 tale			1
each location will hope to tell its own compelling story			0
the @entity99 capital of @entity22 is proposing a games on a comparatively modest budget of $ 2 billion , with the aim of stimulating the economy of a country still wrestling with a financial crisis that has gone on for several years			1
@entity21 , with a reported mega-budget of $ 20 billion , is tantalizingly positioned across two vast markets in @entity108 and @entity109			1
and then there is @entity23 's futuristic pitch epitomized by plans for a space - age @entity113 and the promise of a first " @entity100			1
" so what factors will woo over 100 voting @entity16 members ? " every bid is different , " said @entity30			1
" i think we set a new benchmark in modern campaigning with @entity122			0
" the focus was very much on inspiring young people , reconnecting @entity8 sport with the next generation			2
that was a theme with @entity5 right from the beginning			0
" with @entity15 it was a focus on a games of transformation and celebration			0
@entity15 was ready , investment in the city would be very significant and also bringing the @entity8 to @entity14 for the first time			1
" @entity51 , @entity52 was the gateway to the @entity108 market , @entity108 fans and the next generation of @entity8 competitors			2
@entity52 was the platform to do that			0
" however , each city 's @entity8 fairytale must first address concerns over their readiness to stage the @entity8			1
@entity99 's financial situation remains precarious , while @entity23 's bid team is facing questions and growing concerns over the radiation leak at the @entity153 nuclear plant			2
anti-government protests swept through the streets of @entity21 in june and july , with tear gas and water cannons used by the police to halt demonstrators			2
against the backdrop of political and financial unrest , campaigning for the right to hold a sporting event must strike a delicate balance			0
while the rewards and prestige of hosting the @entity168 are enormous -- it is safe to say the legacy of staging the @entity8 can breathe new life into a country -- there are plenty of dangers			2
" you 've got to bid for the event that 's right for your city or your country at that time , " said @entity30			1
" cities should n't come into a race without understanding the scale of what is involved			0
just bidding is an expensive exercise			0
" i 'm certainly not one who believes more major cities should be bidding for the @entity8 and @entity188			1
they are a massive commitment and a golden prize			0
" as @entity5 showed , they can be a major boost to a city and to the image and brand of a country			0
they can make a different to the landscape			0
" in the final hours before saturday 's vote , @entity30 urges the bidding cities to hone their narrative to strike the right chord			2
after all , the chance to stage an @entity8 arrives just once in a generation			2
" you need to be able to show that technically you 're good , but also you 've got a real edge and story which makes you an attractive option for the @entity16 , " he explained			2
" ultimately , it is clear cities are interested in bidding and we have three strong cities in the 2020 race			2
" already cities are lining up for the 2022 @entity8 and even the @entity217			0
it is clear there is interest across the globe in hosting an @entity8			0
