-- @entity2 leaders are meeting to attempt to resolve the debt crisis in @entity4 and prevent it infecting other countries -- an outcome that could potentially tear apart the 17 - member eurozone and lead to another global economic slump			1
so what can they hope to achieve , what 's behind the crisis and how serious is it ? who is meeting and why ? @entity15 leaders are gathering in @entity16 , including @entity18 president @entity17 and @entity20 chancellor @entity19			1
they are meeting to discuss ways to bring @entity4 's spiraling debt problem under control , chiefly through a multi-billion dollar bailout package			1
they are also addressing concerns that @entity4 's woes could infect other eurozone countries			1
why is @entity4 in trouble ? years of unrestrained spending , cheap lending and a failure to implement financial reforms left @entity4 badly exposed when the global economic downturn struck			1
this revealed partly - fiddled statistics that showed debt levels and deficits exceeded eurozone limits			2
as the dust settled , it emerged that @entity4 is teetering on the brink of default as it faces debts of about $ 500 billion			2
it has become reliant on international funds to make repayments			0
how bad is it ? bad enough to warrant an initial $ 145 billion bail out last year			0
now , with the crisis showing no sign of abating , another multi-billion dollar bail out is in on the table			0
the initial package assumed @entity4 would eventually be able to borrow again from the open market , but high lending rates mean this has been impossible and a second rescue is needed			2
this , however , will only be forthcoming if @entity2 leaders can agree on terms			1
why is the rest of @entity2 worried ? @entity4 's woes reflect badly on the credibility of the euro			1
a default from @entity4 is also bound to rekindle fears of possible defaults by other bailed - out euro nations , like @entity69 and @entity70 , and re-ignite the debate on whether the eurozone can survive			1
see a map of @entity2 's debt levels this could knock the whole bloc into the red , affecting the global economy			1
and if @entity2 countries continue to resort to rescue packages involving bodies such as the @entity83 , this would further damage the euro 's reputation and could lead to a substantial fall against other key currencies , especially the @entity89 dollar			1
why is the second bailout package a problem ? the eurozone 's leading economy @entity20 has been at loggerheads with the rest of @entity2 over how @entity4 should repay its spiraling debt			1
@entity20 has been pushing for a " soft restructuring " of @entity4 's loans -- a move that would make private investors share the burden -- but the @entity102 has warned any compulsory restructuring could lead to a broader crisis			1
talks between finance ministers have until now failed to reach consensus , resulting in the latest summit between eurozone leaders			2
can a deal be reached ? early indications are favorable			0
@entity17 and @entity19 -- arguably the two most influential participants -- have reportedly thrashed out a possible solution ahead of the summit			1
details are n't clear but the @entity116 says they have already run the plan past @entity119 president @entity118 and @entity120 , the president of the @entity102			0
that said , many @entity2 leaders involved in the talks will be wary of agreeing to anything that commits them to using public cash to fund the bailouts			1
some are also likely to argue that any deal reached now can only be palliative , failing to stop the crisis spreading at a later date			2
what are the likely solutions ? there are several possibilities			0
the most basic fix would see a reduction in interest payments made by @entity4 on earlier rescue loans and a fresh bailout of about $ 150 billion to plug impending holes in the @entity4 economy			2
another option is a rollover of debt -- which would buy time , but not solve the problem			0
there is also talk of a controversial $ 42 billion tax on banks			0
this would raise bailout money without putting a strain on the public purse , but would involve a major legal shake up across the eurozone			0
also up for discussion is a $ 628 billion expansion of eurozone crisis funds to deal with further problems			2
what if no deal is reached ? the doomday scenario sees a dramatic slide in confidence as investors retreat from @entity2 financial markets			1
this pushes up the cost of borrowing across the region , triggering new fears about the threat of debt crises in @entity175 and @entity176			0
this begins to drag on countries with debt exposure to @entity175 and @entity176			0
eventually , the whole eurozone could be pushed the brink , generating financial shockwaves across the world that will herald a new global economic slump			1
what is @entity4 doing to help itself ? to be fair , @entity4 is n't standing idly by			2
it has already imposed hugely unpopular austerity measures against an explosive backdrop of public discontent			0
it is also taking drastic steps to ease its debt burden by selling off numerous assets			0
it is looking at an extensive privatization program that could see it unload prized assets including stakes in banks , railways , utility firms , ports and the postal service			0
there is also a plan to offload @entity202 , @entity204 ' former international airport			0
other measures include floating @entity207 and tourism property assets on the stock exchange and issuing gaming licenses			0
the target is to raise about $ 71 billion by 2015 .			0

@entity2 leaders are meeting in @entity16 to try to solve @entity4 's economic crisis
@entity18 's @entity17 and @entity20 's @entity19 have reportedly thrashed out a plan ahead of summit
any deal will have to address threat of @entity2 - wide contagion leading to global financial slump
