apart from what they do for the military ; drones have already proven themselves capable sheep herders , delivery boys , tour guides , filmmakers , archaeologists , and -- possibly -- spies			0
the global economic potential of these machines is astounding ; a recent study estimated the worldwide market for unmanned aerial vehicles ( @entity15 ) at $ 89 billion in 2013			1
proponents are eager to point out the many ways they 're going to make our lives better			0
" really , this technology is an extra tool to help an industry be more effective , " says @entity20 , the executive vice president for the @entity21 ( @entity21 )			1
" with precision agriculture , for example , it can take pictures of fields so farmers can identify problems they would n't necessarily see walking through the fields			0
in law enforcement , you could find a child lost in the woods more easily than walking through a field , particularly if there 's bad weather or treacherous ground			0
" while it may seem that drones are set to take over our lives , the reality is a bit more complicated			0
drone usage around the world is definitely picking up in the public sector , but when it comes to commercial activity , many countries have strict limitations			1
opinion : bad laws could hurt good drones the @entity55 does n't allow for commercial drone usage at all , though that 's expected to change in 2015 , when the @entity58 ( @entity58 ) aims to put a plan in place to integrate drones in @entity55 airspace			1
in the meantime , says @entity63 , the @entity55 is losing $ 10 billion in potential economic impact for every year the @entity58 delays			1
" i think the @entity55 has been the leader in this technology , and i think there 's a risk of losing that first - mover aspect the longer we wait on regulations , " she says			2
" a lot of countries are allowing for flight , and that puts us at a disadvantage			0
we 're seeing @entity55 manufacturers realize they 're developing great products they ca n't use here , and they 're looking to overseas to fulfill their business model			2
" currently , civilian drone use in the @entity55 is only sanctioned in a handful of incidents , namely in the public sector , as research or as a hobby , though the latter dictates they do n't fly above 400 feet , near populated areas or outside of the operator 's line of vision			1
while this means that ostensibly , non-military manufactures are restricted to making hobby models , most of these can take on commercial applications			0
" we 're amazed at the uses that pop up , " says @entity104 , a spokesperson at @entity105 -- an @entity55 manufacturer of hobbyists @entity15			2
in addition to catering to enthusiasts locally , @entity104 estimates that half their business is done overseas in countries with fewer restrictions			2
one of the most open countries , she notes , is @entity116			2
the @entity117 recently made headlines when @entity116 start - ups @entity119 and @entity121 announced they would team up to provide textbook deliveries via drones by next year			0

despite the infancy of the industry , many lawmakers fear the potential invasion of privacy that drones portend			1
nine @entity55 states have already passed laws restricting drone use , both in the hands of private citizens and law enforcement agencies			1
" drones make surveillance cheaper and easier , and when you do that , you can expect to see a lot more of it , " warns @entity143 , a law professor at the @entity144 and an affiliate scholar at the @entity146			0
while @entity143 argues that the ease with which the government can spy on us " should be a concern " , he also says that drones could be useful in starting a long overdue conversation about privacy law			1
" @entity161 law has lagged behind surveillance technology for years , and it probably has to do with the fact that citizens ca n't envision what the problem is , but they can picture what drone surveillance would feel like , " he says			0
as a result , he argues , drones " could be a catalyst for better privacy law			1

though drones have *incredible* commercial potential , most countries restrict its use
the @entity55 is expected to open up drones for commercial use by 2015
@entity21 estimates the @entity55 loses $ 10 billion yearly by delaying drone integration
though drones bring up privacy concerns , some argue it could advance privacy law
