-- in an entertainment environment where sequels often do better than the original , it could be considered risky for a gaming company to do something different			2
however , one team thinks it 's the perfect environment to showcase new ideas and stories , not more of the same			0
" @entity17 " ( @entity18 , @entity19 ) is a brand new title set in a steampunk - like world that puts players in the role of an assassin set on restoring his name			1
co-creator @entity20 said he and co-creator @entity21 did n't set out solely to make something unique , but that the game evolved from a core set of values they knew they wanted the game to have			1
" it 's a weird blend of a first - person shooter , but has the ( role - playing game ) depth in story and narrative , " @entity20 said			1
" people would say , ' are n't you afraid of ( competing with ) the sequels ? ' but other people would say , ' thank goodness it is n't a sequel			1
' " @entity20 said the team just started spitballing ideas about games they would like to play without worrying about sales or marketing			1
in what he calls an organic process , @entity20 and @entity21 took their experiences from previous games they worked on and decided to focus on an environment based around historical @entity55 in the 1800s during the @entity58 era			1
with the help of their visual design and art team , the look of the game changed into something of a " retro - futuristic " design , and with it , a change in what they wanted to do with the gameplay itself			1
it was during this phase @entity20 and @entity21 began fleshing out the details and narrative of " @entity17			1
" the idea of having two distinct ways to play , and succeed , in the game became the focus			1
but with that came problems , because it 's a unique approach			1
@entity20 said many of the early problems with designing the game came because they were developing a new and different world			1
" there 's a different religion			0
there 's a different calendar			0
there are different continental maps , " he said			0
" i get why people want to work with a particular ( established ) brand because it solves a lot of problems going forward			0
" ( but ) from a creative standpoint , it is super refreshing to work on something new and let it take you where your passions take you -- to not be beholden to some past thing you 've done			0
" the process of creating something new is time consuming since there is no background material to help get a jump on designs			0
even when early artwork started getting a steampunk look to it , @entity20 wanted to stay true to being original -- " @entity116 © d steampunk			1
" instead , he prodded the artists to think about a version of the alternate - history style that might exist on a completely different world			2
one idea led to another , @entity20 said			0
but even with the game 's aesthetic fixed , there was still gameplay style to create from scratch			2
they settled on two possible approaches : combat or stealth			0
" there were moments when we would look at the combat and it would n't be working just right , " he said			0
" i ca n't tell you how many versions of the stealth model we went through			0
but the range is very deliberate ; it is one of our core values to let players play improvisationally			2
" @entity20 said giving players the opportunity to write their own story and create their own experience with such a wide range of possibilities was important			0
@entity149 , vice president of pr and marketing at @entity19 , said " @entity17 " is a blank slate where players get to define the game instead of having a narrative forced upon them			1
" you play the game you want to play , " @entity149 said			1
" it is really up to you based on your choices			0
what would it be like to be a supernatural badass assassin ? " @entity149 said with new environments and game mechanics , players get challenged			2
because the world is n't as familiar as it may be in a game that has had sequel after sequel , they can play again and experience something fresh and new each time			1
he compares the game , in a way , to the " @entity173 " books			2
" our tag line is ' @entity176 ' , " he said			0
" but that does n't mean killing solves everything			0
they 've put in place consequences to the choices you can make			0
" @entity20 said how players go about completing the main narrative -- reclaiming your name and honor after being falsely accused of killing the empress -- will have an impact on what happens in the end			0
he said the emergent narrative , where things spontaneously occur due to what players do in the game , becomes something unique that gamers will take away from their experience			2
with games like " @entity201 , " " @entity202 , " and " @entity203 : enemy unknown , " @entity20 thinks gamers are evolving			2
they want games with depth , he said , without sacrificing sheer entertainment value			1
" players have gotten fluent and thirsty for more interactivity , " @entity20 said			0
" ' @entity17 ' is an interesting game			1
it is a game that does n't play itself			1
twenty years ago , that may have been a challenge			0
i think increasingly you are going to see more players want that sort of thing			2
" " @entity17 " will be released tuesday , october 9 , in @entity220 , october 11 in @entity221 and @entity222 , and october 12 in @entity223			1
it is available on @entity225 , @entity226 and @entity227 .			0

bucking sequel trend , " @entity17 " takes a new approach
game creators riffed on games they *'d* like to play , started with clean slate
@entity236 is a sort of *combination* : a first - person shooter with role - playing game depth
" @entity17 " hits stores on tuesday
