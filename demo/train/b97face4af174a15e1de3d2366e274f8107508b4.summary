@entity1 , @entity2 @entity0 kicked off his first event in @entity2 this year with a rally that let him blaze through his favorite libertarian - leaning talking points and draw a contrast between himself and his potential @entity9 rivals			1
" you 're going to get a choice on who the nominee is for the @entity9			2
you 're going to have 9 , 10 , 15 , 20 who are eager to go and want troops on the ground , " he said , talking about the war against @entity16 extremism			2
" they want 100,000 troops on the ground			0
" the @entity24 @entity9 had a rough week but found a friendly audience friday night headlining an " @entity34 " rally at @entity27 in @entity1 , an event packed with many of his father 's supporters and hosted by a group called @entity33			2
it was a curious strategy for a man who 's trying to build a broad coalition of voters behind him , but he assured supporters that he has n't strayed far from his roots			1
" some of you may remember i sued the president , " he said , pointing to a lawsuit he launched last year against the @entity43 over its bulk metadata collection effort			0
he did n't , however , mention that the lawsuit has been put on hold , or that he voted against a reform package in @entity50 last year because he felt it did n't go far enough in tweaking the agency			2
@entity0 , who faced criticism this week over comments expressing doubt about the effectiveness of vaccinations and took heat over drama involving one of his advisers , is in @entity2 on a quick two - day swing that puts him in front of familiar audiences			1
following the " @entity34 " rally friday night , he attends the @entity68 men 's basketball game saturday , as well as a watch party with young voters and a meet - and - greet with freshman rep. @entity71			1
@entity0 is one of many @entity9 who will barnstorm the state in the coming months , seeking support ahead of @entity33 's first - in - the - nation presidential nominating contest a year from now			1
while it 's his first time in the state this year , @entity0 visited @entity2 five times last cycle , and has indicated he plans to make the state a big part of his 2016 strategy			1
his father , ex-texas rep. @entity82 , built a solid foundation of supporters in @entity2 during his 2008 and 2012 campaigns , a base that @entity0 is trying to court while also making inroads with the mainstream and socially conservative @entity9 in the state			1
a @entity93 / @entity92 poll earlier this week showed @entity0 in second place at 14 % support among likely @entity9 caucus goers , behind @entity98 gov. @entity97 at 15 %			2
along with repeating familiar refrains that hammer @entity100 and the president 's executive action on immigration , @entity0 brandished his anti-war credentials			1
he sought to remind the audience that he caused headaches in the @entity107 in december by forcing a vote that would declare war against @entity110 , but stressed that he voted no. " i said we have to debate this			0
and they -- can i say bitched and moaned ? they bitched and moaned and were so unhappy with me that i brought that up			0
but we made a vote , " he said			0
" every time we 've toppled a secular dictator , we 've gotten chaos and we 've gotten a rise in radical @entity16 , and we 've been less safe , " he added			0
@entity0 , attempting to balance his anti-government persona with his efforts to appear bipartisan , pointed out that he 's still been " willing to work with the president " on criminal justice reform , noting that the same day he sued the administration , @entity0 sat down for lunch with attorney general @entity125			1
" he looks at me and says , ' i see you 're suing me and the president today			0
' i said , ' well , you know , we can still be friends right ? ' " @entity0 offered some rare praise for @entity125 , saying at the end he " did some good things on criminal justice , " but warned that he may be replaced by current nominee @entity136 , saying she 's not strong enough on reforming civil forfeiture			1
the main thrust of the event was rallying support behind his new legislation to audit the @entity142			0
it is already audited by a third - party accounting firm arranged through the inspector general and partially by the @entity147 , but @entity0 's bill would give full auditing power to the @entity147 and would require regular reports to @entity50			1
" is there a revolving door between @entity153 , the fed , and back to @entity153 again ? " @entity0 asked , twirling his arm in the air			2
the bill last year passed the @entity9 - controlled @entity157 with bipartisan support but was blocked by the @entity159 - led @entity107			0
critics , including @entity142 chairwoman @entity161 , have vowed to aggressively fight such efforts			0
emboldened by the new @entity50 , however , @entity0 feels that the legislation has a better shot at breaking through and making it to the president 's desk			1
" i think there needs to be some sunshine			0
i 'm going to fight ' em and we 're going to get a vote on @entity34 , " he said to applause .			0

@entity0 makes first 2015 trip to @entity2 , home of first presidential caucuses
he 's trying to build a broad coalition of voters , but says he has n't strayed far from his roots
