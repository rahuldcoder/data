-- it is such a cruel disease , one that can sneak up on a person and catch him unawares			2
the last time i saw @entity7 , he seemed just fine			1
the name will be familiar to many of you , but today 's column is intended just as much for those readers who are too young to remember him			1
he was one of the young rock - and - roll idols of the early 1960s			2
his hits included " @entity16 , " " @entity17 , " " @entity18 " and " @entity19			2
" he continued to tour as the years went by			2
we were on an @entity22 ocean liner in the first weeks of 2009			2
the ship had been booked by a company presenting a different early - years - of - rock act in concert each evening in the big theater onboard			2
@entity7 was one of the performers ; i was there with the @entity32 band			1
one midnight after the show , somewhere off the coast of the @entity35 , i was walking around an upper deck and saw that @entity7 was taking a walk , too			1
we met up and talked about some of his first recordings			2
his recall was precise and acute ; he gave me details of what the sessions had been like			2
he is a gentleman , and a gentle man			2
walking and talking with him was a wonderful way to end the day at sea			0
so i was startled to hear recently that he is battling alzheimer 's disease , the irreversible , progressive brain disorder that destroys memory and thinking skills			1
it is estimated that more than 5 million @entity56 suffer from it , a number that is only expected to increase unless advances in treatment and prevention are achieved			0
the federal government recently announced new initiatives that , it is hoped , will add urgency to the efforts			0
the millions of families dealing with @entity67 's are aware of its devastation			1
but when people with familiar names -- @entity73 , @entity74 -- are blindsided by it , the world tends to stop , and think , and try to learn			0
what we can learn from @entity7 is how to face adversity with genuine grace and perspective			1
he is 69 ; in a letter to his friends and fans , he said that it was a little over a year ago that he was diagnosed with the initial stages of @entity67 's			1
getting the news , he said , " was a moment that stunned my family and myself to the core			1
since this time i have chosen to remain private and to focus on what is most important to me : my family and my music			1
it has been a time to reflect and to just be			1
to create memories for my grandchildren and to celebrate life 's goodness			1
to throw baseballs and catch fish			0
... " shortly after this all came down , i hopped into an rv with my family and we embarked on a little odyssey from @entity108 to @entity109 , @entity110			1
together we explored the depths of our reality			0
... the depths of my reality			0
with very few words , no solutions and a lot of heart , we did what we do			0
we shared laughter , tears , stories , meals and music			0
we shared thousands of miles of hi - way as familiar to us as the pillows on our beds			0
as if nothing had changed , as if everything had changed			0
... " so without a song or a script i am stepping onto a stage that we all share : the mystery of life			0
while in @entity109 we set up some amps and drums in the garage ... we just did what we have always done , only this time there was no stage			1
there were no spotlights and no audience			0
we made music every day for a week ... just for us			0
for the joy of making music			0
for the joy of being together			0
for all of the reasons i ever picked up a guitar or sang a tune in a @entity153 , @entity152 garage back in ' 59			0
i have truly come full circle ! we played songs i grew up with , songs the kids grew up with , songs we wrote , songs that had meaning and memories for us all			0
no agenda , no set list , no tickets to sell ... this was all we have ever done , and all we could do			0
" when you are young you never think that @entity67 's will enter your own life			1
but unless something is done to defeat the disease , years from now people who are today young and strong will be fighting it , and -- when the disease strikes their favorite actors , athletes and singers who are in 2012 so full of youth and energy , and who will inevitably grow old -- they , too , will be reminded of the passing years , and of life 's memories lost and found			2
@entity7 was at one time the kid wonder of kid wonders			1
he was only 15 when , the night after @entity183 and @entity184 and the @entity185 died in that 1959 @entity187 charter - plane crash , he was recruited to somehow help make the show go on at the tour 's next stop in @entity191 , @entity108			2
he and his friends from nearby @entity153 filled in that night , and his career began			2
he and his band were much admired in that @entity108 / @entity152 area			0
a young piano player , wanting to make music with @entity7 , showed up and asked to play in some shows			1
he said his name was @entity200 , which it was n't			0
later he would choose another name : @entity203			0
in @entity203 's autobiography , he writes with great regard , warmth and true professional respect for @entity208 , starting with the days when they were both little more than kids ( " @entity7 and me had a lot in common , even though our paths would take such different directions ... @entity7 had a metallic , edgy tone to his voice and it was as musical as a silver bell			1
these are especially tense hours for the @entity7 family			1
he wrote in that letter about his @entity67 's diagnosis : " my beautiful wife of 48 years , @entity226 , is also dealing with serious health issues as we await a lung transplant for her at @entity229			1
" last week , @entity7 's son @entity230 told me that the operation had been performed the night before , and that the family is praying for the best outcome			1
as @entity7 neared the end of the letter to his friends and fans , he wrote : " we thank you from the bottom of our hearts for every musical moment we 've shared			1
it has truly been a magical odyssey			0
we have been blessed ... and the road goes on			0
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity247 .			1

@entity247 says 60 's pop star @entity7 is suffering from @entity67 's
he says since diagnosis , @entity7 has tried to spend good time with friends , family
in letter to friends , fans , he writes *movingly* about his new priorities as his memory fails
@entity247 : any of us could get @entity67 's . @entity208 's grace in handling his is *inspirational*
