-- when international supermodel @entity1 took the witness stand friday in the trial against @entity5 's former president @entity4 , western media outlets showered unprecedented attention on this largely ignored war crimes trial			1
but many witnesses besides @entity1 have testified since the trial began in january 2008			1
judges have heard accounts of bravery and fortitude by ordinary civilians whose limbs were amputated , who were raped or forced into slavery ; stories of horrifying acts of wickedness by faction commanders and their fighters ; and the unsavory involvement of outsiders , often business opportunists			1
these business leaders ' willingness to seek profit in diamonds , timber , rubber or weapons on the back of the war is shocking			1
yet despite the dramatic and horrifying nature of this testimony , the trial garnered only minimal @entity38 media coverage			0
that is , until the trial took a surprising twist , with supermodel @entity1 and actress @entity42 testifying about a dinner in @entity44 that happened nearly 13 years ago			1
at that dinner , then - newly elected president @entity4 allegedly gave the supermodel a parcel of rough diamonds			1
the judges will ultimately determine what exactly happened that night and how it relates to @entity4 's case			1
but the @entity53 - diamond saga might bring public attention to an issue that goes far beyond the celebrities and even the trial itself			2
the supermodel , perhaps unintentionally , said it best when she described the gift she received at that dinner in @entity44			0
she called them " dirty little stones " unfamiliar to her because she was used to seeing diamonds " shiny and in a box			2
" @entity1 's comment spoke not only of her relative na√Øvety , but of the troubling nexus between @entity38 economies and some of the world 's worst resource - based conflicts and most corrupt regimes , particularly in @entity44			1
the wars in @entity5 and @entity74 were perhaps the first and most vivid examples of the new nature of @entity78 conflicts in @entity44			0
the @entity5 civil war and eventually the larger regional war involving four neighboring countries started on december 24 , 1989 , the day that some mark as the end of the @entity84			2
the old client patronage support system for belligerents quickly evaporated			0
commercial entities and transnational organized criminal networks , often overlapping , filled the void , providing weapons and a market for resources that sustained military campaigns conducted by both governments and rebel forces			0
in @entity5 , it was timber , rubber and gold			0
in @entity74 , it was diamonds			0
but the pattern was evident in other wars as well , whether it was diamonds , oil , timber , or even rare minerals like coltan , used in today 's cell phones			1
commentators in the @entity110 typically point to the corruption and human rights abuses of @entity114 leaders , as if this happens in isolation			0
but it is a two - way street			0
in nearly every armed conflict or instance of a highly corrupt regime coupled with some desired resource , a network of outsiders extending from organized criminal networks to reputable financial institutions facilitates and exacerbates some of the world 's worst abuses			1
this is not simply about a few unsavory businessmen willing to make back - room deals			0
it is also about major international financial institutions that exercise little due - diligence as they oppose stricter transparency regulations			0
it 's about major corporations that transact with shell companies representing criminal networks , or that make payments to off - budget bank accounts			0
in short , it involves the " see no evil " approach by some of the world 's largest mineral extraction , oil and financial institutions			1
for the people of @entity74 and @entity5 , @entity1 's association with this whole affair is of little consequence			1
but it is a cruel reminder of another stark fact : in the years of war that engulfed both countries , not only were thousands of innocent lives lost and people maimed , not only were women and girls raped or made sex slaves , not only were children conscripted to fight , but the people 's resources also were stolen out from under them and never returned			2
the diamond industry has given almost nothing back to @entity74 , despite the critical role diamonds played in the war			2
the same is true for segments of the timber industry that profited from the deforestation of @entity5 during the war			0
i hope the recent media attention surrounding @entity1 will last beyond fashion critiques of the custom - fitted suit , bouffant hairstyle and high - heeled shoes she wore to court , and chatter of a celebrity feud between her and @entity42			2
instead , i hope @entity1 's appearance at court will raise awareness about a truly significant and profound issue -- how some within the affluent economies of the world profit from the world 's worst conflicts and their " dirty little stones			1
" the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity194 .			0

@entity194 : @entity1 brought attention to @entity4 's war crimes trial
