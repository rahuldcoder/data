@entity0 , @entity1 -- those fundamentalist members of the @entity5 government who have long sought to blow up any possibility for the normalization of relations between @entity9 and @entity10 may just have succeeded			2
at the very least they are likely to have put any negotiations with @entity5 on issues ranging from nuclear power to the @entity15 insurrection and the @entity17 counterattack in @entity18 on the back burner			2
an @entity20 , @entity21 , has been charged in a plot to assassinate the @entity24 ambassador to the @entity25			1
according to @entity25 authorities , the plot included hiring a @entity28 informant posing as a member of a @entity31 drug cartel who asked for $ 1.5 million to explode a bomb in a restaurant frequented by the @entity24 ambassador			1
the @entity20 allegedly had been recruited and directed by his cousin , @entity36 , a senior member of the @entity38 of the @entity39 ( @entity39 ) in @entity5 , and by @entity36 's deputy , @entity40			1
@entity21 was recruited in early spring and began arranging the terror plot in late may of this year using monies wired from @entity5 at the direction of the @entity5 government , prosecutors revealed			1
@entity40 has also been charged in absentia in the criminal complaint that was filed by the @entity48 in the @entity49 of the @entity50			0
the @entity5 government has denied any involvement			0
while in @entity52 for the @entity54 meetings last month , @entity5 president @entity55 and his foreign minister @entity56 suggested that relations between @entity9 and @entity59 governments need to improve			0
they also indicated that negotiations over @entity5 's nuclear program should be re-started			0
their recent comments came on the heels of several months of outreach by the @entity5 president 's office to the @entity25 and @entity69			1
the current terror plot may have been , in part , an attempt by others within the @entity5 government to sabotage those discussions before they can begin			1
the @entity25 is expected to ask that the @entity75 impose additional sanctions against @entity5 for the terror plot			1
the @entity39 was founded after the @entity5 revolution of 1979			1
it complements , supplements and often eclipses @entity5 's regular military forces in resources , manpower , tactics , and operations			0
the @entity39 's overall commander , gen. @entity86 , who was appointed by and is loyal to @entity5 's supreme leader @entity87 , recently threatened " military action against all other who disavow the @entity90			1
" another @entity39 officer , @entity91			0
gen. @entity92 -- who like @entity86 is under international sanctions but still heads the influential economic wing of the @entity39 ( which controls approximately 50 percent of @entity5 's economy ) -- is also @entity5 's minister of petroleum and so currently serves as president of the @entity97 ( @entity97 )			1
the @entity39 's @entity38 is a special unit utilized for enforcing militant fundamentalism at home , ensuring the mullahs stay in power to the dismay of many @entity5 citizens , exporting the @entity39 revolution to other nations , supporting @entity5 's political cronies abroad and conducting terrorist attacks against foreign targets			1
the @entity38 reports directly to @entity110 , who appointed its commander @entity91			0
gen. @entity112 -- another @entity5 official listed as a terrorist by the @entity25 government			2
@entity112 is suspected by the @entity25 government of helping shape the terror plot just thwarted by the @entity25 the @entity39 generally and its @entity38 specifically have been implicated in several terrorist attacks on @entity25 , @entity118 , and others			1
the july 1994 bombing that killed 85 persons at a @entity122 in @entity123 was traced back by the government of @entity125 ( and even noted in the @entity25 @entity126 ) to the @entity39			2
the june 1996 truck bomb that killed 19 @entity25 servicemen in @entity129 , @entity24 , was believed by the @entity130 to have been assembled at an @entity39 facility and then provided to its partner in crime @entity133 , which carried out the attack			1
the @entity39 has trained and armed not only the @entity136 @entity133 but also @entity138 @entity137 , @entity140 militants in @entity15 , and even @entity17 fighters in @entity18			0
now it is suspected of sharing tactics and weapons with @entity145 's troops against protestors in @entity148 's current populist uprising			0
so , many of the @entity39 's international activities are aimed at weakening the @entity25 and preventing @entity25 attempts to stabilize the @entity152 and @entity153			1
the choice of a @entity24 diplomat as the plot 's target is not surprising			2
@entity24 sent troops to @entity159 in march to put down a rebellion by that island nation 's majority @entity140 population who are tied religiously to @entity9			0
the @entity24 government blames @entity5 for instigating both @entity159 unrest and @entity140 protests in eastern @entity24			2
so , the @entity167 monarchy in @entity168 has been trying to line up a coalition of @entity171 states to oppose @entity5 's ambitions in the @entity152 specifically			0
the timing of @entity21 's recruitment for the terror plot suggests the assassination is also in part tit - for - tat retribution for the @entity24 military action against @entity140 in @entity159			1
planning the plot for @entity10 fits well with hardliners in @entity9 detesting the @entity25 government for threatening military actions and spearheading economic sanctions against @entity5 for its nuclear program			1
the @entity186 computer worm attack on @entity5 's nuclear facilities in june 2010 , and the assassination of @entity5 scientists , all of which are attributed by @entity9 to @entity10 and @entity191 may also have factored into this attempt at retaliation			0
in the wake of the @entity90 many @entity5 from all walks of life fled to @entity197 and @entity198			0
they and their descendants are by and large opposed to the fundamentalist regime in @entity5 and have become loyal citizens of the @entity25 and other countries to which they emigrated			2
so , if the charges are true , the person arrested is an anomaly			0
likewise our own research in @entity5 has shown that most @entity5 feel goodwill toward @entity25 and seek renewal of relations with the @entity25			2
those in @entity9 who plotted these attacks intended to sunder that goodwill between peoples and to further alienate their own citizens from the rest of the world			0
those terrorist masterminds should not be permitted to get away with their plans at home or abroad			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity223 and @entity224 .			0

authors say hardliners in @entity5 may achieve their aim of *scuttling* talks with the @entity25
