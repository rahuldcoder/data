justice @entity0 was among the first of his colleagues to arrive wednesday at the @entity4 @entity3			1
his chambers lit up several hours before the last - day release of monumental rulings on same - sex marriage			0
there was little doubt that later that morning , this quietly powerful justice would be having a major say in the legal , political , and social path of gay rights moving forward			0
and at precisely 10 a.m. , @entity0 kicked off the public session with his eloquent majority ruling striking down a key part of a federal law that blocks a range of benefits for legally married gay and lesbian couples			1
the @entity25 " humiliates tens of thousands of children now being raised by same - sex couples , " he said			2
" the law in question makes it even more difficult for the children to understand the integrity and closeness of their own family and its concord with other families in their community and in their daily lives			0
" what 's next for gay rights movement ? it was vintage @entity0 -- a mix of sweeping rhetoric mixed with practical legal and social considerations			1
" if @entity45 was ' the first black president , ' @entity0 has now firmly secured his place in history as ' the first gay justice , ' " said @entity42 , a law professor at @entity43 and a former @entity0 law clerk			1
" @entity49 makes clear that he not only accepts , but welcomes the task of writing majestic opinions affirming the dignity of gay persons and couples			0
" by the @entity55 : same - sex marriage @entity0 , a moderate - conservative , is in many ways the " power broker " on the court			1
he shared the role of a " swing vote " with fellow centrist @entity62 before she retired seven years ago			1
" the basic principle is , it 's @entity49 's world and you just live in it , " said @entity63 , a private attorney who publishes the well - read @entity64			0
" @entity62 , having been the most powerful woman in the world , handed the keys to him on her way out the door and said , ' have fun			1
' and he took up that invitation			0
" the thinking goes that with four solid conservatives aligned on the right and four liberals on the left , @entity0 is the man in the middle , often able to cast the deciding vote in contentious cases , assuring his views of the law prevail			1
@entity0 has crafted a powerful , if hard to define , judicial legacy -- seemingly in the forefront of every major ruling during his tenure			2
as an unapologetic " swing " vote , he was the key behind - the - scenes architect of the 2000 @entity95 drama , and a 1992 opinion upholding abortion rights			0
he has written majority decisions upholding rights to homosexual couples , underage killers , and foreign fighters held by the @entity4 military in the war on terror			0
that was true this past term in several other hot - button cases in which he played a key role by : writing the majority opinion allowing for the continued but limited use of race in the college admissions process , yet making it harder for institutions to use such policies to achieve diversity			1
siding with his fellow conservatives to strike down a key section of the @entity119 , weakening federal oversight of states and counties with a past history of discrimination of minority voters at the polls			0
concluding criminal suspects can be subjected to a police dna test after arrest but before trial and conviction			0
blocking a lawsuit by privacy advocates challenging the federal government 's sweeping electronic eavesdropping on suspected foreign terrorists and spies			0
@entity0 was in the majority 91 % of the time in the court 's 78 argued cases this term , more than any justice			1
in divided cases -- where there was no unanimity -- he was on the winning side 83 % , again tops on the court			0
sometimes he sides with his more liberal colleagues , as he did in the @entity25 case , but he is mostly a reliable conservative vote , especially on business and regulation disputes			2
that unpredictability has long made liberals and conservatives equally nervous , but many on the right are more outspoken in their disappointment in the @entity161 nominee , who turns 77 in july			2
" @entity0 's style as the ' @entity0 ' is often as a ' justice in a muddle , ' " said @entity162 , a law professor at @entity163 and a former lawyer in the @entity161 and @entity166 administrations			1
" he writes cryptically ... suggesting a standard of his own making that is not fully developed			0
" despite the rhetoric , @entity0 's moderating force has generally benefited his conservative colleagues			1
of the 23 divided 5 - 4 cases this term -- including the two marriage cases as well as voting rights -- @entity0 was in the majority 20 times , according to @entity64 , again higher than anyone on the nine - member bench			1
only on six decisions did he side with the four left - leaning justices : @entity186 , @entity187 , @entity188 , and @entity189			0
but it was his majority opinion in the @entity25 case that could have ripple effects for years to come			1
" although justice @entity0 's opinion explicitly states that it is confined to same - sex marriages that have been recognized by states , it contains reasoning and language that will certainly be used , in later cases , to argue that legal recognition of same - sex marriage by all states is constitutionally required , " said @entity195 law professor @entity194 , a past clerk to former chief justice @entity196			1
" almost certainly , and fairly soon , that argument will be presented squarely to the court			2
" what about us , ask other gay couples within the marbled halls of the high court , @entity0 is personally respected by his colleagues , both for the power he wields and for his courtly , low - key manner			1
but professionally , justices on the losing side of a big case can often be unsparing in their criticism of @entity0 and his legal reasoning			2
justice @entity223 on wednesday called @entity0 's analysis in the @entity25 case " jaw dropping " and an assertion of " judicial supremacy " that " envisions the @entity3 standing ( or rather enthroned ) at the apex of government			1
" and this from a close friend -- @entity223 and @entity0 joined the court a year apart , were born the same year , and live on the same street			2
the @entity235 , @entity236 , native joined the high court in 1988 , the third choice of president @entity161 after more conservative nominees @entity240 and @entity241 flamed out			0
and along with @entity62 for almost two decades , the two native @entity242 carved out a jumpy place in the center			2
less driven by practical concerns than @entity62 was , @entity0 has striven for a loftier sense of the law 's impact on society			1
" he has brought to the bench a combination of a very scholarly , erudite , academic bent , " said @entity250 , a friend and former law clerk to @entity0 , " and a very practical bent he had developed while practicing law on his own			0
" @entity0 himself acknowledged the unique role he played for decades on the court			2
" there is a loneliness " to his job , he once told @entity262			0
for now , @entity0 , like his eight colleagues , will retreat from the public spotlight			0
he has some vacation time ahead , mixed with his annual overseas teaching gig in @entity270 in two weeks			0
then , come the first monday october , @entity0 is expected back in his familiar seat , just to the left of chief justice @entity273 on the bench			1
but clearly he is the man in the middle , and the man that in many ways shapes the direction of a divided court .			0

@entity0 wrote majority opinion striking down parts of @entity25
@entity0 and former justice @entity62 were the court 's centrists
when @entity62 *stepped* down seven years ago , she " handed the keys " to @entity0
with four conservatives to the right and four liberals to the left , @entity0 is squarely in middle
