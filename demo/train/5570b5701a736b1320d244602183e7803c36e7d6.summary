@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 and the @entity4 are in the process of finalizing a rescue package worth up to 100 billion euros to bail out @entity1 's banking sector			1
what are the implications of the bailout for @entity1 people and the rest of the world ? when will we know the full details of the rescue package ? over the next few weeks , the exact size of the bailout will be revealed and include details of when it will take effect , and what changes to @entity1 's austerity measures the @entity4 will insist on in exchange for the facility			1
on wednesday , @entity1 prime minister @entity25 announced a tough four - year austerity plan , which included a huge cut in welfare spending , a rise in the @entity30 ( @entity30 ) rate , and thousands of redundancies in the country 's public sector			1
however @entity0 stopped short of changing @entity1 's low corporate tax rate			1
why does @entity1 need the money ? @entity1 needs funds to shore up balance sheets after its government pumped billions of euros into @entity1 banks to keep them afloat , effectively nationalizing most of them			2
the @entity44 is lending money to @entity1 banks because other banks wo n't			0
and lately people and companies have been pulling funds out of the banks			0
this could n't have continued			0
what would the dangers have been if the crisis continued ? a run on @entity1 banks -- mass withdrawals by customers worried their bank will go bust -- would have been bad for the eurozone , as it could have forced the @entity62 and @entity4 to scramble to provide emergency funds within days , rather than in the more orderly , considered way now being organized			1
also if yields ( interest rates ) on @entity1 government bonds kept rising , the same would probably happen to bonds issued by countries such as @entity70 and @entity71 -- this weakens the finances of banks in those countries ( because their large holdings of @entity70 and @entity71 bonds are growing less valuable ) , which will make them inclined to lend less -- which is damaging for the economy			2
what does the bailout mean for @entity1 citizens ? analysts say a bailout is not likely to affect @entity1 citizens directly but will have beneficial effects nonetheless			2
" all it 's going to do is keep the banks going , " said @entity87 of the @entity88			0
" it 's not going to change the objective conditions for the average @entity1 people			1
" but @entity94 , who holds an endowed chair of finance at the @entity97 , says a bailout will make life easier for ordinary folks because the aid might lessen the severity of service cuts the government will need to make			0
" if you imagine that there 's no bailout , the measures that @entity1 would have to take in terms of cutbacks would have to be much more drastic			1
" what will the bailout mean for people across @entity3 ? it means their tax dollars going to pay for yet another bank bailout plan , after the @entity62 bailed out @entity118 to the tune of 110 billion euros ( currently $ 150 billion ) in may			1
but it also means the markets might calm down , taking pressure off @entity70 and @entity71 , which are also facing budget problems			0
bringing the yield on @entity71 and @entity70 government bonds back to normal levels would mean they pay less on interest and more , hopefully , toward reducing their own deficits			0
would it mean anything for @entity133 ? the stock market might regain what it has lost in the past two weeks over " fears of @entity3 recovery			0
" it could also mean the dollar starts to fall against the euro , which might boost @entity133 exports to @entity3 , since @entity133 good would be cheaper for euro - spenders to buy			1
who would pay for an @entity1 bailout ? after @entity118 took @entity3 and @entity4 loans , @entity62 countries pledged nearly $ 1 trillion for any country that ca n't pay its bills by raising funds through normal debt markets			1
@entity1 does not have that problem , but it 's clear the @entity62 will allow @entity1 to pump loans into its banks ( given the government controls them now anyway )			1
@entity62 countries and their taxpayers pay according to their size : @entity162 the most and @entity161 the least			0
the @entity163 and @entity164 , neither of which use the euro currency , have also said they will lend about 8 billion euros and 1 billion euros respectively , to @entity1			1
what strings will be attached to the rescue package ? the extra banking injection will take @entity1 's fiscal deficit from the planned 11.75 percent of gross domestic product in 2010 to as high as 32 percent			1
that 's 10 times higher than the three percent allowed under the @entity174 agreed by the @entity62 when it laid out the foundations of its single currency in 1992			0
the big question was whether the @entity62 and the @entity4 would demand that @entity1 's low level of corporation tax of 12.5 percent -- one of the lowest in the @entity62 -- which helps keep the country competitive , be raised			1
@entity1 has said it alone decides taxes , and decided against any change in its four - year austerity plan			1
the @entity4 and financial markets will be analyzing the details of the plan to reassure themselves that finance minister @entity187 can deliver on his pledge to shrink the fiscal deficit back down to three percent of gdp in 2014			2
so how did @entity1 get into this mess ? @entity1 recorded stunning economic growth during what is known as the " @entity195 " era from around 1993 to 2007 when the global financial crisis hit			2
@entity1 banks , like others around the world , loaned money to people who in some cases could n't pay it back			2
cheap loans created extra demand for housing and as prices surged the construction industry raced to build more			0
@entity210 prices multiplied during the period , making many homeowners impressive profits and generating fat tax receipts for the government			0
however , when the housing bubble burst , consumer spending slowed sharply			0
unemployment tripled from around four percent in 2005 to 11.8 percent in 2009			0
the most recent figure , for september , puts it even higher at 13.7 percent			0
what has been the reaction of @entity1 people towards the bailout ? one of monday 's papers carries the word " humiliation " as part of its headline , and many people are unhappy that the @entity4 has come to town			1
the government is unpopular and it is hard to see how the bailout will help			2
but what people do n't want to see is the @entity4 dictating terms of the budget over the next couple of years			2
the government is trying to reassure voters that will not be the case , but it remains to be seen			0
@entity2 's @entity243 contributed to this report .			0
