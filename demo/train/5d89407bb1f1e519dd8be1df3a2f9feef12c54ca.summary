@entity1 defense officials tuesday pushed back against the notion that @entity3 has used cyberespionage to obtain extensive design information on advanced @entity1 weapons			1
" suggestions that cyberintrusions have somehow led to the erosion of our capabilities or technological edge are incorrect , " said @entity8 press secretary @entity7			1
" we maintain full confidence in our weapons platforms			1
" the @entity8 was responding to a list of weapons systems whose secrets had been compromised by @entity3 cyberespionage , which the @entity23 says was in a confidential report by the @entity25			1
while the extent of the secrets stolen was not clear , the list of compromised weapons in the @entity23 included some of the @entity8 's crown jewels of high - tech fighting : jets like the @entity34 and the @entity42 , anti-missile defenses like the @entity37 and @entity38 systems , the new @entity39 and the @entity41 unmanned surveillance plane			1
contacted by @entity44 , several members of the @entity25 declined to comment			2
former officer allegedly leaked @entity1 military secrets to @entity3 girlfriend but @entity48 , a cyberexpert at the @entity50 , said that @entity3 could use such cyberespionage in several ways that could put @entity1 fighters at risk : to copy weapons technology , counter @entity1 weapons based on that knowledge or even disrupt their operation by interfering with the software that runs them			1
" if you mess with that software , " he said , " the airplane wo n't fly			2
the missile will miss its target and the ship might not get where it was intended to go			2
" rep. @entity69 , @entity70 and chairman of the @entity72 , described cyberespionage as " tremendously serious			1
" " the viciousness , and just the volume of attacks , not only by the @entity3 but @entity78 and others trying to get the blueprints of our most sensitive material is just breathtaking -- and they 're getting better , " he told @entity44 's @entity74			0
he laid out why such attacks might matter			0
" we , in some cases , have to go back for any material that may have been stolen ... and redesign it			0
it costs more money , " he said			0
" it costs billions and billions of dollars extra to try to make sure that we 're staying ahead of our adversaries with technology			1
when they steal it , they leap ahead			1
that means we have to invest more , and change that technology			0
it is a serious problem			0
" in a publicly released portion of the @entity25 's report , the authors warn that cyberwarfare " may impose severe consequences for @entity1 forces engaged in combat , " including @entity1 weapons failing to operate , communications problems , or even planes or satellites potentially crashing			1
one @entity1 official , while acknowledging cyberintrusions from @entity3 , said the claims of design details being compromised were overstated			1
" the idea that somehow whoever the intruders were got the keys to the weapons kingdom is a stretch , " the official said			2
" getting one piece without the rest of the parts makes it hard to build a weapons platform			2
" defense officials also said they have taken steps to address the concerns , and that some of the information about potential breaches was dated			0
@entity133 of @entity134 , a cybersecurity firm that has also been tracking @entity3 military hackers , said that while many key @entity8 installations are well - fortified against hackers , cyberdefenses need to be deployed more widely			1
" there 's a lot of engineering that gets done in an academic setting , " he said			0
" there 's a lot of engineering that gets done at the defense industrial base			0
and a lot of these places have been compromised for over 10 years			2
" the allegation of cyberpenetration comes at a time when @entity3 has been stepping up its efforts to close the gap with the @entity1 in terms of advanced military technology			0
in recent years , @entity3 has tested a missile that knocked out a satellite , conducted test flights of a stealth warplane , deployed its first aircraft carrier and developed an advanced " carrier - killer " missile for warfare against ships			0
@entity3 's embassy in @entity166 did not immediately respond to inquiries from @entity44 about the allegation of stealing secrets			0
but in the past , @entity3 officials have said @entity3 does not conduct cyberespionage on @entity1 agencies or companies .			0
