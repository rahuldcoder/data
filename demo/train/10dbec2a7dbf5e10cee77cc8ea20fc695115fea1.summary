@entity0 -- as a juvenile corrections officer in @entity3 , @entity4 found it rewarding to work with troubled youth and help them turn their lives around			1
the hardest part usually came after their release			2
" they 'd be super excited , ready to start a new life , " she said			2
" they 'd be put in the exact same environment , though , so they 'd reoffend , and they 'd come back			0
" sometimes , @entity4 said , they would call and say they wanted to come back			1
" that would break my heart , " she said			0
" i 'd be all tough during the day and drive home at night and cry			0
" @entity4 felt that by sending these young men home without enough support to keep them on the right track , the system was essentially setting them up to fail			1
finding a well - paying job can be a tough proposition when you have a criminal record , @entity4 said			1
she wanted to provide an alternative to gangs , knowing that such groups often give troubled youth a way to make money while providing a sense of family and social support			1
eventually , she came up with the idea for the @entity43 , a 1940s - style restaurant run entirely by young people from difficult circumstances			1
the bistro is in one of @entity0 's roughest neighborhoods , but inside , the atmosphere is warm and inviting			1
customers come from all over the city to enjoy the food and entertainment and to support @entity56 ' mission , which provides jobs , career training and a built - in support system to at least 25 at - risk people each year			1
@entity4 estimates that 75 % of those who 've worked at the restaurant have been incarcerated or in trouble with the law			1
@entity65 was first incarcerated at 14 , and he floated in and out of @entity3 's juvenile justice system for years			1
with his criminal record , he did n't see many options for himself			0
" i thought , ' no one is going to hire me ; what else can i do ? ' " said @entity65 , now 19			0
a year ago , his probation officer told him about the restaurant			1
now , three nights a week , @entity65 works as a server and has become a valued member of the @entity43 team			1
young people like @entity65 fill all of the positions in the restaurant			2
with the help of a couple of adult mentors , they stock the kitchen , prepare the food , serve the meals and manage the staff			0
they also play a large part in creating their menu of " international soul food , " which now contains several of their family recipes			0
@entity4 , a @entity94 , also offers to share her religious faith with any program participant who is interested , but she says that her program is completely inclusive and welcomes everyone , regardless of their beliefs			1
the restaurant 's theme is inspired by @entity104 in the late 1920s through the ' 40s , and the staff is decked out in red - and - black uniforms from the time period			1
@entity4 loves the music and spirit of that era and knew it would be a cool , unique vibe that would help attract customers , but she also had another motive			1
" from the @entity115 to ... jazz and swing , so much of that was started by african - americans , " she said			2
" so many of our youth are of minority descent , i feel like that connection to that era is really important			2
" @entity65 says he likes his uniform and red fedora			0
" people , when they come in , they say , ' you look good ! ' " he said			0
" they 're not used to seeing kids who 've been in trouble look like that			0
they see us in a different way			0
" giving young people a chance to be seen differently -- and to see themselves differently -- is what the program is all about			0
it 's open to at - risk youth ages 16 to 22 , many of whom are referred by social workers or probation officers			1
the applicants must submit letters of recommendation and a personal essay and go through two rounds of interviews with the program 's youth leaders			2
once accepted , they begin a four - month training course			1
during weekly sessions , employees teach the trainees the basics of every position in the restaurant			2
then the new recruits test their skills by shadowing veteran staffers during their shift			0
" some days , you 'll be the house manager			0
other days , you 'll bus tables or be the head chef , " @entity4 said			1
do you know a hero ? nominations are open for 2013 @entity171 trainees , like @entity43 staff members , attend workshops on financial literacy , @entity174 © writing and interview skills			1
they also meet regularly with a life coach who helps them set goals and connects them with resources for housing or medical care			0
participants who have n't graduated from high school must be pursuing a diploma or working on a ged			0
the program is very strict : more than one unexcused absence from work is enough to be dismissed			0
trainees receive periodic stipends , and if they complete the training , they can apply for a job			2
employees earn minimum wage -- $ 10.55 an hour in @entity0 -- and tips are shared by the entire staff			1
they are also encouraged to take on more responsibility and help supervise the newer members			0
ultimately , the youth leaders decide whom to hire and fire			2
" the whole structure of this organization is meant for the youth to keep rising up in leadership and management , " @entity4 said			1
" i 'm a big believer in ownership			0
... the more decision - making opportunities they have , the more life - changing it is			2
" @entity216 , 22 , was withdrawn and quiet as a result of the domestic violence she witnessed while she was growing up			0
she has been involved with @entity56 ' program for five years , and today she 's the youth manager of the restaurant , handling the scheduling , training and service in the " front of the house			1
" she also performs spoken - word poetry at the restaurant and recently started singing with the band			1
" now , i own my own car , i have a full - time job , and i 'm currently applying to be a homeowner , " she said			2
" i 'm so stoked about my future			0
" she credits @entity4 with helping make it all possible			1
" ( @entity4 ) pushes you past your comfort zone and past whatever limits you give yourself , " she said			1
" she 's great at encouraging us to just dream big			0
she obviously did it herself			0
this ( restaurant ) was a big dream when it started off ... and she made it happen			2
" for @entity65 , the program has been the break he needed to stay on the right path			0
" i 've been staying out of trouble , " he said			0
" now , i have a support system			2
... i feel like we 're all like family trying to help each other			0
" he 's hoping that @entity43 's scholarship fund will help him attend technical school , where he wants to create and patent his own inventions			1
stories like this are what motivate @entity4			1
she wants to establish other @entity254 across the country , and she hopes that some of the young people she 's working with now will help her			0
" i think there 's something about a light going on when you realize your potential , " she said			1
" the core of it is giving them hope			0
... once that light goes on , whatever they do , they 're on their way to fly			0
