-- in a cold , wet field two hours ' drive west of @entity3 , there 's no mistaking the huddle of ancient shapes that emerge suddenly on the horizon , back - dropped by a distant cluster of leafless trees			2
until recently , any first encounter with @entity11 , that legendary keeper of @entity14 secrets , could prove deeply underwhelming			1
two traffic - snarled highways have encroached on the brooding rocks , robbing them of their scale			2
the site 's custodians have unveiled a $ 44 million visitor center and a radical remodeling of the landscape that will reconnect the circle with the atmospheric terrain it has occupied for more than 4,000 years			1
@entity0 was among the first visitors through its doors -- and to experience a redesigned approach to the @entity31 that its guardians hope will restore some of its once - formidable presence			2
visitors are no longer directed to a cramped parking lot slapped hastily on top of historically significant earthworks			0
the parking lot and a roadway , which for decades has severed the stone circle from an ancient avenue , are being torn up and grassed over			2
instead they arrive at the new center , an elegant modern pavilion of glass and weathered sweet chestnut wood that now forms the gateway to the enigmatic millennium - old monument -- helping to create a sense of anticipation and drama			1
contrast vital " one key thing has been to make it as different from the stones as possible , " @entity54 , one of the center 's architects , told @entity0			2
the building 's undulating roof and matchstick steel pillars blend in with the area 's rolling hills and sparse woodland , he said			0
the center officially opens on december 18 , three days before the winter solstice , when druids , pagans and revelers gather to watch the sun rise in perfect alignment with the stones -- a celestial event that both explains their purpose and deepens their mystery			1
these time - honored traditions show how cherished @entity11 is , not only to the people who assign it spiritual importance , but also to the archaeologists who study its origins			1
not to mention the 1 million tourists who traipse here each year			1
it 's no wonder the government bodies guarding the site have been cautious about remodeling -- enduring 30 years of wrangling over budgets , designs and locations before creating the new center			2
worthwhile wait for some , however , the wait has been worth it			0
" i think it 's fabulous , " @entity95 , a professor of history at @entity97 , told @entity0 at the center 's opening			2
" it 's one of the most important archaeological monuments in western @entity104 and has been for so long woefully neglected			0
" in one way the delays had been an advantage , he said			0
" if it was here 10 years ago , it would look out of date because we now have completely new interpretations of how and why and when @entity11 was built			1
" @entity11 is n't visible from the center , lying over the crest of a hill -- so visitors spend time exploring its new exhibition space before walking or catching a road train to cover the mile and a half to the stone circle			1
the exhibition 's centerpiece is a 360 - degree virtual display that tries to simulate the experience of standing within the stone circle -- something most visitors have been banned from doing since the late 1970s in order to protect the rocks			0
it uses laser - scanned images to zap the viewer back through history amid dramatic solstice sunrises and sunsets			1
for anyone who has waited in vain for a dawn obscured by the miserable @entity141 weather , this could actually be an improvement			0
@entity14 head reconstructed among 250 other antiquities , the exhibition also includes the reconstructed head of a 5,500 - year - old @entity14 man found nearby			1
archaeologists have used advanced 3d scanning technology on his skull to reveal his face			0
while this undoubtedly offers a valuable glimpse into the human story behind @entity11 , there 's no escaping the fact that the result of all that hi - tech labor bears an uncanny resemblance to @entity160 in " @entity161			1
" the @entity14 man 's skeleton is also on display , a fact that has stirred some controversy			1
the leader of @entity141 's self - proclaimed largest order of druids says the use of the bones is disrespectful to their long - dead owner			1
" those who 've been laid to rest should stay at rest -- it 's not a pagan issue , it 's one of common decency , " @entity174 , who describes himself as the @entity175 of the @entity176 , told @entity0			0
while it brings visitors face to face with the monument 's history , what the new center can not do is shed definitive light on how and why @entity11 was constructed using stones quarried 150 miles away in the @entity191 mountains of @entity192			1
there have been numerous theories about their construction and purpose , ranging from outlandish claims about ufos or mythical stories of giants and wizards to explanations concerning druidic rituals or astronomical observatories			0
solstice ceremonies the 2009 announcement that another stone circle -- @entity208 -- had been discovered adjacent by the nearby @entity209 has lent support to another theory : that @entity11 was a temple forming part of a larger funeral and burial complex that only later became a place for solstice ceremonies			1
back in the 21st century , with much of the remodeling yet to be completed , it 's still a work in progress			0
although the road train 's slower approach to the stones does help build the atmosphere , the old parking lot and the remaining busy highway still blot the landscape			0
there are times , however , walking the circuit around @entity11 , when the traffic , the noise and the fellow visitors taking @entity233 selfies suddenly melt away			1
in these fleeting moments there 's a sense of the power these simple rocks have conveyed to so many			0
but while the site 's guardians hope their innovations will help visitors to connect better to the surrounding ancient landscape , for some there will always be one crucial element missing			0
" the only thing that struck me is you ca n't go up and touch it , " said fourth - time visitor @entity247 , of @entity248 , @entity249			1
" i think that 's a real shame			0
@entity255 might own it , but it really belongs to the people			0
you should be allowed to go up and hug the stones			0
" @entity11 , near @entity259 , @entity249			2
visits over the festive period wo n't require booking but must be reserved from february 1 , 2014 , when entrance will be managed through timed tickets ; adults $ 24 , child $ 14.50 , family $ 65 .			0

*overhaul* of 4,000 - year - old monument cost $ 44 million and was delayed for decades
visitor center opens days before druids and pagans descend for winter solstice
reconstructed @entity14 head looks , to at least one observer , *weirdly* like " @entity161 " film star
was it @entity280 ? origins of @entity11 remain a mystery
