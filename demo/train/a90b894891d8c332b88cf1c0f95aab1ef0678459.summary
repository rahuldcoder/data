-- a @entity2 pilot is n't happy with his employer after being stuck on the tarmac of a @entity6 airport for some eight hours on saturday			1
neither are many of his passengers			2
flights from @entity10 , @entity11 , to @entity12 , @entity13 , are usually uneventful -- two - plus hours of flight and then taxi to the gate -- but throw in a freak october snowstorm and it 's a different story			1
@entity20 504 departed @entity10 at 10:07 a.m. et saturday -- 32 minutes late			2
the flight made it to @entity12 -- just not to the runway , thanks to the weather and was diverted to @entity25 near @entity26 , @entity6			1
it landed at 1:07 p.m. what came next was an eight - hour ordeal for passengers -- and crew -- as the plane sat stuck on the tarmac with little food or water			1
" i got a problem here on the airplane			0
i 'm going to need to have the cops onboard , " a flight crew member told the tower in a conversation posted on liveatc.net , a website that monitors air traffic control conversations			1
" i need some air stairs brought over here and the cops brought onboard the airplane			2
" passenger @entity50 explained the situation in a phone interview with @entity0 affiliate @entity54 from the plane			2
" a couple passengers are fighting and there 's a baby on here that 's been crying the whole time , " she said			1
" we can not go to the bathrooms anymore			0
there 's no running water , " said @entity63 , another passenger			0
" they tell us that we 're going to be going in soon , going in soon , going in soon -- and it just never happens			0
" adding to the frustration and tension were passengers with medical conditions			1
" i have a paraplegic that needs to come off , " the pilot said			2
" i have a diabetic here that 's got an issue ... i 've just got to get some help			0
" but the plane was still not at a gate , further frustrating the pilot			2
" look , you know , we ca n't seem to get any help from our own company , " the pilot told the tower			1
" i apologize for this , but if there is any way you can get a tug and a tow bar out here to us and get us towed somewhere to a gate or something			0
i do n't care , take us anywhere			0
" the pilot , though frustrated , offered thanks to @entity25 officials			0
" listen , i just want to put in my two cents worth in for whatever it worth			0
thank you very much , " he said			0
" it 's capt. @entity104 over here on ( flight ) 504 ... i think we 've got more help from you guys than our own people			0
" the passengers broke into applause when the door finally opened , saying " let us out ! let us out ! let us out ! " @entity2 apologized for the situation and blamed it on a " confluence of events , " including intermittent power outages that complicated matters			1
" we worked with the airport to secure services , but our flights were six of the 23 reported diversions into @entity26 , including international flights ( picture big jets carrying hundreds of people ) , the airline said on its website			1
" getting all the flights deplaned at the same time in a small airport is not unlike trying to get an elephant into a smart car ; it 's not an easy fit			0
" passengers deplaned around 9 p.m. , according to @entity2 .			1
