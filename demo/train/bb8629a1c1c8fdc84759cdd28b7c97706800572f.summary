@entity1 gov. @entity0 announced plans wednesday to file an anti-trust lawsuit against the @entity4 over its sanctions against @entity6 following the @entity8 child sex abuse scandal			1
last july , the @entity4 levied unprecedented sanctions against the university , including a fine of $ 60 million			1
it also stripped 14 seasons of football victories from late head coach @entity14			0
" these sanctions did not punish @entity8 , " or those who allegedly helped cover up his repeated sexual abuse of disadvantaged children , said @entity0 at a news conference in @entity21			2
he said they instead affect past and current students who were not part of the scandal			0
" i can not and will not let it happen without a fight , " said @entity0 , adding that the @entity8 case was a criminal matter and not a violation of @entity4 rules			1
@entity0 also called a university - funded review of the scandal led by former fbi director @entity35 an incomplete report			2
@entity35 's 267 - page review was released in july and blamed former university president @entity38 , @entity14 , suspended athletic director @entity39 and @entity41 president @entity40 for allegedly taking part in a cover - up to avoid bad publicity			0
do sanctions alter history books on @entity6 ? the scandal led to @entity38 's ouster and shocked the nation after @entity35 's team concluded that the school 's top administrators had " empowered " @entity8 , the former defensive coordinator for the football team , to continue his abuse			1
the @entity4 said in a statement wednesday it was disappointed by the governor 's action			1
" not only does this forthcoming lawsuit appear to be without merit , it is an affront to all of the victims in this tragedy -- lives that were destroyed by the criminal actions of @entity8 , " said @entity58 , @entity4 executive vice president and general counsel			1
" while the innocence that was stolen can never be restored , @entity6 has accepted the consequences for its role and the role of its employees and is moving forward			2
today 's announcement by the governor is a setback to the university 's efforts			0
" @entity6 also issued a statement wednesday saying it remained " committed to full compliance with the @entity79 , the @entity80 and , as appropriate , the implementation of the @entity35 report recommendations			2
" school faced 4 - year ' death penalty ' the fine is expected to be paid over five years and will fund an endowment with a mission of fighting child sex abuse and supporting victims			0
@entity1 's @entity91 delegation objects to the @entity4 's plans to spend only 25 % of those funds within the state			1
the delegation wants the association to spend all of the $ 60 million in @entity1 , according to a november letter to the @entity4			1
" while we fully support the stated purpose of the endowment , we believe its funds should be used solely for programs and organizations within the @entity1 , where a need exists for the creation of prevention programs for sexually abused children , " the letter stated			0
@entity8 , 68 , was convicted last june on 45 counts of child sex abuse , ranging from corruption of minors to involuntary deviate sexual intercourse , which were laid out in graphic testimony by his accusers over the course of the less - than - two - week trial			0
in october , he was sentenced to 30 to 60 years in prison , meaning he 'll likely die behind bars			0
@entity6 alum : we deserved @entity4 penalty @entity6 , a college football powerhouse and two - time national champion , avoided the @entity4 's " death penalty , " a suspension from play of a year or more , in the @entity8 abuse case			1
but @entity127 , the chairman of the @entity4 's executive committee , said the sanctions on the school " should serve as a stark wake - up call to everyone in college sports			1
" @entity6 president @entity134 said the university accepted the decision and would not appeal			0
" i think , for the whole university , what this calls upon us to do is to look at our whole value culture , our whole value set , our value base , " @entity134 told @entity137 last year			0
@entity14 , who coached at @entity6 for 46 years , was fired after @entity8 's arrest in november 2011			2
he had been the all - time leader in major college football victories for a coach , with 409 wins			0
the @entity4 's decision strikes 111 of those from his record , beginning in 1998 -- a move that posthumously bumps him from the top of the list			2
last july , the @entity156 declared @entity6 ineligible for any conference title football games and ruled that the @entity159 ' share of bowl revenues for four seasons -- about $ 13 million -- will be donated to charities that " protect children			1
" @entity164 , a @entity6 spokesman , said last year the school will not use tax or tuition dollars to pay the @entity4 's $ 60 million fine			1
