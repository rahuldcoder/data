it 's not your usual selfie			1
" the sensation is happening again , " @entity3 tells the camera			0
" it 's all tingling on left side			1
" " i do n't know why this is happening to me			1
" the @entity11 - area woman was having her third stroke in three days			1
and this time , she refused to suffer in private			2
@entity3 recorded a selfie video of her symptoms after pulling over while driving			1
the next day , the video would help doctors at @entity18 correctly diagnose her with transient ischemic attacks , or " mini-strokes , " due to plaque buildup in her arteries			2
now , according to @entity3 , she is on cholesterol - lowering medication and blood thinners , and has n't had any more strokes			1
the video may have saved her life			2
no two strokes are alike : my story two days before the recording , doctors at a local emergency room in @entity11 dismissed her face numbness and slurred speech as stress - related			1
they told her stroke tests had come back negative and counseled the 49 - year - old legal secretary on breathing techniques			1
those were ineffective , and @entity3 suffered two additional mini-strokes in consecutive days -- the first leaving the hospital parking lot on april 1			0
she knew something had to be done			0
" i think it was just to show somebody , because i knew it was not stress - related , " she said in an interview with the @entity46 " and i thought if i could show somebody what was happening , they would have a better understanding			2
" that was exactly what happened			0
@entity3 filmed the third " mini-stroke " the next day en route to work			0
after arriving , she showed the video to co-workers , who immediately suggested she go to a different hospital			2
still , dr. @entity62 with the @entity63 said he believes @entity3 was lucky			0
his advice : " do n't waste time on a video , just call 911			1
" he said , " it 's the same thing for everyone			2
if you 're having a stroke , think you 're having a stroke or see someone having one -- just call 911			1
" @entity62 and his organization are working on an upcoming campaign targeting women and their likelihood for strokes			0
according to the @entity80 , 55,000 women have strokes each year			0
as in @entity3 ' case , the @entity82 said signs of stroke generally include sudden numbness , confusion and difficulty walking			0
the @entity89 uses the acronym @entity91 -- meaning face dropping , arm weakness and speech difficulty are all signs that it 's time to call 911			1
usually , paramedics , emergency responders and doctors correctly identify the situation and will get individuals the help they need			0
" it 's hard to say why there was an incorrect diagnosis ( initially ) , but things like that can happen , " @entity62 said			1
" still , the quicker you are to the hospital , the higher the likelihood of a good outcome			0
