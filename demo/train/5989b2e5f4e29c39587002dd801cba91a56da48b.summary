-- unlike @entity4 , the @entity3 @entity2 organization has shown little appetite for taking its brand of jihadism beyond the borders of @entity3 and @entity9			1
certainly that 's the case if the messages from the organization 's leader , @entity13 , are to be taken at face value			2
" from now on , " he says in an audio message said to have been recorded in april , " the main targets of our fedayeen [ fighters ] are @entity23 cities			2
this good news will be heard within some days or weeks			2
today onwards , the direction of our jihad is @entity23 states and cities			0
@entity29 we are successful in this mission and objective			0
" the @entity3 @entity2 , also known as @entity32 , or @entity32 , does not lack a motive to lash out			1
in recent months it has come under increasing pressure as the @entity23 has intensified drone strikes and the @entity3 army has carried out offensives against the group deep inside its safe haven in @entity3 's @entity41			1
officials are keeping an open mind about any link between the @entity2 and the failed car bombing in @entity46 last weekend			1
within hours of the incident , an audio message purportedly from @entity48 ( a senior member of the @entity32 ) claimed responsibility for the attack			0
" this attack is a revenge for the great and valuable martyred leaders of mujahedeen , " he said			0
at first intelligence analysts discounted the message ( not least because of specious claims by the group in the past ) , but as more information emerged about the incident , it has received renewed attention			0
very occasionally in the past the @entity32 has made threats about launching attacks overseas			1
before he was killed by a drone strike last year , the group 's then leader , @entity68 ( no direct relation to @entity13 or @entity48 ) told reporters : " very soon we will take revenge from @entity74 , not in @entity9 but in @entity75 ­ ing ­ ton , which will amaze the entire world			0
" and he added : " the max ­ i ­ mum they can do is mar ­ tyr me			0
" they did -- but not before @entity13 made an outlandish claim that the @entity32 was responsible for a shooting rampage in @entity84 , @entity46 , that left 13 people dead			1
( a @entity87 immigrant carried out the attack before killing himself			0
) the question for counterterrorism officials now is whether the threat by @entity13 to attack targets in the @entity23 is bluster or carries real menace			2
the @entity32 was officially formed in 2007 when a number of hard - line @entity97 groups demanding the introduction of @entity100 law in @entity3 came together in the @entity41			1
they had already murdered scores of tribal elders to clear the area of rival authorities			0
the @entity32 's ambitions were at first confined to the tribal territories bordering @entity9			2
but by 2009 it was challenging @entity3 's heartlands and its establishment , with attacks on police academies , government buildings and army convoys as far away as @entity114 and @entity115			1
it has also cooperated closely with the @entity9 @entity2 and attacked @entity118 convoys and pre-positioned supplies on their way to @entity9			1
but it was the @entity2 's widening campaign against the state that led the @entity3 army to launch major offensives last year in the @entity125 and @entity126			1
there has been just one documented example of the @entity32 showing more global ambitions			1
on january 19 , 2008 , 12 @entity3 and two @entity130 were arrested in @entity131 , @entity132			1
ten were charged -- along with another suspect later detained in the @entity134 -- with involvement in a conspiracy to carry out suicide bomb attacks on @entity131 's subway system			2
several of the conspirators had arrived from @entity3 in the weeks before they were arrested			1
soon after their arrest , @entity23 defense secretary @entity140 said : " the @entity131 cell appears to have ties to a terrorist training network run by @entity68			0
" several months later a @entity32 spokesman , @entity146 , acknowledged in a video , " the one in @entity131 was conducted by 12 of our men			0
they were under pledge to @entity68 , and @entity32 has already claimed responsibility because of @entity132 's military presence in @entity9			0
" the 11 ultimately charged were convicted and sentenced to jail terms of eight to 10 years in december last year			0
much of the prosecution 's case was based on an informant inside the cell who said he had been trained in the use of explosives in @entity126 , the @entity32 's stronghold before the @entity3 army offensive			1
to date , the @entity131 case remains the only credible example of the @entity32 's capability to take its fight overseas			2
but other @entity3 groups have shown an ability and desire to broaden their targets			1
@entity172 recruited @entity23 @entity173 to reconnoiter and plan an attack on the offices of the @entity177 newspaper that published cartoons of the @entity179 in 2005			0
he was arrested on his return to the @entity23 last year -- before any attack was carried out -- and pleaded guilty to charges connected to the conspiracy			0
@entity173 also confessed to involvement in reconnaissance for the @entity187 attacks by @entity172 in november 2008			2
for its part , the @entity32 has developed both its alliances and capabilities closer to home , most notably joining forces with @entity4 for the attack on a @entity23 base in eastern @entity9 that killed seven @entity197 employees and contractors last december			0
and last month it launched a complex but unsuccessful attack on the @entity23 @entity201 in @entity202			0
intelligence analysts believe that as the attempted car bombing in @entity206 was so poorly executed , it would be surprising if the @entity32 were closely involved .			1

officials keep open mind about any link between @entity2 and failed @entity46 car bombing
@entity3 @entity2 occasionally has made threats about launching attacks overseas
