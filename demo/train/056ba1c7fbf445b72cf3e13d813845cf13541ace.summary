-- 1980s nostalgia is about to intensify			1
this week , @entity3 television will premiere its new show " @entity5 , " a sitcom about a suburban middle - class family in the 1980s that loves to yell and scream			1
the pilot promises to bring back memories of colorful leg warmers , @entity11 , @entity13 stores , and @entity15 electronic game units			2
" before there were parenting blogs , trophies for showing up , and peanut allergies , " the network 's online description says , " there was a simpler time called the ' 80s			2
" while the program will showcase the lighter side of @entity28 culture in the 1980s , we should remember the decade was anything but simple when it came to politics			1
there were huge changes that took place in this pivotal decade that continue to shape politics today			1
tax cuts and deregulation : the roots of our current economic policies lie in the 1980s			1
with @entity42 in the @entity43 , republicans were able to have a huge impact on taxation and regulation			2
one of @entity42 's signature changes was the tax reduction of 1981 , which significantly lowered income tax rates and weakened the ability of the federal government to raise revenue			1
while there have been tax increases since that time , the trajectory of the overall rate structure has generally moved downward , making it extremely difficult for the government to finance new programs without raising the deficit			1
the @entity42 administration was also very successful at promoting economic deregulation			0
the idea of deregulation had already gained bipartisan support in the 1970s			0
democrats like sen. @entity66 pushed for the deregulation of the airline industry to help consumers , while conservative economists like @entity71 championed deregulation to free up markets			0
but @entity42 sold the idea like no other politician before him			0
he believed that markets were superior to government at almost every turn			0
his aggressive push for deregulation of markets would continue to influence debate in the 1990s as @entity65 joined the @entity83 in dismantling @entity85 programs that had monitored financial markets			0
the nation paid the price with the devastating financial collapse of 2008			0
life and politics in the 1980s the end of the @entity93 : the end of the @entity93 started in the middle of the 1980s			1
while young americans such as @entity96 -- the middle child in the television show and the family upon which it is based -- were mostly worried about what cassette tapes they should buy and getting their first car , @entity42 entered into a series of historic negotiations with @entity106 president @entity105 between 1985 and 1987 that culminated with the signing of the @entity109 in 1987			1
following the treaty , the @entity106 would collapse in the years when @entity111 was in the @entity43			0
since the 1980s @entity28 foreign policy has been characterized by a shifting and murky battle against rogue states and terrorist networks			1
the battle lines have never offered voters or politicians the same kind of clarity as existed in the @entity93 , often making it more difficult to mobilize long - term support behind military operations and producing confusion about what policymakers are even trying to achieve			1
this was true even after 9/11 as the @entity28 became bogged down in a war in @entity130 that had little to do with the source of the attack			0
liberalization of social and cultural values : even with @entity42 and @entity111 in the @entity43 , @entity28 culture continued to embrace the values from the @entity137			0
during this decade , @entity28 were listening to more explicit lyrics in their music , watching television shows and movies that had more sexuality and violence , and listening to radio shows such as @entity145 's which abandoned the social inhibitions of the 1940s and 1950s , when the original " @entity5 " aired on radio and television			0
beyond entertainment , public health crises -- most importantly the spread of the deadly @entity154 virus -- required policymakers to have more honest talks with the public about sexual relations			0
in 1987 , hundreds of thousands of activists marched on @entity161 to call on the federal government to devote more resources to combating @entity154			0
as homosexuality became less of a taboo , more gay @entity28 came out of the closet			0
there were also celebrities who made a difference			0
in 1985 , the publicist of the actor @entity171 , a very close friend of the president , announced that @entity171 had @entity154			0
although his people said it had resulted from a blood transfusion , the media soon reported that @entity171 had been gay			1
@entity28 were also living in a country that was becoming even more ethnically and culturally diverse , as the waves of immigration that had swept into the nation since the immigration reform of 1965 remade the cities and suburbs			0
@entity28 became familiar with the world that @entity184 , @entity185 and other immigrants were building			2
in recent years , @entity28 have been giving their strong support to gay rights and rejecting those who warn that recent developments , such as same - sex marriage , are pushing the nation in the wrong direction			2
there is also very little support for efforts to impose regulations on popular culture , and much more comfort that there is no danger in @entity28 ' having more honest discussions and cultural exposure to sexuality			0
while some conservatives adhere to hard - line positions on immigration restriction , national polls show that most @entity28 support a path to citizenship			1
the 24 - hour news media : in 1980 , @entity0 began , and the erosion of the era of network news dominance was under way			1
the network news established in the 1960s had revolved around three nightly news shows , each approximately a half - hour in length			1
@entity0 broke the mold when it began the 24 - hour news cycle from its @entity223 studios			1
with @entity0 , the flow of information was constant and it was much harder for politicians to respond to the emergence of stories			0
other cable news networks soon emerged , including @entity230 , @entity231 and @entity232 , as cable became a dominant mode of information			2
the @entity236 followed this same model , making the news cycle even more intense			2
this media cycle had a number of effects			2
it fragmented and decentralized the distribution of news information , making it more difficult for politicians , including the president , to reach broad national audiences , since viewers could tune in to a much wider variety of stations			2
once the @entity253 , which had required stations to give opposing viewpoints equal airtime , came to an end in 1987 , the cable networks could air more partisan newscasts			0
the proliferation of channels and the 24 - hour cycle intensified the competition among news outlets to release information as fast as possible and to find stories about political scandal and conflict that would attract viewers			1
this fueled the partisan polarization that was taking place in @entity161 during this decade			0
as viewers watch the antics of the @entity5 , remembering or learning about what life was like in long - ago suburbia , it 's worth thinking about the bigger changes that were taking place outside the home that have continued to shape our politics			2
the 1980s are much more than nostalgia			1
we live in the fast - changing world of the 21st century , yet ours is a society that owes much to the way things were three decades ago			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity291 .			1

@entity291 : from tax cuts to the 24 - hour news media , the 1980s were *tremendously* influential
