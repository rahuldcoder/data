-- the @entity3 @entity2 investigating drinking water contamination in @entity5 , @entity6 , found benzene and methane in wells and in groundwater , agency officials said			1
at a community meeting with well owners , @entity2 officials revealed tuesday they found low levels of petroleum compounds in 17 of 19 drinking water wells sampled , and that nearby shallow groundwater was contaminated with high levels of petroleum compounds such as benzene , according to the report			1
the affected well owners were advised not to drink the water at the recommendation of the @entity3 @entity25 ' @entity26 , and told to use alternate sources of water for drinking and cooking , agency officials said			1
meanwhile , the @entity2 is working with various government partners and @entity33 , a natural gas company , to provide affected residents with water and to address potential sources of the contamination , agency officials said			1
the study included sampling 21 domestic wells within the area of concern , two municipal wells , plus sediment and water from a nearby creek			0
the @entity2 also sampled groundwater and soil from pit remediation sites , and produced water and condensate from five production wells operated by the primary natural gas operator in the area , agency officials said			2
no health concerns were found related to inhalation exposure to chemicals while showering or using evaporative coolers , agency officials said			0
the @entity2 has not reached any conclusions about the sources of chemical compounds found in drinking water wells , including hydraulic fracturing , or " fracking , " the controversial process used to extract natural gas from underground , agency officials said			1
officials are uncertain if the contaminated shallow groundwater will migrate to the drinking water aquifer , according to the report			0
" @entity2 will work as long as necessary to ensure that @entity5 residents have safe water , " @entity74 , @entity2 's regional administrator in @entity75 , said in a statement released tuesday			2

the agency sampled 39 individual wells ( 37 residential wells and two municipal wells ) in march 2009 and found nitrate , arsenic and methane gas			0
the agency conducted the second sampling in january 2010			0
over the past week , officials from @entity2 and the federal agency for toxic substances met privately with individual residents to provide health information and recommendations based on well - specific sampling results , agency officials said .			2
