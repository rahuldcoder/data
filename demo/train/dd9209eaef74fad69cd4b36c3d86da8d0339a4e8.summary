@entity0 and the @entity1 rang in the @entity2 new year tuesday with distinctly different messages for the @entity0 people			1
president @entity5 slammed the @entity7 's crackdown on electronic communications and ayatollah @entity9 warned that @entity0 would not hesitate to strike back in the event of an attack on the @entity13 republic			1
the beginning of the year 1391 took @entity9 to the massive @entity16 shrine complex in the eastern city of @entity18 , where thousands jammed the mosque to hear the nation 's supreme leader			2
@entity9 denied @entity0 has nuclear capability or that it is trying to develop atomic weapons			1
but he warned that @entity0 will defend itself if the @entity1 or @entity26 attacks -- words that only increase anxiety in @entity0 's nuclear showdown with world powers			1
sporadic chants of " @entity32 " erupted during @entity9 's pauses in between his declarations of @entity0 's greatness and the @entity37 's inability to tear down the @entity13 revolution 's achievements			1
@entity9 said the main reason for the @entity37 's enmity toward @entity0 has to do with its desire to control @entity0 's vast oil reserves			1
" a nation 's prowess all depends on energy , on oil , " he said			2
" it 's the @entity7 of @entity0 that they have a problem with because this republic has stood like a lion in their face			2
" @entity9 also urged @entity0 to support domestic production to stave off the debilitating effects of international sanctions			1
he said the government must cooperate with local industries and financial institutions to boost production			0
he urged @entity0 to buy local -- saying that @entity0 - made products are just as good as foreign brands			2
" you must seek @entity0 - made products , " he said			2
" it 's in your hands , the hands of the people			0
when you consume , consume indigenously			0
" @entity5 , on the other hand , used the holiday , known as @entity72 , to remind the world of the @entity76 regime 's attempts to curb the flow of information in and out of @entity0			1
" like the iron curtain of the 20th century , an electronic curtain is descending as the @entity0 regime attempts to control what its citizens see and hear , ' @entity5 said in a video new year 's message posted on @entity86 in @entity87 , with @entity2 and @entity89 subtitles			1
" to the people of @entity0 , this holiday comes at a time of continued tension between our two countries , " he said			2
" but as people gather with their families , do good deeds , and welcome a new season , we are also reminded of the common humanity that we share			0
there is no reason for the @entity1 and @entity0 to be divided from one another			2
" yet increasingly , the @entity0 people are denied the basic freedom to access the information that they want			1
the @entity0 government jams satellite signals to shut down television and radio broadcasts			0
it censors the @entity112 to control what the @entity0 people can see and say			2
the regime monitors computers and cell phones for the sole purpose of protecting its own power			0
and in recent weeks , @entity112 restrictions have become so severe that @entity0 can not communicate freely with their loved ones			0
" as a result of " the actions of the @entity0 regime , " @entity5 said , " an electronic curtain has fallen around @entity0 -- a barrier that stops the free flow of information and ideas into the country , and denies the rest of the world the benefit of interacting with the @entity0 people , who have so much to offer			1
" the @entity72 messages come at a time of heightened tensions between @entity0 and world powers			0
the @entity1 and the @entity137 have targeted @entity0 banks in an effort to persuade @entity0 to abandon any nuclear weapon ambitions			0
a nuclear watchdog agency report in november said @entity0 could potentially be developing a bomb			0
@entity26 has even hinted at pre-emptive strikes on @entity0 nuclear plants to set shut down or , at least , set back @entity0 's program			1
@entity5 and @entity26 prime minister @entity146 recently discussed the matter at the @entity148			0
@entity0 has been reeling under the crush of sanctions that have severely devalued the currency and spiked prices of food and other basic commodities			0
some @entity0 told @entity155 that their @entity72 celebrations would be sharply tempered this year because of the economic situation -- they simply could not afford it			0
@entity9 urged unity among @entity0 at this time			1
@entity159 , he said , only emboldens @entity0 's enemies			1
" i hope 1391 , which begins today , will be joyful for our nation , ' @entity9 said			0
" @entity166 almighty , defeat the enemies of this great nation			0

ayatollah @entity9 warns @entity0 will strike back if attacked
he says @entity172 nations want to control @entity0 's oil
in a video message , @entity5 says ' an electronic curtain ' is descending in @entity0
he says @entity0 are denied access to information
