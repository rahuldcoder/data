-- @entity2 coach @entity1 said he " could n't be more proud " of his players after thursday 's hard - fought 13 - 6 victory over @entity5 at the @entity6 in @entity7			1
it was the @entity9 ' first win of the tournament , after a 22 - 10 defeat to @entity1 's native @entity12 on sunday , with a superb 18th - minute try from scrumhalf @entity14 after proving to be the difference between the two sides in wet conditions in @entity18			1
the @entity5 , making their @entity6 debut , took an early 3 - 0 lead through a penalty from flyhalf @entity22 , but the @entity2 rallied despite several misses from goalkicker @entity24 and the @entity25 were left with just a solitary bonus point to show for their efforts			1
" it was a great victory for us , " former @entity12 coach @entity1 told the @entity6 's official website			2
" i thought it was a good match in these conditions			2
as a coach i could n't have asked for more			0
i could n't be more proud of these boys			0
" the @entity2 also beat @entity5 by a seven - point margin the last time they met , at the @entity37 in june , but @entity2 captain @entity38 said @entity40 's side were making impressive progress			1
" i was very nervous at the end but they are a tough , tough team , " the 28 - year - old said			0
" they are improving every time we play them and are getting better and better			0
" @entity5 's team director @entity47 was satisfied his players were able to run the @entity2 close , but the 42 - year - old former @entity50 flanker bemoaned the mistakes made by the team			1
" certain errors cost us the game , " @entity47 said			0
" we did n't use our opportunities			0
unfortunately , the lineouts did n't function but the team have come a long way to be competing right until the end of the game			0
" the @entity2 now sit third in @entity60 , level on points with @entity12 in second but having played one game more			2
@entity1 's team next play two - time world champions and current group leaders @entity67 on september 23 , but face an uphill task to notch just a fourth victory in the four - yearly tournament 's history			1
the other two were against @entity72 in 1987 and 2003			0
@entity5 's next opponents are @entity74 , who lost their opener 32 - 6 to @entity67 on tuesday , then the @entity67 and @entity12 .			1

the @entity2 beat @entity5 13 - 6 to win their first match of the @entity6
the match in @entity18 was @entity5 's first at a @entity6
a *converted* try from scrumhalf @entity14 proves the difference between the teams
the @entity2 next face @entity67 , while @entity5 take on @entity74
