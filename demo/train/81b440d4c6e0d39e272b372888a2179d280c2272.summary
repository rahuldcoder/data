-- in the age of the cell phone , in which every public space buzzes with the conversation of strangers , is it any surprise that a silent movie has captured the public imagination ? on tuesday " @entity8 , " a silent movie about the transition to sound , was nominated for 10 @entity11			1
@entity12 once said that the only problem with silent movies was that people 's mouths moved and no sound came out			2
today we face the opposite problem , inside and outside the movie theater : @entity21 comes out of people 's mouths even when it should n't			2
to get a break from overhearing the incessant , unwanted talk that surrounds us is a valuable thing , and the box office and award - season success of " @entity8 " proves it			1
the secret to " @entity8 " 's success goes beyond shutting off the surround - sound , however			1
the transition from silent cinema to the talkies , which was the greatest technological change in the movies before the digital era , came at a time of enormous economic devastation all around the world , a time very much like ours			1
the talkies were born in the late 1920s , as the stock market rose , but only triumphed during the depression , after it crashed			2
back then , movie theaters had to retool for sound amid economic uncertainty , just as they are doing today as they make the switch from film projection to digital			1
for film fans this is a melancholy change , just as the end of the silent era was for cinephiles then			0
the two great transitional films of their periods , " @entity59 " in 1927 and " @entity60 " in 2009 , are linked by more than actors in face paint			0
conceived during economic booms , both films ushered in new technologies that only fully emerged during economic crises			0
by setting " @entity8 " in the @entity69 of the late 1920s and early 1930s , during a transition that was artistic , technological , and societal all at once , the film 's director , @entity67 , connects the film to our time			1
the key to the film 's appeal is how lighthearted @entity67 keeps it			0
for him , the lost era of the silents was an innocent time , unmarred by the rape , murder , and suicide scandals other depictions of that period often exploit			0
" @entity8 , " essentially a happy film , shows us that we can accommodate change and thrive			2
@entity92 's " @entity91 , " set in 1931 , treats the same subject but reaches further back , to the birth of cinema			2
its backward glance has been rewarded with one more @entity11 nomination than " @entity8 , " although " @entity91 " has not done as well at the box office , in part because of an advertising campaign that was afraid to embrace its real values			1
@entity92 's ambitious film links the handmade , hand - painted , and hand - cranked movies the magician @entity103 made between 1896 and 1913 to the digital wizardry of films made today , 100 years later , especially to the @entity107 films			1
" @entity91 , " a beautiful and overwhelming phantasmagoria , chooses @entity108 and color over " @entity8 " 's flat - screen black - and - white			1
those choices inject the film with a layer of whimsical irony : today 's technology is contrasted with yesterday 's			0
@entity92 uses the most sophisticated digital technology available to reconnect us to a cinema that was optical and mechanical -- glass and gears ; hardware , not software			1
more and more , we put ourselves in the strange position of using technology to get away from technology			0
when we travel , smartphones connect us with places to find quiet and solitude , sometimes from within quiet cars on trains ; when we shop , we browse computer screens for hand - sewn fashions and crafts			0
when we watch tv , high - def screens show us the natural world in never - seen - before detail , taking us to places we will never visit , including , recently , thermal volcanoes on the bottom of the ocean , where undreamed of species exist , looking uncannily like the papier - mâché creatures in @entity103 ' " @entity145			2
" the world is in our face , but untouchable			0
as digital imagery takes over the movies , filmmakers and audiences seek to reconnect to an analog , hands - on world , one in which machines are understandable and fixable			1
we want to see and feel how they work			0
high tech renders all the strings , smoke , and mirrors invisible ; low tech exposes them , and by so doing presents magic as made by hand			0
we desire a less perfect world than the digitized one blockbuster movies have shown us , one where the scratches and seams are added as an aftereffect			0
" @entity8 " and " @entity91 " are both films of clocks , where time is running out or winding down or an alarm is about to go off			1
two other impressive and unpredictably popular clock - centric films made in the past year also deal in the exhumation of the past : @entity178 's " midnight in @entity177 " ( which got four @entity11 nominations ) , in which @entity182 's woody - stand - in goes back in time every night to live in the @entity177 of the 1920s ; and @entity186 's monumental " @entity185 , " an art - gallery film that was itself a timepiece , a 24 - hour - long compilation of shots from other movies that shows the hands of clocks through every minute of the day			1
recent books , like @entity195 ' " @entity194 : @entity203 's addiction to its own past , " take a despairing view of our current nostalgia , a longing that , say what you will , makes sense given the bleakness we face			0
movies like " @entity8 , " " @entity91 , " " @entity207 " and " @entity185 " present a deeper view of the past than that			1
it is one in which our future is linked to the twilight of another time , which is paradoxically the era of @entity217 's " @entity216 , " a silent film which still stands at the pinnacle of cinematic expression , and which came out a month before " @entity59 " sang away an era			0
do these movies smuggle the past into the future or just use it as pastiche ? in an era where airports feature bizarre signs reading " snow globes are not allowed through the security checkpoint , " these movies insist on the physicality of silent cinema , a memento mori in the age of the delete button			0
