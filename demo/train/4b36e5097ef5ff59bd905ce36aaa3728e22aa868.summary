-- though @entity2 sits just 150 miles south of @entity4 's capital , @entity5 , the bankrupt complex is a desolate stretch of concrete			1
in happier times , it was an expensive symbol of @entity4 's thriving economy and optimism for the future			1
now , it serves as a reminder of the country 's financial failings			1
" the construction of an airport like this , and of other places that are completely worthless ; there were a lot of them -- is responsible for the crisis , " director @entity17 told @entity18			1
@entity17 is one of several people who have since found a use for the airport , which shut down april last year			1
he shot his latest film , " i 'm so excited " , on the empty runways			1
during the day , @entity31 used the site to show off their latest model to journalists			0
" there are 4.5 kilometers of unused runway -- it 's basically the longest in @entity39 , " says @entity35 , the pr manager for @entity31			1
" when you 're on it , it 's strange , because there 's no sensation of it being a road , and you have no sense of when it will end			2
it appealed to us because it was a very different experience			0
" there is little chance that the airport will recover its investment ; it cost $ 1.3 billion to build , and though not in use , it continues to incur maintenance costs			0
" although having that kind of surface would be great for racing , how much are you going to make to justify the cost of acquiring that much land ? " asks @entity56 , the director general of @entity57			0
likely , says @entity56 , the owners are simply biding their time until they sell it , piecemeal			0
" typically , there 's not a whole lot of instances where someone comes along and buys the whole property , " says @entity56			2
" the facilities , or set of facilities , do n't lend themselves to other uses			0
" at @entity76 @entity75 , the $ 5.7 billion travel hub that has yet to open , tourists can tour the empty grounds via bus or bike			0
according to the airport 's spokesman @entity83 , its opening has been stalled because of problems with the fire protection system			2
an airport tour now , he says , gives visitors an opportunity to walk areas that , once opened , will be cordoned off			0
mainly , though , he hints it 's a chance to market the airport while it waits to open			2
situated on the fringes of one of @entity99 's most densely populated areas , the city 's @entity94 was renowned as one of the most exciting to land at			2
replaced in 1998 by @entity101 ( built on a purpose - made island to the west of the city ) the @entity94 site lay largely unused until construction began in 2009 to convert the runway into a new cruise ship terminal			0
the first ship docked at the site in june and is set to welcome more regular visitors from october			0
some former hubs have reinvented themselves for good			0
in @entity114 , @entity115 , @entity113 was converted into a park and entertainment complex			1
though one of the old hangars was turned into a school , according to @entity122 , a cultural historian for the city , the area has lost its aeronautic identity			2

the former @entity132 in @entity133 , @entity134 ( once the fifth busiest hub in the @entity136 before closing in 1994 ) is being redeveloped as a mixed - use housing community			1
the development is slated for completion in 2025 and is more than halfway done -- of 8,000 projected homes , 5,000 have already been constructed and sold			0
" the demand is more than anyone could imagine , " says @entity141 , a spokesperson for the site 's developer , @entity144 , and a former spokesman to @entity146 , the @entity133 mayor that launched the project			1
as for why @entity144 took on such a massive undertaking ( the decision to sell the $ 79.4 million site whole was @entity146 's idea ) , @entity141 maintains it was a no - brainer			2

there was a tremendous opportunity to redevelop land that was underutilized , " he says			0
converting an airport is a tremendous undertaking			0
@entity141 says @entity144 had to tear up 1,100 acres of pavement and 4.2 million square feet of aviation buildings , a process he described as " breathtaking " in its complexity			0
in @entity174 , @entity175 , real estate developer @entity172 is performing a similar feat with the site of now defunct @entity178			1
" we saw 700 acres in the center of @entity174 , and it was three miles from downtown and two miles from the university in this rising town where great things are happening			1
it was a great location , and a great opportunity , " says @entity186 , executive vice president of @entity172			0
remnants from the old airports haunt both sites ; at @entity132 , the old 12 - story control tower looms in the backdrop , while @entity194 still boats a @entity196 - era hangar			1
in spite of these details , @entity186 maintains that some residents have already forgotten the area 's original identity			2
" i tell people that i live in @entity194 , and i 'll say , ' you know , the former airport , ' and they 'll say , ' oh , that used to be an airport ? ' " editor 's note : an earlier version of this story incorrectly identified @entity2 as north of @entity5 .			1

many abandoned , or ' ghost ' airports , are finding new uses .
@entity2 was used in the backdrop of @entity17 's film , ' i 'm so excited ' .
@entity114 , @entity115 's @entity113 has been converted into park space .
old @entity136 airports in @entity133 and @entity174 have been turned into housing complexes .
