@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 's ruling junta announced wednesday a new election law that disqualifies pro-democracy leader @entity5 from participating in upcoming national elections			1
the @entity7 , announced in state - run newspapers , excludes electoral participation by any member of a political party who has been convicted in court			2
a @entity1 court convicted @entity5 , 64 , in august for breaching the terms of her house arrest after @entity18 @entity17 swam uninvited to her lakeside house in @entity0 and briefly stayed there			1
her ongoing detention was extended to november 2010 , and in february a court rejected her appeal for release			2
@entity5 's supporters have said the conviction was a way to remove her from the election campaign			1
the @entity30 laureate has spent 14 of the last 20 years under house arrest			1
the new law forces @entity5 's party , the @entity33 , to choose between honoring her as its leader and risking the party being declared illegal or ejecting @entity5 from the party and contesting the election			1
the party has 60 days to decide its course of action , but party spokesman @entity42 said wednesday that the party would not comply with the new law			0
@entity5 , the face of democracy in @entity1 , also known as @entity1 , was placed under house arrest in 1989			1
the next year , her party won more than 80 percent of the legislative seats in the first free elections in the country in nearly 30 years			0
but the military junta disqualified @entity5 from serving because of her house arrest and never recognized the election results			1
the junta has promised to hold elections -- which would be the first since 1990 -- later this year , touting them as a step toward democracy			0
no polling date has been set			0
at the @entity61 , a spokesperson for @entity60 ban ki - moon said in a statement that the organization was studying the laws			0
" the indications available so far suggest that they do not measure up to our expectations of what is needed for an inclusive political process , " the statement said			0
in @entity73 , a @entity72 spokesman said the law makes a mockery of the democratic process			0
" given the tenor of the election laws that they 've put forward , there 's no hope that this election will be credible , " @entity77 told reporters			2
" we are deeply disappointed with the political party law which excludes all of @entity1 's more than 2,000 political prisoners from political participation , " he said			1
" we are also troubled the law appears to bar @entity33 of democracy leader @entity5 from running			1
it may also prohibit her from membership in her own party			0
this is a step in the wrong direction			0
" still , he said , " we will continue our outreach and our dialogue , not because we expect it to solve this instantly			0
@entity1 has to figure out how it wants to advance			2
it 's obviously struggling to do that			0
" if @entity1 wants to build its credibility with the rest of the world , " it has to find a way to have a process where it has meaningful dialogue with ethnic groups and other political movements , " he said			2
@entity116 urged @entity1 to overturn the new law			1
" there are at least 2,200 political prisoners in @entity1 , most of whom are in prison simply because they tried to exercise their rights peacefully , " said @entity118 , @entity116 's @entity1 researcher			1
" instead of passing laws that strip away more of their rights , the @entity1 authorities should immediately release all political prisoners , including @entity5 , and remove restrictions on their political activity			1
" the new government stipulation is the latest political hurdle for @entity5			2
she was already banned from becoming president by @entity1 's recently amended constitution , which prohibits presidents and their parents , spouses and children from owing allegiance to another country			2
@entity5 was married to @entity142 academic @entity141 , who died in 1999 , and had two sons with him			0
the @entity18 considers @entity1 's military regime repressive for cracking down on political opponents , the most prominent of whom is @entity5			1
however , after years of refusing direct talks with the reclusive nation , @entity73 has recently indicated a possible re-engagement			0
@entity2 's @entity150 contributed to this report .			0
