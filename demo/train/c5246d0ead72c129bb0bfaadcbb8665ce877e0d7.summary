-- in a few breathtaking weeks , the winds of change whipped from @entity3 east to @entity4 and @entity5 , bringing down two regimes and putting the third on notice that it must make democratic changes			1
now analysts , and a world suddenly focused on the region , are wondering whether those winds will continue blowing east into @entity13 and bring real democratic change or , instead , amount to only a whisper			1
a year and a half after the @entity13 regime brutally suppressed the so - called @entity19 , a new test of its openness to reform and patience may come monday			1
the government -- which friday said the toppling of president @entity26 in @entity4 " joyfully " coincided with the anniversary of @entity13 's @entity28 -- has rounded up activists after @entity13 's two leading opposition figures called for a rally monday in support of the uprisings in @entity34 and the @entity35			1
from all appearances , the regime is not about to loosen its grip			0
and , unlike @entity26 , it wo n't be caught off - guard by the zeal of protesters			0
the @entity44 @entity43 and some observers say @entity13 may not be as confident as it appears about demonstrations			1
" they are scared , " press secretary @entity47 said friday hours after @entity26 stepped down			0
" that 's why they threatened to kill anybody that tries to do this			0
that 's why they have shut off all measure of communication			0
" @entity13 authorities on wednesday warned against any attempt by the opposition movement to hold the rally , according to the state - run @entity62			1
it was unclear whether people will take to the streets , anyway			0
" we definitely see them as enemies of the revolution and spies , and we will confront them with force , " @entity67			0
the @entity13 regime on friday celebrated the 1979 revolution that dethroned the shah			1
opposition leaders @entity78 and @entity79 asked that the rally take place in @entity83 's @entity82 , the site of mass protests by @entity13 's opposition movement after the disputed 2009 presidential elections			1
the @entity87 , based in the @entity88 , called friday for an end to restrictions on the movements of @entity78 and @entity79			0
" the [ @entity13 ] government is doing all it can to intimidate @entity13 and deny their right to peaceful assembly , " the @entity88 - based group said in a statement			1
" with recent events in @entity4 , we see another round of repression in @entity13 aimed at silencing a people frustrated and dissatisfied by the denial of their human rights			1
" observers point to an interesting synergy between protests in @entity13 and @entity4			1
they are waiting to see if what 's transpired in @entity4 will ignite a substantial renewal of protests in @entity13			1
" i think that 's a very substantial possibility , " @entity110 , a fellow at the @entity111 , told @entity0 friday			0
" i think that the @entity19 in part inspired what has happened in @entity4			2
obviously , @entity3 is the most recent inspiration			0
" " in june 2009 , when the @entity19 emerged , the internet was full of chatter by @entity4 sort of beating their breast saying , ' why are we so lame ? look at that : a million @entity13 out on the street standing up to their government			1
why ca n't we do that ? ' " " and that sort of stuck with them [ @entity4 ] , i believe , " said @entity110			2
" they kept having these small demonstrations and somehow it finally started to gather momentum and the snowball turned quickly into an avalanche			0
" " there 's no guarantee though that it will work in the reverse direction , " he said , referring to @entity13			2
the disputed 2009 presidential election sparked widespread outrage within the @entity62 republic , thrusting the depths of @entity13 society into the global spotlight and inciting violence that had n't been seen in decades			2
@entity13 quelled the demonstrations with a brutal crackdown against the peaceful street protests and the arrests of hundreds of activists , reformists and opposition figures			2
a diverse opposition movement -- headed by reform candidates @entity79 and @entity78 -- grew into today 's @entity19 , protesting for social justice , freedom and democracy			0
experts interviewed by @entity0 said they believe @entity5 , @entity156 and @entity157 will likely see significant democratic changes before @entity13 , and each face different circumstances			1
the @entity88 on friday slammed @entity13 's " hypocrisy " for arresting opposition figures and the blocking of world media outlets and websites			2
" for all of its empty talk about @entity4 , the government of @entity13 should allow the @entity13 people the same universal right to peacefully assemble , demonstrate and communicate in @entity83 that the people are exercising in @entity174 , " @entity167 spokesman @entity166 said			1
@entity13 leaders praised the @entity4 and @entity3 uprisings and said they were reminiscent of the 1979 @entity13 revolution that toppled the shah and ushered in a hard - line and theocratic @entity62 republic			1
@entity181 , director of @entity182 at @entity183 , said the @entity35 is at a " crucial tipping point			0
" if democratic voices and a government prevail in @entity4 , he told @entity0 , @entity13 will feel an uptick in internal pressure to reform			1
but , he and others said , there is a singular difference between @entity4 and @entity13			1
the @entity4 military , while key to power in the country , did not clash with its citizens			2
@entity13 's @entity197 ( @entity198 ) was established after the @entity28 to defend the regime against all threats			1
the @entity198 and its " thugs " have repressed @entity13 , @entity181 said			2
the @entity13 military is not as well equipped and as politically oriented as the @entity198 and played little , if any , part in the 2009 crackdown			2
" i think they knew the military could not be depended upon " because they might side with protesters , @entity181 said of the @entity13 government			1
the @entity198 has " expanded far beyond its original mandate , " according to the @entity212 , a @entity88 foreign policy research center			0
" today the guard has evolved into a socio - military - political - economic force with influence reaching deep into @entity13 's power structure , " the @entity212 says , noting that several current and former @entity198 members have been appointed to positions as ambassadors , mayors , undersecretaries , provincial governors and cabinet ministers			2
@entity224 , adjunct senior fellow for @entity225 at the @entity212 , said the @entity198 will stand behind president @entity226 , who helped consolidate their influence			0
and @entity230 ayatollah @entity229 has shown no signs of abandoning @entity226 , @entity224 said			0
@entity181 does n't expect the @entity13 regime to allow large protests , but he believes " major changes " and an " unstoppable democratic wind " eventually will come to the republic			1
@entity13 also must address significant economic problems , he added			2
" the @entity13 society has profoundly changed , " he said			2
" the regime has not			0
" @entity240 , a resident fellow at the conservative but non-partisan @entity241 , said he does n't expect to see major reforms in @entity13 , at least in the short term , but he believes dissidents were heartened by the @entity4 revolution			1
" the @entity19 was almost dead and it has become energized , " he told @entity0 friday			0
the reform efforts will succeed if some principal players in the regime become sympathetic , he said			0
in @entity4 , armed forces helped bring about @entity26 's downfall			2
that wo n't likely happen in @entity13 , @entity240 said			2
" revolutions take defections , " @entity240 said			0
rapid changes in @entity4 and the region make it difficult to predict what might happen in @entity13 , @entity224 said			1
" surviving the last round [ of protests ] strengthened the regime 's hand , " he said			0
the suppression " put fear in the protesters , " he said			0
to succeed , the @entity19 will have to reach out to opponents and " to the millions who are silent , " said @entity224 , a member of the faculty at @entity269			0
real change may not occur until the next presidential election , he said			0
still , the @entity13 regime is probably somewhat concerned after what happened in @entity4			1
" they are crushing anything that moves , " @entity224 said			0
@entity276 , a senior fellow for @entity88 foreign policy at the @entity212 , said one big difference between @entity13 and @entity4 are their economies			1
@entity13 has a lot of oil , and it can afford to be " more reactionary and revolutionary			0
" meanwhile , the @entity44 administration will continue to pressure @entity13 over its nuclear program , human rights and influence with militant organizations that threaten @entity288 , among other governments			0
former @entity291 gov. @entity290 on friday questioned the @entity43 's handling of @entity13			1
" media : ask " @entity296 exert as much ' constructive ' pressure on @entity13 govt to change & allow freedom -- as they just did for @entity4 ? , " she wrote on her @entity294 account			1
as the world turns its attention to @entity13 , especially in the coming days , questions remain on whether governments can change and still hold on to power			1
" the experience of the last days shows it is almost impossible to ask for democracy and not ask for a regime change , " he said			0
@entity0 's @entity310 , @entity311 , @entity312 and @entity313 contributed to this report .			0

@entity13 regime *congratulates* @entity4 revolution
but experts ask whether it will allow democratic change
@entity43 says @entity13 government *afraid* of any challenges
