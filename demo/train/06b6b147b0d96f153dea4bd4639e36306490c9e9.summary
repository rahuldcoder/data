-- @entity1 could scarcely have asked for a more enjoyable anniversary gift from his players after @entity4 produced a scintillating showing to see off @entity6 in the @entity7			1
celebrating his 17th year in charge , @entity1 watched on as the @entity9 turned in one of the @entity14 club 's finest @entity12 performances for some time to defeat the @entity16 side 2 - 0			1
@entity17 , the @entity18 playmaker who arrived on deadline day from @entity20 , was the man who ran the show			1
@entity17 's sublime opener and an @entity24 strike secured a second straight @entity7 win for @entity4 , which now sits three points clear at the top of @entity28 " considering we were playing against a top side , we played very efficiently winning the ball back and it was a very impressive first 45 minutes , " captain @entity29 told @entity30			1
" we have the talent up front to score the goals			0
but there is also a hunger			0
now we know that we need to win the ball back quickly , because when we win it back in the final third we are very dangerous			2
" we still have players to come back from injury and they will add their own qualities			0
" after its opening day defeat by @entity45 which led to huge criticism of @entity1 , @entity4 has been in imperious form			1
and the @entity48 was delighted with his side 's latest showing as it continued its winning streak			0
" i felt that we played at a good pace , technically very direct and finished with great goals , " he told @entity30			0
" the first half was outstanding			0
the second half we played more with maturity , less with drive going forward , a bit more cautious , but overall and outstanding game			0
" the first half was amazing , absolutely fantastic			0
all that you dream to see when you come to watch football			0
@entity64 and @entity29 contributed to that , and overall it was positive because i wanted @entity64 to be very good on the counter attack , especially with @entity69 , and that worked very well			0
" @entity6 coach @entity71 had never managed to win at @entity4 during his time at @entity73 or @entity74 and that statistic rarely looked like changing			1
one sided @entity4 , which sits top of the @entity78 , ran riot during a one sided first half with @entity17 dictating proceedings in the middle of the field			1
@entity6 had arrived with plenty of optimism , unbeaten this season after winning five of its opening six @entity16 games and having seen off @entity91 in its last @entity12 fixture			1
but it had little to offer in way of a response against the tidal wave of pressure exerted by a buoyant @entity4			1
in the group 's other game , @entity91 eased to a 3 - 0 win over @entity102 courtesy of @entity106 's double and a @entity104 strike			1
@entity4 hosts @entity91 in its next game on october 22 -- a tie which @entity1 is relishing following his side 's perfect start to the group stage			1
" you can not start better , and the next two will be deciders , " he added			0
" that 's when we want the game to come back after the international break and have a great game against @entity91			1
" @entity74 in @entity121 , @entity120 moved top with a 1 - 0 win at @entity124 thanks to a @entity126 strike , while @entity74 cruised to a 4 - 0 victory at @entity128			1
two goals from @entity130 , an own - goal and a late @entity133 effort clinched @entity74 's first win in this year 's competition and eased the pressure on manager @entity137			1
" this is what @entity74 needed , " @entity138 told @entity30			2
" the first game against @entity124 was a painful defeat			0
" we showed we wanted to win			2
it was enough to win			2
it will now give us confidence			0
" @entity146 has taken charge of @entity148 following a 2 - 1 win over @entity150 in @entity151			1
@entity152 and @entity153 were both on target as the @entity157 side , which won sunday 's @entity20 derby , came from behind to claim the points following @entity161 's opener			2
in the group 's other game , @entity163 's @entity162 was held to a goalless draw by @entity167 -- a result which leaves both teams with one point from their opening two fixtures			2
@entity172 @entity172 equaled @entity174 's record of 39 away wins in the @entity7 after overcoming @entity175 1 - 0			1
the @entity177 champion had chances of its own but was forced to play the final 31 minutes with 10 men following the dismissal of captain @entity182			2
@entity182 was adjudged to have kicked out at @entity183 and was given his marching orders			0
@entity185 ensured @entity172 made the most of its numerical supremacy with 15 minutes of normal time remaining			2
" i 'm not convinced it 's a red card			0
if there 's any contact it 's very minimal , " @entity175 boss @entity189 told @entity190			2
" it changed the game			0
it 's hard enough playing against @entity172 with 11 men , never mind 10 men			1
" @entity199 has a reputation in the game			0
sometimes he exaggerates things a little bit			0
" in the group 's other game , @entity204 scored a 94th - minute penalty to rescue a point for @entity209 at @entity210			1
the @entity212 side appeared to have won the contest when @entity214 netted in the 90th minute but @entity204 struck at the death to silence the home crowd after the @entity218 striker went down in the area following a tussle with substitute @entity221 .			0

@entity4 cruises to a 2 - 0 home win over @entity6 in @entity7
@entity17 scores first goal for club since move from @entity20
@entity172 edges to victory over 10 - man @entity175
@entity210 held by @entity209 , wins for @entity146 , @entity91 and @entity74
