-- facing a stopover of a few hours in @entity2 ? do n't waste it in the airport lounge			2
check in your suitcase , and zip into the city for a brief encounter with a @entity10 cultural capital set amidst idyllic natural surroundings			0
getting around @entity12 , voted the world 's seventh best in the recent @entity15 , is a mere 10 - minute train ride from the city center , with trains leaving about every 10 minutes			1
you can safely venture into the city without fear of missing your connection -- this being @entity25 , the trains run like clockwork			2
the @entity25 are among the world 's biggest users of trains , second only to the @entity31 , and insist on rail services that are reliably punctual			1

situated at the northern tip of @entity2 , with a view of the @entity42 in the distance , @entity25 's largest city has a rich history as a center of @entity10 high culture			1
with a heritage stretching back to @entity49 , it is home to grand historic buildings and more than 50 museums , meaning travelers will find plenty to occupy themselves with			0
see also : higher air fares , more mergers ? none of it comes cheaply though : @entity2 recently overtook @entity59 to become the world 's most expensive city , according to the @entity62			1
to mitigate those expenses , even those on a flying visit will likely find it worthwhile buying a @entity66 , which can be bought at the service center at the airport or the railway station			1
the card , which costs 20 chf ( $ 21.60 ) for a 24 - hour option , offers free travel on the city 's comprehensive public transport network of trains , trams , buses and boats , free admission to museums , and significant discounts on guided tours and other attractions			1
given that the return train fare from the airport to the city center is 12.80 chf ( $ 13.80 ) , and the entry to the @entity88 , the city 's modern art museum , is 15 chf ( $ 16.20 ) , even if you only have time for one activity , the card will more than likely pay for itself			1
city tours @entity97 advises taking a guided tour of the city , which can be booked through its website			0
tours of the postcard scenes of the city 's historic @entity103 , or @entity105 , take two hours and run every day , while other tours visit key sites that give an insight into the city 's history -- the rise of guilds in the 14th century , or how the city became a stronghold of the reformation			2
another option visits @entity117 , the city 's former industrial district between the @entity119 and the railway , which is now a hip , grungy home of designer retailers and eateries			0
but if you prefer to go at your pace , most of the city 's attractions are concentrated in the @entity105 , around the river and lakefront , with the rest easily accessed on @entity2 's celebrated public transport network , the world 's densest			1

climb the tower for a great view of the city			0
five minutes walk across the @entity119 is one of the city 's other major churches , the @entity158 , featuring stained glass windows by celebrated @entity161 artist @entity160			0
behind the @entity158 runs the @entity162 , a mile - long shopping street that is one of the world 's most exclusive ( and expensive )			1
if you have a few hours to spare before your flight , and feel like a bracing trip on the water , the @entity66 also allows for free travel on the boats plying @entity2			0
boat cruises on 90 - minute round trips depart from the @entity175 's depot on the waterfront at @entity177 , about five minutes walk from the @entity158			1
fast food sightseeing can work up a hunger and some of the city 's most distinctive dining experiences are to be had in the @entity105 , housed in halls that were formerly home to the guilds that wielded power in the city			0
but on a tight time frame , it might make more sense to grab something on the go			0
follow the crowds to the @entity194 -- a mobile bratwurst vendor that is a city institution			0
other @entity25 specialties include soft , baguette - like pretzels loaded with savory fillings -- available city - wide from pretzel chain @entity202 nig -- and fresh - cooked crepes smeared in apple sauce , which you can pick up from countless roadside vendors			0
sated on street snacks and sightseeing , head back to the train station and make the short ride back to the airport content in the knowledge you 've done something more stimulating during your stopover than check your email .			2
