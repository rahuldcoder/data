-- was president @entity1 dying of a rare genetic disease when an assassin killed him in 1865 ? this strip from @entity1 's deathbed pillow is housed at the @entity6 in @entity7			1
a @entity9 doctor believes so -- and he hoped to prove his theory by testing the 16th president 's dna			1
dr. @entity13 asked a small @entity7 museum for blood - stained threads from a scrap of the pillow that cradled @entity1 's head as he lay dying			1
on monday night , the board of the @entity6 and @entity20 denied his request but left the door open for a possible dna test that could shed light on @entity1 's last days			1
the museum plans to convene a forum of @entity27 scholars and forensic pathologists to decide how to proceed			1
" we want complete control over this , " said @entity29 , the board 's president			0
" we do n't want to take the chance of losing the artifact			0
" the museum did not rule out the possibility of arranging tests			0
museum board members declined to speculate on what kinds of tests could be carried out if experts conclude that such testing would not damage the scrap of pillow that is stained with @entity1 's blood			1
@entity13 is urging dna tests in the belief that those examinations would prove that the president suffered from a condition known as multiple endocrine neoplasia type @entity52 , which spurs nerve cells and bones to excessive growth			0
click here to learn more about @entity52 all patients with that condition develop thyroid cancer without treatment ; half also will get adrenal gland tumors			0
@entity13 argued that the tests could yield a new understanding of the final months of @entity1 's presidency			1
" we know how @entity1 died			1
i am more interested in how he lived , " said @entity13 , a cardiologist and author who lives in @entity69 , @entity9			0
" i would ask the historians how some knowledge of approaching death would influence the conduct of the presidency during a war , " said @entity13 , author of " @entity27 " and a consultant on the tv series " @entity78			1
" " his attitude toward the @entity80 was incredibly forgiving in the few days he had			0
" the doctor 's request stirred a debate about ethics and history			2
" this is to the @entity89 what the @entity90 is to @entity93 ' burial , " said @entity86 , a historian and museum board member			1
" it 's a sacred trust from the veterans themselves			0
they passed it on to us and trusted us to protect it			0
" the fragment that @entity13 asked to test measures about three - eighths of an inch by 5 inches			2
a group of @entity106 veterans gave the museum the relic , which was obtained from @entity1 's deathbed by someone who was there when he died			1
board members such as @entity29 opposed the doctor 's request , fearing that removing even a few strands of thread for dna testing would damage the relic			1
@entity29 also discounted the prospects of any new historical insights based on the test results			0
" why should we question whether or not he had a disease ? " he asked			0
" what 's it going to prove ? it 's not going to make the outcome of the @entity89 any different			0
" @entity29 said he is not concerned about @entity13 ' research but does worry that other @entity27 researchers could misinterpret or misuse information from a dna test			1
that 's one of the issues the board hopes the expert panel will help resolve			0
" we want to respect the memory of @entity1 , not dig in the past and make up things that are n't there , " @entity29 said			2
as evidence that the president had multiple endocrine neoplasia type @entity52 , @entity13 has cited his long limbs , bumps on his lips and problems with constipation , all classic symptoms of the rare genetic syndrome			2
but @entity13 says the key piece of evidence lies in @entity1 's family			1
" it is the @entity1 children who make me very confident , " he said			2
three of @entity1 's sons died young			2
his surviving son , @entity161 , lived to 82 and did not have bumpy lips			0
@entity13 also cites evidence that @entity1 had developed signs of cancer			1
" he did have symptoms , " the cardiologist said			0
" he had a profound change in appearance during the final year of his presidency			0
he lost a lot of weight during his presidency , and he complained of being tired all the time			0
" if @entity1 did have the rare genetic syndrome , @entity13 said , in a man of his age " cancer would inevitably exist			1
" @entity13 added , " he probably knew something was horribly wrong			0
if @entity1 was dying , certainly he recognized it because he was a smart and observant man ... but [ because of the military implications ] he would not have told a soul			2
" @entity13 is convinced that @entity1 was dying even before the assassin struck			2
after the museum board 's decision on monday night , however , he 'll have to wait to learn whether science will ever prove or refute his theory about the 16th president .			1

doctor had wanted a piece of @entity27 deathbed *pillowcase* to test dna
