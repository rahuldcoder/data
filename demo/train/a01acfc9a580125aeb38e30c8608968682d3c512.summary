@entity0 , @entity1 -- late last week , the campaigns of president @entity4 and @entity5 released web videos highlighting the mistakes their rivals have made on the campaign trail			1
@entity4 's statement that " the private sector is doing fine " was the highlight for a @entity5 video , while one of the president 's videos featured a remark by the former @entity19 governor that the nation does not need more firefighters , teachers or police officers			1
we can expect the gaffe wars to continue , since they are a staple of presidential campaigns			1
even though such statements are far from a fair indication of a candidate 's record or stance on the issues , and often they are accurate statements taken out of context , they can be devastating to a campaign			1
some off - kilter comments are too slight to sink a candidacy , but when they play into preconceptions of a candidate , the remarks -- and even sometimes a gesture or sound -- can be potent			1
@entity4 's recent statement about the private sector plays perfectly into @entity48 arguments on multiple levels			1
although @entity4 was referring to data showing that if not for cutbacks in government jobs , the recovery would be far more robust , the statement has been used to argue that the @entity55 is out of touch with average @entity57			1
it also tends to confirm the notion that @entity4 does n't really know much about the private sector , @entity48 say , in contrast to @entity5			1
finally , the statement can be used to support the criticism that @entity4 inhabits a world of celebrity , living in a bubble and unaware of the negative sentiment about his policies			2
of course , @entity4 's opponent , though a disciplined campaigner , has used a number of poorly chosen words that have contributed to his image as a tone - deaf beneficiary of privilege , such as making a $ 10,000 wager during a debate or saying at the @entity77 that he has " some great friends who are @entity79 owners			1
" his statement about public workers suggests that he does n't care about the kinds of basic services many @entity57 depend on , democrats contend			0
both men join a long history of politicians who have been criticized for a wrongly chosen phrase or gesture			1
a quick look at history shows what can happen : 1			2
@entity93 , " merely another weapon " ( 1964 ) : president @entity95 used these words , one in a series of controversial statements that the senator made about how tactical nuclear weapons could be used in certain situations , to buttress the @entity104 argument that sen. @entity93 was hell - bent on nuclear war			2
this was the basis for the famous commercial where viewers saw a little girl picking the petals of a flower , with a mushroom cloud appearing in her eye			0
@entity120 , " just had the greatest brainwashing that anybody can get when you go over to @entity119 " ( 1967 ) : @entity121 gov. @entity5 , @entity122 's father , then seen as one the most promising @entity48 in the party because of his ability to compete for moderate voters , said this upon returning from the war 's front lines			1
he was becoming more critical of the war and the lack of accurate information about it from the @entity95 administration			0
but @entity5 's comment was used by critics to question his mental stability			1
@entity138 , " @entity137 " ( 1968 ) : a song played throughout vice president @entity138 's campaign			2
the juxtaposition of the song and the scenes of anti-war protests and social turmoil , including at the @entity146 in @entity147 while the police clashed with protesters outside as the candidate spoke , served as evidence that he was out of touch with how volatile the country had become in the tumult of the 1960s			0
@entity157 , " there is no @entity160 domination of @entity161 " ( 1976 ) : when president @entity157 said these words during a televised debate with democrat @entity164 , in an effort to counteract right - wing criticism about his policy of @entity169 © tente with the @entity160 , @entity104 pounced on the statement to claim that the president was not competent on foreign policy			0
@entity173 , " i actually did vote for the $ 87 billion before i voted against it " ( 2004 ) : the statement was prime fodder for @entity48 commercials to demonstrate sen. @entity173 's flip - flopping and the inability of the @entity104 to take a tough stand on foreign policy			2
@entity182 , " the fundamentals of our economy are strong " ( 2008 ) : the statement was used by @entity104 to attack @entity48 economic policies , connecting @entity182 to the unpopular president @entity188			0
@entity189 , " no , i do n't , @entity190 , and i think you know that i 've opposed the death penalty during all of my life " ( 1988 ) : when @entity195 @entity189 said this in response to @entity2 anchor @entity199 's question about whether the @entity19 governor would support the death penalty if his wife were killed , @entity189 ' cold response suggested that he was detached and @entity104 were unwilling to take a tough stand on crime			0
@entity205 screams ( 2004 ) : after coming in third in @entity210 , @entity205 's exuberant scream in front of reporters was used by his opponents to argue that the @entity213 governor was less stable than he appeared to be			0
@entity214 checks his watch ( 1992 ) : when asked by a citizen about how the recession had affected him , the president appeared to be distracted , even checking his watch , which played directly into @entity104 criticism that he did not take domestic policy seriously			0
@entity222 sighs ( 2000 ) : vice president @entity222 's multiple sighs during a debate with @entity188 played into impressions that @entity222 was arrogant and aloof			0
though this list is far from exhaustive , the history should provide a powerful reminder to @entity4 and @entity5 that a few words can come back to haunt a campaign			1
it is virtually impossible for candidates to explain away these kinds of mistakes			0
the more they discuss them , the longer the story plays out			0
the most successful response has been by candidates who aggressively shift attention to new issues and help redirect the news cycle			0
@entity4 has made several moves that could change the conversation , including his announcement friday of a policy against deportation of many young illegal immigrants			2
in coming months , we 'll find out whether those moves are working			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity252 .			2

@entity4 , @entity5 campaigns release videos *focusing* on rivals ' flubs
@entity252 says these remarks are often taken out of context
he says a few ill - chosen phrases , or even a gesture , can help sink a candidacy
@entity252 : there 's a long history of presidential *losers* who said the wrong thing
