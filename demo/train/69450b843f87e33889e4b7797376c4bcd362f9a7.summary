-- in a spacious , sunlit apartment on the outskirts of @entity3 , @entity4 , eight roommates between the ages of 80 and 100 share a kitchen , a living room -- and 24 - hour nursing care			1
though all tenants suffer from dementia , these seniors are n't whiling away in a nursing home			1
in the open living area , complete with a flat - screen tv and photos of grandchildren on the wall , an elderly tenant draws , another arranges a flower bouquet , and a third runs a vacuum cleaner repeatedly over the same spot			1
" it will never get clean , " says @entity25 , 56 , the founder and coordinator of the shared living arrangement , stepping over the vacuum cleaner cord snaking across the hallway			2
" but it does n't matter			0
" as part of a growing trend in @entity4 , what really matters is that elderly citizens stay out of institutionalized care			1
while graying populations affect @entity39 as a whole , @entity4 has one of the highest percentages of residents aged 65 or older in the world			1
a projected 4.5 million citizens — most of them seniors — will require costly long - term care by 2050 , according to @entity48 data			1
in a recent public health insurance survey , however , about 82 % of @entity4 say they do not want to grow old in a nursing home			1
in response , as of january 2013 , a new law provides seniors with a maximum grant of € 10,000 ( $ 13,300 ) to establish a community apartment as well as a monthly subsidy of € 200 ( $ 266 ) per tenant			1
" since 2005 , the number of people requiring long - term care has been rising , but the percentage of those living in nursing homes is decreasing , " says @entity58 , a professor at the @entity59 's @entity60			1
" nursing homes are total institutions where patients lose their rights , but in alternative settings you can live in a familiar environment and your life is more meaningful			0
" while the first shared apartment for seniors appeared as a novelty in the mid- 1990s , a recent boom means that almost 2,000 senior residents live in shared housing arrangements in @entity82 alone , according to a journal of clinical nursing study			1
and as the generation that witnessed the social revolutions of the 1960s grows older , the trend is gaining momentum			1
" the image of aging is changing , " says @entity89 , a sprightly septuagenarian and former mayor of the northern @entity4 city of @entity92			1
" in the past it had to do with frailty and black clothes			0
now there is everything , from traditional people to those who want to do things differently			0
" for more than two decades , @entity89 , 74 , and his wife have been sharing a large townhouse in the center of @entity59 with seven other roommates between the ages of 17 and 79			0
while some of the tenants have changed over the years , the household now includes a couple of teachers , a retired priest , an engineer , a doctor and a student			0
" the beauty of our home is that it 's so colorful and different , " says @entity89 , author of " @entity118 is colorful , " an autobiographical account of aging			0
" we are a family through choice			0
" when it comes to choosing alternative housing arrangements in @entity4 , shared apartments are n't the only option			1
across the country , multi-generational homes combine assisted living apartments for seniors with nursery schools and allow elderly tenants to remain in the neighborhoods they grew up in			1
" we have n't built a nursing home in 10 years and we do n't plan on building any , " says @entity135 , chief executive of the @entity136 , a foundation providing long - term care services			1
instead , the foundation offers multigenerational residential buildings such as the @entity140 , or @entity141 in the @entity142 , where seniors can rent one of 85 apartments with round - the - clock assistance and a nursery school next door			2
" there is an @entity156 saying that goes ' you need a whole village to raise a child , ' " @entity135 says as children from the nursery school at the @entity151 pour into the yard for recess			0
" but i say that you need a whole neighborhood for an elderly person to live			2
" for @entity163 , 88 , who moved into one of the apartments at the multigenerational home over a year ago , maintaining her freedom is crucial			0
she has since joined a theater group , takes a language class , and goes to the gym			0
" i am completely independent , " @entity163 says			0
" here i am my own master			0
" back at the shared apartment in @entity3 , the rigors of life in a nursing home are also nowhere to be seen			2
the elderly tenants are free to go to bed and get up when they choose			2
relatives and grandchildren often spend the night in the apartment 's guest room			2
most of all , the residents keep busy and feel useful helping out with household chores or working on art projects			2
as lunchtime approaches , the day - time nurse prepares a dish of sweet - and - sour eggs , a reminder of childhood cuisine many of her patients are familiar with			0
the tenants shuffle over to the dining room table			0
" it 's all very normal here , " says @entity25 , who oversees the daily running of the apartment			2
" just like at home			0
