editor 's note : @entity2 is a leading @entity3 dissident and pro-democracy activist			1
he served a six - year sentence in @entity7 's @entity6 for his reporting on human rights abuses in @entity3			2
the @entity10 - based human rights organization , @entity11 19 , has described @entity2 as the " @entity3 @entity12 " and he has received more than a dozen human rights , press freedom and pro-democracy awards			1
he is the author of " @entity16 in @entity3 " ( @entity17 , 2008 )			0
@entity2 says @entity3 's leaders should be held to account for denying its citizens their liberties			1
( @entity21 ) -- this week world leaders will gather in @entity23 for the annual meeting of the @entity25			1
while @entity3 president @entity26 will be among them , @entity3 reject his claim to leadership			1
they strongly oppose any meeting or recognition of @entity26 , especially by president @entity31			2
the pro-democracy movement in @entity3 today unanimously believes that he enjoys his current position because he was " reappointed " president after stealing several million votes in june 12 presidential election			0
popular protests against this state of affairs have been met with bullets from the @entity3 regime			2
thousands were arrested and dozens were killed			0
opposition supporters have been tortured in jail and credible reports of rape have surfaced			0
in recent years the @entity49 media has not focused on the systematic human rights violations in @entity3 but rather on @entity3 's nuclear ambitions and @entity26 's rhetoric toward @entity53 and the @entity54			1
@entity3 are deeply upset by the general inattentiveness of the media and world leaders to their political protests			1
if you listen to the democratic voices of @entity3 and leaders of @entity3 's @entity63 there is a unanimous view that @entity26 's policies have severely undermined @entity3 national interests and he has inadvertently better served the interests of @entity53			1
although the regime has been able to reassert control due to severe repression recent events have led to important social transformations in @entity3			2
today there are many prominent names publicly opposing the @entity74 , @entity75			0
many open letters have been circulated that for the first time directly criticize him			0
@entity80 policy under @entity31 has also played a constructive role			0
the absence of military threats and new economic sanctions has given democracy activists more room to maneuver , posing new challenges to the regime			0
in order to deal with this internal crisis @entity75 's only option is to shift attention to @entity3 's relationship with the outside world -- the @entity80 in particular			1
by increasing verbal attacks on the @entity96 and exacerbating regional conflicts he hopes to draw the attention of both @entity3 and the world away from the systematic violations of human rights in @entity3			2
@entity3 's nuclear ambitions should not be considered the primary weak point for the regime			1
to a limited extent @entity75 and his disciples can manipulate the nationalist sentiment of @entity3 around this issue			0
the achilles heel for the regime today is the widespread and systematic violations of human rights against it own people			0
greater exposure and scrutiny of this key issue will generate more popular discontent toward the leaders of @entity3			2
@entity75 can not maintain regime loyalty or acquiescence in the face of these massive human rights violations			0
it is precisely these organized repressive measures that the @entity127 , in other contexts , has called " crimes against humanity			0
" although @entity3 , like the @entity80 and @entity53 , are not members of the @entity127 , charges can be brought against the @entity3 regime via the @entity133 -- similar to the process that led to the arrest warrant for @entity136 , the leader of @entity137			1
we in the @entity3 human rights movement can document , with certification from a team of international lawyers , that leaders of the @entity3 regime are guilty of crimes against humanity under @entity11 7 of the @entity145 that established the @entity127			1
today , the people of @entity3 are in need of the moral and spiritual support from people around the world			0
in the current circumstances the most important form of support would be to assist with the campaign of charging the leaders of @entity3 with " crimes against humanity " and to help disseminate this initiative so that it becomes the main avenue of engagement with @entity3 by the international community			2
we are seeking to place this issue at the top of the international agenda so that leaders of the @entity3 regime will think twice before traveling abroad as well as to make it morally unacceptable for leaders of democratic countries to extend a hand to @entity26			1
