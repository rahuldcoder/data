-- the @entity2 's top national monuments : build a great vacation around a spectacular island , forest , cliff dwelling , canyon , fossil bed , tower or volcano			1
1 ) @entity11 , @entity12 @entity11 has been entrancing people for nearly 1,000 years -- from when the @entity15 people first began building homes in the cliffs of @entity18			2
they 're easily seen on the monument 's @entity19 ; more ruins can be glimpsed in @entity22 to the north			1
travel snapshots : share your national park photos but archeology is n't the only reason to come here -- the monument is stunningly beautiful , with dramatic mesas and broad views across @entity33			1
all this only a 45 - minute drive from @entity35			2
2 ) @entity36 , @entity37 everything you want from @entity37 is here			2
deep green old - growth forests ( thanks to 100 inches of rain a year ) , rushing streams alive with salmon , a rugged coastline , and the largest collection of brown bears -- @entity49 grizzlies -- anywhere in the world			2
in fact , one of the best places to see brown bears anywhere ( from a safe distance ) is at @entity57 , on the island 's northern shore			1
@entity36 is wild but it is n't remote , just about 15 miles west of @entity61 and reachable by boat and floatplane			1
@entity64 even has cabins you can rent ; there are also wilderness lodges			2
top 10 national park beaches 3 ) @entity70 , @entity71 @entity70 in northern @entity71 is one of the longest continuously inhabited places in @entity74			1
but it 's no mere living history museum -- t 's still a vital part of life on the @entity78			1
you can see @entity80 from the canyon rim , or take a 2 - hour hike to see the ruin up close			2
and a number of @entity78 outfitters lead @entity86 , hiking and horseback trips into the canyon backcountry			2
nearest hotels are in @entity90			0
4 ) @entity91 , @entity92 who needs @entity94 when you can come to @entity97 monument about 90 miles north of @entity98 , @entity92 ? this eerie lunar landscape is the product of volcanic lava flows that stopped only about 2,000 years ago			1
( geologists say they could start up again , although no one seems too worried			0
) you can see it all on a 7 - mile loop drive or if you want to feel boot on lava , hike the @entity110 trail			0
5 ) @entity112 's @entity111 , @entity113 sure , moviegoers know @entity113 's @entity115 as the place where mankind met friendly aliens in @entity120 's " @entity119			1
" but nothing prepares you for the real thing : the 1,300 - foot chunk of granite rising out of @entity113 badlands is bigger than even the widest of wide - screen attractions			1
it 's a sacred site to @entity129 and @entity130 peoples ; once you see it ( say on the @entity133 , which circles the rock 's base ) you will understand why			1
33 perfect summer trips 6 ) @entity137 , @entity138 the " staircase " in the name is a vast series of rock terraces			0
the " @entity155 " is father @entity143 , the 18th century @entity145 explorer who started the habit of being awed and amazed by the landscape here : cliffs and hoodoos and the sinuous canyons of the @entity154 and @entity155 rivers			0
in @entity138 due east of @entity157 , @entity137 is so big -- 1.9 million acres -- that it would take a lifetime to discover it all			0
explore it by car on @entity161 and @entity162 ; even better , get out and hike to @entity163 or @entity164			0
numerous outfitters lead jeep and hiking trips into the area ; for creature comforts , you 'll find good food and places to stay in @entity173 and @entity143			0
7 ) @entity174 , @entity175 elephants ! tigers ! @entity178 ! all here in @entity175			0
well , not the living animals -- their ancestors , preserved in rock for eternity at the @entity184 northwest of @entity185			0
@entity174 's beautiful badlands contain some 50 million years worth of plants and animals ; you can get all that ancient natural history straight at the excellent @entity191			1
and the monument offers more than just looking at bones ; it 's also great for hiking , particularly in the @entity196 area , which explodes with wildflowers in spring and summer			1
8 ) @entity198 , @entity199 kaboom ! in 1980 , nearly 4 billion cubic yards of mountaintop blasted skyward in an instant			1
nearly 230 square miles of forest blown down or buried beneath volcanic ash and mud			1
even now , decades after an eruption that impacted nearly all of the @entity207 , @entity198 is ranked as the most famously unstable mountain in @entity74			1
the geology here is fascinating , of course , but so is the quieter spectacle of forests and meadows gradually reclaiming the mountain 's scorched slopes			1
must - sees include @entity217 and @entity218 and @entity219			0
10 great one - night escapes 9 ) @entity221 , @entity222 it seems that something so beautiful should n't be this easy to reach			0
@entity226 's favorite woods lie just across the @entity227 from @entity228 , but step onto its trails -- especially on a quiet weekday -- and you are in another world			1
the coast redwoods ( sequoia sempervirens if you want to get @entity237 about it ) grow 300 feet tall ; beneath them spread lush carpets of ferns and mosses			0
with most trails paved and relatively flat , this is a great place to take kids			0
10 ) @entity246 , @entity222 only 90 minutes south of @entity248 , @entity247 proves that @entity222 geology is just as creative as @entity250 , @entity251 and @entity252			0
the larger - than - life rock formations here were shaped both by ancient volcanoes and by the @entity257 , which runs through the monument			0
along with wild rocks , @entity247 has bragging rights to some of the state 's best spring wildflower displays			2
look sharp and you might even see a @entity222 condor : this is one of the endangered bird 's release sites			2
