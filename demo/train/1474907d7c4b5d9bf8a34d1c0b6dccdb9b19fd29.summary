-- the question of whether there should be @entity5 boots on the ground to fight @entity7 in @entity8 came up again sunday after president @entity9 said that despite his earlier vow not to commit @entity5 combat forces there , he was n't ruling out the possibility if confronted with the worst - possible situation			1
" there are always circumstances in which the @entity5 might need to deploy ground troops , " @entity9 said at the @entity15 in @entity16			1
" if we discovered that @entity7 had gotten possession of a nuclear weapon , and we had to run an operation to get it out of their hands , then yes , you can anticipate that not only would [ @entity29 chairman gen. @entity28 ] @entity27 recommend me sending @entity5 ground troops to get that weapon out of their hands , but i would order it			1
" the comments -- along with the release sunday of an @entity7 video depicting the aftermath of the beheading of @entity5 hostage @entity39 -- reignited the debate on the sunday morning talk shows			0
" i will tell you many of us feel , i think the @entity5 people feel , it would be a serious mistake for us to make a commitment of land troops into these theaters , " sen. @entity43 , @entity44 , told @entity45 on @entity0 's " @entity46			2
" former @entity56 presidential candidate @entity55 , however , thought @entity9 was wrong in ruling out sending @entity5 ground troops , saying on @entity58 ' " @entity57 , " " you do n't tell the enemy exactly what you plan on doing or what you wo n't do			1
" " as a result of the mistakes that have been made in the past on the president 's part , we now have terrible visions being shown on tv and of course a threat to ourselves here in the homeland , " @entity55 said			0
" and the right course for this nation is to do whatever it takes to destroy and defeat @entity7			0
" @entity27 has suggested at least twice that he would recommend @entity5 ground troops if he felt they were needed , although he has emphasized he has not yet decided it 's necessary to do so			2
@entity43 , when asked whether he would support troops if the current strategy is not enough , replied , " i can tell you there are many who are anxious to send troops forward , i am not one of them			0

president @entity9 lays out a worst - case *scenario* in which @entity7 gains a nuclear weapon
in such a case , the president says he *'d* use @entity5 ground troops against @entity7
*democrat* @entity43 , @entity56 @entity55 both take *exception*
