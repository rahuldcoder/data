-- a year ago sunday , @entity1 died of a single gunshot wound to the chest			1
her last moments -- captured on a cell phone camera and shown around the world -- catapulted her into the symbol of the postelection reform movement in @entity9			1
today , the @entity9 regime 's crackdown seems to have driven protesters off the streets			1
but the movement is not weakening , some analysts say			1
instead , it 's evolved into an online underground civil rights struggle , they say			1
" i think they 're going to continue to move forward , whether in the form of a green movement or another type of movement , " said @entity18 , a fellow at the @entity19			1
" it 's just , basically , this march of history			2
" @entity28 , 26 , was at an anti-government demonstration in @entity30 when she was felled by a single bullet to the chest			2
" she has been shot ! someone , come and take her ! " shouts one man in the shaky cell phone video that has since been seen around the world			0
the video then shows blood streaming from her mouth , then from her nose			0
her eyes roll to her right ; her body is limp			0
a man , who had accompanied her to the rally , is then heard pleading with her by name			0
" @entity49 , do not be afraid , do not be afraid , " he repeats			0
@entity28 was taken to a nearby hospital and , within a day , she was buried at @entity52 , the city 's largest @entity53 cemetery , on the outskirts of the capital			2
immediately afterward , she emerged as the face of the anti-government movement			1
even world leaders took notice			0
" we 've seen courageous women stand up to the brutality and threats and we 've experienced the searing image of a woman bleeding to death on the streets , " said president @entity61			2
eight days before @entity28 's death , @entity9 president @entity70 's landslide election victory unleashed massive demonstrations in the country			1
thousands of green - clad protesters took to the streets , accusing the government of rigging the elections			2
@entity9 's leaders called the uprising a foreign - led plot to overthrow the regime			1
it cracked down on the protesters -- with many killed and even more jailed			2
images of the bloody crackdown fueled worldwide outrage			0
@entity28 's pictures are still carried on placards at rallies outside @entity9			1
" she will become the image of this brutality , and of the role -- the truly significant role -- that women have played in fighting this regime , " said @entity90 of @entity91 in @entity92			0
" i think that women are the unsung heroes of the last few years			0
they are the ones who began chipping away at the authority , the absolute dictatorship of the mullahs			0
" @entity9 authorities continue to deny that security forces were responsible for killing @entity28			1
instead , they have offered at least three separate explanations			0
they have blamed the @entity109 , terrorists and supporters of the opposition movement themselves			0
one year after @entity28 's death , @entity9 officials have yet to announce a single arrest in connection with her killing .			1

@entity1 's death made her a symbol of @entity9 's anti-government movement
struggle has evolved into an online , underground one , analysts say
protesters still carry her picture at rallies
@entity9 has not made an arrest in connection with her death
