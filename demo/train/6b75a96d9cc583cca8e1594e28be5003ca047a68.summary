-- within just a few days , @entity1 went from the height of ecstasy -- he had just gotten a much - needed kidney transplant -- to the depths of depression , after finding out his transplant would need to be removed			1
" i had been waiting for 10 years to finally have a normal life , " said @entity1 , a 27 - year - old from @entity9 , @entity10			1
" when it did n't work out , for a few days i just curled inward and started losing all hope			2
it was not an easy time			2
" what is notable about @entity1 's case is not that he eventually got over his depression , or that he had an organ removed after transplantation -- those things happen			1
what is remarkable is the simple , altruistic gesture he made just before his doctors removed his kidney that led to what scientists are describing as a medical first			2
fearing donated his transplanted kidney to another patient , and the organ that had been failing inside @entity1 's body thrived in the new recipient			1
" when we removed that dysfunctioning kidney from @entity1 's environment , it recovered rapidly after being transplanted in a second recipient , " said dr. @entity34 , @entity1 's doctor and medical director of the kidney transplant program @entity37			1
" it is the first time that has happened			2
" " it 's amazing stuff , it really is , " said dr. @entity45 , a nephrologist and president of the @entity47			1
" i do n't know if this is something we 're going to get into with great regularity , but the fact that these providers were able to think outside the box to save such a precious resource is frankly amazing			2
" @entity1 's kidney transplant was in june 2011 , using an organ donated by his sister , @entity60			1
he had been struggling for years with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis , a disease that causes scar tissue to develop in the part of the kidney that filters harmful substances			2
a few days after his operation , doctors took a biopsy of the new kidney and found it was quickly becoming damaged by the @entity72			2
the cascade of problems following the operation was swift			0
fearing said that soon after his operation , " my abdomen was full of blood and very sore and [ dr. gallon ] told me he had to remove the kidney immediately			0
" @entity34 said the situation , having to remove an organ to which so many hopes were now attached , haunted him			0
but when he realized the organ could still be viable in another patient , he decided to broach the idea with @entity87			0
" i said the kidney is yours , we can do whatever you want , " said @entity34 , who consulted with his hospital 's ethics board before approaching @entity87			1
" but if we take it out , we will discard it			0
are you willing to allow us to see if this kidney might work for someone else ? " @entity1 did not hesitate			1
" there are thousands of people waiting for organs , i could n't see myself just discarding one , " said @entity1			1
the window of time in which to remove an organ that has been transplanted is narrow , said dr. @entity106 , director of the kidney transplant program at the @entity108			1
once a kidney is put into place , like any other transplant , it develops scar tissue around it			1
" after a period of time , technically it is very difficult to remove it , " said @entity106			0
" it is equally difficult to think about transferring it to someone else			0
" @entity106 said he just had scenario similar to @entity1 's : a mother donated a kidney to her daughter , who suffers with @entity72			1
ultimately , the kidney had to be removed			0
" hearing about this case , i 'm thinking ' wow , what a cool idea , ' " said @entity106			0
" i do n't know why we did n't think of it			0
" of course , the procedure undertaken at @entity37 is not standard ; an organ with even marginal functionality would usually stay in the patient			0
" in this case we 're not talking about a lack of perfect function , " said @entity34			0
" we 're talking about a kidney making @entity1 sicker than it would have been to keep the kidney in			1
" but that kidney would ultimately make another patient , 67 - year - old @entity142 , better			1
@entity142 's kidneys were irreversibly damaged , he said , after 20 years of struggling with hypertension			0
once he received the new kidney , whatever damage that had occurred while it was implanted in @entity87 was reversed			0
" the disease , if captured early enough , is reversible when you remove the organ from the original recipient , " said @entity34			0
" but another part of the story is that when a patient 's kidney failed , he had the strength to say ' let 's help someone else			1
' that gesture has more weight than words			0
" the reality fearing faces now is a long , difficult wait for another @entity163 , receiving @entity165 's organ means he could go back to work as a cardiovascular surgeon , and he has more time with his grandchildren			1
" i feel bad for him because his misfortune is my gain , " said @entity142 , who on wednesday met @entity1 and his sister , @entity170			1
" i 'm completely grateful to them for considering re-transplanting that kidney ... i owe them eternal gratitude			0
" fearing said that when he thinks about other people ( 91,836 and counting ) waiting for a kidney transplant possibly benefitting from what he went through , it stems the tide of sadness he sometimes feels about his situation			2
" it was hell when i went through it , " said @entity1			2
" it is better that my situation helps people than having it take over my life			0

" it 's amazing stuff , it really is , " says president of the @entity47
