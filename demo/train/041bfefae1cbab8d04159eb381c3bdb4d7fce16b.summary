@entity0 -- a man who took a dangerous selfie during the running of the bulls in @entity6 , with the half - ton beasts right behind him , is still on the run -- but this time from the police			1
the thin , bearded man , so - far unidentified , faces a fine of about $ 4,100 ( 3,000 euros ) under new @entity6 city rules that aim to make the globally famous bull running slightly safer			1
the eight consecutive days of running ended on monday , with a total of 42 people taken to hospital during the week			1
among them , eight men who were gored , including three foreigners -- @entity21 @entity20 , 32 , of @entity22 , and two @entity23 , ages 26 and 24 , whose names were not immediately released			0
the so - called " selfie man " escaped injury on the tumultuous fifth day of the running last friday , but could have caused harm to himself or others , which is why authorities passed the new rules			1
carrying any device to record video or take pictures is prohibited during the running , because it distracts the runner from trying to stay out of harm 's way , and doing anything that endangers others is considered a serious offense , according to the city 's new rules			2
on @entity50 state television 's official video of the running , the selfie man is seen toward the end of the 850 - meter , or half - mile , course holding a recording device that looks like a phone , high in his right hand			1
this is just before the bulls enter the bullring on a downhill slope , and the pace is fast			0
the man appears on the video at one minute and 56 seconds after the run began , on the right of the street , with the bulls a few steps behind			2
at 01:57 , he turns his head , left over his shoulder to glance back at the bulls , still holding the camera , and at 01:58 he starts to head for cover on the left side of the street			0
he dashes across the street in the middle of oncoming runners -- somehow not colliding with any of them - and he 's off camera by 01:59 , the video shows			2
police have not yet found this man , who was wearing a traditional red long - sleeve top and white pants			0
the most dangerous day of the running turned out to be the last , on monday			0
a brown bull became separated from the pack on a well - known curve , not quite halfway in to the course , and caused havoc			0
there were just five injuries by goring in the previous seven days , but on the final day , there were three more gorings			0
these included the two @entity23 men , with the 26 - year - old listed in serious condition with three separate goring wounds , and the 24 - year - old receiving a goring to his right thigh ; and a 21 - year - old @entity50 man who was also gored three times			1
@entity20 , of @entity22 , who was gored on the third day of the running in his right thigh , had just co-authored a book , entitled : " @entity107 , how to survive the @entity108 of @entity6			1
" other contributors to the book include @entity110 , grandson of @entity111 , who brought global fame to the ancient tradition though his 1920s novel , " @entity107 , " also published under the title , " @entity107			0
