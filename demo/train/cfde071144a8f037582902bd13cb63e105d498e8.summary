-- next time there 's a mass shooting , do n't jump to blame the @entity3 and lax gun laws			1
look first at the shooter and the mental health services he did or did n't get , and the commitment laws in the state where the shooting took place			1
strengthening gun control wo n't stop the next mass shooter , but changing our attitudes , the treatment options we offer and the laws for holding the mentally unstable and mentally ill for treatment just might			1
take the case of the recent mass shooting incident in @entity21 , @entity22			1
police say @entity24 went on a killing spree near the @entity27 campus in @entity28 , shooting and stabbing victims , killing six and wounding 13 before he killed himself			2
he had legally purchased three guns , passed a federal background check and met several other requirements in one of the most liberal states with the toughest gun control laws in the country			2
@entity22 was one of eight states that passed major gun reforms in the wake of 2012 's @entity41 , in which a lone gunman killed 20 children and six adults			2
in fact @entity22 's gun control laws received an " a- " grade from both the @entity49 and the @entity50 to @entity51 , the @entity52 reported			2
in this climate , how did @entity24 succeed in his lethal plan ? it was n't the gun laws , it was the lack of common sense mental commitment laws			1
a 2014 report by the @entity60 , a nonprofit aimed at removing the stigma of mental illness and barriers to treatment , analyzed the state of mental commitment laws state by state , looking at both the " quality of involuntary treatment ( civil commitment ) laws which facilitate emergency hospitalization during a psychiatric emergency and the availability of court orders mandating continued treatment as a condition of living in a community			1
" on virtually all counts , @entity22 received an " f " ( it got a " c " on emergency evaluation )			0
in @entity24 's case , a friend concerned about alarming videos he 'd posted on @entity84 had alerted a county mental health staff member , and police had conferred with his mother , but this was not enough to get him committed			1
under @entity22 's @entity91 , a person must be a danger to himself or others before he can be held for 72 hours for evaluation , and the standard is even higher to mandate treatment			2
police visiting @entity24 found him to be " polite and courteous " and not an apparent danger , so they had no authority to detain him or search his home for weapons to seize			0
the reason had nothing to do with gun laws			2
it had to do with the commitment laws in @entity22			2
we need to adopt a nationwide standard for involuntary civil commitment , and that standard should be " need for treatment			1
" if a family member , law enforcement officer or mental health professional is concerned about the well - being of an individual , they should be able to have that individual held for a mental health evaluation			1
indeed , the @entity60 's report describes the exact situation police found themselves in when they conducted that " well - being " check on @entity24 : " but what if the person is neither threatening violence against anyone nor at any apparent imminent risk of injuring himself ? what if the concern spurring the family member to seek help is simply that the person is suffering , tormented by terrifying delusions , yet somehow unaware that he is ill ? do we as a society have reason to intervene ? to answer ' yes , ' we must believe there is a compelling societal imperative beyond preventing imminent injury or death -- an imperative to liberate a person from a hellish existence he would never -- in his ' right mind ' -- choose			2
" the truth is that commitment laws should n't be a stopgap to prevent imminent harm , but rather seen as an essential tool to help a loved one needing treatment before things reach the imminent harm stage			1
next , we 've got to connect the dots between mental health records and @entity154			1
in 2014 , @entity155 released a report calling for states to close this gap			0
it found that 11 states and the @entity161 have no reporting laws , and another 12 states have submitted fewer than 100 mental health records to the national background check system			1
but connecting the dots wo n't help unless every gun sale is subject to an instant background check imposed on all licensed gun retailers			0
and finally , the police need tools as well			0
they need training and the discretion to ask about and remove guns from any household where there is a domestic dispute , a call for a " well - being check , " or a person who exhibits violent or unstable behavior			0
they also need a mental health professional on call for such checks			1
@entity187 , @entity188 and , yes , even @entity189 have firearms seizure statutes aimed at dangerous persons			0
laws like these enable the police to temporarily remove guns from someone who is exhibiting dangerous behavior until a judge can make a final determination on fitness for gun ownership based on evidence presented at a hearing			0
i know what you 're thinking			0
" this will only penalize gun owners			0
most gun owners are law - abiding citizens			0
and most gun owners believe in responsible ownership and agree that these mental health measures make sense you may also be thinking : " but most people suffering from serious mental illness are nonviolent			1
" you 're right about that , too			0
indeed , mentally ill people only account for a small fraction of the gun deaths in @entity222 every year and the vast majority of those are suicide , not homicide			0
violence by the mentally ill is usually a symptom of the untreated mental illness -- that 's why access to treatment , not gun control , is the answer			1
overhauling mental health laws would give family members and professionals more responsibility and authority in care decisions			1
and in some cases , medications and therapies should not be optional			0
we 've got a major problem on our hands			0
and since guns are n't going anywhere , the discussion about solutions needs to place the focus somewhere else			0
even the @entity3 agrees that the seriously mentally ill should never own a gun			2
so let 's finally do something about it .			0

@entity256 : when there 's a mass shooting , do n't blame @entity3 , blame mental health laws
she says we must adopt nationwide " need for treatment " standard for civil commitment
she says mental health laws prevented cops from holding @entity21 shooter before *rampage*
@entity273 : fixing mental health laws would give families , professionals more control
