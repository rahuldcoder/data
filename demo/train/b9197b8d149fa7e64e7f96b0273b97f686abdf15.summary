@entity0 -- about a year ago , a former quarterback with the @entity3 and a retired linebacker with the @entity5 lifted their once - sturdy frames onto a cold examination table			0
meanwhile , a radioactive chemical was coursing through their bodies on its way to receptors in their brain tissue			0
a hum filled the room as each man slid toward a doughnut - shaped opening on a brain scanner			2
when their scans were later analyzed , crimson and bright yellow bands appeared deep in their brains , indicating damage			0
the two former players , @entity26 and @entity27 , were participants in a pilot study at @entity29 that may have found a destructive protein called tau in the brains of five living retired @entity35 players			1
@entity36 is significant because it has been found -- posthumously -- in the brains of dozens of former @entity35 players , including @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 and @entity44			1
all committed suicide and were later diagnosed with a disease called chronic traumatic encephalopathy			0
some scientists call finding the disease in the brains of living players the " holy grail " of @entity54 research , a way to diagnose and treat it			1
the @entity29 study may turn out to be an important first step in that effort			1
but at this early juncture , the small study poses more questions than answers			2
study authors say both had tau in their brain tissue , yet they are on opposite ends of the cognitive spectrum			1
@entity27 , 60 , has been diagnosed with early stage dementia , while @entity26 , 65 , is cognitively normal			1
@entity71 : why i 'm donating my brain " the sample is too small , and we do n't know enough to make much sense about this , " said dr. @entity74 , lead author of the study , which appeared last week in the @entity77 of @entity78			2
@entity26 's brain scan -- as crude a picture as it provides of his brain function -- showed bright patches of red and yellow in key areas of the brain associated with rage , depression and memory problems			1
the hypothesis of the study is that the more concentrated the tau protein , the more red and yellow appears on the scan			1
yet @entity26 says the worst thing that happens to him daily is occasionally forgetting the name of someone he just met			2
" he 's in his mid- 60s and just has normal aging , has mild memory complaints typical for somebody that age , " said @entity74 , professor of psychiatry at the @entity103 at @entity29			2
" so we need to do more studies of players with symptoms , more studies of players without symptoms , and see what the correlations are			0
" in contrast to @entity26 's scans , @entity27 's were flecked with red here and there , but most of his scan was greenish in hue , suggesting less tau			1
when his wife got the news that researchers may have found tau in @entity27 's brain , she was anything but surprised			1
his cognitive decline has been slow and , at times , painful			0
but when @entity134 , who is separated from her husband , considered the possibility that another player has tau but no cognitive problems , she remained unfazed			0
" i think that as with anything , our bodies are all different , " she said			0
" there are some players that are deeply affected and other that are n't			0
" scan may detect signs of @entity35 players ' brain disease she knows that story well , recalling @entity27 's roommate when he played for the @entity5			1
" they entered the league the same year , played the same position , used the same equipment , had the same coaches , " but today the former roommate is cognitively normal			0
@entity26 and @entity27 are around the same age , but that 's where their similarities end			1
@entity26 started playing football in high school and was not a sought - after college recruit			1
he made it to the @entity35 and mostly lingered on the sideline as a backup quarterback			2
" i did n't personally feel at risk at all because i did n't take the steady contacts that other players did , " @entity26 said			2
@entity27 , on the other hand , began playing at a younger age , was a first - round draft pick when he entered the @entity35 , and by the time his career ended in 1985 , he had played football for more than 20 years			1
quarterbacks like @entity26 -- especially backups -- get nowhere near the number of hits linebackers like @entity27 suffer			1
in fact , the highest - profile cases of @entity54 thus far have primarily been diagnosed among linemen and linebackers , positions where hits to the head occur on virtually every play			2
" one of the arguments is that it may have less to do with the number of concussions but more the number of sub-concussive impacts over the course of a player 's career , " said @entity189 , director of the @entity190 at the @entity191 at @entity192			0
that might explain @entity26 's lack of symptoms			2
@entity206 , @entity207 planning $ 100 million player study another popular theory among researchers is that the stark cognitive difference between players like @entity26 and @entity27 could boil down to genetics			1
@entity74 points out that when it comes to alzheimer 's disease , which shares some symptoms with @entity54 , there are certain genes , like @entity219 , that predispose people to worse cognition			0
so could @entity27 be genetically more vulnerable to cognitive problems ? or was it the sheer number of hits he took to the head compared with @entity26 ? " everything needs to be put on the table , " said @entity189 , a concussion expert			1
" it may be something environmental , it may be genetic			0
what we need to focus on is what creates this perfect storm			0
" @entity74 is realistic about the study -- despite his confidence in the early findings -- and the need for much more data to explain what that perfect storm looks like			0
" i would say to ( @entity26 ) , ' yes , i know that you have a scan that looks different , ' but we do n't know what that means yet , " @entity74 said			0
" what i suspect is that it 's not just the scan			0
there may be a lot of other variables that come into play that determine whether there 's a close correlation between the tau deposits in the brain and any clinical symptoms			1
" former football star @entity40 's family sues @entity35 , @entity260 helmets			0

former @entity35 players @entity26 and @entity27 participated in a @entity29 study
the protein tau , linked to a brain disease , was found in both of their brains
@entity27 has early - stage dementia ; @entity26 does not
researchers say other variables may come into play when it comes to the disease
