@entity0 -- @entity2 failed thursday to win a procedural vote to open debate on a bill that would provide medical benefits and compensation for emergency workers who were first on the scene of the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks			1
the motion for cloture , or to begin debate , needed 60 votes to pass due to a @entity16 filibuster , but fell short at 57 - 42 in favor			1
while supporters said they would try to bring the bill up again , either on its own or as part of other legislation to be considered , the vote thursday jeopardized the measure 's chances for approval in the final weeks of the current congressional session			0
the @entity27 previously passed the bill on a mostly partisan 268 - 160 vote			0
@entity31 mayor @entity30 reacted to thursday 's result by calling it " a tragic example of partisan politics trumping patriotism			1
" " i urge @entity2 @entity16 to reconsider their wrong - headed political strategy and allow the bill to come to the floor for a vote , " @entity30 said in a statement			0
republicans complained that the $ 7.4 billion price tag was too high , while @entity2 said the government had an obligation to help the first responders to the deadliest terrorism attack in @entity49 history			2
the @entity50 -- named after a deceased @entity52 detective who had worked in the toxic plume at ground zero -- seeks to provide free medical coverage for responders and survivors who were exposed to toxins after the attacks .			0
