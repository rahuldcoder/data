@entity0 sen. @entity0 of @entity1 won his primary showdown on tuesday , easily topping the 50 % threshold needed to avoid a runoff			1
his victory over a crowded field on the right stands in contrast to @entity11 majority leader @entity10 's defeat in @entity13 's 7th @entity12 , where @entity15 challenger @entity14 upset the seven - term @entity15 for the party 's nomination			0
big upset : no. 2 @entity11 @entity15 loses primary @entity0 's opposition was fractured heading into the primary			1

" leadership and problem solving comes with some political risk			0
you get a bunch of people running against you , but i 'm here to tell you , it 's very much worth it , " @entity0 said in his victory speech			2
in red - state @entity1 , @entity0 will be considered the strong favorite in november 's general election , when he faces @entity39 state sen. @entity38 , who easily won his party 's primary			1
@entity1 is not @entity42 @entity0 's victory also stood in contrast to @entity15 sen. @entity46 's fight for his political life in @entity42			1
last week , @entity46 was forced into a runoff against a challenger backed by the tea party			0
but for @entity0 , any comparison with @entity46 was short lived , even though many tea party activists and other grassroots conservatives in @entity1 despise him and other local organizations in the state have censured him in recent years			1
@entity0 had some advantages heading into the contest : he had a massive war chest -- around $ 8 million cash on hand , which gave him a huge campaign cash advantage over his primary opponents -- and outside groups have steered clear of the race , unlike in @entity42 where establishment and tea party groups fought			1
@entity1 @entity15 consultant @entity67 told @entity68 that @entity0 was facing off " against an incredibly weak field of competitors , and of course he benefited by having the ' not @entity0 ' vote split among several folks			1
" " @entity76 , to @entity0 's credit , he ran a great campaign			2
i think the assumption among a lot of people was that he 'd solely wage an air war , but i 've been impressed with the way he also ran a traditional , grassroots - focused campaign in addition to a compelling broadcast message			0
and @entity0 himself spent a lot of time on the ground here holding events and interacting one - on - one with voters , " @entity67 added			2
@entity0 debated his opponents for the first and only time this past weekend			2
they slammed him over his 2008 vote in favor of the @entity98 bailout , his votes in favor of president @entity103 's @entity102 nominations , and especially for his support of immigration reform			0
@entity103 : midterm elections will decide the fate of immigration reform maybe immigration reform is n't dead after all @entity0 was a member of the bipartisan " @entity113 " senators who pushed immigration reform through the chamber last year			2
