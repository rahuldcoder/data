-- @entity1 was an immature college kid who invaded his roommate 's privacy			1
in @entity6 , that makes him a convicted felon who faces up to 10 years in prison			2
locking up @entity9 ultimately wo n't do much to stop bullying or fight homophobia			1
his prosecution speaks volumes , however , about @entity15 's rush to use criminal justice to address problems that are better resolved by other means			2
every bad act is not a crime			1
every kid who does a stupid thing is not a criminal			1
as the whole world knows , @entity9 secretly videotaped his roommate , @entity26 , having sex with another man			1
he let some other people watch the video , and he tweeted that @entity31 was gay			1
@entity32 then jumped off a bridge to his death			0
a lot of people want a pound of flesh from @entity9 because they blame him for @entity32 's death			1
@entity31 's reaction was tragic , and it was idiosyncratic			0
it is possible to deeply mourn @entity32 's death and also to acknowledge that he probably had issues other than @entity9			1
no judge in the country would have allowed a homicide prosecution , because , legally speaking , @entity9 did not cause the death , nor was it reasonably foreseeable			1
of the millions of people who are bullied or who suffer invasions of privacy , few kill themselves			1
but in the classic fashion of overreaching prosecutors , the @entity6 district attorney found 15 other crimes to charge @entity9 with			1
legal experts expect that he will get at least a five - year prison sentence and then be deported to @entity60 , where he was born but has n't lived since he was 2			1
for his stupidity , @entity9 should be shamed by his fellow students and kicked out of his dorm , but he should not be sent to prison for years and then banished from the @entity15			1
in their hearts the prosecutors must know this , which is why they offered him a plea bargain that included no jail time and a recommendation against deportation			0
but prosecutors do n't like it when a defendant exercises his constitutional right to go to trial , and after winning their case they are likely to ask for big time			2
the prosecution seemed to play on the emotional circumstances of @entity32 's death as much as the actual facts of the case			0
the most serious charge was that @entity9 intended to intimidate @entity32 by filming him having sex with another guy			1
but how can you intend to intimidate someone by filming him when you hide the camera and do n't want the person to know he 's being filmed ? in addition , @entity6 's hate crime law presents troubling @entity95 issues			2
if @entity9 had been convicted of being motivated to act because someone was fat or a nerd , he 'd be looking at five years in prison			1
because he commented on @entity32 's sexual orientation , he gets twice as much time			0
the problem with broad laws like @entity6 's is that they come too close to punishing people for what they think			0
bigotry , including homophobia , is morally condemnable , but in a free country , it should not be a punishable offense			0
when i was a freshman at @entity113 , my roommate constantly played a @entity115 record called " @entity116			0
" i hated the song , but it never occurred to me that i should have called the police on my roommate			0
part of the reason @entity113 paired me , an @entity112 from @entity121 , with my roommate , a @entity123 kid from @entity124 , was for us to learn how to work out our differences			2
we did , and now , 25 years later , we 're still friends			0
those kinds of lessons are what college is for , as much as anything you learn in the classroom			0
@entity9 and @entity32 never had that moment , but at the trial , evidence was presented that it might have happened			2
after @entity9 had spied on @entity32 , he heard that @entity32 wanted a new roommate			1
@entity9 texted him and asked him to reconsider			2
he said , " i 've known you were gay and i have no problem with it			0
" this does not sound like a homophobe -- it sounds like a freshman who was taking a step to becoming more mature			0
@entity9 did not invent homophobia , but he is being scapegoated for it			1
bias against gay people is , sadly , embedded in @entity15 culture			2
until last year people were being kicked out of the military because they were homosexuals			0
none of the four leading presidential candidates -- president @entity154 , @entity155 , @entity156 , @entity157 -- thinks that gay people should be allowed to get married			2
a better way to honor the life of @entity32 would be for everyone to get off their high horse about a 20 - year - old kid and instead think about how we can promote civil rights in our own lives			0
though a national conversation about civility and respect would have been better , as usual for social problems , we looked to the criminal justice system			0
the @entity15 incarcerates more of its citizens than any country in the world			0
we are an extraordinarily punitive people			0
@entity32 died for @entity15 's sins			0
and now , @entity9 faces years in prison for the same reason			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity181 .			2

@entity1 is found guilty of *spying* on and intimidating his gay roommate @entity26
@entity181 : @entity9 was immature , but sending him to prison wo n't stop bullying or fight homophobia
millions of people are bullied or suffer invasions of privacy , but few kill themselves
@entity195 : every kid who does a stupid thing is not a criminal , every bad act is not a crime
