the @entity10 capital is one of the world 's foremost financial and business hubs , but given the expected influx of nearly 550,000 tourists and sports fans every day during the @entity17 , accommodation will be at a premium and getting around will be trickier than usual			1

whilst it may still be possible to secure one of @entity1 's 120,000 hotel rooms at short notice , a cheaper option may be to head out to one of the city 's nearby commuter towns			1
