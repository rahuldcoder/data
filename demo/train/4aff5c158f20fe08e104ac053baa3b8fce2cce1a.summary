-- @entity2 side @entity1 are a " sinking ship " under current coach @entity7 , according to one of their players			1
@entity8 joined the @entity10 club in september 2008 on a four - year deal but has been a peripheral figure this campaign			1
@entity1 finished second in the @entity2 behind @entity14 last season but the 18 - time title winners have n't won a trophy since 2006			1
the club are currently in sixth place , 15 points behind league leaders @entity14 , were knocked out of the @entity21 in the group stages and dumped out of the @entity23 by second tier side @entity24			0
now @entity8 has laid the blame at @entity7 's door in an interview with @entity32 radio station @entity31 : " when the coach says nothing to you and you are well , with no physical problems and training well , you can not help but think it must be something personal			1
" if i 'm doing something badly and you are my boss , and you value me , then you are going to come and tell me what i have to do to play again			0
this is what hurts me			0
when you see a ship is sinking and do n't do anything			1
" it 's a little frustrating because you see that you can help			0
i 've been here two years and i know how he ( @entity7 ) is			1
he 's never sorted out a situation with a player by talking with him			0
he thinks he 's in charge and everything else falls on deaf ears			0
his dialogue with the players is practically nil			2
" his comments were later criticized by former @entity1 and @entity56 international @entity55 , who made 283 appearances for the club between 1999 and 2006			1
he suggested to the @entity60 @entity59 that @entity8 was n't in the team because his form has n't been up to scratch since joining from @entity63			1
" i did n't read too much into the comments because he 's a player who has not played too much football over the last six to eight months , " @entity55 said			0
" he is clearly frustrated but you have to say since he signed for @entity1 he has not done enough to really have an opinion on the manager			2
" if @entity8 is not in the team it is probably because he is not doing enough in training or in games			2
you have players these days who complain about managers and i think these players should look at themselves			0
" @entity8 is concerned that his lack of first - team football will affect his chances of going to the @entity81 with @entity82 , and he says he is considering offers from @entity85 clubs			1
he added on @entity86 : " i would like to be here for the rest of my career , but players live to play			0
my objective is to go to the @entity81 and for this i have to play			2
" right now the only market open is the @entity85 one , i have offers from two teams and , looking at my situation , that has made me reflect a lot			0
