@entity0 really -- really -- wants to serve in @entity1			1
so much so , that he plans to run in four states : @entity3			1
it 's puzzling , but the @entity8 freely admits his strategy increases his odds of winning a @entity13 seat			1
as he sees it , all roads lead to @entity17			0
" no matter where you win a seat in @entity1 , you go to the same building			1
you do the same work , " he said			0
" you can work for your constituents , which all have similar needs , but the key is you go to @entity30 and help solve the country 's problems			2
" legally , his strategy is possible			2
but it likely will be a logistical nightmare			0
running a congressional campaign as a political newcomer is tough enough			2
multiply that by four and add a society that 's quick to shun " carpetbaggers " -- people who move to a state to run for office -- and you get what some experts predict to be a waste of time and money			1
it appears @entity49 may be the first to try the unusual tactic			1
but what if he succeeds ? is he blazing a trail for a new campaign model ? jumping through the loophole the @entity56 lists only a few requirements for a @entity13 member : be at least 25 , a @entity60 citizen for at least seven years and a resident of the state when elected			1
but the @entity56 says nothing about primaries or the nominating process , and that 's the heart of @entity49 's strategy			1
the top 12 campaign questions of 2014 leaving out a rule that would prevent multi-state campaigns was an understandable omission by the @entity71 , @entity0 said			1
how could they have envisioned such an approach ? " back then they could n't fly from state to state , " he said			1
in @entity0 's case , all four races are open , meaning there 's no incumbent			1
two districts â € ” the ones in @entity3 and @entity4 â € ” are considered safe for @entity8 , while the other two are considered safe for @entity84			1
the four states only require candidate residency at the time of the general election , not the primary			2
they also do n't have laws prohibiting candidates from running in the primary if they 're attempting to get on primary ballots in other states			1
the @entity95 tracks the money side of federal campaigns			0
it told @entity0 his mission was legal as long he kept his fundraising separate in each state , meaning he could n't raise money in @entity3 and spend it in @entity4			1
the @entity95 told @entity103 it has n't issued specific guidance on that kind of campaign strategy			1
' all politics is local ' @entity0 , an avid blogger with some unorthodox ideas , has already created websites for each of his campaigns			1
but his true focus is on @entity3 's 11th @entity113 , whose current representative , @entity8 @entity114 , is running for the @entity115			1
of the four states , @entity3 holds its primary first , on may 20			1
if @entity0 does n't win the @entity8 nomination , he 'll campaign in the other states			1
@entity4 , @entity5 and @entity6 have nominating contests in august , just days apart from each other			1
@entity122 , a @entity8 political consultant based in @entity123 , said he 's never heard of someone trying to run in multiple states and argued it 's not a " viable political strategy			1
" " there 's two problems : there 's the practical day - to - day issues , like scheduling , fundraising , meetings , etc , " @entity122 said			2
" if you get past that , you still have a problem , to me , with voters about political opportunism			0
" @entity103 poll : @entity8 has edge in early midterm indicator a number of people , including @entity122 , brought up a common saying coined by former house speaker @entity146 : " all politics is local			0
" " it 's very much true in @entity6 , " said @entity148 , chairman of @entity6 's @entity8			1
" people care what high school you went to , what nationality you are , what your last name is , how many generations your family has been in @entity6 , whether you know my auntie and uncle			1
" " being from the mainland and running for the office @entity6 , you have an uphill battle because of those dynamics , " he added			1
@entity0 has n't lived in @entity6 ; he has only visited the state			1
but he says he still has a plan specific to the @entity6			1
he wants to bring more it jobs and companies from @entity170 and make the island known for being more than a tourist hub			0
" it 's clear that you need a noisy , loud congressional mouthpiece			2
i am noisy and i will put @entity6 on the map , " he writes on his @entity6 website			2
born in @entity178 , @entity49 , 64 , first came to the @entity60 when he was 21 and eventually became a naturalized citizen			2
he pursued a career in the it industry and is now settled in @entity3 , but he has lived in @entity5 in the past , which is why he chose the @entity5 as one of his " four			1
" as for @entity4 , the 6th @entity113 has been a @entity8 stronghold for the past decade			2
its current representative , @entity184 , is retiring			0
@entity0 is attracted to races that would essentially guarantee him a general election victory if he wins the primary			2
" the election process is about winning first and foremost , " he said			0
but three well - known republicans have already been vying for the seat for months			0
" the runway for candidates who are serious about it literally started the day congresswoman @entity184 announced her retirement , " said @entity192 , chairman of the @entity193			0
@entity192 had not heard of @entity0 's plan to run in the state , but found it difficult to see voters gravitating toward an outsider			1
" i would imagine , like in most places , @entity4 voters are a little more comfortable voting for their own and having some past connection to a candidate , " he said			2
copycats in the future ? @entity0 is surely hedging his bets			2
but what if his plan works ? a source who worked to get @entity84 elected to the @entity13 last decade seemed open to the idea			0
" i wish we had known about that			0
maybe we could have gotten even more democrats elected , " the source said , somewhat jokingly			0
the source , who asked not to be identified , added the tactic could come in handy for candidates running in districts along state borders			2
7 keys to the 2014 midterms others had a hard time imagining the strategy becoming one for the textbooks			2
@entity122 said " some of the practical decisions would be easier " in such a scenario , but the candidate would still have a " messaging problem			0
" " you 're still looking like you just desperately want to be in @entity1 , regardless of the district or the issue , " he said			2
such an image does n't pass " the smell test " with voters , he added			0
another @entity13 campaign strategist , who asked not to be identified in order to speak more freely , had also never heard of the multi-state approach but said " it 's something that a credible strategist would never recommend for any candidate			1
" " you 're opening yourself up to several attacks , " the source said			0
' just ideas ' @entity0 realizes he will run into criticism and said he 's prepared to take on his opponents			1
" i 'm not carpet bagging in the sense that i want to take advantage of the district that i 'm running for , " he said			0
" i will work very hard for whichever district that i 'm elected to			0
" for @entity256 , he believes he must get elected to carry out his ideasâ € ” which include carving out a back - up territory for @entity259 inside of @entity123 , and creating a pathway for thousands of @entity262 nannies to come to the @entity60 and teach children how to speak @entity264			0
" having ideas without going to @entity30 means they 're just ideas , " he said in his americanized @entity266 accent			0
" no one will pay the slightest bit of attention			0
" he also wants to eliminate corporate income taxes			0
to combat " career politicians , " he wants to void pensions for members if they do n't leave office after four terms in the @entity13 or two terms in the @entity115			0
part of his rush to get elected stems from his expectation to live for only one more decade , a prediction based on family history			0
he 's also convinced the @entity60 currency will collapse by 2020			0
" my job is to stop that from happening			0
" if he does n't win any of the races , he and his wife plan to liquidate all their real estate and other assets , buy @entity293 francs and simply wait until the economy gets better			0
" if what i want to do does not resonate with the public , then the public will choose somebody else , " he said			0
" and that 's ok			0

@entity0 wants to run for @entity1 in @entity3 , @entity4 , @entity5 and @entity6
*constitution* and state laws do n't preclude the strategy
experts mostly say it could be a waste of time , but it could set a new campaign model
it 's believed @entity49 is the first to try the approach
