@entity0 -- president @entity2 on wednesday issued new orders aimed at speeding up transportation projects he says will put construction workers back on the job , using the opportunity to blast congressional @entity8 who have blocked similar legislation			1
standing before the aging @entity10 over the @entity11 , @entity2 again criticized @entity8 who have blocked the jobs bill he put forward in september , telling an audience of construction workers , " there 's work to be done			1
there are workers ready to do it			0
the @entity20 people are behind this , " he said			0
" democrats , republicans , independents believe in this			0
these are ideas that have been supported by all those groups in the past			0
there 's no reason not to do it this time			2
" the @entity31 announced wednesday that @entity2 was ordering the @entity33 award $ 527 million in pending road and bridge repair grants by the end of the year and speed up applications for another $ 110 million in financing for projects in 2012			1
the @entity31 and @entity33 are also setting up a team to speed reviews of other road and rail projects			1
" if there 's money already in the pipeline , we want to get it out faster , " he said			1
republicans filibustered the @entity52 version of the president 's $ 447 billion jobs proposal in mid-october , while a $ 35 billion measure that would have forestalled layoffs of state and local government workers like teachers and police officers was blocked a few days later			2
@entity8 leaders particularly opposed raising taxes on top earners to pay for the measures			2
" how do we sit back and watch @entity65 and @entity66 build the best bridges and high - speed railroads and gleaming new airports , and we 're doing nothing at a time when we 've got more than a million unemployed construction workers who could build them right here in @entity20 right now ?

" i trust in @entity81 , but @entity81 wants to see us help ourselves by putting people back to work , " he said .			0
