@entity216 's @entity215 @entity218 notes if it 's not natural , flame red hair can look costumey against nearly any complexion			1
but a coppery auburn with a wash of strawberry highlights like @entity223 's is flattering on skintones ranging from ultra-fair to tan and tawny			2

) and do take a tip from the star by asking that your brows be touched - up , too			2
the simple tweak enhances the overall sexiness of the shade			0
@entity237 's @entity236 @entity218 notes " this is just such a bright sexy blond , " says colorist @entity239 , who works with celebrities like @entity241 , @entity242 and @entity243			1
" to make it work for fall , just be sure to amp up your makeup a bit			2

" i gave her a base that accented her natural medium brown with lighter honey highlights throughout			0
then i lightened the tips with a shade for tones lighter than her darkest hair			0
it 's ombre , but without being severe			1
and it grows out gorgeously without becoming brassy			0

but one look at @entity328 's pitch - perfect strands changed our minds for good			1
