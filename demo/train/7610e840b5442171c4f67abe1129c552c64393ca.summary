@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 manager @entity3 says his star player @entity5 has taken on " another dimension " after the @entity8 midfielder was instrumental in the 6 - 0 thrashing of @entity10 in the @entity11			1
@entity5 grabbed two goals and set up two others as the @entity1 side demolished their @entity16 opponents and gave notice of their intent to land the biggest prize in @entity21 club football for the first time			1
after the 23 - year - old helped @entity8 to their first ever @entity25 win in @entity26 , he was the subject of intense speculation over a move to @entity31 champions @entity30 -- the club where he began his career			1
but after his performance on wednesday night , @entity3 insisted @entity5 " loved " @entity4 and is still improving as a player			1
" he has taken on another dimension			0
people forget that he is 23 years old , [ an age ] where other people start , " @entity3 told the club 's official website			1
" he is a fantastic influence and it is important that he leads this team to winning and i believe it is a fantastic opportunity for the young players who play alongside him to improve as well			1
" he loves this club			2
people doubted that but i never doubted that			0
he arrived here at the age of 16 and he enjoys the way we play and what more do you want than to be happy ? " @entity62 coach @entity61 was equally pleased with his team 's performance as they opened their @entity11 campaign with a 2 - 0 home win over @entity69 giants @entity68			1
an own goal from @entity68 defender @entity71 and a tap in from @entity73 secured victory for the @entity31 club , though the @entity77 striker and @entity79 international @entity78 both squandered several chances			1
@entity61 , who is aiming to become the first coach to win the @entity11 with three different clubs , told @entity62 's official website : " we played well			1
the team 's physical and mental strength increases by playing			2
we can improve little by little			0
i need time , but i am very optimistic			0
" @entity78 and @entity73 were great tactically			1
we had dynamic offense and stayed well - balanced			2
that is what i need to work on			0
some team is going to pay heavily for this lack of scoring and the scoreline is going to be huge			2
" @entity78 can solve his scoring anxiety by one day not playing so well and scoring two or three goals			1
you play and try your hardest , you build plays , you assist so that the team shines , but you ca n't score			2
it can happen , but the goals will come			0
" @entity106 champions and last year 's beaten finalists @entity108 beat @entity109 2 - 0 and coach @entity110 was pleased to eventually wear down his @entity112 opponents			1
" we played very well in the circumstances , " he told the club 's website			2
" we let the ball do the work , in the first half as well as the second			0
but we did n't create many chances			0
however , we never let a very good opposing team get going , although they only came here to defend , which always makes it difficult			0
" after 70 minutes , @entity109 stopped running , because they 'd been chasing the ball all night			0
that 's how we play it			0
the fans need to understand that we need time to run our opponents into the ground			0
we 've scored two good goals , and we could have had two more in the final minutes			0

@entity62 coach @entity61 *satisfied* as his team beat @entity68 2 - 0
