" i am @entity8 " has become the catchphrase for protesters expressing solidarity with the slain @entity4 teenager and outrage over his killing			1
even president @entity9 declared , " if i had a son , he would look like @entity8			1
" but who really was @entity8 ? there is plenty of speculation , including some bloggers who point to his recent school suspensions -- including for drug residue in his backpack -- and images of him sporting tattoos and a what appeared to be a gold tooth grill as possible evidence of a troubled teen			1
that portrayal is in stark contrast to the accounts from his family , friends , and teachers who described @entity8 as an average 17 - year - old			1
" he was a shy kid , " said family friend and former football coach @entity38			0
" he did n't want to be the center of attention ; that 's just not him			0
" he always walked with his hoodie and his headphones , " recalled @entity38			0
" if he was n't on the phone , he was listening to music -- anyone that knows him knows that			0
" just like most any other teenager , @entity8 enjoyed listening to music -- @entity51 was his favorite -- going to the movies and the roller rink with his friends , friends and family said			1
when @entity8 entered high school , his childhood goals of a career on the football field were replaced with his dreams of working with airplanes			1
" he just loves getting on planes , " said his father @entity63			1
during the summer of 2009 , his parents -- who separated when @entity8 was 11 , but shared custody -- enrolled their 14 - year - old son in " @entity69 , " a nonprofit program in @entity71 , @entity4 , that introduces young people to aviation			1
the seven - week program is the brainchild of @entity77 , the youngest person ever -- and the first black pilot -- to fly solo around the world , a feat he accomplished in 2007 at the age of 23			0
@entity77 remembered @entity8 as " a polite kid " who enjoyed flying			1
" when i first met @entity8 he had a strong interest in football			1
he reminded me of myself because i had a strong interest in football until i fell in love with aviation , " said @entity77			0
after graduating from the program , @entity8 spent the following summer as a volunteer , assisting new students enrolled in the aviation program			1
during high school , @entity8 also volunteered his time at the concession stand at @entity96 where he played football since age 5 , on a team coached by @entity38 and his father			1
" he would literally go to school and from school he would go to the park to volunteer to maybe about 8 , 9 o'clock and go home , " said @entity38			0
" that was @entity8 's day , his week			1
" @entity8 's mother transferred him from @entity107 's @entity106 to dr. @entity108 , closer to her home			1
" he was doing average in school , a little bit better when he was at @entity116 and then i had him transferred , '' @entity111 said , according to the @entity112			2
" i thought @entity108 was a better school and i wanted a different environment for him			0
my oldest son has graduated from there			0
'' in his junior year at @entity108 , @entity8 's favorite subject was math , according to his father			2
" he was just an average student , " he said			1
at @entity108 , @entity8 was suspended three times , according to records obtained by the @entity112 , once for writing graffiti on a door and another time for school truancy			1
the third suspension took place the week of his death			0
@entity8 was suspended for 10 days due to drug residue being found in his backpack			1
in an interview with @entity139 's @entity138 , @entity111 responded to her son 's suspension : " whatever he had dealings with the school , it was not criminal , it was not violent , he 's never been arrested			1
" @entity146 , a fellow football player and close friend , said @entity8 was no different from any other teen			1
" everybody gets in trouble , " said @entity146 , " everybody goes through it			0
" @entity146 remembered @entity8 as a " positive person " and a " good friend			2
" during the 10 - day suspension , @entity63 took his son with him to @entity157 , about four hours away from @entity107 , while he visited his fiancée because neither he nor @entity159 wanted their son to stay in his hometown where he could enjoy his friends , said @entity38 , who has been in close contact with @entity8 's father			1
" he was n't just suspended from school and up at @entity157 kicking it and having a good time , " said @entity38			2
@entity8 had only been to @entity157 a handful of times			2
his fateful walk to the convenience store for a bag of @entity174 and an iced tea on the evening of february 26 happened only because the teenager pleaded to leave the apartment , said @entity38			0
" the only reason he got a chance to go to the store is because he begged his dad to go , " he said			0
at the time , his father and his fiancée had gone out to dinner and to watch a basketball game , leaving @entity8 at the townhouse , according to @entity187 spokesman @entity186			2
while walking to the store , @entity8 was on the phone with his girlfriend , whom he had been talking to for over 6½ hours throughout the day , the family 's attorney said , citing phone records			2
the girl , who did not want to be identified , said she told @entity8 to run , but he refused , the family attorney said			2
" what are you stopping me for ? " @entity8 asked a man later identified as neighborhood watch captain @entity199 , according to the girl			2
" what are you doing around here ? " @entity199 asked in response			0
the girl said she then got the impression that an altercation was taking place and that someone had pushed @entity8 , because the headset fell out of his ear , and the phone shut off			2
moments later , @entity8 was shot and killed			2
the details of what happened are still murky			0
@entity199 has said through his legal adviser that he acted in self - defense after @entity8 attacked him			0
the family disputes that , and witness accounts vary			0
@entity159 told @entity139 's @entity218 that she believes @entity199 " hunted my son like an animal			0
" the teen 's killing has captivated the nation 's attention , with some saying this shooting of an unarmed teenager has exposed underlying racism			0
some also feel that it 's better to wait on the evidence before rushing to judgment on what happened that night			0
. others decry the " stand your ground " law that allowed @entity199 to walk away free of any criminal charges			0
as these broader issues continue to dominate the news headlines , the only thing that is certain is that @entity111 and @entity63 have lost their son			1
when asked for one word to describe @entity8 , @entity111 chose " lovable , " adding , " i miss his smile			0
" asked what he would say to @entity199 if he had a chance to speak to him , @entity63 had many questions : " i would ask him why did he in fact pick out my son , what was going through his mind that night ? " @entity8 told @entity218			1
" [ did ] he realize he 's destroyed an innocent child 's life ? my son had a future			0
my son was not one of these thugs in the night			1
" i would ask him , why did he in fact take my son 's life and how does he feel about taking my son 's life ? "			0
