one small crowdfunding investment online , one giant leap for @entity3 ? at least that 's the intention behind the @entity5 which aims to muster enough money through internet donations to send a probe to the lunar surface within a decade			1
the project has been proposed by the @entity11 , a non-profit based in @entity12 that seeks to increase awareness around space education and research			1
by reaching for the stars ( or moon , in this case ) , the idea is to energize the youth of @entity3 and beyond and to boldly take the continent where its never gone before			1
" we aim to inspire , to educate and then once the mission has started up , to do research and science , " the organization 's chief executive , @entity23 , told @entity0			2
the mission 's website proudly states that the probe could even be programmed to beam pictures of the experiments it undertakes to classrooms all across @entity3			1
online campaign but how will these ambitious plans be turned into reality and how likely are they to succeed ? @entity23 concedes that most people still regard an @entity3 nation going to the moon as a remote prospect			1
however , @entity42 has the backing of a number of @entity3 universities and the @entity46 among others			1
funds have been rolling in via an online donation page over the last month and the target is to reach $ 150,000 by the end of january to ensure the first stage goes ahead			2
as of publication , the mission has raised $ 21,600			2
if succesful , this initial cash will be used to develop a full lunar program as well as undertake an associated feasibility study			2
outreach and public participation events to garner publicity and create engagement will also be arranged			2
beyond this stage , suggestions from the scientific community around the world will be considered as to what experiments the probe should be designed to carry out			1
for example , should it orbit the moon or should it take the shape of a vehicle that can land on the surface and take samples ? " our research must fit in with the rest of the world in terms of making a contribution of getting a better understanding of the moon and the needs that the global community has , " @entity23 said			0
educational prospects while the ultimate goal is to follow the likes of the @entity89 , the @entity90 , @entity91 and @entity92 in getting up close to the lunar landscape , it 's the journey to that point that most interests @entity23 and the @entity11 given their focus on education			1
studies have shown that countries like @entity3 lag behind those in @entity103 and @entity104 in terms of the number of higher education graduates and phd students they produce			1
according to an article penned by @entity23 on the @entity5 website , meanwhile , one in nine @entity3 graduates also leaves the continent after completing their studies			1
this has a damaging long - term impact on the continent 's development and economic prospects			0
but an eye - catching mission to the moon could help reverse these trends , @entity23 believes			0
" the benefits wo n't only come in a decades time when the data starts to come through , " he said			0
" if we can get somebody into science , if we can get somebody to ask how are they going to get to the moon and somehow get them interested in any of the sciences and engineering , that 's our job done			0
" the great @entity3 space race a number of @entity3 nations have invested in space programs in recent years			1
@entity3 , @entity141 , @entity142 , @entity143 , @entity144 and @entity145 have all launched satellites to aid the likes of communications technology , navigation technology , agriculture , disaster management and mining			1
the likes of @entity154 , @entity155 , @entity156 , @entity157 and @entity158 have also voiced their commitment to follow suit with space programs of their own			1
on top of this , the @entity164 project in @entity3 's @entity166 desert will be the largest and most powerful radio telescope on earth when it comes online			1
construction on @entity164 -- which some have compared to @entity175 's @entity174 -- is set to begin in 2018			0
in a december interview with @entity0 , @entity177 professor and co-chair of the @entity179 's @entity180 , @entity181 , told @entity0 that such projects were vital to creating valuable and highly skilled workforces on the continent			0
others , however , have asked whether space programs or complex science projects are where @entity3 countries should be placing their focus given the many other problems facing the continent			1
this is not a point of view @entity23 has much sympathy for			0
removing the plaster " there 's no denying there 's poverty , " he said			0
" there 's @entity201 in western @entity3 , there 's religious unrest , there are a lot of trials and tribulations facing our continent and they do need to be dealt with			2
" " but if we pool everything into aid , it 's just a plaster or a band aid that does n't fix the problem			0
" instead , @entity23 suggests a more ambitious and joined up strategy that includes space ambitions will prove more fruitful in the long term			2
" we have to have education			0
education leads to opportunity and opportunity will lead to economic empowerment , " he explained			0
" beyond education you have to have skill retention			0
its no good creating an educated group who then migrate to better shores			0
then you lose that skillset and you lose those future leaders because you 're not providing for them			0
" " if we do n't do that what chance do we ever have of standing shoulder to shoulder so that one day people saying ' @entity3 goes to @entity240 ' is as normal as saying ' @entity89 goes to @entity240 , ' he said			2
