-- on wednesday , all over the @entity1 , " @entity3 " was the big trend			1
the date was july 11			2
or , put another way : @entity6			1
just add some bad character development , and you 've got the basic premise of a @entity13 movie			2
of course , it 's no coincidence that this particular word was trending on this particular day			1
july 11 was the official 85th birthday of the @entity6 convenience store chain , and to celebrate they were giving out free 7.11 - ounce @entity3			1
this apparently caused the @entity20 to have a collective aneurysm			2
the general consensus : " drink all the @entity3 ! ! ! " in fact , @entity6 was prepared to give away up to 10 million of these things across the @entity25 and @entity26			1
so , i attempted a little math , which ultimately ended in tears and a mild rash , and determined that 10 million @entity3 equals 71.1 million ounces			2
then i did some additional math , which resulted in more tears and a uniquely different rash , and found that 71.1 million ounces equals 555,468.75 gallons			1
then i got a completely unrelated rash and finally embraced the reality that i may need to see somebody			2
the point is , you could almost fill an olympic - size swimming pool with all the @entity3 they were planning to give away			1
granted , @entity41 would then promptly drink the pool to reach his daily caloric intake			1
and it would be cold			2
according to @entity6 , their famous " semi-frozen carbonated beverage " should be served at a " frosty " 28 degrees			1
which makes this next fun fact rather amazing : the no. 1 market in the world for @entity3 is @entity51 , @entity52			2
you know , where the average low temperature in january is minus 10 degrees			2
it makes absolutely no sense			0
perhaps they just like saying , " hey , let 's get a slurp - eh ? " or maybe @entity60 goes back after each tour and lathers himself in 60,000 ounces of @entity62			1
which would be both fascinating and disgusting			0
whatever the reason , this was unbelievable information i just could n't process			0
my phone conversation with the nice @entity6 pr lady went something like this : me : " @entity51 ? seriously ? @entity51 ? " her : " yep			1
" me : " hmm			0
so i 've got this rash ... " she also told me that , surprisingly , in the @entity25 , the no. 1 market is @entity76			0
but the no. 1 store for @entity3 is in @entity78 , @entity79			0
i 'm not sure what else to do with this information			0
i guess ... visit @entity78			0
of course , when it comes to straight - up soda , @entity6 also has the @entity85			1
these are great for when you absolutely , positively want to pee for 17 uninterrupted minutes			0
and if you 're really thirsty there 's the @entity6			1
this is enough to completely drown a small community			0
so , watch yourself , @entity78			0
without question , it 's a lot of soda			1
seemingly more than any one person needs			0
but the science does n't lie ; 50 ounces of caffeine is pretty much requisite for all mid-to long - range road trips			0
that , and beef jerky			0
it 's actually sort of amazing what personal health rules we 'll bend in the process of getting from @entity107 to point b when it requires slightly more effort than your standard commute			1
" honey , looks like we 're still 20 miles from @entity114			0
so you fill up the tank -- i 'll grab 36 @entity118			0
" and that 's why we have convenience stores			1
however , what 's not awesome is the fact that we do n't have @entity6 in @entity124			1
and now i really want a slurpee			2
so , i guess i 'm off to @entity78			0
you know ... before the flood .			0

" @entity132 " is @entity130 's *skewed* *weekly* look at trending *social* media *topics*
this week , @entity134 *ponders* the broad reach of @entity6 's free slurpee day
the company was prepared to give away 555,000 gallons of the *chilly* treat
also ? the @entity85 is big
