editor 's note : @entity2 is a political scientist at the @entity4 specializing in @entity6 politics and military affairs			1
@entity4 is a nonprofit institution that conducts research and provides analysis to address challenges facing the @entity11 and the world			0
@entity2 says the @entity14 attacks highlighted sources of violence in the region			1
( @entity18 ) -- as the last @entity14 sites were being cleared of terrorists , grim signs emerged of the challenges that face @entity23 and @entity24			1
unfortunately , beginning to know what the @entity14 attack was -- and what it was not -- only augurs more violence for @entity23			1
at least three factors are at play			0
first , the fact that the attacks thus far have been attributed largely to @entity24 terrorists does n't mean that @entity23 's internal challenges are less dire			1
@entity23 officials first claimed , based upon the reported testimony of the only surviving gunman , that the attack was perpetrated by 10 @entity24 associated with the @entity24 - based @entity40 , acting without the assistance of local facilitators			1
in recent days , @entity23 officials have embraced the possibility that @entity23 may have helped support the grisly attack			1
indeed , @entity23 will continue to confront an expanding array of internal foes			2
until recently , @entity23 has generally dismissed the importance of home - grown @entity49 militant groups and has focused instead upon the @entity24 - based groups			1
many within and without @entity23 have claimed that @entity23 's democratic institutions provide @entity53 and other marginalized social groups political means to redress their grievances			1
yet this narrative obscures the fact that many foreign terrorists have long relied upon @entity23 for logistical support , and disregards the increasing participation of @entity23 personnel in @entity23 's other recent attacks			1
persistent social inequity for @entity53 and other groups remains an important issue for the @entity23 state			1
@entity53 in @entity23 are less likely to be educated and employed in government service and more likely to be poor			1
they face episodic but large - scale violence			2
second , @entity23 will remain a target of @entity24 - based terrorism , and not only within its borders			1
the @entity23 @entity73 in @entity74 was attacked last summer with the involvement of the @entity24 government 's @entity76 ( @entity76 ) , according to @entity11 intelligence officials			1
@entity23 workers in @entity80 also have been killed by militants there			2
many @entity24 believe that the @entity82 should have awarded the muslim - majority state of @entity84 to @entity24 when it partitioned the subcontinent and withdrew from @entity6			0
instead , its local leadership decided to join @entity23			2
@entity24 has initiated three limited wars over @entity84 and has sustained a proxy war for nearly two decades			0
indeed , most of the @entity49 terrorist groups operating in and on behalf of " liberating " @entity84 were raised and directed by @entity24 's @entity76			0
yet the @entity11 government has only episodically insisted that @entity24 eliminate all militant groups operating in and from @entity24			0
rather , it first focused its attention on @entity95 and , in more recent years , the @entity96			0
no consistent message has been given about the militant groups that have largely set their sights on @entity84 and the @entity23 hinterland			2
yet these groups have tremendous ability to attack and destabilize the region , as underscored by the near - war that developed after the december 2001 attack upon the @entity23 parliament by @entity24 - based militants			1
the deaths of @entity11 in @entity14 may have focused the attention of the @entity11 public , but @entity40 has been targeting @entity11 and @entity113 forces in the @entity115 and @entity116 provinces of northeastern @entity80 for the last year			2
@entity24 's inability or unwillingness to eliminate all militant groups within its borders should have been viewed as an outrage before the @entity14 massacre			1
since 2002 , @entity24 has received some $ 12 billion from @entity125 , nearly half of it reimbursements for @entity24 's participation in the war on terror			0
yet the international community is paralyzed and unable to forge a comprehensive approach to compel @entity24 to eliminate militancy , fearing variously that pressure will alienate @entity24 , destabilize the fragile democracy or undermine @entity11 interests with a surge in nuclear proliferation			0
others suggest that @entity24 no longer controls the militant groups it spawned and note that @entity24 too is a victim of terrorism			0
third , @entity23 has not made adequate investments in its internal security infrastructure			2
it should reform its often corrupt and poorly trained and equipped police , expand their numbers and restructure their pay			0
@entity23 should also continue developing rapid - action counter-terrorism forces that are more dispersed across the country			1
it took some nine hours for @entity23 's well - trained @entity149 to reach @entity14 , in part because they had no dedicated aircraft for their movements			1
@entity14 and other coastal cities remain vulnerable to attack by sea			2
@entity23 has been battling dozens of insurgencies and terrorist campaigns since its emergence as an independent state in 1947 , yet it has failed to forge an appropriate strategy to deal with these challenges			2
@entity23 must improve social justice , provide better policing and law enforcement , harden targets where possible , and bolster intelligence capabilities and interagency coordination			0
the international community should deal forthrightly with @entity24			0
@entity24 should detain suspects , clamp down on the raft of militant groups in its territory and cooperate fully with @entity175			0
perhaps @entity176 may be a productive agency to use , since both states are members			0
even if @entity24 can not remand suspects to @entity23 for political reasons , it could try them in @entity24 courts , provided that @entity23 can provide evidence of their guilt			0
more than 10 days after the assault and under considerable international pressure , @entity24 has arrested activists associated with the organization			0
while this is an important step , @entity24 has not proscribed @entity40 ( now @entity190 ) , much less shut it down , and its leadership remains at large			0
even if these arrests temper @entity23 sentiments , they fall short of eliminating the group 's ability to operate			1
on all sides , the time for excuses is long past			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			0

@entity2 : @entity14 attacks show sources of *tension* in the region
she says signs point to potential for more violence after attacks
fair : inequality gives rise to grievances among @entity23 's @entity53 *population*
she says @entity23 is not well - prepared to *respond* to violent *upheaval*
