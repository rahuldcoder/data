-- dozens of whales are dead after they got stuck on a remote beach in @entity5 , authorities said monday			2
the 39 long - finned pilot whales became stranded overnight on @entity7 , a narrow claw of land that juts out into the sea from the northern tip of @entity5 's @entity12			1
twelve of the whales had died by the time they were found monday morning			2
conservation officials said they decided to euthanize the remaining 27 because the chances of getting them safely back out to sea were too slim			1
" they have come very high onto the beach in a big tide , " said @entity21 , the conservation services manager for the area where the whales were found			0
" the big tides are now reducing , coming in further out from shore , so it would be difficult to get the large animals into deep enough water to refloat them			0
" he said that he and his staff had " carefully weighed up the likelihood of being able to refloat " the whales , but that they " determined that due to various factors it was unlikely they could be rescued			0
" " rather than prolong the suffering of the remaining 27 whales , we decided to humanely euthanize them , " he said in a statement			0

@entity5 's worst ever stranding took place in 1918 , the @entity69 says , when around 1,000 pilot whales got marooned on @entity80 in the @entity81 , which are situated hundreds of kilometers off the country 's east coast			1
