among race horses , @entity0 is revered as one of the best of all time			1
his legacy was captured in the 2010 movie " secretariat , " which tells the story of the thoroughbred 's @entity9 victory			2
in 1973 , @entity0 won the @entity12 , @entity13 , and @entity14 , and set records that still stand today at the @entity12 and @entity14			1
but modern technology might make it possible for @entity0 's @entity13 time to be reviewed , and could possibly settle a controversy in racing history and give the horse a record time			1
@entity23 rallies to win 144th running of @entity14 the @entity25 will hold a hearing to consider evidence that @entity0 is indeed a @entity13 record - holder			1
the coulda , woulda , shoulda @entity9 winners @entity31 , who owned @entity0 , and @entity32 , the president of the @entity33 , made the request			1
the controversy over @entity0 's time goes back to the 1973 race day			1
the electronic timer at the @entity13 recorded a winning time of 1:55			2
however , two independent clockers from the @entity41 individually timed the race at 1:53 2/5			0
officials at the @entity44 , where the race is held , admitted that there were " extenuating circumstances " with the electronic timer 's recording , and changed @entity0 's official time to 1:54 2/5			2
animal welfare activists : horse racing industry needs reform if @entity0 had indeed ran the race in 1:53 2/5 , as the @entity41 timed it , it would have meant a record at the time , and one that has been matched , but not beaten since			1
" for me , revisiting this dispute on a new day is matter of resolution -- for historians , for sportswriters and for racing fans , " @entity31 said			0
" their voices are supported by sound evidence , and they deserve to be heard			0
" modern video technology can be used to settle the controversy , @entity32 said			0
" during the last 40 years , video technology has been accepted in other professional sports as a supportive mechanism for officials to ensure fairness and accuracy in their decisions , " he said			0
" it is important for horse racing and the record books to confirm the correct time in this historical race			2
it is the appropriate thing to do			0
" the commission will consider the request at a june 19 meeting			0
overheard on @entity83 : if wishes were horses , ' another ' secretariat would rise			0

@entity0 won the @entity9 in 1973
the race horse set records in two of the three races
a review of his time in the @entity13 could give him a record there , too
