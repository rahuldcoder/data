-- a day after the most high - profile assassination in @entity2 in more than seven years , accusations over who 's responsible homed in on the @entity6 regime of @entity7			1
prime minister @entity8 , a billionaire supported by @entity9 , announced saturday that he plans to stay in power , despite having offered his resignation to appease those who claimed @entity7 was behind friday 's car bombing that killed @entity2 's intelligence chief , @entity14			1
" to hold me personally responsible for the assassination is unfair , " he told reporters			0
" i have always respected and admired @entity15 , who has done great things for @entity2			2
" @entity8 's decision to stay heads off a power vacuum in @entity2 's government , as sectarian tensions flare particularly as the effects of @entity6 's 19 - month civil war spill across borders and threaten the region			1
do n't know who is who in @entity2 ? a guide to key players the senior @entity2 security official and at least nine others died in the explosion in the typically peaceful and cosmopolitan @entity37 district of @entity38			2
the attack -- in broad daylight , at one of the capital 's busiest intersections -- left a crater more than a meter deep and was just the kind of thing @entity15 had worked to prevent			0
but beyond its potential impact on @entity2 's security , @entity15 's life and death illustrates the deep political and religious fissures within @entity2 society , believed to be exacerbated by its neighbor 's internal conflict , where at least another 123 people were killed saturday amid fighting that has left tens of thousands dead			1
@entity57 , a @entity2 opposition leader and former prime minister , told @entity0 that he had no doubt that the @entity6 leader was responsible for friday 's deadly strike			1
@entity57 accused @entity7 of " killing his own people " and said " he will not think twice " about killing @entity2 in order to protect himself			1
" the message from @entity68 today is anywhere you are , if you are against the regime from @entity2 , we will come and get you			2
... no matter what you try to do , we will keep on assassinating the @entity2 , " said @entity57 , who blames the 2005 assassination of his father , former prime minister @entity72 , on the @entity7 government			1
@entity2 on edge after attack @entity6 armed forces opened fire from across the border on anti-al - @entity7 and anti-hezbollah protesters in northern @entity2 , the @entity2 state - run @entity78 reported			1
the protesters burned @entity7 's effigy and @entity9 flags before being fired upon , @entity78 reported , citing its reporters at the scene			1
@entity89 , a @entity90 politician and influential power broker in @entity2 's rough - and - tumble political landscape , also echoed @entity57 's comments			1
@entity89 told @entity0 he blames friday 's murder on the @entity7 government and has expressed concerns over his own safety			2
he said the @entity6 - backed murderers of @entity15 " can hit you any place anywhere			2
" " i do n't feel safe , " he added , talking to @entity0 in his hillside home outside the capital			0
when asked if he thought @entity15 's killers would be captured , @entity89 replied : " sometimes you have justice -- i mean procedural justice according to the rules , and sometimes you have natural justice when one day the killer will be killed			0
one day the killer will die			0
you just have to be patient and one day you will see your enemy floating in front of you in the river			0
" under @entity7 , @entity6 has continued to influence the politics of its smaller neighbor despite withdrawing troops from @entity2 in 2005 following @entity72 's assassination			1
last year , @entity68 maneuvered to topple @entity57 's son @entity117 as prime minister by persuading @entity89 to abandon the majority coalition in parliament , which left @entity9 to play kingmaker in protracted negotiations to form a new government			2
tensions have since boiled over in @entity2 following friday 's attack as enraged citizens blocked roads and clashes erupted in the port city of @entity130 between supporters and foes of @entity6 's government			1
the @entity2 president declared saturday a day of national mourning in decrying the " abominable crime " in a statement			0
but the prime minister 's failure to appear publicly after the explosion elicited criticism , including from one protester in @entity38 who said , " this government is killing us by not doing anything			0
it is not acting like a government			0
it is like a ghost government			0
" the @entity150 also weighed in friday , calling for " the perpetrators , organizers , financiers and sponsors of this crime " to be brought to justice			0
@entity0 's @entity157 contributed to this report from @entity38			0
