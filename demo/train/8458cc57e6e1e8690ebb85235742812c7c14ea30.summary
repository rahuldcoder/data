@entity0 -- as a career military officer , lt. gen. @entity2 is familiar with sacrifice for his country and long stretches away from home			1
@entity2 testifies before the @entity8 march 26			1
but he apparently does n't want any more separation from his wife , @entity11			0
if he is approved as the next @entity13 ambassador to @entity14 he wants her to come with him			1
that could collide with @entity18 rules			1
@entity14 is designated " an unaccompanied post " by the department because of the dangers of the war and terror attacks			2
that means family members are not allowed			0
sen. @entity26 , @entity27 , who as chairman of the @entity8 was running @entity2 's confirmation hearing last week , was in favor of the idea			1
" i know you are hoping to take your wife there with you , and i think i certainly , and i think the committee is entirely supportive , " @entity26 said			0
" i think it would be a terrific message and a strong boost of morale for the @entity40 , and obviously wherever possible we should try to encourage that			0
so i hope that will be facilitated			0
" said @entity2 , " mr. chairman , thank you very much for that support			2
" there was no immediate reaction from the @entity18 .			0

@entity2 awaits @entity8 confirmation to be next ambassador to @entity14
