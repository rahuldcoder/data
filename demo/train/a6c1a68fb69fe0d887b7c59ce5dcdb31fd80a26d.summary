every once in a while , people get all crazy about the idea that some people might " import " drugs from @entity6			1
many pharmaceuticals are much cheaper in that country and many @entity9 , especially those who live on the border , are sometimes tempted to buy their drugs there			1
inevitably , when this topic comes up for debate , someone questions the safety of those drugs			1
this concern is somewhat overblown			0
@entity6 is n't a banana republic , and it does a rather good job of ensuring the safety of its citizens without our help			1
moreover , it 's a concern that ignores that the vast , vast majority of drugs we buy here are not manufactured here			2
we import most of what we consume			2
for some reason , we do n't seem to be as concerned about the safety of our drugs here are home			1
it turns out , though , that we might need to rethink that , according to a recent story in the @entity39			0
for some time , many people , including me , have been advocating for greater use of generic and over-the - counter drugs over bioequivalent name brand drugs because they would result in significantly decreased health care spending			2
those arguments have resonated with the @entity9 people , and generic drug use has increased dramatically			1
in response , countries have massively increased their capacity to produce such drugs			2
for instance , about 40 % of all over-the - counter and generic drugs used in the @entity9 are produced in @entity56			1
in response to this and other factors , the @entity57 was passed in july of 2012			0
part of the law involved changes to generic drug user fees			0
companies looking for approval now need to pay some extra money to allow for better inspection of production facilities			0
and in @entity56 , those inspections are bearing fruit			1
last year , inspectors from the @entity73 looked at 160 drug plants there			0
what they found was often quite concerning			0
drugs were sometimes adulterated or contaminated			2
@entity78 were often filthy or infested with bugs			0
they also caught some executives lying to them , leading to felony charges			0
as you can imagine , this is leading many pharmaceutical companies to question whether @entity56 is a safe and reasonable place to manufacture their drugs			1
@entity56 's drug industry is in a panic			1
the @entity91 has , for years , monitored the use of falsified or counterfeit medicines , and some of the problems have been in the @entity9			1
the @entity39 documents many instances in many countries where improperly made or counterfeit drugs led to serious consequences , including deaths			2
many people have legitimate concerns about how much regulation goes into the approval of drugs in the @entity9			1
some believe the @entity73 is too cautious and makes it too difficult for people to get the medicines they want or need			2
but examples like this are a cautionary tale about how some regulation is necessary			0
without proper oversight , people in the @entity9 , not some @entity114 , are at risk for buying counterfeit drugs in their pharmacies			1
they are at risk not only for not getting the benefit they expect but also a negative consequence they did n't see coming			0
in many ways , you get what you pay for			0
companies have been using @entity56 for production largely because they have been able to do it so cheaply			1
but it 's becoming apparent that one of the reasons for those low costs may be because they were doing a much less - than - perfect job			0
fixing the problem will likely mean that they will lose their competitive advantage			2
if pharmaceutical companies move out of @entity56 , they will likely decide to go to other countries that can also offer cheap services			1
one of those is likely @entity143			1
but @entity143 , unlike @entity56 , has blocked @entity9 efforts to send @entity73 inspectors			1
we 're in a similar situation to what we had in @entity56 before the increased oversight			2
this is far from over			0
we need to be vigilant			0
we also need to support the government in its efforts to protect us overseas			1
fixing this problem , both now and in the future , will require resources and a firm stance			0
it may also require us to pay more for our drugs than we have in the past			0
that wo n't be popular , but sometimes good things cost money .			0

@entity164 : @entity9 worry about safety of buying cheaper drugs in @entity6
@entity164 : we import 40 % of our drugs from @entity56 ; contamination and fake pills are a problem
he says @entity56 allowed inspections ; @entity143 , which also makes drugs , *resists* them
@entity164 : we need to support the government in its efforts to protect us overseas
