@entity0 -- the oil market is caught in a pricing tug of war			1
it is clear emerging markets are beginning a slowdown which will likely cut demand for crude oil over the next year			1
the panic selling in equity markets from @entity11 to @entity12 , @entity13 to @entity14 is a leading indicator of what may be ahead in 2014			0
but at this juncture , the likelihood of military intervention in @entity27 , daily bombings and killings in @entity19 , and uncertainty about the flow of crude through @entity24 's @entity23 are far outweighing concerns about the developing world 's waning thirst for energy			1
energy traders acknowledge the return of the so - called @entity36 risk premium -- calculated to be $ 10 to $ 15 dollars a barrel			1
it is based on whether supplies might indeed be interrupted or , in the case of @entity19 after four months of intense bombings , production has fallen below market expectations			0
for a record three years running , @entity44 has averaged more than $ 100 barrel			1
as a result , the dozen members of @entity47 , dominated by the major producers of the @entity49 , earned one and a quarter trillion dollars in 2012			2
this was , in part , because of the cloud of uncertainty that hovers over the region			0

an escalation of violence triggered by military attacks on @entity27 is pushing crude well above what oil kingpin @entity66 believes is a fair price of $ 100			1
this fills the coffers of the six @entity49 , who in a @entity73 - environment are spending record amounts to fund economic development , create jobs and buy internal peace			2

this is what happened in the second half of that year , when prices fell to below $ 40			1
@entity89 's long - serving central bank chief , @entity88 , told me that many attempts are being made behind the scenes to return calm to the region			1
but when asked if there could be a further push on the upside for crude as a result of what is transpiring regionally , he said : " that could be true , and that would be beneficial for us because we still depend largely on oil prices for our budget revenues			1

it is now producing about 935,000 barrels a day , according to energy officials who spoke to me on background			0
the @entity116 's 2013 budget was built on oil projections of $ 85 a barrel , with energy making up 80 % of total revenues			1
the near $ 25 premium over @entity89 's projections will wipe out a planned budget deficit , officials told me			1
while regional oil producers may be swimming in additional funds , the higher prices will hit the economies which are running current account deficits and are subject to the capital flight we see today			1
watch more : @entity132 , @entity134 support action in @entity27 @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity135 top the list of the most vulnerable			2
with their currencies under severe pressure , there is the added danger of skyrocketing inflation due to higher imported energy costs			2
it may all sound a bit alarmist at this stage , with the mad dash of money out of emerging markets , but strategists suggest this is not the 1997 -- 1998 asian financial crisis all over again			0
watch more : @entity153 : @entity27 's chemical use unacceptable two years ago , countries such as @entity156 complained their currencies were overvalued and that in turn was undermining export growth			2
now we are in midst of the pendulum , and perhaps overshooting in the other direction			0
that may be today 's narrative in a climate of so much uncertainty , but policymakers and energy planners in the region say it is way too early to call an end to the long term trend of rising emerging market demand			0
@entity89 's central banker is one of those			0
" we think the growth momentum will continue in these countries and there will be demand for @entity89 oil , " @entity88 told me			0
the country is banking on it , with @entity184 and the government putting up to $ 20 billion into a new natural gas field			0
more tenders for additional exploration are in the pipeline , officials tell me			0
@entity89 , perched on the edge of the @entity192 , sees itself outside the region 's real danger zones , @entity27 , @entity19 and @entity24			2
but it is too early to suggest in this geo - political climate whether that will remain the case .			0
