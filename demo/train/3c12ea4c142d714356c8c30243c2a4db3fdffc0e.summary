-- it was supposed to be a formality , but the @entity3 was made to sweat against @entity4 before eventually overcoming the @entity6 's surprise package and booking a place in the semifinals saturday			1
substitute goalkeeper @entity9 was the hero , saving two penalties to secure a 4 - 3 shootout victory after this tense , nervous quarterfinal finished goalless			1
incredibly , the @entity14 man was brought on in the 29th minute of extra time with the sole job of denying " @entity4 " in the spot - kick showdown			1
it earned the @entity19 a second consecutive semifinals appearance , having lost to @entity21 in the title match four years ago			1
now the aim for @entity25 's men is to go one better than in @entity26			1
standing in their way of another final appearance will be @entity30 , which defeated @entity31 in the day 's earlier game thanks to a solitary early goal from @entity34			1
wednesday 's clash will be a repeat of the 1978 final , which @entity30 won 3 - 1 , and the dramatic 1998 quarterfinal in which the @entity19 triumphed thanks to a spectacular @entity41 winner			1
on the performances of both teams saturday , it will be difficult to pick a winner			2
@entity31 coach @entity46 described @entity30 as " ordinary " in his post-match press conference earlier in the day			1
likewise , there was little that was obviously special about the @entity19 against @entity4 -- but @entity51 's players have recorded some impressive results at this @entity6 so far			1
a thrilling 5 - 1 demolition of reigning world champion @entity21 was followed up with two closely fought victories over @entity56 and @entity57			1
the round of 16 , meanwhile , produced a dramatic late win over an impressive @entity61 side in the oppressive heat of @entity63			2
in @entity64 , @entity65 , the @entity3 was faced with another @entity67 opponent -- a @entity4 team which was only the fourth side from the @entity71 region to reach a @entity6 quarterfinal			1
solid defensive displays and tactical astuteness from its wily manager , @entity75 , had brought @entity4 this far			1
nobody expected them to get out out of a pool containing @entity80 , @entity81 and @entity82 , let alone as group winners			0
a heroic display with 10 men against @entity86 in the round of 16 , winning a shootout , ensured @entity75 's team would progress further than ever before			1
but in @entity51 , @entity75 had met his match			0
the @entity19 master , who will take over the reigns at @entity92 once the @entity6 is over , is one of the most celebrated @entity94 coaches of the last 30 years			1
throughout the tournament he has switched his style , tactics and personnel depending on the demands of the opponents			0
a rapid counter-attacking style was deployed against @entity21 to devastating effect while striker @entity103 was effectively utilized as a defender against @entity57 to stifle the @entity106 ' impressive forward line			0
here , @entity51 adopted a similarly prudent approach			0
both sides started cautiously , standing off and refraining from pressing until entering each other 's territory			2
whether this was down to a mark of respect or a pacing exercise in the @entity65 heat was unclear , but the @entity19 were the first to break the tentative rhythm			1
@entity117 was played through by @entity118 but @entity119 , who has performed admirably throughout the tournament , blocked low to his left before springing up to gather @entity123 follow - up			2
moments later @entity119 was at it again , saving low from @entity125 who had been set up by @entity127			0
@entity4 had its own chances , though they were less clear cut			1
a series crosses peppered @entity132 's goal but there was little to concern the men in orange until a flick from @entity137 bounced invitingly across goal with no @entity140 striker to tuck home			2
the @entity19 responded with a free kick from @entity143 that was spectacularly clawed away by @entity144 shortly after			1
after the break , both managers looked to break the stalemate by shuffling their pack			0
@entity149 replaced @entity150 up front for @entity4 while the @entity19 also made a striking change , taking off @entity125 for @entity153			1
then , just as it seemed the game would never break from a crawling pace , it burst into life			0
@entity158 , who @entity4 looked to double up on all night , burst forward and , despite accentuating what was minimal contact from @entity161 , won a free kick on the edge of the box			2
@entity143 stepped up and rattled the post with a vicious swerving shot before the ball was eventually cleared			0
all of a sudden , the @entity19 were energized and @entity4 were rocking			1
another free kick caused chaos in the @entity4 box and the ball dropped to @entity127 , who fired in a shot that @entity119 again did well to block			2
as the clock struck 90 minutes the @entity19 had their best chance of all as @entity174 's low cross evaded everyone until it landed at the feet of captain @entity127 at the back post			1
the @entity92 striker struck the ball goalwards with @entity144 stranded but his shot was met by the retreating , @entity182 who somehow used his body to deflect the ball onto the bar and away			0
after what was for so long a sterile contest , the brief break before extra time barely seemed enough for the now clearly tiring players to catch their breath			0
the @entity19 again started on the front foot as @entity144 made another fine save from a @entity195 header			2
from the resultant corner , the keeper was almost caught out as he flapped at @entity143 's cross			2
@entity199 was introduced at the break for defender @entity201 as @entity51 attempted to avoid the dreaded penalty shootout			1
the striker , whose injury - time penalty won the day against @entity61 , was soon booked for crashing into @entity144 when challenging for a high ball			2
@entity4 threatened next as substitute @entity149 broke free at the edge of the box , working a yard of space before firing a low shot that @entity132 dived to push away			2
even closer was to follow at the other end			0
as the clock ticked down , @entity143 peeled away at the far edge of the box before setting himself and unleashing another brilliant curling strike			0
for once @entity119 was helpless			0
but again the woodwork came to his rescue as the midfielder 's shot bounced away of the crossbar			2
penalties it would be -- but not before @entity51 took the unorthodox decision to replace @entity223 with @entity9 for the shootout			2
" there is no question about who will start next game , it will be @entity132 , " @entity51 said			0
" but we felt @entity9 was the better choice here			0
" we told @entity9 that he would be a possibility for the penalties , but we did n't tell @entity132 , as we did n't want to ruin his preparation			0
" it was a bold call that would prove decisive			0
@entity9 prowled around his area in an attempt to psyche out the @entity4 penalty takers , pointing to his eye to let them know he 'd done his homework			1
maybe he had , maybe he had n't			0
but his efforts to unnerve his opponents worked			0
@entity9 first dived low to his left to save from @entity244 and when @entity103 drilled the @entity3 ' fourth spot - kick home , @entity245 knew he had to score to keep his side in the competition			1
sadly for @entity245 and the tiny @entity250 nation of five million souls , he could n't , as @entity9 again went low to his left to push the spot - kick round the post and end the dream of these most valiant of underdogs			0
" we can not blame anyone because to be there at that time is not easy , " said @entity119 , who was named man of the match for the third time at @entity259 2014			0
" our rivals did their job in the penalty shootout and we did n't			1
" @entity75 admitted his team had been " lucky throughout the game " but expressed his great pride			0
" we are not a world football power but we have done very important things here , " the @entity269 said			0
" we go home proud of what we have done and i want to express my gratitude to the @entity276 people			0
