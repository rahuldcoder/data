-- a deadly shooting at a checkpoint at @entity3 emphasizes airport security vulnerabilities , according to analysts and a union chief			1
a gunman opened fire on friday at a @entity10 checkpoint at @entity3 , killing a @entity10 officer			1
the suspect was eventually shot and taken into custody , police said			2
the slain officer was the first @entity10 employee killed in the line of duty , according to @entity19 @entity18 , president of the @entity20 , a union that represents many @entity10 workers			1
the @entity10 's checkpoint officers are not law enforcement and are not armed			1
while friday 's tragedy was a first , " assaults of officers occur on a daily basis , " said @entity25 , in a telephone conference call			1
asked what could be done to improve security at the airport , @entity25 said he would like " our officers to be able to make arrests			2
that would be a big improvement if they had arrest power			2
" instead , they have to turn to local law enforcement when assaulted			0
even with the most highly trained @entity10 officers , some incidents ca n't be prevented , said @entity44 , director of terrorism , intelligence and security studies at @entity48			2
if security officials choose to focus on terrorism in a post- 9/11 world , " other threats to security may not be attended to as much as they should be , " he said			0
@entity44 suggested that training and better pay would go a long way in developing more sophisticated security			0
" are they paid as much as they should be , trained appropriately and recognized and rewarded for doing a good job ? " he asked			0
" do you want a highly paid security and intelligence officer or a rent - a - cop ? " @entity66 airports are not prepared for violence on the ground , said @entity69 , president of @entity71 - based @entity70			0
most of the measures taken since 9/11 are aimed at protecting aircraft from attack			0
" in the @entity66 , we do n't have vehicle checkpoints and we do n't have people watching who comes into the terminals and the presence of armed personnel is very , very thin , " said @entity69 , a former head of security of @entity77 near @entity78 , @entity79			0
vehicles driving into @entity77 must clear a vehicle checkpoint , and there are security personnel at all terminal entrances , he said			0
" it would be almost impossible to walk into the terminal with a gun			0
if he started shooting , he would probably be dead in a matter of seconds because of the heavy presence of security personnel			0
" the gunman on friday approached a checkpoint at @entity101 at 9:20 a.m. and began shooting at the @entity10 employee , according to an @entity104 officer who happened to be at the scene			1
the shooting was not the first at the airport			0
in 2002 , an @entity109 national killed two people and wounded four others at the ticket counter of @entity79 's @entity113 before a security guard shot and killed him			0
despite these violent incidents , unauthorized guns at the airport are often discovered in passenger carry - on bags as they pass through checkpoints			2
the @entity10 screens about 1.8 million passengers every day			1
the total number of guns seized by the @entity10 at airports around the country has been on the rise since 2007			1
the agency seized 1,556 guns in 2012 , nearly double the 803 guns confiscated in 2007 , according to agency figures			1
in 2013 , the agency seized 1,343 guns through the end of september , 13 of which were confiscated at @entity3			1
the @entity3 airport is the sixth busiest in the world based on total passengers ( 63.7 million in 2012 ) , according to @entity138 .			1
