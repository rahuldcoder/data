a celestial fireworks show peaks monday and tuesday as @entity2 passes though the dust of a comet 's tail			1
humans around the world have witnessed the @entity9 meteor shower every august for at least 2,000 years , with dozens of meteors streaking across the sky each hour			1
your view is best after midnight until just before sunrise			1
get away from city lights , if possible , for the full effect			0
a waning crescent moon means less light in the sky to compete with the meteor display			2
next year 's show will be dimmed by a full moon			2
the annual sky spectacular happens when our planet 's orbit around the sun passes near @entity29 's path , which goes by every 130 years			1
the last close encounter with the comet was 20 years ago , but it left grains of dust in its wake			0
the bright streaks you see are " interplanetary dust " burning up as it collides with our atmosphere at about 133,000 mph , according to @entity42 micrometeoroid expert @entity40			1
" the fragments are either remnants from the solar system 's formation , or they are produced by collisions between asteroids or comets from long ago			0
" " each such fragment is approximately the size of a dime , but the more constant , sporadic meteoroids have been around much longer , breaking down over time into tiny fragments only about as wide as a piece of human hair , " according to @entity42			2
while the meteor show is entertainment for most , it is a research opportunity for @entity60 and other @entity42 scientists			1
they 'll use radar systems around the globe to watch the fragments of sodium , silicon , calcium and magnesium enter the atmosphere			0
" the small meteoroids feed the atmosphere with all these extra materials , " @entity71 said in a @entity73 posting			0
" they come in , release metallic atoms that get deposited in the mesosphere and then get pushed around from pole to pole by the general global circulation			0
so by using the metals as tracers , you can answer some important questions about the general composition and movement of the atmosphere			0
