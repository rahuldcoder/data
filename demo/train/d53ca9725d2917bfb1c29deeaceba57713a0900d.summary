-- @entity1 wants a second life -- one away from tennis			1
after calling time on an illustrious playing career with two grand slams safely tucked away , the @entity5 is arguably just as entrenched in the game as she ever was			1
@entity1 is currently juggling roles as tournament director in @entity11 and captain of @entity5 's @entity14 team , alongside coaching and commentating stints			1
but the 34 - year knows there will come a time when she walks away from the court once and for all , hopefully in the direction of her own vineyard			1
" to be lucky enough to have lived one passion -- tennis -- is great but to learn many things and meet new people in a completely different area , atmosphere and world , why not ? " she tells @entity0 's @entity30			1
" i have a high passion that is wine ; i am a wine lover , i have a big wine cellar			2
" i read a lot of things about wine from around the world and different regions in @entity5			1
i check sometimes with friends of mine about the wine chateaus that are for sale			0
" a world away from the tranquil vines associated with @entity5 's verdant valleys is the slog of the professional tennis circuit -- @entity1 's home for well over a decade			1
as well as clinching those two major championships in 2006 -- the @entity53 and @entity54 crowns -- she attained the coveted world no. 1 spot on several occasions and won a silver medal the @entity58			2
but when injuries began to mount in 2009 and @entity1 took the decision to quit the court , a whole new world presented itself to her			1
" it was the pressure , " she explains			0
" the pressure that came out of my shoulders was huge			0
i was finally able to live a normal life , let 's say , to enjoy the things that i could not enjoy before			2
" i also felt that i achieved as a tennis player everything that i could have done , so i think it made it quite easy for me to take the step out of it and to do other things			0
" honestly i was scared			0
( i thought ) ' what am i going to do ? is it going to be exciting enough ? how exactly is it going to be ? ' " you are going into something and you have no clue what it is ... and i am really happy , i do n't regret anything			0
" fast forward five years and @entity1 is still intrinsically linked with tennis			1
in 2011 she was named tournament director of the @entity85 in @entity11 , a competition she won three times as a player , before accepting the role of captain of @entity5 's national women 's team in july 2012			1
@entity1 has a special place in her heart for the @entity14 -- the female equivalent of the @entity95 -- having won it in 2003 , triumphing in all eight of her singles rubbers			1
@entity97 , one of those involved in @entity5 's @entity99 win over @entity101 last month , says @entity1 is the best captain she has ever played for			1
she has also had success in her short coaching career , helping propel @entity104 to the 2013 @entity54 title before her compatriot 's shock decision to quit the sport			2
with 25 career singles titles to her name , and over $ 15 million accrued in prize money , @entity1 's name was , and still is , indelibly marked into the fabric of the women 's game			1
" @entity117 was all my life for 20 years , " she says			2
" i owe so much to tennis as a person also because i really grew up and learned many things , i was talking earlier about the relationships with people and the strong connections that you get			0
" i love that also to go on this journey but not alone -- really having people next to me , beside me , guiding me , learning from them , listening to them and giving them some things -- the exchange and the connection you have is quite interesting			0
" and on the sports side you develop the competitiveness that you have inside of you , you really let it out			0
it 's an obsessive thing to be a professional athlete , it 's something you think about all the time			0
" it 's everything you do , how you eat , how you sleep , what time you go to bed , the activities you do outside			0
it 's all related with your tennis and it 's something that is really taking all your life , and i also enjoyed it			1
" it was a relief when it stopped but throughout your career it was really fulfilling you , and it 's quite interesting			0
" given the knowledge and experience she has , tennis will miss @entity1 when she departs			2
and when she does , what memory from her playing days will she treasure most ? " @entity54 in 2006 , " she replies , recalling a final in which she rallied from a set down to beat @entity154 -- who had denied her @entity156 gold in @entity157 -- and become the first @entity5 to win the prestigious title since @entity159 in 1925			0
" it was really the emotion , the exhilaration the relief , being so proud of what i did , " @entity1 adds			0
" it was a feeling you really keep in yourself , you are not thinking about it every day in your life but it 's something that belongs to you and you cherish			0
" getting a medal in the @entity156 is huge , winning the @entity14 for my country , being number one in the world also is an amazing achievement , all those things but yes i would put @entity54 on top			2

@entity1 is still *immersed* in world of tennis four years after *retirement*
@entity5 won two grand slam titles in a 15 - year professional career
she now is @entity5 's @entity14 captain and is a tournament director in @entity11
@entity1 hopes to have second life away from tennis , *indulging* her passion for wine
