@entity0 , @entity1 -- at the bus terminal in downtown @entity0 , they 're easy to spot			1
dressed in blue jeans , they carry boxes , bags or large envelopes with their name and a number on it			2
they are ex-offenders , just released from @entity1 's prison system			1
when they step off the bus with $ 200 in " gate money " in their pockets , many have hopes of making a fresh start			1
but in this seedy area just blocks from @entity21 , the new arrivals are easy targets for pimps and drug dealers			1
for some , the temptation is too much			2
while not everyone succumbs to the streets so quickly , nearly 60 percent return to prison within three years , according to @entity1 's @entity31			1
it 's a cycle that @entity33 is striving to break through her reentry program			1
having served six prison terms for drug offenses in the 1980s and ' 90s , @entity35 knows from experience how hard it can be			1
" every time i was released , i swore i was n't going back , " said @entity35 , 57			1
" but i know now that without the resources and support , it 's next to impossible			2
... if you do n't have a new door to walk through , the only thing is the old door			2
" do you know a hero ? nominations are open for 2010 @entity51 a new door is what @entity35 's program -- a new way of @entity56 -- gives to just - released female offenders			1
by providing a sober place to live and other support services , she 's helped more than 400 women get back on their feet			1
@entity35 was raised in the projects in @entity64 , and her own life took a turn for the worse when her 5 - year - old son was accidentally hit and killed by a car in 1981			2
amid her grief , she started smoking crack cocaine and ended up in prison -- beginning a pattern of addiction and incarceration that continued for years			1
" i could n't get off the turnstile , " @entity35 said			2
" i knew i had a problem but did n't understand the complexity			2
" @entity35 ultimately got clean at a rehab facility in 1997 and realized she wanted to help other women offenders when they were released			1
she worked as a live - in caregiver and saved up enough money to buy a house in @entity86			0
she put bunk beds in the bedrooms , converted the breakfast nook into a bedroom / office for herself , and at the end of 1998 , she opened her doors			0
right away , her program took off			1
" @entity94 happened , " she said			0
" there were 10 women in the house , just working together , helping each other , recovering together			0
" today , @entity35 -- now a certified dependency counselor -- has five houses and supports up to 22 women at a time , largely with funding from a variety of private foundations			0
she receives 20 to 30 letters a week from inmates and answers each one , promising them a place to stay			1
@entity35 personally picks up most new arrivals at the bus station or at the prison gates , greeting them with a simple " welcome home			1
" " to me , there 's this real window of opportunity to get people from incarceration into a positive lifestyle , " she said			0
she and her group provide food , clothing and transportation , along with helping them register for benefits , get id cards so they can find work and begin regaining custody of their children			0
in return , @entity35 asks that residents stay clean , attend 12 - step meetings , and enroll in school , get drug treatment or find work			1
she also asks them to contribute $ 500 a month when they can , but says she wo n't turn anyone out as long as they 're making progress			0
when the women are ready to live independently , @entity35 finds them housing and helps furnish their homes			0
it 's a formula that seems to achieve results			0
according to @entity35 , 75 percent of women who enter the program stay clean and do n't return to prison for at least 18 months			1
@entity151 is just one of @entity35 's many success stories			0
" when i came here ... the only thing i knew to look for next was a hit , " said @entity151 , 50 , who struggled with addiction and homelessness for 15 years			0
but in the 18 months since she entered @entity35 's program , she 's stayed sober , taken computer classes and is now looking for a job and her own place to live			1
" today , i am not that same person that i was , " @entity151 says			0
" miss @entity33 made me want to change my life			1
" @entity35 's program may be needed even more in the future			2
in august 2009 , federal judges ruled that @entity1 's prisons were overcrowded and ordered a release of 40,000 inmates over the next two years			0
the state is appealing , but it seems likely that more prisoners will be released , at a time when state - funded rehabilitation programs for inmates are being cut			0
@entity35 worries about how inmates will deal with these new challenges and said she is constantly looking for new ways to help ex-offenders succeed			0
she runs a clinic with @entity183 's law school that helps expunge people 's records so they can find work more easily and encourages all of her residents to become politically active			0
" i want the women to realize that ... they have something to contribute , " she said			0
for @entity35 , her hard work " is giving life , hope , courage to people to give back to the world , " she said			2
" i just wanted my life to count towards something good , and this was the way i could do it			0
" want to get involved ? check out the @entity205 web site and see how to help .			0
