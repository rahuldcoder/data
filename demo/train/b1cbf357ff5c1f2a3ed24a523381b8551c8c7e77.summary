-- whatever the outcome of the @entity4 case , it will be viewed less as a determination of the shooter 's guilt or innocence and more as a victory or loss for civil rights , @entity13 's lawyer fears			1
@entity14 said he has been busy trying to dispel the racial overtones in the case by getting out more evidence about his client			2
his hope , he said , is that people will divorce a verdict from the real civil rights questions			1
the civil rights issue " the more people that consider an acquittal of @entity13 to be a loss for civil rights , the worse for civil rights , " he told @entity0 's @entity25			1
a year ago , @entity13 , who is @entity32 , shot @entity4 , an @entity33 teenager returning home after walking to a convenience store for a drink and a snack			1
public documents pertaining to the case @entity13 said he acted in self - defense			2
prosecutors say he ignored a police dispatcher 's advice and was guilty of racial profiling			0
the case drew national attention because police did not bring charges against @entity13 for more than a month after the shooting , saying the circumstances required further investigation			0
' absolutely no racism ' @entity14 said the evidence will show that @entity13 was n't profiling			1
he said the @entity54 investigated the shooting and found " absolutely no racism			1
" " as a matter of fact , they found a lot of events and instances where @entity13 was what you might call an absolute nonracist , " @entity14 said			1
on february 26 , 2012 , @entity4 was walking back to the @entity66 , @entity67 , apartment of his father 's fiancee after picking up some @entity70 and an iced tea at @entity72			2
that 's when @entity13 , then a 28 - year - old neighborhood watch volunteer , spotted him walking through the complex			2
what happened between then and when @entity13 fatally shot the teen is subject to dispute , one that could be settled by a jury starting june 10 , when @entity13 is set to go on trial on a second - degree murder charge			1
one night , two stories the jury will have to decide between two starkly different versions of what happened that night			0
@entity13 told police that the two exchanged words and @entity4 went after him			1
according to his account , the teen -- who was unarmed -- punched him , forced him to the ground , and slammed his head on a sidewalk			0
letters to @entity13 show split opinions @entity13 then shot @entity4 in self - defense , he claims			1
@entity4 's family and supporters , though , have long had a different story			2
one of the first to tell it was his father , @entity101 , who initially addressed reporters last march 8 , trying to raise the case 's profile and hike pressure on authorities			0
he and , soon , others suggested @entity13 had targeted his son , an @entity33 youth wearing a hooded sweatshirt , because of his race			0
a year later during a vigil in @entity112 on tuesday night to mark the first anniversary of his son 's death , @entity101 pledged to continue the fight for justice			0
" this is the one year anniversary of his death			0
it 's a somber day for us , but its also a day of peace for us , because we know as parents we 've done all that we can do to make our children 's lives right , " he said			0
" the wounds have not been healed , but we 're working on healing the wounds			0
" parents ready to let jury decide fate of son 's killer up to the jury @entity14 indicated at trial he will dissect the recording of @entity13 's 911 call and point to evidence of the wounds @entity13 said he suffered that night			1
" i believe , you know , again , the evidence is what it is and that 's for a jury to determine , " @entity14 said			1
" but a close reading or looking at that tape and all the evidence that followed , particularly @entity13 's injuries and @entity4 's lack of injuries but for the fatal gunshot , suggest that @entity13 did not begin the fight , did not continue the fight and actually was the victim of the attack rather than the other way around			1
" but a lawyer for the @entity161 said the fight against " senseless gun violence " will continue			0
" he went home and slept in his bed the night he killed @entity4 , " attorney @entity164 said			0
" and that was n't equal justice			0
" @entity164 then led a chant of " hoodies up ! hoodies up ! " at the vigil			0
