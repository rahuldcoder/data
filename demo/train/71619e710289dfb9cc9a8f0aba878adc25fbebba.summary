a passenger on @entity4 was found wearing an oxygen mask when the victim 's body was recovered in eastern @entity8 , the @entity1 foreign minister and public prosecutor 's office said			1
" they did not see the missile coming ; but you know that someone was found with an oxygen mask over ( his or her ) mouth ? so ( he or she ) had time to do that , " foreign minister @entity16 told the @entity1 talk show " @entity17 " on wednesday			1
the @entity1 public prosecutor confirmed the minister 's account , saying that " during the identification process an oxygen mask was indeed found on a victim			1
" " the mask was attached around the victim 's neck with an elastic strap			2
the @entity34 examined the mask for fingerprints , saliva and dna , but the results were inconclusive , " the prosecutor 's office said in a statement thursday			0
" it is not known how and at what point the mask came to be around the victim 's neck			0
the passenger 's relatives were informed at the time			0
none of the other victims recovered were found to be wearing oxygen masks			2
" new information raises questions the statements raise questions about what happened in the moments after the @entity55 was allegedly hit by a missile over eastern @entity8 july 17 , in an area controlled by @entity59 separatists			1
the fact that a passenger was able to put on an oxygen mask seems to dispel the idea that all 298 people on board were killed instantly in the air			1
the @entity67 and @entity8 accused @entity59 separatists operating in the region of downing the plane with a missile , a charge the rebels denied			1
a preliminary report by the @entity75 last month supported that theory , saying the plane was hit by " high - energy objects , " but it did not cast blame			1
about two - thirds of those who died in the incident were @entity1			2
the plane was flying from @entity84 to @entity85 , @entity4			0
' i should not have said it ' @entity89 's remarks appear to have been off - the - cuff			0
on thursday , he said that he regretted revealing the information about the oxygen mask , because not all the victims ' relatives had yet been informed			1
" i should not have said it , " he said in a statement released by the foreign ministry			0
" i feel enormously for the next of kin			0
the last thing i want is to in any way worsen their suffering			0
" the foreign ministry said the government had previously informed the family of the victim who was wearing the mask , but had not distributed the information further because " no conclusion " could be drawn from the fact that the victim was wearing a mask , and " more research is needed			2
" the victim was not of @entity1 nationality , the foreign ministry said , but it did not specify where the victim was from			2
all next of kin have now been informed .			0
