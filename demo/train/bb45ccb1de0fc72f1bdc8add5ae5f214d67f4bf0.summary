-- when @entity4 was named the @entity6 's rookie of the year in 2010 , the groundswell of opinion outside the @entity3 was that the award should have gone to another young golfing prodigy -- @entity9			1
while the @entity10 went on to win his first major title in 2011 , and climbed to the top of the world rankings this year , @entity4 had been hanging on the cusp of his own breakthrough			1
until sunday , that is , when the 23 - year - old claimed his first @entity6 title at the same @entity19 venue where @entity9 made his mark two years ago with a stunning final - round 62 that secured his maiden @entity3 victory			1
clad in his trademark bright orange outfit , his shock of hair barely contained by his hat , and a mustache nestling above his top lip that any 1970s detective would be proud of , @entity4 produced his own moment of magic to beat @entity9 and fellow @entity3 @entity33 in a playoff at the @entity35			1
@entity36 misses halfway cut at @entity19 his stunning wedge shot to within four feet of the hole at the tricky 18th , which had given up only four birdies all day , earned him the $ 1.17 million first prize and lifted him to 15th in the @entity45 standings and 24th in the world rankings			1
" for @entity4 to go out and play that hole the way he did , he deserved to win , " said @entity9 , who returned to world no. 1 above @entity49 @entity48 after taking home $ 572,000 in consolation			1
" he probably has gone through a little bit of sort of scrutiny and a lot of pressure trying to get that first win , but now that win is out of the way			0
hopefully that 'll ease the pressure a little bit			0
" @entity4 , who was the world 's top amateur for 36 weeks , lost a playoff in his second tournament as a professional and has been runner - up three times on the main @entity3 tour			1
@entity71 returns to @entity6 " it 's nice to kind of shut them up a little bit , " he said on the @entity6 website			2
" it 's going to be kind of a relief			0
it 's been a wait , but i 'm definitely still young , and hopefully this opens the door to many more			0
but it 's nice to be mentioned as a @entity6 winner			0
" it 's still going to be almost like having zero when someone like @entity86 ( @entity87 ) is getting announced with 40 and i 've got one			0
i 've got some work to do			0
" when @entity4 lines up at this week 's prestigious @entity90 , he will again be playing without one of his closest golfing friends -- masters champion @entity93 , who skipped @entity19 to be with his wife and newly - adopted son and has also decided to sit out golf 's " fifth major			1
" final leaderboard at @entity35 @entity93 and @entity4 make up half of golf 's only boy band , the @entity100 , along with @entity102 and @entity45 leader @entity103			1
" i 'm bummed that @entity93 was n't around , " said @entity4 , who helped @entity93 celebrate after his @entity105 playoff victory in april			1
" we were n't exactly inside the ropes but we had a front - row seat , and just to see how he handled himself , the shots he hit , just to feel the energy ... definitely being around there gave me the kind of want to win more			0
" it 's not the first time @entity4 has beaten @entity9 -- he did so by six shots in his only other professional win in a @entity120 event last year			2
" @entity9 is the top - ranked young player right now , i 'm probably the one that sticks out most with color , " @entity4 said			2
" now i 'm a @entity6 winner , so i 've got some credibility			0
" @entity4 played in the @entity125 defeat against @entity126 , and sunday 's victory has lifted his hopes of playing in the @entity3 team for this year 's match in @entity131 , @entity132			2
meanwhile , another player who made his @entity135 debut two years ago , @entity133 , boosted his chance of a second appearance in september by winning the @entity139 's @entity138 on sunday			0
the @entity140 , whose brother @entity141 halved with @entity4 in singles play at @entity144 in 2010 , moved up to 10th place on the @entity147 standings after winning by three shots in @entity149			2
the 29 - year - old took home â ‚ ¬ 333,330 ( $ 435,000 ) after clinching his first title in 18 months , and climbed to 29th in the world rankings .			0

@entity4 wins his first @entity6 title in playoff at @entity35
he beats @entity9 and fellow @entity3 @entity33 to $ 1.17 million prize
@entity9 , who returns to world no. 1 , won the tournament for his first @entity6 title in 2010
@entity4 wishes his friend @entity93 had been there to share the celebrations
