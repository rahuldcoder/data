@entity0 -- although president - elect @entity3 will become the next commander - in - chief in just two weeks , several key issues remain to be resolved regarding the drawdown of @entity7 troops in @entity8 and the buildup of @entity7 forces in @entity11			1

a closed - door meeting monday at the @entity17 with the @entity18 and gen. @entity19 -- who is in charge of the @entity8 and @entity11 wars -- ended with no consensus on troop plans for either country , several top @entity7 military officials told @entity1			1
the officials , who did not want to be identified because the meeting was private , all offered @entity1 similar accounts of the discussions			2
in addition , a review of the @entity11 war strategy being conducted by @entity18 chairman adm. @entity33 is also incomplete and has not been approved by the @entity18			1
that review , according to one official , will not be finished until the @entity3 administration is in office			2
the monday meeting was polite , one official said , but also interesting and intense			0
a second official described the discussion as lively and said it ranged further than originally anticipated			0
the session was held in the " tank , " a secure meeting room inside the @entity17 reserved for some of the most sensitive and classified conversations by top officials			0
it was called to discuss yet again how the drawdown of troops in @entity8 could be scheduled so that more troops could be sent to @entity11 -- an issue that the chiefs have struggled to resolve for months			1
according to the officials , a 10 - page plan from the @entity55 calls for a very gradual drawdown between now and the end of 2011 , when all @entity7 troops are supposed to be out of @entity8 under the terms of a recent agreement between the two countries			1
but @entity19 and other top @entity7 commanders in @entity8 are reluctant to agree to any specific drawdowns of units more than six months ahead of time because of the uncertain security situation and the upcoming elections in @entity8 , according to a second official			1
" the real debate is over the timing and risk of drawing down troops in @entity8 , " the second official said			0
that decision is considered a vital first step			0
military officials have long said the @entity17 needs to have some assurance of drawdowns over the next year in order to free up enough troops to send more units to @entity11 , where commanders are asking for up to 30,000 additional troops			2
the @entity83 is continuing to press its position that several thousand @entity83 could be withdrawn from @entity8 in the coming months , with their replacements going to @entity11 instead			2
the current calculation is that the full complement of troops for @entity11 could not be completely sent until sometime next year or in 2011			0
some commanders in @entity11 say that 's too late , given the deteriorating security situation there			0
once in office , @entity3 is expected to ask commanders to develop a plan for a 16 - month drawdown , as he promised during his campaign for the @entity98			1
it 's not clear if the @entity18 and @entity19 will recommend that there is unacceptable risk in the quicker drawdown option			1
the second official also emphasized that even though @entity0 and @entity104 have agreed that all @entity7 troops would leave @entity8 by 2011 , there is a general private understanding by both sides that some @entity7 troops could remain there or in neighboring @entity109 to provide help in key areas such as training , securing borders and providing airlift capabilities			0
@entity3 has also said he wants a residual force to remain in @entity8 .			2
