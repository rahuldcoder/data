the burly @entity4 ceo , who announced friday that he will retire next year , has been the victim of some unfortunate timing			1
when he took over leadership of @entity4 in 2000 @entity1 had to follow iconic co-founder @entity7 , who had built the software titan into the most valuable company in the world			1
then @entity1 was blindsided by the swift rise of @entity12 and @entity13 , whose @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16 led a mobile revolution and made @entity4 appear slow and out of touch			1
on a more positive note , @entity1 has been credited more recently for re-imagining the company 's core product with the bold @entity23 operating system and leading a 2013 revival of @entity4 's once - flagging stock			1
under his reign , @entity4 has a mixed record of success with its consumer products			1
here 's a look at some of the company 's more notable hits and misses of the @entity1 era			1
hits @entity37 -- this version of @entity4 's desktop operating system was released in 2001 and used on more than 80 % of pcs at its peak			2
the software also showed surprising staying power : many it managers , frustrated by the buggy @entity46 , downgraded to the older but more reliable xp			0
today , 12 years after its launch , @entity37 still runs almost 39 % of the world 's desktop computers			0
xbox -- launched in 2001 , the venerable video gaming console and its successor , the @entity53 , have sold more than 100 million units			0
some blockbuster games , such as the " @entity56 " and " @entity57 " series , are available only for the @entity50			0
its kinect system was hailed as a step forward in motion - control gaming , while @entity63 , @entity4 's online multiplayer gaming network , now has more than 46 million members worldwide			1
@entity4 will release its next - generation console , the @entity66 , in november			1
@entity67 -- @entity1 in 2009 introduced @entity4 's @entity67 search engine , which drew praise for its attractive visuals and predictive - text features that produced search suggestions before users were done typing queries			1
it wo n't challenge @entity76 's dominance any time soon , but @entity67 has emerged as a credible rival			0
it has gradually increased in popularity and now commands almost 18 % of the @entity80 search engine market			0
@entity81 ( and 7.5 ) -- with this launch in late 2010 and early 2011 , @entity4 completely rebuilt its mobile operating system from the ground up by adding a more intuitive interface , better social - networking tools and a high - def screen with colorful " live tiles			2
" it was a radical move for a company that for years had been playing it safe			0
misses internet explorer 6 -- this version of @entity4 's widely used desktop browser was roundly criticized for its security flaws and lack of support for modern web standards			2
@entity99 -- in 2006 , @entity4 finally launched its answer to @entity13 's hot - selling @entity14			1
but the clunky @entity99 line of portable media players never caught on , and by late 2009 their market share had dropped to 2 %			0
it did n't help that at midnight on december 31 , 2008 , all of @entity99 's 30gb models froze up for a day -- a problem with the way the device 's internal clock recognized ( or did n't recognize ) leap years			2
@entity4 put the @entity99 out of its misery in 2011			1
vista -- released in 2007 , this successor to @entity37 was an immediate dud			0
critics complained about its cost , sluggish speed , restrictive licensing terms and how @entity46 aimed to discourage the copying of protected digital media			0
one survey of corporate users found only 8 % said they were " very satisfied " with the operating system			0
stung by the reaction , @entity4 rushed out @entity128 7 less than three years later			0
surface tablets -- again , @entity4 found itself chasing @entity13 , this time with a belated attempt to dethrone the market - leading ipad			2
launched in october 2012 -- more than two years after the original @entity16 -- the surface tablet was @entity4 's first attempt to integrate its new @entity23 operating system with its own hardware			2
despite some good reviews , the @entity136 has n't clicked with consumers			0
@entity4 earned only $ 853 million from the surface between its launch last fall and the close of the company 's fiscal year -- a small fraction of @entity16 sales revenue during that time			2
said @entity146 , " that 's a particularly sad showing for the tablet , given the blustering smack - talk with which @entity4 launched the device			1

@entity4 ceo @entity1 announced friday that he will step down in the next 12 *months*
under @entity1 's reign , @entity4 has had a mixed record of success with its products
the xbox console has been a *consistent* seller , while the now - *defunct* @entity99 music player was a dud
