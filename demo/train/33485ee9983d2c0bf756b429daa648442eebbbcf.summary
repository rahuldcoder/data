@entity0 -- @entity2 and @entity3 wasted little time rushing to the cameras when the @entity5 narrowly upheld the president 's sweeping health care reform law			1
their remarks after the june ruling were a contrast of competing rhetoric over a contentious piece of legislation , and a prism into how each candidate hopes to quietly change the makeup of the federal courts			1
" @entity22 are probably paying much more attention to the economy than the @entity5 , " said @entity19 , a top appellate attorney and @entity21 publisher			2
" but they should be thinking about presidential court appointments , because they 'll make a big difference in the future of the law			1
you think about things like same - sex marriage , affirmative action , voting rights -- all of these are issues that have very different ideological components to them , and the more conservative justices definitely have a different view , " he said			1
but the landmark health care ruling had exactly zero impact on the presidential race at the time as a @entity1 / @entity45 poll just days later showed virtually no change in opinions on public attitudes toward @entity2 or @entity3			1
it is an unusual dynamic : the @entity5 traditionally rates near the bottom when voters are asked to list the issues most important to them , but the high - profile issues the justices decide -- hot - button topics like health care , abortion , economic and tax reforms -- remain of consistent concern to the electorate			1
@entity62 : why are candidates silent on @entity5 ? the high court is poised to maintain a period of bench stability for at least a couple more years , barring an unexpected illness or personal crisis			1
this , after four court vacancies from 2005 - 2010 brought on chief justice @entity72 and justices @entity73 , @entity75 , and @entity76			1
still , many court watchers anticipate the man sitting in the @entity79 through 2016 could name at least one and perhaps as many as three members to the @entity5			1
and the recent health care decision may have raised the already high stakes on the makeup of the federal bench at large			1
big cases await @entity5 's 2012 - 13 term " even more @entity22 are watching who is on the @entity5 this election cycle , more so perhaps they have in the past , because there 's a clear connection between who is on the court and how that affects your daily life , " said @entity88 , chief counsel of the @entity89			1
" the @entity5 and its ideological divide is really placing the @entity99 and the country in many ways at a crossroads			0
" judicial philosophy @entity2 has touted his successful nominations of @entity75 and @entity76 , saying they fit his overall philosophy of what a good judge should be			0
he has been criticized in the past for using " empathy " as a key criterion to nominate judges			1
@entity5 possibilities if @entity2 is reelected " i think that 's why he 's backed off from talking about it , because ultimately the ' empathy ' standard turns a court more into identity politics , " said @entity114 , chief counsel of the @entity115 , a conservative legal advocacy group			2
" ultimately , that 's actually not what @entity22 want			0
we do n't want judges that are going to vote their interest group			0
we want judges who are going to vote with the @entity99 : what they think is the correct legal and constitutional result			0
and that is what governor @entity3 has been emphasizing , " @entity131 said			0
the president 's has not talked much about the high court this election year , but he has had an uneasy relationship with its conservative majority			1
@entity3 has said , if elected , he would " nominate judges in the mold of chief justice [ @entity72 ] @entity72			0
" but @entity3 told @entity142 this past summer that @entity72 made " political considerations " in authoring the health care ruling			1
the @entity146 nominee supplemented his thoughts on the kinds of judges he would appoint : " i 'd look for individuals who have the intelligence and believe in following the @entity99			0
" @entity5 possibilities if @entity3 is elected @entity88 said the decision on health care " was sort of a microcosm of the philosophies that are frankly at a crossroads " at the court			1
" and if president @entity2 gets to nominate one or more justices in his next term , that could solidify the approach of the majority in the @entity164 , which gives the national government the power to solve national problems			2
" unofficial favorites a dynamic @entity170 politician and a low - key @entity0 lawyer have emerged as unofficial favorites for any high court vacancy in the next four years			1
@entity1 talked with nearly a dozen sources close to both the @entity3 and @entity2 campaigns			0
for the president 's backers , one name is repeatedly mentioned : @entity179 , the @entity180 's elected attorney general			2
at 48 , the part @entity184 , part @entity182 woman has been praised for her political savvy , ethnic background , telegenic personality , law enforcement credentials , and early support of @entity2 's 2008 candidacy			0
@entity191 : why @entity192 are key to election " if @entity200 [ @entity199 ] @entity198 does retire , or president @entity2 gets another appointment , i do think @entity179 is the most likely to be put on , " said @entity19 , who generated buzz when he analyzed @entity195 at length eight months ago in his well - respected legal blog			1
" the @entity170 attorney general has the most political experience , which is really missing on the court right now			1
she 's diverse , she 's young -- i think kind of a female @entity2 in some sense			0
" @entity195 declined to speculate about a possible move to @entity0			1
for @entity3 , his legal advisers point to @entity208 , the former @entity22 solicitor general , as the kind of reliable , articulate conservative justice they think the @entity146 nominee would like			0
despite no judicial experience , the quietly self - assured 46 - year - old @entity213 native has earned praise as a dazzling attorney arguing a range of big cases before the high court -- including health care and immigration reform			1
some conservative legal advocates want more assurances of @entity208 's conservative bona fides , hoping he and other young @entity146 lawyers would first be named to a federal appeals court seat -- a stepping stone perhaps to the high court			2
" clearly he 's a brilliant man			0
he 's clearly a wonderful [ oral ] advocate , " said @entity131			0
" but i think particularly for a @entity5 spot , you 're going to want to see somebody who has judicial experience , to see how they actually perform as a judge			0
... but certainly , i could see him being in a lower court position so that he would have the chance to build that experience and that record and then be in a place further down the line when another opening comes up			2
" @entity208 was modest about the speculation			0
" i think service on the bench is a great form of public service ; i would n't want to necessarily rule it out , " he told @entity1 exclusively in march			0
" on the other hand , i 'm a big believer in that you sort of have to do the job that you currently have and you ca n't really worry about what you might do next			0
" a number of other potential top @entity3 picks are already relatively young federal judges , thanks to a deep conservative bench named by president @entity258 , who made those judicial choices a top priority			2
next to retire as for which justice would be next to retire , that remains one of the last best - kept secrets			2
@entity198 , who turns 80 next march , is the oldest , and has previous health problems			2
but she has publicly stated her desire to stay on the court for a few more years if possible			2
if @entity2 is re-elected and if @entity198 were to step down , the balance on the power on the court would likely not shift : the president would ostensibly be replacing one liberal with another			1
conservative justices @entity273 and @entity275 are both 76 , and their nominated replacements would be more closely scrutinized and debated , especially if @entity2 were to be the one making one or both choices			0
justice @entity279 , a liberal , turned 74 last month			0
justice @entity280 is 64 , @entity73 is 62 , while @entity72 , @entity75 , and @entity76 are all in their 50s			0
record number of justices attends @entity285			0

health care ruling had exactly zero impact on the presidential race at the time
next president could name between one and three members to court
@entity170 politician or low - key @entity0 lawyer could be next
