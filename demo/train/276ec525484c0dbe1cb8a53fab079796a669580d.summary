" based in the city of @entity22 , @entity25 's chief commercial and industrial hub , @entity10 's baking business produces all sorts of custom - made " sweet temptations " -- from delicious red velvet cakes topped with moist cream cheese frosting to fluffy chocolate cupcakes full of rich flavor			1
driven by passion yet , crafting yummy baked goods was not something the young entrepreneur had ever envisaged			0
a trained lawyer , @entity10 had been working in the local legal industry for a number of years when one day in late 2012 she began helping her sister - in - law bake desserts			1
" i never knew i had this passion for cakes , " she says			0
" sometimes a passion comes from the comments that people make -- if people say , ' this is great , this is awesome , ' you 're inclined to do more , you want to explore more and you want to improve on it , " adds @entity10			1
" i want to get to the next level ; i want to be different , " she adds			0
" i 'm very passionate about what i do			0
" thus , last year , @entity10 decided to turn her passion for cake making into something bigger			1
without having any formal training in baking , she launched @entity11 by @entity12 -- all the while keeping her full - time law job			1
" it was n't easy , " recalls the 30 - year - old entrepreneur			1

" bigger dreams yet , running a cake business in @entity25 comes with its own set of difficulties -- a beautiful landlocked country in southeastern @entity95 , @entity25 is one of the continent 's poorest nations			1
" you 'd get power cuts at any time of the day , especially in the evening , " says @entity10			1
another challenge , she adds , is finding all the ingredients required , especially as client orders get more diverse -- from superheroes and football logos to hen party cakes in the shape of a female body wearing lingerie			0
" now people want to go crazy , " says @entity10			2
" they want different shapes , they want different sizes , they want different types of icing and to find that in @entity25 is quite challenging -- there 's been a few people who have tried to bring stuff in from overseas but obviously to get it is very expensive			2
" although still at the beginning , @entity10 has high hopes about her startup 's future			2
" i want a coffee shop , " she says			0
" i want a nice place , a cozy shop where i can have my own coffee shop and serve the cakes that i make -- that 's my future plan , that 's what i want to do			0
