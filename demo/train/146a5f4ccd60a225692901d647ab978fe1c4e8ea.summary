-- the widely anticipated " @entity7 " will be the culmination of a story spanning a galaxy and eight years of development and drawing millions of fans around the world			1
in the third and final installment of the series , set for release tuesday , protagonist @entity8 returns for a battle to retake @entity13 from an advanced race of synthetics , known as @entity16 , who want to cleanse the @entity18 of all intelligent organic life			1
developers from @entity21 had always planned the series as a trilogy , so everything from the first two games has been leading up to this climax			2
" on one hand , we knew where things were going so we could build these huge story arcs in the first one , and even in the second one , that would get resolved in the third game , " said @entity27 , executive producer of the " @entity7 " series			1
" at the same time , we were able to be pretty flexible in developing it mechanically so that as we started to really like certain story arcs and characters , we could build those in more and let players get more enjoyment out of playing			2
" but the question now becomes -- how to satisfy a fan base already engaged with the story 's lore while remaining accessible to players who may just be meeting @entity8 in the " @entity7 " universe ? fans of the science fiction / fantasy genre are familiar with how trilogies end			1
whether it is @entity53 tossing the emperor off a balcony or @entity56 falling into the lava and destroying the one ring , you can be sure of two things : really big things are going to happen , and there will be a dramatic twist at the end			0
@entity27 said the way the " @entity66 " series is built allows experienced players to continue with the stories they 've already worked on but also provides entry points for new players to get quickly acclimated to the tale and begin their own adventure			1
as with " @entity75 , " players who have saved characters will be able to import them into " @entity7 , " changing some dialogue ( the game will have a hefty 40,000 lines ) and missions to reflect actions taken in previous games			1
new players are quickly brought up to speed through some introductory missions and different dialogue from experienced characters			1
but @entity27 said new players should n't feel like they are missing out on anything			2
" the fact that it is a third story means that 's where you get to decide the fate of entire civilizations because we know this is the third of three , " he said			0
" if you are coming in as a new player , those plot lines are established , but you also get to make the biggest decisions in them			2
for existing players , it 's mind - blowing that they 've gotten to know people and characters from a given species that they can choose to wipe out in ' @entity7			1
' " he added , " that was the real fun of developing ' @entity7			1
' this is the beginning of all the biggest things you get to do in the ' @entity66 ' series , and then everything comes to an end that you define as a player			2
" defining the parameters of the story and possibilities for the ending pushed the limits of @entity27 's team , he said			0
since it 's the final episode , everything needs to get resolved and all lingering questions answered			0
@entity27 said that despite players being in the driver 's seat , they want to see that developers have created interesting and satisfying conclusions of the story arcs in which they 've become invested			2
which species will live and which will die ? which major character does n't make it to the end , and who will be left for the final battle ? players , new and veteran , will both have those choices to make and be saddled with the emotional baggage that goes along with it			1
" the team was really pushing to put little bits of fun even in the final days			0
( the game ) ended up being bigger than what we thought it would be , " @entity27 said			0
" whether you are a really passionate fan about the fiction or you 're fairly casual about it or you 're new to it , it should be a great story for everybody			0
we tried to build it as a story regardless of how familiar you are with the ' @entity66 ' universe			0
" this is really the biggest part of this series			0
that 's what the whole story 's about			0
" " @entity7 " will be available tuesday in @entity163 , thursday in @entity164 , march 9 in @entity165 and march 15 in @entity166			1
it is playable on the @entity168 , @entity169 360 and @entity170			0
