-- a dream vacation to most sounded like a nightmare to @entity3			1
in 2006 , @entity5 ' husband won an all - expense - paid trip to @entity7 , and scuba diving was one of the included activities			1
she wanted to go , but not enough to put on a bathing suit			0
" it was at that moment that i realized that my weight was preventing me from living , " @entity5 said			1
a stay - at - home mom in @entity18 , @entity19 , 35 - year - old @entity5 had been at a normal body mass index most of her life			1
but with the birth of first child , she started adding weight to her 5 - foot - 6 frame			2
less than two years after the first , she was pregnant with her second child			2
@entity5 said her weight gain was a combination of " pregnancy weight , a bit of depression and a whole lot of negative self - esteem			1
" during the pregnancy , her husband switched jobs , and was living in @entity37 for a month during his training			0
after that , he began traveling frequently			0
" i was at home with two kids under the age of 2 , " @entity5 said			1
" the weight kept piling on			2
at her heaviest , she says she was up to 287 pounds and wearing a size 24			2
when she returned home from @entity7 , she was ready to lose weight , but was n't yet sure where to start			2
thinking her way thin her mother had been trying a different approach than most : " hypnosis gastric bypass " with @entity55 - based certified hypnotist , @entity56			1
@entity5 saw the results her mother was getting , and in late 2007 , she scheduled an appointment with @entity56			1
gastric bypass surgery , sometimes called bariatric surgery , divides the stomach into a small upper pouch and a larger pouch that 's unused , physically shrinking the stomach 's capacity to hold food			1
the results are that patients are n't able to eat as much , due to their smaller stomachs			2
hypnosis gastric bypass is exactly what its name implies			1
a hypnotist walks patients through a simulated version of gastric bypass surgery -- from meeting the doctor , nurse and anesthesiologist to describing the surgical procedure to leaving the hospital			1
after hypnosis , @entity56 said , the mind believes the stomach is smaller , decreasing appetite and shrinking the physical capacity for food			1
there are also other types of weight loss hypnosis -- some focus on retraining the brain to simply eat healthier or less			1
because hypnosis is n't a mainstream weight loss method , there are limited studies about its effectiveness			1
in one 1996 meta - analysis that looked at six previous studies , researchers found participants who used hypnosis averaged a 15 - pound weight loss at the end of treatment , compared to the control group who lost an average of 6 pounds without hypnosis			1
study author @entity106 noted that the studies he compared varied in the length of treatment time , ranging from two months to two years			2
@entity106 found a connection between longer treatment time and results , suggesting that the impact of hypnosis increases with time , and may be a useful tool for weight loss maintenance			1
a self - described sugar and carb addict , @entity56 found herself very ill at age 26			0
" i needed a pacemaker , and ... i saw an opportunity to change my lifestyle			0
" she developed the hypnosis program after her health scare in 1990 , and after using it herself , began passing it along to her patients			2
" it 's about changing the way you think about food subconsciously , " @entity56 said			0
" and it 's great for people who hate dieting , since they do n't feel like they 're giving up food			0
" @entity5 had three private sessions with @entity56 for three days in a row , and took home several @entity138 an immediate change after her first session , @entity5 said she started craving spinach			2
by the next day , she said she was eating a quarter of what she had before			0
" i physically could n't eat as much as i had been , and i only wanted really healthy things , " she said			0
" i have n't had a soda since that day , whereas before , it was every day			0
" the weight came off steadily at the beginning			2
but as it does for many people , the losses eventually began to slow			0
after she lost 100 pounds , @entity5 started exercising in order to reach her goal			1
" i love it now , but the first time actually going to the gym was the hardest , " she said			0
" i felt like i was going into a shark tank			0
" it took two years to reach her goal of 150 pounds , losing almost half of her body weight			1
@entity5 has since maintained her weight for over three years			1
she does a lot of weight training and said she tries not to weigh herself , since muscle weighs more than fat			0
instead , she prefers to say that she wears a size 6 , and has done so for years			0
although gastric bypass hypnosis may help some people lose weight , experts say there are other benefits gained from the real surgery besides a smaller stomach size			1
" there are changes in many gut and brain hormones after bypass surgery and other operations for weight loss , " said dr. @entity177 , director of @entity179 's @entity178			1
" this is why it 's becoming more common to call this ' metabolic surgery ' than ' bariatric surgery			0
' " @entity192 said that the hunger hormone , ghrelin , drops post-surgery , helping patients to feel less hungry and eat less			0
there are also hormonal changes that improve the way the body processes sugars and fats , which can reduce the risk of diabetes and lower cholesterol			0
although @entity192 has read about people who 've been able to lose weight through hypnosis , she does n't think it 's for everyone			2
" i do n't think as many people will have success with this as with metabolic surgery , " she said			0
" many people are able to lose weight through diet and exercise , but it 's keeping the weight off long - term that 's the challenge			0
" three years of success but for @entity5 , hypnosis worked and she 's beaten the odds by keeping the weight off			1
she does n't listen to @entity56 's cds every day anymore but uses them on an " as needed basis			0
" her husband , @entity5 , said that his wife 's determination to eat well and exercise daily has been a positive influence on the rest of the family			2
" i certainly live a more healthy and active life than i did before			0
" " she has proven to ( our children ) that it is possible to overcome obstacles , regardless of how imposing they might seem , " he said			0
" you have to work hard for the things you want to achieve			0
" although @entity5 still has n't gone scuba diving , she said she 's ready and waiting for the chance to experience what she missed when her weight was holding her back .			1
