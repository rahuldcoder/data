-- after nearly going to war last year over a @entity4 military raid inside @entity5 , the two nations seemed to be patching relations when their foreign ministers met a few weeks ago			1
then an @entity5 judge issued an arrest warrant this week for the head of the @entity4 armed forces , pushing relations back one giant step			1
@entity4 gen. @entity14 , the armed forces chief whose arrest is sought , canceled a meeting scheduled for friday with @entity5 gen. @entity18			1
@entity19 thought he might be arrested if he traveled to @entity5			2
it 's not the first pothole on the path to normalization			0
@entity5 previously issued an arrest warrant for former @entity4 defense minister @entity25 , who held the post during last year 's raid			1
@entity4 has dismissed both warrants , saying @entity5 has no jurisdiction to investigate and judge @entity4 officials			1
analyst @entity31 of the @entity33 consulting firm calls @entity5 's actions " schizophrenic			2
" two former @entity36 ambassadors to the area agree this is par for @entity5 foreign policy			2
" that 's the history of @entity5 , unfortunately , " said @entity40 , ambassador to that nation from 1993 to 1996			2
" one step forward , two steps back			0
" @entity44 , @entity36 ambassador to @entity4 from 1994 to 1997 , said friday that " @entity5 is a specialist in bonehead plays			1
it has been for years			0
" former @entity5 foreign minister @entity49 , who served from 2000 to 2003 , called the arrest warrant " lamentable			1
" " it 's absurd that these things happen , " he said friday			0
tension between the two nations has existed for years			0
the latest enmity started in march 2008 , when @entity4 bombed a guerrilla base inside @entity5			1
the raid killed a top leader for the @entity59 of @entity4 , commonly known as the @entity60			1
the @entity62 guerrilla group has been waging war on @entity4 since the 1960s and often takes refuge on the @entity5 side of the border			1
at least 25 people were killed , most of them said to be @entity60 guerrillas			2
@entity4 president @entity71 hailed the attack , saying " terrorism ... does not respect borders			2
" @entity5 president @entity75 called the attack " aggression " and a " massacre " and severed diplomatic relations with @entity4			1
both nations went on war footing but stopped short of military action			0
over time , tensions seemed to dissipate and @entity4 foreign minister @entity84 and his @entity5 counterpart , @entity85 , met last month			1
after the meeting , @entity4 signed a statement saying it would never attack inside @entity5 again			1
friday 's meeting between the two nations ' top generals was supposed to further repair the damage			0
then came the arrest warrant			1
what happened ? perhaps politics			0
definitely one branch of the government acting without the consent of the other			0
@entity85 quickly pointed out that the nation 's judicial branch , not @entity75 's administration , decided to issue the warrant			0
analysts agree that it was n't @entity75 's doing			0
" that 's not a very coordinated government , " said @entity44 , the former envoy to @entity4			2
" the executive branch did n't issue that order			0
" @entity49 , the former @entity5 foreign minister , said the judge who issued the arrest warrant is " motivated by political criteria			1
" " i do n't have another explanation , " said @entity49 , who also served as president of the @entity5 @entity116 three times			2
normalization of relations will be a slow process , @entity33 analyst @entity31 said			0
" we 're going to see a lot of stops and starts , " he said			0
@entity127 , editorial director of @entity129 weekly news magazine in @entity4 , said relations will not improve until the two countries " can close the chapter " on last year 's bombing raid			2
" that chapter can be closed when the @entity4 government promises not to do that			2
they have done that ( promise ) , " @entity25 said			0
" now @entity5 needs to start avoiding those types of judicial measures against @entity4 officials			1
" @entity31 said @entity5 felt justifiably aggrieved over the attack and wants to make sure it never happens again			0
but he also sees another issue at play : @entity5 president @entity75 's plummeting poll numbers and domestic problems with indigenous movements and other political issues			2
" it 's usually convenient to remind everyone that @entity75 is fighting for @entity5 sovereignty , " @entity31 said , adding that such nationalism " resonates very broadly " across the political spectrum			0
but @entity44 said , " @entity75 really does want to reach some kind of agreement			0
" the problems between the two nations are long - standing and have a lot to do with the 45 - year - old war between @entity4 and the @entity60			1
from @entity5 's perspective , the war has displaced about 250,000 @entity4 who have sought refuge in @entity5			1
those refugees need services and jobs , further straining a poor area that 's already on the brink			0
@entity5 also resents that the @entity60 have set up camps inside the country , causing security problems for a nation that is not technically at war with the guerrillas			1
from @entity4 's point of view , @entity5 is not doing enough to combat the @entity60 and is allowing the guerrillas to have a sanctuary that @entity4 troops can not reach			1
further complicating the relationship , @entity5 's @entity75 is politically aligned with @entity181 president @entity180 , who is no friend of @entity4 and its leader , @entity71			1
@entity180 threatened to attack neighboring @entity4 after the military raid in @entity5			1
" this has been developing for many years , " @entity49 said			0
but there are great advantages to normalizing relations , most of them economic			0
@entity5 , for example , is @entity4 's third - largest export market			1
@entity192 , president of @entity194 and director of @entity196 in @entity197 , @entity5 , and @entity198 , president of the @entity199 in @entity200 , @entity201 , talked with the @entity202 last month about @entity4 - @entity5 economic activity			1
" re-establishing relations could lead @entity5 to lift sanctions against @entity4 products , which forced many small - and medium - sized businesses to collapse on both sides of the border , " @entity204 told the @entity206 - based think tank			1
said @entity192 , " for @entity4 , @entity5 is an important market			1
not so the other way around			0
but the goods @entity5 sells @entity4 are difficult to relocate to other markets			2
@entity5 now attempts to sell @entity218 and @entity219 the rice it would have otherwise sold @entity4			2
also , @entity5 importers have to look for other sources			0
" @entity49 , the former foreign minister , wants normalization to get back on track			0
" we have to close the parenthesis , " he said			0
" i hope this passes ... and that they start talking again			0

@entity5 judge issues an arrest warrant for head of @entity4 armed forces
@entity4 gen. @entity14 cancels trip to @entity5 for fear of arrest
tensions between neighbors stem from @entity60 *rebels* taking refuge in @entity5
