-- as a country music recording artist , as an entertainer and especially as a husband and father , life can get hectic			0
i realized early on the importance of having a routine to manage such a busy schedule			0
but my body kept giving me " reminders " earlier in my career that something was just not right			0
in the mid- ' 90s , i started to experience tingling and numbness on my right side along with facial spasms			0
i hoped they would pass , but symptoms continued to appear all too frequently			0
after a battery of tests , i was diagnosed with relapsing - remitting multiple sclerosis , the most common form of multiple sclerosis			1
my diagnosis came when i was 26			2
it surprised me to learn that of 400,000 americans with @entity29 , many are diagnosed between ages 20 and 50 , like i was			1
i kept wondering , " why me ? why now ? " my career was progressing , and there were many positive things going on in my life : i had just recorded my fourth album and was celebrating the birth of my first child			0
so this country boy decided he was not going down without a fight			0
with support from my family and friends , i realized that i needed to stop dwelling on being diagnosed with a chronic disease , and instead focus on finding a groove			2
to do that , i had to develop a routine to manage my condition , which helped me look forward for the first time since being diagnosed			2
@entity50 - remitting multiple sclerosis can be tricky to manage because it affects everyone differently			1
in fact , it took almost a year of working with my neurologist to find the routine that worked best for me			0
living with multiple sclerosis means struggles and triumphs i 've learned to eat a healthy diet and keep up a moderate exercise routine , take my medication and rely on love and support from my family to get through the tough times			1
now that i 've found a routine that works , i stick with it and encourage others with this illness to do the same			0
i 'm proud to help lead the " stick with it " campaign to educate patients with relapsing - remitting multiple sclerosis about the importance of sticking with a routine for the long haul			1
experts agree that patients do better when sticking with a routine that works for them			2
there 's a lot of information out there that can sometimes be confusing , but i encourage folks to talk to their doctor to find what can work best for them			2
" stick with it " includes national public service announcements to start airing this month , along with a @entity91 page that is coming soon			0
both will provide tips on how @entity29 patients can work with their doctor			1
" stick with it " is in partnership with @entity97 and @entity98 , the charity i founded a decade ago to help provide educational information and fund programs for those with @entity29 i did n't have the information available when i was diagnosed , and i want to make sure others with @entity29 do n't feel as lost in this disease as i once was			1
helping others with relapsing - remitting multiple sclerosis has been close to my heart for some time			1
it 's all the motivation i need to " stick with it ! " in addition to being a country music artist , @entity110 is also an ambassador for the @entity113 and a paid spokesman for @entity97 , manufacturer of one of nine medications approved for treating relapsing - remitting multiple sclerosis .			1

@entity110 was diagnosed with relapsing - remitting multiple sclerosis at 26
he says he 's learned to eat a healthy diet and rely on his family
@entity110 has begun a campaign to educate @entity29 patients
