could a newly released audio provide more clues on what led up to @entity4 's shooting death ? the @entity7 has questioned a man who says he recorded audio of gunfire at the time @entity4 was shot by @entity11 , @entity12 , police on august 9 , the man 's attorney told @entity14			1
in the recording , a quick series of shots can be heard , followed by a pause and then another quick succession of shots			1
forensic audio expert @entity21 analyzed the recording and said he detected at least 10 gunshots -- a cluster of six , followed by four			1
" i was very concerned about that pause ... because it 's not just the number of gunshots , it 's how they 're fired , " the man 's attorney , @entity24 , told @entity14 's @entity26			1
" and that has a huge relevance on how this case might finally end up			0
" the man , who asked that his identity not be revealed , lives near the site of the shooting and was close enough to have heard the gunshots , his attorney said			1
he was speaking to a friend on a video chat service and happened to be recording the conversation at the same time @entity4 was shot , @entity24 said			1
the attorney said she learned of the man 's recording late last week from a mutual friend			1
" i had to get his consent before i could reach out to the @entity7 , " @entity24 said			2
@entity14 can not independently verify the authenticity of the tape and has asked the @entity7 for confirmation of their interview with the man who made the recording			1
the meaning of the pause it 's difficult to prove from the audio why the pause took place or whose narrative it supports			0
attorney @entity65 said he was surprised by the gap in shots			0
" it 's the pause that gives most concern in a police shooting , especially with an unarmed victim , because at this point mr. @entity4 is defenseless -- he has no weapon , " said @entity65 , who represented the family of @entity69			1
like @entity4 , @entity69 was an unarmed @entity77 - @entity76 man who was shot and killed by a white police officer			1
but if the gunfire heard on the audio is indeed from the @entity4 incident , the pause does n't automatically suggest wrongful intent by the officer			1
" to be fair , there could be other explanations for that pause , " said attorney @entity85 , co-host of @entity14 's " @entity86			2
" " maybe the officer will say , ' well , i fired and he kept advancing , so i fired again			0
' " witnesses and a friend of officer @entity92 have given conflicting accounts of what led up to @entity4 's death			2
dueling narratives in @entity4 shooting @entity98 , a friend of @entity4 's who was walking with him at the time of the shooting , said the officer shot @entity4 once by the police car and again as he ran away			1
according to @entity98 , @entity4 was struck in the back and then turned around and put his arms up as the officer kept shooting			2
but a woman who identified herself as a friend of @entity92 called into a @entity106 radio show last week with what she said was the officer 's version of events			0
the caller , who identified herself only as " @entity112 , " said @entity4 taunted the officer and charged at him			2
her account accurately matches what @entity92 has told investigators , a source with detailed knowledge of the investigation told @entity14			0
an autopsy showed that all the entry wounds were in the front of @entity4 's body			0
will autopsy shed any light on what happened ? key witness speaks out @entity11 police said @entity4 allegedly robbed a convenience store shortly before the shooting			2
and reports that his friend @entity98 had a criminal record that includes lying to police has put @entity98 's credibility in question			0
in 2011 , @entity98 was arrested and accused of theft and lying to police about his first name , age and address			0
@entity98 said monday night he does n't understand why some are questioning his credibility			0
" i see they bring up my past , my history , but it 's not like it 's a long rap sheet , " @entity98 told @entity26			0
" this one incident should n't make me a bad person			0
" @entity4 's funeral : @entity147 , tears and a call for social change complete coverage			0
