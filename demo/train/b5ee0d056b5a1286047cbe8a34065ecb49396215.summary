@entity0 -- president @entity4 wrote a personal letter to @entity7 leader @entity6 that a @entity3 envoy delivered , a senior @entity3 official said wednesday			1
@entity9 , @entity3 special envoy for @entity7 , delivered the letter for the @entity7 leader during a three - day visit to @entity7 last week , the official said			1
the official declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the issue			0
@entity9 noted last week that , during his visit , he " communicated president @entity4 's view that complete denuclearization of the @entity17 is a fundamental undertaking of the six - party process ... and that the absence of progress on denuclearization is an obstacle to improving our relations			1
" as @entity4 " has made it clear , the @entity3 is prepared to work with allies [ and ] partners in the region to offer ... @entity7 a different future , " he said			2
@entity9 also said he wanted to reaffirm the goal of " fully implementing " a september 2005 joint statement issued by the nations in the six - party talks , declaring that @entity7 had " committed to abandoning all nuclear weapons and existing nuclear programs			1
" @entity7 , however , has refused to return to the talks conducted by the @entity3 , @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 and @entity43 , insisting that it wants to talk directly with the @entity3 government			0
in april , @entity45 declared the talks " dead " in anger over international criticism of its nuclear and missile tests this year			0
@entity9 's visit did not result in any promise from the @entity7 government to return to the six - party negotiations aimed at ending its nuclear program			1
secretary of state @entity57 , however , last week called the meeting " quite positive			0
" " it does remain to be seen whether and when the @entity7 will return to the six - party talks , but the bottom line is that these were exploratory talks , not negotiations , " she said			2
@entity64 previously said the @entity3 was willing to meet bilaterally with @entity7 but only within the framework of the six - party talks			1
she also has warned the @entity3 will not normalize ties with @entity45 or lift sanctions unless @entity7 takes irreversible steps toward dismantling its nuclear program			2

recent reports in @entity74 , @entity42 , have claimed @entity7 is in the final stages of restoring its @entity77 nuclear plant , which @entity45 had begun to disable before walking away from the six - party talks			1
given the secrecy of the @entity7 , those reports could not be verified			0
analysts said @entity7 also is desperate to break out of its diplomatic isolation and ease its economic pain , especially after the @entity83 imposed tougher sanctions on the country in response to @entity45 's nuclear and missile tests			0
