@entity0 -- @entity2 proposed a $ 110 billion measure thursday to put off mandatory across - the - board spending cuts set to take effect march 1			1
the package made public by @entity2 @entity8 leaders calls for replacing the so - called sequester cuts with a combination of increased tax revenue from millionaires , ending agriculture subsidies and reducing defense spending after the war in @entity16 ends			1
@entity18 leaders in @entity19 have demanded that @entity2 come up with a plan for avoiding the imminent cuts , technically known as sequestration			2
however , the @entity18 opposes any increase in tax rates or other steps to bring in more tax revenue , saying the nation needs to reduce the cost of government			0
@entity30 : cuts would hit foreign aid , diplomatic security " i would respectfully disagree that the @entity37 people are going to suddenly demand more tax hikes , " an aide to @entity35 leader @entity35 said			1
a @entity40 statement said that opposing what it called the balanced plan by @entity2 would amount to prioritizing " tax loopholes that benefit the very few at the expense of middle - and working - class @entity37			1
" the issue extends a long - running political dispute over government spending and federal deficits that dominated president @entity51 's first term , as well as his successful re-election campaign last year			0
republicans were forced to concede on their steadfast opposition to increased taxes by agreeing in january to higher rates on top income earners as part of a deal to avoid some of the harshest impacts of what was known as the fiscal cliff , which included the sequester cuts and automatic tax hikes			1
@entity65 : spending cuts will hurt homeland security that agreement put off action on the sequester cuts , which were mandated by a 2011 agreement to raise the federal debt ceiling			1
the purpose of the deep cuts to all discretionary programs and the military was to motivate @entity19 to reach a comprehensive deficit reduction agreement that would replace it			0
however , such a deal has proved impossible , leading to the imminent application of $ 85 billion in spending cuts for 2013 and almost $ 1 trillion over 10 years			1
defense secretary @entity82 and other officials warn that the cuts will have a dire impact on government operations and military readiness			2
the @entity88 would absorb about half of the reductions			0
while the @entity40 and congressional leaders from both parties oppose sequestration , the approach for averting it has become the latest congressional showdown involving ideological differences over the size and role of government			1
house speaker @entity101 noted on thursday that the @entity40 passed bills last year to prevent the cuts from affecting the military , but @entity2 @entity2 never acted			1
" those days are over , " @entity101 declared , but he also signaled a willingness to negotiate with the @entity2 over any legislation it sends over			0
" it 's time for the @entity2 to do their work			0
we can ... if they 're willing to pass a bill , we 'll find some way to work with them to address this problem			0
" @entity82 : @entity116 is watching @entity37 on budget the plan unveiled thursday by @entity2 would just replace the cuts through the end of this year , leaving time for possible negotiations on a broader deficit - reduction package that would eliminate sequestration entirely			1
the @entity2 proposed $ 54 billion in revenue by implementing the " @entity126 rule , " a principle by billionaire financier @entity126 that he should n't pay a lower tax rate than his secretary			0
under it , anyone with adjusted income of more than $ 1 million after charitable deductions would pay a minimum 30 % tax rate			2
other revenue measures in the package include ending tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas and closing tax loopholes for the oil industry			1
in addition , the package would cut military funding starting in 2015 , following the planned end of @entity37 combat operations next year in @entity16			2
it would also end agriculture subsidies for a total saving of $ 55 billion			0
" billions in direct payment subsidies are paid out even in good times and for crops farmers are n't even growing , " explained sen. @entity150 , @entity151 , who chairs the @entity152			2
@entity82 said wednesday that @entity19 needs to put aside party and ideological divisions that he called " the greatest concern i have for our national security			0
" he expressed concern over how the world will view the @entity37 if it fails to avert sequestration			2
" what ( other countries ) worry about is what i worry about , which is whether or not we can govern and whether or not we can face the tough decisions that have to be made and resolve those , " @entity82 said			0
@entity1 's @entity170 contributed to this report .			0
