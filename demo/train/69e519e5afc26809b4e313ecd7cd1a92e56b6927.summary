@entity0 -- in some of the most personal and unscripted comments on race of his presidency , president @entity2 broke his silence friday with surprise remarks from the @entity9 on @entity10 , his first public comments since a @entity13 jury acquitted @entity14 in the teenager 's shooting death			1
" you know , when @entity10 was first shot , i said that this could have been my son , " said @entity2 , who entered the @entity9 briefing room friday afternoon without notes or a teleprompter			1
" another way of saying that is @entity10 could have been me , 35 years ago			2
" " and when you think about why , in the @entity27 - @entity27 community at least , there 's a lot of pain around what happened here , i think it 's important to recognize that the @entity27 - @entity27 community is looking at this issue through a set of experiences and a history that does n't go away			2
" but across the country , different audiences appear to have heard very different things in @entity2 's remarks			1
from social media to comments on the web to on - air discussions , @entity2 's remarks were seen as both " a truly historic moment " and simultaneously said to have been " fanning the flames of racism			1
" " so much for this president ' transcending ' race , " said conservative commentator @entity49 on her @entity51 feed			1
" @entity2 's comments as @entity55 today were quite provocative and racially inflammatory			1
" @entity56 had just the opposite feeling , commenting on @entity1			0
" thank you mr. president			2
i am proud of you taking the first step , is up to all of @entity63 to stop this			0
" but @entity65 shot back on @entity51 : " @entity66 ! ! ! ! ! he is not guilty			0
stop this mad witch hunt ! " @entity1 senior political analyst @entity69 focused on the tone @entity2 took , saying that the president was speaking from the heart , " not using a teleprompter , like we very often see this president using			1
the words that come to mind are heartfelt , " she said			0
" very sober about this			0
talking about how @entity27 - @entity27 look at this case through a history that does n't go away			0
" @entity81 , executive director of @entity82 , an activist group that promotes nonviolent social change and has been protesting @entity13 's " stand your ground " law , told @entity1 that he was encouraged @entity2 " was speaking about the issues in the way we are speaking about the issues			1
" " i hope he follows that up with action ... in any way that he can , " @entity81 said			0
@entity81 praised the president for " lending his voice to the situation " and " showing some bravery and showing some leadership at the top			1
" he added that " we 're hoping other leaders , including our governor , follow suit			0
" gov. @entity104 met overnight friday with @entity106 protesters staging a sit - in at the governor 's office and defended his position not to amend the controversial law			2
the protesters said they will continue their sit - in until their demand is met			0
@entity2 last dealt with themes of race head - on as a presidential candidate in 2008 , when he talked about his own struggles with race during a speech at @entity120 in @entity121			1
" at various stages in the campaign , some commentators have deemed me either ' too black ' or ' not black enough , ' " he said then			0
@entity125 , a @entity1 contributor and former head of the @entity128 , responded on @entity129 to @entity2 's comment that he did n't see a need for politicians to lead a national discussion on race			1
responding to @entity2 's comment that he did n't " think it 's particularly productive when politicians try to convene discussions " on race , she tweeted " agree with # @entity55			1
" @entity138 , a conservative commentator and @entity1 political contributor , was surprised that @entity2 even addressed the issue of race			1
" i 'm shocked because he said he was going to be the president for everyone , and obviously today he said i 'm going to be the president for just the @entity27 - @entity27 community , and everyone else better listen up , " said @entity138			2
" the president 's job is to be president for everyone			2
he basically said to everyone protesting that the system is broken for @entity27			2
you have a right to be angry about this			0
" both others pushed back			0
" this is n't something that black men make up or want to happen , " said @entity1 's @entity158			0
" if you have the most powerful @entity27 - @entity27 man in the world telling you that there is a problem -- there 's nothing in this politically for him -- perhaps people like @entity138 ... should listen , should sleep on it , before they react and deny the context of what could have happen to @entity10 and what could be , what is happening to most @entity27 men in this country			0
" according to a recent @entity176 poll released before the @entity14 verdict , 52 % of @entity27 are dissatisfied about how blacks are treated by society , while 47 % say they are satisfied .			1
