-- last summer an @entity2 tornado ripped through my town , @entity5 , @entity6			1
there is a very particular feeling of vulnerability you experience in such a violent storm			0
you crouch in a dark basement , the windows explode inwards , and you have no idea if the groaning beams will hold			0
we had no directly storm - related deaths in @entity5 , despite the rarity of a tornado in our region			1
we were prepared , whether through federal programs or memory of the movie @entity24 , to shelter and ride out the storm			0
the tornado took its toll -- more than 270 homes in @entity5 sustained damage			1
my own was rendered unlivable , our family displaced for a year			0
we were n't ready for recovery , however			2
during a painful period , our community learned how to manage volunteers and donations , track data , apply for grants and request aid through official channels			1
we bumbled through the early days , doing things wrong and wasting time			2
eventually a system emerged , coordinated largely by the @entity44 of @entity5 and a few dedicated local volunteers			1
but why did we have to build that system on our own ? though we were prepared to survive the storm , why had n't someone prepared us for recovery ? baffled by the acute lack of community recovery tools , my sister and i decided to build them			1
we put together a team and built an in - kind resource management system for untrained local organizers			1
we have been working with communities and emergency managers across the country to deploy the system through our company , @entity61			2
@entity62 : the oil spill 's unseen culprits , victims most disaster preparedness programs concentrate on preparing residents to take care of themselves and their families for the first 72 hours following a disaster			1
a less frequent focus is how to prepare local residents to take care of their communities during the months and years of recovery that will follow			1
organizing at the local level does not require a membership card -- there are things each of us can do locally to speed recovery			1
in the first few days post-disaster , scores of organizations will sweep in and out of an affected area , assessing damage , providing emergency aid , mobilizing teams of volunteers			2
in most areas , however , there is an often - overlooked community response working alongside these organizations			1
these folks are usually poorly equipped and hastily organized			0
their qualifications ? they live here			0
they were here before the aid			0
they will be here meeting needs when everyone else goes home			0
disaster recovery is changing in the @entity104			1
while large aid organizations like the @entity107 and @entity108 can mobilize massive amounts of crucial resources , they often do not manage spontaneous donations , track local volunteer hours , or stay long term			1
it is the local church , or library , or the city manager that ends up matching those with needs with aid long term			1
they do it on post-it notes , or @entity123 , but they get it done			0
ordinary people ( read : you ) are realizing that they are both allowed and are needed to respond			0
@entity62 : reporting crisis via texting community - powered recovery is simple , and it happens everywhere			1
i point to tornado recovery in @entity132 , @entity133 ; the @entity135 neighborhood in @entity136 following @entity137 ; and the small town of @entity139 , @entity140 , after an @entity2 tornado			1
in each area , local efforts were instrumental to overall recovery			1
the problem here is one of planning : each of these community efforts was seat - of - the - pants , as they 'll readily admit			1
if community in each case was such an integral part of the recovery , why were n't they written into the plan ? beyond local labor , the most neglected facet of disaster recovery is local data			1
outside aid organizations usually activate their own resources and trained volunteers			2
they will often turn away spontaneous untrained volunteers or unsolicited donation items			2
unfortunately , this also means that unless local organizers are efficiently using these resources , they go to waste			2
after a disaster , you normally have roughly seven days ( fewer in small disasters ) of media interest in which you can collect aid			2
if you do n't have a system for recording the names and contact information of people who would like to donate or volunteer until week 2 , you 've missed out on perhaps 50 % of all resources that will ever be reported			0
to aid your community , you have to plan ahead , not just for the first 72 hours , but for the next few years of needs			2
@entity62 : what 's left to explore ? as we begin to respond to the damage from @entity191 , these are things to keep in mind			2
@entity136 has seen this before , and has systems in place to accept volunteers and donations			1
recovery from @entity191 will not be easy , but it will be much faster because they are " prepared " to handle resources			2
here are a few tips for getting involved at the community level : community organizers : get smart : it is not as simple as setting up a shade tent , or just directing people where to go			1
sending a 17 - year - old into the woods with a chainsaw is asking for a lawsuit			2
if you are going to get involved with recovery , you have to do so responsibly , with the safety and well - being of both survivors and volunteers as your priority			1
get a system : speak to your area 's emergency manager about what kind of information they will need you to collect			0
if they need to know how many hours were worked on @entity226 , you need to be tracking that information ! use the web : but do n't expect everyone to			0
you may be a @entity230 whiz , but you need to be prepared to spread information on a regular web page , paper , or by word of mouth			0
you can help your emergency manager by spreading their information through your social media stream			0
affected households : document everything : from photos of the damage , to the names of the caseworkers you speak to in different organizations -- and keep records of what is going on			0
look for help proactively : many homeowners spend out insurance money on things like toiletries , while boxes of donated goods sit unused in local churches			0
volunteers : do n't be a hero : your intentions are good , but no one on the ground in the affected community is ready for you in the first 72 hours post-disaster			1
if you show up too early , you could even be endangering yourself			0
stand and be counted : the dollar value of hours you work can count toward the amount of aid @entity266 grants the community			0
if you want to volunteer , make sure you are working with an organizer that tracks your hours			0
donors : listen before you bring : are you trying to donate a refrigerator ? does the church you 're bringing it to really have space to store it until it is needed ? call ahead and ask what is needed , or check out local information pages			0
protect yourself : if you post what you would like to donate publicly , everyone sees it			0
for example , you may have just informed the world that you have an extra big screen tv and fine china lying around in your basement			0
find a local organization that needs the items and donate through them			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity291 .			1

@entity291 got involved in disaster recovery when a tornado badly damaged her town
she says communities need help organizing disaster relief in early stages of recovery
she says volunteers , donations need to be coordinated , directed to community 's long - term recovery
@entity291 : it 's vital to involve local residents and to capture local data
