humans have reached the moon and are planning to return samples from @entity3 , but when it comes to exploring the land deep beneath our feet , we have only scratched the surface of our planet			1
this may be about to change with a $ 1 billion mission to drill 6 km ( 3.7 miles ) beneath the seafloor to reach the @entity14 's mantle -- a 3000 km - thick layer of slowly deforming rock between the crust and the core which makes up the majority of our planet -- and bring back the first ever fresh samples			1
it could help answer some of our biggest questions about the origins and evolution of @entity14 itself , with almost all of the sea floor and continents that make up the @entity14 ´ s surface originating from the mantle			1
geologists involved in the project are already comparing it to the @entity36 missions in terms of the value of the samples it could yield			2
however , in order to reach those samples , the team of international scientists must first find a way to grind their way through ultra-hard rocks with 10 km - long ( 6.2 miles ) drill pipes -- a technical challenge that one of the project co-leaders @entity53 , from the @entity55 's @entity54 calls , " the most challenging endeavor in the history of @entity14 science			1
" ' a ship flying in space : ' @entity14 seen through the eyes of an astronaut their task will be all the more difficult for being conducted out in the middle of the ocean			2
it is here that the @entity14 ´ s crust is at its thinnest at around 6 km compared to as much as 60 km ( 37.3 miles ) on land			2
they have already identified three possible locations -- all in the @entity72 -- where the ocean floor was formed at relatively fast spreading mid-ocean ridges , says @entity53			0
the hole they will drill will be just 30 cm in width all the way from the ocean floor to inside the mantle -- a monumental engineering feat. " it will be the equivalent of dangling a steel string the width of a human hair in the deep end of a swimming pool and inserting it into a thimble 1/10 mm wide on the bottom , and then drilling a few meters into the foundations , " says @entity53			0
to get to the mantle scientists will be relying on a purpose - built @entity92 deep - sea drilling vessel called @entity93 , first launched in 2002 and capable of carrying 10 km of drilling pipes			1
it has already set a world - record for the deepest hole in scientific ocean drilling history , reaching 2.2 km into the seafloor			0

the first attempts to reach the @entity14 's mantle actually began back in the early 1960s			1
dubbed " @entity123 " after the @entity116 meteorologist @entity115 who first discovered the boundary between the @entity14 's crust and mantle , a team of @entity114 scientists managed to drill a few meters into the oceanic crust off @entity121 in the eastern pacific			1
the achievement was recognized by a telegram from president @entity126 but the project was closed down in 1966			0
since then , a @entity129 - project in the far north @entity130 during the 1980s has taken over the record for the deepest borehole ever drilled , reaching 12 km into the earth 's crust			1
and in 2011 , the oil giant @entity135 recorded an even longer borehole at just over 12 km in eastern @entity129			0
however , it was n't drilled vertically downwards and only reached soft sedimentary rocks			0
while neither of these record - drilling projects got close to the @entity14 's mantle , they did give the geologists leading the new project -- the @entity144 ( @entity144 ) -- confidence that recent advances in drilling techniques have made their plans more feasible than ever before			1
what we 've done on @entity3 , and what 's next " many of the technologies required are conventional deep - drilling technologies that are presently being used in the oil and gas industry , " explain @entity144 geologists			0
however , given the challenges and the likely cost of $ 1 billion plus , much of which still needs to be raised , skeptics may question the necessity of the mission			0
for @entity53 , reaching the @entity14 's mantle would provide a " legacy of fundamental scientific knowledge " and " inspire " future generations			1
" i was giving a lecture to a group of 15 - year - old high - school students recently and they [ and their teachers ] were fascinated by the technology and the thought that we could re-enter a hole just a few centimeters across with a drill string dangled from a ship in the open ocean 4 km above			0
" as well as the technical achievement of bringing back samples , the samples themselves will clarify many of the assumptions we have about how our planet works			2
despite making up 68 % of the @entity14 ´ s mass , @entity53 says we only have a " reasonable " idea of what the mantle is made of and how it works			2
" [ the mantle ] is the engine that drives how our planet works and why we have earthquakes and volcanoes and continents			0
we have the textbook cartoons but detailed knowledge is lacking , " he says			0
the @entity92 government has already invested substantially in the project through the construction of @entity93 , with some scientists regarding the mission as the country 's " moon project			1
" if @entity92 support can be combined with other funding , @entity53 says they could start drilling before the end of the decade , making it possible for humans to finally reach the @entity14 's mantle by the early 2020s			1
deepest cracks of @entity14 give clues to life in space			2

scientists planning mission to drill down to @entity14 's mantle and bring back first fresh samples
mantle could hold clues to origin and evolution of the planet
geologist calls it the most " challenging endeavor in the history of @entity14 science "
if project gets the go - ahead , the team hope to reach the mantle by early 2020s
