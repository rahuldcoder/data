combine travel with exercise i love to walk			1
but when i discovered hiking , it took walking to a whole new level			1
suddenly , i found i could combine walking with my passion for traveling			1
in one sense , it 's just walking , but it takes me to new heights , literally			1
i 've hiked all over @entity18 in @entity19 , near where i have my summer home , but it 's fun to figure out where else in the world i want to hike			1
so far i 've accomplished a few major hikes , such as @entity25 , the @entity26 , and @entity27			2
they were all so fabulous and memorable			2
next i 'd love to do some trails in @entity30			2
my favorite workout i started lifting weights many years ago , and i 've always enjoyed it			2
i like feeling strong -- i can literally feel the improvement after each workout , and i know that at minimum i 'm increasing my strength , my bone mass , and maintaining my weight ( especially when i 'm making up for some delicious indulgence at dinner the night before )			2
@entity42 : the no - sweat summer workout because i now have good overall strength and am usually pressed for time , @entity44 , my trainer , has me doing two - in - one moves that are really wonderful			2
for instance , i 'll lie on my back on a bench , holding weights in both hands and arms open perpendicular to the bench			2
as i bring my hands together in a " fly , " i bend one knee to my chest and extend the other leg with each move			1
the works the chest , legs , and core in one move ! @entity42 : top tips for healthy summer skin take a different route every day i almost never take the same route twice			1
i follow different paths through the woods or around the farm , and in the city , i wander down various streets to peek in on new restaurants or shops			2
i take new routes coming into the city so there 's always something novel and interesting to look at -- new architecture , a field , or a reservoir i had n't seen before			1
it helps the brain to always keep things interesting ! and you 'll never be bored			2
play games socially i am not a big social game player , but the value of knowing a fun card game or word or numbers game to play when there is downtime is very beneficial			1
i like cards but have really never had a lot of that " downtime " to engage in poker or bridge or even canasta			2
i recently learned an easy card game called @entity102 that can be played by up to five people , and uses two decks of cards			1
it is a lot of fun and very engaging			1
i do promise , however , to really learn both poker and bridge , and i also promise to one day have some of that elusive downtime we all dream about			2
@entity42 : 13 crazy beauty tricks that really work meeting my mother 's friends when my mother died , i was astonished by how many people came to her funeral			0
it was standing - room only in this large @entity120 in @entity121 , @entity122			0
honestly , i had no idea how many friends she had ! i knew that she kept busy ; she was always writing letters , calling to catch up , offering to drive someone to do errands or see the doctor			0
but i saw that she was so extremely connected to the people in her town			0
talking to these friends after the service was such as lovely , moving experience			0
they each offered me some little reminiscence of my mom -- stories , insights , and memories			0
we all need to work harder on social skills -- visiting , remembering birthdays , taking trips together -- with both friends and family			0
@entity42 : 11 secrets for a happy and healthy summer create a bucket list keep a list of things you want to do or feel you must do during your lifetime -- and then checking them off before you kick the bucket -- is a really good thing			1
that 's why movies like " @entity159 " resonate with so many of us			0
it certainly resonated with me			0
while on a photo shoot in @entity164 , @entity165 , it was important to me to visit @entity166			0
known for its incredible rock formations and its extraordinary vegetative wonders , it had long been on my " bucket list			1
" it was well worth the early 4 a.m. departure and the long drive into the desert			1
it is one of those places i will never forget			0
@entity42 : 10 ultra firming face masks just move on there are any number of incredibly challenging things that i have to deal with every day -- i get mixed news on a financial report , or i have to make a speech in front of hundreds of people			1
so i long ago developed the ability to deal with stress : you just have to solve one problem immediately and , if you have to let off some steam			1
a good way to do this is by going for a quick walk			0
and then , perhaps most important , you move on			1
you do n't ruminate or worry , but keep moving forward			1
life is a pile of problems that have to be solved one way or another , and the best way is to look at each one individually , figure it out , and move on			1
treat your feet well i never wear the same shoes two days in a row			0
rather , i rotate through high heels , medium heels , low heels , and flats			0
also , i do not confine my feet			0
i never wear shoes at home , and when i 'm riding in the car , my feet are bare so i can wiggle my toes and give my feet some air			0
i also walk barefoot on gravel all the time			0
i like to walk on all different kinds of surfaces , particularly when i hike			0
practicing walking on uneven surfaces ( safely ! ) is good for foot health , because it strengthens the ankles and improves balance			0
@entity42 : 9 color boosting and nourishing hair care treatments be proactive living well is not a passive act			1
it is imperative to be engaged in taking care of ourselves			0
in addition to exercising and maintaining a varied and nutritious diet , one of the most important things i do for myself is to make sure i consult the right professionals at the right times			0
i try my best to schedule my routine doctor visits and age - appropriate medical tests for the entire year all at once , using the advice of my primary - care physician ( very important to have one )			0
that way , nothing gets forgotten and everything will be done when it should be			0
get those appointments on you calendar now if you have n't already -- and see how good it feels to take charge of your health .			1
