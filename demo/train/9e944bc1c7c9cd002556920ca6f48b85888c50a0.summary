-- you are told -- twice -- that your son has died , once by a state trooper and then again by a local police officer			1
what do you do ? express thanks , and perhaps frustration , that it 's not true			0
an @entity10 family rode this emotional roller coaster earlier this week			2
and on friday , @entity12 -- the man whose parents believed had died -- said his family is " very private , " but hopes some good comes from getting the story out so no one else has to endure a similar nightmare ride			1
" we wanted to put a little pressure on the police department to make sure this sort of thing does n't happen again , " @entity12 said			2
" and i think we achieved our goal			0
" it is true that @entity27 was pronounced dead at the scene late wednesday after the car he was driving slammed into a tree in @entity31 , police announced in a news release			1
two other passengers in his vehicle were injured , including one " with apparent life - threatening injuries			0
" when something horrible like this happens , law enforcement officers have the unenviable job of notifying next of kin			0
so , @entity31 police reached out to the @entity44 , trying to get information on a @entity12 from his parents in @entity47 to determine if their son was in @entity31 at the time of the accident			1
" instead , ... the communication got mixed up , " @entity31 police chief @entity51 said			1
" we somehow communicated it wrong , and they thought that we wanted to tell the family that their son had died in the crash			2
" that 's what troopers did , going to the @entity63 home in @entity47 before dawn to relay the horrific news			2
then , @entity12 's father called @entity31 police to verify it was his son who died in the accident			1
a @entity31 officer said it was			2
but a different @entity12 had died , one who was 33 , as police noted in their press release , and from @entity31			1
the @entity12 whose parents were contacted is 29 , according to the @entity74 , and from south @entity75 , about 570 miles away by air or boat and 850 miles by car from @entity31			1
the parents of the 29 - year - old thought their son was dead when they went to his house early thursday morning			1
they knocked on the door			0
and guess who answered , according to the @entity74 ? their son @entity84 , alive and well			0
" @entity84 ? " his father asked , the news website reported			0
" it 's @entity84 ! @entity90 , we thought you were dead			2
" the mixup got back to @entity31 later thursday			2
police there issued an updated press release , apologizing " for our error " and " for any anguish our mistake has caused			0
" @entity51 , @entity31 's police chief , talked directly to the living @entity12 's father by phone			1
" he told me what they went through , and i was left speechless , " said a choked up @entity51			0
" from my perspective , after hearing all that they did , i was talking to a great man			0
i was left with an immense amount of respect for him			0
" after this incident , @entity51 said @entity31 police would review its dispatch recordings , talk to officers about following procedures , and possibly change protocols if it makes sense			1
what the police chief is not doing is shirking blame for what happened			1
" it was our case , our responsibility , " @entity51 said			0
" ... the family deserves for us to acknowledge that it was our mistake , and we are sorry			0

a young man is *killed* in a car crash late wednesday in @entity31 , @entity10
state troopers , then @entity31 police tell @entity12 's parents he 's dead
news site : the parents go to their son 's house , and he opens the door
@entity31 police chief : " it was our mistake , and we are sorry "
