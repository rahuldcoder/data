@entity0 -- the military will phase out its " stop - loss " program , the contentious practice of holding troops beyond the end of their enlistments , for all but extraordinary situations , defense secretary @entity2 announced wednesday			1
@entity2 said the @entity11 will pay a $ 500 - per - month bonus to troops whose tours have been extended			2
@entity14 also announced at a wide - ranging news conference that the @entity11 will pay for families of fallen troops to travel to @entity18 in @entity19 to be present for the return of their deceased family members			1
the decision to phase out stop loss by 2011 comes in combination with an announcement that soldiers affected by the program will receive a $ 500 - a - month bonus while they are in extended service			1
currently , the @entity31 is the only service that uses the stop - loss program			1
as of january , 13,217 soldiers had tours extended under the stop - loss policy			1
@entity2 said the change is one he has wanted to implement since he became secretary of defense			1
" while these changes do carry some risk , i believe it is important that we do everything possible to see that soldiers are not unnecessarily forced to stay in the @entity31 beyond their end - of - term - of - service date , " @entity2 said			1
the stop - loss program was put in place to ensure units remained intact during deployment			1
for those whose enlistment was due to end , tours of duty could be extended in the middle of their unit 's deployment			0
the @entity31 used the stop - loss policy during @entity61 in 1990 and reinstated it after the september 11 , 2001 , attacks			1
@entity2 cited two factors as contributing to the end of the program			2
first , he said , " we will be drawing down in @entity67 , over the next 18 or 19 months , significantly more than we are building up in @entity68 , in terms of the @entity31			0
" in addition , the @entity31 has more troops to call on			0
retention and enlistment are up , @entity2 said , and the service has reached its goal of 547,000 personnel sooner than expected			2
the defense secretary would not talk about details of the @entity80 's review of @entity68 strategy , being conducted by the @entity11 , @entity82 and the @entity80 , but he did said it has not been easy coming up with a promising new strategy			1
" it 's a difficult problem and trying to come up with new approaches and new initiatives that enhance our prospects for success is hard work , " he explained			0
he admitted that he has been " uncertain " about the proper direction for the @entity68 strategy			0
" i 've been very concerned about an open - ended commitment of increasing numbers of troops for a variety of reasons , including the size of our footprint in @entity68 , and my worry that the @entity68 come to see us as not their partners and allies , but as part of their problem , " @entity2 told reporters			2
@entity2 defended the continued hunt for @entity109 , and suggested the expectation that @entity109 could be easily found is unrealistic			1
" i think too many people go to too many movies			0
finding these guys is really hard , especially if they have some kind of a support network , " @entity2 said			2
" we have , i think , done some serious damage to @entity118 over the last number of months			0
and everybody continues to look for number one and number two			0
" @entity2 also announced he is recommending to the president that he renominate adm. @entity124 for a second term as chairman of the @entity127 and gen. @entity128 as vice chairman			0
the announcement about funding the trips to @entity18 comes as the @entity11 prepares to allow the media to record the return of fallen troops from overseas , if the families of the troops permit it			1
the media has been prevented from doing so since 1989			0
" we are committed to seeing that @entity140 's fallen heroes are received back to their loved ones and their country with the honor , respect and recognition that they and their families have earned , " @entity2 said			2
he briefly talked about his own trip to @entity18 earlier this week , getting emotional as he described going to the back of the plane carrying the coffins			0
" i went to the back of the plane by myself and spent time with each of the transfer cases , " he said , his voice beginning to choke up			0
" i think i 'll stop there			0
