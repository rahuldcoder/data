-- on tuesday morning , the @entity1 killed a regulation that is key to making @entity4 work			1
its decision in @entity6 v. @entity7 , if it were the last word on the matter , would have significant -- and damaging -- consequences for millions of @entity10 who purchase health insurance on exchanges established and run by the federal government			1
fortunately , it wo n't be the last word on the matter			0
and the decision issued later tuesday by another federal appellate court -- the @entity18 -- in @entity19 v. @entity7 makes clear why : the @entity1 's decision got basically everything wrong			1
it misunderstood the text , structure and purpose of the @entity4			1
the @entity26 has already indicated that it will ask the entire @entity1 to review the @entity28 decision , and when it does , it will no doubt reverse it			1
these two cases are both part of what judge @entity31 , the dissenting judge in @entity32 , termed a " not - so - veiled attempt to gut " the @entity4			1
as the members of @entity38 who led the enactment of the law made clear in a " friend of the court " brief they submitted to both courts this year , the fundamental purpose of the statute was to achieve universal health care coverage , and the @entity46 providing tax credits that act as subsidies so low - and middle - income @entity10 can pay for health care is central to doing so			1
the plaintiffs in these challenges argue that these tax credits should not be available to people who buy insurance in the 36 states with exchanges operated by the federal government -- that is , who got their subsidized health coverage through @entity61 , not a state - run exchange			2
it 's a position that 's not only completely without legal merit -- " tortured " and " nonsensical , " according to one of the @entity18 judges -- it 's also one that would critically undermine how @entity4 works			1
what the @entity4 court decisions mean for you but rather than looking at the law as a whole and considering what it was attempting to accomplish , the @entity1 judges focused on one small provision of what is a long and complicated statute			1
@entity31 called the plaintiffs ' argument " illogical when cast in the context of the statute as a whole			0
" indeed , the plaintiffs themselves appeared to recognize how flawed their argument , based on the statute 's language , was and thus manufactured an explanation for why @entity38 would have written the statute to eliminate the tax credits on federally facilitated exchanges			2
according to the plaintiffs , @entity38 wanted to encourage the states to set up their own exchanges			0
the only problem , as @entity31 noted , is that the " claim is nonsense , made up out of whole cloth			0
" the legal reasoning in the majority 's opinion is so weak it is difficult to understand it as anything but a political decision			2
and that is what makes particularly galling the judges ' professed " reluctance " to reach their conclusion			0
these judges assert that their hands were tied by the " limited " role of judges in our democratic system			0
in other words , they imply , their decision -- which could have massive consequences for millions of @entity10 -- was actually an exercise of judicial restraint			2
appeals courts differ on @entity4 there 's nothing restrained about misreading a law 's text , disregarding its structure and ignoring its purpose			1
in fact , it was the @entity18 judges who exercised true judicial restraint			2
two of those judges concluded that the statute was unclear and that they should therefore defer to the agencies charged with implementing the law -- in this case , the @entity46 , which would provide the tax credit subsidies			0
( the other judge concluded that the statute is unambiguous , but in the other direction , and requires that tax credits be available on federally facilitated exchanges			0
) as those judges recognized , where a law is unclear , the proper role of a judge is generally to defer to a reasonable construction offered by the executive branch agencies charged with implementing the statute			0
the judges in @entity32 seemed so determined to undermine the @entity4 that they ignored this bedrock legal principle			0
fortunately , they wo n't have the last word on the subject .			0

@entity158 : @entity1 panel got it wrong by dealing blow to how @entity4 works
she says *4th* @entity18 ruling was right and that both challenges part of right 's attempt to gut law
@entity1 ruled against federal subsidies for millions signed up , ignoring law 's intent , she says
@entity158 : review of decision by entire @entity1 will likely reverse flawed decision
