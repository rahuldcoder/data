attorneys for @entity2 teen @entity1 claimed that his " affluenza " meant he was blameless for driving drunk and causing a crash that left four people dead in june			1
simply put , @entity1 , 16 , claims that his condition stemmed from having wealthy , privileged parents who never set limits for him			1
judge @entity11 sentenced him tuesday to 10 years of probation but no jail time , saying she would work to find him a long - term treatment facility			0
but @entity15 , who lost his wife and daughter in the crash , said on @entity20 's " @entity19 360 , " " there are absolutely no consequences for what occurred that day			1
the primary message has to absolutely be that money and privilege ca n't buy justice in this country			0
" is " affluenza " real ? or is it a way for coddled children and adolescents to evade consequences for their actions ? not surprisingly , " affluenza " does not appear in the @entity36 , or @entity36 , the " psychiatric @entity37			2
" video : @entity39 : poverty in prison cures affluenza but the term highlights the issue of parents , particularly upper - middle - class ones , who not only refuse to discipline their children but may protest the efforts of others -- school officials , law enforcement and the courts -- who attempt to do so , said @entity55 , a professor of psychology at @entity57			1
" there are families where very , very few limits are set at a time when they should be , " she said			1
by age 16 , she noted , it 's too late : " the horse is out of the barn			2
" the diagnosis for youths in such situations would be impulse control problems , said @entity73 psychologist @entity72 -- and impulse control problems are seen across all socioeconomic levels in families where limits are n't set			1
" we do n't know if the rates of poor limit - setting are higher in affluent families or not , " @entity78 said , noting that there has not been a lot of research			0
@entity55 says she has studied wealthier families , however , and " we 've found the level of serious adjustment problems ranging from depression , anxiety , delinquency , substance abuse higher among kids of upper - middle - class families			0
" she says in one of her studies , her team gave youths several different scenarios , ranging from minor to serious infractions -- such as being caught for the third time with vodka at school or plagiarizing on a test -- and asked them how likely their parents would be to protest any punishment for them			2
" there was definitely a subgroup of kids that said , ' my parents would object ( to punishment from school officials ) , ' " she said			2
however , she points out that this is not the norm			0
" it 's a small group ( of parents ) but very vocal , aggressive , entitled			1
... there is definitely a small subgroup that is powerful and way off the charts			0
" " i would n't say there 's worse parenting in affluent families and fewer limits set , " @entity78 said			1
" that 's not true			2
" but in wealthy families , @entity78 said , " kids without limits have a lot more resources to use for their impulsive behavior			1
they have a lot more money and a lot more access to powerful cars that are fast ; to drugs and alcohol , because those things cost money			0
so the extra resources that you have to live out your impulse control problems really create a problem			0
" both she and @entity55 pointed out that affluent families also have the means to afford things like quality defense attorneys and treatment for their children			0
and , says @entity78 , children in affluent families may not have jobs and may have more free time			0
blame it on ' affluenza , ' rich kid syndrome the day of the crash , @entity15 ' wife , @entity159 , and daughter @entity158 had left their home to help @entity164 , whose suv had a flat tire			1
youth pastor @entity167 also stopped to help			0
all four died when @entity1 's pickup plowed into them			2
the vehicle also struck a parked car , which slid into another vehicle coming the opposite way			0
two people riding in the bed of @entity1 's pickup sustained severe injuries			2
earlier that day , @entity1 and some friends had stolen beer from a local @entity179			0
three hours after the crash , @entity1 's blood alcohol level was 0.24 , three times the legal limit for someone of legal drinking age , according to prosecutors			1
" there are ways in a society that we collectively shape the behavior of our kids , " meaning parents , school officials and law enforcement , @entity55 says			1
" if you find the parents are not imposing limits themselves but fighting consequences ... then obviously , the child is going to continue whatever , " she said			1
" you keep upping the ante			0
" and unless a child faces consequences , their actions are " likely to mushroom			1
" " it really speaks to the importance of attending to our children 's behavior early on , " she said			1
" in all cases , it is the duty of us ... to step in and do the right thing			0
it 's not just loving our kids but putting the appropriate limits " on their behavior			1
@entity78 says she understands why @entity1 's sentencing left some outraged but agrees with the judge that he should be in treatment			2
" i can understand how people would be angry , if 16 - year - olds from less affluent families are sentenced to juvenile detention and not treatment , " she said			0
" all teenagers who act out should actually have access to therapeutic resources , " although not all of them do			0
@entity55 says she does n't like to blame children for their actions			0
but on " affluenza , " she notes : " if you have a child who grew up in the inner city , and the parents abused crack , and ( the child ) was abused all along and grew up at the age of 16 and ran over four people , how likely is it the public or culture would say , ' you must understand , what the child did was a result of his upbringing ' ? " it is hard to justify such vastly different approaches taken toward inner - city children versus those in affluence			1

a @entity2 teen claims " affluenza " rendered him blameless in a fatal @entity256 crash
some parents refuse to set limits , a psychologist says
those parents may resist efforts of others to discipline their child
without appropriate limits , a child 's behavior will " mushroom , " she says
