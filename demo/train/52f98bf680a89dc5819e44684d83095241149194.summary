-- when the @entity3 " long count " calendar ends on friday , december 21 , some people predict it could mark the end of the world as we know it			1
but despite the attention that december 21 is garnering , many apocalyptic believers do n't actually give much thought to the hype surrounding the @entity3 calendar			1
some doomsday believers pinpointed 2012 as a pretty good year for disastrous solar flares , giant asteroids or global pole shifts that could likewise signal the apocalypse			1
other theories that may or may not happen this year involve the @entity19 , the catastrophic collapse of civilization or even a zombie uprising			1
there is diversity among apocalyptic " prepper " groups , and to paint them all with a broad stroke of the crazy brush is to ignore the nuances in what these various groups believe			2
@entity32 , author of " apocalypse : from @entity38 to the @entity39 , " said groups organized around 2012 end - of - world predictions -- driven by pseudoscientific or numerological predictions -- are " more fanciful " than some other doomsday believers			1
that 's because they look toward dramatic external events , as opposed to others that approach theories with a " fair amount of scientific basis , " such as the disappearance of natural resources			1
read more : the apocalypse , by the numbers although @entity32 and his colleagues have spent years trying to define or connect them , the groups can be as hard to explain as their disparate beliefs			1
" it 's not like a pie of apocalyptic stories that can be divided up so much as it is a story where people coming from many different places can ... express the urgency of the crisis they foresee , " @entity32 said			2
for instance , @entity32 said the survivalists -- both those of the fundamentalist religious persuasion and the nonreligious -- are looking to opt out of post-apocalyptic strife			2
that analysis applies to @entity69 , a survivalist living off the grid and author of " apocalypse : how to survive a @entity73 , " a book that teaches skills for living a self - sufficient life after what he perceives to be an oncoming collapse of civilization and governments			1
he said his readers are " normal middle - class " soccer moms and teachers who read about world events and " connect the dots			1
" " most of my readers are n't die - hard , end - of - the - world subscribers or enthusiasts , " he said			1
" they do n't want things to change , but are n't ignorant to the fact that they most likely will within our own lifetime , so preparing for such a strong possibility is n't desperation or ignorance or naivety , it 's just another insurance policy			2
" insofar as civilization 's collapse is something we 're bringing upon ourselves with a little help from world powers , @entity69 and his readers might relate to radical environmentalists or peak oil environmentalists , who subscribe to the theory that there is a date when petroleum production will max out and decline rapidly			1
debunking doomsday : 6 rumors dispelled @entity32 sees a connection between the survivalists and religious rapturists who " look at themselves as missing out on the agonies of the apocalypse because they 're going someplace else			1
" @entity123 , co-author of the " @entity130 " book series about the rapture within the @entity128 's end - of - days @entity126 , does n't completely agree with @entity32 's assessment			2
he said the media has incorrectly portrayed his readers as triumphalists who boast " we 're going , you 're not , too bad for you			0
" the whole point of the " @entity130 " books , @entity123 said , was to encourage people to read the @entity126 prophecies because religious rapturists want all people to have a better life in heaven			0
" [ we 're not ] saying ' good ' people go and ' bad ' people are left behind , " said @entity123 , who believes the key to being raptured ( or taken into heaven before the @entity72 happens on @entity144 ) is to receive @entity145			0
but @entity123 added that even those " looking forward to being rescued " are still dedicated to improving life for everyone on terra firma before they go			0
interestingly , @entity123 said @entity145 himself said he did n't even know the day or hour of the @entity19 , so the ilk of christian radio broadcaster @entity155 who attempt to predict its timing are " crazies " engaged in folly that " make us all look like idiots			0
" @entity155 claimed he was able to use the @entity128 to calculate the exact date of the @entity19 ( most recently it was supposed to be may 23 , 2011 , and before that in 1994 )			0
those who point to science instead of @entity128 lore to predict the @entity168 are another apocalyptic subculture , according to @entity32			1
these groups are comprised of theoretical physicists and futurologists -- such as @entity173 -- whom @entity32 calls " optimistic utopian prophets			0
" these people believe in the @entity177 theory : the possibility that technologically augmented intelligence will change human life as we know it or possibly wipe it out completely			0
there 's even a think tank of sorts formed around this logic			0
the @entity186 is comprised of scientists , philosophers and philanthropists from places such as the @entity191 and @entity192 , and universities such as @entity194 and @entity195 , said @entity196 , media director at @entity197			0
their goal ? constructing a smarter - than - human intelligence that has the values of humanity			0
instead of avoiding the growth of artificial intelligence , the @entity186 is trying to manage the risk			0
if peak oil theorists believe we 're rapidly running out of a major resource , the institute postulates that technology itself is advancing so rapidly that society will have an overabundance of it -- and an artificial intelligence is set to emerge that will not necessarily pursue mankind 's best interests			2
" we do think it 's possible , if not probable , that it could actually lead to either the marginalization or end of humanity , " said @entity196			0
doomsday dining : your last meal whereas religious and scientific apocalyptic subcultures converge and diverge on various points , there is one end - of - world scenario that manages to reflect all their anxieties : the zombie apocalypse			1
the zombocalypse of popular culture has become something of a @entity235 test of apocalyptic fears			0
depending on the point of view , zombies may result from an act of @entity241 , the irresponsible use of science , an environmental disaster , a cosmic event and so forth			1
@entity246 , author of " the @entity247 " and a member of the advisory board of the @entity250 , said the zombie apocalypse can represent a validation of sorts for people awaiting their particular extinction event			2
@entity32 agreed that the pop - culture connection of zombies to apocalyptic groups is " a shared motif of a dystopian world emerging			1
" he added that zombies are a stand - in for " @entity262 , " an alien group , process or force that is " almost always " the basis for apocalyptic developments			2
zombies can be a substitute for a corrupt government , an oil - based economy , foreigners or even a @entity274 society itself			1
" [ @entity275 ] ow you deal with the threat is an open question , " he said			0
whatever route to the end ( or new beginning ) , @entity32 thinks the very diversity of subcultures underscores the fact that we have reached an apocalyptic apex			0
" in this moment , people are seeing the old ways of life recede , " he said			0
" that 's the occasion when all kinds of different people from all kinds of different directions come forward with one or another apocalyptic scenario			0
" like @entity296 on @entity297 do you have a prediction for how the world will end ? share it in the comments section below .			2

a few think the world ends when the @entity3 calendar peters out friday , december 21
apocalypse theories can be rooted in science , religion or simply a notion
other theories involve governmental *failure* , a waning oil supply and zombies
