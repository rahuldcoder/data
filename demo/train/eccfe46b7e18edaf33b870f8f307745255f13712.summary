@entity4 's theatrical over-reaction has resulted in @entity3 suspending him for two matches			1
the incident occurred when the @entity17 side beat @entity5 2 - 1 in @entity18			0
a fan ran onto the field in the 90th minute , soon after the home side scored their winning goal , and made what appeared to be minimal contact with @entity4			1
the @entity5 goalkeeper turned to chase the supporter before dropping to the ground			1
he was carried off the field on a stretcher and replaced			0
@entity4 's theatrical over-reaction has cost him severely -- but @entity2 may choose not to complain about their own punishment , with half of their fine suspended for two years			1
@entity3 did have the power to change the result of the match , although that was always unlikely			0
