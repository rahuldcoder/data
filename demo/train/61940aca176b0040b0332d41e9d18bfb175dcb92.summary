today @entity5 is dead , and @entity1 has close to 100 million mobile phone lines , making it @entity8 's largest telecoms market , according to statistics by the @entity10			1
across the rest of the continent the trends are similar : between 2000 and 2010 , @entity15 mobile phone firm @entity14 saw its subscriber base increase in excess of 500-fold			1
in 2010 alone the number of mobile phone users in @entity20 grew by 50 % , figures from the country 's regulatory agency show			1

today the next frontier for mobile use in @entity8 is the internet			2
" @entity37 is fast becoming the @entity38 , " says @entity31 , market coordinator for @entity8 at @entity33 firm @entity32 , whose mobile browser is enjoying an impressive uptake on the continent			1
" in fact there is n't really anything more personal than a mobile phone nowadays			1
" last october , for the first time ever , the number of @entity1 accessing the internet via their mobiles surpassed the number of desktop internet users , figures from @entity51 show			2
the trend has continued since then			0
most of those devices will be low - end @entity56 phones , tens of millions of which have already been sold on the continent			0
the more expensive " smartphones " are however also increasing in popularity , as prices drop			0
@entity63 's market share has been rising in the developing world , bucking the trend in @entity66 and @entity67			2
@entity70 , for its part , plans to sell 200 million of its @entity72 phones in @entity8 and it is estimated that by 2016 there will be a billion mobile phones on the continent			1
in 2007 , president of @entity20 , @entity78 , said : " in 10 short years , what was once an object of luxury and privilege , the mobile phone , has become a basic necessity in @entity8			1
" watch video from @entity15 on how mobile has changed @entity8 below are seven ways that mobile phones have transformed the continent : banking @entity91 is a mobile money transfer service launched by @entity14 , @entity15 's largest mobile operator and @entity93 , in 2007			1
five years later @entity91 provides services to 15 million @entity15 ( more than a third of the population ) and serves as conduit for a fifth of the country 's gdp			0
in @entity15 , @entity103 and @entity104 half or more of adults used mobile money , according to a survey by the @entity107 and the @entity108			0
