@entity3 does n't like labels			1
but she is wrong to run away from her blackness , seemingly hoping that no one acknowledges her beautiful brown skin and the history written all over her face			1
" i 'm tired of being labeled			2
i 'm not an @entity11			2
" the former star of " @entity14 " and " that 's so @entity3 " told @entity15			1
" i mean , i do n't know where my roots go to			2
i do n't know how far back they go			2
... i do n't know what country in @entity19 i 'm from , but i do know that my roots are in @entity20			2
i 'm an @entity10 , and that 's a colorless person , because we 're all people			1
i have lots of things running through my veins			2
" many of us have been exactly where she is , struggling to fit in			2
trying to be " colorless " when there 's no way to look at someone without noticing appearance			0
but @entity35 's dilemma is part of the black experience in @entity38			1
our identity is not really a matter of choice			0
black people were forefathers of this nation : slaves , soldiers , scholars and dedicated women and men who helped create these @entity10			1
for me , rejecting your blackness is downright un-american			0
the two words are inseparable			0
being black equals being @entity10			1
so no matter how she tries to deny us , @entity35 is still ours , still black in the eyes of her community			1
and we remain proud of her			0
proud and patient because we understand how the heavy burden of labels can crush your spirit and get in the way of your dreams			1
i 've struggled all my life with the weight of labels			1
they pop up at the most awkward times : introductions at work meetings , compliments over dinner , amongst friends and foes			0
sometimes it feels like society is at once confused , intrigued and resentful of my blackness			0
and i 'm certain that black woman are described with more adjectives than anyone on the planet : black woman , @entity11 , bossy , strong black woman , articulate black woman , working mother , black entrepreneur , black single mother , straight ally , @entity92 - friendly , divorcee , feminist , liberal and now even black - ish woman			1
when i was younger it was a latchkey kid , project kid , kid from a broken home			0
one of my favorite is @entity99			0
the first time i visited @entity38 and heard a local call me that name , i immediately went into my @entity104 mode			0
it took a few minutes to calm down and understand that in @entity106 , @entity99 is a term of endearment , a compliment meaning something closer to beautiful black woman			1
who knew ? there 's even a national holiday in @entity115 called " @entity116 ­ a @entity117			1
" " i bet your country would never have a holiday honoring black women , " a friend in @entity115 joked one day , when i asked her why everyone was celebrating			1
no , i had to agree			0
we are a long way from that day			0
i 'm not sure when this notion first clicked for me , that you can not be black in this nation without also claiming your @entity10 - ness			1
maybe it was years ago after my great - aunt @entity131 showed me a photo in our family album of one of my ancestors gallantly posed in his @entity137 uniform			0
that soldier was a black @entity10			1
or , when my aunt talked with pride about her father who could n't read or write in any language but was a successful @entity144 chef in the @entity145			0
that chef was a black @entity10			1
or , perhaps things became clear when my grandfather stood tall and told me about how proud he was to fight for his country , despite segregation			0
now , @entity150 was n't a fancy , highly educated man			0
he never could imagine the glamorous @entity153 lifestyle of @entity3			1
truth be told , he was in slightly in awe of my career in " this journalism stuff			0
" unfortunately , he died before seeing a black family in the @entity159			2
now that would have really tickled him			0
but @entity150 always believed hard work and education could get you places in this world			0
he spent his life toiling in the bowels of our nation 's first @entity169 submarines , fitting those vessels with nuclear missiles			0
he would take me to tour those subs and boast about @entity38 's global power			0
he retired after nearly 50 years with a broken body but a proud heart for doing his part to keep @entity38 strong			2
my grandfather was a black @entity10			1
no matter what label the world may choose to describe me , one thing i never doubt is that i am a strong black @entity10 woman , whose heart beats with the @entity19 and @entity189 blood of my ancestors			1
knowing this gives me strength , courage and joy every day of my life			2
i can not imagine ever separating myself from all of the courageous people who came before me to break down barriers , share their wisdom and pave the way so my journey is just a little bit smoother in this life			0
and in spite of her protests when @entity35 looks back just a bit , she 'll understand : she is also , among other things , a black @entity10 .			1

@entity3 hates labels and wants to be called @entity10 , not black @entity10
@entity211 says @entity3 is wrong : being black equals being @entity10
@entity214 identified strongly as a strong black @entity10 woman , and it gives her courage
@entity214 says black @entity10 should not separate themselves from those who went before
