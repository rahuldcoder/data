@entity0 -- call it domestic housekeeping , a political dotting of " i " s and crossing of " t " s on a checklist for launching punitive military strikes against @entity8 for last week 's chemical weapons attack			2
the @entity11 administration briefed members of @entity13 late thursday in a display of consultation intended to fulfill a murky obligation under law and address the inevitable complaints by minority legislators that no one ever talks to them			1
officials including secretary of state @entity23 , defense secretary @entity24 , national security adviser @entity25 , director of national intelligence @entity26 and the vice chairman of the joint chiefs of staff were among those on the 90 - minute telephone conference call , the @entity21 said in a statement			1
" the views of @entity13 are important to the president 's decision - making process , and we will continue to engage with members as the president reaches a decision on the appropriate @entity41 response to the @entity8 government 's violation of international norms against the use of chemical weapons , " it read			1
a lawmaker on the call said that its main message was that the administration has no doubt the @entity8 government used chemical weapons			0
no decision has been made yet on military action , and there is no time table , the lawmaker said			1
@entity59 reportedly stressed that both action and inaction on @entity8 carry risk and consequence			2
" tonight the administration informed us that they have a ' broad range of options ' for @entity8 but failed to layout a single option			0
they also did not provide a timeline , a strategy for @entity8 and the @entity75 , or a plan for the funds to execute such an option , " said sen. @entity69 , @entity70 after the call			0
rep. @entity79 , @entity80 , warned that the @entity41 " can not be the lone sheriff of the whole world			0
" " the @entity41 must be careful in how it proceeds and must act together with a coalition of countries , " he said			0
while informal briefings and phone calls have taken place this week , the latest sessions with congressional leaders and others represent an official effort to lobby support while meeting an imprecise obligation under @entity41 law			0
does @entity13 need to give blessing ? the @entity97 passed by @entity13 in 1973 requires that the president seek consent from @entity13 before force is used , or within 60 days of the start of hostilities			2
it also says the president must provide @entity13 with reports throughout the conflict			2
since 1973 , the @entity41 has used military force in @entity108 in 1983 , @entity109 in 1989 , @entity110 in 1991 , @entity111 in 1994 and @entity112 in 1999			0
in all those instances , presidents -- both democrats and @entity115 -- sidestepped @entity13 and committed @entity41 military forces without obtaining congressional approval			1
@entity13 did , however , provide president @entity119 with its approval for the war in @entity110 in 2002 and the war in @entity123 after the september 11 , 2001 , terror attacks			1
now , @entity21 @entity115 lead the calls for president @entity11 to convene a joint session of @entity13 to lay out his case to the lawmakers and the @entity41 people			1
some in both parties demand a vote before any military strikes occur			0
more than 90 members of @entity13 , most of them @entity115 , have signed a letter to the president urging him " to consult and receive authorization " before authorizing any such military action , according to the office of @entity115 rep. @entity139 of @entity140			1
meanwhile , 54 @entity21 @entity114 mostly representing the party 's progressive wing sent @entity11 a letter thursday that said " we strongly urge you to seek an affirmative decision of @entity13 prior to committing any @entity41 military engagement to this complex crisis			1
" however , others acknowledge the reality that @entity11 has the authority to order limited attacks on @entity8 without first asking permission			2
what next in @entity8 : 5 lessons from @entity110 @entity155 : @entity11 can act without congressional approval veteran @entity115 sen. @entity155 of @entity157 expressed the prevailing view when he said @entity11 should consult with @entity13 first , but nothing legally required him to get approval before launching missiles at @entity8 in response to what @entity41 officials call a major chemical weapons attack by the regime of president @entity167 that killed hundreds on august 21			1
" no , the president does not have to , " @entity155 told @entity168 on wednesday			0
" but he is required to consult with @entity13 , and it would be in his interests to consult with @entity13 , rather than acting in a unilateral fashion			1
" agreeing was @entity115 rep. @entity173 of @entity174 , who chairs the @entity175			2
" under the @entity97 , i do n't believe there has to be a vote , " @entity173 told @entity176 on thursday			0
he added that it would be both politically wise and follow the law to have full discussions with @entity13 , saying : " you have to have these discussions			2
you have to bring members in			0
i think the administration is obligated to do that			0
" so far , the administration has failed to properly meet its obligation to fully consult @entity13 , @entity173 said , describing its efforts as " trying to do it on the cheap			1
" at the @entity21 , spokesman @entity191 disagreed , saying the " robust consultations " cover a wide range of information , including classified briefings for some members of @entity13			1
" it involves some insight into the perspective of our diplomatic partners around the globe , " he said			0
" it involves reading out conversations that the president and others have had with our allies			0
it involves a review of the options that are available to the president as he considers an appropriate response			0
" along with the congressional briefings , the administration is expected to publicly release a declassified intelligence report this week on what happened in @entity8			0
the @entity21 has made clear that the report would come out before any @entity41 action occurs			1
@entity221 debate arises again around possible action in @entity8 @entity223 seeks " clear , unambigous explanation " at home , polls show @entity41 are conflicted over the @entity41 intention to respond in @entity8			0
while national polling over the past few months suggests most @entity41 do n't favor military involvement in @entity8 , some surveys indicate the public feels @entity0 would be justified in using military action against @entity233 in the event of chemical weapons attacks by the regime			1
for almost two years , @entity11 has avoided direct military involvement in @entity8 's civil war , only escalating aid to rebel fighters in june after suspected smaller - scale chemical weapons attacks by @entity8 government forces			1
however , last week 's attack obliterated the " red line " @entity11 set just over a year ago against the use of @entity8 's chemical weapons stocks			2
the @entity41 has concluded @entity8 carried out chemical weapons attacks against its people , @entity11 said wednesday			2
" if , in fact , we can take limited , tailored approaches , not getting drawn into a long conflict , not a repetition of , you know , @entity110 , which i know a lot of people are worried about - but if we are saying in a clear and decisive but very limited way , we send a shot across the bow saying , stop doing this , that can have a positive impact on our national security over the long term , " the president told " @entity266			0
" opinion : on @entity8 , learn from @entity41 mistakes in @entity110 calls for a role in the decision - making process appear motivated both by the incessant grappling to shift @entity0 's power balance and the general public distaste for more war after more than a decade of conflict in @entity123 and @entity110			0
in a letter to @entity11 on wednesday , house speaker @entity223 called on the president to " provide a clear , unambiguous explanation of how military action -- which is a means , not a policy -- will secure @entity41 objectives and how it fits into your overall policy " regarding @entity8			1
" i respectfully request that you , as our country 's commander - in - chief , personally make the case to the @entity41 people and @entity13 for how potential military action will secure @entity41 national security interests , preserve @entity41 's credibility , deter the future use of chemical weapons , and , critically , be a part of our broader policy and strategy , " @entity223 's letter said			1
" in addition , it is essential you address on what basis any use of force would be legally justified and how the justification comports with the exclusive authority " of @entity13 to declare war under the @entity309 , the @entity300 @entity115 wrote			1
on thursday , @entity11 spoke by phone with @entity223 to brief him on @entity8 , according to the speaker 's spokesman , @entity311			2
@entity223 was also on the conference call thursday night			0
" it is clear that further dialogue and consultation with @entity13 , as well as communication with the @entity41 public , will be needed , " @entity311 said of @entity11			1
opinion : for @entity41 , @entity8 is truly a problem from hell @entity1 's @entity322 , @entity323 , @entity324 , @entity325 , @entity326 and @entity327 contributed to this report .			0
