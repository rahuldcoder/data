@entity3 did not post any reaction to monday 's decision on his @entity39 or @entity40 pages , which he often updates several times daily , and his representatives did not respond to @entity0 requests for comment			0
in his ruling , judge @entity44 ruled that @entity3 's assertions that he unfairly did n't have the right to due process " fail as a matter of law , and must be dismissed			1
" the judge also refused to side with the cyclist on his other claims , including that the @entity5 should not have jurisdiction in his case			1
he noted that federal law dictates that eligibility questions for cycling and other such sports should " be decided through arbitration , rather than federal lawsuits			0
" @entity3 , the judge pointed out , " has not exhausted his internal remedies , namely ... procedures in the @entity5 protocol			1
" " even if the @entity9 has jurisdiction over @entity3 's remaining claims , the @entity9 finds they are best resolved through the well - established system of international arbitration , by those with expertise in the field , rather than by the unilateral edict of a single nation 's courts , " stated @entity44 , a judge in the @entity8 district court based out of @entity67 , @entity68			1
@entity3 had filed a lawsuit against the @entity5 in july , only to have it thrown out a day later by @entity44			1

" @entity106 , or erythropoietin , boosts the number of red blood cells , which carry oxygen to the muscles			0
@entity3 is n't the only one challenging the @entity5 and its case			1
the @entity114 -- whom the @entity68 has said should be the arbiter in his case -- has opposed the @entity8 agency 's actions by claiming it has jurisdiction			0
that position has been recently backed by @entity122 , the official cycling organization recognized by the @entity123			0
@entity44 , the @entity8 federal judge , acknowledged " the appearance of conflict on the part of both organizations creates doubt the charges against @entity3 would receive fair consideration in either forum			2
" but that does n't mean @entity8 courts should intervene , the judge said , adding " these matters should be resolved internally , by the parties most affected			2
" " if these bodies wish to damage the image of their sport through bitter infighting , they will have to do so without the involvement of the @entity8 courts , " @entity44 said			0
@entity3 has been dogged by allegations of drug abuse in recent years , with compatriot @entity145 -- who was found guilty of doping in the @entity146 , resulting in him being stripped of the title -- making a series of claims last year			2

in the @entity153 interview , @entity155 -- who retired in 2009 after twice testing positive himself and who , earlier this month , was stripped of his 2004 gold medal by the @entity158 due to doping -- said he first saw @entity3 use @entity106 in 1999			0
" i saw it in his refrigerator , " @entity155 said			0
" i saw him inject it more than one time like we all did , like i did many , many times			0
" the latest lawsuit filed by @entity3 , and dismissed monday , claimed that @entity3 has n't had " a single positive test " in the 500 to 600 drug tests he 's taken in his over two decades in cycling			2
in february , @entity172 prosecutors said they closed a criminal investigation after reviewing allegations against @entity3			0
they had called witnesses to a federal grand jury in @entity177 , but they apparently determined they lacked evidence to bring a charge that @entity3 used performance - enhancing drugs			1
