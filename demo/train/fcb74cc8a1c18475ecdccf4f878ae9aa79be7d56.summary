-- @entity2 stars @entity3 and @entity4 are free to play again after their bans for testing positive for a prohibited stimulant were scrapped			1
the pair were charged after @entity9 's test match against @entity10 in @entity11 back in november 2010 after testing positive for a substance known as @entity13 ( @entity14 )			1
@entity3 and @entity4 were immediately banned from rugby and sent home from the tour			1
the supplement was supplied to them by the @entity21 medical team			2
but at a hearing in @entity25 , their advocate @entity22 successfully challenged the ban on the basis that @entity14 had been downgraded by the @entity28 ( @entity28 )			0
@entity3 told the official @entity2 ( @entity2 ) website : " finally the facts are out there and people can see that we were not guilty and are not doping cheats , " he said			2
" we were only doing what the large majority of professional rugby players around the world do by using a supplement			2
" @entity4 and i were the unlucky ones to be tested on the day and to have had to go through the trauma of the past two - and - a - half months			0
we 're both now just looking forward to playing again and closing this chapter once and for all			0
" the @entity21 team , known as the @entity9 , has now changed its approach to supplements and will not be issuing any to team members			1
the chief executive of @entity50 added : " this verdict completely quashes any idea that either the players or the team were guilty of any attempt to cheat			0
no responsibility attaches to the players at all			0
" the banned stimulant was in a supplement given to the players in the warm - up before the test against @entity10 and is a product that has been used by the @entity9 before -- without any adverse analytical findings -- and is used by other professional and national teams in both hemispheres			1
" that the players subsequently tested positive for a banned stimulant was an enormous shock to the @entity9 team , management and to @entity2 and i am most sorry that the players have had to endure the stress and stigma attached to a failed dope test			1
" hopefully this verdict will have laid to rest any idea of any wrong doing on their part			0

@entity3 and @entity4 free to play rugby for @entity9 again
pair have their bans for testing positive for a banned stimulant quashed
the supplement was given to them by the @entity21 team 's medical *department*
@entity3 says he is *pleased* the case is over and that he has been cleared
