ever feel like that laundry pile never gets smaller or the kitchen never stays clean , especially when children are around ? @entity5 mother @entity4 knows the feeling well thanks to 15 - month - old @entity7			1
whenever she turns her back on a neatly folded stack of clothing or a dust pile it 's only a matter of seconds before @entity7 steps in , sending her mother back to square one			1
rather than despair , @entity14 decided to make light of those moments by turning them into an 1:21 video delighting viewers worldwide			1
since being posted on her @entity23 page last wednesday , the video has been viewed more than 68 million times and shared from her page more than two million times			1
" i just wanted to show that this is part of life being a mom , " said @entity14 , who documents her adventures as a first - time mother on her blog , " @entity33			2
" " babies tear things up and take them apart ; they unravel your life			2
something would be wrong if they did n't			0
you would be a helicopter mom			0
" the idea for the video began in the laundry room			1
as @entity14 moved clothes from the washer to the dryer @entity7 intervened			0
@entity14 fetched her dslr camera , set it up in front of the machines and went back to work , letting @entity7 do her worst as she filmed the results			0
she repeated the process the next day in the kitchen			0
as she attempted to sweep the floor and unload the dishwasher , she indulged @entity7 's mischief longer than she normally would for the sake of the camera , and to prove a point : " at the end of the day you look at your house and it looks like you 've done nothing all day long			1
" but that 's ok			2
" moms around the world are dealing with the same stuff , " she said			0
" i think that 's why the video has been so popular			1
you do n't have to be @entity74 or speak @entity75 to know this is what kids do			0
" and , we love them anyway			0
