-- as the global population hits 7 billion in the coming days , nations can take steps to tackle critical challenges and prepare for the arrival of billions more people this century , the @entity1 said wednesday			1
the milestone is expected to be reached on october 31			0
" with planning and the right investments in people now ... our world of 7 billion can have thriving , sustainable cities , productive labor forces that can fuel economic growth , youth populations that contribute to the well - being of economies and societies , and a generation of older people who are healthy and actively engaged in the social and economic affairs of their communities , " @entity27 , the @entity27 , said in a new report			2
among the steps the report focuses on are empowering young people with economic opportunities ; planning for the growth of cities ; developing programs to share and sustain the @entity35 's resources ; and improving education , including sexual education			2
a @entity1 report published in may predicts a global population of 9.3 billion by 2050 , and more than 10 billion by the end of this century			1
" with only a small variation in fertility , particularly in the more populous countries , the total could be higher : 10.6 billion people could be living on @entity35 by 2050 and more than 15 billion in 2100 , " says the @entity41 of the @entity1 @entity42			1
much of the increase will come in @entity49 and @entity50			2
in light of growing concerns about the global economy , the new @entity27 report highlights financial dangers facing people in industrialized and developing nations			0
" while labor shortages threaten to stymie the economies of some industrialized countries , unemployed would - be migrants in developing countries are finding more and more national borders closed to them and the expertise they may have to offer			0
and while progress is being made in reducing extreme poverty , gaps between rich and poor are widening almost everywhere			0
" the 7 billion mark is a huge spike from less than a century ago			2
in 1927 , the global population was 2 billion			1
it was only 13 years ago that the population was at 6 billion , the @entity1 says			1
changing demographics are quickly reshaping the world in numerous ways			0
people under the age of 25 make up 43 % of the world 's population , the @entity1 says			1
about half of the world 's population lives in cities			1
within about 35 years , two - thirds will , it says			0
while reaching 7 billion in 2011 has long been predicted , the new @entity1 report wednesday -- " @entity83 " -- highlights changes and trends to offer a complex picture			2
in a summary of the report , the agency notes that " women are on average having fewer children than they were in the 1960s			0
" the number of children a woman is expected to have dropped from an average of 6 to 2.5 , the report says			0
but there are far more women than there were in the 1960s			0
" in some of the poorest countries , high fertility rates hamper development and perpetuate poverty , while in some of the richest countries , low fertility rates and too few people entering the job market are raising concerns about prospects for sustained economic growth and the viability of social security systems , " the summary says			0
a few more facts and figures from the report : -- today there are 893 million people over the age of 60 ; by the middle of the century , that number will rise to 2.4 billion			1
-- @entity50 will remain the most populous area this century , but @entity49 " will gain ground as its population more than triples , increasing from 1 billion in 2011 to 3.6 billion in 2100			1
" -- the combined population of other areas -- including the @entity129 , @entity130 , and @entity131 -- is currently 1.7 billion , and is expected to rise to nearly 2 billion by 2060 , " then decline very slowly			1
