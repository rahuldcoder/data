like most @entity1 , president @entity0 is tired of war			1
unlike most @entity1 , he just started another one			0
in launching his new campaign against @entity8 terrorists inside @entity9 and @entity10 , the @entity5 peace laureate acknowledged the engagement would n't be another @entity9 or @entity12			1
and a day after secretary of state @entity13 insisted the campaign is not a war , press secretary @entity16 on friday affirmed that the @entity1 is indeed " at war " with @entity18			1
but semantics aside , @entity0 is embarking upon a sustained military operation without an end date , price tag or clear definition of victory -- threatening his legacy as a war - ender and almost certainly dashing his goal of leaving the next commander in chief with a clean slate			1
" this effort will be different from the wars in @entity9 and @entity12 , " @entity0 insisted during his address to the nation on wednesday , noting no @entity1 troops were being sent in a combat role and a coalition of allied nations was joining the fight			1
but while @entity0 has broad public approval for his @entity18 mission , according to polls , the decision to engage the @entity1 military in @entity9 and @entity10 undercuts his image as a president opposed to war -- though describing him as a foreign policy " dove " was never truly accurate			1
during his campaign for president in 2008 , @entity0 made clear he opposed military engagements such as the the war in @entity9 , which he termed " dumb " and vowed to end			1
but he maintained there were times and places where @entity1 military engagement was necessary			0
when he accepted his @entity57 in 2009 -- awarded for fostering a " new climate " in international relations -- @entity0 admitted war was n't going to end under his presidency			1
" we must begin by acknowledging the hard truth : we will not eradicate violent conflict in our lifetimes , " he said then			0
" there will be times when nations -- acting individually or in concert -- will find the use of force not only necessary but morally justified			0
" in the six years he 's been president , that use of force has translated into a surge in drone strikes against suspected militants in countries like @entity77 , @entity78 and @entity79 -- the latter two examples @entity0 cited wednesday as models for his mission against @entity18			1
the drone campaign has infuriated civil libertarians and human rights advocates , who point to civilian casualties that often go unnoticed by the @entity1 public			2
but the strikes have allowed @entity0 to keep troops out of dangerous situations while mitigating terrorist threats			2
when he 's sent @entity1 personnel into danger , it 's been in small , tactical missions in the model of the raid that led to the killing of @entity100 leader @entity99			0
@entity0 attempted to sum up his policy during remarks at @entity103 last spring : " to say that we have an interest in pursuing peace and freedom beyond our borders is not to say that every problem has a military solution , " he said then			2
put more bluntly a few months earlier , @entity0 said he was n't interested taking a " swing at every pitch " that came his way			2
with his expansion of the mission in @entity9 , @entity0 seems to have seen a pitch he liked , making him the fourth president in a row to order an air campaign over the country			1
his goals there , analysts say , are distinct from @entity9 campaigns in the past			2
" i do not believe what he 's laid out in his speech or what he intends to do is transformative , " said @entity126 , a scholar at the @entity127 in @entity128 who 's worked for @entity131 and @entity132 administrations			0
" he 's not interested in nation - building			0
" while @entity0 may be setting out on a very different type of mission in @entity9 , vowing the @entity1			1
would n't " get dragged into another ground war " there , he 's nonetheless setting his successor up to carry on the mission			0
" he has clearly gotten pulled back in , " said @entity144 , a former adviser to four presidents and @entity147 analyst			0
" he 's a very reluctant warrior			0
he did n't want to do this			0
but it is good he recognized reality			0

despite broad public support , @entity0 's campaign against @entity18 undercuts his image as a president opposed to war
@entity0 hit the war in @entity9 as " dumb " while running for president , but was never viewed as a true foreign policy dove
@entity0 is now the fourth - *straight* president to order an air campaign over @entity9
