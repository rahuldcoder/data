-- @entity1 laid down their @entity3 title credentials with a ruthless 4 - 0 thrashing of 10 - man @entity5 in @entity7 on sunday			1
@entity9 attacker @entity8 was sent off for a dangerous tackle early in the second period when the score was 2 - 0			1
the result put @entity13 's injury - hit team top of @entity14 on goal difference from @entity16 , who earlier beat @entity18 1 - 0			1
a late penalty by @entity20 gave @entity16 a deserved victory in the opening group d match played in @entity23			1
@entity1 4 - 0 @entity5 forwards @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28 all scored for the three - time champions in the most one - sided match of the tournament so far			1
who 's creating a @entity33 ? " everything worked well and it is important that things went well in the first game , " @entity26 told @entity34			0
" we have earned some respect			0
you could see that we had fun playing football out there			0
" the @entity45 have reached at least the quarterfinal of each of the last seven @entity48 and appear destined for another successful tournament after a scintillating display			0
after @entity52 had given @entity1 an early scare , @entity13 's side almost went ahead when @entity26 was sent racing through on goal , but he fired his shot straight at @entity5 goalkeeper @entity56			1
moments later , @entity27 found space inside the box and pulled the ball back for @entity25 , who fired a first - time shot through the palms of @entity56 and into the roof of the net			2
@entity52 and @entity64 both had half chances for the @entity9 before @entity26 almost gave @entity1 a 2 - 0 lead			1
playmaker @entity67 , one of the game 's outstanding players , fed the ball to @entity25 , whose low cross was fired wastefully wide by the unmarked @entity26			2
but @entity26 did not have to wait long for his 11th goal in @entity3 finals			2
@entity74 whipped in a fine cross from the right and the @entity78 striker darted in ahead of @entity56 before planting his header into the top corner			0
@entity5 made a bright start to the second period and were denied a penalty when the ball appeared to strike the hand of @entity1 defender @entity85			2
moments later @entity86 worked some space for himself but dragged his left - footed shot wide			0
after 55 minutes , @entity5 were reduced to 10 men when @entity8 clattered into @entity90 and was shown a straight red card by @entity93 referee @entity92			2
that decision effectively ended the game as a contest and it was no surprise when @entity1 extended their lead , as @entity27 swivelled inside the area and planted a low shot off the inside of a post			2
@entity103 - born substitute @entity28 was the next to get on the scoresheet , turning in a low cross from @entity67			0
@entity13 's men cruised their way through the rest of the match to record their sixth straight victory in the opening game of a @entity3			1
@entity16 1 - 0 @entity18 striker @entity20 , who plays for @entity113 club @entity112 , emphatically converted the winner from the spot past @entity116 in the 84th minute to the obvious delight of the partisan crowd			1
the victory was the first by an @entity122 team at this year 's @entity3			0
@entity16 were awarded their penalty after @entity18 substitute @entity125 needlessly hand - balled a cross which looked to be drifting harmlessly out of his team 's penalty area			1
amid delirious celebrations of the @entity122 supporters in the @entity131 , @entity18 struggled to find an equalizer and it was @entity16 , the four - time @entity122 champions , who should have made it 2 - 0 before the final whistle			1
@entity16 -- popularly known as the @entity16 -- started the match at a high tempo and created chances throughout the match , never allowing the @entity18 defense to settle			2
this attacking pattern was set early on when @entity144 midfielder @entity143 volleyed the ball wide after two minutes and @entity16 's captain @entity146 headed a free kick wide of the far post in the 19th minute			0
@entity16 continued to press forward in the second half and came closest to scoring when @entity20 rose high above the @entity18 defense meeting a long throw from @entity151 , only to head the ball just wide of @entity116 's left post			1
@entity18 created fewer chances than their opponents but probably had the better opportunities to score			0
@entity0 's @entity158 blog the giant @entity18 striker @entity159 should have given his country the lead in the 58th minute when he met @entity163 's cross at the far post but his control let him down and the ball dribbled away to safety			0
and later , when @entity18 had been reduced to 10 men after @entity169 received his second yellow card in the 73rd minute , @entity18 squandered a fantastic opportunity to break the deadlock			0
striker , @entity173 broke away from @entity174 's @entity151 on the left goal - line and managed to cut the ball back into the middle of the area which @entity179 then struck fiercely at goalkeeper @entity180 , who parried the ball to safety			0
the resulting corner saw @entity185 's @entity184 narrowly head over the crossbar			0
@entity18 meet @entity1 next friday in @entity187 , while @entity16 play @entity5 in @entity188 on saturday .			1
