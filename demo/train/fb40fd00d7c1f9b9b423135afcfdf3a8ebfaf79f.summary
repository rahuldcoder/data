-- ever get the feeling the cops are driving a much cooler car than you ? @entity6 's @entity5 drove a @entity7 to match his famously disheveled detective persona			1
for decades drivers have seen police officers cruise past in supremely cool cars from supercharged @entity12 to upgraded @entity13 and beyond , while modern police units often consist of high - powered @entity15 and , in one incredible instance , a @entity17			1
cops or detectives portrayed on tv and in the movies are no different , often driving fatter rides than the drug - dealers they pursue			2
but which are the coolest cop rides of all time , real or fictional ? let 's take a look			2
@entity28 one of the original muscle cars favored by @entity31 moonshine and marijuana smugglers to outrun the boys in blue in the 1970s got a swift turnaround a couple years ago with @entity37 's earth - shattering introduction of the new charger , its @entity40 engine and its use by police forces across the nation			1
officers generally compare it favorably with standard @entity47 vehicles and laud its performance and versatility ( which i can vouch for having tested the stock @entity52 last year ) ; upgrades for police use one include steering , brakes and idle - time chip			1
almost all are 5.7 - liter @entity40 variants , which put out a whopping 368hp and top out at 170 mph			0
@entity62 autos : @entity63 ' @entity65 's ' @entity64 forget @entity69 's @entity68 - voiced @entity67 , we 're talking serious muscle with @entity64 's monstrous @entity71 that featured in last year 's ill - fated reworking of " @entity65 , " a model i also ragged around @entity76 port about this time last year ( and was very careful not to attract the attention of harbor authorities )			2
the most powerful stock car @entity64 has built , the @entity82 variant seethes and stomps its way to a mile a minute in about the same time as a corvette but shades it for fun thanks to its astonishing 480lb - ft of torque at 4500rpm and solid - axle rear suspension that allows the back end to fly out on fantastic cop - car action sequences			0
trivia : @entity92 , the 1980s original smartcar , stands for @entity92			0
@entity62 autos : @entity95 @entity98 police @entity96 want to make the 424 miles from @entity99 to @entity100 in under three hours ? @entity98 police long ago caught on to the race - driver fanaticism of its citizenry thanks in large part to @entity105 -- and perhaps less so to @entity106 -- and its polizia made sure they could keep up earlier this year by springing for a @entity109 , perhaps the most incredible police vehicle on the planet			1
alongside undeniable performance , this specially equipped supercar offers real - time wireless image - and - voice transmitting equipment and a natty cooler for storing crime scene evidence			2
initial reports suggest the @entity96 's reliability stands up to punishing police driving habits on @entity98 autostradas surprisingly well			1
@entity62 autos : @entity96 @entity127 ' @entity126 ' @entity125 long before the @entity128 was the main man to seek out at tailgate parties , @entity127 took the nickname and turned on a whole generation to the muscle of the @entity125 in his 1968 @entity133 that bounced and careened around the streets of @entity135 , @entity136 , in perhaps the era 's coolest film , and one which regularly tops the charts of best car chase captured on celluloid			1
the film pioneered cutaway shots of @entity127 , an avid rally driver , as he put the big - block pony through its paces in the 10 - minute scene but , unusually for the @entity149 , the main star here was his car			2
@entity64 released a limited - edition @entity126 commemorative model in 2008			0
@entity62 autos : @entity125 @entity153 1966 @entity154 with some suggesting a movie remake of the 1960s cult series is in the works , attention now focuses on what will take the place of the " @entity153 's " 1966 @entity154 , famously driven by @entity161 ( in his role of @entity163 )			1
while the angular and rectangular @entity165 pioneered gizmos like infrared lights , rocket launchers and flipper license plate more associated with @entity172 's @entity171 , it was always @entity161 and not @entity173 , the @entity174 , who got the pleasure of tilting the car onto two wheels to get through narrow alleyways and other criminal hang - outs			2
keep your eyes out for the latest movie developments , which may or may not -- but should -- include the famous line : " @entity184 , @entity163 ! " 1970s @entity185 judging by the huge rims and lowered suspensions on the @entity189 currently patrolling @entity191 beachfront , police departments often like to drop a hint of style and attitude in their rides , too			2
in the 1970s , decade of @entity198 sunglasses and massive sideburns , it was no different			0
officers to this day talk about the series of high - performance police vehicles that includes @entity204 , @entity12 and the legendary @entity205 , all stock @entity207 power with upgraded brakes and steering that packed more muscles than @entity212 in @entity213 most of these specially built units topped out near 150 mph and were especially prized for their straight - line capabilities while an officer in pursuit bumped and nudged his target vehicle in a bid to force them off the road			1
@entity62 autos : @entity224 " @entity225 " @entity226 the ultimate in machismo cool in its day , though now considered slightly cheeseball , @entity227 and @entity228 defined 1980s @entity230 slick with their boss combo of boats , ' bans and @entity235 swagger			1
though the @entity238 365 driven by the dynamic detectives in the first two series was a kit car replica of various @entity105 panels and equipment bolted onto a @entity245 chassis , the twin @entity236 that feature in the later series were donated by @entity105 , a fan of the show ( with an obvious gift for marketing )			1
the @entity226 would go on to define the @entity105 brand in @entity251 in the 1980s , while a strange breed of setose men in linen suits with no socks can still be spotted in corners of @entity257 to this day			0
in director @entity259 's 2006 movie , the @entity226 morphs into a suitably stylish @entity260			0
@entity261 as if @entity263 was n't enough 1980s for one list , we add @entity265 to the mix in his role as " @entity268 " without forgetting how much @entity265 's silky mustache and coiff did for sales of his trademark targa @entity273 in the @entity251			0
mid-engined and with the smaller wheelbase common to @entity105 's of the period , 308s sold in record numbers for @entity275 and can still be seen on roads today , indicating that @entity279 build quality can withstand some serious highway pounding that belies its lightweight fiberglass frame			0
@entity265 steered his on the mean streets of @entity284 , tracking criminals in his role as a private investigator			0
not a police vehicle , you say ? @entity265 's mustache qualifies him as an honorary police officer in my book any day			1
@entity294 's @entity7 " and one more thing ... " wraps up our list with @entity6 's @entity5 reveling in a dilapidated @entity7 banger to match his famously disheveled detective persona			0
@entity302 's finest prancing lion , a 1.5 liter four - cylinder that put out a mere 68hp , was a perfect fit with @entity6 's seemingly slow - witted persona that ultimately always got his man in the end			0
similarly , the 403 , which @entity5 delighted in driving the drop - top variant , was a vital cog in @entity7 's dominance of its domestic and @entity315 market with a series of idiosyncratic cars beloved by their followers but which remained a @entity321 mystery to their detractors			1
i had the pleasure of driving an excellent @entity7 cabriolet next to a vintage 403 at a motor show in @entity315 a couple years back , and felt a slight pang that i was n't wearing a shabby raincoat to match			0
@entity330 @entity329 everyone knows the @entity332 -- @entity333 and @entity330 's 1974 @entity334 in " @entity330 " movie -- but few know where all the cop cars famously smashed to pieces in the film came from			1
@entity340 , a journalist in @entity76 , says it was his dad , also @entity342 , a @entity344 , @entity343 , police radio engineer who was tasked with fixing up the @entity345 and @entity346 wrecked in the film ( with the @entity344 city council spurred into action by the possibility of @entity351 and @entity352 coming to their city to make a big - budget movie )			1
he once recounted to @entity359 : " i just remember one day my boss , the lieutenant who always gave me a hard time , came to me and pointed to the auto graveyard where all the out - of - service squad cars were and said , ' see all those cars ? your job is to get them started			0
' i said , ' are you kidding ? ' " @entity342 adds : " [ my @entity370 ] had a savant - like ability to rescue beaters from near - death experiences			0
when the movie came out , he went to see it like everyone else and he could remember each and every one of those cars			0
