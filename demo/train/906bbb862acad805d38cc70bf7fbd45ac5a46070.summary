-- after less than a week at sea , the @entity1 single - handed round the world yacht race has lived up to its moniker as " the world 's toughest race " -- with nearly a quarter of the field crashing out in the first few days			1
earlier this week , 20 sailors set off from @entity9 in @entity10 to begin the 38,700 kilometer circumnavigation -- in which they are expected to battle everything from fierce storms in the @entity14 to the dreaded doldrums of the equator , with just themselves and an 18 meter yacht for company			1
in the six editions of the race , first held in 1989 , only half of the competitors have ever completed it			2
so it is yet another testament , if one were needed , to the @entity1 's notorious difficulty that after five days , four competitors have already pulled out			1
@entity10 skipper @entity29 retired on the first day after his boat @entity31 broke her keel , just 95 kilometers off the coast of @entity10			2
@entity35 , 53 , had been one of the favorites to win this year 's @entity1 after finishing third in the last race , held in 2008 - 2009			1
day two was similarly dramatic with compatriot @entity38 , 51 , also pulling out after his yacht @entity40 was struck by a fishing boat off the coast of @entity43			0
" i went to sleep at the wrong time , " @entity44 told organizers			0
" i am not angry at the fisherman but at me because it should not have happened			0
you ca n't anticipate this , " he said			0
skippers are pushed to the limit , sleeping in snatches as they first sail the @entity55 , then the @entity14 , round @entity56 and head back through the @entity55 to @entity10 -- all in the hope of winning $ 190,600 in prize money			1
when sir @entity60 made history as the first person to sail non-stop around the world in 1969 , the epic voyage took him more than 10 months			0
fast forward 20 years and the @entity1 's competitors are expected to complete the course in just 90 days			1
@entity10 sailors have won all previous races , held every four years , with @entity68 taking the last one			1
but the third casualty was another @entity10 , @entity73 first timer @entity71 who , like his compatriot @entity44 , endured a dramatic collision with a shipping trawler on wednesday			0
finally , hoping to have made history as the only woman to ever win the race was briton @entity80 , the only female sailor in this year 's competition			0
but the mother - of - one , who finished fourth in 2009 - 2009 , announced thursday that the mast of her open 60 @entity85 yacht had come crashing down in rough seas north of @entity87 in the @entity55			1
both @entity80 and @entity71 are prevented by race rules from stopping at the nearest port to make repairs with a return to @entity92 d'olonnes the only option under the rules for a repair and continuation			0
in both cases , however , their boats are too badly damaged to make the six - day journey back to @entity10			2
for the remaining 16 contestants -- currently led by 35 year - old @entity103 -- it 's just the beginning of what is shaping up to be another drama - packed @entity1 .			2
