-- @entity1 has had an indisputably amazing year			0
though the quality of the actor 's movies remains up for debate ( we 're looking at you , @entity15			2
well , you too , @entity18			0
oh gosh , the @entity17 as well			0
and , as much as i hate to say it , perhaps even @entity20 ... do n't stone me ! ) , the fact that 60 - year - old @entity1 is at the peak of his career , recognized as an almost mythic @entity6 figure and opening a new action tentpole every couple of months , is nothing short of remarkable			1
and now @entity1 has another chart - topper to add to his already impressive resume : taken 2 , which debuted to an astounding $ 50 million from 3,661 theaters this weekend , good for a sizzling $ 13,657 per theater average			1
taken 2 's debut is the third - best ever in the month of october , behind 2011 ′ s @entity29 , which started with $ 52.6 million , and 2010 ′ s @entity30 , which started with $ 50.4 million			1
the revenge sequel also earned more than twice as much as the original @entity37 did in its opening weekend — that film surprised @entity34 when it bowed with $ 24.7 million in 2009 , and it also served as the catalyst for @entity1 's career jumpstart			1
thanks to great word - of - mouth , @entity37 chugged all the way to $ 145 million total			2
time will tell whether @entity43 can match its predecessor 's gross , but that may prove challenging			2
while the film did score a solid " b + " cinemascore grade , reviews were even harsher this time around and much has been made of the fact that @entity43 's storyline adheres so closely to the original			2
( of course , this did n't exactly crush @entity53 ) thanks to up - front excitement , taken 2 will almost certainly fall hard in the weeks to come , but considering @entity55 spent just $ 42 million to make the film , that wo n't matter			1
this is already a huge winner for everyone involved			0
@entity60 finished the weekend in second place , falling by an excellent 38 percent to $ 26.3 million			1
@entity63 's $ 85 million animated venture has earned $ 76 million in its first ten days — far ahead of @entity65 's most successful performer , @entity66 , which had earned $ 60.5 million at the same point in its run			2
with @entity72 still three weeks away — and competition like @entity75 apparently not a threat — the @entity71 - voiced kiddie flick will continue to hold well at the box office and glide right past the $ 100 million mark			1
in third was @entity80 's $ 17 million a cappella comedy @entity79 , which earned a solid $ 14.7 million out of 2,770 theaters			2
thanks to strong pre-release buzz — @entity79 garnered an " a " cinemascore grade and @entity80 opened the film a week early in 335 theaters last weekend -- the singing competition flick hit a box office high note with $ 5.1 million			0
though its per theater average understandably dropped from $ 15,371 to a still - strong $ 5,320 due to its expansion , @entity79 is already a big success story			0
when the original trailer hit the net earlier this year , @entity79 appeared to be an ill - conceived companion to marginally popular teen titles like @entity95 or you got served			0
but thanks to a dose of glee - ful vocals and strong reviews overall , the film no longer looks like a direct - to - @entity103 sibling of @entity104 : high - five , we 're alive ! ( we kid			0
) in fact , @entity79 may just be a new bring it on in its own right			0
the zeitgeisty film was cheap to make and is now well on its way to profitability			0
plus , it seems tailor - made for home market success with young women ( 74 percent of @entity79 's opening weekend audience was female ) and repeat - viewing			1
while @entity79 may never earn as much as taken 2 did in its first three days , it will end up being a well - liked success story for @entity80			1
@entity121 enjoyed a second weekend in fourth place , dropping by an encouraging 41 percent to $ 12.2 million			1
@entity124 's well - reviewed $ 35 million time - bending thriller , which stars @entity125 and @entity126 , has now earned $ 40.3 million after 10 days , and it could climb as high as $ 65 million total			1
a nice example of original content clicking with audiences			0
( see , @entity34 ? it is possible ! ) rounding out the @entity132 was @entity134 's @entity133 - directed @entity75 , the kooky , spooky tale which debuted with a rather disappointing $ 11.5 million			1
the $ 39 million film , about a boy trying to resurrect his deceased pooch , just did n't click with audiences			1
there are a few factors at play here			0
for starters , domestic moviegoers traditionally do n't like stop - motion animation all that much			1
the @entity146 ! band of @entity148 proved that earlier this year , when it sailed away with just $ 31.1 million			0
furthermore , it likely did n't help that @entity75 was in black and white — kids are used to bright , candy - colored options like @entity152 or @entity153			1
@entity75 did n't fit that mold			1
on top of that , there 's been a glut of creepy - ish kiddie titles in the marketplace lately			1
not only is the well - performing @entity60 cleaning up at the box office with its own brand of monstrous mayhem , @entity162 's @entity161 ( which has earned $ 54.4 million so far ) had a similar frankensteinian sensibility			1
how many animated movies about undead characters do families really want to see in the course of two months ? the sad part for @entity134 is that critics loved the film			0
@entity75 earned wonderful reviews overall and a " b + " cinemascore grade			2
perhaps it can find its legs in the weeks to come			0
taken 2 -- $ 50.0 million 2			0
@entity60 -- $ 26.3 million 3			2
pitch perfect -- $ 14.7 million 4			0
