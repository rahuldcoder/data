@entity0 , @entity1 -- president @entity3 on tuesday expressed hope that @entity6 's opposition movement , given new protection by a @entity9 - led military mission , can organize itself to revive broad enthusiasm for political change and oust @entity12 from power			1
in a 13 - minute interview with @entity2 's spanish - language network , @entity3 said the immediate goal of the @entity18 - sanctioned military mission that began saturday was to prevent an onslaught of the rebel stronghold of @entity21 by @entity12 's military			1
" because the international community rallied , his troops have now pulled back from @entity21 , " @entity3 said			2
now the @entity9 and its coalition partners , including @entity28 allies and @entity30 states , are establishing a no - fly zone over @entity6 , with @entity9 forces taking out @entity12 's air defense systems , @entity3 said			1
he conceded that @entity12 could " hunker down and wait it out even in the face of a no - fly zone , even though his forces have been degraded			1
" " our hope is that the first thing that happens once we clear this space is that the rebels start discussing how they 're able to organize themselves , how they articulate their aspirations for the @entity6 people , " @entity3 said			0
" potentially what we may see is all the enthusiasm that the @entity6 people had for a change in government that was occurring a few weeks ago , " but was brutally repressed by @entity12 , can now resurface , the president said			2
in particular , @entity3 said he hoped that the @entity6 people decide it was time for a change that ends up sweeping @entity12 from power			1
the president acknowledged the irony of being a @entity56 winner who ordered the @entity9 military into action on the eight anniversary of the 2003 @entity9 - led invasion of @entity61 , but said the goal in this case was humanitarian			1
" i 'm accustomed to this contradiction of being both a commander - in - chief but also somebody who aspires to peace , " @entity3 said , adding the @entity6 mission was to protect the @entity6 people from @entity12 's military			1
" we 're not invading a country ; we are not acting alone , " he said			0
" we are acting under a mandate issued by the @entity73			0
" the @entity75 people will see no contradiction between someone who believes in peace and " who wants to make sure people are n't butchered because of a dictator who wants to cling to power , " @entity3 added			0
speaking in @entity1 on the final leg of a three - nation @entity75 trip that included stops in @entity87 and @entity88 , @entity3 also cited what he called a new relationship between the @entity9 and the region to the south			2
he noted that an area once known for dictatorships and coups now featured democratic governments that were less focused on political ideology and more focused on results in helping their people			0
" that 's the kind of partner we want , " @entity3 said , describing the relationship as a " two - way street " based on mutual respect , interests and trust , rather than the old model of underdeveloped nations approaching the @entity9 with " hat in hand			1
" asked about immigration reform back home , @entity3 said he would again make the push for a comprehensive bill			0
" i 'm going to need some help , " he said			0
" i can get the majority of @entity117 to support it			0
i need some help from @entity119			0
" with last year 's census results showing a growing @entity122 population in the @entity9 , @entity3 said @entity119 will have a hard time winning future elections if they focus on anti-immigration sentiment .			2
