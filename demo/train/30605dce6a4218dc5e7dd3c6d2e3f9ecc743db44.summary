sen. @entity0 may be blaming the " liberal media " for the recent controversy over his comments about vaccinations , but the right - leaning editorial board of the @entity6 published a blistering opinion piece published in wednesday 's edition on the @entity11 @entity10 's skepticism			1
" he will have to avoid these libertarian dormitory passions if he wants to be a credible candidate , " the editorial says , adding that government requirements for vaccinating school children is " a legitimate use of state ' police powers ' under the @entity21			1
" @entity0 , who 's moving toward a presidential bid , caused a stir when he said monday that he 's " heard of many tragic cases of walking , talking , normal children who wound up with profound mental disorders after vaccines			1
" related : @entity29 : @entity0 's vaccine views are ' dangerous ' the vaccination debate became the center of a political firestorm this week with potential presidential candidates of both parties weighing in on the issue amid a recent measles outbreak that 's linked to @entity38 , despite the virus being eliminated in the @entity40 in 2000			1
@entity42 gov. @entity41 , also a potential presidential contender , kicked things off when he told reporters monday that " parents need to have some measure of choice " in determining whether to vaccinate their children , though he personally endorsed the idea			0
@entity0 said he 's also in favor of getting vaccinated , but his comments -- especially as a physician -- lent credibility to conspiracy theories that vaccinations can do severe damage			1
" mr. @entity0 is an ophthalmologist , so he should know he was broadcasting misinformation , " the @entity6 editorial states			2
his office did not return a request for comment about the editorial			0
related : @entity65 slams @entity0 for ' naive ' foreign policy , measles the piece acknowledges that in rare cases vaccines can lead to " deafness , seizures , comas or brain damage , " but the @entity75 says those results are " so rare that it is hard to tell whether they are caused by the vaccine			2
" the @entity6 also notes that president @entity80 and @entity81 also expressed skepticism over the safety of vaccines back in 2008			2
both , however , offered support for vaccines this past week			0
" let 's chalk up the weird science of @entity90			0
@entity0 and @entity41 to a lack of information , and we 're happy to send them 13 years of vaccine editorials if they want to study up , " the editorial later says			0
the not - so - great measles vaccine debate of 2015 is one of those events that makes us wonder if there is such a thing as human progress			0
" on tuesday @entity0 tried to clarify his comments , saying he was n't arguing causation but saying vaccinations and mental disorders " were temporally related " " i support vaccines , i receive them myself and i had all of my children vaccinated , " he added in a statement			1
" in fact today , i received the booster shot for the vaccines i got when i went to @entity116 last year			0

the @entity6 *likens* @entity0 's thoughts on vaccinations to " libertarian dormitory passions "
