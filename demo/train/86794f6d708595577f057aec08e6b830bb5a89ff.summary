-- it 's been 26 years since " @entity2 , " but the dogfights in that absurdly entertaining reagan - era classic have lost none of their speed - demon zap			1
that said , " @entity2 " lets you know that you 're basically watching a videogame with actors			2
not so with " @entity11 , " a lavishly square historical drama about the @entity13 , the very first @entity16 - @entity15 military pilots , who served in segregated units during @entity19 the movie has potent sequences of aerial combat that recall @entity23 and his flyboys bombarding evil out of the air			1

@entity76 , in the @entity23 - ian role of @entity74 -- the daredevil who must learn to fly in support of his team -- makes cocky bravado desperate and human			2
