-- it is the day after the tumultuous one before			0
victorious captain @entity2 has arrived back in @entity3 with the @entity5 trophy as the continent continues to celebrate one of the greatest sporting comebacks of all time			1
it is a very different story across the pond as the head scratching continues			0
how did the @entity13 turn what was supposed to be an emphatic victory into the ' @entity16 ' ? despite an insistence from both sides they would get together over a beer at the end of the competition come what may , no @entity13 players dropped into the @entity3 party , according to those who celebrated all night long			1
that should come as no surprise , as a party is probably the last thing any of the shell shocked @entity13 had on their minds as they tried to piece together a startling collapse that ended in a 14 1/2 - 13 1/2 defeat			1
not that they are alone in their disbelief			0
even some of the @entity3 players are still struggling to come to terms with such a decisive swing during the singles matches on sunday in @entity41			1
as they head back home after overturning a 10 - 6 deficit to claim a fifth @entity5 win in the last six years , the magnitude of their achievement is yet to sink in for some of those who made it happen			1
@entity41 resident @entity51 , who led the charge by taking down @entity53 champion @entity53 in the opening singles match , is one of them			0
" i still ca n't quite believe that happened yesterday , what an amazing feeling being a part of one of the biggest sporting comebacks ever , " he said on his official @entity57 site			1
@entity64 , who won four of his matches and gained a crucial point for @entity3 with a late victory over @entity69 champion @entity68 , echoed @entity51 's sentiments			1
" on the plane on the way back to @entity74 , why does it feel like we just robbed a bank ? not sure how long it 's going to take to sink in , " he said on the micro-blogging site			1
the joy the @entity3 contingent felt was tinged with relief for world no. 1 @entity82 , who nearly forfeited his match with @entity84 by missing his tee - off slot			1
the @entity86 thought he was teeing off at 11.25am eastern time , but @entity41 is in the @entity88 and his starting berth was an hour earlier			0
after a frantic call from his manager he was hurried to the course in a police car , arriving 11 minutes before his match was due to begin			0
had he missed the start , he 'd have handed a crucial point to @entity84 on a plate			0
" i was just lucky there was a @entity100 downstairs who could take me , get his lights on and pass all the traffic , ' he told reporters			0
" once we got off the highway it would have taken 10 minutes without him to get through that junction			0
" i 've never been so worried going to a golf course			0
i got to the course at 11.14 , so i had 11 minutes to get ready and had just enough time to put my shoes on , have a couple of putts and go to the first tee			0
" in a way it was n't a bad thing because i did n't have time to think about it -- and i played probably the best i played all week			0
" as for captain @entity2 , who channeled the spirit of the his great friend and erstwhile @entity5 playing partner , @entity123 , it was the crowning glory after a tough opening two days			1
the @entity13 dominated the foursomes and fourball matches , until a late @entity64 charge on saturday evening gave rise to the impossible dream , delivered in style by his charges on sunday			1
" it 's going to take a little while before it completely sinks in , " @entity2 was quoted as saying by the @entity134 website			2
" it 's been a very emotional week , especially when things were not going our way , but ( saturday ) everything turned round for us			2
" we changed a couple of crucial matches around down the stretch and that gave us the chance to have this trophy back			0
it 's completely different from playing , being a @entity5 captain			1
i think in my career it ranks number one			0
" the mood was very different back in the @entity13 , where one sports journalist was vilified for a column on saturday in which he said the @entity5 was done and dusted unless one of five things happened			1
one included the abduction of @entity84 , who lost to @entity82 , while another was a way for @entity2 to go back in time like @entity163 from the @entity165 movies			0
elsewhere in the press , recriminations started to fly			2
' @entity13 produce a choke for the ages at @entity5 , ' cried the @entity170			1
the @entity171 went with the headline ' @entity173 ' and said : " @entity3 forever will refer to it as the miracle at @entity176			2
for the @entity13 , @entity177 - ahhhhhhhhhh ! " several @entity3 players will now head to @entity179 , host of the @entity181 , to play in the next @entity134 event , including @entity183 , who holed the putt that ensured @entity3 would retain the trophy			1
@entity5 rookie @entity186 , who delivered a fourball point on friday with an inspired performance , said he was so enraptured by the atmosphere it will difficult going back to regular tour life			2
he said : " you do n't come across an atmosphere like this anywhere else			0
it 's almost like a fix -- you 're going to need to play in an atmosphere like this			2
" i can imagine how quiet it 's going to be for the guys playing in tournaments next week			2
it 's just going to be like you 're playing in your garden on your own			2

@entity3 's players bask in the glow of a *monumental* comeback @entity5 victory
several players involved in the *fightback* still struggling to take in their epic win
@entity13 press have started the *inquest* over what caused their team 's collapse
@entity3 hero @entity64 said on @entity57 it feels like " we have just robbed a bank "
