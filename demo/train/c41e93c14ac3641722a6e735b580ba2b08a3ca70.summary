@entity0 -- a @entity5 - based terrorist group that is actively attacking @entity3 troops across the border in @entity8 is an " arm " of the @entity5 intelligence agency , the top @entity3 military officer told @entity11 on thursday			1
the blunt accusation from the chairman of the @entity14 , adm. @entity13 , reflected the growing impatience of @entity3 officials with @entity5 's unwillingness to stop the attacks and the belief that @entity5 is actively supporting the insurgents			1
but the recent high profile attacks by insurgents in @entity8 represent a shift in strategy by the @entity26 , who have ceded control of territory in much of the country , the @entity3 secretary of defense said thursday			2
" the insurgency has been turned back in much of the country , including its heartland in the south , and @entity38 are increasingly strong and capable , " secretary of defense @entity31 said in a @entity33 hearing			1
the attacks , including last week 's attempt to strike at the @entity42 headquarters and the @entity43 in @entity44 and this week 's assassination of former @entity8 president @entity46 , who was leading efforts for reconciliation talks , have raised questions about the ability of @entity8 security forces to maintain control			1
but @entity31 , testifying to the committee along with @entity13 , said the @entity26 strikes are a sign of weakness			1
" we judge this change in tactics to be a result of a shift in momentum in our favor and a sign of weakness in the insurgency , " @entity31 said			2
he said many challenges remain			0
" we must be more effective in stopping these attacks and limiting the ability of insurgents to create perceptions of decreasing security , " he told the committee in his opening statement			0
the chairman of the committee , sen. @entity75 , @entity76 , said the ability of the @entity80 , a @entity5 militant group accused of being responsible for last week 's @entity44 attack and numerous others in which @entity3 and @entity42 troops have died , to launch attacks over the border from @entity5 is unacceptable			1
@entity75 expressed frustration with the @entity5 government , which has yet to use its troops to crack down on the insurgents and has not publicly condemned the attacks in @entity8 , either			1
@entity13 , appearing for the last time in front of the committee before his retirement at the end of the month , spoke candidly about concerns about the threat posed by the @entity80			1
@entity5 is " exporting " violence to @entity8 , he said			1
" the @entity80 , for one , acts as a veritable arm of @entity5 's intelligence , " @entity13 said			1
he said @entity5 's @entity101 supported the @entity80 insurgents who planned and executed the attack on the @entity43 and other strikes in @entity8			1
in doing so , @entity13 said , the agency is jeopardizing @entity5 's relations with the @entity3 and @entity8			1
but he added that the solution is not to give up on @entity5 and said a flawed relationship is better than no relationship			2
@entity13 has spent a significant amount of time during his chairmanship building relations with the @entity5			1
" some say i have wasted my time , " @entity13 said , but he disagrees , saying the situation would be far worse if not for @entity3 - @entity5 relations			1
in recent meetings between @entity3 and @entity5 officials , including @entity13 with the top @entity5 military officer and cia director @entity121 with @entity5 's top intelligence officer , the @entity3 has pushed @entity5 to crack down on the @entity80 , @entity31 said			1
given the public nature of thursday 's hearing , @entity31 would not discuss what further steps the @entity3 is willing to take to stop the attacks , but a @entity3 official said this week that the @entity128 has increased drone strikes against the insurgent network within @entity5			1
in @entity5 , a spokesman for the @entity132 denied that @entity101 supports the @entity80 insurgent group , brushing aside the @entity3 categorization of the connection as " perceptions			1
" in a press briefing held in @entity139 on thursday , spokesman @entity137 said @entity5 is not helping the @entity80			1
replying to a question on whether @entity5 is involved in a proxy war in @entity8 , @entity137 said , " i would say a categoric no. " foreign minister @entity142 said friday that the accusations coming out of @entity0 are unacceptable to @entity5			1
" you will lose an ally , " @entity142 said on @entity144			2
" you can not afford to alienate @entity5			2
you can not afford to alienate the @entity5 people			2
" members of @entity11 have raised the idea of cutting back on the billions of dollars in aid given to @entity5			2
sen. @entity153 , @entity154 , said the @entity155 has placed conditions on counterterrorism aid , including that the secretary of state must certify that @entity5 is cooperating in @entity3 efforts against the @entity80 and other terrorist groups			1
@entity31 differs with the @entity161 on whether that is a fair condition , but said he does support the message it will send			2
" anything that makes clear to them that we can not tolerate their providing this kind of safe haven to the @entity80 , and that they have to take action , any signal we can send to them i think would be important to do , " he said			2
the top @entity178 on the committee , sen. @entity175 , @entity176 , called for slowing down the withdrawal of troops from @entity8 to maintain the advantage of the surge of troops added last year			2
@entity13 said there is " increased risk " in pushing ahead with the withdrawal of 10,000 troops by next summer , as announced by president @entity189			2
" while the risk is up , i think it is manageable , " and military success can still be sustained , he said			0
@entity175 pressed @entity31 on whether the @entity46 assassination shows the @entity26 has no interest in reconciliation			0
" it does raise concerns			0
nevertheless , i think , obviously , we have to continue to try to pursue the opportunities that are out there			0
but we ought to do it with our eyes open , " @entity31 said			0
" the best signal we can send to the @entity26 is that we 're going to continue to fight them and that we 're going to continue to be there , and that we 're not going anywhere			0
and if we can send them that clear signal , i think that , more than anything , would influence their willingness to develop reconciliation			0
" the top commander in @entity8 , gen. @entity215 , believes @entity26 fighters in @entity8 are upset and frustrated , @entity13 said			1
with " their leadership parked in @entity5 , " @entity215 sees " the fighters on the field in @entity8 are more and more disgruntled			1
their morale is down , " @entity13 explained			0
regarding @entity222 , @entity31 said the @entity3 continues to negotiate over any presence of @entity3 troops in that country after 2011			0
currently , all @entity3 troops will be withdrawing from the country , in accordance with the existing agreement with @entity222			0
" no final decisions have been made , " @entity31 said			0
@entity222 has expressed a desire to maintain @entity3 trainers and other aid going forward , he noted , to help them deal with security threats			0
" i want to be clear that any future security relationship with @entity222 will be fundamentally different from the one that we have had since 2003			0
the @entity3 wants a normal , productive relationship and close strategic partnership with a sovereign @entity222 government going forward , " @entity31 said			0
" this kind of security assistance would be a means of furthering our strategic partnership with @entity222 that looks to the kind of future role that can best address @entity222 security needs			0
" @entity175 urged that the @entity3 not abandon @entity222 and " not withdraw from @entity222 as irresponsibly " as the @entity189 administration accused the the @entity252 government of being when the war was started			0
@entity31 and @entity13 also warned about cutting too much from the defense budget			1
if @entity11 can not come to an agreement on further spending cuts , an additional $ 500 million in defense spending would be cut			0
@entity13 said too harsh a cut would have a " good chance of breaking " the military			0
" we are not going to solve the debt problem on the back of the @entity264 , " he warned			0
@entity31 was equally emphatic in arguing against further cuts beyond the $ 350 billion the @entity264 has already committed to over the next 10 years			0
" if we pulled that trigger would we be shooting ourselves in the foot , " asked sen. @entity266 , @entity268 - @entity267			0
" we 'd be shooting ourselves in the head , " @entity31 said .			0
