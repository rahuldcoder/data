launched last march , @entity2 's startup produces and sells a wide variety of eye - catching fashion items , including bags , shoes and clothes			1
@entity2 says @entity6 is at the very heart of her brand , so every creation in her store is handmade with locally - sourced materials			2
" i love the @entity18 fabric , " she says			1
" [ growing up ] i liked looking unique , [ so ] i used to cut my clothes in different ways -- i used to change them , i used to sew with my hands			0
it all inspired me to come up with what i have today			0
