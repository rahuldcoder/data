-- a now - retracted @entity2 study that linked autism to childhood vaccines is an " elaborate fraud , " according to a medical journal -- a charge the physician behind the study vigorously denies			1
the @entity2 medical journal @entity11 , which published the results of its investigation , concluded dr. @entity14 misrepresented or altered the medical histories of all 12 of the patients whose cases formed the basis of the 1998 study -- and that there was " no doubt " @entity14 was responsible			1
the journalist who wrote the @entity11 articles said thursday he believes @entity14 should face criminal charges			1
however , @entity14 said his work has been " grossly distorted			1
" speaking on @entity0 's " @entity26 360 , " he said wednesday he is the target of " a ruthless , pragmatic attempt to crush any attempt to investigate valid vaccine safety concerns			0
" the medical publication says the study has done long - lasting damage to public health			2
read autism coverage on " @entity37 " blog			0
" it 's one thing to have a bad study , a study full of error , and for the authors then to admit that they made errors , " @entity38 , @entity11 's editor - in - chief , told @entity0			1
" but in this case , we have a very different picture of what seems to be a deliberate attempt to create an impression that there was a link by falsifying the data			2
" @entity2 stripped @entity14 of his medical license in may			1
what causes autism ? " meanwhile , the damage to public health continues , fueled by unbalanced media reporting and an ineffective response from government , researchers , journals and the medical profession , " bmj states in an editorial accompanying the work			2
@entity14 dismissed @entity67 , the writer of the @entity11 articles , as " a hit man who has been brought in to take me down " by pharmaceutical interests			1
deer has signed a disclosure form stating that he has no financial interest in the business			0
on @entity0 's " @entity75 " thursday , @entity67 did not deny he was paid by the @entity11			1
" i was commissioned by @entity11 to write the piece , " he said			1
" that 's what journalists do			0
" he said he is also paid by the @entity80 of @entity81 , where he has been employed since the early 1980s			0
" i was being paid as a journalist , " he told @entity0 's @entity82			2
you 're being paid to do your job			0
" " the point you have to remember about all this , firstly , it 's not me saying this			0
it 's the editors of the @entity11 , " @entity67 said			1
" ... secondly , this material has been published in the @entity2 in extraordinary detail			1
if it is true that @entity14 is not guilty as charged , he has the remedy of bringing a libel action against myself , the @entity80 of @entity81 , against the medical journal here , and he would be the richest man in @entity101			1
" he said @entity14 's remarks amount to a smear campaign against him , noting that @entity14 has previously sued him and lost			1
the autism assignment was a " routine assignment " given to him in 2003 , he said , adding that he expected it to be finished in a week or two			0
however , " when you 're a journalist and you see that somebody you 're dealing with is lying to you , " it must be pursued , he said			2
@entity14 , he said , is attempting to " cloud the picture ... some people say he 's a liar and he says i 'm a liar			1
what he 's basically trying to do is split the difference			0
" allegations that he is in collusion with the pharmaceutical industry are " another one of @entity14 's concoctions , " @entity67 said			1
" he knows it 's not true			0
" asked whether he thinks @entity14 should face criminal charges , @entity67 said , " i personally do			1
" in addition , he said the @entity125 should take a close look at @entity14 's visa application and how he got into the @entity101 , " how he 's been able to export his mischief			2
" @entity129 , president of the @entity130 , defended @entity14 in a @entity0 interview			2
" i can not imagine for a second that dr. @entity14 would have any reason to falsify data , " she said			1
" he 's a man of integrity and honesty and truly wants to find the answers for millions of children who have been affected by autism			0
" @entity129 accused pharmaceutical companies of trying to protect their turf			0
" you ca n't question vaccines without being destroyed , " she said			0
" there 's too much money at stake here			0
" @entity149 , the father of an 8 - year - old with autism and a co-founder of @entity149 -- a group that believes there 's a connection between autism and vaccinations -- also questioned the motivation behind the investigation into @entity14 's work			1
" children are given 36 vaccines in the @entity101 by the time they reach the age of five , " he said			0
" this is an attempt to whitewash , once and for all , the notion that vaccines cause autism			0
" the now - discredited paper panicked many parents and led to a sharp drop in the number of children getting the vaccine that prevents measles , mumps and rubella			2
vaccination rates dropped sharply in @entity2 after its publication , falling as low as 80 % by 2004			2
measles cases have gone up sharply in the ensuing years			0
in the @entity101 , more cases of measles were reported in 2008 than in any other year since 1997 , according to the @entity182			0
more than 90 % of those infected had not been vaccinated or their vaccination status was unknown , the @entity182 reported			0
" but perhaps as important as the scare 's effect on infectious disease is the energy , emotion and money that have been diverted away from efforts to understand the real causes of autism and how to help children and families who live with it , " the @entity11 editorial states			2
@entity14 has been unable to reproduce his results in the face of criticism , and other researchers have been unable to match them			1
most of his co-authors withdrew their names from the study in 2004 after learning he had had been paid by a law firm that intended to sue vaccine manufacturers -- a serious conflict of interest he failed to disclose			2
after years of controversy , the @entity210 , the prestigious journal that originally published the research , retracted @entity14 's paper last february			1
actress @entity215 , founder of @entity149 and whose son also has autism , declined to comment on wednesday 's developments , but has previously supported @entity14			2
" it is our most sincere belief that dr. @entity14 and parents of children with autism around the world are being subjected to a remarkable media campaign engineered by vaccine manufacturers reporting on the retraction , " she said after the @entity210 retraction			2
@entity67 said @entity14 " chiseled " the data before him , " falsifying medical histories of children and essentially concocting a picture , which was the picture he was contracted to find by lawyers hoping to sue vaccine manufacturers and to create a vaccine scare			1
" according to @entity11 , @entity14 received more than 435,000 pounds ( $ 674,000 ) from the lawyers			1
@entity38 , the journal 's editor - in - chief , said the study shows that of the 12 cases @entity14 examined in his paper , five showed developmental problems before receiving the @entity246 vaccine and three never had autism			1
" it 's always hard to explain fraud and where it affects people to lie in science , " @entity38 said			0
" but it does seem a financial motive was underlying this , both in terms of payments by lawyers and through legal aid grants that he received but also through financial schemes that he hoped would benefit him through diagnostic and other tests for autism and @entity246 - related issues			0
" but @entity14 told @entity0 that claims of a link between the @entity246 vaccine and autism " came from the parents , not me , " and that his paper had " nothing to do with the litigation			1
" " these children were seen on the basis of their clinical symptoms , for their clinical need , and they were seen by expert clinicians and their disease diagnosed by them , not by me , " he said			0
dr. @entity278 , a pediatric neurologist at @entity279 in @entity280 , said the reporting " represents @entity14 as a person where the ends justified the means			2
" but he said the latest news may have little effect on those families who still blame vaccines for their children 's conditions			0
" unfortunately , his core group of supporters is not going to let the facts dissuade their beliefs that @entity246 causes autism , " @entity278 said			0
" they need to be open - minded and examine the information as everybody else			0
" @entity14 's defenders include @entity301 , a journalist who has written extensively on autism			1
he told @entity0 that @entity14 not only has denied falsifying data , he has said he had no way to do so			1
" i have known him for a number of years			0
he does not strike me as a charlatan or a liar , " @entity301 said			0
if the @entity11 allegations are true , then @entity14 " did a terrible thing " -- but he added , " i personally find it hard to believe that he did that			1
" @entity0 's @entity314 , @entity315 and @entity316 contributed to this report .			0
