he said he planned for months how he would snatch her so she could join him and his wife in a " celestial " plural marriage , @entity7 testified			1
" he said they had been preparing for me since he saw me , " she said			1
it was the fall of 2001 , and he was panhandling outside a mall in downtown @entity0 , @entity1			1
@entity7 said she was with her mother and five brothers and sisters , shopping for school clothes			1
" my mother gave gave him five bucks , " @entity7 told told the jury			1
@entity6 was hired by her mother to fix a leaky skylight and rake leaves			1
@entity7 saw him around the house that fall but never spoke to him , she said			1
before dawn on june 2 , 2002 , she awoke to the sound of a man 's voice and a cold sharp blade against her throat			1
" i remember him saying , ' i have a knife to your neck			1
do n't make a sound			1
get out of bed and come with me or i will kill you and your family , ' " @entity7 testified			1
he led her in her red silk pajamas up a trail into the rugged back country and over a ridge , hiking what she estimated to be three to five hours to a crude campsite			2
there , she said , he " sealed " her to him as his wife and raped her			2
she said she begged him to stop , pleading , " i 'm just a little girl			2
" she struggled , but she said at age 14 she was no match for a grown man			1
afterward , she cried herself to sleep			2
the next day , as she cried again , he told her she was " lucky , " @entity7 testified			1
he said he was a prophet and that @entity59 had chosen her to be by his side as he prepared for the second coming of @entity63			2

" i felt like i had a burden the size of a mountain to carry around with me the rest of my life , " @entity7 said			1

" you 'll have to ferret out not only what happened , but why it happened , " attorney @entity105 told jurors earlier monday			2
" we 're asking you to determine what was in someone 's mind			2
this is made difficult with a crazy mind			2
the easy explanation is not always the correct one			2
" he described his client as " a crazy person who comes in the middle of the night " -- exactly what we are taught to fear as children , he said			1

i never wanted to see him again , " she said			0

i was n't the same			0

" i had n't changed			0
i was still a person of worth ... i decided to live			0

" and i remember saying that if he let me go right now , we would n't press charges on him			0
and he said he knew exactly what he was doing and he understood the consequences of his actions			0
