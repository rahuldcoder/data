billed by @entity2 as having been " designed for humans , " the phone features voice and eye - recognition technology that the company hopes will set the handset ahead of its rivals in the crowded smartphone market			1
@entity2 has overtaken @entity23 as the world 's best - selling mobile phone maker , and @entity26 reported tuesday that @entity2 also overtook @entity7 in smartphone sales in the first quarter , in what it described as " increasingly a two - horse race			1
" opinion : @entity4 wo n't be for everyone the new @entity34 handset , which runs the most up - to - date version of @entity37 's mobile operating system -- android 4.0 @entity38 -- recognizes when a user is looking at it , and ensures the screen does n't go dark while it has eye contact			1
@entity44 technology -- @entity2 's equivalent of @entity7 's @entity46 -- enables users to wake up their phone with a simple voice command			2
and voice recognition goes further -- saying : " @entity34 ... picture , " for example , opens the phone 's camera app , and saying " cheese " takes a picture			2
face - recognition software then identifies @entity59 friends within images , and prompts the user to share them			0

" when you compare it to the nearest rival it feels like they have pulled off a bit of a trick , " he said			0
" they have put some effort into software innovations , particularly the eye recognition			0
the voice recognition feels like a reaction to @entity46 on the @entity8 , but i do n't know many people who actually talk to their phones			0
