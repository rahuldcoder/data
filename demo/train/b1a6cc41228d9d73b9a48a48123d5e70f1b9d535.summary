@entity0 , @entity1 -- an empty chair stood in for imprisoned @entity5 dissident @entity4 as he was awarded the @entity6 in absentia on friday amid protests and condemnation from @entity5			1
@entity5 has responded furiously since the @entity11 committee announced on october 8 that @entity4 would be its peace prize winner			1
officials have repeatedly called @entity4 a common criminal and declared the award a @entity17 plot against @entity5			1
the rhetoric continued friday with @entity5 calling the awarding of the prize to @entity4 a " political farce			1
" " the decision of the @entity25 does not represent the wish of the majority of the people in the world , particularly that of the developing countries , " said @entity22 , a @entity23 official			2
@entity4 , a professor of literature , is serving an 11 - year sentence in a @entity5 prison for what the government called " inciting subversion of state power			1
" he was not allowed to travel to @entity1 to accept the prize , nor was his wife , @entity40			0
@entity43 chairman @entity42 , in awarding the prize friday , likened @entity4 to @entity44 , the former @entity45 president who fought the apartheid regime			1
after announcing the award , @entity42 placed @entity4 's medal in the empty chair , the second time such a symbol has been used in the event			1
before the ceremony , some @entity54 users who listed their location as @entity56 had changed their profile pictures to an empty chair			1
in his speech , @entity42 commended @entity5 for lifting millions out of poverty , but said democracy and free speech must go hand in hand with its economic development			2
" @entity5 , too , will grow stronger if its people are granted civil rights , " @entity42 said			1
while @entity5 officials have said the prize represents a @entity17 perspective , human rights activists in @entity5 " represent the world 's common values and standards , " @entity42 said			1
he added that @entity4 has done nothing wrong and " must be released			1
" @entity77 president @entity76 also called for @entity4 's immediate release			1
" mr. @entity4 reminds us that human dignity also depends upon the advance of democracy , open society , and the rule of law , " @entity76 said in a statement			1
" the values he espouses are universal , his struggle is peaceful , and he should be released as soon as possible			2
" as the awards ceremony was getting under way , a large number of officers stood guard outside the west central @entity56 apartment complex where @entity4 's wife has been under house arrest since her husband 's award was announced			2
journalists were cordoned off in a small area next to the building			0
the police presence outside the @entity103 in @entity56 had also increased early friday as groups of protesters gathered there and at the city 's @entity107 offices			0
@entity42 said thursday that the award is not a protest			0
" it is a signal to @entity5 that it would be very important for @entity5 's future to combine economic development with political reforms and it is support for those people in @entity5 who are struggling for basic human rights , " @entity42 told reporters			1
@entity56 also put pressure on its allies and other countries not to attend the peace prize ceremony , and it hastily announced its own honor -- the @entity123 , which was awarded thursday to former @entity125 vice president @entity124			0
that award was accepted by a 6 - year - old girl on @entity124 's behalf			0
@entity124 did not know about the prize , his office said			0
@entity131 said it had received reports from " reliable sources " that @entity5 diplomats in @entity1 have been pressuring @entity5 residents into joining @entity137 demonstrations			0
on thursday , the @entity107 's human rights chief called for @entity4 's release from prison and criticized what she said were " recent restrictions placed on an ever - widening circle " of the dissident 's associates			1
" in recent weeks , my office has received reports of at least 20 activists being arrested or detained and more than 120 other cases of house arrest , travel restrictions , forced relocations and other acts of intimidation , " @entity147 @entity146 told reporters			0
@entity42 said the committee expected a " harsh reaction " from @entity56			0
but " we are very glad to see that two - thirds of the nations that have embassies in @entity0 will be attending the ceremony , and most of them are very big , very important countries , " he added			0
among those attending was @entity77 house speaker @entity169 , who was part of the official delegation on behalf of @entity4 and his wife			0
of the 19 countries that declined to come to friday 's ceremony -- including @entity5 , @entity175 , @entity176 , @entity177 , @entity178 and @entity179 -- @entity42 said thursday that two had reconsidered : @entity180 and the @entity181			2
but the state - run @entity183 newspaper reported friday that " most nations " had expressed their support for @entity5 's stance , citing a @entity23 spokeswoman			1
the spokeswoman , @entity22 , said the award would not change the fact that " @entity4 committed crimes			0
" friday 's ceremony included songs by a children 's choir -- a special request made by @entity4 through his wife , according to @entity199			2
and @entity103 actress @entity200 was on hand to read one of @entity4 's " most interesting and beautiful texts , " @entity42 said			2
@entity42 predicted that keeping @entity4 , 54 , in prison for the entirety of his 11 - year sentence may prove impossible after the prize was awarded			0
" the pressure from the outside world will be on @entity5 to release him			2
in today 's world , it is totally impossible to close a country			2
we already know that a lot of @entity5 know about the prize , and this is creating a huge pressure on @entity5 , " @entity42 said			0
several foreign news websites -- including @entity2 and @entity219 -- were blocked in mainland @entity5 thursday and friday			0
broadcasts of @entity221 were blacked out intermittently , when news of the peace prize was reported			0
@entity2 reports about @entity5 's new @entity123 were not blocked			2
internet companies in @entity5 are treating @entity5 characters for " @entity4 , " " @entity11 , " and peace prize as " sensitive words , " said @entity228 , editor of @entity228 -- a website about @entity5 media and @entity231			1
acting on government instructions , the companies are deleting text containing those words , preventing such text from being uploaded , or returning no results on searches for the words , he said			0
" i think the main aim is to reduce the chances of @entity5 citizens seeing that the @entity241 is big news internationally , and to make it more difficult for articles sympathetic to @entity4 and photos of him to be copied and circulated inside @entity5 , " @entity228 said			1
the last time an empty chair was used to represent an absent winner was when @entity249 peace activist @entity248 won the 1935 award , according to @entity199 , director of the @entity251			1
@entity248 was under " protective custody " in @entity253 and could not come to accept the award in person , nor was he represented by anyone			0
three other @entity11 peace laureates were also unable to attend their ceremonies for political reasons -- human rights activist @entity260 , @entity262 trade union leader @entity261 , and @entity175 @entity264 dissident @entity263 -- but spouses or other relatives accepted the awards on their behalf			1
@entity2 's @entity269 , @entity270 , @entity271 and @entity272 contributed to this report .			0
