-- @entity1 has been forced to withdraw from the @entity2 for the second successive year after suffering an injured heel			1
@entity1 , who surrendered the @entity5 spot monday to @entity6 , was hoping to build on her title win at the @entity8 where she defeated the @entity10 star			1
the @entity11 would have regained the @entity5 ranking had she won the tournament , but @entity6 is set to remain at the summit until the @entity17 @entity16 tournament next month			1
" i 'm very disappointed , but i have to listen to my body , " @entity1 told reporters			1
" the injury happened last week when i played a lot of tennis , so going on to a new tournament is just too much			1
the heel kept getting worse , and i needed to re-evaluate			1
" sometimes the schedule is just too difficult			2
unfortunately you ca n't know when you plan it in november what will happen in february			2
" i did n't want to continue taking painkillers because sometimes it 's better to feel the pain			2
so that you can control the injury			1
otherwise it can cause something which is much worse			2
" this is just a warning that i have to take care of myself			0
" @entity1 , who has a 14 - 0 record this year , revealed that the physical demands of the schedule has become a growing concern since she won the @entity41 last month			1
" i never realised before just how much it takes out of you , " she said			0
" physically and mentally it just drains you out - and then you realise			0
" meanwhile , @entity6 , who is the oldest woman to ever hold top spot in the rankings , is the big favorite for the $ 2 million tournament			1
and the 31 - year - old says she 's feeling in rude health going into the competition			0
she told reporters : " i was really , really , really , really sick last week and physically i just was n't at my best , considering i could n't train , and i did n't practice			0
" i practised only one or two days before playing because i had the ankle problems			0
" but i did n't want to not show up and not play			0
so at least if i could show up and play my way into shape i would be able to compete and that 's what i did			0
" i feel so much better this week already			0
i feel like a completely different athlete , and a completely different person , compared with last week			0
