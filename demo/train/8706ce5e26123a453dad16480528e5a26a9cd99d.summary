robot dinosaurs , @entity3 men and @entity4 -- all could become @entity6 's newest residents as the city is set to house a slew of new theme parks			1
on the roster is everything from big brands like @entity13 and @entity14 , to new concepts set to make a splash			1
literally in the case of @entity18 , slated to be the world 's largest underwater park when it 's completed ( the tentative date is 2020 , to correspond with the @entity22 )			1
size is a theme for many of the parks on the list			2
one proposed project , @entity29 , hopes to usurp @entity30 as the world 's largest indoor theme park			1
it will include four zones , including @entity35 -- a @entity37 - themed segment -- as well as two zones dedicated to characters from @entity40 and @entity41 , respectively			2
" we want this park to be one of the center points in the future of @entity6 , " explains @entity42 , the vice president of marketing for @entity43 , the developer behind the project			1
" as such , you do n't want to build something that wo n't get global attention , and if that means it 's big , that 's what you do			2
there 's no point in building it small			2
" what 's in a name ? many of @entity6 's developers plan to rely heavily on pop culture and name recognition in bringing people to their parks			1
this is especially true of the planned @entity70 , planned in an expanse 60 kilometers ( 37 miles ) from @entity72			0
a theme - park conglomerate , @entity70 will house a @entity13 , as well as a @entity75 - themed park and the @entity76 - themed @entity6			1
" movies have become the kind of entertainment that binds people , young or old , across the globe , because they all watch the same movies , " notes @entity77 , a theme park consultant and the managing director at @entity80			1
" it used to be that if you were to develop a theme park , you 'd take an indigenous theme unique to the area and build on that			1
now , it 's almost the opposite			0
you take an international concept known around the world , like @entity41			0
" thinking different aside from the financial incentives , developers cite @entity6 's willingness to think outside the box as part of the appeal of setting up in the city			1
" @entity6 has an overabundance of vision , " says @entity104 , the ceo of @entity105 , an underwater design company			1
@entity18 will be a five - acre underwater park with a @entity110 theme			1
in addition to luring scuba divers and snorkelers , the underwater attraction will also act as a huge artificial reef , designed to attract and nurture aquatic life			2
" we 're building for two clients : one has credit cards , the other has fins , " jokes @entity104			0
when first pitching the sustainable tourism venture , he approached properties in the @entity124 , all to no avail			0
" i told them , we 'd build these sites , they would n't have to put up any money up front , and if they happened to make money from them -- which we knew they would -- we could talk about a revenue share			0
we did n't get any traction , " says @entity104			0
@entity6 , however , was a different story			2
they can conceive of it and they can produce it , " he says			0
the @entity146 of the @entity147 ? while @entity6 is currently home to a handful of theme parks -- most notably @entity151 and @entity153 's @entity152 -- the city has yet to establish much of a track record in the industry			1
many projects announced prior to the 2008 crash were assigned to the scrap heap afterwards			0
" in our industry , there tends to be more announcements of theme parks than those actually built , " warns @entity77			2
" it 's a quandary for analysts like myself			0
typically we look at new projects as a share of the existing market , so it 's very hard to evaluate the potential for going into somewhere entirely new			0
" then again , building an entertainment industry from scratch is n't unprecedented			0
@entity77 points out that @entity146 , @entity175 was virtually unknown until the 1970s when @entity176 moved in			0
" @entity6 wants to become an international tourist destination for leisure , one that serves not just the greater region , but the entire world			1
whether they 'll be successful , that 's a big question , but that 's their goal , " says @entity77			0
