-- a federal judge threw out @entity3 's lawsuit against the @entity4 with great force and speed monday , blasting the seven - time @entity8 champion in a sharply worded ruling			1
@entity3 filed the case monday morning in his hometown of @entity12 , @entity13 , in a bid to halt a doping case against him			1
in his brief order , @entity17 district judge @entity16 wrote that the case was full of legally irrelevant claims " included solely to increase media coverage of this case " and stir up hostility toward the @entity4			1
" this court is not inclined to indulge @entity3 's desire for publicity , self - aggrandizement , or vilification of defendants , by sifting through 80 mostly unnecessary pages in search of the few kernels of factual material relevant to his claims , " @entity24 wrote			1
he urged the cyclist to re-file his lawsuit without " any improper argument , rhetoric , or irrelevant material			0
" " contrary to @entity3 's apparent belief , pleadings filed in the @entity46 are not press releases , internet blogs or pieces of investigative journalism , " the judge added in a footnote			1
" all parties , and their lawyers , are expected to comply with the rules of this court , and face potential sanctions if they do not			0
" @entity57 @entity8 cyclist arrested in a statement issued late monday , @entity3 lawyer @entity58 said he would " conform my conduct precisely " to the judge 's order			1

" it does n't change the legal issues involved or any of the relief that we seek			0
" @entity67 , another @entity3 attorney , said the suit could be re-filed as early as tuesday			2
the @entity4 has accused @entity3 of using performance - enhancing drugs			1
the 40 - year - old cyclist , who is now competing in triathlons , had asked the court to file an injunction against the @entity4 by saturday , the agency 's deadline for @entity3 to either contest the charges or accept sanctions			1
@entity3 maintains he has never tested positive for performance - enhancing drugs and said the @entity4 and its ceo , @entity79 , are out to get a " big fish " to justify the agency 's existence			1
" defendants have charged mr. @entity3 with unspecified doping violations and seek to try him through @entity4 's self - created , self - regulated and self - operated process that it has rigged to ensure that it can not lose , " the lawsuit says			1
" @entity4 's kangaroo court proceeding would violate due process even if @entity4 had jurisdiction to pursue its charges against mr. @entity3			1
" in june , the agency announced that it was opening proceedings against @entity3 and five former teammates			2
in a statement issued in response to the lawsuit , @entity79 said the agency " was built by athletes on the principles of fairness and integrity			0
" " like previous lawsuits aimed at concealing the truth , this lawsuit is without merit and we are confident the courts will continue to uphold the established rules , which provide full constitutional due process and are designed to protect the rights of clean athletes and the integrity of sport , " he said			0
the 40 - year - old @entity3 has said the @entity114 , the international governing body of cycling , is the " only organization permitted to assess the evidence			1
" he said he has taken at least 500 drug tests in his cycling career without failing one			0

the @entity4 is a quasi-government agency recognized as the official anti-doping agency for @entity130 , @entity131 and @entity133 events in the @entity17			2
in a june letter to @entity3 , a copy of which was obtained by @entity0 , the agency said it collected blood samples from @entity3 in 2009 and 2010 that were " fully consistent with blood manipulation including @entity140 use and / or blood transfusions			2
" @entity140 , or erythropoietin , boosts the number of red blood cells , which carry oxygen to the muscles			0
the letter accused @entity3 and five former cycling team associates engaged in a doping conspiracy from 1998 to 2011			1

@entity3 has been dogged by allegations of drug abuse in recent years , with compatriot @entity159 -- who was found guilty of doping in the @entity160 , resulting in him being stripped of the title -- making a series of claims last year			1
