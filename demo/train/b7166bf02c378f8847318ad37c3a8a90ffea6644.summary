-- what makes airline passengers happy ? sometimes it 's as simple as a smile			1
along with mobile check - in , @entity6 in the air and other technological advances , the simple act of airline employees smiling is increasing airline passenger satisfaction			1

@entity16 airlines collect $ 6 billion in fees " traditional carriers have improved significantly across the entire passenger experience , and it is a positive sign to see them turn a corner and starting to rise again , even as there is still more opportunity to improve , " said @entity18 , senior manager of @entity20 's global travel and hospitality practice			0
" while satisfaction with low - cost carriers only slightly improves , greater gains in the rest of the experience are masked by lower passenger satisfaction with cost and fees			1

" overall satisfaction with the airlines improved to 695 on the 1,000 point scale , a 14 - point increase over the 2012 survey			2
the power of a smile despite passengers choosing to check in online rather than talk to someone at an airport ticket counter , how an airline 's employees treat customers still counts			1

" airlines do n't have to invest millions of dollars in the aircraft to get employees to smile , " said @entity18			0
a few trainings , including information about the impact on customer satisfaction , may help the cabin and cockpit crew make better eye contact and smile more , she said			2
of course it helps to have happy employees			0
" one of things we see is that when you see companies that have high internal employee satisfaction , they have high customer satisfaction as well , " she said			2
customers love technology now a smile does n't take care of everything			0
customers also want their technology			0
those who use @entity6 in - flight are happier ( 39 points happier ) than those who do not use it			1
more than one - third of customers surveyed check in online , and 15 % of those technologically savvy fliers use their smartphones or other mobile devices ( compared to 6 % two years ago )			2
passengers checking in via mobile applications are the happiest of all fliers checking into their flights , followed by passengers who check in using a mobile device , passengers who check in at an airport kiosk and those who use the main ticket counter			2
baggage fees still lower satisfaction even attitudes toward baggage fees are beginning to soften			2
although passengers are still dissatisfied with being charged for something that used to be included in the price of a plane ticket , they are n't as grumpy about it			0
the gap between passengers who pay for baggage and those who do not pay shrank to 63 points this year , compared with an 85 point gap last year and a 100 point gap in 2011			2
some 37 % of passengers who pay for bags agree that the fees are reasonable , compared to 28 % last year and 18 % in 2011			1
" baggage fees are still a point of contention for people , and it 's still a ' disatisfier , ' but people are starting to accept it 's a cost to travel , " said @entity18			0
to help reduce costs , @entity20 recommends using an airline 's mobile application to check in , select seats and receive an electronic boarding pass			0
if you do n't have an airline credit card or frequent flier status to waive baggage fees , look for discounts when checking in online			0
