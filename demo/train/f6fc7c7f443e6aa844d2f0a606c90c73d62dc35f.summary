it 's either a genius idea for reducing the miseries of long - haul air travel -- or an extreme method of distracting passengers from arguments about leg room			2
either way , an @entity8 proposal for in - flight virtual reality sensory isolation headgear that controls sights , sounds and even smells experienced by travelers is likely to turn heads -- although if the heads are stuck in helmets , there might not be much room for turning			1
the @entity19 aircraft manufacturer has filed a patent for the headgear which @entity23 inventor @entity22 says could help alleviate boredom , reduce stress and prevent injury via a mini-airbag system designed to deploy in the event of turbulence			1
" during aircraft flights , certain passengers have periods when they are bored either during a wait phase preceding take off or following landing or during a cruise phase , " the patent application says			2
" more - over it is known that aircraft flights generate stress for certain passengers			0
" ' @entity40 substances ' the patent suggests that placing passengers in partial or total " sensorial isolation " by piping audio and video directly into their eyes and ears -- and squirting " odorous substances " up their nose -- will help make all this go away			2
" this isolation allows the passenger to better profit from some of the distractions offered , for example listening to music , watching films , " says the screed attached to the invention blueprints			0
" if the passengers is sensitive to stress , this isolation , possibly associated with one of the above - mentioned activities allows him / her to more easily calm down and relax			0
" the helmets , designed to be incorporated into the headrest , will also feature remote controls and technology that projects a virtual reality keyboard on the fold down table , enabling passengers to hammer out emails directly on to the detritus of their in - flight meal			1
it 's not known if there are any plans to introduce the helmets in the near future -- @entity8 has n't responded to a @entity86 query -- but it 's likely they 're at the same distant stage as another unusual @entity8 patent that proposes cycle saddle - style seating			1
it remains to be seen whether sensory isolation can genuinely improve the in - flight experience , but the innovation must surely be a gift to airline staff			0
while the eyes of their passengers are helmeted in virtual reality , cabin crew can return to actual reality and relax the mandatory smiles .			0

helmets will control what passengers see , hear and smell , according to @entity8 patent
incorporated into headrests , the system will also feature mini-airbags to deploy in turbulence
no *indication* when or even if @entity8 will go *ahead* with proposed design
