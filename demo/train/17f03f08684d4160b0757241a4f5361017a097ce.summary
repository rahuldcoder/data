-- the battle over same - sex civil unions in @entity5 did not end when a legislative committee killed a measure to allow them monday , leaders for both sides said tuesday			1
" we will keep fighting to equality and # civilunions , " state rep. @entity8 , the leader of the minority @entity9 , said in a @entity11 posting after a committee voted 5 - 4 not to sent the bill to the house floor			1
@entity5 house speaker @entity18 , who assigned the bill to a committee where he knew the majority @entity20 would opposed it , acknowledged tuesday that the civil unions debate " is not over for the year			1
" " it 's pretty clear ( the @entity9 ) are attempting to use this as an agenda item heading into the november elections , " @entity18 told @entity0 in a phone interview			0
" @entity18 fights against equality & thwarts democratic process voters will remember , " @entity8 , the bill 's sponsor , tweeted tuesday			2
@entity18 accused gov. @entity32 , a @entity33 , of trying to divide @entity34 by calling the special session to consider the civil unions bill			1
the speaker sent the bill to the @entity39 , which @entity8 called @entity18 's " kill committee , " so the process would " move as efficiently as possible " to allow legislators to " refocus our efforts to put @entity34 back to work			2
" " @entity5 has an unemployment rate that is still far too high , " @entity18 said			0
@entity18 disputes @entity32 's claim that the civil unions bill is not a same - sex marriage measure , which the @entity5 state constitution prohibits			1
" the bill itself makes the case for that , " he said			0
" it really is creating the concept of same - sex marriage			2
" it would lead to a costly legal fight over its constitutionality , he said			0
" there 's no doubt in my mind this would happen			0
" the civil unions bill cleared committees in the last days of the regular session , but was filibustered by republicans in the final days , @entity32 said			1
he called this week 's special session to complete the work			0
" they would n't let it come to the floor , and when it died , 30 other bills died			0
and these are important to our businesses , " the governor told @entity0			0
@entity18 said it was " a last - minute , divisive attack on our traditional views on marriage for short - term political gain			2
" @entity18 suggested there was a link between what is going on in @entity5 and president @entity88 's announcement last week that he supports same - sex marriage			1
" to me , it 's more than a simple coincidence that all of this is happening at the same time , " @entity18 said			0
" bills die on the calendar every year and we do n't have a special session as a result of it			0
" a civil union is a legal status created by the state of @entity103 in 2000 , and subsequently adopted by a number of other states , according to @entity106 , in a posting on its website			2
" it provides legal protection to couples at the state law level , but omits federal protections as well as the dignity , clarity , security and power of the word ' marriage			2
' " @entity88 said last week that he supports letting states decide the issue of same - sex marriage on their own , but added that he was " disappointed " by last tuesday 's vote on the issue in @entity126 , where a ban on same - sex marriage was added to the state constitution			1
@entity88 believes the amendment is discriminatory against gays and lesbians , a spokesman said wednesday			0
five @entity135 states allow civil unions for same - sex couples , but not marriage			1
six states -- @entity140 , @entity141 , @entity142 , @entity103 , @entity143 and @entity144 -- and the @entity146 issue marriage licenses to same - sex couples , while 31 states have voted in favor of constitutional amendments that seek to define marriage as a heterosexual union			1
in february , @entity153 gov. @entity152 signed a bill that would legalize same - sex marriage beginning in june , but opponents there have pledged to block the bill and called for voters to decide the issue			1
@entity162 gov. @entity161 signed into law a bill that permits the state 's same - sex couples to wed as of january 1 , and state residents may vote to affirm such a law			1
@entity169 will vote on a state constitutional amendment similar to the one in @entity126 , while @entity171 will have a referendum on allowing same - sex marriage			2
meanwhile , two cases seeking to overturn laws forbidding the practice , one from @entity176 and another from @entity140 , could be headed to the @entity135 @entity177 in coming months			0
@entity0 's @entity178 contributed to this report .			0
