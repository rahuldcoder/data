@entity0 @entity0 on a normal day is not easy to manage			1
throw in @entity2 , a mass for six million people and some rain , and you can expect some disorder and confusion			1
however , what i experienced showed me the better side of what @entity12 and the @entity12 can be			1
before the @entity19 , the streets lining the main boulevard where the pope 's motorcades would pass en route to @entity18 , were already lined thick with people who had arrived by dawn , hoping to catch a glimpse of the pontiff			1
" the pope is a human saint -- when we see him our problems go away , " said 35 - year - old @entity24			1
@entity28 , 54 , who had followed the @entity2 to every event in @entity0 said that , even if he did not manage to see him personally , he feels he 'd feel " blessed " just to be near him			1
" for me , he is the super pope because he is very human and helpful			1
i want to follow his example			0
and he is the ultimate guide to the path to heaven , " @entity28 explained			0
ex-street kid weeps as she asks @entity2 why @entity36 lets children suffer when the @entity39 finally drove by , the air was filled with cheers , jubilant screams and applause			1
fifteen - year old @entity43 told me , " i felt happy , even if just for a moment			1
i saw him smiling , waving his hands at us			0
i know he probably wo n't remember but i will remember him			0
" for a hot and humid country used to heavy tropical rain , standing outside in the elements for hours did n't seem to be a problem			1
soaking wet by lunchtime , everyone was still smiling and happy			0
@entity55 , 55 , who had stood in the rain for five hours , explained , " i feel like it 's shining , it 's really warm			2
i do n't feel the rain			2
" the weather also brought out the @entity12 ' innate creativity and resourcefulness ; having listened to the advisory against bringing umbrellas , those who did not have raincoats wore every form of plastic imaginable			1
people protected their heads with towels , helmets and even shower caps , and bubble wrap and trash bags were fashioned into scarves , hats , shirts and overdresses			2
thousands of faithful , having found the main venue packed to capacity , wandered around the carnival - like atmosphere , passing souvenir and snack vendors , and people waving porcelain , wood or ceramic religious figures , in search of somewhere to stand and pray			2
at times , the massive flow of people pushed me into a crowd moving in two directions at once with enough room to move only inches forward at a time			2
but despite this , people remained kind and helpful			0
when i found it impossible to shoot a colleague on video because throngs of people were passing by nonstop , one lady offered to hold my umbrella over the camera , and another volunteered to direct people around us as we filmed			0
no matter where you looked on nearby @entity110 , usually a traffic - filled main artery , the spirit in the air was ordered and peaceful			2
hundreds of thousands of people lined up calmly behind police barricades before , during and after the @entity19 , showing a patience and humility that made me proud			0
they were here , united in purpose , because they believed , and faith knows no clock			0
from the altar , surrounded by screens , the @entity2 told the massive congregation that @entity36 " created the world as a beautiful garden and asked us to care for it			1
" @entity136 , he said , through sin , " man has also destroyed the unity and beauty of our human family , creating social structures which perpetuate poverty , ignorance and corruption			0
" the people around me said they hoped the @entity2 's visit would start to heal what one lady described as the " illness of the country			1
" @entity144 , a high school teacher said , " our government officials should have the integrity and the wisdom to govern our country well without corruption without taking advantage of small people , the simple people			2
" seaman @entity55 , 55 , proudly carrying a carved " @entity154 " icon in his arm , offered another prayer			0
" i hope he can help with poverty , those who are having a hard time			0
they need jobs , better living conditions , and a better future for our children			0
" as the majestic sound of the church singing echoed through the streets , i looked at the silent faces of those bowing their heads in contemplation			2
i could not but feel a sense of unity in the moment			0
@entity175 , a 65 - year old retired @entity176 officer who traveled 13 hours by bus to see the @entity2 , said : " today i feel there is peace and tranquility among @entity12 people or any other race present here at this moment			1
it should be carried on			0

around six million @entity187 crowd @entity0 streets to glimpse the @entity2
spirits were high as followers *sheltered* from rain in plastic hats , coats
