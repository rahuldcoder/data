@entity1 's story , which is the focus of the first episode of @entity4 's documentary series , " @entity5 , " shows that the capital punishment system does not always get it right			1
like @entity1 , i know this first - hand			2
i was the first person in the @entity8 to be exonerated from death row because of dna testing			1
in 1984 , i was 23 years old , newly married and living in @entity11 , @entity12			2
i had just served four years in the @entity13			2
i had never been arrested			2
this all changed on august 9 , 1984 , when the police knocked on my door at 3 a.m. and arrested me for the murder of 9 - year - old @entity18			1
in a matter of days i became the most hated man in @entity12			2
on july 25 , 1984 , @entity21 was raped and murdered in @entity22			0
a man approached @entity21 and offered to help her find her friend in their game of hide - and - seek			0
her body was found in the park later that afternoon			1
the police were eager to find the girl 's killer and ease the community 's fear			0
despite the fact that i did not match witnesses ' descriptions of the man who approached @entity21 , an anonymous caller suggested my name to the @entity43			1
there was no physical evidence against me			1
during the trial , i was convicted primarily on the testimony of five witnesses who were later shown to be terribly mistaken			1
it took the jury less than three hours to convict me			0
when they announced my death sentence , the courtroom erupted in applause			1
life at the @entity56 can only be described as @entity57			1
i still have nightmares about it			0
my cell was directly under the gas chamber			0
the guards thought it was funny to remind me of that fact			0
they would describe the entire procedure in detail and laugh at my fate			0
fortunately , a second trial reduced my punishment to back - to - back life sentences			1
i fought to stay safe at the penitentiary and spent long days in the prison library			1
at the time of my first trial , dna testing was not a well - understood concept in criminal law			1
in 1992 , i came across a book about dna testing used to solve murders in @entity80			1
my attorney , @entity81 , submitted a request for the evidence in my case to be tested			1
the prosecutor almost brought my innocence claim to a halt when she sent a letter with a devastating message : the biological material in my case was inadvertently destroyed			0
miraculously , the judge from my second trial had decided to keep some of the physical evidence and store it in his chambers			1
one day in 1993 i received a phone call from my attorney			0
the stain lifted from the victim 's underpants did not match my dna			1
the dna told the truth : i was not guilty of this crime			2
unfortunately , it would take 10 more years for @entity21 's true killer to be identified			0
on june 28 , 1993 , i walked out of the @entity56 a free man			0
my re-entry into society was not easy			0
when i returned to @entity11 , i had trouble getting a job			0
i was harassed by my neighbors			0
the @entity12 paid me $ 300,000 for lost income during the time i was wrongfully imprisoned , but i lost so much more than money in those eight years			0
during my 21 years of freedom , i have become one of many exonerees who , with the help of advocacy organizations like @entity120 , travel around the world to share our cautionary tales			0
even people acting in good faith can make serious mistakes			0
witness misidentification is one of the leading causes of wrongful convictions in the @entity8			1
since 1989 , dna evidence has been used to exonerate more than 300 individuals in capital and non-capital cases			1
approximately 75 % of these cases involved inaccurate or faulty witness identification			0
i am living proof that @entity8 's system of capital punishment is broken beyond repair			1
more and more people are realizing this			0
in a 2013 @entity145 poll , support for the death penalty dropped to 60 % , the lowest level in 40 years			2
@entity12 abolished the death penalty in 2013 , the sixth state in six years to do so			2
concerns about innocence , unfairness and other issues have led to a dramatic decline in death sentences and executions since the 1990s , according to the @entity156			2
the death penalty is fading away , but in my view , the end of capital punishment in the @entity8 can not come quickly enough			1
i am not here because the system worked			2
i am here -- like @entity1 is still here -- because of a series of miracles			0
not every person wrongfully convicted of a capital crime is as lucky .			2

@entity170 : i was first in @entity8 sentenced to death row to be exonerated by dna evidence
witnesses , not physical evidence , tied him to rape , murder
life in prison hell on earth . he found book on dna testing , lawyer *pursued* , he was freed
@entity187 : end capital punishment . i am proof that system is broken beyond repair
