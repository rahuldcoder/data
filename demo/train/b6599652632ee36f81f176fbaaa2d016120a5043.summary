on paper , the 1974 version of " @entity1 " had everything			1
it starred @entity5 , the biggest , most glamorous movie star of the era			0
the screenplay was by @entity8 , coming off writing @entity9 for " @entity10 " and " @entity11			0
" the art direction was sumptuous , and the costumes -- which helped launch a new craze for 1920s - inspired fashion -- were designed by the then little - known @entity16 , among others			1
and yet the movie , though a box - office success , fell far short of the novel			1
critics at the time roasted it , and it 's been largely forgotten since its release			2
there are lots of reasons that the 1974 " gatsby " has n't become a film classic equal to the book 's literary status			1
the actors were , perhaps , miscast : redford a little too perfect given @entity1 's rough edges , @entity34 too unpolished for rich @entity36 @entity35			1
director @entity37 may have paid more attention to the opulent settings than the relationships between the characters			0
and then there 's the shadow of @entity44 himself , with his lyrical language , so enticing on the page and so difficult to translate onto celluloid			1
but @entity49 has n't given up			0
like the green light across the bay that forever taunts the book 's title character , @entity55 @entity44 's classic 1925 novel holds out the promise of a dream : turning the @entity58 into the @entity59			1
after all , it has everything -- a love story , sex , money , crime , great themes , lush settings			0
the latest attempt , a 3 - d version starring @entity70 and directed by " @entity71 's " @entity72 , opens friday			1
@entity72 has steeped himself in both @entity44 and the @entity73			0
he immersed himself in @entity44 's biography			2
he read previous drafts of the novel			0
he even has a reason for using rock and hip - hop music on his soundtrack : the seemingly anachronistic sounds are the equivalent of jazz in the novel 's 1922 setting , when the music was " referred to as an @entity87 fad , " the director told @entity89			1
but does it matter ? is " @entity1 , " finally , that dreaded word in @entity49 -- " unfilmable " ? " the language in ' @entity1 ' is almost like poetry , " says @entity92 , emeritus film professor at @entity93			1
" how do you translate that into cinematic terms ? " entertainment vs. high school it 's never easy			2
novels and motion pictures are distinct forms of storytelling , points out @entity107 's @entity106 , who helped produce the films " precious , " " 127 hours " and the current " @entity109			2
" a book takes place largely in the reader 's imagination ; a movie makes concrete choices , down to the casting			1
moreover , it can be tough for a film to translate the internal thoughts of characters and narrators into action -- turning subtext into text , in other words			0
@entity126 , an @entity127 professor at @entity128 , says he admires the film version of " @entity130 " for taking @entity132 ' passive butler and turning him into a fascinating film character			2
" the ( actors ) could bring that inner turmoil into sight nonverbally , " he says			2
" it 's a pretty big risk to write that as a movie			2
" still , says @entity106 , any literary work can be made into a film , given the right hands			0
if there 's a risk , he observes , it 's when filmmakers adhere too closely to a classic or popular book , resulting in an airless dramatization -- not a full - bodied film			1
" there 's a danger that it can be perceived as something that 's good for you , " he says			2
" films work best when they 're extremely entertaining			0
an audience might look at a film that 's adapted from a novel and think that they 're in a high school class			2
" indeed , it 's a @entity49 truism that some of the best movies are made from energetic potboilers			1
" @entity10 " is usually @entity164 : a fine , pulpy novel turned into a great film thanks to @entity8 's attention to theme , photography and character			2
nevertheless , certain producers have been particularly eager to snap up prestigious literary properties and worry about the cinematic issues later			0
@entity174 , in particular , is well - known for his literary tastes , having optioned @entity177 's " @entity176 , " @entity179 's " @entity180 , " @entity181 's " @entity182 " and @entity183 's " @entity178 " over the years			1
not all of them have worked out , however			0
how to throw a 1920s party worthy of @entity1 himself adapting to challenges indeed , it 's not just literary pedigree that may make a book " unfilmable			1
" moviemakers may be wary of subject matter , technological challenges , even the mood			0
a talked - about book might only sell 50,000 copies ; a movie has to sell millions of tickets			1
so there 's a reason @entity49 took the tragic ending of " @entity203 " and turned it into a scene of feel - good fireworks			1
who , besides a bunch of hubris - fascinated @entity127 majors , wants to see the book 's ( spoiler ! ) fallen , weeping @entity214 " excluded from the game and all his records forever destroyed " ? those challenges need not be a death sentence at the box office or with critics , however			1
" @entity203 " had a successful run			0
@entity221 's version of " @entity222 " eliminated a symbolic suckling scene , toned down the politics , changed the ending and became a classic			1
@entity177 's brutal " @entity176 " is full of horrific violence ( not to mention the author 's distinctive terse writing )			2
yet the @entity230 managed to make an oscar winner out of the material , helped in no small way by @entity235 's chilling performance as @entity236			1
" @entity239 , " " @entity240 , " " @entity241 , " " @entity242 " -- all had their issues , whether cultural , literary or technological , and all ended up successful and award - winning films			2
the key is that everybody has to be on the same page ( pardon the pun ) , says screenwriter @entity247 , who 's adapted works by authors such as @entity250			2
" for the best adaptations , you have a partnership , " says @entity247 , who teaches at @entity251 in @entity252			0
moviemaking is a team effort , and if the screenwriter , director and producer are at loggerheads , the final product will suffer , she says			0
and you have to follow your own muse , she adds			0
@entity247 's original work , including books for young adults , is far different from @entity269 's romances , and she knew she 'd have to make @entity269 's melodramatic dialogue more film - friendly			1
" but , " she says , " i was convinced i could tell the story			0
" marketing muscle which brings us back to " @entity1			1
" @entity72 has the creative partnerships : @entity279 @entity278 wrote the screenplay and @entity72 's wife , @entity281 , tackled the production design			0
he 's tried a different angle , getting at " @entity1 's " famous distance by making @entity1 's character -- now in a sanitarium -- the novelist			1
and , not unimportantly , he has the marketing muscle			0
after all , a primary reason @entity49 keeps adapting certain novels is the built - in sales factor			0
" gatsby " is on countless high school reading lists and sells hundreds of thousands of copies a year			0
there 's a curious audience already waiting			0
in addition , the book is being backed by a marketing blitz that would make @entity44 , a former advertising man , proud			1
@entity300 , @entity301 , hotels , even an ice - cream manufacturer have climbed aboard the " gatsby " bandwagon			1
will all that appeal to a summer movie audience generally filled with teenagers ? it 's certainly shrewd , says @entity309 , a film and media studies professor at @entity312			0
" as i watched the trailer , i thought , ' this is for 16 - year - olds , ' " she says			0
" all of this is about gearing this toward high school and college students who may not have any notion of who @entity44 was or what the book actually was			0
" they 're not going to care too much about whether this is a well - done adaptation , " she adds			1
" they 're going to care about whether it 's a @entity49 blockbuster			0

new version of " @entity1 " one of many attempts to bring classic to the screen
book 's lyrical prose , point of view make adaptation difficult
movies are different art form , and filmmakers have to remember that , says producer
" gatsby " *benefits* from well - known title , marketing ties
