-- residents of the @entity2 in south - central @entity3 , already urged to evacuate , late thursday awaited a formal decision on whether a spillway will be opened , sending millions of gallons of floodwaters their way			1
the @entity9 is measuring the current flow of the @entity11 at a river landing , and once it reaches a specified volume and velocity the @entity13 may make a decision on the @entity17			1
the move would help divert water from @entity21 and @entity22 , but it would send a torrent down the @entity24 , gov. @entity18 said			0
he has advised residents in southeastern @entity3 to evacuate their homes , urging , " do n't wait for the official notification			1
" @entity18 said thursday that state officials need several days after a @entity30 decision to notify residents			0
a decision on the spillway 's opening could come between saturday and tuesday , officials said			2
@entity36 , meanwhile , continued to analyze multiple @entity11 scenarios , depending on whether the spillway is closed , open or partially open			1
the @entity39 said floodwaters could close the @entity11 to ships at the port of @entity22 as early as monday morning , according to a spokesman			1
@entity44 , @entity11 , police chief @entity45 said 600 residents had been evacuated as of thursday night			1
the @entity11 is expected to crest may 19 at 57.5 feet			1
@entity45 said he expected higher water friday , with more homes affected			2
more than two dozen roads were closed and about 45 businesses will be closed by friday			0
across the @entity53 and lower @entity54 , floodwaters have covered about 3 million acres of farmland , eroding for many farmers what could have been a profitable year for corn , wheat , rice and cotton , officials said thursday			1
in @entity63 , the @entity62 estimated that damage to the state 's agriculture could top more than $ 500 million as more than 1 million acres of cropland are under water			1
" it 's in about 10 feet of water , " @entity70 , @entity71 , farmer @entity69 said of his 440 acres of winter wheat , which was to be harvested in the coming month			2
other farmers in @entity11 , @entity77 , @entity71 and @entity63 rushed to salvage what wheat they could ahead of the rising water			1
as for corn , farmers who were able to get into the fields during a soggy planting season in late march and april are seeing their crops in some cases under several feet of water			0
farms near and on the @entity11 are no strangers to flooding , but the 2011 flood is definitely one for the record books			1
" this is new water that has reached areas for the first time in 75 years , " said @entity92 of the @entity93			0
of course , the flooding is covering more than farmland			1
in @entity3 alone , @entity18 said , as many as 3 million acres -- of farms , forests and towns -- could be affected			1
in @entity11 , 600,000 acres of farmland are only part of 1.4 million acres likely to be flooded , said @entity105 of the state 's @entity106			1
with the overflowing @entity11 bearing down on @entity22 , where the water level was already at flood stage , the @entity9 said thursday that it was opening more bays at the @entity111			1
another 113 bays were opened , bringing the total to 223 open bays , authorities said			0
the 350 - bay spillway , just north of @entity22 , diverts water into @entity118			2
the @entity119 said that as of thursday night , the river was at 17 feet in @entity22 , about an inch and a half above flood stage			0
it is expected to crest on may 23 at more than 19 feet			0
" nobody can wrap their heads around what 's going to happen , " said @entity125 of @entity21			0
in a @entity130 from her hometown , where the 19 - year - old is on summer break from college , she said , " i 've never seen the river anywhere near where it is now			0
" the @entity137 is working around the clock to construct a flood barrier in @entity140 , @entity3			1
in @entity141 , which endured a record river crest this week , flooding affected between 800 and 1,000 properties , said @entity144 of the local emergency management agency			1
many small businesses and farms were affected in @entity148 , and the river level was still high thursday , he said			2
@entity150 moved into the area thursday night , according to county officials , and @entity148 residents were being reminded about five shelters			0
" many people who chose to stay in their homes during the flood are now surrounded by floodwater and are in need of food and other supplies , " the @entity155 said			0
some @entity141 roads remained closed , and an unspecified number of customers wo n't see power restoration for several days			0
flooding also continues to be a problem in southeastern @entity77 and southern @entity169 , though the @entity11 and @entity171 rivers have crested in those states			1
several roads were closed thursday in @entity11			2
back in @entity3 , " the @entity111 was partially opened on monday ... in order to keep the volume of the @entity11 flows at @entity22 from exceeding 1.25 million cubic feet per second , " the @entity9 said			1
but the muddy water exceeded that level , with a flow of 1.36 million cubic feet per second by wednesday night , authorities said			2
twenty - six parishes in the state have declared states of emergency ahead of the surging waters			2
a nuclear unit in @entity3 may have to shut down if @entity11 levels are too high , according to the @entity187			1
the @entity188 3 , about 25 miles west of @entity22 , was back online thursday after being shut april 6 to refuel and replace the main generator			0
@entity190 , which owns the plant , said flooding is not expected with the opening of the @entity111			2
but if the river exceeds 27 feet , the plant would be forced to shut down because a circulating water system that drives the turbine would not be able to operate			0
throughout the region , the economic toll has yet to be calculated			0
in @entity11 's @entity201 , rising water shut down lucrative casinos that generate $ 85 million a month in taxes			1
" we 've created a barrier around the perimeter of the casino and hotel , " said @entity204 , general manager of the @entity205			0
" as of now , we remain dry inside that perimeter			0
" the emotional toll of a long - running natural disaster can be hard to gauge , said @entity214 with the @entity215 in @entity11			2
" emotional care is going to be just as much of a need as someplace to sleep and a warm meal to eat , " she said			0
" we 're still at a point where it 's not time to panic , but it is time to prepare , and that 's how we 're going to get to the finish line of this arduous marathon			0
" fourteen @entity11 counties affected by flooding have been declared major disaster areas eligible for federal assistance , gov. @entity227 announced wednesday in a statement released by his office			1
" we are grateful to @entity236 ( @entity235 ) @entity234 and @entity237 for quickly fulfilling our request for assistance , " @entity227 said			0
" the flooding situation will last for several weeks , and this declaration gives @entity242 in flooded areas access to federal assistance that can help families through this difficult time			2
" @entity0 's @entity247 , @entity248 , @entity249 , @entity250 and @entity251 contributed to this report .			0
