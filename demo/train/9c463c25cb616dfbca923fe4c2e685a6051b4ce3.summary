during @entity1 's " @entity0 : @entity4 " coverage , we 've asked businesses to tell us how they balance the imperative for profit with environmental concerns			1
first up is the co-founder of @entity11 - based @entity10 , @entity12 , whose business packages cubic zirconia diamonds in an environmental wrapping			1
growing up surrounded by generations of jewelry wearing tradition , i was drawn to the brilliance and transparency of diamonds from an early age			1
later , it was the fact that diamonds are a unique resource , evoking beauty and eternal love that lead me to found @entity10			1
@entity27 co-founded @entity10 with her husband @entity28			0
however , as i began to learn beyond the basics and beauty of diamonds , i began to discover the many environmental and ethical issues related to them			1
and the once simple wish to create a line of exquisite diamond jewelry grew into a mission -- to create an ecologically and ethically correct jewelry brand			0
i was one of many who were understandably concerned to learn that jewelry they had as a symbol of love may have come at a terrible human and environmental cost			0
although the social and ethical issues associated with conflict diamonds were the impetus at the core of the @entity10 philosophy , the serious environmental impacts of the diamond industry could not be ignored			1
there 's an undeniable link between the degradation of our global environment and consumer culture			2
the trouble is that these days , things are so nicely packaged , presented and displayed that we hardly ever question how the raw materials used to produce the goods are extracted and processed			0
we rarely think of how it all affects the environment and humankind			0
it 's impossible to assess exactly how much devastation one single diamond could have caused before it was cut , polished , set and sold at a high - end retailer			2
it 's hard to imagine what a diamond mine looks like by looking at the " stunning sparklers " that are neatly displayed in shop windows			2
somewhere along the way it became irrelevant to question the true cost of the stones			0
diamond mining practices are not without huge ecological impacts			1
whether extracted from a large - scale diamond mine using modern , clinical mining methods , or through small - scale artisanal alluvial diamond digging , the diamond industry faces environmental challenges just as with any mineral extraction			2
land disturbance , which involves the shifting of large quantities of soil from the earth , is interlinked with issues of waste and water pollution as well as huge impacts on biodiversity			1
through my company , i knew i could offer an alternative to mined - diamond jewelry of equal beauty and quality -- using lab - created jewels and meticulous craftsmanship -- jewelry that evoked beauty and eternal love , and that was truly transparent			0
as with any environmental or ethical issue , education , knowledge and action are the keys to ending unnecessary harm			0
so , as the business grew , we made sure each of our customers received an info - leaflet with every purchase			0
we began donating proceeds from our sales to grassroots organizations that ran mine - reclamation projects promoting organic farming and biodiversity in mining towns in @entity127 , a country devastated by civil war that was fueled by diamonds and now has a landscape scarred by indiscriminate alluvial diamond mining			1
we began monitoring the working conditions at our workshop , and looking for more sustainable methods of packaging and delivering our jewelry			0
we found that our customers were happy to be a part of a solution and not the problem			2
the economic downturn , combined with an increasing awareness of the ecological and ethical facts surrounding diamonds , has meant an increase in customers who appreciate affordable luxury without any attached guilt			1
there 's no doubt that the choices we make and the actions we take today affect the fate of our planet and in turn our well being			2
with shifting consumer behavior and a changing economic and environmental climate , the time has come where being environmentally conscious is an imperative for all individuals and businesses alike .			0
