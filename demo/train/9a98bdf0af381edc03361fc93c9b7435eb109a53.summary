-- could the tragedy of @entity2 have been the result of human intervention , as many have speculated ? for argument 's sake , let 's begin with an act of terrorism originating from the cabin of the airplane			1
making the assumption that an individual , or group of individuals , gained access to the cockpit through a keypad - coded , @entity21 door , how was it done ? perhaps entry was gained shortly after the now - famous , " all right , good night , " message from the co-pilot 40 minutes into the flight			1
theoretically , one of the pilots stepped out for a lavatory break ... or stepped back in from a lavatory break			2
terrorists rushed into the cockpit at the very moment the door was opened , an action that had to be well - orchestrated			2
such an action would require at least two people positioned in the first class cabin to observe the open door			0
one terrorist would have to disable the pilot and another terrorist would have to rush into the cockpit			1
with the terrorists in control of the cockpit , they would direct the remaining pilot to steer the airplane on a new course			1
or the terrorists themselves had enough piloting skills to fly the airplane			0
in addition , inside knowledge beyond that of even experienced 777 pilots would have been necessary to locate the @entity58 unit from within the depths of the electronics and engineering ( @entity61 ) compartment in order to disable it such that the system no longer was capable of sending automatic data ; notwithstanding the logistics of pulling up a portion of the first class galley carpet to gain access to the @entity61 hatch while using some type of threat to prevent passengers from impeding their progress			2
why pick that moment ? where are they going exactly ? surely , aiming for the middle of the @entity80 does n't accomplish their task to make some type of statement			0
and if one considers a botched hijacking attempt , how would a group of terrorists fail that badly ? for that matter , how could one or a number of crazed terrorists disable a whole 777 to the point it runs out of fuel ? a 9/11 scenario with the passengers attempting to disable the terrorists likely would n't continue for seven hours			0
and oh , by the way , information disseminated publicly seems to indicate that none of the passengers had suspicious backgrounds			0
next , consider the theories that cast one or both of the pilots as the villain			1
if both pilots participated , a carefully crafted plot between the two would have been constructed			1
no evidence of such a plot has been forthcoming			2
besides , this would have required some type of connection between the captain and the co-pilot beyond their airline employment			0
no extracurricular connection between the two pilots has been publicly established			0
eliminating the two - pilot conspiracy , then only one would have commandeered the airplane			0
but how would that pilot have disabled the other ? a struggle ? would the commandeering pilot have prevented the other pilot from reentering the cockpit after a lavatory break ? then what ? both the captain and co-pilot were equally qualified to fly the 777			1
if the erratic climbs and descents reported concerning the plane are credible , why the gyrations ? although transport category airplanes are sensitive to hand flying at high altitudes , only an amateur would demonstrate that lack of skill			0
and to what end would one of the pilots want to seize a 777 ? once again , would the purpose really be to run the airplane out of fuel in the middle of the @entity80 ? how about suicide ? death by airplane seems farfetched in this case			0
why wait till the middle of the ocean to make a statement ? why not attempt suicide immediately after takeoff ... or just prior to landing in @entity156 ? was human intervention involved ? absolutely			1
but my gut theory as a 30 - year airline veteran is that human intervention was involved to save an airplane and its passengers in crisis , not to commit foul play .			1

pilot @entity167 *doubts* theories that hijackers or pilots brought down @entity2
he says if human intervention occurred , it was likely to try to save the plane , not to doom it
@entity178 : there 's no clue of a plot involving both pilots , and it would likely take both
he says hijackers would have had *touble* getting into cockpit and disabling *equipment*
