@entity0 opened the @entity2 's first safe house for abused women and children in west @entity5 in 1971			1
back then , domestic violence was still thought of as a private issue , to be dealt with behind closed doors			1
it was shrouded in myth and misunderstanding			2
fast forward 42 years -- and sadly , it seems that very little has changed			0
domestic violence takes place every single day , in households across the globe			1
people often think that it only happens in poor families , but the truth is that domestic violence affects women of all ages , classes and backgrounds			1
abusive men are as likely to be lawyers , accountants and judges as they are cleaners or unemployed			0
sometimes domestic violence is kept hidden , perpetrated in ways that are difficult to spot to the outside world			1
many women have told me that their abusers hit them on parts of their body that do not show , or only become violent when the children are asleep			0
they tell me that their partners are very charming to other people -- a ' true gentleman ' or an ' all - round nice guy '			0
but sometimes domestic violence spills out into the public arena			1
abusive men may humiliate their partners in front of friends and family , putting them down , belittling everything they say			0
sometimes they use physical force or gestures to intimidate and control their partners in social settings			0
in these situations , women may try to appease their partners to defuse the situation and reduce the risk of violence			1
in 2003 , @entity0 conducted a survey of 1,000 @entity2 households which found that 42 % of people had witnessed someone being verbally or physically abused by their partner in a social situation			1
all too often , however , people respond to this type of incident by turning a blind eye			0
they do n't call the police			0
they still regard domestic violence as a ' private ' matter			1
shockingly , these attitudes are all too often echoed by the police , social workers and criminal justice professionals -- the very people who have a duty to safeguard the most vulnerable members of our society			0
police officers still fail to treat domestic violence as a serious crime			1
reports of abuse are routinely dismissed , calls for help are downgraded , and dangerous men are left free to commit violence -- or worse			1
refuge is currently working with the family of @entity94 -- a young woman from @entity96 , eastern @entity97 , who was brutally killed by her ex-partner @entity98 in 2008 , despite making repeated calls for help to the police ( @entity98 , who had been convicted of murdering another woman , was later convicted of @entity94 's murder )			0
together , we are calling on the @entity2 government to open a public inquiry into the response of the police and other state agencies to domestic violence victims			1
the truth is that domestic violence is a massive social problem			1
last year , over one million women were abused in the @entity2 , according to @entity2 government statistics			2
every week in @entity97 and @entity118 , two women are killed by current or former partners			0
domestic violence is a crime			1
it is against the law			0
by failing to speak out against domestic violence , we condone it			1
we give violent men social permission to continue their abuse			2
by failing to speak out against domestic violence we also mirror the techniques used by perpetrators , who frequently try to deny or minimise their own behaviour			1
they may attribute their violence to things like alcohol or stress			2
they may blame the victim , saying that she ' provoked ' or ' deserved ' the abuse			2
the truth is that violence is always a choice			2
no woman is responsible for her abuser 's actions			0
i have worked with survivors of domestic violence for 35 years			1
i know that domestic violence is rarely a one - off			1
we should never ignore that first slap or shove , because over time it can escalate into much worse			0
in extreme cases , domestic violence can be fatal			1
it 's important that we recognise the signs of abuse at the earliest opportunities , and help women to get support before the violence escalates			2
research shows that strangulation is a key risk factor for domestic homicide			2
last year , almost 50 % of the women refuge supported had been strangled or choked by their abusers			0
of course , in many cases , perpetrators do n't use physical violence at all			2
emotional abuse can be just as devastating as kicks and punches			2
the scars it leaves can be deeper , and take longer to heal			0
if a woman lives in a state of fear , changing her behaviour to avoid making her partner angry , she is being abused			0
domestic violence is not a private issue			1
it is a social issue			0
it is a political issue			0
it is a moral issue			0
above all , it 's a crime -- a crime as serious as any other violent crime			0
domestic violence affects us all			1
we all have a part to play in ending it .			0
