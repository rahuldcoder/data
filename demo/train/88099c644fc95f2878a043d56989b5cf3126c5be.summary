those afflicted often bleed uncontrollably , vomit profusely , lose function of their kidneys and other organs , and -- in over half the cases recently in @entity7 -- die			2
so faced with the prospect of coming face - to - face with this terrible illness at their @entity14 hospital , where its first documented @entity0 cases ever are soon set to arrive , what did two nurses do ? they canceled their vacation			1
" they said , ' we have been training for this , ' " dr. @entity18 , who heads the @entity20 unit where the two @entity21 with @entity0 will be treated , told @entity23 chief medical correspondent dr. @entity22 -- himself a neurosurgery professor at @entity20			1
" ' we are not going to miss this opportunity to care for this patient			0
" online and on street corners , in homes and in businesses , the idea of purposefully bringing @entity0 into the @entity21 has rattled the nerves of many			1
@entity0 coming to @entity21 for first time there is lots of evidence of this sentiment on @entity40 , where some opined that " we 're being very foolish " -- and that 's one of the kinder remarks			1
" why willingly bring infected ebola victims to this country ? " wrote one woman			0
" why purposely spread the infection ? " but you wo n't hear that kind of thing at @entity20			1
according to @entity18 , it 's been just the opposite			2
" as i came in this morning , i had people congratulating us for accepting these patients			0
" they know how the virus spreads yes , @entity0 in the @entity21 is unprecedented			1
but that does n't mean experts do n't know anything about it			0
talking to reporters friday , @entity18 said that @entity0 spreads much like @entity62 , @entity63 or c -- through the transmission of bodily fluids , not by simply being in the same room as someone infected			1
it 's not like someone is contagious the second they are infected			2
the virus does n't spread until that person shows symptoms , which typically takes two to 21 days , according to the @entity76			0
those working at @entity20 also can take comfort in that they have a unique place -- one of only four such facilities in the @entity21 , according to @entity18 -- to treat such a contagious disease			1
what you need to know the isolation unit was created 12 years ago in conjunction with experts from the @entity21 @entity89 , which is based down the street			1
it features " special air handling , " strict protocols on everything and everyone who goes in and out of a patient 's room , and other measures to ensure that any potential dangers are contained			2
everything is thought out , right down to how visitors can interact with patients			0
they can be within 1 to 2 inches of each other , looking through a plate - glass window and talking through an intercom			0
it 's a unique facility that 's rarely used			1
@entity18 said it was last activated a couple of years ago , when someone came from @entity110 amid a marburg virus outbreak			0
" it 's kind of like an insurance policy , " the @entity20 physician said			1
" you can complain about the fact that you did n't collect on your ... policy or you can say -- as in this case -- ' boy , we 're lucky we 've been supporting you all these years because now we really need you			0
' and it would be really challenging to develop this on the fly			0
" giving the body a chance to fight back the renowned hospital 's wide variety of tools will be put to ample use given how @entity0 -- without the existence of any @entity132 - approved treatments -- will be addressed at @entity20 : using what @entity18 calls " supportive care			1
" that means carefully tracking a patient 's symptoms , vital signs and organ function and taking measures , such as blood transfusions and dialysis , to keep him or her as stable as possible			2
" we just have to keep the patient alive long enough in order for the body to control this infection , " @entity18 explained			0
what the @entity20 doctor does n't have , as @entity21 patients @entity151 and dr. @entity153 arrive for treatment at his hospital , is hesitation or trepidation			1
@entity18 told reporters he has " no concerns " about his health or that of his colleagues			0
another person who also did n't express any worry was @entity18 's wife			2
" my wife knew when she was getting into when she married an infectious disease doctor ... it went fine , " he said of his conversation with his wife			2
" she said , ' @entity172 , that 's what you 've been dreaming for 12 years			0
' " ebola doctor in @entity176 dies			0

two americans with @entity0 are being *transported* to @entity14 hospital

idea of bringing @entity0 into the @entity21 has *frightened* some , but not at @entity20
