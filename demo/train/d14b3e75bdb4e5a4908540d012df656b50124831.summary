-- @entity1 showed up in court last week , finally , nearly three years after the @entity4 disaster and the hell it unleashed on the @entity6			1
it 's a huge , high - stakes trial , and @entity1 is taking the beating it 's earned			1
here 's what 's at stake for @entity12 if there is a judgment : potentially tens of billions of dollars that will be used to create jobs while restoring some of our most productive and vulnerable natural places			1
whether the trial results in a decision or a settlement , the outcome will send a signal about how serious this country is about enforcing its common - sense rules that guarantee clean air and waters			1
@entity1 and its partners have already confessed to criminal negligence in the 2010 blowout that killed 11 men and gushed nearly 5 million barrels of oil			1
every part of the @entity36 ecosystem , from the deep - sea corals to dolphins to migratory birds , was affected			0
@entity6 residents suffered billions of dollars in economic losses , with effects that rippled across the country			1
and despite those slick commercials that assure you all is well and then invite you to spend your tourism dollars on the @entity6 , the disaster is still unfolding			1
last summer , scientists found traces of @entity1 's oil and dispersant in the eggs of migratory white pelicans nesting all the way up in @entity55			1
oil is still present on the @entity6 's beaches , in the marshes and under the water			1
it is working its way through the food chain , so it will be years before we understand the full extent of the disaster			0
@entity1 's billions at stake as courtroom showdown starts just wednesday , in fact , the @entity68 documented a fresh rash of tarballs on a @entity73 beach known as @entity74 -- a spot that gets re-oiled every time a storm stirs up @entity1 's submerged goo			1
we 're nearly three years in , and there 's no end in sight			0
that 's why our justice system must hold @entity1 and other polluters fully responsible under the law for the worst offshore oil disaster in history			1
how much could @entity1 end up paying ? @entity1 is liable for up to $ 17.6 billion in penalties under the @entity88 if it is found grossly negligent			2
( and if this is n't gross negligence , it 's hard to imagine what is			0
) add to that figure the potential for tens of billions more in fines under the @entity96			2
this much is clear : the rules were put in place to deter and , if needed , to penalize the offenders			0
the @entity4 was the kind of disaster that was envisioned when the full force of these penalties was contemplated			0
those penalties -- and nothing short -- are the fair outcome			0
it was n't surprising to see @entity1 's stock rise when it agreed to an unprecedented $ 4.5 billion in criminal fines			2
the market was saying , in essence : guys , it could have been a lot worse			0
@entity1 claims it now leads the way on safety so we know that some amount of penalties -- a staggering amount by normal standards -- has already been " priced in " to @entity1 's value			2
so , this is n't about whether @entity1 will continue to be an atm for shareholders			2
and we 're not saying that there should n't be drilling in the @entity6			2
we 're saying that even megacorporations need to play by the rules			0
if @entity130 lawyers agree to a weak settlement , the burden of rebuilding from this disaster will be transferred from a foreign corporation to @entity12 taxpayers			2
worse , it will send a message to polluters that we do n't take seriously our air , water , wildlife , communities or economic health			1
what 's the difference between a $ 15 billion settlement and a $ 35 billion dollar judgment ? the ability to rebuild the @entity73 wetlands -- @entity12 's delta -- for generations to come			1
a healthy , productive @entity6 where people and wildlife thrive			0
the principle that if you break it , you buy it			0
families of killed rig workers react to @entity1 settlement under the terms of the @entity159 -- passed last year with historic bipartisan support -- 80 % of @entity88 civil penalties will go back to restore the environment and economies of the @entity6 states			1
that 's right and fair			0
we do n't love how the states want to spend every dollar			0
but this is what a grand political bargain looks like , in case we 've forgotten			0
two weeks ago , we and our partners hand - delivered more than 133,000 petitions to the @entity130 , calling for full and complete accountability under the law for @entity1 and its partners			0
the point of the petitions was pretty straightforward : these rules matter to @entity12 , and everyone needs to play and -- in this case -- pay fully			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity185 .			0

@entity185 : @entity1 is rightly on trial , potentially facing judgment in tens of billions
he says even if @entity1 settles , it will send signal that @entity12 enforces clean air , water rules
he says pollution of @entity6 spill still present three years later ; @entity1 must be accountable
@entity198 : *big* judgment will fund @entity6 restoration and send message
