@entity0 -- as emerging markets slump and the euro zone continues to struggle , the @entity3 economy made a surprising surge in the first part of this year			1
the slowdowns in @entity10 countries , @entity11 in particular , are feared to drag down the global economy			0
but in the first quarter of 2012 , the @entity3 economy grew 6.4 % , the fastest since 2010 and already far outpacing the @entity15 's forecast growth of 3.5 % for this year			1
the growth surge was driven in part by a recovery of electronics exports after a decline in demand last year , while analysts say the economy was buoyed by strong domestic consumption			1
it is the money sent home to the @entity3 by its overseas workers , known as remittances , and the rise of outsourced call centers that serve as the long - term stabilizers relatively unhindered by a sagging global economy , according to analysts			1
" about 70 % of our economy is from consumption , so remittance is the key fuel behind that , " said @entity33 , @entity34 - based head of research for the @entity3 at @entity36			1
" it drives consumption in malls			0
even on the property side , the government estimates a third of remittances go into home purchases and rentals of properties			2
" it is estimated that 11 % of the population of 92 million work overseas			0
remittances account for about 10 % of the country 's gdp , which totaled $ 225 billion in 2011			1
because @entity3 head to a wide variety of countries to work , the diversity protects them from the full impact of regional economic troubles			2
the @entity64 has the largest portion of the @entity3 ' overseas labor force , with 61 % working there			1
@entity68 is the next highest , with 27 % , followed by the 6 % in @entity69			0
moreover , these migrants often work as domestic workers , nurses or skilled technicians , types of jobs that are believed to be less vulnerable during an economic slowdown			0
" you have an aging population in the @entity79 , and you have a young population here in the @entity3 that is waiting to do jobs that some people in the @entity79 are n't willing to do , " @entity33 said			2
another sector that has helped drive consumption is the call center industry , which has overtaken @entity88 's as the largest over the past decade			2
these jobs are considered well - paid -- enough for workers to afford , after several years ' employment , down payments on condominiums in @entity34 's booming property market , @entity33 said			0
these jobs could leave the country structurally well positioned going into a slowdown ; as wealthier economies seek to cut costs , they tend to increase outsourcing to low - cost , @entity102 - speaking markets like the @entity3			2
@entity105 - based @entity104 , the senior economist for @entity106 at @entity107 , said the @entity3 has experienced " a virtuous circle of improved stability " with more investments , lower inflation , currency valuations going up and interest rates coming down			1
other factors that have aided in the country 's growth early this year are the transfer of operations to the @entity3 from @entity119 by flood - disrupted businesses , said @entity104 , as well as improved electronics exports			1
while most analysts are optimistic , they do not expect growth for the year to be maintained at the first quarter 's level -- @entity127 's compiled predictions for gdp growth in 2012 averages at 4.2 %			1
@entity130 's upgraded the country 's debt rating last wednesday to @entity133 + , one notch below investment grade			0
last friday , the @entity3 @entity136 hit an all - time high			2
the peso was the best performer among the 11 major @entity68 currencies , according to @entity127 , up 5 % against the dollar this year			0
cuts in interest rates and the government 's plans to spend more aggressively have boosted investor confidence in the @entity3 , which has a third of its population living below the poverty line of $ 1.25 per day			1
economists also credit president @entity150 for his efforts to push back corruption and undertake infrastructure projects			0
" you can see evidence of construction activity in @entity34 , " @entity104 said			0
