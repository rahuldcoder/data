-- the good news for @entity2 at the @entity3 was that his second round was better than the first			1
but @entity2 still has a long way to go if he is to win his first golf tournament of 2014			2
while @entity2 struggled to find his best form , @entity8 had another fine day and was the clubhouse leader late in the second round at 11 - under - par 129 , 11 shots better than @entity2			1
woods carded a 1 - over 71 on thursday in @entity14 and improved by two shots friday			1
he mixed three birdies with two bogeys , narrowly missing a birdie at the last on a shortish putt			0
he got himself out of trouble at the 12th to save par following a poor tee shot and then executed a sumptuous chip for a birdie at the 13th			0
the world no. 1 was expected to make the cut -- after missing a 54 - hole cut at the @entity28 in january			1
@entity29 , though , was n't			2
' @entity29 ' was at 1 - over after a 71 friday , undone by a double bogey at the 16th			1
" no , i wo n't make the cut , " @entity29 , ranked fifth , told reporters			1
" i had a tough time making birdies			0
my distance control was off			0
it just was n't sharp			0
" @entity38 , the hottest player on the circuit at the end of 2013 , surely wo n't be around on the weekend since he tallied a 9 - over through two rounds			1
the @entity43 's round included a double bogey and six bogeys			0
it was only last year that @entity8 walked off the course in the second round , blaming a toothache			2
he later apologized but the episode was all part of a poor 2013			0
this week in @entity52 , @entity8 is looking more like the golfer who won the event in 2012 on his way to the no. 1 ranking			1
" it 's a different end of the spectrum i guess , " @entity8 told the @entity58 's website			2
" i was n't quite comfortable with my golf swing			0
i was still tinkering with equipment			0
i just was n't feeling in control of what i needed to be in control of			0
" this year is obviously a lot different			0
" @entity8 could n't match his sizzling 63 on thursday but he still was n't shabby			2
after hitting bogeys in two of his first three holes , @entity8 did n't drop another shot and struck six birdies for a 66			1
the tough course was clearly taking its toll , as @entity8 was the lone member of the top eight in the world rankings to be inside the top 20 at the @entity3 nearing the end of play friday .			1
