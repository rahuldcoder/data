-- at @entity3 , the name of @entity2 resounds everywhere in homes , churches , in hauntingly gorgeous carols , even casual conversations			1
yet @entity8 did n't settle on december 25 as @entity3 day until the fourth century , and this choice probably had something to do with its proximity to the winter solstice or its position as the final day of the @entity14			1
it was in the late third century , in fact , that the roman emperor @entity17 established this date as a feast day celebrating the birth of the @entity21 ( @entity21 ) , so it already had festive and quasi-religious prominence			2
now it serves to welcome the infant who became @entity25 , the @entity27 word for @entity28			2
there are probably as many visions of @entity2 , and versions , as there are @entity8			1
many regard him as their savior , the @entity33 sent to @entity36 to save human beings from themselves			2
others see him as a great teacher , a healer or rabbi of extraordinary power , a holy man or prophet who proposed a new covenant between heaven and earth			2
to some , he represents a new world order , an egalitarian society , a preacher of nonviolence who asked us to turn the other cheek			2
was he the long - awaited @entity53 ? the @entity54 who removes the sin of the world by his self - sacrifice ? @entity59 ? or something less dramatic but still impressive -- an ethical teacher of extraordinary grace and power ? my father , a former @entity66 , became a @entity68 minister , and i grew up with an insider 's view of evangelical @entity71			1
my father read the @entity74 aloud at breakfast each morning , always in the @entity76			0
beginning in december , i listened to the sonorous birth narratives of @entity78 and @entity79			0
in the latter , there are @entity82 coming from the @entity83 , a mysterious star , the massacre of innocent children by @entity87 , and a flight to @entity89 by the @entity90			0
belief blog : the @entity3 message of the real @entity93 my father , like me , preferred the gentler @entity3 story put forward by @entity78 : " and there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field , keeping watch over their flock by night			1
and , lo , the angel of the @entity104 came upon them , and the glory of the @entity104 shone round about them : and they were sore afraid			0
and the angel said unto them , fear not : for , behold , i bring you good tidings of great joy , which shall be to all people			0
" i remember asking my father one day why these two @entity3 stories seemed incompatible , at best			1
even the lineages put forward by @entity79 and @entity78 have few points of reconciliation			0
i also wondered why the two other gospels -- @entity120 and @entity121 -- made no mention of @entity3			1
why was there no mention of @entity3 anywhere else in the whole of the @entity74 ? did n't they care ? he was a gentle but cautious fellow , my father , with a rock - solid faith			1
" it 's probably better not to ask difficult questions , " he said			2
" @entity132 will , in time , provide the answers			0
" he told me simply to enjoy @entity3			1
that did n't satisfy me , of course			0
why should it ? i realized that , as @entity139 so elegantly put it , we see only " through a glass darkly " while on this earth			0
but was n't that too easy ? i needed to know more			0
and i still want to know the truth about this luminous figure , @entity2			1
was he really the @entity33 ? why was he sent into the world ? do we know anything about him , really ? to consider yourself a @entity8 , must you believe in the @entity151 , or that @entity2 walked on water , healed the sick , and rose triumphantly from the dead ? does it matter if we take all of this on board in a literal fashion ? is n't this a lovely mythos -- the @entity27 word for story -- a narrative with symbolic resonance and profound meaning ? @entity3 by the numbers @entity2 himself seemed unwilling to answer questions about his royal status or divinity			1
when asked by @entity169 about his status as @entity59 , he simply replied , " you say so			0
" many in his circle referred to as the @entity33 , but this was n't an especially divine title			0
@entity176 was called @entity33 -- @entity177 -- on roman coins			0
@entity2 certainly regarded himself as having a filial connection to the person he called , in his native @entity181 , @entity182 , or @entity183			1
but does n't that only mean he felt like a son before this personified spirit ? he was also called the @entity186 , reaching back to an ancient @entity188 phrase , which had rather humbling connotations			0
( it was in the @entity191 that a visionary figure called the @entity186 came into view , in apocalyptic terms )			0
all attempts to classify @entity2 seem hopelessly inadequate			1
as i 've grown older , i appreciate more than ever before the strength of this figure , @entity2 , who emerges in the four canonical @entity200 , and the @entity202 gospels , as a witty , intelligent , complex , inspiring , and often contradictory person			1
he was a religious genius who grew up on the @entity206 in ancient @entity207 , on that magical trade route connecting @entity83 and @entity209			0
from the @entity209 he acquired an understanding of @entity27 metaphysics , with its remarkable formulation of body and soul			0
from the @entity83 came the winds of mysticism , a sense of self - transformation based on the loss of selfhood , with enlightenment the ultimate goal			0
@entity2 brings @entity83 and @entity209 together , focusing on his key idea -- that of a gradually realizing kingdom , a mystical space beyond time , though it requires time in order to root and grow			1
as he told someone who asked where this lofty kingdom lay : " the kingdom of @entity132 is within you			0
" photos : santas over the years too many @entity8 regard their religion as a list of boxes that need checking			1
to belong , you must subscribe to a particular set of beliefs			0
it 's dogma , pure and simple			2
i suspect that @entity2 himself would have been startled to think that , many centuries after his death , more than 2 billion people would celebrate his coming into the world , find his message of a gradually realizing kingdom an inspiring challenge , worthy of serious pursuit , devotion and emulation			1
@entity2 was a real person who lived in time , and his life has huge mythical resonance with the power to change hearts and minds			1
at this stage of my life -- a senior citizen , as they say politely -- i 'm also quite happy to believe in miracles , assuming that the membrane between life and death is paper thin			2
all @entity8 thinking is , however , about resurrection			1
it 's about moving beyond our small selves , shifting away from our ego - drenched understanding of reality			2
the way of @entity2 involves engagement with his ( often difficult ) teachings as well as looking for those unspeakably beautiful moments in time when , for just a few seconds perhaps , we apprehend the timeless moment in time			1
life mostly offers , as @entity283 suggests in " @entity284 , " " only hints and guesses , / hints followed by guesses			2
" the rest is " prayer , observance , discipline , thought and action			0
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity296 .			2

@entity296 : there are as many visions of @entity2 , and versions , as there are @entity8
@entity296 : as a child , i wondered why only two of the gospels mention @entity3
he says he believes firmly that @entity2 was a real person , complex and inspiring
@entity296 : @entity2 's life has mythical resonance with the power to change hearts and minds
