-- @entity2 golfer @entity1 made a furious charge sunday to win the @entity4 , grabbing his fist major tournament victory			1
@entity6 had started the day four shots back off the lead but carded four birdies in five holes midway through the final round to get to the top of the leaderboard			0
it gave the @entity2 a third successive major win following @entity17 's maiden triumph at the masters in april and @entity19 at last year 's @entity20			2
@entity6 shot two - under - par 68 sunday to end the tournament at one - over 281 for the four rounds			0
that score was good enough to win as all the golfers struggled on the slick greens of @entity27 's @entity26 and no one scored under par. " it was a cool day			0
i had peace all day , " said the 26 - year - old @entity1 , who has won two other @entity32 events			1
" i prayed more the last three holes than i did all my life			0
" i had no experience in major championships of contention at all , so for me to play sunday fourth from the last group was probably an huge help , as opposed to the last group			2
i have gained utmost respect for all the guys who have won multiple majors , because it is just so hard to do			0
the level of pressure is so much greater than a regular event			0

@entity53 stumbled early in the final round but @entity52 held the lead for most of day			1
@entity52 , who had held the lead from friday afternoon , was unable to withstand @entity6 's great play			2
but still on the last hole , both @entity53 and @entity52 were just one shot behind @entity6			1
both had to get birdies to catch @entity6 and tie the tournament , setting up a dramatic ending			0
@entity52 , the 2003 winner , buried his second shot in a bunker dashing his chances			1
@entity53 -- who claimed his first major at @entity68 in 2010 -- played better but still missed a 24 - foot birdie putt , to end his hopes			2
@entity71 continued his fall sunday as he failed in his bid for his fourth @entity4 title and his first major since winning at @entity76 in 2008			1
woods was tied with @entity52 and @entity78 for the halfway lead going into play saturday at one under par. but his play faded and on sunday the 14 - time major champion ended the tournament in a tie for 21st place , dropping four shots in the first three holes of his final round as he eventually signed for a 73			1
" i was just a touch off , " said @entity71 , who was six shots behind @entity6			2
" today , i got off to a horrific start and just never got it going			0
