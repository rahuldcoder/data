-- the world 's poorest countries could pay 40 percent more for food this year than they did last year because of rising prices , according to a @entity6 report released thursday			1
rising food prices have left many people , like this @entity10 boy , unable to afford food and malnourished			1
in those countries , nearly a billion people are on the brink of malnourishment and , as food prices climb , more at risk of starving			1
the latest @entity19 report , compiled by the @entity6 's @entity20 , shows that countries which spend a substantial part of their budgets on food will pay $ 169 billion this year for food imports			1
that is 40 percent higher than last year and four times higher than in 2000			2
" food is no longer the cheap commodity that it once was , " @entity20 assistant director - general @entity27 said			2
" rising food prices are bound to worsen the already unacceptable level of food deprivation suffered by 854 million people			1
" we are facing the risk that the number of hungry will increase by many more millions of people			0
" the @entity20 lists 82 countries as " @entity39 " that can not produce or import enough food to meet their all their population 's needs			2
more than half of the countries are in @entity46			2
riots from @entity48 to @entity49 to @entity50 this year over surging food prices brought the issue to a boiling point			1
the @entity6 ' @entity54 and @entity56 president @entity55 recently appealed to the international community to donate $ 500 milllion to help meet emergency needs by those hit by the high food and fuel prices			1
last month , @entity63 president @entity62 ordered the release of $ 200 million in emergency aid			0
the money , to be drawn from a food reserve , will address food needs in @entity46 and elsewhere , the @entity66 said			0
the @entity63 is the world 's largest provider of food aid , delivering more than $ 2.1 billion in food aid to 78 countries last year , the @entity66 said in a statement			1
" this is the world 's big story , " said @entity76 , director of @entity78 's @entity77			0
" there are riots all over the world in the poor countries			1
... our own poor are feeling it in the @entity63			0
" @entity55 has said the rising costs could mean " seven lost years " in the fight against worldwide poverty			1
" while many are worrying about filling their gas tanks , many others around the world are struggling to fill their stomachs , and it is getting more and more difficult every day , " @entity55 said last month in a speech opening meetings with the world 's finance ministers			1
" in just two months , " @entity55 said , " rice prices have skyrocketed to near historical levels , rising by around 75 percent globally and more in some markets , with more likely to come			0
in @entity49 , a 2 - kilogram bag of rice ... now consumes about half of the daily income of a poor family			2
" the price of wheat has jumped 120 percent in the past year , he said , meaning that the price of a loaf of bread has more than doubled in places where the poor spend as much as 75 percent of their income on food			1
" this is not just about meals forgone today or about increasing social unrest			0
this is about lost learning potential for children and adults in the future , stunted intellectual and physical growth , " @entity55 said			0
in the @entity63 and other @entity129 nations , more and more poor families are feeling the pinch			0
in recent days , presidential candidates have paid increasing attention to the cost of food , often citing it on the stump			0
the issue is also fueling a rising debate over how much the rising prices can be blamed on ethanol production			0
the basic argument is that because ethanol comes from corn , the push to replace some traditional fuels with ethanol has created a new demand for corn that has thrown off world food prices			1
@entity149 , @entity6 special rapporteur on the right to food , has called using food crops to create ethanol " a crime against humanity			0
" @entity76 said , " we 've been putting our food into the gas tank ; this corn - to - ethanol subsidy which our government is doing really makes little sense			2
" the ethanol industry rejects the focus on ethanol in examining food prices			1
" the contrived food vs. fuel debate has reared its ugly head once again , " the @entity167 , which lobbies @entity168 on the behalf of the industry , said on its web site , adding that " numerous statistical analyses have demonstrated that the price of oil -- not corn prices or ethanol production -- has the greatest impact on consumer food prices because it is integral to virtually every phase of food production , from processing to packaging to transportation			1
" analysts agree that the cost of fuel is among the reasons for the skyrocketing prices			0
another major reason is rising demand , particularly in places in the midst of a population boom , such as @entity196 and @entity197			0
also , @entity76 said , " climate shocks " are damaging food supply in parts of the world			0
" you add it all together : demand is soaring ; supply has been cut back ; food has been diverted into the gas tank			2
it 's added up to a price explosion			0
