-- @entity1 today is a free @entity1 , but also a @entity1 plagued by a sad and violent history , a @entity1 that has not been able to progress for 42 years			1
basic education , health care and infrastructure are integral to @entity1 's success and its future			1
but art and culture can be and should be a huge part of the healing process as well as future development			1
by integrating art and culture into the core efforts at transition from @entity18 's ruinous rule , we can transcend part of the trauma of war and violence and create a distinct national identity , free of speculation as to old tribal or political allegiances and accepting of the whole of @entity1 society			1
the ruins of @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 ( also called @entity32 ) and all the other incredible remnants of @entity1 's rich history can be an example of the glory of @entity1 's past -- but also its hope for the future			1
@entity1 's possibilities are often measured by way of its abundant natural resources , but the revolution this past year has put in perspective @entity1 's truest and greatest assets : the courageous @entity1 people , their rich multifaceted culture , and the ideals with which they wish to make their place in this world , challenging power that at times has seemed absolute			1
this was what my father and family tried to articulate to me as a child , growing up in exile			0
@entity1 culture has a long and storied history , dating back to ancient times , influenced by a variety of traditions and peoples who have made their way across the deserts of @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity70			1
the majestic ruins that run along the coastline are testament to this history			0
as i arrived to these sites , seeing the monuments of the @entity76 and ancient @entity78 civilizations beside the @entity79 , i was struck by the ageless beauty of @entity30 , @entity29 and @entity31			2
but as an art world professional , i was also struck by the lack of preservation surrounding the ruins			0
@entity85 is a nonprofit organization that works to preserve cultural sites around the world			0
@entity85 projects in @entity31 and @entity89 have stalled as a result of the revolution , but the group has renewed its efforts with the new @entity1			2
@entity85 has done its utmost to involve @entity1			2
students from the universities of @entity97 and @entity98 were and will be involved in the conservation efforts in the framework of their archaeology management studies			0
i 've recently been appointed to help @entity85 set up its @entity102			0
we hope that as @entity1 prospers and grows , the government will recognize the importance of these sites , as a possible boon to the tourism industry but also as a source of economic diversification and patriotic reconciliation			2
i began working in the art world in 2005 after completing my education at @entity114 and the @entity115 , and my first full - time job was really because of @entity1			1
i worked as a project coordinator for renowned artists @entity119 and @entity121 's @entity120 , a nonprofit project that brings international artists to @entity124 , @entity125 , to interact with the local population and produce ephemeral work that is more about creating an experience than an object			0
@entity124 is a mystical desert oasis , possibly home to @entity133 's lost army and @entity135 's healing waters			2
its proximity to the @entity1 border was a huge draw to me			2
as my family was not allowed to go back to @entity1 , the closest i had been to @entity1 at that point was @entity141 , so being able to see the rolling dunes crisscrossing the border was an opportunity i could n't pass up			0
in the end , it was a serendipitous event for me , as i fell in love with the art world and i have since devoted my time , both personal and professional , to helping the development and evolution of arts in the @entity153			0
i hope that @entity1 's development will usher in new forms of expression , and i look forward to seeing how that newfound expression will find its place in the visual arts			1
i anticipate celebrating contemporary art alongside the ancient monuments and illustrating that @entity1 can show its maturity , but also its innovation and creativity			1
although suffering from a severe deficit of social and physical infrastructure , @entity1 today is free from tyrannical rule			0
its people have the opportunity to design a fit - for - purpose political system , which takes into account @entity1 's diverse peoples , tribes and cultures , creating a unique national identity			1
all @entity1 can be proud of @entity29			0
all @entity1 can be proud of their cultural heritage			1
and through concerted efforts to integrate arts education in to schools and everyday life and preserve these historical sites , this can indeed be a reality			0
