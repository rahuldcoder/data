@entity9 " oh please , mind your language , show some restraint : it was not a @entity3 september 11 ! " wrote @entity0 last week , in an otherwise nuanced article on the @entity3 @entity2 and the emergence of extremists			1
this brilliant intellectual , a researcher on @entity12 , meant there was no comparison between the 17 victims of @entity16 and the nearly 3,000 dead in the @entity17 14 years ago			1
the size and intensity of the crime and trauma , the level of destruction , defies the comparison			2
but so do the consequences			2
@entity3 president @entity27 may have enjoyed a miraculous boost in the polls , he may pace on the deck of an aircraft carrier with a strange @entity33 - like swagger amid the chorus of sacred national union , but he wo n't bend the course of world history because of an attack on his territory			1
still , he looks at @entity3 now and finds matters of tremendous reflections , along with some similarities			1
coping with anger is one of them			2
in the 10 days after september 11 , three innocent men were killed in @entity46 , @entity47 and @entity48 , just because they looked @entity2 in the eyes of the shooters			1
one was a @entity52 store owner who was targeted because he wore a turban			0
@entity3 has had no murders but saw more @entity56 attacks -- ranging from insults to depredation of mosques -- in the rest of the country from january 7 - 20 than in all of @entity3 in 2014			1
then there 's the institutional furor			0
i remember vividly in 2001 the cases of @entity2 foreigners deported for spurious reasons , such as mere accusations of having made anti-american statements , not even related to terrorism , in reported private conversations			1
some were jailed in secret on the most outlandish suspicions			0
a @entity76 man with heart disease , locked up under the pretext of his overstaying a visitor 's visa , died alone in a @entity82 cell of a heart attack			0
others were forgotten behind bars for months			0
the @entity86 @entity3 may have criticized @entity17 's hysteria at the time , but they have little to brag about lately			1
a week after the @entity91 attack more than 50 individuals had already been charged -- and 10 of them sentenced to prison terms -- for the crime of incitation to terrorism			0
one of them is a man arrested for driving under the influence who got a 14 - month sentence , due in part to his previous arrests , after mentioning the fate of the three police officers killed			2
another is a man with psychiatric problems who received three months for his rants , even though the prosecution itself recognized his place was less in prison than in a treatment facility			0
@entity3 comic @entity115 , accused of @entity116 , which he denies , but convicted nine times for inciting racial hatred and similar charges , will be judged by an anti-terror court for his apparent condoning on @entity122 of @entity123 , the killer at the kosher store in east @entity16			1
@entity115 is a pathetic merchant of hate -- not a terrorist			0
neither seem to be six other people sent to prison , one of them for two years , for their ugly posts on social network , in accordance with the same law originally aimed at jihadist propagandists on the @entity135			0
after september 11 , @entity17 resented " having been too kind " in the prevention of terrorism , and many commentators urge @entity16 not to fall into the trap of its own patriot act			1
but the @entity3 have long had a set of anti-terror laws that have been the envy of @entity17 's police and intelligence departments			1
attacks by opposition politicians stating that the legal hurdles of @entity3 's " soft on crime " and " socialist " government -- which they claim prevented phone taps of the terrorists -- are a joke			1
our police let the terrorists off the hook this summer for a number of reasons			0
firstly , they had nothing on them but petty violations of counterfeit laws			0
secondly , they had plenty of other fish to fry -- namely 5,000 other potential @entity3 jihadists whose tracking would demand a minimum of 10 detectives per suspect			1
there 's also the fact that more than 900 people have left @entity3 to join the ranks of @entity178 in @entity179 and @entity180 -- a mindboggling number			1
@entity17 discovered in 2001 the extent of the hate brewing in the @entity2 world through the acts of 19 killers -- some of whom had spent more than a year in their country			1
@entity3 has to look inward , which may be even more painful , and scrutinize the three " children of the republic " born and raised in its civilization			1
one of the first moves by the government was to grant citizenship in a week after the supermarket attack to the young @entity2 employee , an immigrant from @entity199 , who had hidden captives during the siege at the kosher store			2
the second was for prime minister @entity204 , who emigrated from @entity205 as a child , to decry the " apartheid " @entity3 's @entity2 population suffers			1
the word may be shocking , but it conveys , officially for once , the long known reality of our ghettos , the failure of integration in @entity3 and the incapacity of our school system			2
racism ? @entity3 had and still has its share of bigots , theoreticians and enforcers of the worst discriminations			2
but this shows more simply what @entity17 liberals would call " a lack of sensitivity " -- an incapacity , being such a diverse society , to accept that the cultural rules of the white male majority may not be entirely palatable , or accessible , by other members of the population			0
@entity234 , denied in the name of the rejection of @entity17 - style political correctness , is an example			2
race and culture barriers are another manifestation of this orchestrated blindness			0
at a moment when ghettos promote the surge of religious devotion as a remedy to the denial of " @entity250 , " the gap is getting even wider , and the rage more dangerous in the eyes of the most violent of the downtrodden and hopeless			0
the so - called " @entity255 , " the official secularism of the @entity3 , bears a deep responsibility			1
the concept has always been a political expedient , an offshoot of anti-clericalism that justified even in part the denial of the right to vote for women until 1945 , out of fear their obedience to the @entity268 would endanger the @entity269			0
it has later , for too long , been directed at the most different and disadvantaged immigrant population from the @entity273 region			0
a glorious façade of the denial of differences , one which let discriminations and injustice fester for decades , prevented any affirmative action or simple recognition of diversity			0
long before september 11 , @entity284 , speaking of race and class relations , said that " there is nothing bad in @entity17 that can not be solved with what is good in @entity17			0
" the same must be true in @entity3 as the horror of january makes us look at the truth about our country .			2

@entity3 has had no murders but has seen more @entity56 violence since @entity16 attacks
@entity297 : @entity3 must avoid *lashing* out at @entity2 through the courts out of anger
@entity3 must now inward and examine *alienation* that @entity2 feel - @entity297
