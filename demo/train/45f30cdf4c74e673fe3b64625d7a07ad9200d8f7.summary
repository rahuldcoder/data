@entity0 -- thousands of @entity2 learn a painful lesson in banking every day : waiting for a check to clear and then getting access to the money from a bank does n't mean the check has really cleared			1
when @entity11 , of @entity12 , responded to an ad on @entity14 for an office assistant , a woman e-mailed him and said her @entity17 company was starting to sell its product in the @entity2 , but was having trouble with dealing with checks from customers			1
@entity11 said the woman needed someone to collect the checks and then send the money to her company			1
it was a commission job -- deposit the checks , wait for the funds to become available at his bank , then send cash to her , minus 10 percent for @entity11			0
after @entity11 checked out what seemed like a legitimate company on the @entity37 , he started receiving checks totaling several thousand dollars and deposited them in his account			0
when his bank released the funds , he sent cash to an address outside the country			0
but after a few weeks , @entity11 's bank notified him the checks he had deposited had actually been returned , and that he owed the bank all the money he had withdrawn			2
@entity11 has not heard from his business partner since and does n't even know who she really is			0
he still owes his bank money , is unemployed and does n't know what action the bank might take against him			0
what happened to @entity11 is one example of a wide range of fake check scams carried out in the @entity2 every year			1
a @entity60 survey estimates that 1.3 million @entity2 have been the victim of a fake check scam , with an average loss of $ 3,000 to $ 4,000 per consumer			1
the most common scams are fake sweepstakes or lotteries , phony government sponsored grants and fraudulent work - at - home opportunities , the survey says			1
the scams follow the pattern of the so - called @entity74 internet scams , which often involve accepting transfers of money that become obviously phony when it 's too late			2
on wednesday , the @entity60 launched a campaign to combat check scams			1
many consumers do n't know they are responsible if they deposit a bad check , said @entity82 , the federation 's director of consumer protection			2
@entity85 said its survey shows an alarming level of misinformation among consumers , and the problem includes money orders and cashier 's checks			1
fifty - nine percent of respondents in the survey incorrectly thought that , when you deposit a check or money order , your bank confirms it is good before allowing you to withdraw the money			1
that number goes up to 70 percent among adults age 18 to 24			0
more than 40 percent of those surveyed also incorrectly think that the person who gave you the bad check must pay back the bank			0
@entity2 consumers are mostly unfamiliar with the time needed to process checks and money orders , say consumer watchdogs			1
government banking rules mandate that money from deposits become available within one to five days			0
however , it can take weeks , especially with foreign checks or money orders , for the originating institutions to get the checks or money orders back and determine that they are counterfeit			2
when that happens , scam victims are in for a rude surprise			0
@entity124 , which runs legitimate sweepstakes , warns consumers that scammers might claim that you are being given an advance on a prize , but that some fee , tax or other payment needs to be sent before you get the jackpot			0
that 's the heart of the scam , and it 's something that a real sweepstakes will never ask for , say legitimate companies			0
consumer protection groups , state attorney generals , the @entity142 and government bank regulators warn consumers that the number of fake checks , money orders and even cashier 's checks being used to scam victims is increasing			1
the bottom line : " there 's no legitimate reason why anyone who wants to give you a check or money order for something would ever ask you to send money anywhere in return			1
it 's as simple as that , " said @entity85 of the @entity60			0
@entity11 said he suspected that his part - time job was not on the up - and - up , but did n't know about fake check scams			1
he 's not sure how he will pay back his bank , but hopes his story will help keep other people from becoming victims			0
the @entity60 's tips against fake check scams : -- never agree to pay to claim a prize			1
-- never agree to pay for grants from the government or foundations			0
-- never agree to cash checks and send the money somewhere as part of a job working from home			2
-- never agree to wire money to anyone you have not met in person and known for a long time			2
-- if it seems suspicious , consult your state or local consumer protection agency , the @entity142 , the @entity187 or another trusted source			0
-- remember that there is no legitimate reason why anyone who wants to give you a check or money order would ask you to send money anywhere in return .			2
