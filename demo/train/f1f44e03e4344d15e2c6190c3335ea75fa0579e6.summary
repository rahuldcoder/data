-- the long - term strategy behind @entity3 's military repositioning in @entity4 is gradually revealing itself			1
a series of moves over the past six months will set the stage for rebalancing @entity3 naval , air and ground forces in the region			2
in november , the @entity3 announced a permanent rotation of @entity13 through @entity14 , the stationing of up to four ships in @entity17 , and expanded military exercises with the @entity19			1
the @entity20 also pledged that it would protect its @entity22 military forces from upcoming defense budget cuts			0
prime minister @entity25 's visit to @entity26 this week came after an announcement about @entity3 forces in @entity29			0
some 9,000 @entity13 will be transferred from @entity30 , the prefecture that hosts the majority of @entity3 forces in @entity29 , to three other sites : @entity34 , @entity35 , and -- on rotating training deployments -- @entity14			1
the deal broke the gridlock that had been holding up a reduction of @entity3 troops in @entity30			1
a mutual decision not to resolve the thorny issue of a replacement facility for @entity13 aviation stationed at @entity45 eased the way , as did the @entity29 agreement to pay more than a third of the $ 8.6 billion cost of the move			0
@entity30 is part of the long @entity53 island chain that acts as a natural barrier between the @entity55 and the @entity56			0
@entity3 forces have been stationed there since the @entity58 , the largest @entity22 amphibious assault in @entity59 the @entity3 retained possession of @entity30 until 1972 , by which time @entity3 forces had ensconced themselves in a series of military installations			1
in 1995 , the rape of a 12 - year - old @entity29 girl by three @entity3 servicemen sparked a furor over the vast military presence in @entity30			1
the inability to make good on a 15 - year - old agreement to reduce the @entity3 presence and hand back more than 20 % of the land occupied by troops and to substantially reduce @entity3 forces has been an open wound in an otherwise robust alliance with @entity29			1
the new deal should soothe but not solve local tensions			2
@entity3 forces demonstrated their value in responding to last year 's massive earthquake and tsunami , and they remain ready to deal with a range of potential near - term threats			0
but the transfer of @entity13 from @entity30 is the latest element giving definition to a long - term strategy to preserve regional order and @entity3 influence throughout @entity4			1
these gradual changes are happening amid a variety of key debates : within the @entity3 , about the necessity and affordability of a strong presence in @entity4 ; within @entity95 about whether @entity3 's " return to @entity4 " is aimed at containing growing @entity95 power ; and within the region over the durability of @entity3 's commitment to underwriting order in the @entity22			1
there are good reasons for retaining but dispersing @entity3 military forces throughout the region			1
first , the @entity22 is of growing global importance economically and politically , a long - term trend that has made it a rising priority for @entity3 administrations since the end of the @entity110			1
there is indeed a desire to preserve a favorable balance of military power so as to deter and accommodate a re-emerging @entity95 ; yet the retention of @entity3 forces in the region is not designed to curb @entity95 growth			2
@entity3 and @entity29 leaders label this as dealing with " uncertainty			0
" it hedges against a variety of contingencies , from conflict with @entity124 to natural disasters , while also reassuring allies , engaging a larger number of regional partners , and allowing the @entity3 to be a force for stability within an evolving regional order			0
second , these changes emerge from a longstanding need for better management of the @entity3 - @entity29 alliance			0
to reduce the political if not the financial costs of stationing forces in @entity29 , the @entity3 must lighten the burden on local populations , especially in @entity30			1
a closer integration of @entity3 and @entity29 forces is likewise under way			0
@entity95 portrays the @entity3 - @entity29 alliance as a @entity110 relic incompatible with expanding cooperation with @entity95 ; but most regional neighbors see it as a reassuring bellwether of stability			0
third , the @entity3 rebalancing redistributes forces from a few , fixed bases that are increasingly vulnerable to such emerging potential threats as @entity95 's missile , cyber and space capabilities , and maritime and air forces			0
retaining the @entity158 headquarters and some forces in @entity30 , the @entity3 is shifting two @entity160 ( each comprising about 2,500 troops ) to an emerging strategic hub in @entity34 , rotating another through @entity163 , @entity14 , and basing supporting elements in @entity35			1
these forces are more resilient because they are more difficult to target , yet well poised to maneuver together in the event of a crisis			0
in short , the shifting of @entity3 forces in the @entity22 is designed to deter conflict , respond to contingencies , reassure allies and partners , and shape an evolving regional order , including cooperation on humanitarian assistance and disaster response			2
@entity29 , once called an " unsinkable aircraft carrier , " remains critical to @entity3 basing strategy in the @entity22			2
some 30,000 @entity3 forces will remain based in @entity29 , about the same number as in @entity124			0
the number is higher if you count @entity3 forces afloat			0
but as prosperous @entity29 and @entity183 assume more responsibilities for their defense , the @entity3 has a strategic , fiscal , and operational need to redistribute its assets			0
the growing importance of islands , from @entity34 and the @entity190 to @entity35 and other islands that will be used for prepositioning and training , helps build flexibility in the @entity3 @entity22 strategy			1
various @entity197 administration officials place an emphasis on @entity3 as a " resident power " of the region rather than a foreign presence			2
but many in the region welcome @entity3 military presence precisely because it hails from a distant great power capable of underwriting peace in a region riven by historical conflicts , territorial disputes , resource competition , and disparate values			1
the emerging @entity3 basing strategy is designed to build on @entity3 's long - standing presence while ensuring that its stabilizing power remains welcome for decades to come			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity217 .			0

9,000 @entity13 will be *tranferred* from @entity30 to @entity34 , @entity35 and @entity14
this resolves a pact to reduce @entity3 troops in @entity30 , easing local tensions
@entity225 : the move also balances @entity3 military presence in the @entity22
@entity225 : @entity3 presence helps preserve order , influence in the fast - growing region
