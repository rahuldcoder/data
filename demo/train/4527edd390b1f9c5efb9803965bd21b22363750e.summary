@entity1 's career used to take her to far - flung places like @entity5 , @entity6 and @entity7 , where she would report on the latest news as part of her job as a tv journalist			1
these days however , the @entity15 winning reporter spends her time painting watercolors and crafting sculptures in her studio in the @entity19 of @entity20			1
after a fruitful career in journalism spanning decades , which saw the 54 - year - old anchor @entity24 and @entity26 's " @entity25 sunday " @entity1 decided to go back to her original love -- art. " i 've always been an artist , it 's always been a part of me , even as a journalist			1
it 's the way i see things visually , it 's the way i interpret information , " she says			2
@entity1 's art explores the human form , with her colorful clay sculptures examining the intricate musculature of both male and female shapes			1
she also produces charcoal drawings and oil paintings , and has created a public sculpture which for a time graced the corner of @entity20 's @entity47			2
@entity1 sees parallels between her former career and her art : " i still tell stories			1
but i tell stories with sculptures and i tell stories with paintings			0
" the difference is that a painting or a sculpture will last as long as the material lasts			0
a television story -- it 's a minute , a minute and a half , two and a half if you 're really lucky , and if you did n't see it when it aired , it 's gone , " she says			0
her early work was heavily influenced by the strife and suffering she saw traveling the world as a journalist , and served as an emotional outlet for her to overcome the negative news that surrounded her in her professional life			2
" you have to find a way to tell those stories and survive them emotionally , " she says , " but i do n't have those stories in front of me anymore			0
now i can do whatever , i do n't need to do the dark and often ugly as a way of staying okay , " she says			0
after a lifetime spent in the deadline - driven , fast - paced world of journalism , @entity1 says she relishes the time and space afforded to her by her art : " i like that feeling of not feeling rushed , of not feeling like i have to be in control of the process at all ... and i 'm just really along for the ride			1
i do n't feel any time constraints			0
i do n't feel anything pushing me to go from point a to @entity101 "			0
