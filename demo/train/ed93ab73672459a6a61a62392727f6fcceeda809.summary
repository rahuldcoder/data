, these changes ca n't come soon enough			0
@entity13 fixes : sunscreens will be labeled " water resistant " ( as opposed to waterproof or sweatproof ) ; they can no longer be called " sunblocks " ( as it overstates their effectiveness ) ; and they can no longer claim to provide instant sun protection or to last more than two hours without reapplication			1
on top of that , sunscreens can be labeled " broad spectrum " only if they protect equally against @entity26 ( the main culprit of skin cancer ) and @entity30 rays , which cause aging			1
unfortunately , the changes wo n't be on store shelves this summer			0
last week the @entity3 announced it is giving manufacturers six additional months from their original deadline to meet the new requirements			0
and even with these changes , most of us still have questions			0
here are the ones you sent to us , answered by our dermatologists			0
how much sunscreen do i really need to put on ? anytime you 're planning to be outdoors , go with an @entity46 of at least 30 ( 45 for a little extra insurance ) and put plenty on			1
the rule of thumb is 1 ounce ( the size of a shot glass ) on your body , and a teaspoon for your face , but derms advise being even more generous			0
reapply every two hours -- more often if you 're in and out of the water			1
@entity0 : 7 ways you 're aging your skin are there any sunscreens good for oily skin ? yes			1
what you want is an oil - free mineral block in an ultralight gel or liquid			1
" mineral sunscreens help mask redness , and because they reflect uv light , they help keep your skin surface cooler , " @entity66 notes			1
while you 're at it , keep your skin clean by always washing your face after working up a sweat outdoors : summer breakouts often have more to do with sweating than wearing sunscreen			1
how do i know if i 'm spraying on enough sunscreen ? i feel like it all blows away ! spray sunscreens are n't as powerful as lotions , so the trick is to look for one labeled " continuous spray " ( no need to pump ; it keeps spraying as long as your finger stays on the button ) and apply two coats -- not one -- every hour , @entity66 says			1
what should i look for in a sunscreen if i have sensitive skin ? all the dermatologists we interviewed recommend mineral - based or physical sunscreens made with micronized titanium dioxide and / or zinc oxide instead of chemical sunscreens because they 're less likely to irritate sensitive skin			1
plus , the latest mineral sunscreens give the gentle protection of a physical sunscreen without leaving a white cast			2
@entity0 : short - and - sweet skin advice is sunscreen really necessary for lips ? absolutely			1
in the past , it was n't unusual for lip products to come with little or no spf			0
thankfully , many companies have upped the level of protection in lip balms			0
that 's critical because skin cancers on the lower lip , in particular , are especially aggressive			2
" these cancers are dangerous , as they 're more likely to spread , " explains @entity115 , @entity116 , a @entity117 dermatologist			2
what 's the easiest way to stay protected when i 'm working out ? dab an @entity46 ( of at least 30 ) stick or gel on your face , neck , and chest , and on hot spots like shoulders and the backs of your hands			2
" the non-tacky sticks are great because they really stay put , " says @entity131 -- based dermatologist dr. @entity132			2
for the rest of your body , use a sunscreen spray			0
if you 're swimming or perspiring a lot , opt for one of the new formulas that are marked " water resistant " for up to 40 or 80 minutes			1
@entity0 : fun - in - the - sun workout i hate reapplying ! can i throw on a long - sleeved t - shirt instead at the beach ? " most cotton shirts are no substitute for sunscreen , " @entity66 says			2
" at best , they give you a @entity155 ( ultraviolet protection factor , the equivalent of @entity46 for clothing ) of 8 -- and if they get wet , that devolves to @entity160			2
" instead , invest in a long - sleeved rash guard -- a type of shirt made up of a spandex and nylon mix that was originally used for water sports , but is now popular as a sun protector			1
look for one with a @entity155 rating of 50 +			0
" those things are lifesavers -- total protection , even when wet , " @entity132 says			2
likewise , your sun hat should be floppy , wide - brimmed , and made from a tightly woven material			0
will my @entity46 foundation do the trick for workdays ? " you 'd have to slap on a heck of a lot to make it truly effective , " @entity115 says			0
a better idea : layer			0
wash your face , swipe on a few drops of antioxidant serum to boost your protection , and apply a tinted moisturizer or foundation with @entity46 15 or more			0
top it with an ultra fine @entity46 mineral powder			0
@entity115 recommends carrying the powder in your bag for touch - ups during the day -- especially if you 're lunching alfresco			1

labels will say " broad spectrum " only if they protect against *uvb* and @entity30 rays
if you have oily skin use an oil - free mineral block in an ultralight gel or liquid
reapply every two hours -- more often if you 're in and out of the water
