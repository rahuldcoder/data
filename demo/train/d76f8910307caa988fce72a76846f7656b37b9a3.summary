the issue received national attention after @entity0 highlighted literacy problems at @entity5			1

@entity8 said that more people knew about the fake classes , and that athletic support staff funneled athletes into the classes to keep eligible the players who could n't otherwise keep up with rigorous @entity5 classwork			1
after speaking to the local newspaper , the @entity48 in 2013 , she was demoted and given extra work , her lawsuit says			2
then , she says , university officials verbally attacked her in 2014 when @entity0 featured her in a story about the literacy rates of college athletes nationwide			2

he recently announced that he has acquired 1.5 million e-mails and documents , talked to 30 athletic support staff , and gotten valuable information from others			0

" @entity5 is the mother of all academic fraud violations , " @entity106 said			1
" i have no doubt that the scale of the @entity122 case constitutes the most significant academic fraud case in the @entity75			0
