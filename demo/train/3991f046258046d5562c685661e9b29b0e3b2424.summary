-- @entity2 prime minister @entity1 will arrive in @entity3 friday accompanied by a delegation of 10 business leaders -- a measure of how quickly the once reclusive @entity8 country is reengaging with the world both diplomatically and economically			1
the delegation will be presented as " tourists " to circumvent restrictions imposed by @entity14 trade sanctions , according to @entity2 's @entity16 newspaper			1
" it is not a trade mission			0
we are going to @entity3 for reasons of geography and the recent elections , which led to a positive outcome , " a source from the @entity2 government reportedly told the newspaper			1
" the government policy on @entity3 is to discourage trade			1
around ten members of the business delegation will come to @entity3			1
they will have a cultural program			0
they will be like tourists			0
" the move is controversial since @entity2 still publicly backs @entity14 sanctions which have held against the military - backed government since 1996			1
@entity1 's visit is the first by a major @entity42 leader since a 1962 coup began a half century of military rule			2
@entity45 to ease @entity3 sanctions , open relations @entity42 firms , meanwhile , are vying to be among the first to do business in @entity3 once sanctions are lifted			1
competitors from @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 and @entity56 are already well entrenched , tapping resources such as oil and natural gas , as well as sizeable deposits of coal , nickel ore and gemstones			0
@entity3 also stands to be a substantial exporter of lumber and rice			2
@entity1 is currently touring @entity8 -- including @entity67 and @entity68 -- with a delegation of 35 business leaders from companies such as @entity72 , @entity73 and the world 's biggest miner , @entity76			1
the @entity14 is due to meet on april 23 to discuss its common position on @entity3 , saying it was likely to send a " positive signal " when it reviews the measures later this month			2
both @entity82 and @entity83 are pushing for the complete lifting of sanctions , but other @entity14 members -- @entity2 included -- are likely to push for some sanctions to remain in place over @entity3 's political prisoners			1
human rights groups estimate that @entity3 holds 1,000 political prisoners including students , activists and monks			2
last week , the human rights advocacy group @entity95 called on the @entity14 to be cautious over sanctions , matching @entity3 reform for reform rather than simply lifting sanctions wholesale			1
while the @entity45 has welcomed changes in @entity3 -- this month announcing it would for the first time in 21 years nominate a candidate to serve as @entity45 ambassador to the country -- it also has urged caution as it seeks progress on more fronts including the resolution of ethnic violence			1
@entity112 's opposition @entity111 ( @entity111 ) won 43 out of 45 parliamentary seats , representing about 5 % of the total parliamentary seats , in elections on april 1			0
critics claim the election involved a relative handful of seats in a powerless parliament , amounting to little more than a token concession to the opposition and the international community , but @entity42 countries viewed the result as a powerful message from @entity3 that it was seeking reform			2
@entity128 , editor of the @entity129 and an associate professor in economics at @entity132 in @entity133 , told @entity0 that while @entity42 corporations were keen to do business in @entity3 , he warned against taking too cynical a view on the lifting of sanctions			1
" the desire for reform is quite genuine , " @entity128 said			0
he said the big question would be to what extent @entity112 's election would translate into real reform and to what extent she would be given a free hand to draft new laws			0
" the object of those that want sanctions lifted in the @entity45 was to try to bolster the reformers in @entity3 and , in their words , ' put a bit of wind in their sails , ' " @entity128 said			1
" the dilemma for the @entity45 is how to best support them , " he added			0
@entity128 said the issue of sanctions had gathered a new complexity in the light of the continuing conflict with the @entity164 ethnic minority in the far north of the country			2
@entity95 says fighting between the @entity3 military and the @entity168 , one of the largest and most powerful ethnic armies , has escalated over the past two years			2
the conflict has led to widespread refugee displacement in @entity3			0
" issues such as this are starting to divide people of goodwill , " @entity128 said			0
" there 's an issue over what 's moral and what is effective -- what do we hold our noses over and what do we stand firm on ? " @entity3 , also known as @entity3 , has been run by a military junta since 1962			0
sanctions were placed on the country following the violent suppression of popular protests in 1988			0
since then , @entity192 has placed overlapping sanctions on the country at various times , resulting in differing restrictions , waiver provisions , expiration conditions , and reporting requirements			0
@entity3 announced a series of reforms after elections in 2010 brought a civilian government with close ties to the military to power .			0
