@entity0 -- the @entity3 government asked the country 's high court friday for a delay in the scheduled demolition of an unauthorized @entity9 settlement outpost			1
many of the homes built by @entity13 settlers in a neighborhood of the @entity16 outpost are located on private @entity18 land			1
last year the @entity3 government told the court the homes would taken down by may 1			1
the right - wing government of @entity3 prime minister @entity22 asked the court for a three - month delay in carrying out the demolitions so a government committee can reassess the current policy of demolishing settler homes built on private @entity18 land			1
in the request the government argued , " the evacuation of the buildings could carry social , political and operational ramifications for construction in @entity16 and other settlements			0
" an official in @entity3 's @entity36 who was not authorized to speak publicly on the matter said the case of @entity16 differed from other illegal settler outposts because it was home to dozens of families that would lose their homes if the demolition went ahead			2
many of these houses have existed since the 1980s			0
illegal outposts are usually much smaller and not so well established			0
previous @entity3 governments have pledged to demolish the unauthorized settler outposts in the @entity9 , but only a handful have been removed			2
@entity51 , an attorney for @entity52 , an @entity3 nongovernmental organization that advocates for @entity18 rights , said the request was " an announcement of war by the @entity3 government against the rule of law			1
" " they said clearly that they have reached a decision not to evacuate illegal construction on private @entity18 property , " @entity51 said			2
" they ask for 90 days to change the policy			0
what kind of legal option is there when private property is taken other than restoring the possession of the property to its rightful owner ? " the request comes just days after the @entity3 government said it had decided to legalize the status of three other settlements that were built in the @entity9 during the 1990s			1
the move to authorize the settlements of @entity77 , @entity78 and @entity79 was based on " decisions by previous governments , " @entity22 's office said in a short statement issued earlier this week			0
the announcement was condemned by the @entity18 and brought public criticism from both the @entity85 and the @entity86			0
the issue of settlements and their continued growth is a key obstacle in the path of reviving the moribund peace process between @entity3 and @entity18 .			0

many homes of @entity3 settlers in a @entity9 outpost are on private @entity18 land
the @entity3 government said last year the homes would be demolished by may 1
government now requests a three - month delay in the demolition
critic calls the request " an announcement of war *...* against the rule of law "
