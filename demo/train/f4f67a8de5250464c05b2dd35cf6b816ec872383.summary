@entity0 -- for 106 years , cowboys and cattlemen have been coming from around the @entity4 to @entity0 for the annual @entity5			1
it 's part state fair , part rodeo and all @entity8			1
at night there is professional rodeo , but during the day hundreds of ranchers of all ages bring their best cows and bulls for judging			1
on the line is a blue ribbon and bragging rights			2
the sprawling backstage area in the bowels of the building echoes with the din of commercial - strength blow dryers as cow after cow is shuttled though the makeshift bovine beauty parlor before being led into the ring			1
upstairs the cowboys and cowgirls mosey around vendors hawking boots , buckles and hats			0
they mingle with the fleece - clad @entity33 and chat amongst themselves about grain prices , drought and yes , @entity37 and the @entity38			0
the show kicked off last weekend and runs through january 22			0
soon enough these cattle herders will be back on their ranches as winter bears down on the @entity4			0
but for now it 's warm and dry at the stock show , where cows and cowboys alike are the stars of the show .			2

the @entity5 has taken *place* in @entity0 for over a century
it 's part state fair , part rodeo
there are beauty *contests* for livestock , even *chickens* and *roosters*
