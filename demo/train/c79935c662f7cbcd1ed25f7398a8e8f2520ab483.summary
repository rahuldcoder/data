-- welcome back , @entity1			1
it 's been two years since the @entity4 - winning artist made a stellar debut with his album " @entity7 , " and on friday he quietly delivered a new song called " @entity9			1
" while many musicians would roll out the @entity13 red carpet for a new track , @entity10 unveiled the meditative " @entity9 " without any fanfare on his @entity16			1
you can listen to the single on his site , frankocean.tumblr.com			0
the mood of " @entity9 " feels similar to some of @entity10 's work on " @entity7 , " but it 's experimental in his delivery			1
rather than simply singing all of the song 's lines , @entity10 employs a more staccato , spoken - word delivery , saving his distinct vocals to close out the song			1
the lyrics themselves are intimate , telling the story of a sensual relationship			0
" i memorized the wayward expressions / never look down / never let you see me down			0
i memorized the way no directions , " @entity10 says in the song			2
" can i come over now , i 'd like to stay a little while			0
i memorized your body exposed / i could f * * * you all night long / from a memory alone			0
" it 's unclear if " @entity9 " is a sign of what 's to come on @entity10 's highly anticipated second album , but it 's a relief for fans who 've been eager to hear more			2
in 2012 , " @entity7 " was a critical success , winning the @entity4 for best urban contemporary album , and rumors of what 's to come from the artist have been circling ever since			1
what we do know is that @entity10 has been hard at work			0
@entity61 reports that he 's been clocking studio time with producers such as @entity65 and @entity66 .			2

@entity1 unveiled a new song friday
it 's been two years since his *acclaimed* debut album , " @entity7 "
