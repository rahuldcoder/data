the sides drew 1 - 1 in the first leg			1

@entity11 are dominant in the league but seem to be faltering without their manager @entity44 who has been absent since the beginning of february while he has treatment for throat cancer in @entity48			2

@entity69 claimed a penalty as @entity11 looked to level the tie but the referee waved away his appeals before @entity74 cut in from the right and fired wide of the target			0
@entity11 's best chance of the half came when @entity79 brought down @entity74 on the edge of the penalty area			2
@entity52 stepped up to take the free kick but though the ball beat the wall it flashed a foot wide of the post			0
@entity88 forced @entity4 goalkeeper @entity89 into his first save of the match with a shot from the edge of the area that took a deflection off @entity96 international @entity95			0
but @entity61 struck a decisive second just before the hour mark			0
a long ball downfield saw @entity100 beat @entity11 captain @entity101 and though his shot was saved by @entity103 , @entity61 was on hand to tuck home his 16th goal in 19 cup games for @entity4			1
it got worse for @entity11 as @entity4 's young @entity110 centre half @entity111 rose unchecked from a corner to head home a third goal that truly knocked the stuffing out of the home side			1
@entity117 grabbed a late consolation goal for @entity11 but by that time many of the 90,000 fans had made their way to the exits			0
@entity4 will face either city rivals @entity123 or @entity125 in the final			0
