@entity1 -- " lone wolves " who plot to carry out small - scale attacks on soft targets , like those in which seven people have been killed in @entity10 , could be the future of terrorism , a security expert has warned			1
" we are witnessing the next stage of terrorism in @entity22 , " said @entity14 , director of @entity15 at the @entity16 , a @entity1 - based counterterrorism think tank			1
@entity23 is suspected of carrying out a series of shootings in which seven people , three of them young children , have died in recent days			0
@entity23 , 23 , a self - styled @entity27 jihadist , was found dead after a 31 - hour siege at his home in @entity10 on thursday			0
@entity14 told @entity2 that killings like those in @entity32 and @entity33 would likely inspire other radical islamists to action			1
" this has sent out the message that followers of @entity27 can carry out successful attacks , can precipitate terror , on their own			0
" this is exactly what happened in @entity10 : people were scared to go out , schools were under guard , there was a real sense of insecurity -- that is true terrorism			1
" he said the actions of @entity53 , whose twin bomb and gun attacks in @entity56 and on the island of @entity58 in @entity59 in july last year left 77 people dead , had also encouraged would - be terrorists			2
" although it was n't linked to @entity27 , the @entity59 attack set a dangerous precedent , because it showed that a plot like this could succeed			0
" and @entity14 said there were fears the upcoming @entity68 , due to be held in @entity1 this summer , could be targeted			1
" the sort of attack we 've seen in @entity32 is not a model that is unique to @entity10 -- it could be replicated in @entity73 , in @entity74 , or elsewhere -- and that is a real concern , especially in the lead - up to the @entity68 in @entity1 later this year			1
" the @entity68 are of symbolic significance , because the day after the 2012 games were awarded to @entity1 , in 2005 , we had the 7/7 bombings [ on public transport , in which 52 people were killed ]			1
" and so there is a sort of a scar associated with that , and it could be that those who sympathize with the motives of the bombers see the @entity68 as a symbolic time to attack			2
" but he said counter-terrorism forces faced a major challenge in tackling ' lone wolf ' attacks			1
" they are a real headache for the authorities , because they are very difficult to thwart : if a ' cell ' is only one or two people it 's a lot harder to monitor their activities , to trace their networks , and so on			2
" in previous cases , the ability of the authorities to disrupt the planning stage has been low , because you do n't get the leakage of information that you get with a larger cell			0
" @entity23 , the suspect in the @entity10 killings , was a supporter of radical @entity119 group @entity117 , the @entity120 , @entity10 's interior minister @entity115 said			2
@entity14 said the organization , which has members in @entity123 and @entity124 in central @entity10 , acts as an " antechamber towards terrorism , " encouraging its followers to go abroad for training			1
" before it was banned earlier this year , it had posted a chilling warning on @entity131 , encouraging its followers to attack @entity132 , @entity133 and @entity10 soldiers , " said @entity14			1
" unfortunately , that threat seems to have been carried out in recent days			0
" the security analyst told @entity138 's role in the @entity32 and @entity33 killings remained unclear			0
" there are two schools of thought -- that it could be an @entity27 - controlled attack , or that it could be an @entity27 - inspired attack -- and either way , it 's a real concern			0
" if it 's @entity27 - controlled , it shows that @entity27 is still able to recruit @entity22 - based followers , and to train and guide them into carrying out attacks			0
" if it 's @entity27 - inspired , then it 's the first ' lone wolf ' act of terror of its kind to succeed in the @entity156			2
there have been many @entity27 - inspired attempts , but so far they have all failed -- are we seeing that in this instance it has succeeded ? "			0

" lone wolves " who carry out attacks on soft targets could be future of terrorism , expert warns
killing of seven people , *including* three children , in @entity10 could inspire radical islamists to action
@entity14 : lone wolf attacks " very difficult to thwart " because of lack of information leaks
@entity68 in @entity1 later this year could be " symbolic target , " says @entity14
