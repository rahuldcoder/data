@entity0 was just a 26 - year - old nursing student when he had unprotected sex with another man and , as a result , got the diagnosis that changed his life			1
" i started to feel like i had the flu -- aches , pains , chills , fever , swollen lymph nodes , that kind of thing -- and so i went to my doctor ... we did a viral load test , which was rare back then ... and he called me and said , you know , it came back ( @entity21 ) positive			1
@entity0 's doctor immediately sent him to the @entity24 , where research was being done , but treatment options were , at the time , still few			1
patients were being treated with @entity28 , the first drug approved by the @entity30 in 1987 to treat @entity31 in the @entity32 -- by then known for its serious , even life - threatening side effects			2
the reality of the diagnosis set in			2
" i was so sick , " @entity0 says			1
" i was sitting silently and crying because of my circumstance ... and the nurse came over and was trying to console me , i believe , and said ... ' because you were just infected , you may have , you know , six or eight years before you die			0
' " i think she was trying to cheer me up , " he says			0
" did n't work very well , but that 's just a good commentary on where we were at the time " @entity47 : where to put the smart money to end @entity31 that was then , but what does it mean to have @entity21 today , after years of research and advances in treatment ? " it means likely you can have a normal lifespan and have a similar life to someone who does not have @entity21 , " says dr. @entity56 , chief medical officer at @entity57 in @entity58 , which provides health care services for the lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender community			1
" for people who had to deal with the medications and stuff from the ' 80s and ' 90s , it was a bit of a rough road there , so figuring out the virus and the medications that would work effectively with the least side effects , it took a while , " @entity56 says			0
" but now we 're at the point where we have three options for one pill , once - a - day regimens with very little side effects			0
" in 1981 , when the virus was discovered , being hiv - positive was considered a death sentence			1
for most patients today , it 's a chronic disease , much like diabetes or heart disease			2
@entity0 is a perfect example			1
he has been living with the disease for 21 years and today is a healthy 47 - year - old			2
instead of the difficult treatment regimen he was on back then			0
which included some 40 pills five times a day with " horrific " side effects , he now takes five pills twice a day " with virtually no side effects , " he says			0
for the last 7Â½ years , @entity0 , who is a registered nurse , has worked at @entity103 in a variety of positions , including director of nursing and in case management			1
he sees potentially thousands of patients each year , and has personally delivered the same news he got two decades ago to more than 200 patients			0
but he tells them living with @entity21 today means that you can be healthy , thrive and live a normal lifespan without complications			1
" you can go to your doctor two , three times a year , get some tests done and make sure everything 's on track , and then just live the rest of your life as you would , " he says			1
" follow your dreams ... have your career , your family , or whatever it is that you 'd like to do with your life , and that is the truth of where we are			0
" today 's science , he said , supports that			0
interactive : @entity132 2013 " we are at a place that we actually have the tools we need to stop the epidemic and then just get to a point where we 're just taking care of the people who have @entity21 throughout their life , " he says			1
" but because of how horrible the first 10 , 20 years of this ( epidemic ) was , we have collectively this culture of what it means to be infected and affected by @entity21 that still is this huge block , this huge barrier for people understanding that they can get into care and they can be ok and that it 's not something to be afraid of			1
" about 1.1 million @entity32 live with @entity21 , according to the @entity149			1
but because of improved treatments , they 're living longer and their quality of life is better			1
" if a person is @entity21 infected today , it is important that they put themselves under the care of a physician experienced in caring for @entity21 - infected individuals , " says dr. @entity153 , director of the @entity154 at the @entity24			1
" depending on the stage of infection , it is highly likely that it will be recommended that the person begin antiretroviral therapy ( @entity168 )			0
" @entity168 is a combination of at least three antiretroviral drugs that prevents the virus from replicating			0
it can also help reduce virus transmission			0
unlike years ago , when effective treatments were not available , @entity21 patients now benefit significantly from @entity168 , @entity153 says			2
" these drugs are highly effective in suppressing @entity21 replication and , if taken as directed , can result in the @entity21 - infected individual having an almost normal lifespan without experiencing serious illness related to their @entity21 infection			1
" and so , on this 25th @entity132 , @entity0 has mixed emotions			2
it 's a day that , in the past , has been incredibly sad and traumatic for him			0
now , he says , he has tremendous hope			0
" i see the freight train being slowed down so that we can turn it around , " he says			0
" even five , six years ago , i 'm not sure that i could have said that i had the hope that that was going to happen , but i think we 're at that point we 're at a really historical moment with this			0
" each november in advance of @entity132 , @entity192 , an award winning magazine started in 1994 to provide education and information for people living with and affected by the disease , names its " @entity192 " -- @entity21 - positive people who are unsung heroes in the fight against @entity31 , and committed to ending the epidemic			2
this year , @entity0 is on that list			2
@entity132 25 years on : it 's time to stop saying ' @entity204 '			0

@entity0 thought his 1992 diagnosis was a death sentence
today , he *counsels* others that they can live a *fairly* normal life
treatment *breakthroughs* and research have improved the *outlook* for @entity21
