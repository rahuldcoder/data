@entity0 , @entity1 -- the phone call came from my uncle -- a captain on a superyacht -- offering me a seasonal job as a stewardess			2
having absolutely no experience and no idea what the job would entail , where it would take me and how i would fare in rough conditions , i jumped at the chance			2
within the week i had arranged my @entity16 at the @entity17 , booked in the obligatory safety course ( @entity19 95 ) , had a medical , packed up the accumulation of goods a girl at 22 owns and flew across to the @entity23			2
i arrived just in time for the @entity24 armed with a reckless dash of confidence , a hefty dose of enthusiasm and sea sick pills			2
despite discovering that it is indeed true , one can turn a certain shade of green ; what started as one season has now turned into six years of life working as a stewardess , and now chief stewardess , on superyachts			1
the industry is a curious one			1
unless you have actually worked on a white boat it is near impossible to understand the life of a crew member			2
from an outsiders perspective cruising in a luxury floating hotel to glamorous and exotic locations on an all - expenses paid trip does indeed sound luxurious , amazing , and enviable			2

as someone who has taken the plunge below deck , i can tell you , yachting is an industry of extreme highs and extremes lows			1
yes you are indeed gracing the ports of @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 and @entity72 but , in reality , the key sights are usually seen through a small round window not dissimilar from the sort you see on @entity76			1
@entity78 tourism i like to call it			2
in season , rarely do you have the energy to tear yourself away from scrubbing the porcelain throne to take in the salty foreign air			0
an irregular heart beat from the @entity84 running through your veins , is a necessary hazard after 36 hours of " yes siring " to a plethora of demanding billionaires all whilst maintaining that smile on your dial			0
check out @entity93 's website for more inside info there really is no typical day onboard a superyacht			1
workload and the sort of work changes depending on the season , whether you have guests on board and any maintenance issues			1
a superyacht requires never ending upkeep			0
the yacht needs to be kept in immaculate condition and the crew need always need to be prepared for any situation			0
salaries on board a yacht are dependent on position , qualifications , yacht size , where the yacht is located and if is private or charter			0
in general , a slightly higher salary is offered if the yacht is private with the hope if you work on a charter that you will make up your salary with tips			1
a person in my position with experience can hope to make from $ 3500 - $ 6000 a month , not including tips , while inexperienced crew can hope to earn around $ 2000 - 3000 a month			0
on a busy and successful charter yacht you can hope to make tips of around 5 to 15 % of the cost of the charter per week divided amongst the crew			0
in recent years tips are not as extravagant as they once were but you can hope to make approximately $ 1000 usd a week in tips			1
with a busy charter yacht completing approximately 10 weeks of charter a season			0
possibly the most extraordinary situation i experienced and -- we were totally unprepared for it -- came when the captain of the yacht i was working on fell sick and went into a coma			1
we were docked on an isolated island in the @entity146 and had no means of transport to get the captain and his distraught wife ( who was also the chef on board ) to the closest hospital			0
luckily for us , a couple had just tied the knot on the beach near our boat and we had to hitch a ride with the newlyweds to a place where the captain and his wife could be airlifted out			0

we did n't have time to contact them to let them know we were now down a captain and a chef , had no time for provisions , no access to money , no way to steer the boat and not enough crew			0
we did , however , have champagne , a freezer full of lobster and some culinary skills between us			1
somehow we managed to pull it off with some cruises around in our tender and made an attempt at gourmet meals			0
thankfully the captain survived and was back at work after a couple of months			1
working on a superyacht is very hard work ; you have to be at the beck and call of guests who have some quite particular requests that are almost impossible to fulfill			1
one particularly challenging one was from a lady having a bad hair day who wanted a seaplane to take her from @entity204 to a hair stylist in @entity206 ! i 've also had guests who pre-ordered 100 bottles of vodka for their week - long trip but polished it all off just days into their charter , they wanted me to somehow organize another 100 bottles of their luxury brand spirit from the middle of the ocean			0
there are the simple things too like making sure you have the language of choice newspapers and particular imported coffee and the preferred wine on hand at all times , from wherever you may be in the world			1
we had a particular diva celebrity who required full body make up every day before she left her cabin and a group of @entity234 guests who brought with them suitcases full of pig lard to accompany their whiskey			1
whatever the guests require it is our job to make sure they get it			0
although we do everything in our power to provide them with a six star service , @entity241 is not always so obliging			0
encountering bad weather and rough seas is inevitable and makes trying to keep guests happy ( and from vomiting ) quite a challenge			0
see also : is @entity251 the new sailing hub ? that aside , after serving , ironing , cooking , chamoising and putting up with bulimic supermodels , there is a real sense of triumph when you complete a two - week or two - month stint with guests on board a 24/7 running ( and you are literally running ) superyacht			0
it is times like these when you might just get a day or a night to explore the splendid ports of call all with a nice big gratuity in your pocket			2
these kind of opportunities are extraordinary and for that moment any trials you may encounter with the world 's wealthiest whilst facing unruly seas , unpredictable weather and even more unpredictable and unruly guests , diminishes			1
for all the challenges yachting presents , i actually enjoy the rush , the work and the lifestyle ( just do n't ask me that after cleaning up after a boat full of sea sick guests ! )			1
i am grateful for the education i have received whilst contributing to running these superyachts and the opportunity to travel the world whilst saving my pennies			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity294 .			1

@entity294 has been working on superyachts for six years
her work has taken her to some of the world 's most *famous* ports
she says the yachting industry is full of extreme highs and extremes lows
