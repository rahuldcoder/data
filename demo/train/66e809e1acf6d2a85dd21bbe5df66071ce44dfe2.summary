a century ago this saturday on a street corner in @entity2 , @entity0 fired the shot that started @entity4 when he killed archduke @entity5			1
what do we know about history 's greatest teenage troublemaker ? 1			0
his name was @entity0 , or @entity12			1
our history teachers taught us that @entity4 began after a gunman killed archduke @entity5 in @entity2 on june 28 , 1914			1
the shooting acted as a trigger , metastasizing from a @entity18 street corner into a continental crisis by releasing pent - up tension between rival blocs of @entity22 : the @entity23 and @entity24 on one side and @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28 on the other			1
the name of the gunman was @entity0 , his first name meaning @entity12 in his mother tongue , @entity34			2
his mother had wanted to call him @entity36 after her late brother , but the local priest intervened saying the boy should be name after the @entity12			0
statue of assassin who unleashed @entity4 unveiled in @entity2 2			1
he was only 19 when he triggered the first global conflict			0
surely history 's greatest teenage troublemaker , @entity0 was a student in his last year of high school -- the eighth grade -- when he fired the shot that sparked @entity4 his exact age was a matter of intense legal scrutiny after the assassination because so many people in @entity23 believed a death sentence appropriate for the assassin who had killed the heir to the @entity58			1
but the @entity23 legal code was clear on capital punishment			2
only those 20 years of age or older on the day of the offense could be executed			0
the recorded birth date for @entity0 was 13 july , 1894 , making him 19 years , 11 months and 15 days on the day of the assassination , in other words just two weeks inside the deadline that would have seen him hanged			1
it all got a bit complicated when a council record was found by investigators that suggested he had actually been born on 13 june 1894 , making him old enough to execute			0
but after much legal debate it was accepted that this record was a mistake -- the month of july in the cyrillic script used by the parish can easily be mistaken for june			0
@entity0 was sentenced to 20 years in prison -- the maximum penalty for someone his age at the time -- but would be dead before the guns of @entity4 fell silent , dying of tuberculosis in the hospital at his jail on april 28 , 1918			1
he had the same nationality as @entity90			0
100 years ago , at the twilight of the grand imperial era , the notions of the nation state and of nationality belonged to the future			0
countries like @entity98 , the @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity23 and @entity101 did not exist			2
instead they were bundled together in the sprawling @entity58 , also known as @entity23 , a muddle of divergent ethnic groups often speaking very different languages , and of varying vintages , all under the imperial control of @entity109 -- the system was so chaotic that in parts of the empire vehicles drove on the left , elsewhere on the right			2
@entity0 was born in a province of @entity23 that had recently been acquired , an area known as @entity116			1
for centuries it had been occupied by the @entity119 but in 1878 it was " flipped , " becoming @entity122 territory overnight			0
its citizens did not have passports but they did have travel passes , and as a young man @entity0 qualified for the same type of pass as that given to @entity90 , who was born further to the northwest , but still within the @entity23			1
as an assassin , @entity0 had the luck of the devil			2
the driver of the @entity137 's car should have driven straight past @entity0 at speed but , because of a misunderstanding , he turned the car on the exact corner where @entity0 was standing and was immediately shouted at to stop			2
@entity0 found his target a sitting duck right in front of him			2
he fired only one shot at the @entity137 with a pistol			2
by a fluke the bullet cut @entity5 's jugular vein			2
he was dead in a matter of minutes			0
he was not a @entity152 nationalist			0
@entity0 was actually a south @entity154 nationalist ; although ethnically a @entity155 , he supported a group of activists calling for the unification of all local @entity154 people in @entity116 : muslims , @entity161 and @entity152			1
their dream was to drive out the @entity122 occupier , so shooting the @entity137 was seen as a " grand gesture " to inspire others to rise up against the foreign power			0
the plan worked , but at a terrible price			0
the shooting triggered a war that @entity0 could never have anticipated			0
millions died and empires fell -- and eventually , the hated @entity23 were driven out of @entity116			1
as a result , the local @entity154 had the chance to unite in one country , later called @entity176 , meaning a nation for south @entity154			1
in the eyes of some locals there , @entity0 could be heralded as a " liberator			0
" 7 : his legacy in the @entity18 was toxic			0
the wars that ripped @entity116 apart in the 1990s were driven by ethnic divisions between the local @entity154 communities : @entity152 , @entity187 , @entity188			1
the dream of all local @entity154 living together was shattered			0
though @entity0 fired his gun a hundred years ago in hopes of freeing his @entity154 kinfolk , today he is " blamed " for being an ethnic @entity155 , tainted by association with those extremists responsible for committing atrocities during the @entity18 war			1
the issue is so toxic that , as the centenary of the june 28 , 1914 assassination approached , in @entity116 there was no national consensus on how it should be acknowledged			1
history 's greatest teenage troublemaker is also , perhaps , history 's most toxic teenage troublemaker			0
