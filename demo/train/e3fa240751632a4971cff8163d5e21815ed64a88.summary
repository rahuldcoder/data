@entity0 -- last week we learned that @entity5 and @entity4 's effective tax rate for 2011 was 20.5 %			1
they had adjusted gross income of $ 789,674			0
we also learned that their tax rate was slightly lower than president @entity4 's secretary , who had about $ 95,000 of income			1
ours is supposed to be a progressive rate system , which means as income gets higher , so do tax rates			1
in a true progressive rate system , @entity4 would never pay a lower tax rate than his secretary			1
we also know that @entity20 and @entity21 have a projected effective tax rate of 15 % for 2011			1
they have requested an extension so we do n't have their actual returns			0
their household income was just shy of $ 21 million			0
in a true progressive tax system , the @entity28 would never pay a lower tax rate than the @entity31			1
we do not have a progressive tax system			1
the notion of a progressive tax system is the lie that has been perpetuated far too long			1
first , not all income is taxed the same			0
while our income tax has always had progressive rates , for most of the 20th century a lower rate applied to certain nonwage income			1
that rate differential was increased dramatically as a result of the @entity44 tax cuts			1
most of the @entity28 ' income comes from stock ownership			0
stock dividends and capital gains are generally not subject to our progressive rate system			1
income from stock is taxed at a flat 15 % rate			1
fewer than 1 in 5 @entity54 owns stock in a way that qualifies for the flat rate			1
of that minority , very few benefit the way the @entity28 do			0
an analysis of @entity63 statistics show that for households up to $ 200,000 , no more than about 5 % of their income is eligible for the flat 15 % rate			1
those households combined represent well more than 90 % of @entity54 households			0
the @entity69 included a proposal that all income should be taxed the same			0
while some would say that is a radical step , it is precisely what we did in 1986			2
second , not all deductions are treated the same			0
two - thirds of all taxpayers do not itemize their deductions but take the standard deduction			0
so , as a result , most @entity54 do not even benefit from the myriad of special interest group deductions found in our tax code			2
in addition , under a progressive tax system , the value of a deduction depends upon what rate your last dollar is taxed			1
that is referred to as your marginal tax rate			1
the more income you have , the higher your marginal tax rate and the greater the value of the deduction			1
for example , if your marginal tax rate is 35 % , then for every dollar you spend , you save 35 cents			2
if your marginal tax rate is 15 % , then for every dollar you spend , you save only 15 cents			2
that explains why those in higher income brackets seek out tax deductions as a way to save money on their taxes			2
third , all of this is supposed to be a secret			0
the only reason we have the information is because taxpayers voluntarily disclosed it -- either because they are presidential candidates or concerned citizens such as investor @entity119			0
the @entity63 statistics do a great job of masking this information because the real problem lies within the top 1 % of taxpayers , and the data are not presented in a way that isolates that group			0
@entity128 decides to enact a tax law , and the president signs the bill			0
while presidents voluntarily release their tax returns , members of @entity128 do not			0
the first step toward real tax reform would be for every member of @entity128 to release his or her tax return			2
we can see which tax provisions benefit them , and we can compare their effective tax rates with our own			2
achieving meaningful tax reform will require very few steps			0
first , tax all forms of income at the same rate			2
second , repeal the progressive tax system and enact a flat tax			1
if a flat tax is good enough for @entity20 and @entity21 , it should be good enough for the rest of us			2
most flat tax proponents , however , want a flat tax , but they want to exempt income from stock completely			2
that would mean @entity20 and @entity21 's already low 15 % effective tax rate would be cut even further			1
that would be wrong - headed tax reform			0
finally , most deductions should be eliminated			0
most taxpayers do not itemize , so this change would only affect about one - third of taxpayers -- and their accountants and tax lawyers			0
whenever @entity128 enacts a deduction , it creates winners and losers			0
to be sure , every special interest group will oppose even the hint of this suggestion			0
i do n't think it 's fair that the richest @entity54 pay taxes at a lower rate than most taxpayers and neither should you			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity187 .			2

@entity187 : we live with the myth that we have a progressive tax system
in fact , she says , *people* like @entity194 , @entity195 pay at lower rates than secretaries
she says the low flat rate on dividends and capital gains *protects* the *wealthy*
@entity187 : getting *rid* of the progressive tax brackets is a step toward a fairer system
