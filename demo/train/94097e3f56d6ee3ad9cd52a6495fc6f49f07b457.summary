-- prince @entity2 's last visit to the @entity3 , in august 2012 , did not end well , after photographs of him romping naked around a @entity6 hotel suite were published worldwide -- just weeks before he began his tour of duty in @entity8			1
" i probably let myself down , i let my family down , i let other people down , " he said in an interview a few weeks later			0
" it was probably a classic example of me probably being too much army , and not enough prince			0
" @entity2 argued at the time that it happened in a private area and that he should have been able to expect a certain amount of privacy			1
expect him to redress the balance then on his next visit to the @entity3 , which begins on thursday			1
and he wo n't be stopping in @entity6			1
his private secretary , @entity22 , has reassuringly confirmed that the prince will " fulfil his duties with his inimitable style in all he does			0
" he has a point			0
no - one does royal tours quite like @entity2 , and he 's clearly fond of the @entity3 , visiting several times during the years , both in official and private capacities			1
this is the prince who dispensed with handshakes when he met @entity34 prime minister @entity33 in march 2012 and gave her a hug instead ( he said he had heard that she liked hugs			2
) on the same day he also challenged @entity38 multi-medallist @entity37 to a race and then went on to impersonate @entity40 during a state dinner			0
if there is a @entity37 moment in the @entity3 , it will be on a baseball diamond in @entity46 on tuesday			2
but striking a baseball is n't as easy as it looks -- has @entity2 been practicing ? he is competitive and will at least be on more of a level playing field when he captains a polo team during a match in @entity52 on wednesday			2
it 's a sport he excels at , but such events are as much about socializing -- and @entity2 's presence is fast turning it into the society event of the year			2
this is , after all , the man who ultimately has the power to turn women into princesses -- or at least duchesses			0
but @entity2 is n't coming to the @entity3 to find a wife , officially at least			1
instead , he 's carrying out a dual role : representing the interests of his charities and those of the @entity69			1
he 's a big asset for the @entity69 government , able to attract a-list political , corporate and showbiz guests to receptions at tour stops in @entity75 , @entity76 and @entity46			2
a royal source has described his visit , which also includes a visit to a community devastated by @entity81 , as " gentle diplomacy			0
" the source also tells me one core element of the tour will be the weekend @entity87 in @entity88 , which are best described as the @entity89 for injured and wounded war veterans			0
@entity22 , himself a former special forces officer , describes @entity2 as a " soldier 's soldier " who wants to highlight the commitment and sacrifice of " our wounded warriors			2
" like any serving officer , @entity2 will have at the back of his mind that one day he could be wounded in combat			0
expect then to see a very sombre and thoughtful prince @entity2 / captain @entity104 in ceremonial uniform when he lays a wreath at the @entity108 at @entity109 thursday			1
for prince @entity2 is a soldier and a prince : both will be on duty for this tour , if a bit more prince than during his last visit			1
and those lucky enough to meet him should n't forget to ask if his pregnant sister - in - law @entity117 of @entity118 -- is expecting a girl or a boy this summer			0
that would create headlines -- and for much happier reasons than last time			0
