-- @entity1 is home to the tallest building , largest mall and biggest candy shop			1
recently , however , the city proved that its penchant for the extra large is n't limited to the inanimate			1
last week , the @entity8 became home to a giant pacific octopus -- the largest species of octopus on the planet			1
the newest occupant , who lives at the mall 's @entity14 , stretches out to a fear - inducing 14 feet , and weighs over 70 kilograms ( 154 pounds )			0
earlier this month , the aquarium announced it had acquired one of the largest known reptiles on the planet , a 1,600 - pound crocodile they 've dubbed @entity21 ( they also flew in his companion , @entity22 )			2
@entity23 , a theme park consultant and the managing director at @entity26 , notes that the mall 's current preoccupation with large animals is consistent with the @entity31 's obsession with record - breaking pursuits			2
" in a general , entertainment attractions have always been a way for countries to have bragging rights in the world			0
by having the best , the biggest and the fastest of everything , @entity1 wants to show they 've arrived on the world stage			1
in many ways , having record - breaking animals is another way to do that , " he says			2
the country is no stranger to peppering its entertainment offerings with animals exotic to the region			1
in 2012 , @entity1 -- the indoor ski slope housed at @entity53 -- welcomed a colony of @entity21 and @entity56 penguins			1
in 2008 , @entity59 , the @entity58 hotel courted controversy from animal rights groups when it hosted a whale shark in its in - built aquarium			0
" lately , you 're seeing attractions where you would n't typically find animals adding them in			2
it 's a merging of concepts			0
at @entity59 , you have a lodging using an animal attraction as an amenity to justify higher room rates and occupancy , " explains @entity23			0
it 's a concept that does n't sit well with local animal rights groups			0
" in the wild , crocodiles spent hours swimming and can regulate the buoyancy and temperature or their bodies			1
no enclosure -- no matter how large -- is able to provide crocodiles with everything that is natural and important to them , " says @entity81 , the @entity82 and @entity83 senior campaigner for @entity84 ( @entity84 )			0
" if the @entity8 wants to set itself apart from the rest , there are other ways to do that than imprisoning wild animals in concrete enclosures and taking away everything that is natural and important to them , " she adds			1
in a statement , @entity96 , the developers for the @entity8 , note that @entity21 and his companion were obtained from a crocodile farm in @entity101			1
they add that the transfer was facilitated in partnership with @entity101 government authorities , who reviewed the quality of the display , qualifications of the staff caring for the animals and the educational purpose of the exhibit			0
@entity96 also notes that the habitat made for the two crocodiles is three times the size specified by the @entity116			0
the country 's fascination with wild animals is n't always limited to the indoors			1
last year the @entity122 's @entity121 issued bans on the commercial and personal import of a variety of exotic animals -- including many big cats and primates -- yet they remain popular pets for many @entity122 , who see them as a status symbol			1
several locals have shot to @entity135 fame showcasing their exotic animal collection			2
" unfortunately , the trade in exotic animals is largely unregulated and statistics are very difficult to come by , " says @entity81			1
" the animals pay the price for this trade			0
many do n't survive the journey from their homes in the wild , and those that do often die prematurely from malnutrition , an unnatural environment , loneliness and the overwhelming stress of confinement			0
" still , she does note that animal rights -- though a newer concept in the @entity122 -- is on the rise			2
" awareness is growing by the day , and new animal welfare groups are popping up in the region all the time , " she says .			0

the @entity8 recently acquired a giant *squid* and two crocodiles
animals in malls are not *uncommon* . @entity1 now houses a penguin colony
the @entity122 has long exhibited a penchant for exotic animals
many locals even keep wild game as pets
