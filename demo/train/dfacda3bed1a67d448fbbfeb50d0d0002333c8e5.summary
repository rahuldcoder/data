but soon , he 'll have power and an old enemy , president @entity2 , is already in his sights			1
in the latest redemptive twist of a career of political and personal ups and downs , the @entity6 @entity5 senator will take on one of the most weighty jobs in @entity12 when the new @entity5 majority rolls into town next month			1
as chairman of the @entity16 , @entity0 will hold the @entity17 to account for what he sees as a feckless foreign policy that has enabled " genocide " in @entity20 , left " evil " to fill a leadership vacuum elsewhere and splintered @entity25 's moral example around the world			1
" history judges people by what is accomplished or is not accomplished , whether there has been victory or defeat , that is the ultimate judgment , " @entity0 said when asked by @entity27 to rate @entity2 's record as a statesman			1
" i think you could argue that the world is vastly changed and it certainly is not to the benefit of democracy , freedom or @entity25 's role in the world			1
" @entity0 's new post is an unexpected coda for a turbulent life in which he was tortured as a @entity55 prisoner - of - war , emerged from a savings and loan scandal as a campaign finance champion and was a maverick who beat cancer and dubbed adoring reporters on his campaign bus his " base			1
" now , from his perch on @entity57 , @entity0 will be back where he is happiest , where the political fight is at its most intense			1
he has a chance to reshape his own legacy , and ensure that the last word on his political career is not two losing presidential campaigns and his pick of running mate @entity66 , who critics blasted as unqualified to be a heartbeat away from the presidency			1
@entity72 aides will soon find themselves trooping up to @entity73 for inquisitions before his committee			0
@entity0 is promising to use the power of the purse to force @entity2 's hand on key issues including @entity80 and @entity20			1
@entity0 also wants to end sequester budget cuts he says are stifling the military and cost overruns that plague the @entity85 's procurement process			1
he 's planning to form a powerful triumvirate with sen. @entity87 , incoming chairman of the @entity88 and sen. @entity89 , the new head of the @entity91 , to drive the foreign policy agenda			1
confrontation he 's planning to confront the @entity17 on @entity20 , @entity80 , @entity94 nuclear talks , the struggle against @entity96 and the president 's decision to establish diplomatic ties with communist @entity100			0
republicans are also expected to use funding bills for government departments to constrain administration foreign policy in some areas and to target it in others , in effect daring @entity2 to veto wider bills that include elements he might oppose			1
in the six years since @entity2 beat him in the presidential race , @entity0 has been seething from the sidelines , prompting some to caricature him as an " angry old man " squandering a reputation for heroism and integrity			1
it 's been an odd kind of political purgatory , since it 's rare there 's a day he 's not on cable tv			0
@entity0 has also had some victories , helping torpedo @entity2 's preferred pick for secretary of state , @entity125 , and ridiculing @entity17 political appointees for ambassadorial posts , including a soap opera producer dispatched to @entity129			1
opinion : @entity0 's political comeback but he has been unable to change the substance of @entity2 's foreign policy			1
the president has ignored @entity0 's calls for the @entity25 to align much more closely with moderate rebels in the cauldron of @entity20 's civil war			1
his hawkish recommendations on confronting @entity140 have also gone unheard			0
his searing criticism did not stop @entity2 pulling out of @entity142 , though @entity5 claim vindication following the rise of @entity96			1
but @entity0 will come out of the wilderness in january			2
in the interview , he decried a " vacuum created by the lack of @entity25 leadership which has been filled in by evil influences			2
" " countries no longer believe in @entity25 leadership , so therefore , they are making their own accommodations , not only in the @entity153 but also in what used to be eastern @entity155 , " he said			2
it 's a worldview reflected on the walls of @entity0 's @entity16 conference room , which features letters and photos from the likes of @entity162 and @entity163 , leaders who drew firm ideological lines and did n't suffer critics gladly			1
at times , @entity0 's moral outrage over @entity20 or @entity80 seems to burst out of him and contrasts with the cold - eyed realism of a president who believes he was elected to end wars , not to get into new quagmires			2
' immoral ' " we are watching one of the great episodes of genocide certainly in our century , " @entity0 said , when asked to assess @entity2 's @entity20 policy			1
" two hundred thousand people dead , 3.5 million refugees , 150,000 still languishing in ( @entity20 leader ) @entity182 's prisons			0
" he added : " we have basically sat by and done very little ... what we are doing is not only unworkable , it 's immoral			0
" @entity186 see @entity0 as the embodiment of a @entity5 reflex to respond to every global problem with military force , which led @entity25 into misadventures like the war in @entity142			1
some @entity2 aides also believe @entity0 never truly accepted his loss in 2008 , and see him as now more interested in political fireworks than serious legislating			1
@entity2 clearly had the likes of @entity0 on his mind when he mounted a defense of his foreign policy with @entity27 's @entity201 on sunday			1
" there is this knee jerk sense on the part of some of the foreign policy establishment that shooting first and thinking about it second projects strength			1
i disagree with that , " @entity2 said			2
prospective @entity5 presidential candidate @entity211 , fighting claims he is an isolationist , meanwhile said at a @entity213 forum this month that @entity0 wants 15 more wars			2
in recent months , @entity0 's fury has spilled out in committee hearing showdowns with top officials including secretary of state @entity218 and his new deputy , @entity220			2
" it 's too bad you ca n't answer straightforward questions , mr. @entity220 , " @entity0 said in an interrogation which angered allies of the popular @entity17 official			2
@entity0 also lacerated @entity227 , a fellow veteran of @entity55 and the @entity16 , who stumbled through a notorious confirmation hearing last year on the way to becoming defense secretary			1
people who know @entity0 are not at all shocked he 's still trading punches and not walking off into the @entity6 sunset after a lifetime of service			2
he often notes that his father and grandfather died soon after retirement and does n't plan to make the same mistake			0
" it does n't surprise me at all			0
he has always been someone to run to the sound of the guns , and be in the arena where important decisions are being made , " said @entity241 , who worked for @entity0 for five years as a foreign policy adviser			1
but at 78 , and uncertain whether @entity5 can hold their majority in 2016 , there is a certain poignancy to @entity0			2
' running out of time ' " i 'm running out of time , " he snapped last month , cutting off @entity218 in a five minute @entity252 , offering a metaphor for a career approaching its final act with much left to say and do			0
there 's also the question of his own @entity16 seat which tops the list for @entity262 insurgents looking for @entity5 scalps			2
@entity0 says he 's close to announcing a run for a sixth term in 2016 -- which would take him through to age 86 -- and expects a tough fight			2
former @entity268 ambassador @entity267 , who now runs @entity270 's @entity269 , says the senator is simply not done fighting			0
" he has a strong sense of values and character , " @entity267 said			0
" his book ' character is @entity277 ' is all about how character determines a person and determines events			0
he continues to want to fight for what needs to be done			0
" that streak of idealism underpins some of @entity0 's most admired political achievements -- for example his role in normalizing diplomatic relations with @entity55 , which required an embrace of a nation which incarcerated him			0
it was on display again this month when , with the moral authority of a torture victim , he was a rare @entity5 to back a report outlining harsh interrogation methods			0
" the truth is sometimes a hard pill to swallow , " @entity0 said on the floor			0
" it sometimes causes us difficulties at home and abroad			0
it is sometimes used by our enemies in attempts to hurt us			0
but the @entity25 people are entitled to it nonetheless			0
" the speech won near universal praise , especially from liberals			0
" breathtaking , " said vice president @entity311			0
@entity313 host @entity312 quipped : " @entity314 " â€” " i 've missed you so much			0
i did n't think i would ever see you again			0
" @entity0 's intervention was a reminder that for all his talk of history ultimately only crediting winners , he may be remembered as much for how he fought for his beliefs as what he achieved			0
few people know @entity0 as well as @entity218 , who endured another tongue lashing from his old sparring partner in november			0
" i believe in @entity0 's adage that a fight not joined is a fight not enjoyed , " @entity218 said .			0
