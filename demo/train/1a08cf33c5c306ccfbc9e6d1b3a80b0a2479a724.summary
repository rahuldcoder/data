-- @entity1 woke up on tuesday to horrifying news : four men , three of them in their 50s , had been slain while they were chanting their morning prayers at a synagogue in the @entity8 neighborhood of @entity9			1
the perpetrators were two young @entity11 men from @entity12 , who attacked with butcher knives and guns			2
the extensive media coverage included gruesome images of a synagogue chapel with blood splattered on the walls , pooled and streaked on the floor			0
and sprawled on those blood - pooled floors were the corpses of gray - haired men covered in their blood - stained prayer shawls , the leather straps of their phylacteries still wound around their lifeless arms			1
several public figures , from prominent politicians and commentators to the founder of a volunteer rescue service , said the images reminded them of the @entity35			0
the subtext seemed to be that murder was bad enough , but murdering people at prayer was an act of unprecedented barbarity			1
unfortunately , though , tuesday 's horror was not unprecedented			1
political violence is a grim fact of life in this part of the world , and it is committed by both jews and @entity49			0
in 1994 , for example , a @entity51 @entity1 man named @entity52 entered a @entity55 mosque armed with a machine gun			0
he opened fire on a room full of men at prayer , killing 29 of them			0
in recent months and years , @entity51 settlers have vandalized several mosques by setting them alight or tagging them with nationalist slogans in spray paint			0
@entity8 has been simmering since june , with one act of horrific political violence followed by another			1
first three @entity51 teenage boys were abducted and killed by @entity55 - area men affiliated with @entity71			1
then three @entity1 jews were charged with abducting a teenage @entity11 boy from @entity12 and killing him by burning him alive in a nearby forest			0
in response , there were @entity11 street protests , which @entity1 paramilitary police answered with tear gas , rubber - coated bullets , beatings and predawn arrests			1
then came a series of so - called " lone wolf " attacks , committed by individual @entity11 who attacked random @entity1 by stabbing them or ramming them with vehicles in deliberate hit - and - runs			1
for weeks , friends who live in neighborhoods abutting @entity12 , a primarily @entity11 area , have reported via social media that the sound of gunfire has become a nocturnal experience			0
one of the many depressing aspects of the endless @entity51 - @entity11 conflict is the rush to engage in moral one - upmanship			1
while it is absolutely undeniable that only one party in this conflict has a powerful army and heavy - hitting diplomatic allies ( that would be @entity1 ) , neither side has superior morality or redder blood			2
yes , there is context to the violence			0
but no , it is not the @entity35 , and we must resist the populist politicians and commentators who frame the latest deaths as having been committed in the name of hatred of @entity51 , rather than as an outrageous act of politically motivated violence			0
of course , the fact that this attack has both context and precedent does not make it any less horrifying			2
but those who ignore the context of this violence are also denying an essential element of this : that @entity11 in @entity12 are in a state of despair and hopelessness as a result of @entity1 's policies			2
the reality is that if the @entity1 government fails to address legitimate @entity11 grievances while portraying them simply as monsters rather than human beings , the situation in the world 's most contested city will continue to deteriorate .			2
