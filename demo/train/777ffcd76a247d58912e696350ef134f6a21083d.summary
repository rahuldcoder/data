@entity0 -- the looting of a large collection of priceless coins , statues and jewelry from a bank vault during @entity9 's recent civil war has highlighted the risk of looting during times of conflict			1
@entity14 is hunting for the hoard of @entity17 and @entity18 objects -- dubbed the " @entity19 " -- stolen from the city 's @entity20 in may 2011			1
but the theft is not an isolated incident			1
according to @entity24 's assistant director - general for culture @entity25 , the looting of antiquities and archaeological sites occurs regularly during times of conflict and even during peacetime			1
it is a problem that the @entity34 agency is constantly battling			1
" in the present moment it is difficult for us to do much because the situation is still very precarious , there is no administration in place in [ @entity9 ] , there are difficulties in communicating , " said @entity25			0
@entity25 's main fear is that the " @entity47 " will be dispersed or , worse , in the case of the coins , melted down and sold			1
the thieves reportedly drilled through the concrete ceiling of the bank vault to reach the coins and took only the most valuable items			2
" it looks targeted and well - planned , they knew what they were doing , " said dr. @entity53 , a @entity54 - born archaeologist and research fellow at @entity56 , @entity0			0
few records of the treasure survive , making it even more difficult to locate , though experts believe the collection contained ancient coins excavated from @entity9 in @entity9 , as well as statues and some jewelry dating from later periods			2
rumors that artifacts from the collection have surfaced in @entity72 and in @entity73 are unconfirmed , and the race to find the treasure is ongoing			2
so what can be done to prevent such thefts occurring in future and how to retrieve stolen items ? " we have very different outcomes with these things , " admitted @entity25			0
" the recovery of objects stolen from the museum in @entity86 [ during the @entity88 - led invasion in 2003 ] was relatively successful , most of the things were returned but this one is high risk , " he said			2
authorities have some tools at their disposal : the 1970 convention on the @entity97 and preventing the @entity98 , and the 1954 convention for the @entity100			0
in the case of @entity9 , precise co-ordinates for major sites of archaeological interest were given to @entity105 so that they could avoid them during bombing raids			0
but it is the theft of antiquities and their eventual sale that worries @entity25 most			1
" it remains the fourth or fifth biggest criminal industry in the world , " he said of the illegal trade , adding that countries with volatile governments tend to be most at risk			1
@entity119 is head of @entity121 mission " @entity122 for @entity54 studies , " which promotes and co-ordinates the activities of scholars working on the archaeology , history , linguistics and natural history of @entity9			0
" it is certain that there are organized bands of antiquities thieves going across the border into @entity72 , " he said , citing reports of grave robbing in sites in @entity9			2
" the problem is on the border [ with @entity72 ] , it 's become very porous			2
we need to see far more collaboration going on between the border patrols to stop the illicit trade in antiquities , " he said			1
" we do have to mobilize the @entity72 because clearly , the treasure has gone through @entity72 , as that is the closest border , " said @entity25			0
" but even @entity72 is not in the best position to help right now , " he continued			0
awareness of the problem of cultural crimes is one of the biggest challenges @entity24 faces			1
" it 's considered less of a crime , for reasons i do n't understand , " agreed @entity25			0
he hopes @entity24 will one day be as successful in combating the trade as his colleagues at the @entity159 ( @entity159 )			0
" they are extremely effective , there is almost a mass consciousness about ( the protection of endangered animals ) and that 's not the case with us , " he said			0
but while the theft of the " @entity47 " signifies a devastating loss , @entity54 are credited with doing much to protect their treasures since the fighting erupted			1
" throughout the conflict , locals did an enormous amount to keep their heritage safe , standing guard at sites and museums , " said @entity119			0
" they put themselves at risk and if it had n't been for them , it would have been a lot worse , " he continued			0
as for the missing " @entity47 , " it remains for auction houses and customs offices around the world to be extra vigilant			1
@entity24 and @entity14 will do what they can to make the issue more visible , said @entity25			1
the task is now for @entity9 to create a strong cultural administration to keep its treasures safe .			0
