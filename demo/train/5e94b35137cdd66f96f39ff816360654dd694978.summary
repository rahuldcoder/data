-- @entity1 is n't @entity2			1
despite her iconic status as a " famous feminist " -- as one of the leaders of the ' 90s riot grrrl movement from her days in @entity8 -- she is also human			0
and when her body started failing her , she realized she could n't do it all , which is why she called a hiatus for her band @entity12 six years ago			2
it took a long time for @entity1 to get a correct diagnosis -- late - stage lyme disease , after being told alternately that she had crohn 's disease , @entity18 , lupus and degenerative arthritis -- and proper treatment , and until she knew what was going on , she did n't want to disclose it to the world			1
" i did n't want to do press and say i was sick ! " @entity1 said			1
" ' hey , everybody , i have to leave ; i 'm sick ! ' " now in remission , she 's back full force , with a new band ( the @entity30 ) , a new album ( " @entity34 , " out this week ) , a tour , a documentary ( " @entity37 , " out this fall ) , an archive at @entity33 and more			1
" is everyone like , ' shut this woman up ! ' ? " @entity1 said with a laugh at the thought of being overexposed after years of silence			1
" i wanted to archive my work to make sure it lasted longer than i did , " she said			0
" and i still have some struggles with my health			0
it 's always like , ' i do n't know if i 'll be able to show up at your thing			2
' ' i do n't know if i 'll be able to go to the premiere of the movie about me			0
@entity1 has been able to keep up with the rigors of her schedule			1
and for that , she said , " i 'm just so thankful , because i have stuff i want to do , you know ? i just want to enjoy my life ! and now i can move on and do whatever i want now			0
" part of @entity1 's recent overload of activity stems from her facing her own limitations , her legacy and her mortality , because there was a period of time where she was forced to consider the possibility that she might not be able to sing for a living anymore			1
the original riot grrrl on @entity70 , ' 90s revival some of the alternate careers she considered were interior design ( she took classes at @entity75 ) , visual art , scripting comedy and , strangely enough , writing country songs			2
but just because @entity79 did n't turn out to be necessary does n't mean @entity1 is abandoning all her new avenues			1
" i would love to make a bunch of country demos and write country songs for really great country singers , " @entity1 said , noting that she grew up listening to country music			1
she counts @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 and @entity90 among her favorites			0
" i 'm really annoyed by the wave of country music that 's just a list of stuff , " she said			1
" it almost sounds like @entity97 people writing country music , because it 's just a list of stuff : ' my pickup truck and my cowboy boots and my @entity103 's jeans and my girlfriend with the short shorts			1
' it 's so boring ! " her country songs , @entity1 said , would either be abstract or have " narratives that do something weird and interesting , " such as " @entity110 " and " in color , " two of the country songs she 's been studying			1
" if i ca n't sing them myself , there 's nothing better than writing songs for other people and watching them be performed , " she added			2
" it 's kind of more thrilling than doing it yourself			2
" although @entity1 drives her husband , @entity123 boy @entity122 , crazy " by listening to the country station in the car all the time , " as a joke they wrote an ironic country song together called " do n't f * * * with my truck			1
" " it 's the most offensively sexist song , " she laughed			0
" one of the verses is really sexist , and the verses are about different forms of violence			0
and it will be released by someone with a name like mine that is n't mine , under a fake name			0
" @entity1 and @entity122 have also collaborated on a television comedy series that they wrote called " @entity143 , " based on the alt - cabaret show by @entity145			1
the plot centers around a " bus driver in @entity148 who wants to move to @entity149 and become a huge star , and she gets in wacky hijinks , " she said			0
" it 's kind of how you imagine @entity154 is before you moved here , and then you move here , and you 're disillusioned			0
" @entity1 's mapped out the first three seasons and is working on the pilot with a production company			1
if the pilot is n't picked up , she plans to try to make it as a movie because , she said , she so strongly believes in the script and the character			0
do n't expect that movie , however , to have a stereotypical girl power moment			0
@entity1 suggested updating the @entity168 test , which groups films according to whether they have scenes featuring two or more women talking about something other than a man			1
" i feel like the real test should be whether or not two or more female characters who are singing into a hairbrush or a spoon with frosting on it , singing an @entity182 song such as ' @entity183 , ' " she said			0
" there should be a wooden spoon test , because those faux - feminist scenes are despicable ! it 's like those white - people - save - the - day movies , like what was that @entity192 movie ? ' @entity193 ' ? how many more of those do we need ? i ca n't believe this movie exists			2
" @entity1 is n't too concerned that a @entity2 movie does n't exist , either			2
" i do n't find her that redeeming , " she said			0
" i 'm not that interested in female superheroes			0
" @entity1 does have a suggestion in lieu of the @entity203 for @entity204 to take on : " @entity205 , " her favorite cyberpunk superhero			2
" and the more action movies that have strong females , the better			0
