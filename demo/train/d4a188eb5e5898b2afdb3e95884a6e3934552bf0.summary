@entity0 , the embattled startup that captured shows from the broadcast airwaves and let users stream them digitally to their computers , smartphones or tablets , is essentially dead after a @entity9 ruling wednesday			1
the court , in a 6 - 3 vote , ruled that the service violated copyright laws , even though it was using miniature tv antennas to access publicly broadcast signals from local tv stations			1
the startup has said there was " no @entity21 " for its survival if the court ruled against them			1
the owners of @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 and other broadcasters had filed suit against @entity0			1
( @entity29 , the parent company of @entity30 , was not a plaintiff in the case , but did support the broadcasters			0
) @entity0 started in the @entity34 metropolitan area and is now online in @entity34 and 10 other @entity36 markets			1
it charges $ 8 a month and has never revealed how many users it has			2
so , now , the question becomes : what will @entity0 's users do instead ? presuming that @entity0 does , in fact , cease service as it now exists , there are other options out there for folks still unwilling to fork over the money for cable tv			1
from apps to web - streaming hardware , products exist with which millions have already " cut the cord			2
" but , as with much of life , there are upsides and downsides to this approach			0
here 's a look at what 's out there , what people like about it and what cable still has that the @entity65 ca n't duplicate			2
streaming hardware in the past few years , the market has been flooded with devices that can stream web content to your television			2
startups with dedicated devices , like @entity74 , soon were joined by some of tech 's major players			0
@entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 and @entity81 all have streaming devices with varying capabilities , and all the major video game consoles can be used to do so as well			2
once a techie luxury , devices like @entity79 's @entity86 or a low - end @entity74 can now be had for as little as $ 35 - 40			0
that 's come in handy for folks looking for alternatives to traditional television because ... apps are everywhere ask people who do n't have cable or a satellite dish what they use to watch television and a short list of apps are mentioned again and again : @entity100 , @entity101 and @entity102			2
streaming accounts for each offer tv shows and movies			1
@entity101 focuses on new tv episodes ( or , at least , newer ... more on that later ) while @entity80 and @entity100 are mostly movies and previous seasons of popular shows			2
for some , that 's enough to substitute for the full array that cable offers			2
especially when paired with ... rabbit ears ! ok , so maybe the antenna you 'd go out and buy today would n't bear much of a resemblance to the twin - pronged , set - top gadgetry many of us remember from our childhoods ( tinfoil wrapped round the tips optional )			0
but with a digital antenna , you get the major networks ( @entity23 , @entity126 , @entity25 and @entity24 ) , @entity127 and other local stations in a lot better quality than you used to get			1
put that together with the streaming options and you 're starting to build yourself back up			1
however ... the drawbacks despite all the digital options , there are some things that you just ca n't replace when you pull the plug on cable			1
if you fall back on watching only broadcast networks , for example , your picture quality may suffer			1
also , none of the above - mentioned apps stream tv shows as they are airing			0
on @entity101 , many shows are n't available until 24 hours after they air			0
in the age of plot spoilers online and on social media , that 's risky			0
@entity24 and @entity23 have chosen to wait eight days before letting non-subscribers watch new shows			0
it 's even tougher to keep up with your premium cable favorites			0
@entity156 made news in april by announcing it would make some old shows like " @entity159 " and " @entity160 " available on @entity80			0
but a three - year delay means " girls " or " @entity163 " fans are still out of luck			0
as are those fans hoping to watch ... the big game ask non-cable subscribers about the holes in their new tv setup and many bring up live sports			0
while many cable networks stream via their websites and mobile apps , most , like @entity174 , require a cable subscription to access them			1
if you enjoy hitting your local sports bar , this may not be such a big deal			0
if you 're more inclined to kick back and watch sports at home ( particularly if you follow a team outside the city where you live ) it 's tough			0
in the end , the cable - vs. - digital debate appears set to continue for a while , much like many other situations in which emerging technology has collided awkwardly with entrenched institutions			1
but , for better or for worse , the @entity9 on wednesday did n't help the digital side 's cause .			1

the @entity36 @entity9 ruled against streaming startup @entity0
@entity0 used *micro-antennae* to pick up broadcast networks for users
some are turning to digital options instead of cable
new shows , live events are still *tricky* to get
