-- @entity2 representatives and lawmakers from alliance nations will meet in @entity5 thursday to discuss security challenges that are likely to arise as the @entity8 thaws			1
global warming is opening up more parts of the @entity8 to development and raising security concerns			1
the area -- one of the planet 's most fragile and pristine ecosystems -- sits atop a bounty of untapped fossil fuels			1
and as the melting polar ice makes the @entity8 more accessible to ships , several countries are scrambling to claim jurisdiction in the area			1
" the economic interests are reflected in ... competing claims by relevant stakeholders , and resumed military presence in the area , " @entity2 said on its web site			2
" as it is a region of enduring strategic importance for @entity2 and allied security , developments in the @entity31 require careful and ongoing examination			1
" the @entity36 estimates that 90 billion barrels of oil , 44 billion barrels of natural gas liquids and 1,670 trillion cubic feet of natural gas are recoverable in the frozen region north of the @entity8			1
at the same time , @entity8 water is warming so quickly that the entire region could be ice - free by 2013			2
already @entity45 , @entity46 , the @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity5 and @entity51 are fighting to lay claim to the @entity8 's icy real estate			1
unlike @entity55 , which has a treaty that prohibits territorial claims , there is no agreement for the vast expanse of the @entity8			2
so questions about drilling rights and shipping lanes are somewhat murky			0
according to the @entity64 , countries are entitled to exclusive economic zones up to 200 miles from their shores			0
but some countries are trying to extend that zone			0
@entity45 scientists want to prove the seabed below the @entity71 is part of the @entity74 continental shelf , an area called the @entity76			0
if that is the case , the region would be under @entity45 control			0
@entity80 argued before a @entity64 commission in 2001 that the ridge is an extension of its continental territory			0
but the @entity85 asked for more evidence			0
@entity48 scientists are trying to prove that the @entity76 is connected to @entity88 , and @entity46 scientists are looking for links between the ridge and @entity92 , a @entity46 territory			0
@entity2 secretary general @entity93 will attend the two - day conference in @entity95 .			2
