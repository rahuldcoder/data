-- year after year @entity1 ask : when will our economy get better ? injecting more capital into the economy should work -- in theory -- because capital fuels capitalism			1
yet this capital sits unused on the balance sheets of corporations , and languishes inert in private equity funds			1
@entity12 2013 : follow the action live on @entity0 capitalists seem uninterested in capitalism , even as eager entrepreneurs ca n't get financing			0
businesses and investors sound like the @entity20 , who complained , " water , water everywhere -- nor any drop to drink			1
" at the heart of this paradox is a doctrine of finance employing measures of profitability that guide capitalists away from investments that can create growth			0
@entity12 2013 : new year , same old problems ? there are three types of innovations			0
the first are " empowering " innovations			0
these transform complicated , costly products that previously had been available only to a few people , into simpler , cheaper products available to many			0
the @entity43 was an empowering innovation , as was the @entity46 transistor radio			0
empowering innovations create jobs for people who build , distribute , sell and service these products			1
the second type are " sustaining " innovations			0
these replace old products with new			0
the @entity56 hybrid is marvelous -- yet every time a customer buys a @entity56 , a camry is not sold			0
sustaining innovations replace yesterday 's products with today 's products			1
they keep our economy vibrant -- and , in dollars , they account for the most innovation			0
but they have a zero - sum effect on jobs and capital			1
@entity71 : why @entity73 's transition from its @entity74 is so painful the third type are " efficiency " innovations			1
these reduce the cost of making and distributing existing products and services - like @entity56 's just - in - time manufacturing in carmaking and @entity83 in online insurance underwriting			1
efficiency innovations almost always reduce the net number of jobs in an industry , allow the same amount of work ( or more ) to get done using fewer people			2
efficiency innovations also emancipate capital for other uses			2
without them , much of an economy 's capital is held captive on balance sheets , tied up in inventory , working capital , and balance sheet reserves			1
quest : @entity1 economy to dominate @entity12 2013 industries typically transition through these types of innovations			1
the early @entity108 mainframe computers were so expensive that only big companies could own them			0
but pcs were an empowering innovation that allowed many more people to own computers			0
companies like @entity116 had to hire thousands of people to make and sell @entity118 they then deployed workers to make better computers — sustaining innovations			0
finally , the industry began to outsource its operations , becoming much more capital efficient			2
this reduced net employment within the industry , but freed capital that had been used in the supply chain			2
the dials on these three innovations are sensitive , but if set in a recurring circle -- with empowering innovations creating more jobs than efficiency innovations eliminate , and the capital that efficiency innovations liberate being invested back into empowering innovations -- the economy is a magnificent machine			1
the belt of circularity in @entity1 's economic engine , however , is broken			1
the 1982 recovery took the economy 's usual 6 months to reach the prerecession peaks of performance			2
getting back to the prior peak in the 1990 recession took 15 months			0
our economic machine has been grinding for 65 months trying to hit prerecession levels — and it 's not clear whether or how we 're going to get there			2
the reason ? in @entity1 , @entity156 and @entity157 , the dials have gone amok			1
efficiency innovations are liberating capital , but that capital is being reinvested into still more efficiency innovations			2
our economies are generating many fewer empowering innovations than in the past			0
@entity1 thinker @entity165 brings a useful perspective to this puzzle			1
he teaches that we should be frugal with resources that are scarce and costly , but can waste resources that are abundant and cheap			1
when the @entity171 emerged between the 1930s and 1950s , capital was scarce			1
we therefore focused on magnifying every dollar put into a company , to maximize revenue and profit per dollar of capital deployed			2
executives came to use measures of efficiency that focused on the short term , investing in quick wins in sustaining and efficiency innovations instead of funding empowering innovations that pay off in five years , or often even longer			2
read more : all you need to know to be a @entity12 delegate the paradox explored in my book @entity188 is that successful companies can fail by making the " right " decisions in the wrong situations			0
we are in the capitalist 's dilemma today			1
investors continue applying doctrines that were appropriate when capital was scarce			1
but because today capital is abundant and the cost of capital today is essentially zero , the same rules are the wrong rules			2
it 's as if our leaders in @entity204 are standing on a beach holding fire hoses full open , pouring more capital into an ocean of capital			1
we truly are awash in cheap capital -- which means that returns on long - term investments in empowering innovations will yield the same returns as short - term ones			2
is there a solution ? it 's complicated , but i offer three ideas for discussion : change the metrics we can use capital with abandon now , because it 's abundant and cheap			1
but we can no longer waste education , subsidizing fields that offer few jobs			1
optimizing return on capital will generate less growth than optimizing return on education			1
change the politics both parties are wrong on taxing and distributing the capital of the wealthiest 1 %			2
the @entity236 are wrong in thinking that the rich create jobs			0
in reality many of the richest @entity1 have been investing in efficiency innovations rather than to create jobs			1
and the @entity241 are wrong , because growth wo n't happen if they distribute the wealth of the wealthy to everyone else			0
money will be spent buying sustaining innovations — replacing consumption with consumption , because there are few empowering products to buy			0
change tax rates on capital gains we should make capital gains regressive over time , based upon how long the capital is invested			0
taxes on short - term investments should continue to be taxed at personal income rates			0
but the rate should be reduced the longer the investment is held — so that , for example , tax rates on investments held for five years might be zero — and rates on investments held for eight years might be negative			0
we must give the wealthiest an incentive to invest for the long term			0
 we face complicated problems , and mine is a simple model			0
but i hope it helps us understand that policies that were once right are now wrong , and that counterintuitive measures might actually work to turn our economies around			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity281 .			1

@entity283 professor @entity281 says we are now living in the capitalist 's dilemma
investors continue applying doctrines that were appropriate when capital was scarce
@entity281 says @entity1 can no longer waste education , subsidizing fields that offer few jobs
