@entity0 , @entity1 -- each day after work , @entity3 takes her two daughters to feed their horses			1
it 's their favorite part of the day -- a time they do n't think about pain			2
" it 's really difficult for my mom to have two daughters with cancer , " said 16 - year - old @entity10 , the older daughter			1
" because sometimes she 's got two of us in the hospital at the same time , and we both get sick at the same time			2
and sometimes she does n't have anyone to help her , and it really affects her			0
" the @entity21 live on @entity0 , an @entity23 island off @entity1			1
for nearly 60 years , the @entity23 military used much of the island as a bombing range , dropping vast quantities of live bombs and missiles in weapons tests			1
now , about three - quarters of the island 's residents -- including @entity10 and her 14 - year - old sister @entity32 -- are part of a lawsuit that claims the bombing range made them sick			1
" there 's a lot of people here dying of cancer , " @entity10 said			1
" i have my little cousin dying of cancer			2
i have my sister that has cancer			2
my boyfriend 's mom died of cancer			1
his dad has cancer of the skin			2
a lot of people are suffering here of cancer , ' cause what they did here in @entity0			1
" as a toddler , @entity10 was diagnosed with neuroblastoma , a cancer that afflicts younger children			2
her mother says much of @entity10 's stomach and intestines had to be replaced as a result of the cancer			1
" almost everything is plastic , " @entity3 said			1
" so when she eats certain foods , it produces diarrhea , which has caused dehydration			2
she gets sick a lot , and certain foods she can not eat like regular people			0
" the operations have left @entity10 with a six - inch gash across her stomach , along with emotional scars			0
" sometimes i feel sad , ' cause everybody calls me ' plastic intestines , ' " she said			0
" they say , ' oh , you have a plastic belly			0
' and i tell them , ' you know what ? if you were in this condition , how would you feel ? ' " and doctors found a large tumor in @entity32 's mouth when she was 7			2
" it was very swollen , and it looked like there was a big ball of gum in my mouth or a big lollipop , " she said			0
" i started having pain , and the only thing that would come out was blood			0
" @entity32 was diagnosed with @entity97 's sarcoma , a bone cancer			1
@entity99 , who represents coral , @entity100 and other islanders in the lawsuit against the federal government , told @entity2 , " there is suffering throughout this island			1
" " you can not walk down the street on this island without counting every house and knowing two or three people on the street that have cancer , or have had cancer , or have died from cancer , " @entity99 said			1
" but for me , the most disturbing thing is the number of children on this island that have terminal cancer			1
" @entity99 , of @entity119 , has taken more than 1,300 hair samples from @entity0 residents and had them tested for heavy metals			1
about 80 percent of the hair samples tested positive for heavy metals			0
many of the results show levels of toxic elements in people that are literally off the charts -- the lines representing substances like lead , mercury , arsenic , aluminum and cadmium extend beyond the " dangerous " area and out of the grid entirely			0
" these hair samples , i believe , are the strongest proof that the contaminants -- the things that were in the bombs , like the lead , mercury , cadmium , arsenic , aluminum -- are now in the people , " @entity99 said			2
behind one of those charts is 7 - year - old @entity150 , whose hair was tested when she was 2			0
@entity150 's parents say she had been very sick , and they fear she may get sick again			2
" " she looked like she had chemotherapy			0
she lost all her hair , and she had these spots on her legs , " her father told @entity2			0
" she also had bad trouble using her fingers properly for a long time			0
" @entity99 said he was not surprised to learn of the problems @entity150 has experienced			0
" unfortunately , we have seen many children on @entity0 with similar problems , " he said			1
" and she may still get sick again			0
we do n't know if she will get cancer later			2
" dr. @entity168 , a @entity169 - trained epidemiologist , has studied the @entity0 population for years			1
she and other scientists have been deposed in the lawsuit			0
" the human population of @entity0 is by far the sickest human population that i 've ever worked with , " said @entity173 , who practices in @entity174			1
" these people are very sick very early , and dying earlier			0
so something is happening there			0
" @entity173 has compiled statistics for the @entity0 population that she and other scientists find alarming			1
" it 's astonishing , " she said			0
" they die 30 percent higher of cancer , 45 percent higher of diabetes , 95 percent higher of liver disease , and 381 percent higher of hypertension than the rest of @entity1			0
" @entity173 ' findings are supported by and are now used by the @entity1 @entity189 as an indicator of health problems for the people of @entity0			1
she also found disturbing statistics on mercury levels in the @entity0 population -- levels that are much higher than the rest of @entity1			1
" twenty - seven percent of the women in @entity0 have enough mercury to damage their baby 's brain			1
" this is very serious , given that mercury causes permanent damage and mental retardation in children and that the hair samples are a standard way of measuring this exposure in women in the reproductive age			0
" she said her sampling of children 5 and under in @entity0 had " at least six times higher levels of mercury exposure than children sampled in the @entity23			1
" read comments on the high rate of illness on @entity0 dr. @entity224 , a @entity225 expert on the effects of toxic exposure on human health , said he believes contamination from the bombing range has caused illnesses among @entity0 residents			1
" the chemicals released on the island have the capacity to induce cancer , to damage the nervous system , to cause reproductive damage , mutations , genetic damage , and also to harm the immune system , " said @entity224 , who is slated to testify as an expert witness in the islanders ' lawsuit			1
in 2003 , scientists from the @entity246 concluded there was no link between the @entity23 military activity on @entity0 and the health problems suffered by the island 's population			1
the scientists were from the @entity246 's @entity256 ( @entity255 ) division , which studies the nation 's toxic superfund sites			0
numerous scientists and federal lawmakers have since publicly criticized the 2003 report on @entity0			2
@entity262 , director of the @entity255 , was grilled at a @entity264 science and technology subcommittee hearing last year over the effectiveness of the agency and its handling of the @entity0 and other questionable sites			2
in a report released just two days before the march 12 hearing , the subcommittee found that " time and time again @entity255 appears to avoid clearly and directly confronting the most obvious toxic culprits that harm the health of local communities throughout the nation			0
" instead , they deny , delay , minimize , trivialize or ignore legitimate concerns and health considerations of local communities and well - respected scientists and medical professionals			0
" and in november , a group of at least seven scientists , including @entity173 and @entity224 , called on @entity255 to conduct more research on the @entity0			2
@entity255 later that month announced it would take a " fresh look " at @entity0 and conduct new studies to determine whether the @entity288 's contamination at @entity0 made people sick			1
in january , @entity255 's @entity262 was reassigned			0
in response to the islander 's lawsuit , the @entity23 government is invoking sovereign immunity , claiming the islanders do not have the right to sue the government and that there 's no proof that the @entity288 's activities caused the widespread illnesses			1
for the sick residents of @entity0 there is no time to lose			2
" what i want is people to get medicine and help here , " said @entity32			0
" i know how people are suffering in this island			0
i see people in the streets and poor people living like wild things			0
and there 's kids dying on the street			0

@entity0 resident @entity3 's two *teenage* daughters both suffer from cancer
a lawsuit blames *fallout* from @entity23 weapons tests on the island for the high rate of illness
@entity23 government says there 's no proof that @entity288 activity caused widespread illness
watch the full *investigation* tonight on " @entity337 " at 8 et
