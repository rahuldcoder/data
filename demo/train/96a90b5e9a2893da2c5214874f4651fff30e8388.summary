-- @entity2 's black - hole hunting telescope has captured a cosmic battle between dark and light			1
@entity6 , formally known as the @entity6 , has observed a supermassive black hole 's gravity tugging on x-ray light that 's being emitted near that black hole			1
that light is getting stretched and blurred , and researchers are getting to see it all in unprecedented detail , said @entity2 in a news release issued today			0
in this instance , the corona -- a source of x-ray light that sits near a black hole -- recently collapsed in toward the black hole that 's named @entity20 335			1
the @entity6 telescope has been collecting x-rays from black holes and dying stars for the past two years			2
the craft completed its primary mission earlier this year , and it was redirected to investigate @entity20 once scientists noticed that the black hole had become dramatically brighter			2
@entity6 observed that @entity30 's gravity sucked the corona 's light , an illuminating action that @entity2 likened to someone shining a flashlight for astronomers			0
scientists can now see the corona " lighting up material around the black hole , " which allows them to study " the most extreme light - bending effects " of @entity42 's theory of general relativity , said @entity6 's principal investigator , @entity45 , in the news release			1

as if @entity6 's observations and @entity42 's theories are n't mind - boggling enough , @entity2 says the black hole @entity20 335 " spins so rapidly that space and time are dragged around with it			1
" the space agency says the new observations could help scientists better understand mysterious coronas and black holes , which are thought to be formed when massive stars collapse , creating such density that not even light can escape their intense gravitational pull			0
scientists believe supermassive black holes reside in the centers of galaxies			0
some are more massive and rotate faster than others .			0

@entity2 's @entity6 searches the galaxy looking for black holes
the black hole known as @entity20 is capturing and bending nearby x-ray light
the event is *literally* *shedding* light on how @entity42 's theory of relativity works in extremes
