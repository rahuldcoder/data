@entity7 , a craft developed by the company @entity9 , was concluding a brief but possibly historic flight for the infant commercial space travel industry			1
the vehicle hit the water shortly after 2 p.m. et , a little more than three hours after liftoff from the @entity15 in @entity16 , @entity17 atop a @entity19 rocket			1
before splashing down , the @entity7 orbited earth at more than 17,000 mph			0
only six nations or government agencies have recovered a spacecraft from a low orbit : the @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 and the @entity30			0
wednesday 's landing was also the first flight under @entity35 's @entity34 program			1

@entity35 administrator @entity39 praised the mission			1
" these new explorers are to spaceflight what @entity42 was to commercial aviation , " he said wednesday			0
" while rocket launches from the @entity16 are considered a common occurrence , the historic significance of today 's achievement by @entity9 should not be lost			1
" @entity49 said the mission reflected a new generation of commercial launch systems that would support the international space station and that could eventually carry astronauts into orbit			0
it also coincides with the scaling back of some publicly funded space programs			0
@entity35 is set to retire its shuttle fleet in 2011			1
president @entity61 's administration would like to see whether private companies can do the fleet 's job cheaper and more efficiently			2

in july , a test launch of the @entity19 rocket was " essentially a bulls - eye , " @entity9 officials said after the rocket successfully pushed past @entity3 's atmosphere and deposited a mock - up of its @entity7 space capsule in orbit			1
@entity35 has been flying shuttles in low @entity3 orbit for nearly 30 years and going to and from the space station for more than a decade			1
@entity35 has selected @entity9 and another company , @entity88 , to each develop an orbital vehicle that could be used when the @entity25 no longer has its own way to get to the space station			1
in the meantime , the @entity25 will be renting space from the @entity26 aboard their @entity95 spacecraft			0
@entity9 is the first company to reach the launch pad			2
by this summer , it had spent almost $ 400 million to get there			0
@entity9 currently holds a $ 1.6 billion contract from @entity35 to transport cargo , but not people , into space			1
@entity9 ceo @entity104 , co-founder of @entity105 , said in july that if all goes well after a series of test flights , @entity9 will be ready to begin flying cargo to the space station next year			1
@entity104 says it could begin ferrying astronauts to the space station within three years			0
" we want to see a future where we are exploring the stars , where we 're going to other planets , where we 're doing the great things that we read about in science fiction and in the movies , " he said in july			0
other entrepreneurs in the emerging commercial space travel business say flights will no longer be confined to astronauts			0
@entity125 , a commercial launch facility in @entity127 , @entity128 , is expected to be fully operational by the end of 2011			0
the company 's main tenant , @entity132 , hopes to launch short tourist excursions into space in the near future			2

@entity35 official cites " historic significance of today 's achievement by @entity9 "
