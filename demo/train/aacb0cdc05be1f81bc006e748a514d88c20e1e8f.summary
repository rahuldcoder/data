some 50 million @entity0 still lack health insurance			1
that will change for the greater majority when the @entity5 , or @entity5 , as it 's more commonly known , rolls out over the next couple of years			0
while the bulk of the law goes into place in 2014 , you 'll see a few changes this year			0
however , much of 2013 will be dedicated to health facilities and government offices getting ready for the larger changes coming down the road			1
on thursday , the @entity16 conditionally approved eight more states ' plans to set up their own health insurance exchange programs			1
the conditional approvals mean a total of 19 states plus the @entity23 have the initial thumbs - up on their plans			2
two others , @entity27 and @entity28 , have the go - ahead to run an exchange in partnership with the federal government			2
decision day for states on health insurance marketplaces states can decide to set up an exchange at any time , but the clock is ticking			1
states that plan to partner with the federal government need to do so by february 15			2
people not living in a state with an exchange have access to a federal program			2
all the exchanges are supposed to be up and running by october 1 of this year			1
in a conference call with reporters thursday , @entity16 secretary @entity51 said she was encouraged by the progress states have made so far			2
" from the beginning , this process has been guided by our belief that states know their own needs better than anyone else , " @entity51 said			2
" that 's why we have worked so hard to give states the flexibility and resources to create and participate in marketplaces that work best for their citizens , and it 's encouraging to see so many states moving forward to do just that			2
" what these exchanges will do is give the uninsured a better chance to shop for insurance in a way that 's supposed to take the mystery out of buying a plan			1
think of it like an online travel site that pulls information from hundreds of companies , allowing customers to compare the costs of flights or hotels on one easy - to - read screen			0
another advantage to the exchange may be a lower cost for health insurance , according to @entity92			1
he is the former director of the @entity94 and @entity95 at @entity16 , the office responsible for implementing @entity5			0
" the key issue is not if the state or the fed runs the exchange , " @entity92 said			0
" the key is : will it be a strong or weak exchange , and will it use the bargaining power that it has to standardize the benefit packages and establish a real competitive bidding process that can really drive down rates ? " if the exchanges allow insurance companies to sell whatever they want , if ( the state ) does n't negotiate or establish competitive bidding process , it 's another case , " he said			1
obamacare to flesh - eating bacteria : top 2012 health stories here are some other parts of @entity5 taking effect in 2013 : preventative services the federal government is sending more money to state medicaid programs that offer preventative services for free or at little cost			1
services include tests for high blood pressure , diabetes , and high cholesterol ; many cancer screenings including colonoscopies and mammograms ; counseling to help people lose weight , quit smoking or reduce alcohol use ; routine vaccinations ; flu and pneumonia shots ; and others			1
increased @entity141 payments doctors that take @entity141 patients get a pay raise			0
starting january 1 , @entity141 payments in every state were brought up to the same level @entity149 pays doctors			0
some experts say the @entity149 rate is too low , but @entity141 paid even less			0
while it varies from state to state , primary care physicians see on average a 73 % pay bump according to the @entity158			0
a pilot program for bundling services the law sets up a national pilot program that will encourage medical providers to coordinate patient care			1
rather than have each service billed separately under @entity149 , a flat rate would be paid for an episode of care			0
justices wo n't block @entity5 's required emergency contraception coverage @entity149 tax increase the wealthy face a 0.9 % tax increase on the income they earn in excess of $ 200,000 ( for couples filing jointly , it will hit those that make in excess of $ 250,000 )			0
this will help boost the @entity149 trust fund			0
medical device tax a new 2.3 % tax goes on the price of medical devices			0
this does n't include hearing aids or corrective lenses , but does include devices like defibrillators , pacemakers , artificial joints and others			0
medical deductions up until now , @entity0 got a tax deduction if all their total medical expenses added up to more than 7.5 % of what they earn ( minus deductions and exceptions )			1
those expenses now will have to add up to 10 % or more for most tax filers			0
cap on @entity203 @entity204 now have a cap			1
up until now , employers set the limit on how much employees could set aside from their paychecks tax free to pay for medical expenses not covered by their insurance			1
the majority of companies set an @entity203 limit of around $ 5,000			1
the government is now limiting @entity203 's to $ 2,500			1
health benefits spelled out @entity218 tax forms issued this year for wages paid in 2012 must now include a line on the form showing the benefit employees receive from their employer - sponsored health care			2
this is supposed to help you understand your benefits better and make health care spending more transparent .			0

all the exchanges should be up and running by october 1
