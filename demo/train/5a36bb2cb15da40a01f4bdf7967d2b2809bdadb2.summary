-- for nine seasons , @entity1 delighted audiences worldwide as the eccentric but lovable @entity4 on @entity6 's " @entity5			1
" @entity1 's performance earned him a place in @entity10 pop culture history			1
but in his work off screen , @entity1 is building an entirely different legacy			1
" when i started getting well known as an actor on ' @entity5 , ' i got inundated by requests to be a spokesperson for various charities			1
and i had an opportunity , i thought , for me to explore what was most important to me in my heart , and what i felt could make the greatest impact in the world , " @entity1 says			2
@entity1 then found the perfect match			2
the @entity25 , based in @entity1 's hometown of @entity27 , supports grass - roots educational organizations both internationally and in the @entity10			1
" they support about 20 different schools and educational initiatives in about 15 different countries , and the more i learned about them , the more i loved			0
they target women and girls , and that 's how you transform a community , " says @entity1			1
a major difference from other organizations , @entity1 points out , is that the @entity25 finds programs that already exist and are working but underfunded			1
it is then able to bring in the support to improve the program and build a foundation for long - term success			0
@entity1 says this ensures that the community will get what it really needs and can sustain			2
it empowers members of the community to take control and move in a positive direction			0
working with the @entity25 is a family affair for @entity1			1
it 's a project to which he and his wife , @entity59 , are both fully committed			0
they visit the schools under the @entity25 umbrella frequently and sometimes bring along their son			1
@entity1 and @entity59 have visited the @entity25 schools in @entity65 a handful of times -- both before and after the devastating earthquake in 2010			1
" one of the things my wife and i do together is we teach arts workshops for adolescent girls			2
they 're the most at - risk population in @entity65 and through most of the developing world : teenage girls , preteen girls			0
targeting them to empower them and educate them is really the most crucial thing			0
we do arts and leadership workshops with them , " @entity1 continues			2
" we 're sponsoring some girls and giving them scholarships to get jobs training and @entity90 training			0
@entity90 training is very important , because it leads to jobs			0
it 's not like a @entity94 egotism thing , like oh , you should learn to speak @entity10			2
it really is -- if you learn to speak fluent @entity90 , you can get a job as a translator or in a hotel or a restaurant or for an @entity101 or for any number of different places			0
it 's actually a very important skill set to have			0
so , i love weaving the arts in with leadership , helping give these girls a voice			0
