@entity0 -- @entity3 @entity2 unveiled their revised version of health care reform tuesday , offering a proposal that includes a government - funded health insurance option , requires both individuals and employers to participate , and taxes the wealthy to help cover costs			1
president @entity12 has urged @entity13 to work quickly on creating a health care reform bill			1
@entity2 @entity3 leaders said the measure , titled " @entity16 , " met the requirements set by president @entity12 for health care reform by lowering costs to consumers and businesses , letting people keep their current plan if desired , and preventing denial of coverage due to pre-existing medical conditions			1
" the @entity3 proposal will begin the process of fixing what 's broken about our health care system , reducing costs for all , building on what works , and covering an estimated 97 percent of all @entity36 , " @entity12 said in a written statement			1
" and by emphasizing prevention and wellness , it will also help improve the quality of health care for every @entity36			1
" rep. @entity42 , @entity43 , said the bill is intended to repair a " dysfunctional " health care system that is draining the @entity36 economy while leaving 46 million @entity36 without health insurance			1
" we are going to accomplish what many people felt would n't happen in our lifetime , " he said			0
but @entity3 @entity52 slammed the @entity2 ' bill and pledged to try to amend it as three @entity3 committees begin considering the legislation later this week			1
rep. @entity57 , @entity58 , said the bill " without any question will kill jobs , will limit access to health care , will raise taxes and will lead to a government takeover of health care			1
" @entity57 said he will offer an amendment requiring all elected federal officials , including @entity12 and vice president @entity69 , to enroll in the new public insurance option			1
republicans and some fiscally conservative democrats also question the cost of health care reform			1
an earlier draft of the @entity3 @entity2 ' bill carried a price tag of $ 1 trillion over 10 years			0
the @entity77 said the revised house bill also would cost $ 1 trillion			0
however , a senior @entity2 @entity80 staffer said the @entity77 analysis only covered costs without factoring in cost - saving measures worth $ 500 billion over 10 years or the revenue from tax surcharges on wealthy @entity36 , estimated to raise more than $ 500 billion over a decade			1
according to the @entity77 , the bill would cover 97 percent of @entity36 by 2015			0
the bill includes tax surcharges on @entity36 in the top 1.2 percent of income			0
it proposes a 5.4 percent surtax on couples earning more than $ 1 million , a 1.5 percent surtax on couples with income between $ 500,000 and $ 1 million , and a 1 percent surtax on joint incomes over $ 350,000 or individual income over $ 280,000			0
anticipating @entity52 complaints that the tax surcharges would harm small business owners who report their income as personal , @entity2 sponsors said the measure would affect less than 5 percent of all small business owners			2
specific provisions of the bill include : -- a @entity107 providing individuals and small business with choices for coverage , including a government - funded public option			1
-- no more coverage exclusion for pre-existing conditions			0
-- affordability credits for low - and moderate - income individuals and families , available to those with incomes up to 400 percent of the federal poverty level , or $ 43,000 for individuals and $ 88,000 for a family of four			2
-- limits on annual out - of - pocket spending			2
-- expanded @entity127 coverage to individuals and families with incomes at or below 133 percent of the federal poverty level			0
-- required participation by individuals , with a penalty of 2.5 percent of adjusted gross income for non-compliance			0
-- requirement that businesses with payrolls exceeding $ 250,000 provide their employees with health coverage or contribute up to 8 percent of their payroll on their behalf			2
-- a series of measures intended to reduce costs of @entity127 , @entity147 and other existing systems			0
a statement tuesday from the @entity36 @entity150 and other business groups opposed some of the bill 's proposals , calling for market forces and employer autonomy instead of mandated participation by businesses			2
" exempting some micro-businesses will not prevent this provision from killing many jobs , " the statement said			0
the @entity3 bill now goes to three committees for debate and revision before consideration by the full chamber			0
the @entity169 also is considering health reform measures that contain some of the @entity3 bill provisions			2
@entity12 has said he wants both chambers to pass their respective proposals before @entity13 goes on its august recess as part of a timetable to get a final bill to his desk by the end of the year			2
@entity183 @entity182 of @entity184 argued that the current economic conditions mean @entity13 should take its time on a major overhaul of the health care system			1
" there 's no need for us to be rushing into passing legislation before the end of this month at the potential cost of , really , millions of jobs , " @entity182 said tuesday			0
a @entity196 survey released july 1 found that a slim majority -- 51 percent -- support @entity12 's health care plans , but most worry that their costs would go up , and only one in five think their families would be better off			1
