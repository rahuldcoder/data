-- no doubt about it , actor @entity1 is in a pretty great place in his career			1
he 's on one of the most popular scripted series on cable , " @entity9 , " and he 's one of the most popular characters on that series			1
on top of that , he is as close as one can get to being a romantic lead on a show about a zombie apocalypse			2
his character , @entity17 , is involved with farmer 's daughter @entity18 , and they have the most stable relationship of all of the survivors at this point			1
of course , stability -- not to mention life itself -- is a very fragile thing on " @entity9			1
" the third season , which began on sunday to record ratings , sees the group settling in what at first appeared to be in an abandoned prison			1
@entity1 spoke with @entity0 about the new season , the fans and what scares him more than zombies			1
@entity0 : where is @entity17 's head at this season ? @entity1 : he sees himself as , if not a leader , at least a provider and protector and someone to look to in times of trouble			1
you see @entity17 in this moment ready to take up the charge			1
it 's not easy , but these are the moments he 's been preparing for			2
we 'll see how that plays out			2
@entity0 : how devoted is he to @entity18 now , as opposed to the rest of the group ? @entity1 : i think @entity18 is his strongest link			1
she 's the sole thing he identifies with			2
i think she 's the only thing that keeps him from going off on his own			2
i do n't think he completely trusts the group			2
you saw in the last season , he questioned @entity64 , someone he 's always looked up to			2
@entity17 saw that the only thing he can really trust is his own gut , and he needs to do that to protect the people he loves			1
@entity18 is his sole connection to being in this world , even			2
@entity0 : what new challenges come with the change of setting ? @entity1 : it 's an adjustment to get used to being on stages , not outside all the time			1
luckily , our writers and producers make sure we had plenty of time in the battering heat			0
it was a challenge at first , but it 's fun to play how the situation changes how the character behaves			0
@entity0 : is there anything for @entity17 this season that tops that grotesque , harrowing scene in the well ? @entity1 : this season is literally no holds barred ; it 's gas pedal down			1
i 'm excited for people to see what 's coming			0
the well was an amazing thing			0
it was terrifying and fun			0
there 's definitely stuff this season that tops that by far			2
@entity0 : how does it feel to know about the season premiere 's record - breaking ratings ? @entity1 : it 's pretty damn amazing			1
it 's nice to know that people are anticipating it and telling their friends			0
it 's all around great			0
@entity0 : are you into horror movies ? @entity1 : i 'm not much of a horror fan			1
when it comes to ghost stuff and demon stuff , i ca n't watch that			0
i 've heard too many crazy stories about that stuff , so i do n't mess around that			0
especially when you 're staying in a haunted hotel			0
@entity0 : so zombies are no problem , but ghosts on the other hand ... @entity1 : zombies -- you can deal with that			1
you can punch or shoot them			0
with ghosts , you 're going to be possessed , or something 's going to be thrown at you			0
you ca n't do anything about that			0
no , thank you ! @entity0 : did you run into " @entity134 ' " @entity135 when he dressed up as @entity17 at @entity136 this year ? @entity1 : that 's pretty amazing that he did that			1
it 's amazing to see anyone do anything with that character			0
i 'm just lucky enough to be able to play it in a public forum			0
@entity0 : have you had any unusual " zombie " interactions outside of the show ? @entity1 : people are strange sometimes , which is completely hilarious to me			1
a really normal couple in @entity154 were walking down the street , and the girl recognized me and started walking towards me in a " walker " walk			0
and she was committed , like " uuuuhh , i love your showwww ... " that was unique			0
@entity0 : finally , i have to ask , do you ever try to get information out of " @entity9 " creator @entity164 about what 's going to happen on the show ? @entity1 : they 're pretty protective ( of that )			1
they hold on to things sometimes			0
we just do n't ask , out of courtesy			0
and also , if you ask , you may put it on yourself			0
@entity0 : do n't mess with the guy who could kill you off , huh ? @entity1 : exactly .			1
