-- attention single ladies ! comedian @entity7 , the best - selling author of " @entity8 , think like man " and a self - professed expert on manhood , is here to take you inside the male mind			1
comedian @entity7 says real men like to provide and protect , but some also like to cheat			1
whether you 're looking for mr. right or trying to forget mr. wrong , @entity7 is n't holding anything back			1
many women have long lists that describe what they 're looking for in a man ... but are their standards simply too high ? @entity18 and @entity19 are two 30 - something friends who have long lists			1
they 're here to ask @entity7 if they 'll ever find a man who meets all their requirements			1
@entity19 says she 's looking for a @entity31 - fearing , spontaneous @entity30 - @entity29 millionaire with straight teeth and nice shoes who wants children ... among other things			2
" that would be the lord , " @entity7 jokes			1
" i 'll be trying to meet him the same time you do			0
" if a woman is serious about her list , @entity7 says she should ask herself one question before turning down a date			1
" are you willing to be the same thing to him that you 're talking about on that list ? " he says			0
" a lot of women are not			2
" in general , do women even need a list ? @entity7 says single ladies do need to set standards			1
" i think lists are great			0
you 've got to have them			0
you 've got to know what you 're looking for , " he says			0
" without standards , you settle for stuff			0
" before you get discouraged , @entity7 reminds women to stay patient and remember that real men are n't afraid of standards and requirements			1
" you 've got to wait on this guy to come along			0
@entity31 has already made him , " he says			0
" he has a job			0
he 's wearing the clothes you like			2
you 're not waiting on him to be born			0
all you 've got to do is stay patient			0
" why do many successful , independent women have a hard time finding love ? there are millions of smart , beautiful women around the world who ca n't figure out why they 're unlucky in love , including a group of friends from @entity86			2
@entity7 is here to set them straight			1
@entity7 says many successful women dated good men but did n't know it at the time			1
" you do n't know the dna of a good man , " he says			2
even if you look like a million bucks -- and you have a few million in the bank -- @entity7 says a woman needs to know how a man shows his love			1
it 's all about the " three p 's			2
" @entity0 : can a list help you find love ? " we profess , we provide and we protect , " he says			1
" a man has got to see where he fits into the providing and protecting role			2
if you 've got everything , you can do everything , you 've got your own car ... you 've got a guard dog and a handgun			0
the guy is thinking , ' where do i fit in here ? ' " you 've got to make a space for him to fit in so he can come in and do what men do			2
" @entity7 does n't advise women to downplay their success or pack up their designer shoes			1
instead , he says strong women have to walk a thin line			2
" you ca n't let your independence and your ability to take care of yourself be the dominant factor of who you are , " he says			0
" you know how many times i hear women say : ' i do n't need a man			1
why do n't a man just come to me ? ' just like you 're saying it , you 're projecting it			2
if you 're projecting it , where does a man fit in there ? just relax			2
" @entity0 : how to act like a lady , think like a man after a few dates , some guys just stop returning calls and texts			2
even if they are n't interested , do n't they want closure ? @entity7 has a simple answer to this question ... no. " ladies , you 're not going to get closure from a man , " he says			1
" we do n't do closure			0
and you know why ? because we do n't even know you 're having an issue			0
" if you 're hoping for a courtesy call , @entity7 says you can forget about that too			1
" we 're not courteous			0
listen , it 's not in our dna as great communicators anyway , " he says			2
" see women keep waiting on closure			2
if you want closure , close			0
move on with your life			0
" how important is sex in a relationship ? sex , or " the cookie " as @entity7 calls it in his book , is a major point of contention for many couples			1
if you do n't think it 's important to your man , @entity7 says you 're wrong			1
" it 's critical , " he says			2
" it 's one of the three things that a man has to have			1
a man has to have love , support and the cookie			2
[ if ] anyone of those three things is missing in the relationship , he 's going to go get it somewhere else			0
" if a man is cheating or has the intention to cheat , why pursue commitment with one woman ? @entity198 found out her boyfriend of many years was cheating after he told her he was ready to settle down and get married			1
the male mind may be a mystery to women , but @entity7 says there 's a simple explanation for this behavior			1
" a man having sex outside of his relationship is very different from [ a woman ] , " he says			1
" once we shower and wash off , we cool			0
" please know that about a man			0
if he 's going to cheat , it has nothing to do with his emotional attachment to you or his feelings for you			1
" @entity7 says cheaters make promises to their significant others because they know that 's what women want to hear			1
" @entity198 , there 's nothing wrong with you			0
you have n't done anything , " he says			0
" sadly , many women have dated men who cheat ... and most of them do n't even know it			1
@entity7 says there are a few major reasons why men stray , though none of them excuse the behavior			1
the top 5 reasons : they can they think they can get away with it the man has n't become who he wants and needs to be or found who he truly wants to be with			1
what 's happening at home is n't " happening " like it used to			0
there 's always a woman out there willing to cheat with him			1
if you 're married to a mama 's boy , is there anything a wife can do to become the number one woman in his life ? before @entity264 married her husband of 13 years , she says she knew he was a mama 's boy			1
over the years , she 's grown tired of coming in second			0
@entity7 says the first mistake women like @entity264 make is thinking they can change their men			1
" you think if you give him enough cookie , bake it just right , he 'll straighten up , " he says			0
" that 's not what happens with a mama 's boy			1

" ' you ca n't do it if you 're playing me second to your mama			0
' " if that does n't work , @entity7 suggests appealing to the " three ps " -- profess , provide and protect			1

we 're unprotected , ' " he says			0

when you call on it and require it , we rise to the occasion			0
