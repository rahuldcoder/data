-- reactions to @entity2 at the @entity3 : people are still having them ! earlier this week , we heard what both @entity7 and @entity8 had to say about the performance			1
( spoiler alert : they think she 's just being @entity2			1
) but while both those stars were shrugging their shoulders , another music legend was sharpening her claws			2
" i 'm not old - fashioned , " @entity18 told @entity19 in an interview published tuesday			1
" she could have come out naked , and if she 'd just rocked the house , i would have said , ' you go , girl			1
' it just was n't done well			0
she ca n't dance , her body looked like hell , the song was n't great , one cheek was hanging out			0
and , chick , do n't stick out your tongue if it 's coated			0
" @entity33 : @entity8 reacts to @entity2 ' @entity3 performance ouch ! it 's one thing to slam @entity2 's choice of outfit or sexually - charged behavior ; it 's quite another to question the girl 's talent itself			1
and coming from someone who knows a thing or two about rockin ' it while wearing revealing outfits — not to mention clearly visible buttocks — that comment is harsher still			0
@entity33 : @entity7 defends @entity2 on ' @entity47 ' , plus 4 other things we learned evidently , @entity2 is taking @entity18 's burn in stride			1
she has n't responded to @entity18 's words on social media , choosing instead to keep touting the phenomenal success of " @entity55 , " her latest single			1
( " # 1 on @entity57			0
# 1 on digital songs			0
# 1 most added to pop radio			0
# 1 on @entity63 , " according to @entity2			2
) and maybe it was the young star 's high - road tactics — not to mention a barrage of criticism about her criticism — that prompted @entity18 to backtrack on @entity70 yesterday			1
" what i should have said [ is ] , " i did n't like it that much , but she 's pushing the envelope , being an artist ! " the @entity72 winner wrote			0
" she 's talented , & @entity79 [			2
] " good points all , @entity18 — though some might argue that " flicking that tongue as deamons do " should be grounds for at least a time - out			2
