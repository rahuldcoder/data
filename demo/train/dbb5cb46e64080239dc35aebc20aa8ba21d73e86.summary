forget everything we know and love about physical magazines			1
forget their weekly or monthly publishing schedule			0
forget all these qualities except for one : what it 's like to come to an end , and to take a deep breath			1
like @entity15 , almost all magazines will eventually go purely electronic			1
this should n't surprise anyone			0
already , nearly 40 % of tablet owners read digital newspapers or magazines , with nearly 10 % doing so daily			1
still , as i watch this shift , i ca n't help but feel a twinge of nostalgia			1
not for the paper , but for the boundaries			1
i miss the edges -- physical and psychological			1
i miss the start of reading a print magazine , but mostly , i miss the finish			1
i miss the satisfaction of putting the bundle down , knowing i have gotten through it all			0
on to the next thing			0
@entity15 ending print edition , job cuts expected it may seem strange to think about printed publications as having a " user experience			1
" but they do , of course			0
print is a technology as much as desktop computers and tablets are technology			2
one of the qualities most natural to the user experience of print is the sense of potential completion , defined by the physical edges			1
it is a quality that is wholly unnatural to digital formats			1
the digital reading experience makes one want to connect and expand outward			2
print calls for limit and containment			2
@entity61 , who invented the term " hypertext " in 1963 , also coined another word : @entity65			0
describing it , he said , " in an important sense there are no ' subjects ' at all ; there is only all knowledge , since the cross-connections among the myriad topics of this world simply can not be divided up neatly			2
" later , he added , " hierarchical and sequential structures , especially popular since @entity77 , are usually forced and artificial			0
" the digital landscape is the perfect playground for actualizing the intertwingular , since the same information can be referenced in an endless number of locations , can be remixed freely , and need not abide by any single hierarchy			2
it is this intertwingularity that can make navigating digital content so stressful			1
while a stack of printed back issues of @entity90 may seem intimidating , it is not unapproachable			0
the magazines may be dense , but you know where you stand as you read them			2
but what about staring at an empty search box leading into the deep archive of @entity99 ? petrifying			0
like standing on the edge of a giant reservoir in the dead of the night , looking down into its infinite blackness			0
link after related link keeps pushing you along until , suddenly , you may end up reading about polar bears on an entirely different website , and maybe you have n't been up for air in hours			0
magazine websites , like the @entity113 itself , open one up to continuous exploration through links and related content			0
there 's beauty in that , if one is up for total immersion			2
but it 's easier to become overwhelmed , or lost			1
@entity123 created the term " e-mail apnea " to describe holding your breath as you traverse the horrors of your inbox			0
i find myself experiencing digital apnea of all sorts			2
in the face of endless content streams , it 's hard to stop and take a breath			1
there is no print apnea			2
perhaps , at worst , one may experience library apnea -- standing before the vast greatness of the reading room in the @entity149 , for example			0
but even then , it 's different			0
there 's the cozy smell of old books and the softness of the aged pages			0
it 's more akin to basking in grandeur than to suffocating under information overload			0
it 's hard to feel the same reverence for our 24/7 @entity136 feeds			0
the question " how deep does it go ? " is one that that nobody had to ask the printed edition of @entity15			1
@entity15 ? it 's not so clear			1
it 's why we love " @entity171 " and " most e-mailed " lists -- they bring some relief of edges to the digital page			1
as more of our content consumption shifts digital , the onus lies on tablet and smartphone applications to find a way to create cleaner and more bite - sized forms of boundaries in a medium that does n't want to be contained			1
at the start of 2013 , @entity15 joins the legions of other digital - only publishers			1
we 're losing the paper , the touch and the romanticism of the printed object			0
but hopefully , we 'll find a way to create new edges .			0

@entity194 : like @entity15 , almost all magazines will eventually go purely electronic
**mod** : physical magazines have start and finish ; they give a sense of completion
he says digital formats lack edges and boundaries ; it 's harder for readers to focus
**mod** : until digital magazines make it easier to stop , there will be nostalgia for print
