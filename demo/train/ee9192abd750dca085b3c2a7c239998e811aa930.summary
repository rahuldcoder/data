-- a year ago , writer @entity1 set off a firestorm -- that 's what @entity3 called it on the " today " show -- with an essay in the @entity7 titled " marry him ! " her argument : if you 're a woman on the cusp of 30 , you should suck it up and settle down with mr. @entity13 , as waiting for mr. @entity15 probably means missing out , resigning yourself to a purgatory of depressing dates and meaningless flings until , finally , no one bothers to call anymore because you 're , gulp , too old			1
in a generation of women coming off the bacchanal of " @entity24 " , @entity26 's article hit like a horrible hangover			1
it entered the pantheon of incendiary articles about women and marriage that pop up in every era -- like the outrageous ( and later debunked ) claim , in @entity36 in 1986 , that a 40 - year - old woman was more likely to be killed by a terrorist than marry			1
@entity26 's piece polarized readers			2
some said her argument was common sense , that women must confront the biological realities that suggest they 're most marriageable when they 're young and fertile			1
other readers said she was telling women to sell out their dreams and shut down their hearts			1
@entity0 : 6 love decisions we 've made for you in time for @entity52 , @entity26 is back , with an entire book devoted to her theory			1
part " @entity56 " and part @entity57 , " marry him : the case for settling for mr. @entity13 " is surprisingly , unnervingly convincing			1
@entity26 interviewed an array of experts -- sociologists , behavioral economists , social psychologists , and statisticians -- who presented evidence about why online dating does n't work , what women can really expect when they 're in their 40s ( there are only 72 single men for every 100 women in the 45 - to - 65 - year - old demographic , according to a @entity78 @entity77 figure she cites ) , and why women are fundamentally the choosier sex			1
" there are so many really wonderful men out there , men who want commitment , who want to be married , who are attractive and smart and interesting , " @entity26 says			2
" they may not be movie - star attractive , they may be awkward at first , they may not fit our cultural image of who mr. right or who @entity90 is			1
but we should n't pass them up			2
look what happened to me			2
" what happened to @entity26 ? educated and independent , she is gorgeous , vivacious , and sharply witty			0
she went to @entity98 ; she has written several books , two of which have been optioned by @entity102			0
in other words , she is such a fantastic catch that she assumed she would never have to settle , that a @entity105 -- romantic , brilliant , baggage - free -- would emerge from the ether and sweep her into an eternally fulfilling marriage			0
but , she says , she missed the boat -- several times -- by focusing on potential mates ' flaws and expecting too much			0
now 42 , she has a 4 - year - old son , courtesy of a sperm donor			1
" we are taught as young women in this culture that compromise is a bad word , " she says			1
" we tell each other : ' you go , girl			0
' it 's not so much narcissism as a false cultural perception of our worth			0
we want the ten , because we think we 're a ten			0
but we 're missing the fact that we 're not			0
men have flaws , but we have flaws , too			0
" @entity0 : what woman learned from dating 100 men surely , some women will find " @entity139 " more than a little off - putting			1
its subtitle makes the prospect of marriage sound like a life sentence			2
and sometimes @entity26 's call to arms sounds so pragmatic as to be loveless			0
readers may also ask , what is an unhappily single woman doing , telling us how and why to get married ? but maybe the question is , who better ? for a woman who once would n't have thought of dating a short man in a bow tie , she has come a long way			2
( in the book , @entity26 described dating just such a guy , and you root for the pair , until he moves to @entity162			1
) she is currently " accepting invitations from men everywhere , " she says with a laugh			0
or as she puts it in the book 's dedication : " for my husband , whoever you are			2
