-- @entity1 , @entity3 's radio program sidekick , revealed monday that she has battled cancer for the past year			1
the revelation came following a question from a caller about when @entity8 would be returning to the studio			2
she has been working her gig from home since may of last year			1
@entity3 explained that right before her last day in the studio , @entity1 had been attending a wedding in @entity15 and found she was unable to urinate			1
a quick trip to the emergency room , where her bladder was drained using a catheter , did n't fix the problem , @entity3 said			1
" do you want to fill the audience in on what happened since then so that they understand why you have n't been in the studio ? " @entity3 asked @entity8 during monday 's show			1
quivers replied , " sure			2
i 'm ready to talk about it now , i guess			2
yeah , so i went to a doctor that afternoon and for about a week the story was that nobody really understood what was going on			2
they knew that there was a mass in my pelvis but nobody knew what it was , and eventually it was determined that i just had to have surgery and they 'd figure it out after going in			2
" quivers said she endured 12 hours of surgery after returning home to @entity47			1
the mass turned out to be cancerous and involved uterine tissue migrating outside her uterus , she said			2
" the tumor was about the size of a grapefruit , " she said			0
" there were two reasons that the operation was so long			0
it took eight hours to remove the tumor because it was so huge , it was lying on all the organs in my pelvis , and they literally had to scrape it off when they got to it			0
but also , they could n't even figure out how to operate ' cause it was so massive			0
" @entity3 , who at times sounded emotional , said he was worried that his friend and cohort of many years would not survive			1
" i was already making funeral arrangements , " he said			0
" not to make light of this situation , but i was freaking out			0
it was just this f * * * ing crazy thing that came out of left field and it was going down real quick			0
" but the story has what @entity3 called a " miraculous " ending			1
after undergoing treatment at @entity81 -- which included chemotherapy and an ileostomy , a surgical procedure to allow intestinal waste to pass out of the body through an opening in the skin and into a pouch -- quivers said doctors told her three and a half months ago that she is now cancer - free			1
" ( the doctor ) just looks at everything and she goes , ' you 're cured			0
you can just leave here			0
you know , the protocol is to scan you every three months and do all this stuff , but we do n't really have to , because you 're cured , ' " @entity8 said			0
@entity3 , who @entity8 said supported her through her illness , said he was overjoyed with the outcome			1
" i ca n't tell you when you see a friend , a life - long friend , going through this , what it 's like , " @entity3 said			1
" i 'll be honest			0
i thought she was a goner			0
you bet against anybody else except @entity1			1

quivers kept her cancer *diagnosis* *secret* for over a year
she 's been working her @entity3 gig from home
@entity1 says doctors tell her she is now cancer - free
