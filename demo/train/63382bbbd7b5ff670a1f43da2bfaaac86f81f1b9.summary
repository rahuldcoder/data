-- @entity2 gov. @entity1 built his keynote address to the @entity4 on the theme of telling tough truths to the nation			1
" we have become paralyzed by our desire to be loved , " announced @entity1 , showing off the gruff , no - nonsense style that catapulted him into the governor 's mansion			2
it 's only fair to mention some tough truths about his speech , his tenure as governor and the state of the @entity4 campaign for president			1
the most striking truth ( as @entity24 pointed out even before the address ) is that @entity2 under @entity1 has suffered from a severely troubled economy and soaring costs of government : the very things that @entity30 like @entity1 blame on @entity24			2
as of july , @entity2 's unemployment rate stands at 9.8 % : higher than the national average , fourth worst among the 50 states and the highest level in 35 years			1
the rate is higher than on the day @entity1 took office in 2010 and nearly a full percentage point higher than earlier this year , when @entity1 's state of the state address exultantly and repeatedly claimed that a " @entity40 " was under way			1
and despite @entity1 's boasts about trimming the cost of government in the @entity2 -- the keynote speech repeated his frequent claim of balancing three state budgets -- some fiscal watchdogs attribute the budgets to creative accounting , not true cost containment			1
" a hard truth @entity1 absolutely will not tell is that every one of his budgets has been unbalanced by more than $ 2.5 billion , " notes @entity52 news blogger @entity51 , citing @entity1 's bad habit -- started by previous governors -- of skimping on payments into the state 's pension fund			1
this year , for example , @entity1 paid just over $ 1 billion into the fund , a record amount but far less than the $ 3.74 billion that actuaries said was needed , according to @entity51			0
those unpaid billions are , in effect , a loan that will have to be repaid by taxpayers someday			0
no wonder @entity1 omitted " @entity2 comeback " from his keynote address			1
put aside the ugly economics , and @entity1 's speech was unusually good			1
he read well from the teleprompter , even though he normally speaks without a prepared text			0
and he was persuasive , showing off the skills of his old job as a federal prosecutor			0
most important , from a political perspective , @entity1 had a smooth launch onto the national stage , talking more about @entity1 -- much more -- than about the man of the hour , candidate @entity84			0
in the seven - page text of the address sent to reporters , @entity84 's name does n't appear until near the bottom of page five			2
that 's no surprise : keynote addresses at the national conventions often serve as the launching pad for politicians preparing their own bids for president , and @entity1 has not shied away from talk that he might be a candidate in 2016 or later			2
but even the most successful convention - speech - as - launch - pad of recent times -- the keynote delivered at the 2004 @entity24 convention by a then - little - known @entity106 state senator named @entity107 -- lavishly praised sen. @entity108 , the party 's nominee that year			0
though @entity107 called @entity108 's name 13 times in that speech , @entity1 mentioned @entity84 only seven times			1
clearly , @entity1 's political star is rising			2
but he may also need to refine his " tough truths " mantra			0
the underlying message -- a promise to shrink government and reduce programs like @entity122 -- is risky business in an election year			0
voters , like supermarket shoppers , want as much as they can get for as little as they can get away with paying			0
our nation 's airwaves and billboards are chock full of companies advertising two - for - one sales and buy - one - get - one - free specials for a reason : it works			0
by contrast , you rarely see stores advertise the hard truth that the product is n't as good as they thought , the supplies are limited and the cost is going up			0
if the tough - talk message helps @entity84 win the @entity145 in november , @entity1 is assured a bright future on the national stage			1
but if he hopes to repeat any version of @entity107 's astounding leap from keynote to candidate , he 'll have to get @entity2 's fiscal house in order pronto			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity156 .			0

@entity1 built his keynote address to @entity4 on theme of telling tough truths to @entity161
@entity156 says the @entity2 governor has to face the tough truths about his own state
@entity2 's unemployment rate is high , and there are questions about finances , he says
louis : @entity1 's speech went over well , but he did n't mention @entity84 until late in his talk
