-- president @entity2 's remarks thursday on the death of @entity4 were an echo of his powerful 2013 speech on @entity8 's shooting			1
notably absent was any mention of race			0
a year ago , the acquittal of @entity8 's shooter sparked protests across the @entity14			1
@entity8 was 17 and armed with nothing more than a bag of @entity18 candy			1
protestors believed that @entity21 's self - defense law helped enable civilian @entity22 to racially profile @entity8 and justify shooting him in self - defense			1
studies had found that whites who kill blacks are more likely to be found justified in " stand your ground " states like @entity21			0
now , a police officer 's fatal shooting of @entity4 , an @entity33 , in @entity34 , @entity30 has reignited the discussion about racial injustice in @entity14			2
@entity4 was 18 and planned to start college this week			0
witnesses said he was shot multiple times when he refused to comply with an officer 's order to " get the f --- onto the sidewalk " or " get the f --- out of the street			0
" 5 things to know about @entity4 's shooting although the identity of the officer has not been released , a witness who was walking with @entity4 at the time told @entity0 that the officer is white			0
in a primarily black city , only three of @entity34 's police officers are african - american			0
@entity57 and @entity58 are abuzz with # iftheygunnedmedown , where young men and women pair a rebellious image of themselves next to a telegenic , shirt - and - tie one to highlight societal stereotypes of minorities			2
officer in @entity34 shooting had no prior disciplinary record in response to what has become another debate of national -- and racial -- proportion , president @entity2 advised on tuesday : " we should comfort each other and talk with one another in a way that heals , not in a way that wounds			1
" he alluded to the protests and looting in @entity81			0
the looting was opportunistic , people taking advantage of a tragedy as a cover for criminal activity			2
and some of the unrest was a cry for help , desperate acts to get attention from a criminal justice system that has not adequately addressed problems of racial injustice in @entity14			1
complete coverage on @entity34 shooting and protests but there is a major difference between the way the president addressed race in his @entity8 speech and his @entity4 remarks thursday			1
it is representative of the growing disconnect between an administration that has promised to alleviate racial injustice , and a community in which there is a strong sense of disappointment			2
after president @entity2 's lyrical speech on race during his 2008 presidential campaign , minorities and civil rights groups expected the election of a black president to be more than just symbolic			1
this hope was solidified in the president 's selection of the first black @entity14 attorney general in 2009			2
while his first term reflected a lull in civil rights legislation , president @entity2 's 2013 speech on @entity8 promised more			1
he emphasized the importance of racial profiling legislation , even though @entity22 was a civilian and such legislation affects law enforcement			1
he indicated a new focus on such laws and described the one he had successfully passed as a state senator in @entity137			0
the president also suggested he would work on improving conditions for young black men to succeed and called for the examination of state and local laws like the @entity21 " stand your ground " laws			2
however since then , not much has happened			0
the special nature of state police powers has made federal action difficult			0
about two dozen states have passed self - defense laws similar to the @entity21 one that may have helped lead the jury to exonerate @entity22 , but not one state has repealed them			0
even on a federal level , the @entity155 , a @entity157 hearing and @entity159 investigations have produced no solutions on such laws and the racial profiling that is inherent in their enforcement			1
the @entity159 considered filing a civil rights lawsuit against @entity22 , but did not			0
in addition , the administration has not made a strong effort to rally @entity170 around racial profiling legislation			1
in the meantime , allegations of racially biased actions by police have flitted across headlines , such as the @entity178 's " stop and frisk " policy and chokehold incidents that disproportionately affect blacks			0
social media and activism has brought underreported stories and photos to the forefront : for example , the case of @entity187 , a mentally ill @entity21 prisoner whose skin separated from his body when guards locked him into a 180 - degree shower , originally garnered only local media attention			2
now the petition to the @entity14 @entity159 to investigate his death has over 160,000 signatures across the nation			0
president @entity2 was right in encouraging talking and reflection , in criticizing @entity34 police for harassing peaceful protestors and journalists , and in involving the @entity30 governor in crisis resolution			1
but he is speaking to an audience that wants more			0
the president should take proactive measures to address the @entity4 case in particular , and racial injustice in general			1
unlike the @entity159 's previous investigation , news of which came and went with the news of the @entity8 protests , the @entity211 and @entity159 's investigation into @entity4 's death needs to be thorough , transparent and broadcast to the public			2
most importantly , the administration should make racial profiling legislation a top priority			1
eliminating racial injustice in the criminal justice system is an almost sisyphean task because of the many levels -- surveillance , arrest , conviction , sentencing and imprisonment			1
the roots of injustice are deep and tangled			0
the factors that lead to tragedies such as the death of @entity4 are entwined with the human psyche , implicit bias and socioeconomic factors that are beyond the government 's control			0
racial profiling legislation in particular is valued because it attacks the issue at its origin			1
by preventing law enforcement from disproportionately targeting ethnic minorities for investigation , interrogation and arrest , we affect the later stages of the justice system			1
through training and monitoring , we change the culture of our police and court systems			0
in 2003 , as a state senator in @entity137 , @entity2 did pass such a bill with unanimous support			2
the state legislation called for the collection of data on traffic stops and the race of the person who was stopped -- a measure that can be extended more broadly for a national bill			2
his bill also trained police departments on professionalization and avoiding racial biases			2
the @entity170 has been less receptive to such measures			0
despite the many cries for change , the efforts of sen. @entity275 and rep. @entity276 to pass the @entity279 in @entity170 have been unsuccessful			0
but with the same fierce diplomacy that passed healthcare reform through a recalcitrant @entity170 , president @entity2 can rally @entity170 to honor @entity4 , a promising teenage boy whose tragic death could have been prevented by racial profiling legislation			1
president @entity2 is our best chance for the " more perfect union " he called for as a presidential hopeful in 2008			1
a white man 's response to @entity34 join us on @entity57 / @entity290 .			0
