on a holiday marking the birth of a nation of immigrants , protesters and counterprotesters began a new round of angry demonstrations friday in a @entity9 town that was scheduled to receive new busloads of migrants arrested for entering the country illegally			1
the small @entity9 city of @entity14 , named after a @entity15 whose family set up a sheep ranch there in 1873 , is now a national flashpoint in the @entity21 immigration crisis : protesters are denouncing the federal transfer of detained migrants to their town for processing at a local @entity27 office			1
demonstrators successfully blockaded busloads from entering the town earlier this week			1
a second convoy of federal buses carrying migrants to a @entity21 @entity27 station in @entity14 was expected friday , and @entity14 resident @entity35 joined protesters to express his outrage about illegal border crossings			1
a surge of undocumented @entity41 immigrants has created a federal crisis , and some of them are supposed to be processed in @entity14			1
" there 's a right way and a wrong way to come into this country			2
if you are going to come in the wrong way , we 're not going to stand for it			1
that 's just how it is , " @entity35 said			2
" there ( are ) thousands and millions of other people who 've done it the right way			2
but for people to just come in here and ask for a free handout , that 's my money			2
" @entity62 of @entity63 defended the immigrants ' rights to due process -- and noted how the @entity21 was built by immigrants			2
" it 's not a us versus we situation			2
it 's everybody together , " said @entity62 , who described herself as an undocumented student			2
police arrested at least one protester friday morning			1
no further details were immediately available			2
exchange of hard words the protests have been emotionally charged , with racial slurs uttered against @entity85 defending the rights of the arrested immigrants , some of whom may be refugees , the immigration rights advocates say			0
but on @entity89 , protesters held placards saying , " it 's not about race			0
" others said , " no human is illegal , " and " no white supremacy			0
" police secured the road so the entry to the @entity27 office was clear , though a smaller group of protesters found a way to camp on the side of the road			1
a quarter of a mile away , a yellow police line held back the larger demonstration of dozens of protesters , and by friday afternoon , police put up a second yellow tape and stood between the two factions of demonstrators to stop their pushing and shoving			1
protesters chanted , " @entity21 ! @entity21 ! " counterprotesters chanted , " @entity116 , " which translates as " the ( @entity118 ) race united will never be defeated			0
" apparently supporting them , men and women in @entity122 costumes trimmed with feathers danced to a drumbeat			0
police warned participants not to fight			1
some of them suffered heat exposure in the 100 - degree sunshine and found relief under a tent			0
" we do n't want anyone to get hurt			0
there 's children here , " a police officer told protesters			1
both sides waved @entity21 flags , but one demonstrator held a shredded @entity21 flag , angering an adversary who yelled : " absolute disgrace ! " @entity145 @entity144 did n't mind spending the @entity89 in a protest that was hot by any standard			1
" it 's @entity89 -- for whom and why , " @entity144 said			0
" this is a refugee crisis that we 're dealing with ...			0
if these people were from say , @entity155 , trying to get here from the violence that ruptured the @entity155 , maybe these people would be for that			0
" @entity14 's concerns and compassion residents object to how @entity21 agents may " dump " the @entity41 immigrants into their community once their processing is completed , a practice that was true in the past , said @entity14 mayor @entity167			1
both sides of the protest , he said , seek a legal , efficient process for the overflow of arrested migrants			1
" we 're sending people in inhumane conditions and dispersing them across the nation , " @entity167 said			0
on tuesday , the federal government began busing 140 migrants for processing in @entity14 every 72 hours , raising concerns about operational capacity , @entity167 said			1
the initial federal plan called for 500 people , which was lowered to 300 , but the city strongly opposed those plans			0
" the concern we have is the sustainability of 140 every 72 hours , " @entity167 said			0
" we do n't see this stopping any time soon			0
" @entity167 said earlier this week that his city " continues to object to the transfer of illegal immigrants to the local @entity27 office			1
" a subsequent protest in agreement became raucous tuesday ; a counterprotester was spat upon			2
@entity167 described portions of that protest as " unfortunate " and " deplorable			1
" the city had offered @entity21 officials a mobile health clinic to help them provide health screenings and inoculations for the migrants , but the federal approval process would have been too long			1
" the world has never been able to see how compassionate our community is because we never got there , " @entity167 said			1
the first protest federal officials were n't disclosing arrival times friday for the immigrants or even the cities receiving them , citing safety concerns in light of tuesday 's protests in @entity14			1
the town became a battleground over immigration that day as angry crowds chanted , " go back home , " and forced buses carrying immigrants to turn around			0
counterprotesters squared off with demonstrators , leading to a shouting match over the nation 's immigration system			2
as chaos ensued , federal officials rerouted the 140 undocumented immigrants to @entity21 processing centers at least 80 miles away , in the @entity237 and @entity238 areas			2
a tide of @entity41 illegally entering the @entity21 has overwhelmed a system already buckling under the weight of the nation 's 11 million undocumented immigrants			0
unlike undocumented @entity245 migrants , who are often immediately deported , the @entity21 detains and processes @entity41 , who are eventually released and given a month to report to immigration offices			2
protests and tension many never show up and join the undocumented population , according to the @entity254 , the union representing @entity27 agents			0
the immigrants rejected by @entity14 protesters were initially held in @entity257 , where @entity21 facilities are overflowing , forcing detainees to be sent to other states for processing			1
the government does n't have the room to shelter the children with adults : there 's only one family immigration detention center , in @entity268			0
to assist the unaccompanied children , the @entity270 administration opened shelters last month on three military bases because federal facilities more designed for adults were overrun with minors			0
tuesday 's busloads did n't include any unaccompanied minors , said @entity14 police chief @entity278			1
the children on the buses were apparently in the company of relatives or other adults , said an official with the @entity254			0
immigration rights advocates denounced the protesters			0
" it is deplorable that people espousing anti-immigrant hate language created unnecessary tension and fear for immigrant mothers and their children , " said @entity288 , a community representative of the @entity289			1
" even more concerning is that elected officials in the city of @entity14 instigated this tension			1
mothers and their children on these buses have suffered through enough trauma			0
" journey from @entity257 the @entity21 government earlier flew the 140 @entity41 immigrants from south @entity257 to @entity237			2
federal agents were busing them to @entity14 for processing at the @entity27 station when the standoff took place tuesday			1
after the buses turned around , the immigrants were taken to a @entity21 @entity27 station in @entity237 , said @entity312 of the @entity254			0
the @entity21 is struggling to accommodate an influx of undocumented immigrants , particularly a wave of unaccompanied children from @entity317 , @entity318 and @entity319			0
the @entity21 government does n't have enough beds , food or sanitary facilities			0
authorities estimate 60,000 to 80,000 children will cross the border without parents this year in what the @entity327 has called an " immediate humanitarian crisis			0

@entity14 mayor calls parts of earlier protest " unfortunate " and " deplorable "
" @entity336 has never been able to see how compassionate our community is , " he adds
residents fear officials would dump migrants in community , mayor says
police stand between the two factions of demonstrators to stop shoving
