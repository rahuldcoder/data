-- so that i could best understand the depth of his revulsion for the crime , the police investigator suggested that i pay a visit to the elevator where it allegedly took place			1
the elevator is just a few steps inside the @entity13 entrance to @entity15 's @entity14			1
the train station , in the decades before the jet age , was the indispensable hub for @entity20 's interstate travel			1
it remains , in the @entity23 era , cavernous and rife with echoes			2
it is as if the structure was designed to make mere mortals feel small			0
the vast station , when it is filled with passengers heading to and from @entity23 trains and local commuter lines , can lead a person to half - believe that in the bustle no one notices him			0
unless someone is making it a point to notice			0
" he is 27 years old , " said @entity38 , an investigator for @entity23 's police department			1
" he is able to travel by himself			0
he 's a very likeable guy			1
" the man he was talking about suffers from cerebral palsy			1
physically slight , he has only one leg			0
he has three fingers on each hand			0
with determination and quiet daily courage , he is able to get around independently by using a motorized chair			0
" there are people who hang around the front door and look for victims , " @entity38 said			1
" @entity52 is usually the crime of choice			1
officers inside the train station are on alert for thieves who attempt to relieve travelers of their wallets on escalators or stairways			0
@entity38 has worked in law enforcement for 30 years			0
some offenses still have the power to infuriate him , because they violate not only the law , but any basic definition of humanity			1
as pedestrians stream through that @entity13 door , rushing to make their trains on the lower level , few even glance toward the little elevator landing to the right of the entrance			1
on surveillance video recorded in august , @entity38 said , the young man , trying to get to a commuter train , is clearly visible entering the station			1
because he is unable to use stairs , he steers his chair to his right , toward the elevator			2
also on the video are two men , @entity38 said , who " follow him right to the elevator			2
both get on with him			0
" the elevator is small , relatively cramped , with a low ceiling			2
what reportedly happens next is what is so ghastly			0
the man in the motorized chair has his cash and a cellphone zipped into a satchel strapped to his waist			2
this is his custom when he leaves the house ; he lives with his mother , and the cellphone is his lifeline			0
on the surveillance video , the men who have followed him to the elevator -- later identified by police and by the @entity111 's office as @entity112 , 48 , and @entity113 , 49 -- strike up a conversation with him			1
then , according to investigators , one guards the elevator door to make certain no one else tries to enter , while the other reaches down and takes what he wants from the man in the chair			1
they allegedly take his phone and cash			0
they seem to be in no hurry ; because of his missing fingers , he can not grasp the items as they are taken from him			0
he does his best to resist , but it is as if the men are casually removing items from a store shelf			0
then , leaving him in the elevator , they simply walk away and go back into the city			2
the young man , alone in the busy train station , told an @entity23 police officer what had been done to him			1
( " nothing like this had ever happened to me before , " the young man told me the other afternoon			2
" i tried to respond to it with as much grace as i could			0
but after it was over , it just felt like such an indignity			0
" ) from the surveillance video , investigators made still photos and showed them around			0
one officer assigned to @entity14 recognized @entity112 as a man who had been warned to stay out of the terminal			1
the next time he showed up he was arrested for criminal trespass and , according to @entity38 , said that @entity113 had been his accomplice in the elevator robbery			1
a @entity15 police detective knew where to find @entity113 : in @entity158			1
it seems that , one day after the @entity14 robbery , he had been arrested for a crime a few miles away			1
at the @entity164 complex , a 75 - year - old woman was visiting her ailing husband			0
alone in an elevator , she was easy pickings			2
police had apprehended @entity113 for allegedly robbing her			2
both men face eight felony counts for what they allegedly did to the young man in @entity14			1
they have entered not guilty pleas ; i asked a representative of the office of the @entity158 public defender whether the lawyers assigned to the men would discuss the case or comment on it , and he declined on their behalf			0
what we refer to as the justice system will now kick in			0
cases such as this one can come and go , news blips competing for the attention of a busy public already barraged by torrents of bad news			0
strong - arm crimes against those least able to defend themselves are on occasion described as " petty " when the victim is not seriously injured			0
judges sometimes allow offenders to plead to lesser charges , to speed up the process and unclog the overloaded courts system			1
the assistant state 's attorney prosecuting the case -- @entity205 -- specializes in crimes against the elderly and the disabled			1
it has come to this : the very people whom society as a whole should be most dedicated to helping are instead so often targets of soulless crime that a special subcategory of prosecution has been developed to deal with those who would hurt them			1
once we begin to shrug at the inevitability of such crimes -- once we begin to accept that , in a cold world , this is just the way things are -- we are heading down a dark and sorry path			1
because once we stop caring , we , too , have been robbed of something precious			2
the young man 's cellphone and his money , investigator @entity38 told me , are long gone ; he will never see them			1
" i count my blessings , " the young man told me			2
" i do n't want to be a ' woe - is - me ' type			0
i 've never been that kind of person			0
" out of a sense of duty , he rode a train back into the city so that he could attend a police lineup to identify the alleged offenders			1
there will be status hearings and continuances , and eventually , when and if the case goes to trial , the young man will , in his motorized chair , with considerable difficulty make his way to the courthouse to testify			2
when he entered the train - station elevator that day , the two men who followed him became an unwanted part of his life for years to come			2

@entity263 : a disabled man was robbed in an elevator at @entity15 's @entity14
he says police investigator *revolted* by crime against man , trapped with robbers
he says alleged *assailants* arrested . he *laments* such people often get off on lesser charges
@entity263 : if we shrug and accept when *helpless* victimized , we too are robbed -- of humanity
