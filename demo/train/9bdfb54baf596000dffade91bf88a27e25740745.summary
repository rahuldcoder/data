for the first time , a computer program passed the @entity2 for artificial intelligence			1
a computer on saturday was able to trick one third of a team of researchers convened by the @entity8 into believing it was human -- in this case a 13 - year old boy named @entity12			1
the @entity2 , named for @entity14 mathematician @entity13 , is often thought of as the benchmark test for true machine intelligence			1
since he introduced it in 1950 , thousands of scientific teams have tried to create something capable of passing , but none has succeeded			0
and that outcome means we need to start grappling with whether machines with artificial intelligence should be considered persons , as far as the law is concerned			1
in 1920 , @entity28 introduced the mainstream world to the concept of artificial people in his play " @entity37 " ( the word robot comes from the @entity35 word for serf labor )			1
since then , society has been fascinated by the idea of a robot walking among us , or even crossing over into personhood like a modern - day @entity43			1
the fascination continues ; just take a look at this year 's box office			1
in the recent film " @entity48 , " @entity47 starred as a sentient machine			0
in the critically acclaimed " her , " @entity52 's character fell in love with an advanced operating system named @entity56			1
coming attractions include more installments in the rebooted " @entity60 " franchise ; " @entity61 : episode vii , " with its universally lovable droids ; and , of course , " @entity65			0
" a question at the heart of all these movies is this : at what point does a computer move from property to personhood ? robotic legal personhood in the near future makes sense			2
artificial intelligence is already part of our daily lives			1
bots are selling stuff on @entity82 and @entity83 , and semiautonomous agents are determining our eligibility for @entity86			0
predator drones require less and less supervision , and robotic workers in factories have become more commonplace			0
@entity91 is testing self - driving cars , and @entity93 has announced that it expects semiautonomous vehicles to be on the road by 2020			0
when the robot messes up , as it inevitably will , who exactly is to blame ? the programmer who sold the machine ? the site owner who had nothing to do with the mechanical failure ? the second party , who assumed the risk of dealing with the robot ? what happens when a robotic car slams into another vehicle , or even just runs a red light ? liability is why some robots should be granted legal personhood			1
as a legal person , the robot could carry insurance purchased by its employer			1
as an autonomous actor , it could indemnify others from paying for its mistakes , giving the system a sense of fairness and ensuring commerce could proceed unchecked by the twin fears of financial ruin and of not being able to collect			0
we as a society have given robots power , and with that power should come the responsibility of personhood			2
from the practical legal perspective , robots could and should be people			2
as it turns out , they can already officially fool us into thinking that they are , which should only strengthen their case			0
the notion of personhood has expanded significantly , albeit slowly , over the last few thousand years			0
throughout history , women , children and slaves have all at times been considered property rather than persons			2
the category of persons recognized in the courts has expanded to include entities and characters including natural persons aside from men ( such as women , slaves , human aliens , illegitimate children and minors ) as well as unnatural or juridical persons , such as corporations , labor unions , nursing homes , municipalities and government units			2
legal personality makes no claim about morality , sentience or vitality			0
to be a legal person is to have the capability of possessing legal rights and duties within a certain legal system , such as the right to enter into contracts , own property , sue and be sued			0
not all legal persons have the same rights and obligations , and some entities are only considered " persons ' " for some matters and not others			2
just last month , the @entity190 heard arguments in the @entity193 case about whether a corporation is person enough to ask for a religious exemption			0
new categories of personhood are matters of decision , not discovery			0
the establishment of personhood is an assessment made to grant an entity rights and obligations , regardless of how it looks and whether it could pass for human			0
to make the case for granting personhood to robots , it 's not necessary to show that they can function as persons in all the ways that a " person " may be understood by a legal system			1
it 's enough to show that they may be considered persons for a particular set of actions in a way that makes the most sense legally and logically .			1

computer program passes the @entity2 for artificial intelligence for the first time
@entity230 : it 's a sign that the age of robots has truly arrived
he says it 's time to *rewrite* the law to permit *recognition* of robots as persons
@entity242 : a robot could be held liable for *damages* -- and it might need insurance
