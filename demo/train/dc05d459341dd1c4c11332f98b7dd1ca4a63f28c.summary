-- plane makers swooped to conquer at @entity5 's biggest air show but rather than picking up any huge deals , smaller agreements and partnerships were the order of the day			1
the event still saw $ 31 billion worth of deals announced ; triple the total of the previous show in 2010			1
however , two thirds of that was down to @entity16 low - cost airline @entity14 formally sealing its deal for 230 next - generation @entity18 , first reported last year			1
" the fate of the commercial aviation industry generally follows the fate of national economies , " says @entity19 of @entity20			0
" the mood generally is a little bit uncertain , but ( the outcome from the show ) is a little better than expected			1
" @entity16 's economy is one of @entity5 's fastest growing -- @entity30 grew there by 6.5 % last years -- and @entity14 also announced another deal this week for a fleet of short - haul planes from @entity35 for its subsidiary , @entity36			1
budget @entity38 airline @entity37 joined the billion - dollar deal club by signing an agreement with engine maker @entity42 , worth around $ 1 billion			1
" ( these deals ) shows a greater trend that developing countries are leading the world in demand ( for new planes ) , " says @entity19			2
" @entity16 is an underdeveloped market ; there is no doubt there 's great potential in the region			1
" but on the same day that @entity56 went into administration stranding 4,000 passengers , there is some apprehension that the region could be blighted by airlines with too many planes and not enough passengers to fill them			0
" when airlines start to fail that 's a bit of a worry			2
any airline has to be cautious about adding capacity irrationally			2
historically the airline industry has n't done that , " says @entity19			2
@entity72 has found itself in a good position , and perhaps an example to others , says @entity19 , by building up a good base in its home market before taking on the world			0
" if you do n't get the base right , you wo n't succeed in this industry			0
" the week also saw @entity83 plane maker @entity82 announcing another corporate client ( @entity85 ) for its yet to be built @entity87 jet			0
but these smaller deals belie the impact @entity83 's aviation industry may have in two years ' time when the jet is first trialed , believes the @entity94 organizer , @entity93			1
" the market is very dispersed in @entity83 , but when the @entity87 plane goes to market its capability will be stronger , " he says			0
@entity83 's market is unique and @entity19 believes its airlines are in a good position to not do things irrationally			0
" they are doing a lot of things right , but then they are supported by the government and often fulfilling a national need in terms of flying routes that might not be so profitable			0
