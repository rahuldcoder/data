-- it 's not often that someone you know and consider a friend is awarded the @entity5			1
i first met then - staff sgt. @entity7 in @entity8 in 2010			1
we had dinner with three of his fellow soldiers -- then - sgt. 1st class @entity13 , sgt. @entity15 and sgt. @entity16			0
over beer and @entity20 food , they talked about their time in the @entity21 and their experiences at @entity23 in @entity24			0
i was working on a book about the remote outpost in which they 'd served ; the four troops candidly and generously shared their thoughts with me			0
@entity7 ( pronounced @entity30 - muh - shay ) was dark and sardonic			1
it was clear that he respected basic military values of selflessness , courage and efficiency , and had little tolerance for those who did not			0
it 's not surprising , because he comes from a military family			2
both of his brothers joined the military after high school , following in the footsteps of their father , a @entity49 veteran , and their grandfather , who served during @entity51 for the @entity52 , military service is a family tradition			0
at the dinner , @entity7 talked about leaving the @entity21 and spending more time with his wife , @entity57 , and their three children			1
within a year , he did exactly that			0
they all now live in @entity62 , @entity63			0
@entity7 works as a field safety specialist for an oil field construction firm 90 minutes away			1
@entity7 is modest about the actions for which president @entity67 will award him on february 11 with the nation 's highest honor for courage			1
maybe you saw his modesty in our interview of him , which aired in an hourlong @entity0 special on thursday , february 7 , at 10 p.m. et. maybe you saw the way he talks about that horrible day -- october 3 , 2009 -- when he and about 50 other @entity78 soldiers faced overwhelming @entity80 forces numbering more than 300			1
even more terrifying than their numbers was their positional superiority : a 360 degree assault from the high ground			0
@entity23 had been built at the bottom of three steep mountains , providing the enemy from day one with a tactical advantage			0
for all the glory bestowed on @entity92 , he is still torn apart because of those he could n't save that night , those whom no one could have saved			1
the humility in the interview , his disappointment in not having been able to save every troop 's life , is haunting			1
excerpt : " the outpost : an @entity102 " " my granddaddy used to teach me , you know , ' when you tell someone you 're going to do something , you do it			0
you know , your actions is what makes you			0
' and i know i 'm hard on myself , but you know it still hurts , " @entity7 told me			1
eight @entity78 troops were killed at @entity23 , and the camp was overrun by the @entity80			1
but because of the valorous actions of troops like @entity7 -- and others , including @entity13 , @entity15 , @entity16 , sgt. @entity120 , lt. @entity121 and more -- ultimately , the @entity78 was able to push the @entity80 back and regain control of the camp			1
@entity7 's leadership was crucial , and his fellow troops say they wonder if they would have survived without his fierce determination			1
" there are few people i would follow to hell and back , and @entity7 is one of them , " former pvt. 1st class @entity127 told us			1
i interviewed more than 225 individuals for my book about the attack , " the outpost : an @entity102 , " which also details the history of the outpost			0
i met many brave troops along the way			0
@entity7 , without question , stands out			2
he and i have spent hours talking about the battle ( and other matters too , since we became friends ) , and some of those conversations will be with me always			2
he 's a laconic guy , @entity7 , the type you might see in a cowboy movie			1
few words , strong deeds			0
the love and dedication he has for his troops , and the degree to which he 's moved when they return those emotions with performance in the line of duty , is almost palpable			2
" to watch those guys say we 're short numbered but we 've got the stones , we 're gon na man up			0
this is what 's required of us			2
we 're gon na dig deep and we 're gon na man up , " @entity7 says			2
" i mean , it 's amazing to watch that great sacrifice , losing out on sleep , long , hard days , running up and down the mountains with less guys than the unit before			2
we took pride in that , that we did more with less and that was our motto for a while			0
" there are 79 living @entity5 recipients , according to the @entity177 ; @entity7 will be the 80th			1
i am proud to know him			0
