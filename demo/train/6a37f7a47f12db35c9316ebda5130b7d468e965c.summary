@entity0 -- the death of a 14 - year - old girl who was apparently fatally savaged by a pack of dogs at a friend 's home has prompted horror in @entity9			1
@entity10 formally identified the girl wednesday as @entity12			1
she was found dead at a house in @entity14 , near @entity15 in northwest @entity16 , on tuesday afternoon after police were called about reports of an unconscious girl and " out - of - control " dogs			1
armed officers were confronted by a pack of dogs , described as " aggressive			1
" four were killed , and a fifth , which was shut up elsewhere in the house , was contained			1
more clues about what sparked the attack on @entity12 may be revealed by an autopsy wednesday , police said			1
the schoolgirl was alone at the house , which she was visiting , when she was apparently mauled , police said			1
the dogs ' remains will be examined as part of the investigation , which will also look at the breeds involved , police said			1
@entity9 newspaper reports suggest that an @entity40 bulldog , two @entity42 bull terriers and a bull mastiff attacked the teenager			1
none of those breeds are banned in @entity9			0
police superintendent @entity47 said it was " a deeply distressing incident for everyone involved " and expressed condolences to @entity12 's family			1
" they are understandably devastated by what has happened , as are @entity12 's circle of friends , " he said in a police statement			1
he told reporters later wednesday that reports of the dogs attacking after @entity12 brought a meat pie into the house were speculation , but acknowledged that the attack came at lunchtime , after she 'd left and returned			1
" this afternoon we sadly lost one of our students , @entity12			2
our thoughts are with her parents and family , " the @entity69 account for her high school said			0
dealing with dangerous dogs a report by the @entity9 parliament 's @entity77 last month said seven people , five of them children , had been killed by dogs in homes in @entity9 since 2007			2
the cost to the @entity84 of treating severe dog attack injuries is more than 3 million pounds ( $ 4.5 million ) a year , it said			0
" current dangerous dogs laws have comprehensively failed to tackle irresponsible dog ownership , " the report said , adding that the latest government proposals are " woefully inadequate			2
" @entity47 , the police superintendent , said he was not aware that any formal complaints had been made against the dogs involved in tuesday 's attack			2
humane societies point out that it is often the actions of owners , rather than the particular breed , that make a dog dangerous			2
animal psychologist @entity98 , who founded the @entity9 - based training and @entity100 , which works with problem dogs , echoes that view			1
" everything is down to the owner , " he told @entity1			0
" owners know if their dog is a hazard or is not friendly			2
" in a home with several dogs , the animals could be expected to behave as a group in a territorial way , he said			0
" so a stranger going into a home with five dogs would be seen as a threat , someone to be challenged or even attacked			0
" once one dog attacks , the others are likely to join in , and self - defense becomes almost impossible , he added			0
assuming the worst some breeds are banned in @entity9 under the @entity122			0
they include the pit bull terrier , the @entity126 @entity125 , the @entity127 and the @entity128 , as well as dogs that may be crossbreeds but share the characteristics of these breeds			2
but it 's not the breed involved , but how the animal has been trained that counts , @entity98 said , although bigger dogs can inflict more harm if they become aggressive			2
" it 's a fallacy that one breed is more dangerous than another , " he said			0
" everyone has prejudices ... but the willingness to bite is probably the same , on average , in a bichon frise as in a @entity146			0
" @entity98 recommends that owners take action as soon as they spot any warning signs -- by going to a dog trainer or qualified behaviorist , asking a veterinarian for advice or investing in a muzzle			1
" if you have a big dog , or several big dogs , it 's pretty obvious that you must take it very seriously indeed , " he said			2
" assume that the worst can or might happen			0
" the laws in @entity9 are sufficient to protect people if they are enforced , he said			0
" but more than anything , we need common sense -- punishment after the act is not the solution , we need behavior that anticipates problems			0
" pit bull issue the debate over dangerous dogs is also heated in the @entity40 , where the @entity174 has been campaigning against a @entity175 ruling in august that pit bull terriers are " inherently dangerous			1
" under the ruling , dog owners and their landlords are responsible for any injuries caused by pit bulls			1
the @entity174 says it 's wrong to discriminate by breed			0
" singling out a particular breed or type of dog has repeatedly been proven to be ineffective at curbing dog bites because breed alone is not predictive of whether a dog may pose a danger , " its website says			0
" a dog 's propensity to bite is a product of several factors primarily under the owner 's control , including early socialization , whether the dog is spayed or neutered and whether the dog is isolated or chained			0
