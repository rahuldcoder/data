-- when @entity2 plays @entity3 for the national championship of college basketball monday night , you can count on two things with absolute certainty : 1			2
the television ratings for @entity9 will fall somewhere within the range of really impressive to enormous			2
you will see commercials featuring famous professional athletes , doing their best to persuade you to purchase the products they are endorsing			2
which brings us to a seldom - questioned oddity about contemporary life : what do you think would happen if there was a highly publicized court case , and the defense lawyer asked the jury to acquit the defendant because of the emotional testimony of an eyewitness -- and the prosecutor announced that the witness had been paid a huge fee by the defense ? would the the jury have any faith in the witness ? the witness ' testimony would , with good reason , be considered worthless			1
or : how would you feel if you read an ecstatic movie review that made you want to run right down to the theater and buy a ticket -- and then it was reported that the reviewer had received a large check from the movie studio to make sure he gave the film a rave ? you 'd want your money back			1
you 'd realize that the review meant less than nothing			2
the reviewer 's opinion of the movie was based not on genuinely admiring it , but on being paid to make you think it was good			1
if it turned out that the critic was taking money to say he liked certain films , his days as a reviewer would be over			2
and it would n't matter if he swore to you that he truly enjoyed the movie , and that the money had nothing to do with it			1
what if a friend told you that you should go to an allegedly wonderful restaurant , and then you found out that he or she was being paid by the owner to send people there ? chances are that your enthusiasm would wane -- both for the restaurant , and for the friend			1
if someone accepts cash in exchange for offering a positive evaluation of something , then the evaluation must be tossed out			0
it 's worse than meaningless			0
yet in the arena of celebrity endorsements -- most notably , endorsements by prominent athletes -- not only is the public 's disbelief suspended , but people do n't seem to particularly care that the recommendation is bought and paid for			1
when i have tried over the years to make the case for the inherent undependability of these endorsements , people have said that yes , of course , that position is correct -- but that it does n't matter			1
when celebrities are paid to say they like something , studies show , it generally translates into increased sales for the companies that hire them			1
thus , when a stellar basketball player comes out of college , there is great speculation surrounding the question of what shoe company he will sell his name to , and at what price			0
bidding wars develop , and escalate ; often the competition is reported in the press , and the winning shoe company celebrates like a presidential candidate who has just found out he has passed the magic number of votes in the @entity120			0
same thing with soft - drink bottlers and energy - bar manufacturers and pain - relief purveyors			0
the companies know that nothing sells with the public -- and particularly the young male segment of the public -- like a smiling word of affirmation from a top - tier athlete			0
so one company raises its offer , to be topped by a competing company , to be topped again until there is only one company remaining			0
and that is when the athlete proclaims to the skies that this is the shoe / soda pop / anti-inflammatory strip that he loves best			0
you ca n't blame the athletes for taking the money			1
who would n't ? but at least once in a while , the rest of us may want to step back to consider that this is the kind of recommendation we should trust the least			1
and that conversely , in a sensible world , the only recommendations in which we should have any faith would be the ones for which athletes and celebrities were paid nothing at all			1
not that such an endorsement would ever happen			0
try to imagine a commercial that looks like this : an internationally renowned basketball star is shown in a perfectly framed piece of film footage			1
he is lighted heroically ; he glides down the court , slams home a dunk , turns to the camera and says : " i could n't have done it without my [ insert brand name of shoe or energy drink ]			1
and the funny thing is , they told me that they could n't pay me any money for this commercial			2
[ @entity177 name of competing shoe or competing energy drink ] offered me $ 40 million over 10 years to tell you that i like their [ shoe or energy drink ] , but the fact is i like this [ shoe or energy drink ] better			0
that 's why i 'm telling you to buy it -- because i buy it , too , and with my own money			0
" the athlete would likely be declared clinically insane			0
the world does n't work that way			2
at least the sports endorsement world does n't			2
enjoy the game monday night			0
and the next time you 're following one of those televised trials , look at the star witness and think about just how much his testimony would be worth to someone			0
if only he could smash home runs or throw touchdown passes or hit three - pointers at the buzzer , he 'd be in business			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity212 .			1

@entity212 : celebrity endorsements are accepted as natural
he says people would n't have faith in film critics whose *praise* is paid for by movie studios
@entity212 : why put any *credence* in what a celebrity is paid millions to say ?
