@entity0 -- tensions between @entity0 residents and visitors from mainland @entity5 ratcheted up wednesday , after a full - page advertisement decrying a so - called invasion of " locusts " from across the border appeared in a local newspaper			1
the advertisement in the @entity12 asks if @entity13 approve of spending hk $ 1,000,000 ( us $ 128,925 ) every 18 minutes to take care of children borne by mainland parents and declares that " @entity0 people have had enough ! " picturing a giant locust perched atop a mountain overlooking @entity0 , the ad invokes the locally - coined locust label used to describe mainlanders , reflecting a concern among some residents in @entity0 that mainland @entity25 are " taking over " the city			1
a surge in the number of pregnant @entity25 women crossing into @entity0 to give birth has put a growing burden on the resources of local hospitals			1
according to the @entity38 , the number of live births in @entity0 by mainland mothers went from 26,838 in 2006 to 40,875 in 2010 -- a 52 % increase			1
on tuesday , @entity41 official said in a radio interview that public hospitals may ban mainland mothers to ensure that local pregnant women can be accommodated			1
this follows a decision last year by @entity47 , @entity48 , to cap the number of non-local women giving birth in the city in 2012 at 35,000			2
in addition to the perception of better medical services , many mainland women choose to give birth in @entity0 so their children can gain the right of abode and other privileges conferred by a @entity0 identity card			1
of the 41.9 million visitors to @entity0 in 2011 , the majority -- more than 28 million -- hailed from mainland @entity5 , according to the @entity63			2
wednesday 's advert was organized by internet users , who raised more than us $ 12,000 within a week , according to the @entity66			0
" [ @entity67 ] have already crossed our bottom line , " organizer @entity70 , told the @entity66			0
" why are mainland mothers flooding in to take up resources in public hospitals , getting our benefits and social welfare ? why do mainlanders ... refuse to follow our rules and order ? we ca n't accept that			1
" the ad comes after a series of incidents in recent weeks that point to a growing resentment among locals , with some critics suggesting this is due to a deeper unease and anxiety over @entity91 's degree of influence in local affairs and @entity0 's autonomy within the " one country , two systems " that took effect after the city 's handover to @entity91 in 1997			1
" the greatest fear @entity0 people have is @entity0 becoming just one more city in @entity5 , " @entity101 anthropologist @entity100 told @entity102 last week			2
in december , a row between locals and mainland visitors on a city train was caught on video and widely circulated online			0
the prolonged yelling match , sparked when an local man became incensed by a woman who had disobeyed the no - eating rules and ended up spilling food on seats , led passengers to press the emergency button			0
another incident occurred last month outside a @entity120 in @entity0 when shop staff were accused of discriminating against locals by preventing them from taking pictures , while mainland tourists and other foreigners were reportedly allowed to do so			2
in @entity5 , reaction to the newspaper ad on micro-blogging site @entity127 ranged from indignation from sadness			2
" if you are independent enough , then do n't use resources from the mainland ! " wrote a user named lan - tong			0
@ pqdexiaoxi pointed out that @entity13 have provided the mainland with flood disaster relief several times over the past decades			0
" i believe many mainlanders are very grateful , but the advertisement hurts our feelings			0
" @ bingjilinjiezhi said : " as parents , we all hope to find better living conditions for our children			0
why should that be criticized ? "			0
