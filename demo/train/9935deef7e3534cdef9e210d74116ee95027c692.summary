@entity0 -- long before people posted their thoughts and feelings on social networking sites like @entity7 and @entity8 , millions of people were doing just that on a different sort of wall			1
it might have been something as simple as a baseball , a playing card or a walking stick			1
or perhaps a more personal item , like a poem , photograph or diploma			2
and then there 's the occasional letter , like the one dated november 18 , 1989 , that began : dear sir , for twenty two years , i have carried your picture in my wallet			2
i was only eighteen years old that day that we faced each other on that trail in @entity30 , @entity31			2
why you did not take my life , i will never know			2
... these are among the more than 100,000 objects that have been left at the @entity36 on the @entity37			1
since its dedication in 1982 , nearly 4 million people a year have visited the memorial 's polished black granite wall , many to leave a personal item or note in memory of the more than 58,000 people whose names are engraved there			2
no one is sure who started the custom of leaving items at the wall , curator @entity49 said			2
the first items began showing up even before construction on the memorial was complete			2
a park ranger started collecting the items , thinking people might come back for them someday			0
by 1986 , as the objects continued to pile up , the @entity61 decided to establish an official collection			1
thus was born the @entity64			0
the items are catalogued 12 miles away at the @entity67 facility in @entity68			0
though it 's not open to the public , traveling collections are often on display at museums both in the @entity74 and abroad , @entity49 said			1
" you had , for the first time that we 've been able to ascertain , people coming to a public site for a protracted period and leaving unsolicited objects , " @entity49 said			1
there is seemingly no limit to the types of artifacts that are part of the collection , from @entity88 action figures to crutches , dog tags , combat boots -- even a motorcycle			1
on any given day , the wall might be adorned with artwork , prayers , a diploma marking a missed milestone or a picture of a young child born too late for a loved one to meet			0
occasionally , a note accompanies an item , but most times an object 's meaning is left to interpretation			1
@entity49 , a @entity31 veteran himself , says he 's wary of making assumptions about an item 's meaning			0
many may seem like ordinary objects , but often they hold deeper significance to either the donor or one being remembered			1
@entity49 likes to use a bag of @entity114 to make his point			0
the candy , which gained popularity among @entity119 soldiers looking for a chocolate treat that would n't melt , may have been left at the wall because it was a loved one 's favorite , he says			1
more likely , though , it had something to do with the little - known fact that military doctors used @entity114 as placebos for injured soldiers when no aspirin was available			0
" i look at us as being voyeurs in many ways , because we do n't know the full story , " he said			0
" outside of donor information , i ca n't tell you why [ an ] item was left			1
" on a more comprehensive scale , the collection serves as a record of social history , he said			1
the egalitarian nature of the memorial and the unprecedented public outrage that resulted from the controversial war are not unrelated , @entity49 said			0
" this is a study			0
this is tangible evidence of a major epoch on the psyche of the @entity74 public , " @entity49 said			1
" for all intents and purposes , this collection is being curated by the public			1
" and as @entity31 veterans age , it even more important to preserve these artifacts for future generations , he said			0
" almost 60 percent of today 's population was not alive during @entity31 , " he said			0
" you ca n't tell where you are until you understand where you 've been			0
... we 're preserving the past for the future			0
