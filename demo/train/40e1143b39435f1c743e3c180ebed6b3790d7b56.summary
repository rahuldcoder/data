-- by now you 've either heard about or read @entity3 's controversial column on the issue of sexual assault on college campuses			1
@entity3 's take is that the numbers are " preposterous " and using " simple arithmetic " he can prove the " supposed campus epidemic of rape " just ai n't so			1
worse , @entity3 believes that progressivism , the @entity15 administration , a college hook - up culture and shady math are turning survivors of sexual assault into a " coveted status that confers privilege			1
" he goes on to claim that efforts to address the issue on campuses is " making everyone hypersensitive , even delusional , about victimizations			0
" i 'd no more want to have a conversation with @entity3 about sexual assault on college campuses than i wish to discuss racism with @entity31			1
both men are shockingly out of touch with reality			2
the fact is , @entity3 is so wrong			2
@entity3 argues that " @entity39 " and " progressivism " are to blame for creating a " supposed " epidemic of campus rape			2
colleges prefer to sweep sexual assault cases under the rug , but students have brought the issue to light			1
in 2011 , 16 @entity47 students and alumni filed a @entity50 sexual assault complaint against the university			1
other similar lawsuits emerged across the nation			0
as of this moment , there are 55 universities and colleges under investigation by the federal government			0
when @entity60 ( my alma mater ) was confronted with the problem , the university experienced an astounding 14 % drop in college applications			0
unlike @entity3 , the president of @entity60 , @entity66 , hit it head on : " from sexual assaults on campus ... to a culture where dangerous drinking has become the rule and not the exception ... to a general disregard for human dignity as exemplified by hazing , parties with racist and sexist undertones , disgusting and sometimes threatening insults hurled on the @entity71 ... to a social scene that is too often at odds with the practices of inclusion that students are right to expect on a college campus in 2014			1
the actions i have detailed are antithetical to everything that we stand for and hope for our students to be			0
there is a grave disconnect between our culture in the classroom and the behaviors outside of itâ € ” behaviors which too often seek not to elevate the human spirit , but debase it			0
@entity3 suggests that women , hook - up culture , alcohol , anything but men , are to blame			2
he cites an example of a student from @entity108 in 2013 and condenses her report into two paragraphs -- as if it 's representative of most sexual assault cases			1
is he trying to find a way to blame women ? women who drink			0
women who say no and fall asleep			0
are they giving up their right to say no if they pass out or fall asleep ? what about the morality of the man 's actions ? what respectable young man rolls himself on top of a drunk , sleepy corpse of a woman and forces her to have sex , after she had said no ? take 25 seconds and watch this brilliant @entity131 on what a guy should do if he finds himself with a woman passed out , asleep on his couch , or in his bed			0
it 's really simple and there 's no gray area or ambiguity : good guys respect women			2
creeps and criminals take advantage of women			0
by addressing the problems , colleges are turning sexual assault victims into a " coveted status			1
" ask any woman who 's been the victim of a sexual assault , unwanted groping , or date rape and you 'll learn there 's nothing to covet			1
and most definitely it 's not a privilege			0
dr. @entity161 , who wrote an open letter to @entity3 , offers a powerful first - hand perspective that will tell you what goes through the mind of a rape survivor			2
victims often feel shame , guilt and fear			0
when they try to report it , they 'll be questioned about their conduct , whether there 's any drinking involved , what they were wearing , whether they 've had sex with the man before			0
if it 's serious enough and not a " micro-aggression " the attacker might be quietly punished , in a way that makes sure that no parents find out			0
but the victim has to deal with whispers and rumors			0
the simple arithmetic does n't make @entity3 's point powerful			1
@entity3 makes a big stink about whether it 's true that " one in five women " could possibly be sexually assaulted during college			1
i could make arguments to counter his math. but let 's do this : what if we say there are " only " one in 20 women who are sexually assaulted , rather than one in five ? does that make this problem less of a problem ? are those women who are raped less deserving of help ? if armed robberies on campus happened to one in 20 , or one in 20 students got the measles or food poisoning , we would call it an epidemic			1
simply focusing on the validity of the numbers is not a way to invalidate the obligation and importance of universities taking this problem seriously			0
" i take sexual assault more seriously than you do			1
" in his response to the backlash , @entity3 pulled out the @entity31 " i 'm not a racist and i 've never been a racist " defense			2
he says , " i think i take sexual assault much more seriously than you do			1
which is why i worry about definitions of that category of crime that might , by their breadth , tend to trivialize it			0
" actually , it 's @entity3 who 's trivializing the problem			2
when he summarizes a single story of sexual assault with a giant incredulous eye roll and suggests that a woman 's conduct should be scrutinized more than a man 's in assessing whether a sexual assault even occurred -- he is trivializing a creepy and criminal act			1
the reason why so many women have n't come forward until now is because victims assumed nothing would happen , or even worse , they 'd face someone like @entity3 who 'd put the blame right back on the victim .			2

@entity255 : @entity3 's views about sexual assault on campuses are wrong
@entity260 : he 's out of touch with reality , trivializes the problem , and blames women
colleges tried to sweep assault cases under the rug , but students complained
@entity260 : women who are assaulted are victims , not *people* with " coveted status "
