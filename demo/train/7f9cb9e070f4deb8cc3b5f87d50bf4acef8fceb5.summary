-- @entity1 , a recent university graduate in @entity3 , is young , @entity4 and frustrated			1
young muslims , pictured here in @entity6 , are increasingly using technology to engage the world			1
the 23 - year - old says the complexity of who she is as a @entity4 is being distorted by extremists and the media coverage of them			1
channeling her frustration , she started @entity15 , a web site she describes as a place for young people in the region to " show a different side of our religion " and discuss topics big and small , taboo and not			1
she represents a generation of @entity4 who are using technology to express themselves , connect with others , challenge traditional power structures and create an identity in an era when @entity30 extremists often grab the headlines			1
" i think the word that clearly defines the younger generation and also separates them from their parents is ' globalized , ' " said @entity32 , the author of two books on @entity30 , including the recently published " how to win a @entity34 : @entity40 , globalization and the @entity42			2
" access to technology lags in countries with large @entity4 populations compared with @entity47 and the @entity48			1
access also varies between those countries depending on a variety of factors such as governmental control and economic development			2
but the numbers of people using the @entity56 and cell phones are growing -- and quickly			1
" the percentage increases of @entity59 users in places like @entity61 , @entity62 and @entity63 are astronomical during the past five years , " @entity32 said			2
a recent study by @entity65 predicted growth rates for web usage would continue to soar in the region during the next five years			2
a battle over interpretation @entity71 , who spoke to @entity0 by phone from @entity3 , said her @entity30 identity was partly shaped by a childhood that included @entity77 classmates and @entity48 and @entity79 teachers			2
she also grew up in a country that was relatively progressive enough to appoint a female @entity83 ambassador recently			2
" @entity30 is much more relaxed here , " she said			2
" but it does n't mean we 're not good @entity4			1
" she discovered blogs , and the more she read , the more she grew frustrated with the nature of the dialogue			2
" no one was talking to each other , " she said			2
the conflict between @entity93 and @entity94 in 2006 was the turning point for her			2
" i was really annoyed by how the @entity97 and @entity98 media were covering it , " she said			2
" both sides were sticking to the extremes			2
" she said she started her web site that year to provide the world -- and media -- a different perspective on @entity30			0
" we 're not as simplistic as the media would often make of us , " she said			1
@entity71 said the web site 's discussion subjects range from the political to the taboo , including homosexuality , premarital sex and atheism			0
the anonymity provided by the @entity56 helps foster such discussion , she said			1
she is , however , careful to avoid talking about some topics , which could get her in trouble			0
" i always remind myself that i have my limitations , " she said			0
" there are various issues that i am unable to tackle for security reasons			0
" @entity71 said she hopes that web sites such as hers could help fight extremist @entity30 groups by defeating their arguments through cultural and religious dialogue			0
but she concedes there 's catching up to do			0
" we have to move faster " because extremist groups are more widespread in traditional media such as newspapers and radio stations , which are still consumed by more people than new media such as web sites , she said			0
the extremists ' lure some extremists are adept at using technology and new media as well			0
the killings of journalist @entity142 , @entity48 businessman @entity143 and @entity144 , an @entity48 contractor working in @entity146 , were all recorded and later broadcast on the @entity56			1
it 's long been a concern that the @entity56 is being used by extremist groups such as @entity150 to recruit young @entity4 to their cause			1
however , @entity152 , who co-authored recent studies of the @entity155 and @entity156 blogospheres at @entity158 's @entity157 , said he found little evidence of such activity			0
" in the @entity155 blogosphere we found no specific clusters related to extremism , and when it was discussed , it tended to be in negative terms , " he said			0
" it was a counter-narrative we were surprised to find			0
" there are several possible reasons why , he explained			0
it 's difficult for extremist groups to maintain a static presence on the @entity56 -- they constantly have to move to avoid being found			1
additionally , popular sites such as @entity174 have strict terms of usage , which make it difficult for extremist groups -- and their sympathizers -- to build a following			0
@entity32 , who is also the executive editor of the social - networking web site @entity180 , said that research has consistently shown that the @entity59 is not an effective recruiting tool for extremists			0
he said extremist groups use the @entity56 more as a marketing and communication tool			1
" nobody , absolutely nobody , straps a bomb on their body because they were recruited from the @entity59 , " he said			0
" it takes an enormous amount of personal face - to - face contact and time in order to recruit a young person into the cause of jihad			1
" the @entity56 and the streets observers say that like other young people around the world , @entity4 mostly use technology such as cell phones and the web for social and recreational reasons , not political			1
@entity206 traveled through the @entity207 from 2004 through 2006 for his book , " @entity209 : a @entity211 @entity48 's @entity210			0
" he joined the @entity213 in september , 2006			0
he said his travels showed him that the same tools young @entity4 are using to socialize also are helping them organize			1
while at an underground party in @entity61 a few years ago , he asked the @entity61 how they heard about the gathering			0
they told him that if he were to go to the marketplace during the day and turn on his bluetooth , he could receive random messages with details on where to go and at what time			0
western - style parties and music are prohibited in @entity61 , so young people hold them secretly to evade security			1
@entity206 said the partygoers were dismissive when asked if they were afraid of the security forces finding out			0
" no one over 30 knows what @entity219 does , " the young @entity61 told him			1
that knowledge and tech savviness played a significant role in the recent protests after the disputed @entity61 election			0
protesters used @entity237 , cell phones and other social - networking tools to organize and spread word of what was happening on the streets			1
the impact on @entity30 : a new identity ? the post-election fallout in @entity61 is one example that portends a broader generational and hierarchical struggle in the @entity249 , some experts say			2
there are a lot of young @entity4			1
by some estimates , about 60 percent of @entity4 in the @entity207 are under the age of 30			1
" what the printing press is to @entity77 in the 16th century , that 's what the @entity59 is doing to @entity30 now , " @entity32 said			0
" it has opened up the monopoly over the interpretation of @entity30 that used to solely belong to the religious class			0
" some clerical authorities , well aware of the challenges posed to their influence by the powers of the @entity56 , are becoming more tech savvy and are building a digital presence , @entity32 says			1
but their interpretations and authority increasingly have competition from sites created by young @entity4 such as @entity1 and online communities found on @entity174 and @entity237			1
however , emerging technology also could be a force that helps forge a new , more global @entity30 identity			0
@entity277 @entity4 can now talk to @entity4 in @entity62 , @entity278 , the @entity48 or @entity47			1
" during the 20th century , the parents of this generation were struggling to define for themselves some conception of a @entity283 or pan-muslim unity , " @entity32 said			0
" but that was elusive because there are so many things geopolitically that separate the @entity4 world			1
" with the @entity59 , those boundaries , those borders are irrelevant			0

the number of young @entity4 using the @entity56 is rising , experts say
they 're using it to express themselves and connect with others
these tools also are providing a way to organize socially and politically
