@entity0 -- what could bring together the biggest names in the @entity5 pop industry ? a visit by the @entity7 will do it			1
as pope @entity10 tours @entity5 through august 18 , some 20 @entity5 household names got together to record a video for a song titled " @entity13 , " which means camaraderie and communion in @entity16			1
it was composed by k - pop veteran @entity19 - shim to celebrate the first papal visit to @entity5 in 25 years			1
some 5.4 million @entity21 are @entity22 -- roughly 10 % of the population -- and amongst them are pop stars and actors			1
figure skating star @entity26 is also a follower of the faith and one of the celebs expected to appear at official functions during the @entity7 's visit			1
during a recent tv appearance , she had appealed to the @entity7 to bless @entity5 and " provide messages of hope			1
" unfortunately for fans , she does not appear in the new music video			1
@entity38 worship despite involving some serious pop star power , the video for " @entity13 " is devoid of the typical trappings of a k - pop music video			1
there 's no tightly choreographed dancing or thematic costumes			2
instead , director @entity46 has the famous faces hidden behind sheet music , huddled together like a devout church choir			1
it 's a far cry from @entity46 's previous work , such as the " @entity55 " video starring @entity53 and @entity54			1
" when i called everyone they were extremely happy to be part of the music video , and those who could not make it were extremely regretful , " said veteran actor @entity56 , who helped organize the project			1
@entity56 has been at the forefront of several cultural projects that support religious causes , such as narrating a biopic about the life of cardinal @entity69 , the country 's first catholic cardinal and a much respected figure amongst religious and secular groups			1
devoted diva the number of @entity22 in @entity5 continues to grow , with roughly 100,000 baptisms per year			1
the baptism du jour is that of pop star rain ( aka			2
local media widely reported that his actress girlfriend @entity82 inspired the conversion , and the celebrity rumor mill spelled an impending marriage			0
rain 's agency @entity87 has rejected the claim : " rain has indeed been baptized , but this is something he has been meaning to do for some time now			2
it would be rash to make assumptions about engagement plans			0
" rain 's girlfriend @entity96 , who rose to international stardom through tv soaps such as @entity100 , is outspoken on religious beliefs			0
she had espoused premarital chastity through press interviews early on in her career and continues to make statements on religion through the media			0
@entity5 celebrities are far from shy when it comes to expressing their faith , and actors and singers frequently pay religious tributes while making award acceptance speeches onstage			2
pop singers including @entity116 of @entity117 , @entity118 of @entity119 and @entity120 have been open about being @entity121 , as have popular actors @entity122 , @entity124 and @entity125 - won			2
" @entity5 celebrities convey their religiosity much more openly than their political views			2
they have been more outspoken and proactive since the 1980s as religion became increasingly secularized here , " said culture critic @entity128			0
strong resonation @entity133 celebrities have often been more vocal than their @entity121 counterparts , and many are part of well - known church gatherings			0

" these groups are not only for @entity152 studies and prayer , but also for carrying out volunteer work and networking			0
it 's difficult for celebrities to socialize even if they are in show business together , and mutual religious views often become a strong basis for building friendship or even romance , " said an industry insider who asked to remain anonymous			0
@entity164 of @entity146 has been reported to have met her actor boyfriend @entity165 through @entity143			0
meanwhile , celebrities are posting welcome messages for @entity10 on social media networks			0

i pray you can safely wrap up the four - night , five - day trip and that you can inspire youths across the world with visionary messages			0
" " pope @entity10 is particularly respected for making socially meaningful statements , which are resonating strongly among even @entity181			0
this is largely due to the prevailing sense of anxiousness and mistrust here following recent traumatic events , " culture critic @entity96 said , referring to a ferry sinking earlier this year that left hundreds dead .			0
