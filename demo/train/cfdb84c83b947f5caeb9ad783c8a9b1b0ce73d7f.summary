@entity0 -- the @entity2 , the @entity3 , @entity4 , the @entity5 , @entity6 -- rock music 's history is littered with bands marred by messy breakups			2
even spending three decades on the road together seems no barrier to disharmony , as @entity14 and his former @entity16 bandmates are finding out			1
the musicians are now exchanging bitter words in public while fighting in court over who owns the right to use the @entity16 name			1
@entity14 compares the situation to a bitter divorce ; singer and guitarist @entity26 says the bass player 's decision to perform the band 's early material on tour is " disrespectful			1
" " this is quite a unique way of arguing ... this fracas now of arguing over the trademark , " @entity14 tells @entity1 by telephone			1
" none of this ' namby - pamby sitting around a table and sorting it out , ' we want to do it all in public			0
" @entity16 was formed in 1980 by @entity26 , @entity14 and drummer @entity43 , who had previously been in melancholy post-punk band @entity44 until the death of singer @entity46			1
along with keyboardist @entity48 they went on to break new ground by combining northern guitar music with synthesizers , and later dance rhythms			0
the group 's 1983 single " @entity56 " remains the biggest - selling 12 - inch disc in @entity55 chart history			2
@entity14 left in 2007 , claiming it would be impossible for @entity16 to make music without him			1
however , @entity26 , @entity43 and @entity60 reformed four years later without him and are now touring and planning to release new material under the @entity16 name			1
the bassist says he has raw feelings about his exclusion			0
" i was n't even told they were reforming , " he says			0
" i just got a cryptic message to listen to the radio at 1pm on the monday when it was announced			0
it 's like being divorced and getting shown the door without even being told why			2
" for his part , @entity26 has laid into hook , saying that the bassist was affected badly after being treated for alcoholism			1
" when he came out of treatment for this event , he was a worse person , in my opinion , " the guitarist told the now - defunct @entity76			0
" he tore strips off me and said everything that had ever gone wrong with @entity16 was my fault ; everyone was really puzzled ... and then he just started attacking everyone else -- the management -- everyone was 's * * * ' except him			1
" the singer also said he was saddened by his former bandmate 's lack of interest in @entity16 , and @entity14 confirmed that a reunion seemed unlikely			1
" will we get back together ? at the moment we 're at the stage when , if you 're getting divorced , your wife 's cutting the dog in half and tearing all the sleeves off your suits ... so the answer would have to be no. " @entity14 likens the dispute to four people who run a shop for 30 years together			1
" then one day you came along and the others have locked you out			0
they 're inside still selling without your knowledge and consent			0
how would you feel ? " warming to his theme , the 57 - year - old poses the question : " why was i locked out of the shop ? it obviously has to do with the fact that i resurrected the @entity44 music			0
but they resurrected it first when they played as @entity118 ( the band name @entity26 performed under between 2008 and 2011 ) without asking me			1
it 's do as i say , not as i do			2
" but anyone has the right to play @entity44			0
i ca n't stop a busker playing ' @entity56 ' ; i might have an opinion about it , but i ca n't stop him			2
" @entity14 's new band @entity127 is playing two dates in the @entity129 this week , performing the first two @entity16 albums , 1981 's " movement " and " @entity133 " from 1983 in their entirety			1
the divorce metaphor never far away , he says playing the older material is like " getting the kids for the weekend after a particularly nasty split			0
it 's nice to get the songs back			0
" " ' movement ' is a very @entity44 record with @entity16 vocals , whereas by the time " @entity133 " came along , it was a proper @entity16 record			1
on " movement , " ( producer ) @entity145 played the vocals down a lot , so it 's nice with the experience i have now , to be able to really belt it out properly			0
" on previous tours @entity14 's group played the two @entity44 albums , material @entity16 rarely performed			1
" i 'm celebrating the @entity44 thing that @entity16 made a conscious decision to ignore -- and were right to ignore			2
but once @entity16 split up and i was on the outside , you start thinking , hang on a minute everyone revered @entity44			2
the only people who do n't celebrate it were the people who were in @entity44			0
" @entity14 acknowledges the name of his old band is far better known to fans than that of his new one , so the legal battle over who owns the trademark is not just a matter of pride			1
" i 'm trying to establish my name , " he says			0
" but if you 're talking about a group like @entity16 that has an established brand and trademark , then yes , you make much more off live performances now than you do off recording			2
" and it 's the @entity180 phenomenon			0
no one wants to hear your new stuff anyway , they want to hear your old stuff			0
