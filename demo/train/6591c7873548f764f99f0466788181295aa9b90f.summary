-- the death last month of a 53 - year - old former investment banker who collapsed in an @entity5 courtroom , minutes after a jury found him guilty of torching his palatial @entity8 estate , appears to have been a suicide , police said tuesday			1
@entity10 was facing a sentence of seven to 21 years in prison on june 28 when courtroom video shows that he appeared to put something into his mouth and swallowed			1
minutes later , he appeared to put something else into his mouth , and again swallowed			0
shortly afterward , he went into convulsions and was taken to @entity18 , where he was pronounced dead			1
late monday or early tuesday , @entity20 's adult son received a delayed e-mail from his father " telling him that if things do n't go good in court , @entity20 's wills are in place and his car can be found at a @entity31 location , " @entity18 sheriff @entity23 told reporters			1
the family relayed that information to police , who searched the car 's cargo area and found a canister labeled sodium cyanide , he said			1
investigators determined that @entity10 had ordered the quick - acting poison -- typically used in agriculture and gold mining -- from a @entity45 - based company and that it was delivered by @entity46 to his home in 2011			1
" all indications point to suicide but , until the final report , this case still remains open , " he said			0

" we assume that @entity10 made capsules out of this toxic substance before coming to court on june 28 , " he said			1

he described the family as " very distraught , " but cooperating with investigators			0
during his career working for @entity70 investment banks , the @entity67 graduate had collected @entity72 artwork , driven a @entity73 and flew his own plane			0

and he hit a brick wall			0
" @entity10 's brick wall proved to be his 10,000 square - foot home in the @entity86 , an exclusive enclave in @entity8			1
@entity10 bought the house in 2008 , as the real estate market was collapsing , with an interest - only mortgage payment of $ 17,250 per month			1

but @entity103 , the forensic accountant who unraveled @entity10 's personal finances for investigators , told @entity0 it was all a ploy			1
doctors feared mass suicide after deadly ' sweat lodge , ' survivor says " what happened was he paid $ 2,550,000 for the house and set up with a couple of friends of his a bogus second mortgage designed to increase the value of the house for $ 950,000 , a second mortgage that did n't really exist , " he said			2
@entity120 said the ploy was intended to make $ 1 million for @entity20 while also making him look as though he was helping charity			2

" yeah , you 're right , i find that odd			2
" speaking after the fire from his hospital bed , @entity10 recounted his improbable escape			1
" i realized that i actually had some air left in that tank , and that 's what enabled me to get back to the window and deploy that ladder , " he told a reporter			0
" if i had n't had those two things , we would n't be talking			0
" @entity142 says he found four locations in the house where fires had been intentionally set and a line of phone books that helped the fire spread			0
