@entity0 -- no @entity3 politician has ever aroused admiration and respect like @entity6			1
but none has inspired the same level of fear and animosity			2
to her fans she was the @entity13 warrior - queen who vanquished both the " enemy within " -- the striking @entity16 coal miners led by @entity17 -- and the enemy without -- gen. @entity21 's @entity20 force that invaded the @entity22 in 1982			2
she was the country 's only female prime minister , and the first to win three general elections in a row			1
@entity26 : @entity3 's divisive " @entity27 " dead at 87 in @entity28 , @entity6 brushed aside all dissenting voices , and for a decade from 1979 she was indomitable			1
while the left feuded over how best to fight her government 's right - wing policies of austerity , privatization and laws to curb the labor unions , the only opposition with any bite came from comedians , satirists and musicians , all of whom pilloried the " @entity27 " and her ministers with wit , flare and fury			1
the polarized society that @entity3 became was encapsulated by the song " @entity52 , " by ska revivalists @entity51 , the haunting soundtrack of 1981 as riots erupted in @entity0 , @entity55 , @entity56 and @entity57			1
with a haunting melody , the song recounted how " this town 's becoming like a ghost town / @entity60 leaving the youth on the shelf			2
" the @entity66 - based band 's songwriter @entity64 said the no. 1 single was inspired by a loathing of @entity6			1
" that song was our political reflection on the situation in the 1980s , which was n't good , and that @entity6 's own policies had helped create			1
" i 'm proud to have put out songs opposed to her as she changed our country for the worse			2
@entity3 is no longer self - sufficient and we do n't pay our way in the world anymore			1
" a lot of musicians were happy to put their opinions into song , for example us , @entity83 and @entity84 , a trend that has n't happened since the time of @entity6			1
" @entity87 : many @entity3 never identified with @entity6 many other memorable protest songs followed : some , like " @entity52 " and @entity90 's " @entity89 , " were directly political in voicing opposition to the austerity and mass unemployment of the era ; others articulated a deep visceral hatred of the woman herself , as in @entity83 's " stamp the @entity98 " or " @entity99 " by @entity100			1
one music writer said @entity6 inspired so many angry young songwriters because she appeared to go out of her way to stir up confrontation			1
" she was such an oppositional figure , singling out certain enemies , for example the @entity20 junta , unions , travelers , people on benefits , the left wing in general , " said @entity105 , author of " @entity106 : a history of @entity117			1
" " she was unflinching and vicious in her attacks on them			2
there was a sense she was conducting a war on certain sections of society			2
she referred to the miners as ' the enemy within			2
' this just was not the way politicians talk about their citizens			2
( current @entity3 prime minister ) @entity133 does not do that ; @entity135 before @entity6 did not do that			1
that aspect enraged people because they felt she was treating them with rhetorical and political violence			0
that encouraged them to respond with their own violence			0
" world reaction : @entity145 calls @entity6 a " great lady " the songs that spewed from this disgust at @entity6 's policies and personality formed a strand of the decade 's best music , according to @entity105 , who says all the best music has been political in some way			1
" if you look at a list of the greatest songs ever , many of these will be political			0
' @entity169 , ' ( performed most famously by @entity170 ) ' @entity171 , ' ( @entity172 ) ' @entity164 , ' ( @entity165 ) ' @entity166 , ( @entity167 ) ' born in the @entity168 , ' ( @entity162 ) ' @entity161 ' ( @entity163 ) -- all were successful songs , but intensely political at the same time			0
" @entity6 was eventually deposed in 1990 by her fellow conservatives in @entity28 , not musicians , but that , according to @entity105 , misses the point of artistic expression : just as @entity181 's " @entity180 , " portraying the 1937 bombing of a @entity185 @entity184 town by @entity187 and @entity188 warplanes , did not end the @entity189 , it was important in expressing outrage and making a political point			1
" @entity192 can make people angry , can inform or inspire them			0
it can make them feel they 're not alone			0
it can make them feel better when they 're low			0
" @entity6 made an impression on pop culture in other fields , a new era of fashion , film , tv programs , style magazines and nightclubs was also flowing out of the punk rebellion of the previous decade			1
" there were just so many exciting things going on then , " @entity105 recalled			1
whether any of this artistic explosion was directly due to the @entity6 effect is debatable -- especially in light of her reported aversion to the arts -- but one commentator for a left - leaning publication believes that her philosophy was certainly echoed in the youth culture of the day , whether the hip young gunslingers agreed with her divisive politics or not			1
" the punks and their fellow - travellers had an anti-establishment , @entity228 , can - do attitude , " wrote @entity224 in the @entity225			0
" the feeling was one of fundamental discontinuity with the past			0
they shared with the @entity236 an overwhelming desire to break from the established order , and to make it all new , as the modernists had			0
" the fashion world also joined the protests against the @entity13 government 's policies			1
at one party in @entity247 in 1983 , @entity245 wore a t - shirt bearing the message : " 58 % do n't want @entity250 " ( referring to an opinion poll showing public opposition to the deployment of @entity168 nuclear - capable missiles to the @entity3 )			1
@entity245 recalls three decades later how fellow designer @entity255 tried to dissuade her from attending the official reception			1
" he said , ' why should we have a glass of wine with that murderess ? ' but i thought on impulse it was quite a good photo opportunity , so we knocked up a t - shirt that afternoon and i wore it to the party			0
opinion : why @entity3 needs another @entity6 " @entity6 was n't very happy and was quite rude			1
she told me : ' we do n't have @entity250 here , we have cruise ( missiles )			0
i think you 've got the wrong party			0
' i thought this was rather rude because she invited me in the first place			0
i stayed at the party though ! " @entity245 agrees that the arts did blossom during that era , but believes it had little to do with the " destructive " politician herself			1
" she was appalling , " said @entity245			1
" she did nothing for the arts			2
@entity6 used to design her own frumpy clothes			1
i do n't know if she would have made a better fashion designer than a prime minister , but it would n't have been hard			1
" we did well in the ' 80s			0
we produced some of the best designers in the world , because of our clothing culture and the fact we 're more liberal with our children			0
they can go to school in ' @entity299 ' outfits if they want			0
we did produce good designers , regardless of @entity6			1
" humor was another field that boomed in direct response to @entity6			1
so - called " alternative comedians " on tv and in clubs took a sharp left turn away from the routines of their more reactionary predecessors , with many of the newcomers poking fun at the po - faced prime minister			1
the most biting of all was " @entity316 , " a satirical puppet show broadcast on sunday evenings on @entity318 from 1984 until 1996 that pilloried public figures , especially @entity6 , whom the program often portrayed as an insane megalomaniac			2
@entity323 , who with @entity324 designed the caricature puppets for the show , said the purpose of the show was to lance a bubble every week , and to educate @entity3 about what the government was doing in their name			2
" @entity6 was one of the main reasons we did ' @entity316 ' -- i knew why i was doing it and i would have killed my mother to have done it , " he said			2
" i knew what she was about and what she intended to do , things such as the mindless thuggery of the @entity341			0
" law , who now divides his time between @entity347 and @entity348 , said he and his colleagues tried various ways to portray the pm			0
" the puppets were just heightened versions of reality , so there were three @entity6 : one that talked to you as if your dog had died ; one that shouted at you and a foaming - at - the - mouth one			2
there never really was a smiley @entity6			2
what would be the point ? " in one famous scene set in a restaurant , a waiter asks @entity6 , who is treating her ministers to a meal , what she would like to eat : " steak , raw please , " comes the reply			2
" and what about the vegetables ? " asks the waiter			0
" oh , they 'll have the same as me			0
" the scene mocks @entity6 's cabinet colleagues as being weak and ineffectual , and while @entity323 admits he was worried about glorifying @entity6 , he said he tried to be fair to both sides			1
" we dished out the same stick to everybody , including ( opposition leader @entity383 , but at least we tried to get it right			0
" @entity6 left @entity3 in a worse situation than before she came to power , @entity323 believes			1
" i believe she had a strong effect on what happened here			0
she threw a lot of people to the dogs and you 're seeing now what she actually did			0
i 'm still angry about that now			0
" when you think of how our parents worked , when you could go to the doctor without thinking about the money			0
people like myself got half an education			0
i went to art school from a working class background without qualifications simply because i had some talent			0
all of that has gone , and you know that was her aim			0
it 's what she wanted			2
" i do n't have any answers like lots of other critics			0
but take a look around you			0
the people who came after inherited the mantle of @entity6 : her heirs ... the bitch she left behind was @entity427 ... and now we have a huge underclass			1
give up on consensus politics , and the notion of educating everybody properly			0
@entity433 ' em , basically			0
