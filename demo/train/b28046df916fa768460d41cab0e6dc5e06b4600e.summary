-- the circus has come to town and the villagers are in a frenzy			2
the light fantastic opening , the displays of super-human strength , the heroes born under the united roar of the crowd			2
who can deny the intoxicating beat of the @entity14 drum ? well , quite a few actually			1
was it really wise spending $ 14 billion in these times of austerity ? surely it was heavy - handed to install missiles on residents ' rooftops ? the recruitment shambles involving security company @entity23 suggested embarrassing unpreparedness ? yet it seems from the moment @entity28 took us on a whimsical journey through @entity32 history in the opening ceremony , that cynicism has melted away			1
opposing voices , which a year ago appeared the norm , are now labeled killjoys and whingers			2
even @entity39 mayor @entity38 told them to " put a sock in it " and support the greatest sporting show on earth			1
but those skeptical voices continue to murmur , with not everyone falling under the @entity14 spell			1
this charming man " has @entity50 ever been so foul with patriotism ? " former @entity53 front man @entity52 asked during the @entity54			1
the flags draped over the shoulders of sobbing medalists were nothing short of " blustering jingoism " in the @entity32 rocker 's eyes			1
those moments that had us gathered in fervor around the water cooler -- @entity68 ' record medal haul , @entity69 's historic 100m and 200m runs , gold after gold for @entity72 -- were positively perverse , according to the 1980s rock icon			2
" it is lethal to witness			2
as @entity39 is suddenly promoted as a super-wealth brand , the @entity50 outside @entity39 shivers beneath cutbacks , tight circumstances and economic disasters , " he said			1
" meanwhile the @entity32 media present 24 - hour coverage of the " dazzling royals " , laughing as they lavishly spend , as if such coverage is certain to make @entity32 society feel fully whole			2
" the other olympics part of the reasoning behind the @entity14 torch route was to make @entity32 feel part of the @entity54			1
but as it made its way from @entity94 to the stadium in @entity96 , another very different flame was winding across @entity39			1
the @entity97 , passed on from protesters at the @entity99 , arrived at @entity100 in @entity101 to a small gathering of demonstrators			2
the homemade cone bore the banner " @entity106 " and represented " hope for all those for whom the @entity14 has become a symbol of repression , eviction , greed and arrogance , " according to organizers @entity115			1
this was not the flame accompanied by @entity118 on a speed boat and sprinted into the roaring @entity120 before a television audience of 900 million			2
" i 'm sure there will be a lot of euphoria during the @entity54			0
but when the tv is n't showing images of people winning medals it will be a very different story			0
" @entity131 , spokesman for @entity132 told @entity0			0
" it claims to deliver lots of things such as tourists , inspiring people to take up sport , regenerating east @entity39			1
but that 's not the case			0
" people have lost their homes , others have gone to jail , local businesses are n't going to get anything out of this			1
" @entity131 has reason to be angry			0
in 2007 he was moved out of his home on the @entity150 in @entity151 , east @entity39 , to make way for the site of the @entity14			1
a tenant for 16 years , @entity131 now lives in social housing in neighboring borough @entity156			0
" some people did n't mind moving			0
but i 'd been living there since 1991			0
i was happy there , " he said			0
jailhouse rock now the impressive @entity163 is finally built , it is easy to forget what was on the site before			0
but the compulsory use of land has been a sore point for some east @entity169			0
in april protesters camped for four weeks outside the building site of a temporary basketball court in nearby @entity173 , @entity101			0
the demonstration finally ended in a standoff with police , with four of the protesters arrested and jailed for five days			0
one of them , 29 - year - old @entity179 , was handed an @entity180 ( @entity181 ) and ordered to not to go within 100m of any @entity14 venue or activity			1
" the local people were n't consulted about a site that 's very important to them , " said @entity179			0
" people walk their dogs there , run there , picnic there			0
it was almost like the @entity14 juggernaut created this thing that just had to be done at any cost			1
" despite his anger , @entity179 makes an important distinction between the athletes competing and the management of the @entity14			1
" there are moments i 've been caught up in the atmosphere			0
but let 's have an @entity14 that respects the community and leaves a lasting legacy			1
let 's have an equitable games that 's more than just a television experience , " he added			2
brand @entity211 it is a sentiment shared by former @entity14 sustainability commissioner , @entity213 , who quit her role earlier this year after @entity215 was awarded a major sponsorship deal -- including a fabric wrap around the stadium			1
campaigners argue @entity215 holds responsibility for the 1984 @entity222 disaster in @entity223 , in which at least 15,000 people died in a gas leak -- a claim which the company denies			0
@entity215 bought @entity228 -- the company which ran the pesticide plant -- 16 years after the disaster and argues it has no responsibility for @entity222			0
but for @entity213 , the evidence was too damming to ignore			0
" i think the @entity14 belong to all of us -- it 's supposed to be about celebrating our common humanity			1
but when you look at the sponsors , i find it impossible to see how the @entity239 can square that with the ethics of these companies , " she said			0
shot down away from the @entity163 , @entity244 's looks out his kitchen window in east @entity39 to see anti-terrorist missiles perched on neighbors ' rooftops			1
perhaps unsurprisingly , @entity14 skepticism is still rife for people living beneath these constant reminders of diabolical terror			1
" the way the media is presenting the @entity14 as a success just is n't reflective , " said @entity244 , spokesman for @entity253			1
" when they change the concierge they consult you			0
but when they place weapons of mass destruction on top of your house there 's zero consultation			0
" boom times ? before the @entity54 started , @entity169 had been told to prepare back - up plans for getting into work , lest they be swallowed by the swarms of tourists clogging peak - hour tubes			2
likewise , businesses were assured of a recession - busting boom			2
but the capital has been eerily quiet as @entity169 fled on holiday and tourists appeared to side - step the @entity14 town			1
there will be a slight boost from the @entity54 -- the economy is expected to grow by 0.6 % immediately afterwards -- but the glow will fade			0
" once the games are over , the problems facing the @entity32 economy will still be there , " said @entity284 , @entity285 's chief @entity32 and @entity287 economist			2
he predicted ticket sales and a spurt in temporary work would help nudge the economy , but " gdp is likely to be only flat at best overall in 2012 , " added @entity294			0
and the economy could even take an extra hit from everyone watching the @entity14 on tv instead of working , he warned			1
well , not quite everyone .			0

as @entity211 comes to a close , not everyone has fallen under the @entity14 spell
@entity52 *criticized* the " blustering jingoism " of games
@entity39 residents moved from their homes , others gone to jail
promise of economic boom *largely* *unfulfilled*
