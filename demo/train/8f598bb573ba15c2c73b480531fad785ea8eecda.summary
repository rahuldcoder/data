the inescapable topic of peace between @entity9 and its @entity13 rivals was also on the agenda			1
@entity8 has accused international powers that reached a deal with @entity3 to curb its nuclear program of making a " historic mistake " that could put @entity9 in grave danger			1
the agreement calls for the easing of economic sanctions on @entity3 in exchange for increased inspections and limits on the country 's uranium enrichment program , which many international analysts fear is meant for military purposes			2
in public remarks after his private meeting with @entity8 , @entity6 said the @entity7 remains committed to @entity9 's security			1
" i ca n't emphasize enough that @entity9 's security in this negotiation is at the top of our agenda , " @entity6 said , according to pool reports			1
" and the @entity7 will do everything in our power to make certain that @entity3 's nuclear program -- a program of weaponization possibilities -- is terminated			1

" @entity6 also made another push for @entity9 - @entity13 peace talks thursday as he hopped between @entity57 and @entity58 to address grievances from both sides			1
he kicked off talks in july , but in november , both sides dug in to their decades - old trenches and passed around blame			0
" we have always known that this is a difficult , complicated road , and we understand that , " @entity6 said in remarks with @entity8			0
" i believe we are making some progress , and the parties remain committed to this task			0
they are meeting regularly , and they have also remained -- we have remained in very close touch with both leaders as we proceed down this road			0
" he also addressed peace after meeting with @entity77 president @entity76			0
" today , we discussed at great length issues of security in the region , security for the state of @entity9 , security for a future @entity84 , " @entity6 said			1
" and we , i think , made some progress in discussing some of the ideas that are on the table			0
we are not going to discuss these further publicly , but i will say that the goal here for everybody is a viable @entity13 state with the @entity13 people living side by side in peace with the state of @entity9 and with the people of @entity9			1
" earlier , @entity8 said that @entity9 is " ready for a historic peace " based on a two - state solution but that @entity9 's security needs must be respected , and finger - pointing that he said helped derail the earlier talks must end			1
" what we need is not grandstanding but understanding , " he said			0
@entity9 , @entity13 accusations in november , @entity8 accused the @entity13 of continuing to incite distrust of @entity9 and perpetuating an " artificial crisis " to avoid a real peace deal			1
palestinians shot back that it is @entity57 that has been sowing distrust , but the hottest issue remains the construction of thousands of jewish settlement units on the @entity115 and other land that @entity13 claim as theirs			0
it is the real source of the " deep crisis between the @entity13 and the @entity9 negotiations team , " a @entity13 official said			2
he accused @entity9 of falsely claiming that the @entity13 were willing to let construction go forward if @entity9 released more @entity13 from prisons			2
it 's a concession that @entity9 commonly makes in deals with the @entity13 leadership			1
it 's simply not true , the official said			0
" all settlements are illegal in the @entity115 and @entity57			0
" motivating players @entity6 has been toting along a gift bag to motivate the players			2
@entity13 are receiving economic stimulus from @entity132 , which is shelling out a $ 100 million contribution to a program to build new roads , water lines , schools and other infrastructure			0
the measure , called the @entity140 , is also expected to create jobs for the unemployed in the impoverished territory			0
the @entity7 has also tasked @entity7 gen. @entity143 to work up an assessment of @entity9 's security needs in the event of a comprehensive peace agreement , @entity6 said			1
