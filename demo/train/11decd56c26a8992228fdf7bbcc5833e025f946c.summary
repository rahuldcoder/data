the incessantly ringing phones , and the realization that someone is desperately trying to reach someone else who is now dead , short - circuits the psychological defenses first responders need to do their jobs , said @entity32 , a registered nurse who helps train them for the @entity34			2
four arrested in connection with deadly @entity22 nightclub fire " it starts ringing and it becomes an instant reminder that this person is human , that they have friends and family who care , " he said			1
it also leaves responders with an uneasy feeling they 're keeping a secret from the victim 's loved ones , @entity32 said			2
@entity32 first ran across the issue following the @entity15 shooting , in which a lone gunman , a student , killed 32 people			0
some first responders could n't get the sound of ringing cell phones out of their ears , psychologists @entity57 of @entity15 and @entity58 of @entity59 wrote in a follow up journal article			1
" as police and rescue workers removed the bodies of the deceased and evacuated the survivors , they reported haunting memories of cell phones ringing in body bags as parents and friends desperately called their loved ones			1
" @entity17 first responders dealt with the same issue when a commuter train collided with a freight train in 2008			0
be ready for emergency at a crowded public gathering hundreds of firefighters and other first responders flooded the scene , clawing through the mangled wreckage to get at the bodies of victims			1
all the while , @entity32 said , dozens of cell phones kept ringing			1
@entity19 police officer @entity87 spoke this month during a court hearing of entering a theater where 12 people died in that shooting rampage			0
the things he noticed : blood running down the steps and the sound of cell phones ringing			1
it was the same sunday night , when firefighters rushed through a hole punched into the wall of the @entity102 nightclub by people who had escaped the building after it caught on fire			1
they found dozens of bodies of club - goers who died of smoke inhalation			0
and they once again heard the sounds of ringing phones			2

one alone had 104 missed calls			0
hundreds of family and friends were desperately trying to reach loved ones who were at the nightclub in the @entity22 city of @entity122 when a fire swept through early sunday , killing at least 230 people and injuring hundreds more			1
@entity22 nightclub fire : ' like a war zone ' with bodies piled " it was a really complicated scene			1
a lot of smoke , a lot of shoes that were left , cell phones , because everybody tried to get out of there running , " @entity129 , a reporter for @entity0 affiliate @entity130 said			2
" while we were there , we saw the cell phones were ringing			1
it was parents , friends , trying to know about what was happening and nobody was answering			0
" few , if any , agencies have policies on what to do about the multitude of ringing phones police and firefighters frequently encounter at disaster scenes , @entity32 said			2
he said he tells trainees turning off the phones can help save their own sanity , but says some agencies could view the act as tampering with evidence			0
he favors policies that would allow responders to turn the phones off , but says most commanders have n't yet come to the same conclusion			2
" it 's a 21st century problem , " he said			0
but it 's an issue emergency agencies will have to deal with sooner or later , if the experience of first responders @entity32 has spoken to is any indication			0
" they do n't talk about it openly , but when you get them alone ... " @entity32 said , like the responders , leaving the rest unspoken			0
