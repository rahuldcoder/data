-- global wine production is booming with vineyards springing up everywhere from @entity3 to the @entity4 , @entity5 and @entity6			1
but when a recent report authored by @entity9 predicted a looming global wine shortage , vinophiles took to social media to express their dismay over the bleak news			1
the report stated that the international demand for wine outweighed production by 300 million cases in 2012 -- dropping to its lowest point in over 40 years			1
with worldwide consumption jumping by 1 % last year , the researchers concluded demand could overtake supply in the coming years pushing the price of wine up			2
as the viticulture chaos ensued , @entity27 's @entity26 ( @entity26 ) released their very own forecast report that countered @entity9 's analysis			2
while @entity9 's figures were n't incorrect , per se , their forecast did not take into account 2013 's production levels which actually show a return to 2006 production levels , a healthy state of production for the industry			1
what 's more -- @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity27 and @entity5 produced record wine levels in 2013			0
" it 's how you interpret those figures			0
for all intents and purposes , for those of us in the @entity54 who are consumers , no -- there is not going to be a wine shortage , " says @entity47 , editor - in - chief of @entity50 's @entity49 magazine			1
" the question is whether there is going to be a wine shortage for consumers in markets that are extremely price sensitive -- like parts of @entity64 -- because the cheaper wine that they drink will be diverted to bulk up wine that goes into big consumption markets			1
" @entity69 echoes the @entity26 report pointing to the significant increase in production in @entity74 countries like @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 and @entity78 and if vineyards from these areas could find stronger distribution avenues within the international market , there will be plentiful bottles to go around			2
with poor wine harvests in recent years thanks to erratic weather from climate change , @entity69 acknowledges this could impact wine production levels			1
while consumers are not going to see a drastic price difference when purchasing wine from supermarkets , she says it all depends on the region of wine			0
" the @entity99 harvest and the @entity101 harvest this year have been abysmal ... if you wanted wine from the 2013 @entity99 or some parts of @entity27 , you 're going to have a big problem			0
you will probably pay a lot more for those wines , " she explains			0
" the question is can you substitute other types of wine for those ? now , the answer is yes			0
" she adds : " @entity9 , by the way , were not wrong in what they said			0
they did use very good figures and they do know what they are talking about but the world of wine is just so complex			0

industry **experts** release global production report countering @entity9 findings
