-- " free at last ! free at last ! thank @entity1 , i 'm free at last			2
" i was not yet 4 when the rev. @entity3 spoke those words			2
it has been 50 years			1
and yet ... i am not a little girl			2
i do n't live behind two sets of railroad tracks in the poor black section of town			2
but i 'm still a mediator			2
i 'm still an optimist			2
i still believe in sharing			0
i still love the garden			0
so i guess there 's still a little bit of that little girl in me			0
it seems almost superfluous to list the progress we 've made when it comes to integration and equality			0
and yet ... there are incidents -- events -- tone - deaf statements that serve as constant reminders of the inequalities and injustices we must still struggle with			1
these are often overlooked , or misread , or used as " red meat " to stir strong partisans with fear and loathing			0
5 faces of the march on @entity39 by " we " i do n't mean just blacks , or @entity43 , or women -- or any group you care to name			1
we are in this together			0
each of us has something to contribute			0
and each of our groups has something to contribute			0
but still ... @entity54 : out of the many , one			0
and so i come back to the @entity56 -- the date chosen to coincide with the hundred - year anniversary of the @entity59			1
the struggle for true emancipation -- economic equality , political freedom , societal access , education , the right to vote , etc. -- has been long and arduous			1
that we have come a long way , we must acknowledge			1
and the sacrifice of so many who believed @entity71 could live up to its promise , we must honor			0
as tens of thousands of @entity73 gather in @entity39 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the historic 1963 march on @entity39 , we must embrace the changes that we 've made together			1
in 1963 , @entity3 said the @entity76 and the @entity77 were " promissory notes " to every future @entity73 , but that " @entity71 has given the @entity80 people a bad check which has come back marked ' insufficient funds			1
' but we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt			0
... so we have come to cash this check -- a check that will give us upon demand the riches of freedom and the security of justice			0
" at march on @entity39 : the anger , fear , love and hope five years later he again spoke of the " promissory note , " this time quoting @entity97 : " we are going to bring the tired , the poor , the huddled masses			1
we are going to bring those who have known long years of hurt and neglect			1
" @entity3 's last campaign was the " @entity114 , " because , as he argued in one of his sermons , " if a man does n't have a job or an income , he has neither life nor liberty nor the possibility for the pursuit of happiness			0
" i think it 's important to remember that civil rights and economic rights are mutually dependent			2
i mean this in two ways			0
first , as @entity3 expressed it : " @entity71 , how often have you taken necessities from the masses to give luxuries to the classes			0
... @entity1 never intended for one group of people to live in superfluous inordinate wealth , while others live in abject deadening poverty			0
" i want to make sure we understand that not only are race and economics intertwined , but also that economics changes the political equation			2
for instance , the 1963 march on @entity39 called for " a massive federal public works program to provide jobs for all the unemployed " and spoke of the " twin evils of discrimination and economic deprivation			1
" the only class mlk ever taught we see this truth played out in the politics of today -- whether the discrimination is against blacks , hispanics , women , the poor , elderly , @entity149 or any other group			0
we find that political emancipation both requires and demands economic emancipation			1
and economic emancipation , in turn , depends more and more on educational emancipation			1
as @entity160 and @entity161 report in their book , " @entity157 ' views of racial inequality : the @entity168 , " the " gradual growth of the black middle class , the increase in the number of elected black officials at all levels of government , the growing presence of african - americans in prominent positions in business and the arts , and the rise in the political and economic prominence of members of other ethnic groups along with women of various races and ethnicities , all have presumably propelled and reinforced the growth of more favorable attitudes toward african - americans			1
" a @entity3 daughter 's long journey in other words , if we look back on the last 50 years , we have to not just admit , but agree that we have moved closer to the realization of the true @entity73 dream , as articulated by @entity3 : " @entity195 that my four children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character			1
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity206 .			1

*tuesday* is the 50th anniversary of the historic 1963 march on @entity39
@entity206 : the struggle for true emancipation has been long and arduous
she says political emancipation both requires and demands economic emancipation
@entity206 : in 50 years , we have moved closer to the realization of the true @entity73 dream
