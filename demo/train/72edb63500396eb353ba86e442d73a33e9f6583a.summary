@entity1 adolescents and summer camp go together like bug juice and s'mores			1
for many young adults , the occasion marks a golden opportunity for co-ed camaraderie in the mess hall or even a stolen kiss in the woods			2
as the last of the sleepaway campers begrudgingly say their goodbyes to bunkmates this month , it 's worth remembering that some campers and counselors keep the campfire flames burning much longer with summer flings that become lifetime commitments			2
a first -- and last -- kiss " i always went to camp kicking and screaming , " @entity23 said of her early teenage years at @entity25 in @entity26 , @entity27			1
that is , until a blond boy named @entity30 showed up to camp one summer			1
" and then i never wanted to leave , " she laughs			2
for two summers , @entity23 shared laughs and awkward slow dances with @entity30 , who " always had this smile on his face , and his eyes twinkled			2
" but -- if " @entity43 " taught anything about those summer nights -- as camp ended , so did their teenage romance			1
fast - forward to 2006 , when @entity23 signed up for the social networking site @entity47 and one blast - from - the - past name popped into her mind : @entity52			2
they both were in relationships at the time , but exchanged a few friendly messages			2
a year later , with both of them newly and conveniently single , @entity30 wrote @entity23 saying he would be in @entity58 for his brother 's wedding and asked if she would like to meet for a drink			1
drinks turned into dinner , which five days later turned into plans to move cross-country -- @entity30 packed up two months later			0
in 2008 , when the topic of marriage crept up , they knew the only venue that would suit : @entity25			0
@entity23 phoned the director , knowing it was n't a typical wedding venue			0
the only date the camp had free amid busy summer sessions was may 31 , 2009			1
" we 'll take it , " she said			0
they had a date and a venue , but no formal engagement , which came shortly after			0
" i look back and am like ' we were crazy ! ' but it never felt like that , " she says			1
the two married , surrounded by 150 friends and family , and shared a slightly less awkward slow dance right where it all started			1
@entity30 and @entity23 , now 34 and 33 , live in @entity91 with their two sons , who are already attending family weekend at the same camp where their parents met			1
@entity30 jokes @entity23 was his first -- and now last -- kiss			0
when a wrong room turns out right as an avid skier during her adolescence , @entity99 opted to attend a special off - season ski camp , @entity103 , in @entity104 , @entity105			1
instead of cabins , campers were put up in hotel rooms at a ski resort for their two - week summer sessions			0
as campers were getting settled in , @entity99 wanted to surprise a friend she had met on the competitive ski circuit and asked for her room number at the front desk			0
" i ran in the room and yelled ' @entity117 ! ' -- then quickly realized it was not @entity119 , " she says			0
instead , she found " a very cute boy with green eyes and a nice smile , " who introduced himself as @entity124			0
it was a scene right out of a teen romance novel			0
" the second that i met him , it was like a bolt of lightning , " she says			0
the pair hung out all through the summer , and continued to rekindle their relationship each summer , even when @entity124 became a counselor			0
" he would get his hand slapped for making out with me , because i was a camper ! " @entity99 says			0
ski camp turned out to be a good investment for a few reasons -- @entity124 went on to compete worldwide , in the @entity141 , and has since retired and been instrumental in creating judging criteria for slopestyle skiing , which made its @entity145 debut in @entity146 , @entity147 , in february			1
the couple will have been married four years this month and their relationship shows no signs of going downhill			1
a perfect rainy day activity @entity152 arrived at @entity153 in @entity154 from her native @entity155 in 2002 with nothing but a backpack full of clothes			0
when a fellow camp counselor named @entity160 picked her up at the airport , little did she know she had met her life mate			1
during the off - season , the two began dating			0
as their second summer working together approached , @entity160 organized a marriage proposal during a camp assembly with plenty of whitewater - related puns about never knowing what 's around the bend			1
@entity152 's answer : " yes ! " but , they decided , why wait ? so they made plans to get married that summer as well			1
when @entity152 and @entity160 showed up at town hall to make arrangements , the town clerk asked if she could do the ceremony with people who knew them , to ensure it was n't just a ploy to get a green card for @entity152			0
the couple thought of @entity188 's director , not to mention the 300 campers who had witnessed their proposal earlier that summer			0
meanwhile , the camp director was trying to come up with a " rainy day activity " when the perfect backup plan walked in the door -- @entity160 and @entity152			1
the whole camp pitched in on the big day of july 18 , 2003			1
one of the counselors let @entity152 borrow a white dress , the senior campers straightened her hair and did her makeup , a camper played @entity207 's " @entity205 in @entity206 " on the piano , the camp 's chef made a multi-tiered wedding cake , and the silversmithing department even made rings for the couple			1
the clerk showed up and performed the ceremony in the camp 's main hall			2
getting married at camp ensured the ceremony was simple , with little pomp , circumstance and fretting beforehand			1
" there was no fighting over the color of the place napkins , " @entity220 says			0
the couple has since purchased a camp nearby , @entity227 , where they live year - round with their son , @entity229 , 4½ , and daughter @entity231 , 6½			2
the @entity232 have experienced adversity as well , with @entity152 suffering a traumatic spinal cord injury during a family bike trip after camp season in 2011			2
support and encouragement from family members and @entity227 campers have helped @entity152 along her road to recovery			0
and to think it all started when an @entity1 camp counselor gave his @entity155 colleague a ride from the airport			2
" you never know where camp will lead you , " @entity160 says .			1

@entity103 romances are a *classic* pop *culture* trope , and they can be very real
couples who meet at camp sometimes choose to go back to get married or engaged there
" you never know where camp will lead you , " says one camp owner
