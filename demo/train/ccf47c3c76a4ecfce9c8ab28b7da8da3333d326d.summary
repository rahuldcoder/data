" on november 1 , 2012 , officials at the ( @entity21 ) reported that while conducting pharmacy inspection rounds on the inpatient units , they discovered that insulin pens intended for individual patient use were found in the supply drawer of the medication carts without a patient label on them , " said the memo , obtained by @entity0 through the office of @entity17 rep. @entity16 , @entity18 - @entity10			1
" although the disposable needles were changed each time it was used , the insulin pens intended for individual patient use may have been used on more than one patient			1
" " there is a very small chance that some patients could have been exposed to the hepatitis b virus , the hepatitis c virus , or @entity4 , based on practices identified at the facility , " the congressional memo states			1
" ( the health system ) determined that all veterans who were prescribed the insulin pen during an inpatient stay from october 19 , 2010 , to november 1 , 2012 , should be notified			1

" veterans and their families will have an opportunity to speak with a nurse who will answer questions they may have and assist with managing followup care , " @entity44 said			2
@entity12 under scrutiny after @entity60 ' cases however , slow patient outreach has also been a contentious issue			0
" beyond the fact that the error occurred at all , most concerning was the length of time it took the @entity71 to catch the error -- over two years , as well as the three - month delay in informing patients who may have been exposed , " @entity16 , whose district includes the city of @entity9 , wrote in a letter to the @entity12 on monday			2

the devices are never to be used by more than one person			0

@entity88 also called the situation in @entity9 " unacceptable			0
