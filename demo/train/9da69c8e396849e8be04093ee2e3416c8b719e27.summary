-- they 've already conquered @entity2			1
now , a dream team of viral video superstars is hoping to hit the big screen			1
on monday , the masterminds behind " the chronicles of @entity8 " released a four - minute trailer they hope will help them finish bankrolling a feature - length film			1
the video , an update of a shorter , more cryptic teaser trailer that has been circulating online for a few weeks , features @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 among others			1
executive producer @entity19 estimates the half - dozen internet meme makers in the trailer have accounted for more than 2 billion page views combined ( including , he said , copycat versions of their videos and views on sites other than @entity2 )			1
he said he 's hoping the film , for which he said he 's still pursuing additional financial backing , " will quite literally market itself			0
" others in the low - budget trailer include @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity34 and @entity35 , the brothers from the " @entity38 " video			1
no word on whether " @entity40 " or the dramatic chipmunk were unavailable			0
@entity42 , who also wrote the script and appears as title character " @entity48 " ( a role he said he 'd happily hand over to a more professional actor ) , said the trailer was shot in @entity50 in january			2
" everyone was pretty excited from the beginning and everyone really enjoyed working together , too , " he said			0
" that 's one of those dynamics -- you do n't know how it 's going to turn out , but it went really well			0
" all of the video stars were asked to stay quiet about the ultimate goal of the filming until now , @entity42 said			1
" we 're obviously all hoping to be working again in the near future , " he said			0
the trailer , which @entity42 previewed for @entity0 earlier monday , comes across as a tongue - in - cheek take on epic adventures such as " @entity69 " and " @entity70			1
" in it , the main character is transported into a woodsy realm called " @entity74 " to rescue a girl he met on a dating site			0
with the help of the viral stars , he battles evil creatures such as living , breathing pop - up ads. @entity42 said he hopes the new trailer will help convince financial backers to jump onboard			1
he said he also hopes it will help dispel the theory that the whole thing is just a big joke			2
some , including fans of the movie 's @entity91 page , have questioned whether it 's all a setup			2
after all , the movie 's name is a reference to a viral online trick			1
@entity42 acknowledged a grand con would be fun but said that 's not what 's going on			0
he 's put the name of his production company , @entity19 , behind it -- not to mention the money spent to record a theater - quality trailer , he said			2
" that would be a lot of money to waste on a @entity8 , " he said			2
" we have a reputation to keep			0
we 're not going to put something on @entity113 , do all of these press interviews and put a trailer out just for a joke			0
i 'd never be able to do anything again			0
" @entity19 , based in @entity119 , @entity50 , specializes in viral marketing , video production and editing and other media - related jobs			1
the movie effort is n't @entity42 's first time embarking on a high - profile , unconventional web - based venture			2
in 2005 , @entity42 grabbed international attention by auctioning off advertising space on his forehead on @entity131			0
the winners , a stop - snoring - fast company , paid him more than $ 37,000 for a temporary tattoo .			0
