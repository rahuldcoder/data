-- it may not be legal , but it 's definitely popular			0
for just 10 @entity4 quetzals , or 15 @entity5 pesos ( the equivalent of just over a @entity8 dollar ) , you can pay to ride a zip line across a river and into a new country			1
a news team from @entity5 's @entity14 network , a @entity0 affiliate , found four zip lines crossing over the @entity17 , which serves as part of @entity5 's southeastern border with @entity4			1
they observed people crossing into @entity5 in broad daylight , apparently not worried about immigration authorities posted not far from there			2
guatemalans on both sides of the border are in charge of the zip line and collecting money from people willing to cross			2
a @entity4 immigrant getting ready to cross the border using the zip line admitted he was doing so illegally			1
he said he had " obtained my passport but did n't know i also need a visa to cross " into @entity5			2
@entity5 shares a largely unpopulated , almost 600 - mile border with @entity4 marked by jungle and rugged mountains			1
the zip lines connect the @entity4 community of @entity42 to the @entity5 town of @entity44			1
once in @entity5 , migrants travel on freight trains or by bus to the @entity8 border , although many never get there			1
last week , @entity5 authorities stopped a bus in the central @entity5 state of @entity53 with 104 undocumented migrants on board			0
last august , 72 migrants were killed by a @entity5 drug cartel in a ranch in @entity59 , @entity60 , only 100 miles south of the @entity8 border			1
those who do get to the @entity8 border have another river to cross , the @entity62 ( or @entity62 , as it 's known in @entity5 ) or a 21 - foot wall			1
many are now going underground			0
on a recent trip to @entity67 , @entity8 border patrol agents gave a @entity0 crew access to a tunnel being illegally used for this purpose			2
the mile - long tunnel was built to prevent flooding in the border city of @entity74 , @entity67 , but it has been increasingly used in recent years to smuggle immigrants and drugs			0
@entity8 @entity78 agent @entity77 says crossing this way can be dangerous			0
" there was a group down here and then they got caught in the flash flood and hours later they were looking for a body north of the openings , " says @entity77			0
some immigrants die trekking across the treacherous @entity67 desert , but many thousands more make it to the land of their dreams , after a trip of hundreds -- even thousands -- of miles			0
for some , that journey begins at a zip line across the @entity17 .			0

zip lines cross the @entity17 on the @entity4 - @entity5 border
people entering @entity5 illegally can ride across for a relatively *modest* *sum*
a long and dangerous road still lies *ahead* for those *heading* for the @entity8
