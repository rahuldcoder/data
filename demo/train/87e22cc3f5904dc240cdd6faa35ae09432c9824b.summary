[ breaking news update , posted at 10.45 p.m. et ] @entity4 's @entity3 concedes defeat to opposition candidate @entity6 in the country 's presidential election , prime minister - designate @entity2 tells @entity0			1
[ previous story , posted at 8.17 p.m. et ] ( @entity0 ) -- in november , when @entity4 president @entity3 called an election two years earlier than necessary , the path ahead looked clear for an unprecedented third term in office			1
but as the nation of 15 million eligible voters waits for the results of yesterday 's polls , the 69 - year - old 's electoral ambitions may be in jeopardy			0
after enabling an extension of his presidency by doing away with a two - term limit , @entity3 's campaign was spectacularly wrong - footed by the surprise defection of dozens of political allies -- including the man who now threatens to unseat him			1
@entity6 , 63 , was general - secretary of @entity3 's @entity29 and health minister in his cabinet when he defected			1
he is now challenging him for the presidency , on behalf of a broad opposition alliance analysts describe as the most serious challenge @entity3 has faced			2
the race -- which watchdogs say has been marred by hundreds of incidents of political violence and government misuse of state media -- has been too close to call			0
opinion polls and analysts spoken to by @entity0 are divided on the outcome			0
" it 's not auguring very well for ( @entity3 )			1
he 's got a contest on his hands , " said @entity46 , executive director of @entity4 's @entity47			1
he said @entity3 , accustomed to a weak and fragmented opposition , could not have anticipated facing a united alliance of nearly 40 parties -- including 23 parliamentarians who have defected from the president 's own grouping , as well as nationalists from the @entity58 majority and @entity59 and @entity61 minorities in the ethnically diverse nation			1
" he did n't expect the candidate to be @entity6 , " said @entity46			2
" i think he probably underestimated the disaffection in the country and the desire for change			0
" ' @entity68 ' @entity3 , a lawyer by trade , entered parliament in 1970 , became prime minister in 2004 and was narrowly elected president a year later			2
in 2010 , he was returned to power with 58 % of the vote			0
his crowning achievement in office has been crushing the @entity77 and bringing an end to the bloody 25 - year civil war that had raged between the state and the @entity59 separatists			1
the conduct of both the government and the @entity77 was slammed by legal experts at the @entity85 , who accused both sides in a 2011 report of war crimes and crimes against humanity			0
yet the victory -- delivering security and renewed prosperity to the war - ravaged nation , with an average of 7 % economic growth a year during his presidency -- remains his prime political asset , says @entity101 , a political scientist and former @entity4 diplomat			1
" when voters turn on their tvs and they see the attack on @entity107 , on the @entity109 school , or @entity110 , it reminds them of how hideous it is to live under terrorism , " he said			0
" that 's something the @entity4 voters have done for years , and whatever they think of the rest of his style of governance , they think he 's the guy who made it go away			1
" he says the folksy @entity3 , whose mustached face is a ubiquitous sight on posters throughout the island nation and is frequently likened to an ancient @entity58 king , possesses " a rock star appeal			2
" but despite this , dissatisfaction appears to be growing with his rule , which is increasingly seen by some as autocratic , corrupt and nepotistic , he says			2
too much power ? following his 2010 reelection , an emboldened @entity3 amended the constitution to concentrate power in the presidential office and remove presidential term limits			1
to many @entity4 , says @entity46 , the move felt excessive			2
" they want the force of the executive president trimmed or abolished			0
" there is also a widespread perception , says @entity142 , that @entity3 " has been ladling out a disproportionate share of resources to his family , " and is focused on building a political dynasty			2
three of @entity3 's brothers occupy powerful positions : @entity152 is the minister of economic development , @entity151 is defense secretary and @entity154 is the speaker of parliament			1
minorities alienated the country 's significant minorities -- tamils , who comprise about 15 % of the population , and @entity61 , who account for 9 % -- have also largely thrown their lot in with the opposition , says @entity101			1
while @entity61 voters had previously supported @entity3 over his vocal support for @entity164 , he had " totally alienated " them in recent times with his perceived tolerance of monk - led @entity168 extremist group @entity167 ( @entity170 ) , which supports @entity3 's bid for re-election			1

the @entity167 has been blamed for instigating outbursts of @entity181 mob violence , including a deadly rampage in the town of @entity184 in june			0

" he 's a @entity194 from a peasant background -- you could n't get more mainstream than that in @entity4 politics , " he said			1
jailed early in his career in 1971 during a communist insurrection , @entity6 rejoined mainstream politics through the @entity29			0
while he lacks strong persona ; charisma , coming across as " a sober serious kind of man , " @entity6 presented a more appetizing alternative to voters than other potential opposition candidates , said @entity101			0
the opposition also benefited from having run a stronger campaign than the government , he said			0
so much so , @entity46 says , that " conventional wisdom suggests that ( @entity6 ) may have an edge " at the polls			0
for his part , @entity142 disagrees , comparing @entity3 's prospects to those of @entity220 president @entity219 during his most recent re-election			1
" the international media expected @entity219 to lose because opinion in @entity224 and @entity225 was against him , " he said			0
" but in the provinces where most of the votes come from , they voted the other way , because @entity219 was seen as having crushed the @entity231 terrorist threat and having restored the state of @entity220 in the world			0
" @entity142 's pick ? " @entity3 will probably lose all the cities			2
and the opposition , having won the campaign , will probably lose the election			0
" @entity0 's @entity239 contributed to this report .			0
