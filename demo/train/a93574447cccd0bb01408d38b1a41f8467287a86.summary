in one of the most highly - anticipated games in the series ' history , the @entity1 -- complete with their star trio of @entity12 and new signings @entity14 and @entity15 -- could not live up to close season expectations against the 17 - time @entity3 finals champions			1
but @entity15 -- who announced his decision to leave the @entity19 to join @entity1 in dramatic fashion on an hour - long television program on @entity22 in july -- believes his new team can improve sufficiently before the end of the season in april next year			1
