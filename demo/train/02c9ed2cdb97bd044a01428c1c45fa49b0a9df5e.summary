which country boasts the world 's fastest growing clean energy investment ? @entity3 ? no. @entity4 ? think again			0
jumping from a few hundred million dollars to $ 5.7 billion , @entity5 recorded last year the world 's highest growth in renewable energy investment , according to the @entity9 ( @entity9 )			1
the spectacular surge , led largely by investments in solar power projects , comes as @entity5 moves to reduce its dependency on coal , which accounts for around 86 % of its energy			1
to achieve that , the country has set the ambitious target of generating 18 gigawatts ( @entity20 ) of clean energy by 2030			0
as a result , a series of investments have trickled into the country , including @entity26 's first foray into @entity5 's solar power market			1
the internet giant , which has spent more than $ 1 billion in renewable energy projects in the @entity4 and @entity30 in recent years , announced in late may its decision to back the @entity32 , a 96 mw solar photovoltaic ( @entity35 ) plant in @entity36 , with a $ 12 million investment			1
read this : ' solar sisters ' spreading light in @entity5 " we only pursue investments that we believe make financial sense , " said @entity41 , @entity26 's director of energy and sustainability			1
" @entity5 's strong resources and supportive policies for renewable energy make it an attractive place to invest			1
" abundance of sun once completed , @entity52 is expected to be one of the biggest solar installations in the continent , capable of generating enough power for some 30,000 homes			0
it 's no secret that @entity5 has plentiful sunshine , with many parts of the continent enjoying daily solar radiation of between 4 kwh and @entity63 per square meter			1
but it 's no secret , either , that @entity5 has the world 's lowest electricity access rates , with more than half of its countries experiencing daily -- and costly -- power outages			2
amid such conditions , experts say investments in large - scale solar power projects could transform a continent faced with fast - rising populations and increasing demand for energy to support its economic growth			1
" six out of the 10 fastest economies in the world ( over the past decade ) were in @entity5 , and that requires much more energy , at a faster - growing pace than we 've seen before , " says @entity79 , deputy director - general of the @entity80			0
ambitious projects and some countries have already taken notice			0
while @entity5 is clearly setting the pace , projects are being announced across the continent as more countries look to unlock their massive solar potential			1
in late april , @entity95 launched what 's described as @entity5 's biggest solar pv plant so far , a 15 mw facility that is designed to account for 10 % of the country 's energy capacity , according to its developers			2
in early may , @entity102 began the first phase of the construction of a 160 mw concentrated solar power technology plant near @entity106 as part of the country 's efforts to produce 2,000 mw of solar energy by 2020			1
and late last year , @entity112 company @entity111 announced plans to build the @entity114 in @entity115 , a 155 mw facility			0
construction at the $ 400 million project is expected to begin in the first quarter of next year , while the plant should become fully operational by the end of 2015			0
obstacles yet , despite such ambitious schemes , experts say the continent is far from exploiting its massive solar energy potential			0
according to the @entity130 , coal , oil and gas together accounted for 81 % of @entity5 's total power generation in 2009 , with nuclear power making up 2 % , hydropower 16 % and all other renewable sources accounting for just 1 %			2
read this : harnessing pedal power to light up @entity5 @entity79 says that a lack of awareness about the current price competitiveness of solar technology , coupled with wider inefficiencies in the performance of most power utilities across the continent , is preventing @entity146 countries from scaling up their solar energy production			1
another problem is financing , as higher up - front capital costs , longer payback periods and a lack of solar - project experience in the banking sector make access to funds more challenging			1
" you need to involve banks and for many banks in @entity5 this is also new , so again you have to raise awareness , " says @entity79			2
" money typically comes with a risk premium which makes it more expensive than necessary			0
" actions others say , however , that it 's inadequate policies and a lack of political commitment that prevent solar from taking off			2
" the governments in @entity5 should change their attitude of thinking that solar is too expensive , " says @entity171 , chief executive of @entity173 - based @entity172			2
" every decision should be based on research that can help in allocating the energy budgets			0
" last year , a @entity9 report said that @entity5 's power sector needs to install an estimated 7,000 mw of new generation capacity each year			1
it warned that " unless stronger commitments and effective policy measures are taken to reverse current trends , " half the population of @entity184 will be without electricity in 2030			0
@entity189 , director of @entity191 - based @entity190 , says that in order for @entity5 to tap its clean energy potential , solar must take center stage in the continent 's energy discussions			2
" there needs to be a serious reassessment of how to do policy and finance to help solar meet its potential in @entity5 , " says @entity189			0
" this means not just addressing the needs of poor people -- it means using solar to address the energy sector needs for on and off grid and ... using it to help business , " he adds			0
" @entity213 needs to be at the table , with all of the other technologies			0

solar power projects are increasingly being announced across @entity5
experts say that @entity5 can use solar power to fuel its future growth
lack of awareness and financing are still major challenges
*industry* *insiders* also call for new policies to help the sector to take off
