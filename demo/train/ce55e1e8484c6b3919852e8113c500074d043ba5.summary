-- the @entity1 ordered @entity3 airlines thursday to replace a part that has come under suspicion in the crash of @entity6			1
@entity3 air safety authorities have ordered the replacement of a part on @entity11 planes following the crash of @entity6			1
the @entity1 gave airlines 120 days to replace devices that could be giving false airspeed indications			1
all 228 people on @entity6 were killed when the @entity11 plane crashed june 1 en route to @entity18 , @entity19 , from @entity20 , @entity21			0
the @entity3 air safety watchdog agency bypassed the usual process which allows for public comment on its orders			1
it said it could expedite the process because of the limited number of planes involved -- only 43 in the @entity3 -- and because they say it is prudent to make the change as quickly as possible			2
at the same time , it said it did not feel the risk warranted grounding the fleet of aircraft			0
@entity36 , one of only two @entity3 carriers who fly planes affected by the order , said thursday they had already replaced the part			1
" the work was completed last week			0
we are scheduled to take delivery of three new ... @entity49 by year 's end and those three will not require any ... changes , " a @entity36 spokesman told @entity47 via e-mail			2
@entity53 is the other @entity3 carrier that operates @entity54 , the @entity1 said			1
a spokeswoman for @entity57 airlines , @entity53 's parent company , said affected @entity53 planes are getting new parts			1
" we are well under way working closely with @entity11 and @entity64 to install the @entity64 pitot tubes within the required timelines , " @entity61 told @entity47			0
the devices under suspicion are the @entity69 pitot probes on some @entity11 and @entity71 aircraft			2
they measure " ram air pressure , " the pressure exerted on the plane as it flies through the air , and are part of a system used to determine air speed			0
the @entity1 order requires aircraft operators to replace certain @entity69 pitot probes with certain @entity64 or newer - design @entity69 pitot probes			2
the @entity1 says the order is intended to " prevent airspeed discrepancies , which could lead to disconnect of the autopilot and / or auto - thrust functions and consequent increased pilot workload			2
" @entity19 authorities are still investigating the cause of the @entity92 crash			1
but tests conducted since the crash have brought into question the performance of the pitot tubes and authorities say there have been reports of other malfunctions on flights			0
no @entity3 operator flies @entity103			0
there are 302 of the aircraft worldwide			0
the @entity1 action follows an announcement by @entity109 air safety authorities earlier this week to require pitot tube replacements by september 7 .			0
