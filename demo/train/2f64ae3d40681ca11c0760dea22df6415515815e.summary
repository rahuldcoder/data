@entity0 -- president @entity2 took to the @entity4 - language network airwaves monday to discuss challenges in educating @entity7 students			1
in a @entity10 - sponsored town hall meeting with @entity7 students and educators at @entity13 in @entity0 , the president said to out - educate and out - innovate the global competition , the @entity7 community must play a key role in the future			1
" our workforce is going to be more diverse ; it is going to be , to a large percentage , @entity7			2
and if our young people are not getting the kind of education they need , we wo n't succeed as a nation , " @entity2 said			2
with several students and parents asking questions about immigration and deportations , @entity2 said the answer would n't be overnight			2
he hoped the @entity29 , which would give kids who have grown up in the @entity31 an opportunity to earn citizenship despite their family 's immigration status , would be passed in the future			2
" we did n't get it passed this time , but i do n't want young people to be giving up because if people in the past had given up , we probably would n't have women 's rights , we would n't have civil rights			2
so many changes that we 've made had to do with young people being willing to struggle and fight to make sure that their voices are heard , " said @entity2			0
@entity45 , an @entity46 teacher at @entity47 in @entity48 , says one challenge she faces with her @entity7 students is that they have n't been in the @entity31 long enough to become proficient in @entity46			1
although they only read at the " first - grade , or second - grade level , " @entity51 and other teachers are supposed to teach them the material they will need to pass state - mandated tests in order to graduate from high school and possibly attend college			1
it does n't help that many of the students do n't speak @entity46 at home			1
" they do n't have the skills because they do n't practice except in the classroom , " she said			0
@entity2 said that strong programs , including both bilingual education and immersion programs , are key to making sure bilingual students keep up with their studies while becoming fluent in @entity46			1
he said that it 's up to both schools and parents			0
" we have schools that do it very well ; there are some schools that do n't do it as well			0
we want to lift up those models that do it well , " the president said			0
" and parents should be demanding and insisting that even if your child is not a native @entity46 speaker , there is no reason why they ca n't succeed in school , and schools have an obligation to make sure that those children are provided for			1
they have rights just like everybody else			0
" latino students make up over 20 % of the pre-kindergarten - through - high - school students in the @entity31 , secretary of the education @entity98 said in a conference call with reporters last week			1
" these students face real and growing challenges that we have to address			0
" @entity98 said that only about half of all @entity7 students earn their high school diploma on time , and only one in eight end up with a bachelor 's degree			1
the problems faced by @entity112 in high school are unique , said @entity114 of the @entity115			1
" we have a small percentage of the population that has a college degree , " said @entity114			0
" even if you throw in community college degrees , we only get up to 19 %			0
" @entity114 said these students are often the first in their family to go to college , suggesting school officials need to target parents to make sure they understand what courses their children need to take to get into college and how student loans work			0
