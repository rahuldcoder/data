-- on april 9 , 2010 , the sun - powered @entity3 - @entity2 aircraft took off from a runway in @entity6 , @entity7 , on its maiden flight			1
over the next 87 minutes it climbed to 1,200 meters , and undertook a series of tests and maneuvers to assess its reliability and performance , before returning test pilot @entity15 safely to earth			0
but does this remarkable new aircraft really represent the future of clean , green aviation ? the team behind the flight aim to build a solar - powered plane capable of flying at night on stored energy that can circumnavigate the globe			1
to find out more , @entity0 spoke to solar impulse chairman and initiator , @entity27			1
@entity0 : how did you feel after the first test flight ? @entity27 : the whole flight was an extremely intense moment , specifically the take - off			1
and when the plane touched the ground i felt an amazing sense of relief			0
we had the confirmation that the team who worked on this solar airplane for the last 7 years did an astounding job			1
this prototype is an amazingly complicated piece of engineering , with the wingspan of a jumbo jet , the weight of a car and the average power of a small motorcycle			0
@entity0 : how successful was it ? @entity27 : the first indications from the engineers are that everything went perfectly well -- the climb performances were even higher than expected ! what is the next stage ? the objective of this first prototype is to demonstrate by this summer , the feasibility of a night flight propelled only by solar energy			1
before that , we 'll do several additional test flights , each lasting a bit longer , until we complete the first complete day - night - day flight cycle			2
then with the experience of this first aircraft we will start the design of a second airplane whose objectives will be to cross the @entity76 and then by 2013 , to fly around the world in five legs , each lasting five days			2
@entity0 : what is your ultimate vision for the project ? @entity27 : with @entity3 we want to demonstrate what can be achieved today with renewable energy and technologies that allow energy savings			1
if an aircraft is able to fly day and night without fuel , propelled only by solar energy , no one will be allowed to claim anymore that it is impossible to use the same technologies for motor vehicles , heating and cooling systems or computers , etc. this project voices our conviction that a pioneering spirit with political vision can together change society and reduce society 's dependence on fossil energies			1
@entity0 : do you see it having commercial applications ? if so , what and when might we see them in use ? @entity27 : we could see our technologies used for high altitude remote - controlled solar - powered telecommunication platforms			1
but for airliners , remember when @entity117 made his @entity76 flight in 1927 ; he was alone in an airplane whose payload was used for gasoline and nobody could imagine that hundreds of passengers would cross the ocean a few years later			2
today , @entity3 holds one pilot and 400kgs of batteries			2
@entity0 : what will happen in the future ? @entity27 : i do n't know , but aviation will have to evolve to meet the challenges of environment and increasing fuel prices			2
@entity0 : how will solar - powered planes fly at night or in very bad weather ? @entity27 : the 200 square meters of solar cells on the wing of the aircraft will allow the propellers to run during the day and reach an altitude of 27,000 feet			1
at the same time , the excess of energy will charge the 400 kg of batteries			0
at sunset , the airplane will slowly glide down to 10 000 ft and the energy stored in the batteries during the day , will be released to allow the aircraft to fly during the night			0
the batteries have to carry the airplane until the next sunrise ! of course we need sun light during the day , and we have to avoid flying in bad weather , particularly because our gigantic wingspan and very light wing loading do n't accept big turbulences			0
@entity0 : how have big aerospace corporations responded to your project ? @entity27 : the first one who immediately believed in my vision was @entity163 from @entity164			2
then the support came from the @entity166 ( @entity166 ) , @entity167 , @entity168 and @entity169 to launch the project			0
the feasibility study lead by @entity172 illustrated that it would be extremely difficult , albeit feasible			0
the aircraft would need a gigantic wingspan and have to be exceptionally light			0
for the construction , we went to aircraft manufacturers with our requirements and they said it was impossible : hence we approached a boat manufacturer -- and as he did n't know it was impossible , he helped us			0
we had to assemble our own team and during 7 years we went through calculations , simulations , projections , design , construction and thousand of tests			1
of course , the journey until the around the world tour is still long and filled with many challenges			0
however , today we have accomplished a successful maiden flight with the first prototype			1
@entity0 : the global aerospace industry is obviously vast and has much entrenched knowledge and technology ; do you think corporations will be open - minded and open to change ? @entity27 : undoubtedly , they will have to ! the price of fuel will progressively become unaffordable : it 's just a question of time			2
the industries will have to reduce their consumption by using energy savings technologies and switch to renewables			0
there are corporations that understood this and already now invest in clean tech. those who do n't will go bankrupt , because they will have missed out on this new trend ! the question is , " on which side do you want to be ? "			0

maiden flight of @entity3 plane is first step towards solar night flying
initiator of project is aeronaut , @entity27 ; project has been going 7 years
aim is to build solar - powered plane to fly *non-stop* round the world
