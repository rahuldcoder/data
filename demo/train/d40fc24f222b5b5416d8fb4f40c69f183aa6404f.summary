-- a bad breakup : nothing can be as emotionally tumultuous for a young heart			0
except maybe finding out via your @entity4 newsfeed that your college ex is dating someone from your fraternity			1
that was the defining moment that eventually led @entity10 , 24 , to ultimately break up with something else : @entity4			1
" i did n't want to see what was going on with them , " said @entity10			0
" so i deactivated my account			0
" with a website that boasts 901 million active users and is launching an ipo on friday , it seems unlikely that once you get on @entity4 , you 'd ever leave			1
but deactivating from the social networking site is not that unusual			1
close to half of @entity22 think @entity4 is a passing fad , according to the results of a new @entity27 - @entity26 poll			1
more and more people are stepping away from the technological realm and de-teching			0
there are even sites where they can pledge to delete their @entity4 accounts			1
and tech writer @entity35 from @entity36 decided to leave the internet for a year to reassess his relationship with it			0
we asked whether any of you had left @entity4 , and the responses urged in			1
from privacy issues to a need for more face time , the reasons for choosing to live without @entity4 ran deep			1
maintaining a professional image although @entity10 , now a consultant , initially left @entity4 for social reasons , he says he was also thinking about his career			1
" you do n't want a future employer to find something that they would deem questionable , " he said			0
job prospects and personal privacy compelled high school student @entity58 , 18 , to deactivate his @entity4 account as well			1
ever since he can remember , @entity58 has wanted to join the @entity59			0
now , as he comes closer to making that dream a reality , he says he wants to maintain a professional image			0
" there are things on @entity4 that i do n't want my employer to see , and what i was told was ' what 's on @entity4 stays on @entity4			1
' " despite leaving the site for privacy reasons , @entity58 considers @entity4 to be a pioneering company			1
" i would totally buy their ipos if i had the money , but i 'm just not [ as ] into @entity4 as i used to be , and i think it is from the life decisions i have made , " he said			2
focusing on " real " communication putting in the effort to make a phone call : that 's what @entity78 does now after deleting her @entity4 account			1
@entity78 's move off @entity4 was gradual and started when she found the site went from being fun to being habitual			1
" i was literally on it all the time , " she said			0
" when i first logged off for good , i would think about getting back on			0
but the more i stayed away from it , the more i realized i did n't need it			0
" @entity78 says after deactivating from the site , she makes a greater effort to socially engage with others			0
" it 's funny , it 's called a social networking site , but we are sort of disconnecting , " she said			2
" it is mass communicating , but we are losing something -- we are losing our interpersonal skills			0
" @entity99 says he started feeling the content on @entity4 became impersonal and irrelevant to his life			2
so he and his wife deactivated their accounts after five years on the site			0
he says their social lives improved after leaving @entity4 because now they focus on more in - person connections			1
" we feel like we have strengthened relationships with close friends and family that are truly important to us , and not concerned ourselves with the other hundreds of ' friends ' that really are n't important , " he said			0
shedding an emotional burden a study from @entity115 says there is a direct correlation between the amount of time spent on @entity4 and the way people perceive their lives			1
users that spent more time on the site reportedly thought their @entity4 friends had better lives than themselves			1
that definitely rings a bell for @entity130 ( who did n't want her last name used )			0
she says @entity4 made her perceive herself differently , and she felt pressured to be a certain way			2
the 28 - year - old deleted her account 10 months ago when she realized how self - conscious @entity4 made her feel			2
she started caring too much about what people she barely even knew thought about her profile and status updates , she explained			0
" to make myself feel important , i made up exaggerated posts to garner attention from friends , " she remembers			0
" does that make sense ... no , but maybe i was not aware that i was unconsciously doing that until i got off [ the site ]			0
" avoiding a time - waster the average @entity4 user spends more than six hours a week on the site			1
for some , that 's just too much time			2
as a young mother , @entity152 , 30 , said @entity4 transformed into a time - waster for her			1
" i would sit on the computer , logged onto @entity4 , looking at photos of my high school friends ' baby pictures and i would think to myself , ' wow i have n't talked to these people -- there are people i have n't spoken to in 10 years , " she said			2
after deactivating her account , @entity152 found time to sit down with classic novels and spend more them with her young children			1
" it is so easy to lose an hour of time on @entity4 , " she said			1
@entity152 's friends and even her husband are still on the site			0
after deactivating from @entity4 , she now notices that people are not as engaged with their real lives because they are so entranced with their cyberlives			1
" my husband would get these updates of his friends at a bar , and they would be updating their @entity4 with photos and he said , ' i wonder what it must be like to hang out with someone that is constantly updating , ' " she said			2
maintaining personal privacy privacy was the biggest reason behind @entity183 's deactivation from @entity4 in 2011			1
the 23 - year - old says that although the site is free to use , people are paying a price by providing their personal information			0
he says @entity4 is swiftly making profiles more public , and he does not want to compromise his privacy			2
" i do not want to be a part of this apparent mission to alter the norms of society , " @entity183 said			0
" @entity4 has frequently changed its privacy settings in the past and will do so again , always in favor of less privacy			1
" despite his adamant stance on maintaining his deactivation from @entity4 , @entity183 admits to missing the occasional social outing or party by not being a member of the site			1
" there is somewhat of a social price to be paid for rebelling against the trend , " he says , but he believes the people who really care about him will make the extra effort to stay in touch			2
a downside to de-teching ? although de-teching is emerging as a trend , some people noticed a negative stigma attached to not having a @entity4 account			2
@entity78 says people usually ca n't believe it when she tells them she is not on the site			0
" they are shocked that i no longer communicate using @entity4 , almost like there is something seriously wrong with me , " she said			2
@entity183 highlights similar experiences when people discover he is not on the social networking site			0
" once in a while a person will respond as if you 've attacked their religion and indignantly start defending the site and trying to convince me how great it is and why i should use it , " he said			0
@entity10 says he gets the " i ca n't believe you 're not on @entity4 " remark often			2
but he prefers face - to - face conversations much more than the digital , fleeting responses he would get via @entity4			2
even though he has noticed his social life change after @entity4 , he says overall he is happy with his decision to deactivate			1
" my network is smaller but stronger , " he says			0
@entity0 's @entity240 contributed to this report .			0

it 's the *unlikeliest* of tech trends : deactivating from @entity4 and social media sites
some are leaving @entity4 in favor of more " real " communication , free time
one study found that @entity4 could make users more *dissatisfied* with their lives
@entity4 *defectors* say they miss out on some events but are , overall , happier
