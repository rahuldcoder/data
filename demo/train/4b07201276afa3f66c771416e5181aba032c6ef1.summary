-- the film " @entity2 " compellingly describes many of the reasons why keeping orcas in captivity is -- and always has been -- a bad idea			1
the main premise of the film is that these large , intelligent , social predators are dangerous to their trainers			0
but orcas are also directly harmed by being confined in concrete tanks and the science is growing to support this common sense conclusion			2
the latest data show that orcas are more than three times as likely to die at any age in captivity as they are in the wild			1
this translates into a shorter life span and is probably the result of several factors			0
first , orcas in captivity are out of shape ; they are the equivalent of couch potatoes , as the largest orca tank in the world is less than one ten - thousandth of one percent ( 0.0001 % ) the size of the smallest home range of wild orcas			1
second , they are in artificial and often incompatible social groups			0
this contributes to chronic stress , which can depress the immune system and leave captive orcas susceptible to infections they would normally fight off in the wild			2
third , they often break their teeth chewing compulsively on metal gates			0
these broken teeth , even drilled and cleaned regularly by irrigation , are clear routes for bacteria to enter the bloodstream			0
these are the obvious factors ; there are almost certainly others contributing to the elevated mortality seen in captivity			2
these factors boil down simply to this : @entity61 kills orcas			1
yes , they may survive for years entertaining audiences , but eventually the stressors of captivity catch up to them			2
very few captive orcas make it to midlife ( approximately 30 years for males and 45 for females ) and not one out of more than 200 held in captivity has ever come close to old age ( 60 for males , 80 for females )			1
most captive orcas die while they are still very young by wild orca standards			2
there is a win / win solution to both the trainer safety and orca welfare dilemmas facing marine theme parks around the world , including @entity86 in the @entity87			1
these facilities can work with experts around the world to create sanctuaries where captive orcas can be rehabilitated and retired			1
these sanctuaries would be sea pens or netted - off bays or coves , in temperate to cold water natural habitat			0
they would offer the animals respite from performing and the constant exposure to a parade of strangers ( an entirely unnatural situation for a species whose social groupings are based on family ties and stability -- " strangers " essentially do not exist in orca society )			0
incompatible animals would not be forced to cohabit the same enclosures and family groups would be preserved			0
show business trainers would no longer be necessary			2
expert caretakers would continue to train retired whales for veterinary procedures , but would not get in the water and would remain at a safe distance ( this is known in zoo parlance as " protected contact " )			0
and the degree to which they interact directly with the whales would be each whale 's choice			0
a fundamental premise of these sanctuaries , however , is that eventually they would empty			0
breeding would not be allowed and captive orcas would no longer exist within the next few decades			2
many wildlife sanctuaries , for circus , roadside zoo and backyard refugees , exist around the globe for animals such as big cats , elephants and chimpanzees			0
the business ( usually nonprofit ) model for these types of facilities is therefore well - established for terrestrial species and can be adapted for orcas			1
wildlife sanctuaries are sometimes open to the public , although public interaction with the animals is usually minimized			0
a visitor 's center can offer education , real - time remote viewing of the animals , a gift shop , and in the case of whales and dolphins can even be a base for responsible whale watching if the sanctuary is in a suitable location for that activity			2
@entity168 theme parks do not need to lose out financially by phasing out orca shows ; this is a transformative proposal , not a punitive one			1
creating a whale or dolphin sanctuary is not entirely theoretical			1
@entity173 is pursuing the establishment of the world 's first bottlenose dolphin sanctuary with @entity177 and @entity178 ) , a nonprofit environmental group			1
whale and @entity178 put together a team to determine the feasibility of such a concept and the company has now identified potential sites and is studying the infrastructure that will be needed to support a group of retired dolphins			0
before the tragic death of @entity86 trainer @entity193 in 2010 , the ethical arguments against keeping orcas in captivity came largely from the animal welfare / animal rights community , with the marine theme parks basically ignoring or dismissing their opponents as a vocal and out - of - touch minority			1
now even staunch @entity86 supporters are wondering if the time has come to think outside the ( concrete ) box			1
furthermore , the marine mammal science community , which has long maintained a neutral stance on the question of whether orcas are a suitable species for captive display , has finally recognized the need to engage			1
an informal panel discussion on captive orcas is scheduled at the 20th @entity210 on the @entity211 in december , the first time this topic will be openly addressed by the world 's largest marine mammal science society			1
the first orca was put on public display in 1964			0
the debate on whether that was a good idea -- for people or the whales -- began the next day but did n't really heat up until the 1970s			0
it raged mostly on the fringe for the next 25 years			0
it picked up steam in the mid- 1990s , with the release of the film " @entity229 " and the rehabilitation of its orca star @entity228			0
and now , thanks in part to " @entity2 , " it is mainstream and consensus is building that orcas do n't belong in captivity			1
the marine theme parks can shift with the paradigm or be left behind -- it is up to them			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity242 .			2

@entity242 is working with an entertainment *conglomerate* to create a dolphin sanctuary
she says this business model could work for other marine theme parks , like @entity86
@entity242 , a marine mammal scientist , says " captivity kills orcas "
