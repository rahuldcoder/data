-- the power of the @entity3 military was on full display tuesday in @entity5 , where police reported the third consecutive day without a drug slaying			1
a federal police officer guards a checkpoint earlier this month in @entity5 , @entity3 ten drug - related killings in a single day were common before 9,500 army troops poured into the blood - soaked border town in the past few weeks , said @entity13 , a spokesman for the @entity5 municipal police			1
" it 's a much more secure city at this moment , " he said			2
" we have n't had murders with the same regularity and frequency as before			2
" but as president @entity22 's administration announced plans tuesday to beef up @entity25 security along its border with @entity3 , there are questions about whether increased military and police efforts in both nations can yield long - term results			1
@entity3 has been spiraling into a deepening pit of violence , with 6,500 people killed in 2008 and the body count continuing apace this year			1
most of that violence is occurring along the border , which worries @entity40			0
@entity3 president @entity41 and others have said recently that the @entity25 must share responsibility because the demand for drugs and most of the weapons used by drug cartels comes from north of the border			1
the drug war and security will be a major topic when @entity25 secretary of state @entity52 visits @entity3 on wednesday and thursday			1
@entity53 , director of the @entity55 's @entity54 , called @entity22 's pledge on tuesday to give $ 700 million in aid to @entity3 and assign an additional 360 staff along the border a " substantive commitment " that shows the @entity25 is serious about attacking the problem			1
" it 's an attempt to really put some substance behind the idea of shared responsibility , " @entity53 said			0
" they finally committed some of the resources they said they would to this			0
" success will depend on the follow - through , he said			0
" now is the hard part , " he said			2
" it 's not easy to follow the money trail or stop the weapons or the criminal networks			0
" others say the @entity22 plan falls short			0
@entity80 , director of the @entity81 , a @entity40 policy institute , calls it a " militarized strategy " that is n't oriented toward finding solutions based on economic development or social justice programs			2
" this is a feel - good strategy that is meant to produce the illusion of concrete developments taking place when it 's actually just really more of the same , " @entity80 said			0
" you 're talking about a 2,000 - mile border , so the odd 16 [ agents ] here or 12 there is not going to do the trick			0
" on the other hand , @entity3 's major military commitment is certainly showing short - term benefits			1
before the army arrived in @entity5 , there had been more than 400 drug killings this year , police spokesman @entity13 said			1
since the army arrived , slayings have dropped 95 percent , he said			0
@entity107 , president of the @entity40 - based @entity109 policy institute , says @entity3 's use of the army in @entity5 -- and its evident success -- " shows that @entity3 is definitely not a failed state			1
nobody is going to challenge the government for control of a certain area			0
" @entity53 sees it as " increased determination from the @entity3 government to establish order			1
" but there are limitations to using the military in @entity3 , @entity125 and @entity126 said			1
" there 's bad blood that exists between local communities and the military , " said @entity80			2
" the @entity3 military has not fought a war for years			1
it 's enemy has always been the local population			0
" @entity107 noted the cost in money , and to the daily fabric of life			2
" that 's not a cheap way of keeping law and order , " he said			0
" it does a great deal of harm to civilian institutions			0
the military is not trained to respect human liberties and individual rights			2
" it 's an ambivalence that many @entity3 feel : security versus liberties			1
polls consistently show that security is the top concern among a vast majority of @entity3			1
and for many @entity3 citizens , the drug war can still hit close to home no matter how far away they live from the front lines			1
@entity162 , a 30 - year - old bank loan officer with a wife and two young sons , lives in @entity165 in southern @entity3 , far from the violence tearing up @entity5 and other border cities			1
" @entity165 has always been relatively safe , " @entity168 said by telephone tuesday			0
he said a childhood friend worked for 2Â½ years in a high - paying white - collar job in @entity172 , across the border from @entity174 , @entity175			0
when he got married recently , his wife had one request : let 's move back to @entity165			0
they did , six months ago			0
" for them , it ( was ) very insecure , " @entity168 said			0
@entity172 was the site of a four - hour gun battle last month that left five drug traffickers dead and seven police wounded			2
people worldwide saw video of a television reporter sprawled on a bridge during that fight , trying to file an on - air report over the roar of gunfire			0
@entity107 says @entity3 president @entity41 's efforts to paint the @entity25 as partially responsible for the violence is lost on some @entity3			1
" in the end , " @entity107 said , " this is @entity3 's problem as much as @entity3 talks about a shared problem			2
the costs of not getting control of it will be paid by the @entity3			2

police in @entity5 , @entity3 , reported third straight day without a drug slaying
questions *remain* about whether increased security efforts can work long term
polls consistently show security is top concern among vast majority of @entity3
*distrust* of military has long been part of social fabric of @entity3 life
