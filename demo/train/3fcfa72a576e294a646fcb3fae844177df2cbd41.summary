-- " these types of patients have such disfigurement beforehand they ca n't eat , they ca n't breathe properly			2
it 's about functionality , " says dr. @entity5 , ceo of the @entity6			0
@entity5 is referring to the small group of people worldwide who are on waiting lists in hope of a new face , and in the @entity14 at least , they may now have one donated to them more readily			1
last month the @entity16 of @entity17 ( @entity18 ) , a non-profit organization managing the @entity14 organ transplant system , approved the first national policies for the transplantation of limbs , faces and other structures collectively known as " vascularized composite allografts " ( @entity26 ) -- which should make it easier to find donors			1
as of april 2014 , there had been 28 face transplants across the world			1
animal attacks , severe burns and gunshot wounds had left these recipients scarred for life , literally , in the one place their scars can not be hidden -- their face			1
" anyone with this disfigurement would argue they 're not living , they 're surviving , " says @entity5			0
face transplant recipients : new findings a growing field the first face transplant was performed in @entity48 in 2005 on @entity49 , whose mouth , nose and chin had been chewed away by her dog			1
since then the field has grown and transplants involving varying combinations of facial parts have been performed in six other countries , including the @entity14			1
as the procedures improve and their safety grows , donor registries and collaborating hospitals will increasingly be asking the question : would you like to donate your face ? or in the case of the @entity18 approval , asking family members of potential donors the sensitive question of whether they will donate the face of their loved one			1
the @entity18 approval will initially be in place temporarily for 15 months to enable public comment , but families of donors will receive extra guidance when it comes to making the decision			1
" face transplants remain unique and require very specific criteria such as hairlines and ethnic components , " explains a @entity18 spokesperson			1
" therefore consent should be distinct and individual			0
" " ( this ) will broaden the donor pool for wait - listed patients across a number of regional and national organ procurement organizations , " explains dr. @entity86 , professor of reconstructive plastic surgery at @entity88			0
" a major component for a successful procedure is patient selection on both the recipient and donor , " he adds			0
" the likeliness of a perfect match can be very challenging			0
" but this once - experimental procedure is becoming more widespread and accepted			0
@entity103 , from @entity102 , received a new face in march 2012 and last month his face was featured on the cover of the @entity14 edition of men 's magazine @entity108			1
@entity103 lost most of his facial features after a gun blast , and lost abilities such as his sense of smell			0
but after surgery at the hands of @entity86 and his team he can live his life once again			0
face transplant patients : where are they now ? risk of rejection however , as this mode of surgery becomes a norm , the side effects and risks that come with the life - changing operation are still a concern and a question of ethics			1
like any other transplant , there is a risk of the new organ being rejected by the patient 's immune system and recipients have to take immunosuppressive drugs for the rest of their lives , putting them at risk of infections and cancer			1
but unlike many other transplants , replacing a face is not a matter of life and death			2
the surgery is classed by some as life - changing , not life - saving , which raises questions as to whether this risk is justified			2
" for heart transplant patients they need a transplant or they will die			2
these ( face transplant ) patients are not in organ failure but are having to take anti-rejection medication and have lifelong repression , " explains dr. @entity161 , from the @entity162 , who performed a near - total face transplant in 2008 on @entity14 @entity164 , who was shot in the face by her husband			1
but @entity161 is working to solve this problem			0
" we need new therapies which will be less harmful , " she says			0
the @entity176 surgeon is developing chimeric cells , which bring together the cells from a donor and the recipient during transplantation			2
" we are fusing together cells from the bone marrow of donors and recipients so these cells will be recognized by the recipient 's immune systems as their own , " she explains			2
by combining the two cells and delivering them into patients receiving a transplant , their immune system will learn to recognize the donor 's cells , which are present throughout their new face , making their immune cells less likely to attack the face			1
" if the ( immune system ) can recognize more cells as ' self ' the patient will need less anti-rejection drugs , " says @entity161 , whose experimental therapy is hoped to enter clinical trials in a few years and when it does , may make face transplants more acceptable to critics			1
" @entity212 is the main ethical concern and new therapies are crucial for the future of this field , " she says			0
@entity5 feels the benefits of a new face counter ethical doubts			2
" there is no ethical issue , " he concludes			0
" i saw a patient walking down a crowded hospital hall a few years after surgery and no - one noticed them			0
he looked like a normal guy			0
to me , that 's the point of these surgeries			0

the first face transplant was performed in @entity48 in 2005
@entity14 has approved policies that will make it easier to find donors
*scientists* are developing *techniques* that will reduce risk of transplant rejection
