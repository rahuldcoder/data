the captain of the @entity2 ship @entity3 returned home to @entity5 on saturday after an absence of more than three months that included time in one of @entity10 's oldest prisons			1
" i 'm going to shovel out a path to the woodpile and get a fire going , " @entity11 said in a phone interview shorty after arriving at his house on @entity14			2
" that 's the first thing on my list			2
" @entity11 , 60 , who joined the environmental activist group in 1981 , was among 28 protesters and two journalists aboard the @entity2 vessel who were arrested by @entity26 authorities and thrown in jail in september			1
the 70 - foot @entity2 vessel was on a mission to protest a rig owned by @entity26 company @entity31 when a helicopter swooped down and paratroopers stormed the ship and arrested everyone on board			1
they were held in a prison in @entity39 for six weeks and then the remainder of the time in @entity41 , including a stint at @entity38 , which dates back to the late 1800s			2
the charges : piracy , with a potential sentence of 10 to 15 years in prison			1
while the charges were later reduced to " hooliganism , " they were still looking at a penalty of up to seven years in jail			1
" if it was n't the conditions that were so bad for the first six weeks in jail , it was the uncertainty of being charged with piracy , " @entity11 said			2
" that was the thing that caused the anxiety , the stress and the nervousness			2
" initally , the jailed activists , who became known as the @entity3 30 , spent 23 of 24 hours every day in small , cold cells			1
they were allowed one hour a day of solitary exercise in a " concrete box " slightly larger than their cells			2
" you could go for a months without seeing the sunshine and we did , " said @entity11 , who was the captain of the @entity2 rainbow warrior when it was bombed by @entity68 agents in @entity69 , @entity70 in 1985 , killing one crew member			1
at @entity38 , @entity11 said he shared a cell with a 40 - something @entity26 charged with dealing drugs			1
he was isolated from his crew			0
the two men played chess			0
his cellmate also would cook and share meals with him			0
" he cooked me some wonderful dinners , " @entity11 said			0
" he had a real grocery store in our cell			0
his family would bring him food			0
@entity2 would bring me food			1
he has an immersion heater which he put in a coffee bowl of water with vegetables and make a good soup			0
" @entity11 also spent time reading @entity97 books delivered by @entity2			1
the ordeal ended last week , with a sweeping amnesty program by @entity26 president @entity100			1
the amnesty law freed business executive @entity102 and two members of @entity26 punk band @entity104 , who were jailed for a performance critical of @entity100			1
" the reason we 're out ... is that there was such an outpouring of support for us all over over the world , from people like @entity115 and @entity116 laureates and senators , " @entity11 said			0
" we 'd still be in jail if we had n't had that kind of support			0
" another big reason : in less than two months the world attention will be on @entity26 's @entity122			1
" i 'm quite convinced the government did n't want is in jail during the @entity125 , " @entity11 said			0
" that would have been a huge mistake			0
there would have demonstrations at the @entity125 which they did n't want			0
it just was n't worth the trouble to keep us			0
" @entity11 said he remains committed to @entity2 and its environmental cause			2
he said he does so mostly for his two daughters , ages 18 and 22			0
in february he will embark on another @entity3 mission in the @entity136			0
" if somebody says that people in @entity26 and people around the world are much more aware of the dangers of drilling for oil anywhere , and especially in the @entity3 , i 'd say , ' ok , i can do two months for that , ' " @entity11 said			2
" what i could n't do for that is 10 to 15 years ... to me the alternative of turning the world over to the oil companies is not a viable option			1
