@entity0 -- the @entity2 approved the bipartisan " @entity10 " immigration reform bill on tuesday , sending the measure to the @entity2 floor for consideration and giving the bill 's backers their first major legislative victory			1
members of the @entity13 - controlled panel voted 13 - 5 in favor of the measure			1
if enacted , the plan would constitute the first overhaul of the nation 's immigration policy since 1986			2
" the dysfunction in our current immigration system affects all of us and it is long past time for reform			2
i hope that our history , our values , and our decency can inspire us finally to take action , " @entity2 chairman @entity24 , @entity25 , said			2
spectators cramming the committee room applauded and cheered loudly following the vote			0
the panel 's 10 @entity13 were joined in supporting the bill by three republicans : @entity37 's @entity36 , @entity39 's @entity38 , and @entity41 's @entity40			2
@entity36 and @entity38 are two of its four @entity43 authors			0
opinion : ' @entity46 unions follow @entity48 's lead on deportation both party leaders in the @entity2 appeared supportive of the effort , a positive sign for backers hoping to win a solid majority in the full chamber			1
" i think the ' @entity10 ' has made a substantial contribution to moving the issue forward , " said @entity2 minority leader @entity56 , @entity57			1
" i 'm hopeful we 'll be able to get a bill that we can pass here in the @entity2			1
" senate majority leader @entity63 , @entity64 , praised the " masterful " job of @entity24 in navigating roughly 300 proposed amendments and advancing the 844 - page bill to the floor			1
immigration reform is a priority for both parties in @entity0 and so far is one example of bipartisanship this year on major legislation in a sharply divided @entity75			1
a key political aim involves republicans hoping to attract more hispanics to their side , while @entity13 wishing to keep that growing voter bloc squarely in their camp			0
@entity82 voted overwhelmingly for president @entity48 's re-election			1
he congratulated the committee on its work and urged the @entity2 to bring the bill to the floor at its earliest possible opportunity			2
" the legislation that passed the @entity2 with a strong bipartisan vote is largely consistent with the principles of commonsense reform i have proposed and meets the challenge of fixing our broken immigration system , " he said in a statement			1
" @entity99 members got everything they wanted , and neither did i , but in the end , we all owe it to the @entity104 people to get the best possible result over the finish line			0
" the measure approved by the @entity2 panel would create a 13 - year path to citizenship for most of the country 's 11 million undocumented immigrants			1
@entity114 immigration talks foundering , @entity43 warns it aims to strengthen border security while raising the cap on visas for high skilled workers and establishing a new visa program for low skilled workers on @entity104 's farms and elsewhere			0
proponents say the change is necessary to permanently and fairly resolve the status of undocumented residents			0
critics insist the proposed change amounts to amnesty , rewarding those who chose to break the country 's immigration laws			0
sen. @entity131 , @entity132 , is leading the charge against the " @entity10 " proposal and is a tough critic			2
he has tried to derail the bill at nearly every turn , arguing that adding millions of newly legalized workers to the mix over the next few years will only hurt the most vulnerable segments of the @entity104 work force			0
he also has raised security and other concerns			0
" this will be a hammer blow to the wages and employment opportunities of @entity104 workersâ € ” both immigrant and native born , " @entity131 said in a statement after the vote			0
" this bill is bad for workers , bad for taxpayers andâ € ” as immigration officers have pleaded for us to hearâ € ” a threat to public safety and the rule of law , " he said			2
in a defeat for backers of expanded gay rights , the committee did not approve a pair of @entity24 - sponsored amendments bolstering federal support for bi-national same - sex relationships			1
specifically , @entity24 had proposed recognizing same - sex marriages in which one spouse is an @entity104 , and allowing @entity104 citizens to sponsor foreign - born same - sex partners for green cards given proof of a committed relationship			0
@entity177 sen. @entity176 , the most prominent @entity43 in the " @entity10 , " was among those who called @entity24 's amendments a poison pill virtually certain to destroy @entity43 support for the measure			1
immigration bill is @entity13 plot , @entity114 conservative says @entity24 's amendments could be considered again when the bill is taken up by the full @entity2			1
doing so , however , would be little more than a symbolic gesture , as the proposals have virtually no chance of winning the 60 votes almost certainly needed to clear the 100 - member chamber			0
earlier this month , sen. @entity193 , @entity194 , noted the possibility that an upcoming ruling by the @entity104 @entity197 on the @entity198 could render the whole issue moot			0
" the @entity198 ruling could change this whole debate , " @entity193 said			0
" they could eliminate @entity198 and impose obligations on our federal government ( relating to ) same gender marriage , and that would dramatically change what we 're trying to achieve			0
" the @entity114 is working on its own version of immigration reform .			1
