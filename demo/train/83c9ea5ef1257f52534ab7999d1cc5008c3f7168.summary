-- @entity2 's @entity1 was shaking saturday			0
nearly 70,000 of the @entity6 ' famously vocal fans registered on two seismometers , devices that measure motions of the ground , typically for earthquakes , installed for an @entity13 playoff game against the @entity14			1
it helped , of course , that @entity2 won 23 - 15			1
the @entity18 webpage explained why the seismometers were placed in the stadium : " this is an experiment to investigate how an excited crowd energizes the stadium structure to shake , and how that shaking propagates into the surrounding ground			2
" the stadium set a @entity26 for noise at an outdoor stadium last september , and went seismic last month in another game against @entity31 , registering at a recording station about a block from the stadium			0
@entity2 fans also shook the earthquake recording station during a game in 2011			2
once again , the opponent was the @entity14			1
last month 's game hit in the magnitude 1 - to - 2 range , @entity39 , a professor at the @entity40 and the director of the @entity18 , said at the time			2
the magnitude for the playoff game was a little higher , he said saturday , going on to explain that the instruments responded to the stomping and yelling of the fans			1
" this game outclassed the game of a few weeks ago and was comparable to the game from three years ago , " @entity39 said			0
seismometers respond to vibrations , not noise , he said			1
" we measure what you can feel as vibrations , " he said			0
" we do n't read high frequency , as what people can hear			0
" it 's happened before , in @entity62 , of all places			0
in 1988 , fans at @entity65 in @entity66 rocked the bayou in a come - from - behind victory over @entity69 , registering on the campus seismograph .			1
