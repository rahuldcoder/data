@entity0 -- judging by a preview event at this year 's @entity4 , one big gadget trend this year will be sensors that track almost everything in your daily life			1
there are sensors to track your home , your security systems , your pets , your plants , your weight and , in the case of a new " smart fork , " even how fast you eat			1
@entity4 , the world 's biggest electronics trade show , officially opens its doors tuesday and runs through friday			1
but at sunday 's preview event here , select companies offered the first real peek at what kinds of products we 're likely to see the most over the week			1
here are five of the more fun gadgets we spotted			0
the smart fork that slows you down the @entity33 from @entity34 is smarter than your typical eating utensil			1
in addition to the standard stabbing of meat and ferrying of food from the plate to your mouth , this fork tracks how many bites you take , how fast you take them and the length of your meal			1
if you are eating too fast , the fork will let you know with a vibration and a blinking light , eventually training you to take your time			1
eating more slowly can help people lose weight ( there 's more time to feel full ) , and also help them digest food better			1
@entity58 engineer @entity57 invented the connected eating implement after his family chided him for eating too quickly			0
he spent three years searching for the right sensor , eventually settling on one that completes a circuit every time your mouth closes over the end of the fork			1
naturally , the @entity33 comes with a mobile app and webpage for tracking your noshing habits			0
a @entity73 is also in development			0
the fork will cost $ 99 when it becomes available in april , and the founders are planning a @entity78 campaign for february			1
trends to look for at @entity4 a hub for your connected home there are seemingly no limits to the things in your home , such as temperature and lights , you can track and control remotely with sensors			1
but there are not many good ways to coordinate all of that data , short of having an app for each and every device			1
the @entity97 system from @entity99 's acts as a hub for a connected home			2
with the one mobile app you can control and check all your household sensors , or you can program @entity97 to send you text - message alerts when , say , your back door is open			1
in addition to thermostat and security sensors , @entity106 will help you monitor carbon monoxide levels , water heaters , pet doors and the moisture levels of your house plants			2
@entity99 's promises more sensors to come from such third parties as @entity117 , @entity118 and @entity119			2
if you doubt the need for a connected home , check out the @entity123 service			2
it lets you monitor an elderly family member 's home and sends you a text message if anything unusual is detected			2
there 's also an emergency alert button your relative can wear around his or her neck			0
@entity134 reveals self - driving car track your lost luggage anywhere @entity137 is like @entity138 for your luggage			1
the small black and orange box is preprogrammed with your phone numbers and dropped into a piece of checked luggage			2
if you arrive at an airport but your duffel does n't , you can check its location online with the @entity137 app , or get its location sent to you via text message or e-mail			0
the device transmits the location using a sim card , so a few special features had to be worked in to make it @entity157 compliant			2
the @entity137 automatically goes into sleep mode when it hits 100 knots and wakes up when the plane is at the destination gate			0
the @entity163 costs $ 50 , plus an annual $ 13 service fee and a one - time $ 9 setup fee			2
if you 're a frequent flier who has been wronged by incompetent airlines , you may find it a good investment to let you know if your bag is in @entity172 when it 's supposed to be in @entity173			0
@entity138 case is all touch sure , the front of your @entity138 is touch sensitive , but all that other surface area is just boring old metal , right ? not anymore			0
the @entity181 case from @entity182 adds touch features to the sides and back of your @entity138 , turning it into one big touchtastic device			0
when used with compatible apps , the case adds some interesting navigation and scrolling options			0
it shines most with games , allowing more interactive play without your big fingers blocking the touchscreen			0
the device will need more dedicated apps to be truly useful , but @entity182 has released a few of its own apps to show off its features and potential			1
there 's a glut of @entity138 cases out there , so it 's nice to see a new entry that adds to the smartphone experience instead of just dressing up the phone			0
the case starts at $ 59 , and the company says it is working on @entity213 versions			0
the history of @entity4 celebrity gadgets smart glasses , but not @entity217 's the @entity219 smart glasses bring the power and features of a smartphone directly to your eyeballs			1
the company has been working on a prototype of these specs for a year and is now showing off a working model at @entity4			1
@entity229 says it 's close to what the final version will be			0
the glasses run @entity234 4.0 and can be used to make calls , watch videos and navigate a computer interface			0
the device has all the fixings , including @entity240 , @entity241 , @entity242 and 720p video recording			0
@entity229 hopes to have the glasses available by this summer for @entity234 and @entity245 .			0
