@entity0 , @entity1 -- supporters of slain teen @entity4 and his acknowledged killer continued tuesday to battle over the significance of evidence in the case			1
a @entity4 family attorney insisted tuesday that the former prosecutor in the case met with the now sidelined police chief to discuss the case hours after @entity4 died , overruling a police detective who the family says prepared an affidavit urging that neighborhood watch captain @entity15 be arrested			1
meanwhile , a friend of @entity15 's told @entity2 that video of the neighborhood watch volunteer in police custody does seem to show injuries consistent with @entity15 's report that @entity4 slammed his head to the concrete after the two exchanged words			1
@entity27 agents were in @entity0 on tuesday , continuing their interviews in a civil rights investigation of the case , which @entity4 family supporters say is a clear - cut case of racial profiling leading to an unjust killing			1
one of the people they met with tuesday is @entity36 , @entity15 's neighbor and friend			1
on monday , agents interviewed @entity4 's girlfriend , the 16 - year - old girl who , phone records show , was on the line with him shortly before the fatal confrontation , @entity4 family attorney @entity40 confirmed tuesday			1
special prosecutor @entity44 's investigation also continued			2
@entity4 's family and supporters say @entity15 , who is @entity47 , profiled @entity4 , who was black , as " suspicious " and ignored a police dispatcher 's request that he not follow him			1
@entity4 had a bag of @entity51 and an iced tea at the time of his death			2
the 28 - year - old neighborhood watch volunteer has said he killed the unarmed 17 - year - old in self - defense , saying the teen punched him and slammed his head into a sidewalk before the shooting , according to family members and police			1
rallies nationwide have called for @entity15 's arrest , decrying the @entity67 's handling of the case			1
@entity15 's legal adviser , @entity69 , said on tuesday that criminal defense lawyer @entity70 would represent @entity15 and that @entity69 would serve as co-counsel if the case were to proceed			1
@entity70 spent more than six years with the @entity72 in @entity1 before graduating from law school in 1974			0
in an interview with @entity76 in @entity77 , both lawyers said they had communicated with @entity15 only by telephone			2
@entity69 said @entity15 , who has not appeared publicly since the shooting , was concerned about " people who will do him harm			2
" on tuesday , @entity4 family attorney @entity83 insisted again that the former prosecutor in the case , state attorney @entity84 , met with the now sidelined @entity0 police chief on the night of the killing and overruled a police detective urging that @entity15 be arrested			1
in a letter delivered monday to the @entity92 , the @entity4 family said the @entity0 police detective " filed an affidavit stating that he did not find @entity15 's statements credible in light of the circumstances and facts surrounding the shooting			1
" the @entity4 family said @entity0 police chief @entity101 and state attorney @entity84 met the night of the shooting and disregarded the detective 's advice , allowing @entity15 to remain free			1
@entity105 has reported that the lead homicide investigator , @entity106 , filed an affidavit pushing for charges the night of the killing , but was overruled by the state attorney 's office			1
neither @entity0 police nor prosecutors have confirmed the existence of such an affidavit			0
@entity0 officials and special prosecutor @entity116 declined to comment			0
on tuesday , @entity117 said she had not seen a copy of the affidavit , but said she believed several news organizations had			0
but @entity84 , who stepped aside in the case last month , vehemently denied that any " such meeting or communication occurred " between him and @entity101			2
" i am outraged by the outright lies contained in the letter by @entity129 , " a @entity4 family attorney , @entity84 said in a statement monday			1
" i have been encouraging those spreading the irresponsible rhetoric to stop and allow state attorney @entity44 to complete her work , " he said			1
" another falsehood distributed to the media does nothing to forward that process			0
" @entity117 said the family 's legal team has multiple , credible sources who say @entity84 and @entity101 met that night			1
the two sides also argued tuesday over surveillance video showing @entity15 in police custody after the shooting			1
an enhanced copy of the video appears to show a bump , mark or injury on @entity15 's head more clearly than does another copy of the video previously reviewed by @entity2			1
that video had a grainy quality			0
while the video does not appear to show major wounds , @entity36 , @entity15 's neighbor and friend , said @entity160 paramedics cared for @entity15 before they released him to police			1
" that 's why you do n't see him like he came out of a 12 - round fight like @entity165 against @entity166 , " @entity36 said			1
but @entity117 , the @entity4 family attorney , said tuesday that it does n't matter what the videotape shows			1
" that does not change our position , " she said			0
" once again , @entity15 was the aggressor			2
he pursued @entity4 in this instance			2
if he did have any medical injuries , that did not give him the right to use deadly force and shoot and kill @entity4			2
" also tuesday , @entity36 told @entity2 that the neighborhood had experienced a spate of burglaries over 15 months , which he said were committed by black men			1
but @entity36 said @entity15 was not a racist			1
" young black men were never the topic of discussion , " he said			0
it was that neighborhood homes had been repeatedly burglarized , he said			0
police records did n't appear to support @entity36 's assertion , describing four incidents involving black men			1
@entity36 declined further comment to @entity2			2
the continued discussion over recorded evidence carried over from monday , when a major point of debate was a 911 call placed on the night @entity4 was killed			2
@entity15 has said he was yelling for help , according to his family members and his account to authorities , as first reported by the @entity204 and later confirmed by @entity0 police			1
but @entity4 's relatives , including his cousin @entity207 , have said they are certain the voice heard on the 911 call is @entity4 's			1
audio experts @entity211 and @entity212 , who analyzed the recordings for the @entity204 using different techniques , said they do n't believe it is @entity15 who is heard yelling in the background of one 911 call			2
they compared the screams with @entity15 's voice , as recorded in a 911 call he made minutes earlier describing a " suspicious " black male			1
" there 's a huge chance that this is not @entity15 's voice , " said @entity212 , a longtime audio engineer who is listed as an expert in recorded evidence by the @entity223			1
" after 28 years of doing this , i would put my reputation on the line and say this is not @entity15 screaming			2
" what witnesses say @entity211 , a forensic audio analyst and chairman emeritus of the @entity233 , also said he does not believe the screams came from @entity15			2
he cited software that is widely used in @entity236 and has become recently accepted in the @entity237 that examines characteristics like pitch and the space between spoken words to analyze voices			0
using it , he found a 48 % likelihood the voice is @entity15 's			2
at least 60 % is necessary to feel confident two samples are from the same source , he told @entity2 on monday -- meaning it 's unlikely it was @entity15 who can be heard yelling			2
the experts , both of whom said they have testified in cases involving audio analysis , stressed they can not say who was screaming			0
but @entity2 and @entity258 legal analysts @entity256 and @entity259 raised questions about what the public should consider regarding the conclusions reached			0
@entity259 said several questions and variables must be considered , including the fact the tests did not analyze similar speech			0
that is , the analysis was based on screams heard from a distance in a 911 call , compared with a direct phone conversation @entity15 had with a 911 operator			0
" ideally , you want ( @entity15 or @entity4 's ) voice saying the same exact thing , screaming ' help ! ' in order to analyze it , " she said			1
would these tests be admissible in court and considered evidence ? " it really depends on the individual judge , " @entity259 said			0
" in @entity1 , they are going to conduct a @entity289 test , the legal test , which asks if the science is generally accepted in the community			0
" @entity256 questioned whether the test stood up to the voice - comparison standards of the @entity233			0
the standards indicate that , when analyzing speech , there should be a minimum of at least 10 words to be compared with each other in order to say you can have a " possible elimination " conclusion			0
but in this case , the cries for help do n't have nearly that number of words			0
@entity211 said the published @entity237 board of recorded evidence standards apply only partially to the kind of test he conducted			0
" these standards apply to the older aural - spectrographic analysis and software , " @entity211 said			0
" this only partially applies to the biometric software			0
" both @entity256 and @entity259 urged caution in reaching any conclusions about the findings of @entity212 and @entity211			0
" i do think we need to take a step back , as with most of the facts in this case , and look at it the way the court would , " @entity259 said			0
" and that is by asking if the circumstances of how , and if , the test was done , ok , and wait to determine whether it 's reliable			0
" the ongoing friction from the incident has continued to divide @entity0 and the country			0
but @entity0 mayor @entity334 said tuesday he senses that people in his community are ready to start trying to move on			0
" i think there 's a big portion of the city that are trying to get to the healing mode , " he said			0
@entity2 's @entity341 , @entity342 , @entity343 , @entity344 , @entity345 and @entity346 contributed to this report			0
