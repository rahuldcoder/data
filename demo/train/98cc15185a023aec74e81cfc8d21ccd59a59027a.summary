-- @entity1 continued her run of tough three - set victories thursday while @entity4 maintained her flawless record of not dropping a set as the contrasting pair made it through to the title match at the @entity9			1
the statuesque 1.88 meter @entity1 took two hours and 40 minutes to see off the semifinal challenge of @entity11 , who came close to upsetting a player she idolized as a youngster growing up in @entity14			2
fourth seed @entity4 , a bundle of pugnacious energy at just 1.68 meters , was merely detained for 90 minutes in dispatching @entity19 's @entity18 6 - 2 7 - 6 on the same @entity20			1
the 22 - year - old @entity4 is the first @entity21 to reach a grand slam final in 34 years			2
@entity23 's @entity1 will be playing in her eighth , including her third in a row at the @entity9 , having won the title in 2012 and lost to @entity27 last year			1
@entity1 has beaten @entity4 on the three occasions they have played , including the final on clay in @entity32 earlier this year , but she will need to avoid the slow starts that have made her passage to the final so testing			2
@entity11 , just a few centimeters shorter than @entity1 and with the same powerful ground strokes , looked set to cause an upset when she achieved two breaks of service to take the opener 6 - 4			1
seventh seed @entity1 steadied her nerves by taking an early break in the second set , but when @entity11 hit back to level at 5 - 5 it might have raised doubts for a lesser player than the four - time grand slam winner			1
she responded in the style of a champion by breaking @entity11 again to win the second set 7 - 5 before racing into a lead she never surrendered in the decider			1
@entity11 , who was playing in her second straight grand slam semifinal -- losing to eventual winner @entity55 in @entity56 -- bravely saved four match points at 2 - 5 down but succumbed on the fifth			1
@entity1 had repeated her feat of her previous two matches against @entity62 and then @entity63 , who shocked title holder @entity27 in the second round , by coming back from a set down to prevail			0
after her victory , the 27 - year - old @entity1 paid tribute to her 18th - seeded opponent			2
" she played an unbelievable match			0
her level was extremely high today and i am just fortunate to be the winner , " @entity1 said in her court side interview			0
" i would prefer to win in two sets , but she started so well			0
it was tough losing the first set , but that 's not when the match is over			0
" @entity4 , whose manager @entity81 was champion at @entity9 in 1978 and runner - up two years later to @entity83 , was never seriously troubled against the @entity19 28th seed @entity18			1
she raced to a 4 - 1 lead in just 14 minutes with two breaks of service and quickly closed out the opener			2
@entity18 rallied to lead 3 - 1 in the set but gave up the advantage immediately and always trailed in the tiebreak , which she lost 7 - 4			1
" it 's very emotional to win and reach my first grand slam final , " said @entity4			0
" @entity18 's a great player but i think i was a little bit stronger			0
i tried my best and did everything i could to win the match			0
" @entity4 has risen swiftly through the ranks and won sixth titles in 2013 to be named the @entity101 's most improved player			0
a promising junior , her career stalled until she had breast reduction surgery four years ago , helping her to increase her athleticism around the court , much in evidence on her favorite surface of clay .			0
