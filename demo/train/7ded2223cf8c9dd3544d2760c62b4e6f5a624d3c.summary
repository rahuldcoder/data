-- efforts to remove cats from @entity3 , a @entity5 island and @entity6 , have indirectly led to environmental devastation , according to a report published in the @entity9			1
@entity10 on @entity3 in 2007 shows lack of vegetation on the island compared to 2001 ... the removal of cats has led to a boom in the island 's rabbit population -- another species introduced by humans -- causing widespread devastation to the island 's vegetation			1
according to the study 's lead author , dr. @entity25 of the @entity26 : " satellite images show substantial island - wide rabbit - induced vegetation change			1
by 2007 , impacts on some protected valleys and slopes had become acute			0
we estimate that nearly 40 percent of the whole island area had changed , with almost 20 percent having moderate to severe change			0
" the removal of the invasive species from @entity3 , situated halfway between @entity39 and @entity40 , also serves as a wider warning about human interference in ecosystems and how good intentions can go awry			1
it is a case from which important lessons must be learned , according to the report 's authors			0
the scientists behind the study claim that the @entity3 is a rare example of so - called " trophic cascades " -- the knock - on effects of changes in one species ' abundance across several links in the food chain			2
as well as species extinction , in extreme cases it can even lead to an ecosystem " meltdown "			0
" this study is one of only a handful which demonstrate that theoretically plausible trophic cascades associated with invasive species removal not only do take place , but can also result in rapid and detrimental changes to ecosystems , so negating the direct benefits of the removal of the target species , " says @entity25			1
@entity3 was discovered in 1810 with the remote island 's seal and penguin population targeted for the fur trade			1
cats were introduced to the island soon after to eat rats and mice that threatened to eat the sailors ' grain stores			2
it was sealing gangs who then brought rabbits to the island in 1878 to give sailors something to eat			0
the rabbits provided easy prey for the island 's cats , helping their number to grow , but the rabbit population was also causing catastrophic damage to the island 's vegetation			1
@entity102 , a disease fatal to rabbits was introduced to the island in 1968 to try and curb their number			2
it worked at first as rabbit numbers fell from a peak of 130,000 in 1978 to less than 20,000 ten years later and vegetation recovered			0
however , with fewer rabbits as food , the cats began to eat the island 's native burrowing birds , so a cat eradication program began in 1985			2
the last cat on the island was killed in 2000 , and @entity102 had failed to keep rabbit numbers in check ; their numbers bounced back and in little over six years rabbits substantially altered large areas of the island			0
according to @entity25 : " increased rabbit herbivory has caused substantial damage at both local and landscape scales including changes from complex vegetation communities , to short , grazed lawns or bare ground			0
" @entity25 hopes that the problems facing @entity3 are a cautionary tale for conservation agencies : " interventions should be comprehensive , and include risk assessments to explicitly consider and plan for indirect effects , or face substantial subsequent cost , " says @entity25			1
the cost to remedy the problems of @entity3 is estimated at $ 16 million .			0

*absence* of cats left rabbit population to devastate @entity3 's vegetation
cats and rabbits are invasive species introduced to the island in 19th century
*sub-antarctic* @entity3 provides cautionary tale of interventions and risks
