gov. @entity0 beefed up @entity2 's gun - control laws on tuesday by signing into law a new package of firearm and mental health regulations that mark the nation 's first since last month 's massacre in @entity8 , @entity9			1
@entity0 , a self - described gun owner , said the december 14 tragedy spurred lawmakers to action and called it a " common sense " measure before enacting what are widely seen as @entity18 's toughest gun laws			1
" you can overpower the extremists with intelligence and common sense , " he said before inking the deal in @entity20			0
the laws fortify @entity2 's existing assault weapons ban , limit the number of bullets allowed in magazines and strengthen rules that govern the mentally ill , which includes a requirement to report potentially harmful behavior			1
@entity34 sheriff : ' unconstitutional ' gun control laws wo n't be enforced both the @entity38 - controlled @entity37 and @entity39 - dominated @entity36 approved the measure by overwhelming margins just one week after @entity0 spelled out the proposals in his annual state of the state address			1
the first - term @entity45 governor had called for a tightening of the assault weapons ban , background checks for people who purchase guns privately and more restrictions on high - capacity magazines			2
but the new measures drew ire from the nation 's largest gun lobby over the speed with which the bill was passed in the new legislative session			2
the @entity59 accused @entity0 and other state lawmakers of orchestrating " a secretive end - run around the legislative and democratic process			1
" after two days of voting in the state legislature , @entity0 signed the deal around 5 p.m. before telling reporters that speed had been essential so as not to create a rush on the gun market			1
" there has been all sorts of reports that even the contemplation of this law caused an increase in ( gun ) sales , " he said			2
" that would have been the exact opposite of what we were trying to achieve			0
" related : details of @entity84 's proposals the new laws include a statewide gun registry and a uniform licensing standard , altering the current system in which each county or municipality sets its own standard			1
residents are now restricted to purchasing ammunition magazines that carry seven bullets , rather than 10			1
related : @entity59 's shooting video prompts outrage it remains unclear what effect the measures will have on @entity2 's already stringent approach to gun control			1
" the changes in @entity2 are largely cosmetic , " said @entity103 legal analyst @entity102 , who described existing regulations as " the toughest gun laws in the @entity18			0
" " the one change that arguably will have the greatest impact is the amendment to @entity110 , which will permit closer monitoring of the mentally ill. " that 1999 law grants @entity2 judges the authority to require residents to undergo psychiatric treatment if they meet certain criteria			0
related : gun control support rises but divide remains over what to do the new measures will extend @entity110 through 2017 , expand outpatient treatment from six months to a year and require reviews before such treatment is allowed to expire			2
@entity2 's mental health professionals will be governed by a new and controversial set of rules that require them to report their patients to the state should those patients exhibit behavior suggesting that they could be harmful to themselves or others			0
" we 're opening up an unprecedented window into what goes on in the therapy room , " said dr. @entity135 , director of the @entity136 at the @entity137			0
" it would effect a major change in the usual presumptions of confidentiality			0
" the bill creates mandatory life sentences for anyone who murders certain first responders , a provision that comes after two firefighters were killed in an ambush as they battled a blaze in @entity156			0
the vote coincides with a series of recommendations put together by vice president @entity160 meant to address the nation 's gun violence			0
