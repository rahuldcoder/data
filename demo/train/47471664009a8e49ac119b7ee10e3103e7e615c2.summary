-- @entity1 is emerging as a tragic hero of @entity4 conservatism : so much potential , such bad luck			1
his victories tuesday night demonstrate what might have happened if the @entity9 had coalesced around him for the past month instead of the hyperbolic @entity10			0
but a counting error in @entity12 delayed his momentum , and it 's only now that the @entity14 are realizing just how good a candidate he can be			1
unlike @entity17 , @entity1 is more than just an @entity19 vote			2
people actually seem to like him , and it might have something to do with those nostalgic sweater vests that he wears			0
combined with his old school moralism , he sometimes comes off like a sitcom dad of the " no long - haired hippie is gon na date my daughter ! " variety			0
while @entity31 's victory speeches are polished tedium , @entity1 's sound like they 're being shouted angrily at a terrified prom date running for his life down the asphalt drive			1
beyond the great visuals , @entity1 is also very good at articulating how conservatives feel about things			2
@entity31 's rhetoric is full of sunbeams and star - spangled banners ; the coziness of his brand is epitomized by the fact that 2 % of @entity4 think his first name is @entity48			1
in contrast , @entity1 's voice quivers with a righteous anger that is more appropriate to this political season			1
most conservatives do n't see the economic issues framing this election as being purely about economics			0
they see a cultural dimension to @entity58 that poses a challenge to their way of life -- and @entity1 taps into that			1
he 's done a great job of exploiting the administration 's attempt to require @entity68 organizations to provide contraception coverage to their employees , ratcheting up the rhetoric and calling the president a latter - day @entity72			0
his charge that @entity31 likewise mandated @entity68 hospitals to provide emergency contraception to rape victims exploits @entity9 suspicions that @entity79 and @entity80 are interchangeable			2
it 's notable that @entity1 's breakthrough has come in the @entity14 @entity84 heartland			1
he 's made a case that @entity31 is a @entity9 , and many people are buying it			1
the mix of fury and folksy is working wonders for @entity1 this week , but can he take it all the way to the convention ? probably not			2
tuesday 's contests gave him no delegates and were won under special circumstances			0
@entity10 was n't even on the ballot in @entity98 , and it helped that @entity17 and @entity31 put all their resources into @entity102 and @entity103 , which allowed @entity1 to focus exclusively on tuesday 's caucuses and manufacture a little momentum on the sly			1
even with these wins under his belt , @entity1 will struggle to catch @entity31			1
the two big primaries left this month are @entity108 and @entity109 , states that heavily favor mittens			0
@entity1 is rising fast in national polls ( up 5 % in a few days , according to @entity113 ) but is still in fourth place			2
his bigger problem is that consensus rests with @entity17 being the heavyweight anti-romney candidate			0
@entity1 has to overcome a fear about splitting the conservative vote if he is to emerge as the right - winger du jour			1
all this amounts to @entity1 being the " coulda - shoulda - woulda " candidate of 2012			2
if only his victory in @entity12 had been reported accurately , he might have had bigger momentum going in to @entity123 and @entity102			1
and if only conservatives had coalesced around him rather than @entity17 , he would be the front - runner			0
and if only @entity14 voted on the basis of what they believe in rather than what they think is electable ... the possibilities are fascinating but will probably be largely academic			0
join the conversation on @entity134			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity137 .			0

@entity137 says @entity1 is tragic conservative *steeped* in potential -- and bad luck
he says @entity1 *popular* , but @entity14 denied him momentum by @entity14 after @entity12 results *snafu*
he says @entity1 's @entity84 victories still leave him *chasing* @entity31 , who 's well positioned
@entity137 : if @entity14 *backed* him , if @entity12 results had been accurate , he might have had momentum
