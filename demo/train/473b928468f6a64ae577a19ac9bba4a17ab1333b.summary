@entity0 -- @entity4 will soon complete its official investigation into last week 's massacre in @entity7 , the country 's @entity0 ambassador said wednesday			1
" the national commission of investigation in @entity4 will terminate its investigation tomorrow or after tomorrow , " @entity8 told reporters at the @entity0			1
" and then you will hear , all of you ... the results of this investigation			0
and all of us will know for sure the identity of the perpetrators			0
" @entity4 officials have repeatedly denied government involvement in the massacre that left more than 100 people dead , about half of them children			1
but @entity26 , spokesman for the @entity0 human rights office , said tuesday that it 's " clear " government forces were involved			1
most died as a result of " summary executions " by " armed men going into houses and killing men , women and children inside , " @entity26 said , saying the @entity36 militia , a government militia group , appeared to be behind the executions			2
@entity39 , the @entity40 ambassador to the @entity0 , said the massacre was carried out " by every indication , by the @entity36 militias acting on behalf of the government			1
we think it 's quite clear - cut			2
" since the conflict began more than a year ago , president @entity49 's regime has blamed violence against civilians on " armed terrorist groups , " a line @entity8 continued wednesday			1
those behind the " heinous crime , " which was " unjustified and unjustifiable , " will be brought to justice , @entity8 said			1
he also argued that other countries are supporting groups that are smuggling weapons into @entity4			1
the remarks came after a meeting of the @entity64 , in which countries sought new ways to increase the pressure on the regime			0
@entity68 said after the meeting , " we certainly agree with @entity71 that this is a moment where we have reached , in effect , a tipping point			0
" air strikes would wreck @entity49 , says former @entity4 general @entity71 , special envoy to @entity4 for the @entity0 and the @entity77 , who has pushed a six - point peace plan , used the phrase " tipping point " tuesday			1
" i think we may be beginning to see the wheels coming off of this bus , " @entity68 said			0
" and that means that what happens next and the steps that are taken by the @entity4 authorities and by this council could well be dispositive			2
" " the political process , which is so crucial to the success of any transition , which is the purpose of the @entity71 plan , is thwarted by the ongoing , escalating , expanding violence perpetrated by the government , and the reality that the opposition can not possibly be expected to come to the table while the violence is intensifying , escalating and the government is lying about it , " she said			2
but @entity8 insisted that his government was doing all it could to protect @entity4 's citizenry			1
" we are facing terrorist armed groups -- trained , financed , harbored and protected by some countries in the area -- @entity110 countries , regional countries and internationally speaking also			0
" eleven nations -- the @entity40 , the @entity113 , @entity114 , @entity115 , @entity116 , @entity117 , @entity118 , @entity119 , @entity120 , @entity121 and @entity122 -- announced tuesday that they were expelling @entity4 diplomats			1
@entity125 joined that list wednesday , expelling the charge d'affaires and other diplomatic personnel from @entity4 's embassy in @entity130			1
in turn , @entity4 said wednesday it was expelling the @entity113 charge d'affaires from @entity133 , giving her 72 hours to leave the country			2
@entity8 said the diplomatic moves against @entity4 were not helping the situation			1
" sanctions , expulsions of diplomats -- this is not diplomacy , " he said			1
" diplomacy is totally different			0
" @entity144 called the expulsions of @entity4 diplomats " counterproductive " and insisted that a @entity64 statement sunday condemning the incident was " a strong enough signal to the @entity4 parties			1
" a central question hanging over the @entity64 meeting is what steps @entity144 and @entity152 will countenance			0
as permanent members , they have veto power , which they have used previously to block two resolutions			0
many world leaders assailed the two nations , saying they were preventing steps that could stop the violence			0
but the two countries said they were seeking more balanced resolutions			0
both have major trade deals with @entity4			2
while no nation is openly pushing for military action , @entity116 president @entity165 has said it can not be ruled out			0
@entity40 sticking with ' @entity168 ' for @entity4 @entity152 and @entity144 spoke out wednesday against such an idea			1
" @entity152 opposes military intervention and does not support forced regime change , " said @entity170 , a @entity171 spokesman			0
" the fundamental route to resolving the @entity4 issue is still for all sides to fully support @entity71 's mediation efforts and push all the relevant parties to carry out diplomatic dialogue			1
" " one can not take decisions on military operations in @entity4 by being guided by only emotions , " said @entity144 first deputy foreign minister @entity180 , according to @entity144 news agency @entity181			2
@entity180 also said " the @entity144 position is not formed on the basis of emotions , which our respected @entity116 partners have unfortunately not escaped in the formulation of their position , " according to @entity144 news outlet @entity191			0
in @entity195 , @entity194 deputy spokesman @entity193 said @entity40 officials were not putting all their hopes into the @entity71 plan			2
" we 're also continuing with these other options that we 're pursuing , which is support for the opposition , humanitarian assistance , working through the ( opposition group ) @entity205 to increase financial and political pressure on @entity49 , " he said			0
in a statement from a spokesman , the @entity207 said it was giving the @entity4 regime until noon on friday to implement the @entity64 resolutions or it would stop complying with them			2
" immediately halting gunfire and all violence , pulling out all the troops , tanks and machinery from the cities , towns and residential areas , allowing humanitarian aid to reach all stricken areas , releasing all prisoners and allowing media access , guaranteeing the freedom to demonstrate , not attacking the @entity0 monitors like what happened in several areas , and entering true and serious dialogue through the @entity0 in order to hand over the power to the people , " said the spokesman , col. @entity213			2
" our national , moral and humanitarian duty make it necessary for us to defend and protect our civilians and their cities , towns , blood , and dignity , " the statement said			0
" and this right to protect ourselves does not go against international laws and norms			0
" the @entity40 announced wednesday it was sanctioning a @entity4 bank that @entity49 's regime was using to circumvent other sanctions			1
the @entity246 said its action will help isolate the regime			0
@entity40 intervention : damned if they do , damned if they do n't ? @entity252 , @entity117 's @entity0 ambassador , said he hoped the @entity7 massacre was " an eye - opener for some members of the council			1
" he said he hoped the council would consider expanding the @entity0 monitoring mission in @entity4			1
also , he asked , " how does the council deal with violations of its own resolutions ? because the massacre in @entity7 was a clear violation of the @entity64 resolution			0
" he added , " we have to exhaust all means to find a political solution , " and " militarization , for us , is not an option			0
" in @entity195 , @entity270 press secretary @entity269 took a similar tack : " right now we believe that , for example , on the issue of providing lethal aid , that that 's not the course of action that 's the right one to take for this country , " he told reporters			0
" we 're providing nonlethal assistance and humanitarian assistance in coordinating with other nations and providing support for the opposition as it forms itself			0
" since the uprising in @entity4 began nearly 15 months ago , @entity4 government forces have engaged in a crackdown on the opposition			1
at least 46 people were killed wednesday , including 14 in @entity291 , 12 in the @entity133 suburbs and 10 in @entity293 , the opposition @entity289 said			0
the @entity289 also said regime forces launched tear - gas grenades at @entity297 students and made arrests			0
meanwhile , the head of the @entity0 observer mission said 13 bodies were discovered tuesday night in the area of @entity303 , 30 miles east of @entity304 in the eastern part of the country			1
" all the bodies had their hands tied behind their backs and some appear to have been shot in the head from a short distance , " according to a statement from the office of maj. gen. @entity315			0
@entity315 called the act " appalling and inexcusable " and urged " all parties to exercise restraint and end the cycle of violence			0
" @entity4 , on the state - run news agency @entity321 , said 25 " army , law enforcement and civilian martyrs " were buried wednesday			2
also , an " armed terrorist group " attacked an oil pipeline in @entity304 , @entity321 reported			2
@entity1 can not confirm death tolls or reports of violence from @entity4 because the government limits access to the country by foreign journalists			1
@entity8 insisted @entity4 supports @entity71 's six - point plan to halt the violence in @entity4 , and reiterated that his government is acting only against terrorist groups , but finds itself in a difficult position			1
" on one hand , if we deploy our army and the law enforcement forces to protect the civilians , somebody would come and criticize us -- why are we doing that ? but if we let the people get killed by the terrorist groups , then we will be also blamed again -- why you did n't protect your civilians ? " @entity8 described the talks between @entity49 and @entity71 during the former @entity0 secretary general 's visit to @entity133 as " good , " adding that @entity4 supports his peace plan			1
but , @entity8 said , other nations must cooperate if peace is to be achieved			2
" president @entity49 reviewed with @entity71 the progress that has been achieved by the @entity4 government in implementing his plan , " @entity8 said			1
" however , president @entity49 reminded mr. @entity71 of the necessity to have everybody else committed to respecting his plan and to stop financing and arming and smuggling weapons into @entity4			2
" @entity1 's @entity364 , @entity365 and @entity366 contributed to this report .			0

" sanctions , expulsions of diplomats -- this is not diplomacy , " @entity8 says
@entity40 says " not *ambiguous* " that militias carried out massacre on behalf of @entity4 government
@entity117 's @entity0 ambassador : " @entity381 , for us , is not an option "
