@entity0 -- a source close to house speaker @entity3 now confirms that @entity3 was told in february 2003 by her intelligence aide , @entity4 , that waterboarding was actually used on @entity7 detainee @entity6			1
source says @entity3 did n't object about waterboard usage because she was n't personally briefed about it			1
this appears to contradict @entity3 's account that she was never told waterboarding actually happened , only that the administration was considering using it			1
@entity4 attended a briefing in which waterboarding was discussed in february 2003 , with rep. @entity17 , @entity18 , who took over @entity3 's spot as the ranking @entity20 on the @entity21			2
this source says @entity3 did n't object when she learned that waterboarding was being used because she had not been personally briefed about it -- only her aide had been told			1
the source said @entity3 supported a letter that @entity28 sent to the administration at the time raising concerns			2
