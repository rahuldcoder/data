-- in the beginning , @entity1 was a wimp			1
now , before you jump down to the comments and start flaming , this was the plan by @entity7 when the game developer started working on the latest addition to the venerable " @entity11 " franchise			1
their goal was to take you back in time , before the cool gadgets and the clever phrases and the butt - kicking and the @entity18 movies , to show how @entity1 became the action / adventure heroine everyone knows			1
in this reboot , also called " @entity11 " like the original 1996 game , @entity1 and her crew are investigating reports of strange events on an island near @entity27			1
their boat is caught up in a storm and is torn apart , stranding the castaways on the island to fend for their survival			2
@entity1 is separated from the rest of her party , and the adventure begins			1
this @entity1 is young , timid and unsure of herself when the game begins			1
only by necessity , through fighting for her survival , does she gain confidence and become the can - do woman familiar to legions of gamers			0
" @entity11 's " developers knew that they faced challenges in portraying such an iconic figure so differently from what people are used to seeing			1
even @entity1 's famously pneumatic body has been toned down to something more realistic			1
lead writer @entity50 said her team wanted to explore @entity1 's character beyond her physical accomplishments			1
" we were taking a little bit of a risk showing her when she was n't a full - blown tomb raider , " @entity50 said			0
" everyone associates @entity1 in ' @entity11 ' as being exceptionally capable , all the guns , the gadgets , the witty one - liners			1
that 's where our @entity1 is on the way to being , but we wound up so that those traits are still there , but they 're buried below the surface			1
" creative director @entity69 said the goal was not to recreate the @entity1 character but to show her at her genesis -- to tell the story of where @entity1 had come from			1
" she was still going to be a lot of the things she always was			0
she 's brilliant ; she 's resourceful ; she 's athletic ; she has an incredible force of will ; she 's an archeologist , " @entity69 said			0
" all of these things were going to be true , but we were going to roll it back to a point where she did n't have the confidence or competence or even the same belief system that she would eventually develop			0
" this more vulnerable @entity1 still does things that most " normal " people would n't do , like pull a piece of pipe from her wounded torso			2
but she is also portrayed as someone who needs reassurance and talks to herself in order to build up her own self - esteem			0
" it was important that we showed this more realistic , more human side of @entity1 , " @entity50 said			1
" she is vulnerable , because she 's human and she 's in very traumatic and chaotic circumstances in which she has to get her head around and deal with it			2
" @entity50 points to the first time @entity1 has to kill someone			2
" it has quite a big impact on her			0
something she has a big reaction to , " she said			0
" it 's very up close , and it 's very personal , and it 's uncomfortable			0
" in fact , @entity1 throws away her gun and nearly throws up because she 's taken a life -- although she later goes back to get the weapon			2
later , when talking about it with another character in the game , players get the sense of the journey they are about to experience			2
" she says it is scary how easy it was " to kill someone , @entity50 said			0
" that 's an important moment for her character , because it addresses how killing does become at that point easier			2
and she 's uncomfortable about that , too			0
it speaks to something within her that 's darker			0
" there are other moments of emotional conflict and self - doubt as the game progresses , marking the internal struggles @entity1 is going through			1
" she knows if she thinks too hard about what she 's doing , what she 's becoming , then it is going to incapacitate her , " @entity50 said			0
" but you can use combat design to underline what the characters are going through			0
" @entity7 ' goal was n't to make @entity1 less of a strong character but to show how those iconic traits about @entity1 were forged			1
" @entity1 is still a bold and strong female character , and just because you show someone in circumstances where they seem more vulnerable , it does n't make them less of a strong character , " @entity50 said			1
" it 's important that she 's brave , but bravery has to come from somewhere			2
you ca n't have bravery without fear ; otherwise , it is somewhat meaningless			0
" what we wanted to do was show where traits like her bravery , her compassion , her resourcefulness really came from			0

new " @entity11 " video game explores the origins of the @entity1 character
this @entity1 is young and unsure of herself when the game begins
