-- @entity1 sued the @entity3 government on wednesday , challenging the constitutionality of a federal law that defines marriage as the union of a man and a woman			1
the state of @entity1 says the @entity11 denies same - sex couples essential rights			1
" we 're taking this action today because , first , we believe that [ the @entity11 ] directly interferes with @entity1 ' long - standing sovereign authority to define and regulate the marital status of its residents , " attorney general @entity14 said wednesday afternoon			1
" @entity1 has a single category of married persons , and we view all married persons equally and identically , " she said			0
" @entity11 divides that category into two distinct and unequal classes of marriage			0
" the lawsuit argues that the act , which became law in 1996 , denies same - sex couples essential rights and protections , including federal income tax credits , employment and retirement benefits , health insurance coverage and @entity37 payments			1
" in enacting @entity11 , @entity41 overstepped its authority , undermined states ' efforts to recognize marriages between same - sex couples , and codified an animus towards gay and lesbian people , " the state wrote in the lawsuit , which was filed wednesday in federal court			1
@entity1 , the first state to legalize gay marriage , said that about 16,000 same - sex couples have been married there since 2004 , when it began issuing marriage licenses			2
since that time , the lawsuit said , " the security and stability of families has been strengthened in important ways throughout the state			0
" the state is challenging @entity60 of the law , which defines marriage as " a legal union between one man and one woman as husband and wife " and a spouse as " a person of the opposite sex who is a husband or a wife			2
" before the act , the lawsuit argues , defining marital status was the prerogative of the states			0
the law " eviscerated more than 200 years of federal government deference to the states with respect to defining marriage , " it said			0
the lawsuit also argues that the law forces @entity1 to treat same - sex married couples differently from heterosexual married couples , particularly through determining who qualifies for the state 's @entity91 program , known as @entity93 , and whether a same - sex spouse of a veteran can be buried in a veteran cemetery			1
" but for @entity11 , married individuals in same - sex relationships in the commonwealth would receive the same status , obligations , responsibilities , rights , and protections as married individuals in different - sex relationships under local , state , and federal laws , " the lawsuit said			1
the defendants named in the lawsuit include the @entity112 , secretary of health and human services @entity113 , the @entity114 , @entity114 secretary @entity115 and the @entity3 itself			0
@entity117 , a spokesman for the @entity118 , said the department will review the case but noted that president @entity121 supports the legislative repeal of the @entity11			0
in march , @entity123 -- the same @entity125 - based group that successfully argued in 2003 for same - sex marriage rights in @entity1 -- also sued the federal government over @entity60 of the @entity11			2
besides @entity1 , three other states recognize same - sex marriages : @entity130 , @entity131 , and @entity132			2
@entity133 and @entity134 will join their company when same - sex marriages become legal later this year and early next year .			0
