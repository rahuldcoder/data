-- if @entity5 's efficient march towards his fourth @entity7 crown left fans of motor racing 's premier competition stifling yawns , things in the top class on two wheels are rather different			1
last month , the latest in @entity13 's prodigious production line of motorcycle racers , @entity15 , looked to have the @entity17 title sewn up			1
arriving in @entity19 with a cavernous 43 - point lead over compatriot @entity21 , it seemed almost inevitable that the 20 - year - old would become the division 's youngest champion , and the first rookie to win the title since @entity27 in 1978			1
instead , the twisting undulations of @entity29 flipped the season 's story on its head			1
@entity33 , @entity17 's tire supplier , had been unable to properly test on the newly resurfaced circuit , and the teams quickly discovered that the fresh tarmac was causing their rubber to disintegrate at a dangerous rate			2
for safety , the race was reduced to 19 laps , and a mandatory bike change introduced at the halfway point			0
to widespread astonishment , @entity15 's @entity45 team misinterpreted the strict guidance on pit stops and he stayed out on track a lap too long , leading to his disqualification			2
the black flag for @entity15 may have been harsh -- a tweet from veteran rider @entity54 summed up the feelings of many fans -- but @entity45 's loss was @entity59 's gain			2
@entity21 went on to win , and suddenly the championship race was back on			1
@entity21 carved further into @entity15 's lead the following week , beating his younger rival into second place at @entity45 's home circuit in @entity65 , @entity66			1
now , as the teams arrive in @entity69 for sunday 's season finale , the title is well and truly up for grabs -- with just 13 points separating the top two			1
the most likely scenario for @entity21 to defend his title , and claim a third overall , is for the @entity77 to win the race and hope @entity15 is no higher than fifth			1
the other permutations would require @entity15 to either not finish -- which has happened only once this season , in june -- or be lower than eighth			2
however , he has been on the podium for 15 of 17 races			0
@entity83 , a former rider who is now principal of the @entity85 team he co-founded , is a big admirer of both men			0
" @entity21 is an incredible racing machine , " @entity83 told @entity0			0
" he is so sharp , he is so methodical			0
i have incredible respect for the rider			0
" however , he adds that the @entity17 paddock already considers @entity15 to be a champion			1
" for everyone it does n't matter the outcome of @entity69 , he is the world champ in terms of speed			0
and this year is really incredible , because this is happening in a year when @entity17 is so competitive ( at the top )			2
" @entity83 also notes @entity15 's startling maturity , which has given the youngster the consistency that many rookie riders struggle to deliver			1
" he is incredibly aggressive on the bike , but if you look at the record he 's not a big crasher			0
when you look at how aggressive he is , how hard he tries , and the risks he 's taking , you can see that already now he 's a very mature guy , although he 's the youngest			0
" former @entity17 rider and double @entity113 champion @entity111 agrees			2
" i 've been amazed at how he pushes the bike to the limit consistently , " @entity111 , who is now forging a career in music , told @entity0			0
" at @entity118 ( the @entity119 @entity17 , when @entity15 fell close to the end of the race while riding in a comfortable second place ) you saw an over-enthusiastic 20 - year - old , but that 's all i 've seen of that kind of personality			1
he 's been so consistent and so level - headed since then			0
" the @entity126 also sees the two @entity13 as neck and neck in the talent stakes : " i truly believe that @entity21 is more than a match for @entity15 on the same day , on the same bike , in the same conditions			1
" @entity17 is not immune to the problems @entity7 has faced with the dominance of @entity5 's @entity135			2
while an underachieving @entity138 team continues to struggle , the factory outfits of @entity45 and @entity59 are simply blowing away the opposition , so the fact that this year 's title is going to the wire will no doubt please the championship 's governing body			2
also , while the gap between @entity45 , @entity59 and the rest may be wide , there is no absence of personal rivalry at the top of the championship			0
@entity15 's relationship with third - placed teammate @entity153 is not exactly cordial , and he has consistently riled his rivals with his combative and uncompromising style			1
@entity15 was docked a point for a clash with @entity153 at @entity158 in early october , and controversially escaped censure for a rough pass on @entity21 in @entity161			1
so while @entity21 will be fighting tooth and nail for victory , @entity153 may also be less than willing to help smooth his fellow @entity166 's ride to glory			1
@entity83 doubts that any quarter will be given			0
" i 'm not so sure @entity153 is going to help @entity15 a lot , but @entity153 winning the race , that 's good news for @entity15 , " he said			1
intriguingly @entity69 is a particularly happy hunting ground for @entity153 , with a total of six wins at the track , including three in the @entity17 class			1
while his own hopes of a long - awaited first championship were ended in @entity66 , the diminutive 28 - year - old will be looking to end the season on a high			1
@entity21 has also won a @entity17 race at the track , in 2010 -- the year he won his first world title -- while @entity15 rode to victory there last season on the way to winning the @entity190 class			1
@entity83 believes that @entity192 's @entity191 , who rides for @entity85 , could also play key role along with @entity21 's seven - time world champion teammate @entity194			1
" @entity195 is going to wish to finish the season as high as possible ; he was second last year ( at @entity69 ) when he crashed four laps from the end			2
@entity194 is going to be pushing ; i 'm not sure he will play @entity21 's game			2
" the last time a @entity17 season went down to the final race was in 2006 , when @entity204 's @entity203 , then riding for @entity45 , wrested the crown from the all - conquering @entity194			1
@entity194 , in his first stint at @entity59 , fell early in the race and was unable to regain enough places to prevent @entity203 clinching what would be his first and , to date , only title			0
this time around , @entity15 will be hoping to avoid any mishaps as he looks to clinch motorcycle racing 's ultimate prize			2
" it 's going to be incredibly tense -- 13 points is good to have , but it 's not a lot , " @entity83 said			0
" it looks easier than it will be ... i think it 's 50 - 50			0
" with @entity222 heading towards winter , conditions at the track may also play a role			0
" @entity69 is a special track , " @entity83 said			0
" we know the weather this time will be difficult , there will be a lot of pressure because ( in @entity66 ) we saw @entity15 , for the first time , not being the @entity15 we know			0
he will be under more pressure at the last round			0
" in @entity21 's mind it was game over ( before @entity19 )			0
now everything has changed , @entity21 is going to go out in @entity69 not thinking , just pushing -- without any pressure			2
" for motorsport fans looking for one last fix of excitement before the season ends , sunday 's race should provide it in spades			1
" the final is going to be like a dream scenario , " @entity83 said			0
" let the sport decide			0

@entity15 *seeking* to be first rookie to win motorcycling 's premier title since 1978
the 20 - year - old has a 13 - point lead over defending @entity17 champion @entity21
they will battle head - to - head in sunday 's final race of 2013 season at @entity69
