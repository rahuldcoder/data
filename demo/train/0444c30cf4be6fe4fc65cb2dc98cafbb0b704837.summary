-- in a rare move , a senior cardinal spoke before the pope 's @entity4 address at the @entity6 on sunday , saying the pontiff maintains the support of @entity9 around the world " who do not let themselves be influenced by the gossip			1
" " today , with you are the cardinals from the @entity18 , all the bishops and priests around the world , " said cardinal @entity14 , former @entity6 secretary of state and the dean of the @entity16			1
speaking at the beginning of the @entity24 ceremony , @entity14 did not specifically mention the sexual abuse scandal that has engulfed the @entity9 in recent months			1
but his remarks clearly referred to those who have criticized @entity9 leaders , including pope @entity29 himself , for not having done much more during his years as a top official			1
@entity14 said the pope has the support of those who work in schools , hospitals and care centers , including 400,000 priests			1
" also with you are the faithful who do not let themselves be influenced by gossip , " @entity14 said in @entity38 , using the word " chiacchiericcio , " which means chatter or gossip			1
" may the lord continue to sustain your mission at the service of the church in the world			2
" in his @entity4 message , the pope did not address the scandal that encompasses high - profile abuse cases in several countries including @entity56 , @entity57 , the @entity58 , @entity59 and his native @entity60			1
more and more people have come forward complaining that as children they were victims of abuse by religious leaders , and that the church did little or nothing to stop it			2
some @entity9 leaders took the opportunity sunday to condemn the @entity9 hierarchy			1
" the lives of survivors of child sexual abuse , the faith of members of the church , and the credibility of church leadership have all been wounded grievously by the evil deeds of priests and religious who exploited their position to wreak havoc on the lives of helpless children			2
those wounds were aggravated by serious mismanagement on the part of bishops and other leaders in the @entity9 , " said @entity56 cardinal @entity86 in his homily			1
he apologized to victims and vowed to do his part to keep the safety of those in the church his overriding concern			2
in a letter last month , the pope said he was " truly sorry " for the abuse suffered by victims at the hands of @entity9 priests in @entity56			1
also sunday , @entity107 's top roman catholic bishop addressed the scandal			2
" through a guilty silence , we often preferred the reputation of certain men of the church to the honor of these abused children , " said @entity109 , archbishop of @entity110			0
" here , as well , we must , by the force of truth , give dignity back to those who were so atrociously exploited			0
" @entity60 archbishop @entity122 also brought up the scandal in his @entity4 address , saying , " we need to go down the path together and take into full view the unfathomable occurrences , the horrible crimes , the dark sides of the church and the dark parts in ourselves			1
but we can not leave it at that alone			0
we need a new beginning			0
" in a message friday on the web site of the @entity135 of @entity136 , @entity122 expressed " sadness , horror and shame , " as well as his " disappointment over the painful failure of the offenders , and that the victims were n't helped enough because of the misplaced concern about the reputation of the church			2
" the @entity135 of @entity148 and @entity149 -- once headed by pope @entity29 -- has been criticized for ignoring warnings to keep one of its priests away from children despite the man having been convicted of pedophilia			1
the priest , the rev. @entity157 , was convicted of abusing minors in 1986 , but was later allowed to continue his priestly work and to deal with children			0
a new allegation of abuse recently surfaced against @entity157 , dating from 1998 in the town of @entity164			0
cardinal @entity165 , archbishop at the time , has apologized for allowing @entity157 to work in the town after his conviction			0
the @entity60 diocese of @entity170 confirmed last month that four catholic priests and two nuns have been accused of sexually abusing children			0
five of the cases are from the 1970s and one is from the 1980s			0
@entity60 lawyers representing alleged victims say there are more than 300 cases across @entity60			0
some of the cases date back to the 1950s			0
a few priests have called for the pope to step down			2
" the ever growing sexual abuse scandal in the @entity9 has now reached the doorstep of the @entity6			1
cardinal @entity29 , now pope @entity29 , knew -- or should have known -- about pedophile priests under his authority , " the rev. @entity185 of @entity186 , @entity187 , said friday			1
while the @entity6 has emphasized @entity29 's concern about the scandal , the pontiff focused his @entity4 remarks on other issues			1
citing the story of the @entity196 , he said , " in our days too , humanity needs an ' exodus ' , not just superficial adjustment , but a spiritual and moral conversion			0
it needs the salvation of the @entity204 , so as to emerge from a profound crisis , one which requires deep change , beginning with consciences , " @entity29 said			2
he mentioned several of the world 's leading international crises , praying for an exodus from war and violence in the @entity214 and an end to suffering for @entity217 communities , especially in @entity218			1
" may the risen lord sustain the @entity220 who suffer persecution and even death for their faith , as for example in @entity225 , " he said			0
he cited the " dangerous resurgence " of drug crimes in @entity228 and the @entity229 , the " appalling tragedy " of the earthquake in @entity232 , and the " grave catastrophe " of the quake in @entity235			0
" in the strength of the risen @entity239 , may the conflicts in @entity237 come to an end , conflicts which continue to cause destruction and suffering , " the pope said , adding , " in particular i entrust to the lord the future of the @entity245 , @entity246 and @entity247			0
" he prayed for all countries affected by terrorism and discrimination , and touched on the financial crisis as well			0
" to the leaders of nations , may easter bring light and strength , so that economic and financial activity may finally be driven by the criteria of truth , justice and fraternal aid			0
" concluding his annual " @entity262 " -- " to the @entity263 and to @entity264 " -- address , @entity29 added , " @entity4 does not work magic			1
just as the @entity266 found the desert awaiting them on the far side of the @entity269 , so the @entity9 , after the resurrection , always finds history filled with joy and hope , grief and anguish			2
and yet , this history is changed , it is marked by a new and eternal covenant , it is truly open to the future			0
