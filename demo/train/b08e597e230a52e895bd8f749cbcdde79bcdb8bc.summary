@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 , a mother of six , scrubs her thin steel dishes as hard as she can with as little water as she can			1
the only way she gets water is by filling up heavy buckets from a neighborhood spigot and lugging them home			1
but once she gets it home she worries whether it is even safe to drink			0
" we get sick two to three times per month , " @entity3 said			0
" i can not afford bottled water			1
" her seven - year - old daughter , @entity15 , smiles and waves at us			0
she wants to play but is n't feeling good			0
" my stomach aches and gurgles , " she said , before talking about the many times she has been to the hospital			0
she made clear she was not fond of the injection she is often given there			0
there are about 100,000 people living in this neighborhood on @entity0 's outskirts			1
none of them has ever had water piped into their homes			1
instead the government turns on one tap three times a day			0
this is how the vast majority of the neighborhood gets access to water			1
people line up to fill their bottles and buckets , and children take showers under the flowing water			1
the tap juts out inches from a drain littered with garbage and sewage and clumps of bright green algae			0
there are a few people in the area who have installed ground water pumps , but these are illegal			1
some others get their drinking water from @entity58			1
he has made a business of providing water to residents and businesses			2
he rides his bicycle around the neighborhood every day in the baking hot sun , making five or six trips to fill a large water container strapped to the back of his bike			2
he is pouring with sweat as he makes his deliveries			0
" there is no sanitation here , just so many complaints			0
so i thought : ' let me get a water filter and supply clean water to these people , in order to help them and make some money ' , " @entity58 said			2
he charges 10 rupees -- about 18 cents -- per container , a price business owners but few others can afford to pay , as most in the neighborhood make less than $ 2 a day			2
getting clean water to drink is a struggle every day of their lives			2
@entity1 's government has long fought to provide enough clean drinking water for the masses			1
the country has 18 percent of the world 's population but only 4 percent of the world 's renewable water sources			1
at the same time major problems with leaks and pollution strip away the supply further			1
@entity103 @entity102 , an official with @entity1 's department of drinking water and sanitation , said rural @entity1 has a whole range of issues depleting its water			1
" because rural drinking water is dependent on ground water , ground water levels are going down because of exploitation by irrigation , by farmers and by industries , we are forced to drill deeper and deeper for drinking water , " he told @entity2			1
" and as we go deeper and deeper we find more and more contaminants			0
now we are finding nitrate , iron , and salinity			0
uranium is also involved in some places			0
" @entity1 has put in place a national river conservation plan aimed at pollution abatement in its rivers			1
that plan includes interception , diversion and treatment of sewage , low - cost sanitation works on riverbanks , and electric or improved wood crematoria for funerals			0
authorities admit @entity1 is facing what they call " water stress " because of urbanization , industrialization and rising population			1
according to the 2011 census , the nation 's per capita water availability stands at 1,545 cubic meters , down from 1,816 cubic meters in the 2001 population count			1
this year an acute water shortage hit the capital , @entity0			2
the city relies on other states for much of its water supply but has found itself in a tug of war to get it because other states are dealing with shortages too			2
there are still entire neighborhoods in the city where large trucks bring in the only water supply			2
thirsty crowds emerge as soon as the truck becomes visible			0
mother @entity166 fills as large a bucket as possible because the truck only comes to her neighborhood three times a week			0
underneath the water truck children squat to put little buckets which collect the drops of water spilling from the undercarriage			2
" at times there are scuffles and we have to return empty handed , " said @entity166			0
when every drop of water matters , the fight for it is ultimately a fight for survival .			0

@entity1 authorities say the country is facing " water stress "
@entity1 has 18 **%** of the world 's population but only 4 **%** of the world 's renewable water sources
demand for drinking water is growing , but pollution and leaks are depleting supplies
many *communities* rely on *standpipes* and water *tankers*
