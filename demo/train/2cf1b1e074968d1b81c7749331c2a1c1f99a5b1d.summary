-- today , the nation commemorates the 150th anniversary of @entity4 's @entity3			1
three days later , on the 50th anniversary of the assassination of @entity9 , @entity6 will recall his most moving speeches , also crisp and concise			1
the lesson is clear : to express big ideas , use few words			1
new media , such as @entity15 and texting , demand brevity			1
but brevity is also important if you 're communicating as @entity6 did before " tweet " became a noun and a verb			0
the newest technologies reinforce the oldest technique of effective writing and speaking : keep it simple			0
although the @entity3 was deceptively simple -- 10 sentences , consisting mostly of one or two - syllable words -- it communicated complex concepts			1
as the historian @entity33 has written , by stressing the egalitarian ideas of the @entity35 , " @entity4 had revolutionized the revolution , giving people a new past to live with that would change their future indefinitely			1
" @entity4 's new vision of " a new nation , conceived in liberty , " rather than a loose federation of states , foreshadowed a national government that takes the lead in protecting the rights and promoting the well - being of its citizens			2
@entity51 : learn @entity4 's words by heart almost a century later , president @entity9 looked to @entity4 's oratory as a model of clarity			1
preparing his inaugural address , @entity9 asked his speechwriter , @entity58 , to read every previous inaugural and also the @entity3			1
as @entity58 later recalled , he was impressed by how " @entity4 never used a two - or three - syllable word where a one - syllable word would do , and never used three words where one word would do			2
" @entity58 's early drafts reflected this lesson , and , as historians and memoirists have agreed , @entity9 's revisions made the speech sparer still			1
the most memorable line -- " ask not what your country can do for you , ask what you can do for your country " -- includes only one word ( used twice ) longer than one syllable			2
lesson from @entity4 : mr. president , you 're talking too much still , some despair that @entity15 has dumbed - down public speech			1
long before @entity15 , tv sound bites , telegraph dispatches and tabloid headlines all put a premium on big ideas , briefly expressed			1
the best way to grab someone 's attention has always been to say something simply			2
let 's look at some of the most memorable lines from the first inaugural addresses of four 20th century presidents			2
although written before @entity15 , they are tweet - able : 140 or fewer characters			2
and they foreshadow big ideas in their presidencies			0
50 years after @entity9 's famous ' ich bin ein @entity105 ' speech @entity9 's entire " ask not ... " takes only 78 characters , yet it is credited with motivating movements from the @entity109 to the civil rights struggle			1
in 1933 , @entity111 declared , " the only thing we have to fear is fear itself			0
" eminently tweet - able -- only 44 characters			0
and he restored @entity6 ' self - confidence , making possible the " bold , persistent experimentation " of the @entity119			0
in 1981 , @entity120 said , " @entity121 is not the solution to the problem , government is the problem			0
" with these 72 words , he set the stage for cuts in federal taxes and social programs			0
in 1993 , the most quoted line in @entity133 's inaugural was , " there is nothing wrong with @entity6 that can not be cured by what is right with @entity6			0
" the longest line of the four -- 85 characters -- but still tweet - able			0
as a speechwriter working on the inaugural address , i remember the sighs of relief when its relative brevity -- 14 minutes -- briefly convinced the @entity148 ' language maven , @entity149 , that " @entity133 proved he could edit himself , a happy augur of discipline elsewhere , " presumably in @entity133 's economic and social policies			0
to be sure , memorable lines must be rooted in thoughtful speeches			0
" ask not , " " nothing to fear , " and " government is the problem " succeeded because they were clarion calls for historic endeavors			0
but history is kindest to those who speak simply			1
as @entity164 reportedly advised her eloquent but often long - winded husband , @entity165 , in order to be immortal , a speech should not be interminable			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity169 .			2

@entity169 : the @entity3 was only 278 words , @entity9 's best talks were brief
@entity15 did *n't* dumb down speech , he says . a few words can relay complex ideas
" ask not what your country can do for you , ask what you can do for your country " just 78 words
@entity186 : many short phrases *kicked* off change : those who speak simply are remembered
