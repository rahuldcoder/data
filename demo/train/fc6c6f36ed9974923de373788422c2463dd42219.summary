-- the warnings seem almost ubiquitous today in this world of @entity3 and instant communication , but the word " tornado " actually used to be banned in weather forecasts			1
before the 1950s , there were no warnings that a tornado was about to occur			2
" that 's when the warning system we have now was just being developed , " said @entity11 of the @entity12			0
" @entity16 never got a tornado warning , " he said			2
but what about radar ? " there was no radar , " he said			2
before that , @entity16 had to endure decades of agonizing blows from @entity24 , many of the victims taken unaware			0
in 1882 , 17 years after the @entity28 ended , @entity27 sgt. @entity26 was asked to investigate tornadoes and how they developed			2
as @entity26 was doing his research , tornado forecasting came to a screeching halt when the @entity27 banned the word " tornado " from official forecasts because they were concerned the word would cause widespread panic			1
" they literally avoided the word up until the 1950s or so , " @entity11 said			0
" they were a little concerned about the panic or the tools were n't strong enough to predict them , " he said , " and quite frankly without radar , you could n't forecast them			1
" twisters were not measured in the same way they are now			0
thus , experts now do n't know whether the 1925 tri-state tornado -- which killed about 695 people when it tore through @entity52 , @entity53 and @entity54 -- was actually a single funnel or many , which is why it is n't officially considered the deadliest single tornado			1
tornadoes by the month : 1950 - 2011 so the emphasis went on observing and reporting rather than forecasting			1
the @entity58 started reporting tornadoes , thunderstorms , hailstorms , lightning and high winds at a few experimental locations across the @entity65 in spring 1943			1
gradually , forecasters started issuing forecasts for severe thunderstorms , but could not tell the time nor place			1
as for tornado forecasts ? still off - limits			2
a breakthrough happened in the late 1940s , when two @entity75 officers identified conditions that were favorable for tornado formation in the @entity78			0
the first tornado forecast was issued march 20 , 1948			1
six hours later , a twister slammed into @entity81 in @entity82			0
the tornado caused $ 6 million in damage , but no one was killed , thanks to a tornado safety plan that was implemented at the base after the forecast was issued			1
joplin tornado sets deadly record the tornado bulletin brought the @entity75 attention from the public and local media			0
however , tornado forecasts were only available to @entity75 weather offices and were still not issued by the @entity58			1
then came @entity98 and @entity99 , or radar			0
during @entity102 , radar was invented to detect enemy ships and aircraft			0
radar operators soon began to notice that rain would often obscure aircraft			0
this led to using radar to detect storms that could produce tornadoes			2
finally , in 1950 , the ban on the word " tornado " in weather forecasts was lifted			2
that was the same year official federal records about tornadoes -- in terms of their location , strength and damage inflicted -- were first kept			0
in 1953 , the @entity58 established the @entity123 , known as @entity123			2
the first tornado watches issued by @entity123 usually covered an average area of 27,000 square miles			0
today , tornado and severe thunderstorm watches average 25,000 square miles			2
in 1966 , @entity123 was renamed the @entity123			0
at this time , tornado and severe thunderstorm forecasts were renamed " watches " to correspond with products issued by the @entity132			1
in the early 1990s , @entity133 , or as it was more commonly known , @entity134 , was deployed at local @entity58 forecast offices nationwide			1
doppler radar allowed forecasters to see more than just precipitation			1
with the new radar , they could actually detect wind circulations within storms that could lead to tornado formation			2
doppler weather radar was part of a wider modernization of forecast offices nationwide lasting nearly a decade			1
" today forecasters use a comprehensive system ( to detect storms ) but radar is the foundation because radar detects the circulation of winds that form tornadoes , " @entity11 said			1
" @entity157 with that are people on the ground who are trained storm - spotters			0
you always need eyes on the storm , " he said			0
after the deployment of doppler weather radar , lead times for tornadoes were nearly doubled , from less than five minutes to around 10 to 13 minutes			1
in october 1995 , the @entity123 was renamed the @entity123 , and as part of the weather service 's modernization program , the @entity123 was moved to @entity173 , @entity82			0
today , the @entity123 issues forecasts for severe thunderstorms as far as eight days out and is tasked with issuing severe thunderstorm and tornado watches in the @entity65			1
tornado warnings are issued by local @entity58 forecast offices			1
even though forecasters can now identify conditions favorable for tornadoes , they still can not predict exactly when and where tornadoes will touch down			1
officials in @entity189 , @entity52 , confirmed at least 116 people dead after a twister smashed the city sunday			0
destructive tornadoes and severe storms tore through the @entity195 in late april , killing hundreds of people			2
with all the advancements in storm technology , the question is simple : why ? " that 's the question of 2011 , " @entity11 said			0
" why have so many people died in these tornadoes ? that 's the open question			0
it 's partly because of the strength of these tornadoes			0
also because they 've hit populated areas			0
" while tools such as @entity3 detect winds within severe storms that could indicate a tornado may be imminent , many of these rotating storms do not go on to produce tornadoes			1
although tornado forecasting has remarkably improved over the last two decades with advanced forecasting techniques , weather satellites , numerical forecast models and doppler weather radar , there is much about tornado forecasting that still remains a mystery			1

@entity65 @entity58 started reporting severe weather at a few @entity65 locations in 1943
forecasters were n't allowed to mention tornado *possibility* because of fears of panic
first tornado forecast in 1948 gave air force base time to implement safety plan
doppler radar *greatly* improved *meteorologists* ' ability to predict tornadoes
