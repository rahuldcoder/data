@entity0 -- if you can tolerate the junkies on the stairwells or the rats that sometimes scale the 12 floors of her building on the external electrical wiring , @entity3 's penthouse shack ticks all the boxes for a multi-million dollar property in @entity0			1
it 's light , it 's well ventilated and it has sweeping views of @entity19 's @entity18			1
constructed from recycled materials , the design is customized to her lifestyle down to the last detail			0
" this is my washing machine , " says @entity3 , pointing proudly to a small stainless steel basin on the terrace side of her rooftop house in @entity29			1
" i do my tai chi exercises here in the morning , and on moonlit nights i like to sit out here and look out on the mountain			0
" anywhere else in @entity0 , luxury apartments can often fetch hk $ 100 million ( us $ 12.85 million ) , and a house with these features could easily cost the average transaction price of hk $ 13.25 million ( us $ 1.7 million ) , according to data released by agency @entity40 earlier this year			1
the only difference is that as an unprepossessing corrugated iron shack that forms part of @entity0 's extensive network of sky slums -- technically illegal rooftop structures barnacled onto the roofs of tenements built in the 1950s and 60s -- the market is sluggish			1
nevertheless , a gray market in these slum dwellings does exist			0
" of course the agent never explicitly says it 's a rooftop dwelling			2
the listing will say something like small apartment with a unique view or interesting features , " says dr. @entity55 of @entity56 who has studied informal housing			2
" i 've heard anecdotal evidence of them changing hands for hk $ 40,000 ( us $ 5,000 ) but that was three years ago when i was doing my research			2
" in the volatile world of @entity0 property prices , says realtor @entity72 of @entity73 , they could now be worth a lot more			1
" even if a dwelling has an illegal structure status , i would say that it was absolutely impossible to get anything in @entity0 for under $ hk1 million ( us $ 129,000 ) , " @entity75 says			1
@entity80 's most expensive luxury city is ... she contends prices could even exceed this , making @entity3 's hand - built shanty one of the most expensive slum dwellings in the world			1
according to the latest @entity0 census from 2006 , there are 3,962 rooftop dwellers in 1,556 households in @entity0			2
mostly found in old urban areas in @entity19 -- @entity29 , @entity93 and @entity94 -- the houses are crammed together so tightly that they form their own above - ground streetscapes , complete with gardens , playgrounds and places of worship			1
the slums are a hangover from the housing crises of the 1950s and 1960s when successive waves of refugees from mainland @entity106 set up squatter cities in @entity0			1
many of the residents have lived in the slums for more than 30 years , and new arrivals tend to be underprivileged migrants from either mainland @entity106 , @entity113 , @entity114 or other parts of @entity116			1
since 2001 , when 16,359 people lived on @entity0 's rooftops , the number of illegal dwellings has reduced dramatically			1
while government policy has played a part , more often the tenements -- under constant pressure due to the shortage of land in @entity0 -- are torn down to make way for new shopping and residential developments			1
for the government , which supplies these rooftop communities with a postal service , water and electricity ; collects rates ; and even levies stamp duty on their sale and purchase , the sky slums operate under an established practice of " tolerance versus demolition , " says @entity55			1
their existence , while not ideal , keeps almost 4,000 people off a crowded public housing queue , he adds			2
fire restrictions are strict ( those with a single rather than double fire exits are earmarked for demolition as a top priority ) , and building codes rigidly enforced ( adding an extra floor to a non-structural building is forbidden ) , but the @entity155 's normal practice is simply to issue a notice that slates the illegal structure for eventual demolition			0
under this system , illegal rooftop dwellings often survive for decades and are bought and sold with the demolition notice as part of the negotiated price of the transaction			0
despite their quasi-legal status , @entity55 explains , authorities will act promptly , if they receive complaints from third parties , making the residents vulnerable to abuse			0
" there have been reports of some owners , living on the floor immediately below the rooftop huts , making complaints to the building authority to get their rooftop neighbors evicted , " he says			0
" in other cases , the landlord renting these huts may make complaints to evade their responsibilities as stipulated in the landlord - tenant contract			0
" as for @entity3 , she says she has owned her house for decades			0
the double fire exit on the roof has made her structure safe from demolition , and she has no plans to move from @entity29			2
" if they moved me to public housing it would shorten my life , " she says , pointing to the nearby tower blocks			0
" those flats are too small			0
" while there are disadvantages -- she says the house rocks in typhoons , the dark stairwell attracts drug users , and the rats are too clever to be trapped -- she says there 's nowhere else she 'd rather live			2
" my neighbors are great , the police are quick to come if we have any trouble with drugs , there 's no crime , the shops are downstairs and everything is just so convenient , " she says			0
" people may look down on me , but i certainly do n't look down on myself			0
