-- @entity5 was one of the glories of the ancient world , its walls and mythic hanging gardens listed among the @entity4			2
founded about 4,000 years ago , the ancient city was the capital of 10 dynasties in @entity12 , considered one of the earliest cradles of civilization and the birthplace of writing and literature			0
but following years of plunder , neglect and conflict , the @entity5 of today scarcely conjures that illustrious history			2
in recent years , the @entity24 authorities have reopened @entity5 to tourists , hoping that one day the site will draw visitors from all over the globe			1
but despite the site 's remarkable archaeological value and impressive views , it is drawing only a smattering of tourists , drawn by a curious mix of ancient and more recent history			1
the city -- just 85km ( 52 miles ) south of @entity37 , about a two hour drive , dependent on checkpoints -- still bears the marks of ham - fisted attempts at restoration by former @entity24 dictator @entity43 , and a subsequent occupation by @entity46 forces in 2003			1
they would n't let anyone in , " says @entity49 , a guard at the historical sites at @entity5 , recalling the day @entity46 tanks rolled into view , before forces set up camp			0

the original now stands as part of a reconstruction of the gate in @entity77 's @entity76 , whereas in @entity5 itself , visitors enter through a replica			2
yet remnants of @entity5 's former glory remain , with sections of the city 's walls still intact			1
later excavations and conservation work carried out under @entity43 's rule greatly despoiled the site , say archaeologists			1
@entity24 archaeologist @entity91 said that during a massive reconstruction project in the early 1980s , @entity43 began building a replica of the palace of @entity69 on top of the ruins of the ancient palace			1
like @entity69 , he wrote his name on many of the bricks , with inscriptions such as : " this was built by @entity43 , son of @entity69 , to glorify @entity24			1
" after the @entity103 , @entity43 began building a modern palace for himself on top of ruins in the style of a @entity108 ziggurat			0
when @entity46 forces arrived in 2003 , they occupied the palace , which lies adjacent to @entity69 's palace and overlooks the @entity113 , and left their own mark			0
today , a basketball hoop remains in @entity5 , while concertina wire left behind by the military is used to prevent visitors from climbing over a 2,500 - year - old lion statue -- an ancient symbol of the city			0

tour guide @entity128 says an oil pipeline runs through the eastern part of the ancient city			0
" it goes through the outer wall of @entity5 , " he says			0
yet despite the shortcomings in its preservation , @entity5 holds a draw for small numbers of @entity24 visitors -- even if only to enter @entity43 's marble - lined palaces , still a novelty 10 years after the dictator 's downfall			1
@entity146 , visiting with her family for the first time from @entity145 , told @entity0 : " we were just looking for a change of atmosphere , to have the kids see something different			0
" @entity5 is certainly that .			0

the city still bears the marks of poor attempts at restoration by @entity43
