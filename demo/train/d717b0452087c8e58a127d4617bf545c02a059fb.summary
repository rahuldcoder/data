@entity0 -- the @entity5 administration will ask @entity6 for another $ 83.4 billion to fund the wars in @entity8 and @entity9 through the end of september , @entity3 congressional sources said thursday			1
president @entity5 's spending measure is likely to be the last supplemental request submitted to pay for the wars			0
the request is expected to pay for those conflicts for the rest of the 2009 budget year , two @entity3 congressional sources said			0
the money would bring the running tab for both conflicts to about $ 947 billion , according to figures from the @entity22			1
more than three - quarters of the $ 864 billion appropriated so far has gone to the war in @entity8 , the agency estimated			2
since taking office in january , president @entity5 has announced plans to shift troops out of @entity8 and beef up @entity30 forces in @entity9 , where @entity30 troops have been battling @entity32 and @entity34 fighters since @entity32 's 2001 attacks			1
in a letter to house speaker @entity37 , @entity5 said the situation in @entity9 and neighboring @entity40 " demands urgent attention			2
" " the @entity34 is resurgent , and @entity32 threatens @entity30 from its safe haven along the @entity9 - @entity40 border , " @entity5 wrote in submitting the funding request			1
" there is no question of the resolve of our military women and men			0
yet , in @entity9 , that resolve has not been matched by a comprehensive strategy and sufficient resources , " @entity5 wrote			0
about $ 75 billion of the latest request would pay for military operations , including $ 9.8 billion for body armor and protective vehicles and $ 11.6 billion to replace worn - out equipment			1
the rest would go to diplomatic programs and development aid -- including $ 1.6 billion for @entity9 , $ 1.4 billion for @entity40 and $ 700 million for @entity8			1
the request would also provide about $ 800 million for the @entity62 , including humanitarian aid for @entity64 , the @entity65 - ruled territory that was heavily bombarded by @entity66 in december and january ; $ 800 million to support @entity68 peacekeeping missions in @entity69 ; and $ 30 million to the @entity70 to manage the closure of the @entity30 prison camp at @entity73 , @entity74			2
the supplemental spending bill is likely to be the last such request submitted to @entity6 to pay for the wars , @entity76 spokesman @entity75 said			0
while the @entity81 administration relied on supplemental spending bills to fund the conflicts , @entity5 began including war spending in his 2010 budget			0
the president urged @entity6 to move quickly on the request " and not to use the supplemental to pursue unnecessary spending			0
" but rep. @entity90 , a prominent anti-war @entity91 , said the requested funding would " prolong our occupation of @entity8 through at least the end of 2011 , " when @entity30 troops are scheduled to leave the country , " and it will deepen and expand our military presence in @entity9 indefinitely			1
" " instead of attempting to find military solutions to the problems we face in @entity8 and @entity9 , president @entity5 must fundamentally change the mission in both countries to focus on promoting reconciliation , economic development , humanitarian aid , and regional diplomatic efforts			1
" last month , @entity5 announced the @entity30 plans to withdraw most of its troops from @entity8 by the end of august 2010			2
