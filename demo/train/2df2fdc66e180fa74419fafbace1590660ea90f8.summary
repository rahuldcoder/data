-- a second day of a strike against @entity3 's flagship carrier , @entity2 , ended wednesday with police charging protesters and angry passengers at @entity7 in @entity8 , said @entity9 , an official with @entity3 's @entity10			1
@entity9 said a number of people were beaten as police attempted to clear the terminal and restore order			2
the strike was called on tuesday after month - long negotiations between the airline and unions representing the airline 's pilots and staff ended in failure			1
@entity2 grounded close to 60 international and domestic flights leaving thousands of frustrated passengers at @entity7 and @entity25 in @entity26			2
the @entity26 airport was closed to passengers and @entity2 staff with police guarding all entrances and exits			1
@entity2 staff called the strike demanding management reinstate five pilots who were fired , that managing director @entity36 resign , and that a proposed code share agreement with @entity38 be dropped			1
speaking to @entity0 , @entity39 , president of the @entity40 and head of a joint action committee representing all airline employees , said " the proposed code share agreement , which still needs to be approved by the government and regulators , would make @entity2 into a regional airline as opposed to international and get rid of lucrative international routes			1
" furthermore , the code share agreement would cut down the number of staff because flights would use @entity54 or @entity55 as their hub and use @entity38 staff to fly passengers to international destinations currently offered by @entity2 , he said			1
@entity60 was appointed managing director of @entity2 two years ago			0
since then , he has been criticized over alleged corruption scandals and for the airline incurring heavy debt			0
according to @entity39 , " this is another example of @entity60 's corruption , we have the crew and capabilities and we have been flying for the last 50 years			0
i do n't know what is the reason behind the code share			1
" the joint action committee from the union flew to @entity26 wednesday for discussions with federal minister @entity76 , who oversees the airline			0
however , no agreement was reached			0
@entity76 agreed to two of the union 's demands but declined to consider removing @entity60 as managing director of @entity2 , the union said			0
strikers have vowed to continue striking until they reach a conclusion and the managing director is removed			0
" we have declared today that until they kick out @entity60 the strike will continue , " said @entity39			0
airline spokesman @entity90 refused to comment on the situation .			2
