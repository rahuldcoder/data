-- what was it @entity3 used to say ? " no pain , no gain			2
" she was n't talking about punching a guy in the face , handcuffing him to a chair for days and weeks on end , stringing him upside down like a piece of dry - cleaning , setting him on fire ( feel the burn ! ) and running him over with a van , but these nuances can get lost in translation when an ambitious young man takes it into his head to improve his lot in life			2
such is the plot of " @entity23			1
" @entity24 ( @entity25 ) is like @entity26 : he believes in @entity27			1
his heroes are the self - made men -- like the @entity29 , like @entity30			2
the guys who started with nothing and made it happen for themselves			0
do - ers , not do n't - ers			0
@entity24 believes in @entity27 and he believes in fitness , and having proved his worth by attaining the physique he always wanted and tripling the membership at the @entity40 gym where he works ( primarily by offering free memberships to strippers ) he reckons he deserves the rest of the package : the big house , the boat , the sports car , the money			0
and so he hatches a " three - finger plan			0
" with two bodybuilding buddies ( @entity51 and @entity52 ) , he snatches a wealthy client ( @entity53 ) and tortures him until he signs away all his property and assets			1
the gang 's gross incompetence and double - digit iq is matched only by the indifference of local law enforcement			1
although he 's famous for his boys ' toys movies ( " transformers , " " @entity66 " ) , let 's not forget @entity69 cut his teeth on the slick buddy cop movie " @entity76 , " which filmed in and around @entity40 at much the same time as @entity24 and pals were chopping up body parts with a chainsaw and an ax			1
does that make this self - styled " small movie " a more personal , mature work than his blockbusters ? well , it 's r - rated , which means @entity69 gets to indulge his sexism and casual homophobia more explicitly than usual , albeit roped to a scattershot satire of dumbbell self - improvement culture and rampant egomania			1
writers @entity89 and @entity89 have shown a knack for hardboiled black comedy before , notably in " @entity93 , " and it 's easy to imagine that the @entity95 could have fashioned something sharp and funny out of this dismal true story			1
but even if he 's obviously imitating " @entity100 " ( the @entity102 ' worst film ) and " @entity103 " ( possibly their best ) , putting a satire in @entity69 's hands is rather like presenting the keys of a stolen @entity105 to a drunken teenager			1
it 's a fast ride , but it does n't take you where you want to go			1
this is a movie about stupidity and cruelty in which stupidity and cruelty permeate almost every scene			0
@entity69 does n't hold anything back -- everything is over-pitched and underlined in hot neon			1
if he 's braked his trademark action cutting , it 's only to go overboard on slow - motion so as not to miss a single drop of blood or perspiration			2
he casts broad comic actors like @entity125 , @entity126 , @entity127 and @entity128 in supporting roles while encouraging his leads to play it straight , but caricatures victims and criminals alike			0
they 're all contemptible in his eyes -- the women more than anyone			0
@entity139 model @entity138 plays an eastern @entity141 stripper who is apparently so stupid she believes @entity24 is a @entity142 agent			0
she 's also subjected to a throwaway gang rape gag for her trouble -- thanks for that , @entity147			2
the scenes of violence -- played for gross - out black comedy -- are especially toxic			0
this crude and ugly entertainment is as crass as everything this depressingly successful filmmaker has done .			0

" @entity23 , " directed by @entity69 , is based on a true crime story
the film stars @entity25 , @entity51 and @entity52
the *director* 's callous disregard for human suffering is plain to see
