@entity1 , @entity0 -- the negotiations are over			2
the treaty has been signed			0
the skies across the @entity6 are now open for free movement of flights between @entity10 and @entity11 cities			2
now the battle commences between airlines as they prepare for their new - found commercial freedom when the @entity16 agreement comes into action in march 2008			1
the choice of transatlantic routes is set to increases with the advent of the @entity16 agreement			1
the main beneficiaries of increased competition between airlines are likely to be business travelers			0
and while they may not see a dramatic reduction in ticket prices , they can look forward to a greater choice of flights from a greater number of airlines as well as an increase in business - only services			1
airlines with the strongest brands and best quality products are likely to lure passengers away from @entity10 rivals by launching flights from other major @entity10 cities			2
@entity43 has confirmed it will launch its first transatlantic flights from continental @entity10 cities once the agreement comes into place next year			1
and while it is not ready to confirm branding , types of aircraft , or even final routes , a @entity43 spokesperson said likely contenders for new transatlantic routes will be from business destinations such as @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 and @entity60			1
she also confirmed that , contrary to expectations , these flights would not be exclusively business class			2
though they will offer premium cabins for business customers			0
@entity67 is expecting to place a greater focus on its business customers and has established a team to work towards the launch of business - only flights in 2009			1
these will fly from airports such as @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity60 and @entity76 and the airline is currently in discussion with @entity79 and @entity80 to place orders for between 10 and 15 aircraft			0
@entity67 and @entity43 are both confident they can entice customers away from @entity10 national carriers due to the strength of their brands and service offering			1
as @entity92 , director of corporate communications at @entity67 says , " we are seen as a truly global brand and well - placed to compete with the quality of business services currently coming out of cities such as @entity57 and @entity60			1
" open skies will put an end to the exclusive arrangement granted to @entity43 , @entity67 , @entity97 and @entity98 to fly transatlantic out of @entity99			1
as a result , airlines including @entity101 , @entity102 and @entity103 are all lined up to launch direct transatlantic flights from @entity99 from next year			2
but with the airport currently operating at almost - maximum capacity , it is likely that new flights will be limited			2
airlines operating from other airports , in particular the new business - only players such as @entity112 , @entity113 and @entity114 , will , however , see an opportunity to expand their own services across the @entity6			1
@entity119 , executive vice president for planning and development at @entity11 business - class airline , @entity122 , says it expects to " strengthen its position at @entity125 " as a result of the @entity16 agreement			1
" with more flights moving from @entity130 to @entity99 , three major airports will become two in @entity1			1
" as such , he adds , @entity125 could become the default airport for travelers coming from and to the east of the city			0
now that the @entity11 @entity137 has given approval for @entity122 to launch flights from @entity125 to other countries with open skies agreements with the @entity11 , business travelers in @entity1 should also be able to pick up @entity122 flights to destinations such as @entity144			1
@entity122 has confirmed that it will not fight for slots at @entity99 , which @entity119 says has become an " operational nightmare			0
" yet , other premium - only services are not ruling out the move			2
@entity113 , currently operating out of @entity150 , has been in discussion with ( un-named ) airlines interested in striking deals to launch flights out of @entity99			2
opportunities have been offered for flights to @entity11 cities such as @entity158 , says @entity159 , @entity113 's chief executive			0
" this is an ongoing dialogue , " he says			0
but before they make the move , they would need to see major changes to facilities at @entity99 in order for it to offer the " personalized , discreet and carefree " travel experience @entity113 offers customers from @entity150			0
" @entity99 has become a zoo and the customer experience has become appalling , " he says			0
airline executives agree that growth in transatlantic flights as a result of the @entity16 agreement will be aimed at business customers			1
as @entity159 says , airlines have little else to offer , or gain , in terms of economy long - haul seats			0
and as @entity92 at @entity67 points out , given the success of the new business - only entrants and the simultaneous ongoing demand for its business class seats , " there 's clearly a market out there for business - only flights			1
" while there may be some softening of prices from @entity99 as airlines fight for slots , few expect prices for business travelers to drop dramatically as a result of the @entity16 agreement			1
as @entity43 's spokesperson says , @entity199 to @entity200 is already a very competitive market			0
" it is not as if we are moving from a monopoly , " she says			0
despite this , there is still a great deal to offer business customers and those that will make the most of the opportunity , says @entity214 , spokesperson from @entity215 , will be the most innovative			0
" we have created a new playing field and it is up to players to make the most of that and for governments to take the agreement forward towards further liberalization			0
