a @entity6 court ruled tuesday that it would accept an offer from @entity8 to bring an early end to proceedings , which had already lasted three months			1
presiding judge @entity11 gave the 83 - year - old @entity13 businessman a week to make payments of $ 99 million to the @entity16 state treasury and $ 1 million to a local charity which looks after terminally ill children			1
@entity8 , who has always denied any wrongdoing , was accused of bribing a @entity6 banker eight years go over the sale of a controlling interest in the company that runs the elite division of motorsport			1
under @entity6 law there is a provision to halt criminal proceedings to avoid long and costly court cases where a conviction might be difficult to achieve and after a negotiation between prosecutors and the defense			0
" while charges could have been pursued against the accused , the court took into consideration the age of the accused , his health and the considerable burden of attending court in a foreign country with all the language difficulties that entails and the public attention , " @entity11 said in his summing up			0
@entity8 , whose fortune is valued by @entity47 at over $ 4 billion , was asked by @entity11 if he could make the payment			0

" it brought down the curtain on proceedings in @entity56 that could have ended in a jail sentence of up to 10 years and the loss of his position at the helm of @entity2			1
outside the court , @entity51 told reporters : " this is not about a conviction , but a cessation of the trial with no admission of guilt			0
" there will be no guilty verdict whatsoever and that clearly changes the situation in terms of the evidence and legal position , otherwise the talks between the prosecution and defense would not have been possible			0
" the controversy dates back to 2006 , when the @entity6 regional bank @entity79 sold its 47.2 % stake in @entity2 to the current majority shareholder , @entity82 -- a private equity firm			2
the prosecution claimed @entity8 paid @entity84 , formerly the chief risk officer of @entity79 , a sweetener of $ 44 million to steer the sale to @entity82 , so he could remain in charge of @entity2			1
@entity8 admitted the payment to @entity89 , but only after the banker threatened to make damaging claims about his tax status to @entity13 's @entity93			0
the case revealed that he had avoided a Â £ 1.2 billion ( $ 2 billion ) bill through a legal tax avoidance scheme , and had settled with @entity13 tax authorities by paying Â £ 10 million			0
