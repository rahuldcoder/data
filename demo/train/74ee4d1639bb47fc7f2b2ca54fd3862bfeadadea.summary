@entity0 -- for years , @entity2 and her three daughters thought they had certainty about their loved one 's death on september 11 , 2001			1
they believed @entity9 -- @entity2 's husband and father to @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14 -- died instantly when the second hijacked plane , @entity15 , hit the @entity16 of the @entity17			1
@entity9 worked for @entity18 on the 84th floor , very close to the plane 's point of impact			1
the family took some comfort believing that he might not have suffered			0
but a handwritten note with just five words and two numbers on it has changed everything for the @entity9 family			1
the note reads , " 84th floor west office 12 people trapped			2
" the note was written by @entity9			1
" we all just wrote the same ending , " @entity2 told @entity37 affiliate @entity36 , " and it was n't correct			0
" remembering 9/11 the note reveals that @entity9 was not only alive after impact but actively trying to get help			1
he somehow sent the note out an opening in the @entity16 and down to the street below			2
@entity9 's best friend , @entity47 , believes he knows what happened			1
" he actually literally broke a window , probably with a desk , " @entity47 said			0
" that 's how they found that it was his note ; his bloody thumbprint was on the corner of the letter			2
" according to @entity47 and accounts the family gave to @entity36 and the @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity59 newspaper , the note was recovered on the street almost immediately			2
then , according to those accounts , it was handed to a guard at the nearby @entity67			0
the @entity16 collapsed shortly after that			0
the @entity67 kept the note stored for years and then turned it over to the @entity70 september 11th @entity71 , according to those accounts			1
the museum worked with the @entity75 @entity74 to process the note			1
it was that smudge of blood on the note -- @entity9 's blood -- that enabled the medical examiner to use dna technology to trace the note			1
by the time the note had gone through all those processes , a decade had passed			2
in august 2011 , the medical examiner 's office called @entity2 , said it had something written and asked her to identify it			2
she brought @entity47 with her			0
" when we saw the letter , you ca n't mistake his handwriting , " @entity47 said			0
" so we knew right away that ... he went down fighting as hard as he could			0
" " it was hard to hold back your tears , " said @entity47 , who like the @entity9 family lives in @entity60			1
" it 's another part of him that just comes back			0
" after 9/11 , how we honored our son 's memory @entity47 and @entity2 decided it was best not to tell @entity2 's daughters right away			0
" i think we both realized that it 's a really tough awakening , to realize that your father did n't die instantly , and might have really suffered or might have had a harder time than we thought , " @entity47 said			1
only " fragments " of @entity9 's body were recovered , according to @entity47			1
@entity2 waited until this year , when the youngest daughter , @entity14 , was out of college , to talk about the note			2
" my youngest , when i told them about the note , said , ' oh , @entity115 must have been so scared , " @entity2 said			2
" and i said ' no , your father was hopeful			0
' " @entity47 said he believes the physical characteristics of the writing tell @entity9 's story in those final moments			1
" he was n't trembling			0
it just looked like , ' this is what i got ta do			0
i got ta get some help to these 12 people			0
' " teaching my child about the 9/11 attacks			0
