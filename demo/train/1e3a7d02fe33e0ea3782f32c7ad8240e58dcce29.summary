-- as @entity1 's opens its first restaurant in @entity4 , take a look at some of the big breakthroughs the fast food chain has made in the past -- from its first outlet in the @entity11 , through the @entity12 and @entity13 , to the branch at @entity15			1
@entity16 it took @entity1 's 14 years of intense negotiations to convince the @entity20 leaders of the @entity11 to allow the chain to set up their first restaurant			1
yet almost as soon as the @entity23 began to fall , the first @entity1 's opened in @entity25 's busy @entity24 -- on january 31 , 1990			1
the restaurant seated 700 diners and its opening attracted thousands of people , who queued for hours to spend the equivalent of weeks ' salaries on a single burger			0
the company says the @entity25 branch is still the largest @entity36 's in the world			1
@entity38 @entity36 's operates around 180 branches in @entity38 , of which over 50 are kosher , meaning they only serve food that meets strict dietary requirements			1
unlike the non-kosher restaurants , these branches stay closed on saturdays to observe the @entity44 and boast a unique logo with the golden arches sitting on a blue , rather than red background			0
@entity1 's restaurants around the world cater to local demands by including their own versions of regional specialties on the menu : in @entity38 , that 's the " @entity55			1
" @entity56 base the @entity36 's within the compound at @entity59 is the only branch of the fast food chain on the island of @entity62			2
the restaurant is only accessible to the base 's personnel and the chain says it has no plans to open any other branches in @entity62			2
@entity69 @entity1 's spent more than four years trying to break into the @entity69 market , but opposition from local shop owners , supported by the government , was fierce			1
the chain finally opened its first branch in the country in 2011			0
@entity1 's @entity77 @entity1 's has managed to succeed in many @entity79 countries , offering various culturally - and religiously appropriate specialties to its @entity82 customers			1
the company 's first venture into the @entity86 world was @entity87 , where it opened its first branch in @entity89 in 1992			0
most branches respect @entity91 , restricting service in fasting periods during the holy month , and offering special menus at night			0
certified halal - quality food is widely available , and the restaurant tries to reflect the local tastes by offering the @entity98 , served in folded @entity100 bread			0
in @entity77 , the chain adheres to local laws by segregating male and female diners -- much to the disapproval of international women 's rights organizations			0
@entity106 the global hamburger chain is a big success in @entity106 , where it operates 300 branches			0
@entity36 's offers special meals to please the palates of local customers ; it does not serve any beef or pork - based burgers , reflecting the religious beliefs of many @entity106			2
instead , it offers the @entity13 and the @entity119 -- a vegetarian - friendly blend of spicy potatoes and peas			0
@entity123 ok , it 's not really the real deal , but @entity1 's could still claim it as a win -- of sorts ... as on other @entity130 military bases around the world , @entity1 's food used to be available within @entity133 's @entity132			1
and while the chain is not planning to expand into the country , a successful knock - off fast food restaurant " @entity138 's " in the town of @entity140 has been popular with locals since it opened there in the 1990s			2
