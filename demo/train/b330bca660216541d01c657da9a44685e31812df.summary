the @entity0 is now using drones and manned surveillance aircraft over @entity3 in the search for the hundreds of schoolgirls kidnapped by @entity6			1
but signs of them are yet to emerge , and the task is complicated by the possibility that the girls have been separated into groups			0
the @entity0 , which is supporting the @entity3 government 's efforts , will continue to deepen its efforts , defense secretary @entity13 said wednesday while traveling to @entity17			1
however , " i have seen no intelligence come back that i am aware of that shows that we 've located those girls , " he said			0
the assets provide some of the best tools to try to find the girls , but the @entity3 government has shown some reluctance to use @entity0 help			1
for now , the @entity0 is not sharing raw intelligence from its surveillance aircraft with @entity3 's armed forces because the countries have still not established the intelligence - sharing protocols and safeguards needed for an intelligence - sharing agreement , @entity29 spokesman col. @entity28 said			1
that said , the intelligence gathered through the surveillance flights is being fed to an interdisciplinary team on the ground , and that team is analyzing it and providing advice to the @entity3 government , he said			1
@entity28 added that the manned and unmanned aircraft being used are unarmed			1
@entity0 secretary of state @entity46 called the kidnapping of hundreds of girls an " unconscionable crime , " vowing to do " everything possible to support the @entity3 government to return these young women to their homes and to hold the perpetrators to justice			1
" i will tell you , my friends , i have seen this scourge of terror across the planet , and so have you			0
they do n't offer anything except violence , " he said in a statement			0
" they just tell people , ' you have to behave the way we tell you to , ' and they will punish you if you do n't			0
" pressure to find the girls wednesday marked one month since the 276 girls were abducted from @entity71 by @entity6			0
a worldwide campaign to " bring back our girls " has spread awareness of the incident , and as the days go by , the pressure to find them increases			0
at least four @entity3 soldiers died in an ambush wednesday as they were returning from patrol duties in @entity71 , the @entity3 military said			1
@entity0 sen. @entity83 , @entity84 , is among those who support @entity0 military intervention to find the girls , if needed			2
" you know , it 's interesting to me that when a ship is hijacked and taken into custody by these pirates , we have ... no reservations about going in and trying to take that ship back and the crew that 's being held , " he said			0
" we have no compunctions about that			0
" when it comes to the hundreds of girls who were kidnapped , the response has dragged , he said			0
a @entity0 military operation " could be done in a way that is very efficient , but for us not to do that , in my opinion , would be an abrogation of our responsibilities , " @entity83 said			2
two senior administration officials told @entity109 that it is premature to talk about a special operations incursion into @entity3 because the girls have not been found yet			2
the @entity0 military is there to advise and assist , but not to actively participate , the sources said			2
if the girls are found , it would be up to the @entity3 to devise a plan and execute it with @entity0 assistance , the sources said			1
and that raises other complications			0
the @entity3 military is capable of carrying out a rescue operation , but there are concerns because it has been heavy - handed in the past and killed many civilians , the sources said			1
as it currently stands , @entity0 law prohibits the @entity0 military from working with @entity3 military units that have been accused of abuses , a senior @entity130 official said			1
" we 've been very clear about our concerns about the @entity3 reports of and evidence of abuses by the @entity3 military , " the official said			1
even with all of these complications , the @entity0 is committed to doing everything it can to find the girls , the official said			2
separately , @entity3 president @entity142 is not considering swapping @entity6 prisoners for the kidnapped girls , according to media reports , which cited @entity146 , @entity148 's @entity147 minister , who met with the president			2
the director of @entity3 's @entity151 , a government information ministry , had previously said negotiations could be an option .			0
