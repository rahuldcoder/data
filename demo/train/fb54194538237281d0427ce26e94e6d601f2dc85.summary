-- " my last boss was a woman			1
all she did was micromanage everyone			0
" " every woman boss i 've ever had was extremely passive - aggressive in their leadership			1
" " it ( was ) much easier being managed by a male because he did n't put up with the pettiness or the gossip			2
" sorry , ladies of the working world			0
those are comments we received in response to my recent piece about how companies with more women in c - suites and corporate boards do better financially			0
but so many commenters said they absolutely preferred working for a man , we knew we had to explore the " why " behind that sentiment			1
then this week , the @entity29 organization added some numbers -- and fuel -- to the debate			1
' i 'm not surprised ' in telephone interviews with a random sample of 2,059 adults , @entity29 found that @entity37 still prefer a male boss over a female , with 35 % choosing to work for a man and 23 % saying they prefer women supervisors			1
it 's the highest - ever number recorded for women bosses since @entity29 has been asking			1
when you compare these results to the 1953 responses -- that 's when @entity29 first asked this question -- the gap has narrowed significantly			1
in 1953 , 66 % chose a male boss and 5 % picked a female one , a huge gap that has been reduced to a 12 - point difference today			1
" i think it 's great to see that trend , so i 'm very encouraged by it , but i 'm not surprised that it 's still a 2 - to - 1 ratio of people preferring to work for men than women , " said sociologist and workplace consultant @entity55 , who has written several books , including a best - seller on diversity called " a @entity60 in the @entity61			1
" topping the list of reasons , according to @entity55 , is the fact that men still have more power in the workplace than women			1
" if you had your druthers , you 'd rather work for somebody who has some influence , some power , some clout , some status and that 's true for men and women , " @entity55 said			1
" it trickles down so that if you work for a powerful boss , you 're a little bit more powerful			1
your whole department is seen in a more positive light if the boss is a powerful ( and ) influential person , " she said			0
' how to tell a @entity92 ' in conversations with @entity55 and other experts , it 's clear another factor is at work -- the real stereotypes that exist about working for a woman			1
" it 's an old stereotype that women may not be good bosses so when that happens , it sticks , " said @entity100 , vice president of global marketing and corporate communications for @entity103 , a nonprofit focused on expanding opportunities for women in business			1
" because the stereotype is in the water , and there are fewer women leaders than men , you may remember the woman who treated you badly and say , ' oh yeah , i remember her			1
' and it reinforces the stereotype			0
" perception is not reality , and stereotypes are perceptions			0
" @entity55 has created a list titled " how to tell a @entity124 " with examples of perceived gender differences -- " a male boss is assertive ; a female bossy is bossy " and " a male boss is attentive to details ; a female boss is picky			1
" opinion : are female leaders too cheerful for their own good ? " there is a double standard , " said @entity55 , who also wrote " @entity134 i learned from other women			1
" " the same exact behavior in a male boss is seen as a plus , and the same behavior in a female boss gets seen as a negative			1
" for instance , @entity55 said if a male boss " gets agitated and slams his fist down on the table and goes , ' i want this done by 3 o'clock this afternoon , ' everyone goes , ' ooh , take charge kind of guy			1
' " if a woman does the same thing , @entity55 said , people are likely to say , " oh , what a bitch			0
" " so the same tone of voice , the same words , the same body language , the same everything gets filtered through our stereotypes and assumptions about how various groups should behave , " she said			0
the ' token woman ' issue fueling the stereotypes , @entity55 and leaders from @entity103 said , are environments with few women in leadership positions			1
" when there 's going to be a token woman , one woman is going to make it to the top , what does this do ? " said @entity171 , president and ceo of @entity103 , during an interview last month			1
" does that encourage anybody to support women ? does it encourage women to support other women ? it 's a culture that will encourage women to fight with other women or to discourage other women			2
" but when the culture of the organization focuses on mentorship and sponsorship , and there are more women in leadership positions , that " @entity200 myth " of women not helping women gets busted , @entity191 said			0
in fact , a report by @entity103 found that 73 % of women who received career development support are helping to support and develop other women , versus 30 % of men			1
" our research shows that women not only sponsor and support other women , but that they do other men as well , and they really do pay it forward to a huge amount , " @entity191 said			2
that 's been the experience of @entity218 , one of the women i profiled last month			2
@entity218 is senior executive vice president and general counsel of the legal services firm @entity222 , where eight of the company 's 15 executives are women			2
" it could be that some women tend to be more critical , but i have n't seen that , " @entity218 said			0
" i 've seen more of the efforts for women to be supportive of other women			0
" the mom of two said , " it 's infectious			0
when women help other women , then the women they help ( have ) a role model in that regard			0
and then ... if ( they ) develop and grow into a position of power or authority , i expect they will be more likely to turn around and treat someone that way			0
" ' i 've had good experiences with both ' @entity218 , a former federal prosecutor , said she does n't have a preference -- she 's had good experiences with female and male bosses			2
" i 'm looking more for qualities that can be shared by men and women , " she said			2
" i 'm looking for someone who 's a good communicator , who 's going to be someone who is a good teacher , as well as be supportive , someone who is open to giving opportunities for growth and development and that can be provided by a man or a woman			2
" complaints we saw from readers that women micromanage , hold grudges and are unable to make decisions did n't reflect @entity269 's experience , she said			2
" maybe i 've just been blessed with very good bosses , supervisors , " she said			0
" it has not been my experience that women do those things			0
i think my experience maybe has been contrary to that			0
" when i asked an unscientific sampling in my @entity279 community about the new survey 's findings , i received a handful of responses , the majority with positive comments about working for women			1
" with one notable exception , all my great bosses have been women , " said @entity287 , a television news producer in @entity289			0
" the best ones are collaborative and intuitive , give you some room to accomplish things beyond your assignment or job description , and many have been good mentors as well			0
" on the other side is @entity301 , a college educator in @entity289 who also works with young special - education students			0
" men are more straightforward , less emotionally attached ( i mean this in a good way ) , " @entity301 said on @entity279			0
" women hold grudges and seek vengeance on their subordinates			0
that 's been my experience			0
" a father of two who did n't want to use his name said he reports to two women now who are " so much nicer " to work with than the male supervisors in his last job			1
but he added , " i think , overall , it just depends on the individual people			0
the most horrible boss i 've had in my career was a woman			2
the most amazing , mentoring and supportive boss i 've had was also a woman			2
i 've also had good and bad male bosses			0
so , like @entity218 from the @entity222 , i do n't have a preference			0
my current boss is a woman , so , of course , these days , i lean in that direction			2
do you prefer a male or female boss ? share your thoughts in the comments , or follow @entity334 on @entity335 , and like @entity336 on @entity279 .			1

after a @entity0 column on women and work , many commenters said they prefer working for men
new @entity29 survey finds more @entity37 still choose a male boss , but the gap is narrowing
in survey , 23 % said they prefer working for a woman , the highest number in study 's *history*
a double standard contributes to the gender gap , say experts on women in the workplace
