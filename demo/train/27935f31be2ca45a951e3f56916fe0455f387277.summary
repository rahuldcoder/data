-- it was not the sort of meme @entity4 wanted to generate			1
on monday , the comedian -- or whomever was in charge of his social media -- put out a challenge with a jovial picture of @entity4 in a cap : " go ahead			1
meme me ! # cosbymeme			2
" the @entity13 immediately reacted , but probably not in the way @entity4 expected			1
" @entity16 , have you seen my ... nevermind , found my raping hat ! " tweeted @entity18 over the cap picture			0
" my two favorite things ( -- ) @entity23 & rape , " tweeted @entity21 over a photo of @entity4 smiling			1
" look at this wacky shirt i 'm wearing ( -- ) also i am a serial rapist , " tweeted @entity25 over a picture of a thumbs - up @entity4 in a patterned shirt			1
by nightfall , @entity4 's original tweet had been pulled from the @entity32 , which led to this conclusion from @entity34 : " if anyone is looking for a job , the social media manager position for @ @entity37 is about to open up			1
" but if @entity4 's social media manager has gone underground , in the internet age -- where nothing ever goes away -- the rape allegations , which @entity4 has repeatedly denied , have stubbornly remained in the open			1
in late october , comedian @entity44 bluntly attacked what he perceived as @entity4 's " smuggest old black man public persona " by saying , " yeah , but you rape women , @entity4 , so turn the crazy down a couple notches			1
' i do n't curse onstage			0
' well , yeah , you 're ( a ) rapist , so i 'll take you saying lots of m * * * * * f * * * * * s on ' @entity4 : himself ' if you were n't a rapist			1
" a couple weeks later , @entity4 was booked on @entity60 's talk show , but the allegations reportedly gave the staff " cold feet , " according to @entity64			1
@entity4 's booking was " postponed at his request , " the website reported in an addendum			1
( @entity4 did do interviews with @entity71 and @entity72 without incident			1
) now comes the social media fiasco			0
for years , @entity4 has denied the rape allegations			1
in february , after @entity77 ran an interview with one of the purported victims , @entity76 , @entity4 's representative said , " this is a 10 - year - old , discredited accusation that proved to be nothing at the time , and is still nothing			1
" nine years ago , when @entity86 was interviewed by @entity87 on the " today " show , his lawyer issued a statement : " miss @entity76 's allegations are absolutely false			1
mr. @entity4 does not know the name @entity76 or ( maiden name ) @entity93 and the incident she describes did not happen			2
the fact that she may have repeated this story to others is not corroboration			0
" in the case of @entity99 , who sued @entity4 in 2005 over an incident the year before , @entity4 says the sex was consensual			2
@entity0 has reached out to @entity4 's representative for comment on this story , but has yet to hear back			1
@entity105 airs allegations at the time of @entity99 's lawsuit , @entity4 had been in the news for a sexual affair once before			1
in 1997 , a woman named @entity112 claimed to be @entity4 's love child			1
@entity4 admitted to a relationship with @entity112 's mother but denied paternity			1
@entity112 was later convicted of extortion			0
however , it was n't until @entity99 's lawsuit in 2005 that the comedian was accused of rape			1
@entity99 , a staffer for @entity123 's women 's basketball team , said in her suit that @entity4 -- a @entity123 alum -- had become a mentor to her in the months since they met in 2002			1
in early 2004 , he invited her to his house in suburban @entity128			0
@entity99 told @entity4 she was feeling stressed and @entity4 gave her three blue pills , which he described as " herbal medication , " according to her suit , which was posted on @entity131			2
then , her " knees began to shake , her limbs felt immobile , she felt dizzy and weak , and she began to feel only barely conscious , " the suit continued			0
@entity4 then gave her another drug , she said , and led her to the sofa , where she says she was sexually molested			2
" when @entity142 awoke , her clothes and undergarments were in disarray , " the suit said			0
@entity99 later returned to her native @entity144 , where she reported the incident to police			0
authorities in @entity148 , @entity149 , followed up with an investigation , but at the end of february declined to press criminal charges due to a lack of evidence			0
@entity4 's lawyer , @entity155 , told @entity0 the allegations were " utterly preposterous " and " plainly bizarre , " but @entity4 later acknowledged his role in the situation			1
" looking back on it , i realize that words and actions can be misinterpreted by another person , and unless you 're a supreme being , you ca n't predict what another individual will do , " he told the @entity159 in march 2005			0
" i 'm not saying that what i did was wrong , but i apologize to my loving wife , who has stood by my side for all these years , for any pain i have caused her			0
these allegations have caused my family great emotional stress			2
" @entity174 filed her civil suit in march 2005			0
@entity99 's lawyers said they found 13 @entity178 witnesses with similar stories			2
however , @entity174 's suit was settled in november 2006 , and the witnesses were never called			2
terms have not been disclosed			0
tarnished reputation as @entity186 's recent @entity4 biography makes clear , the man has his demons			1
he had affairs while on the road and there have been bumps in his long marriage to his wife , @entity193			0
the influence of @entity4 but @entity186 , a former @entity0 managing editor , told @entity0 that he did n't feel comfortable airing the rape allegations			1
" basically , i knew that i was going to have to be very careful in what i said about his private life			0
i felt that way as a journalist and also for legal reasons , " he said in an interview about the biography			0
" in the case of these other allegations , basically because there were no definitive court findings , no independent witnesses , it did n't meet my standard for what i was going to put in the book			2
" " i also was very aware that if i just did a she said - he said , and i printed allegations and denials without my own independent reporting , first of all it 's not really in the spirit in the book , but also every person who then reviewed or reported on the book would be free to repeat those unconfirmed allegations just because they were in my book			2
and i just did n't feel comfortable being responsible for that			0
" still , the rape allegations are always just a mouse click away			1
not long after @entity174 's accusations hit the media , @entity76 went public with her claims on " today			0
" a few months later , another @entity178 , @entity229 , also spoke out			0
a third woman , @entity230 , came forward in 2006			0
@entity86 and @entity231 both gave interviews to @entity77 in early 2014			0
how all the controversy has affected @entity4 personally is unknown			2
he 's still scheduled to star in an @entity235 sitcom next year , and his skills as a comedian appear undiminished			2
last year 's concert movie , " @entity238 , " earned mostly positive reviews , and his recent comedy tour has also received praise			0
on saturday night , he appeared at the @entity242 and played to an appreciative crowd			0
" over the course of a non-stop two hours , he proves himself yet again to be an extraordinarily skilled storyteller , a performer who is acutely aware of his audience and in full of control of the room from start to finish , " wrote the @entity245 's @entity244			0
but his once - sterling reputation has taken a hit			0
the @entity256 , @entity257 and the @entity258 have all mentioned the rape allegations in stories , criticizing @entity4 to varying degrees			1
and comedian @entity44 , who later talked about the @entity4 allegations on @entity264 's radio show , said at a @entity265 show that he had asked fellow comedian @entity266 for advice			1
@entity269 told @entity270 to talk to @entity4 , the @entity268 reported			2
but then @entity269 watched the @entity270 video			0
maybe it 's not a good idea after all , he said .			0

@entity4 's " meme me " *proposal* went awry monday
many *people* referred to allegations of rape against the comedian
@entity4 has repeatedly denied the allegations
in the internet age , the rape allegations have stubbornly remained in the open
