-- editor 's note : @entity3 is founder and ceo of @entity5 , a popular blog about social media			0
he is writing a weekly column about social networking and tech for @entity0			0
@entity12 ceo @entity11 told @entity14 's @entity13 this week that @entity12 would " definitely think about " adding a dislike button to the site , allowing users to express distaste for updates or pages on @entity12			2
but @entity11 is just humoring us : @entity12 will never add a dislike button , regardless of users ' demands			2
here 's why : demand for the dislike button there 's certainly some demand for dislikes			0
in answer to @entity13 's question on whether a dislike button would be considered , @entity11 replied : " we listen to all the user suggestions and it 's something that we 've thought about			0
you know , people like the like button so much ... i dunno , it 's something that we would definitely think about			0
people definitely seem to want it			0
" a @entity12 group for the concept has nearly 3.2 million fans , while there are at least two unofficial extensions for the @entity46 -- @entity47 and @entity48 -- that claim to add a dislike button for those users who install them			1
those clamoring for a " thumbs down " option seem to fall into two camps			0
for some , " liking " tragic news seems inappropriate -- and yet @entity12 does offer a " share " option on its own site , while third party sites can opt to use a " recommend " button instead			2
others simply want to express distaste for a page or news update -- this is a move @entity12 will never make , however , because it does n't align with the company 's interests			0
the role of the like button the like button serves numerous purposes for @entity12			0
one obvious benefit is that it lowers the psychological barrier to connecting with commercial entities on the site -- while previously users could " @entity78 " of a brand , they now imply " like " that brand 's page , resulting in higher engagement			0
another is that it increases clicks for web publishers : facebook users are more inclined to " like " a news article than they are to hit a " share " button			1
a third benefit : @entity12 aims to connect people who share similar interests			0
like buttons result in more connections , which creates more value			1
downside of dislike buttons a dislike button provides none of these benefits			1
in fact it would create significant tension between @entity12 , brands , and web publishers			1
imagine if @entity12 users could not only choose to " like " @entity108 , but were also provided the option to " dislike " the brand			2
would @entity12 become a more appealing place for brands to spend their marketing budgets and ad dollars ... or a less appealing one ? now imagine that websites could add " dislike " buttons to their pages			1
would web publishers rush to add this option , desperate for the negative feedback from their visitors ? hardly			1
and what about @entity12 's mission to " make the world more open and connected " ? while like buttons connect @entity12 users to their interests , dislike buttons serve no such purpose			1
like buttons are about connection ; dislike buttons are about division			2
in short , @entity12 will never add a dislike button because it would damage the company 's relationships with brands , businesses and web publishers -- these groups are essential for building both web traffic and ad revenue			1
like it or not , dislike buttons are n't coming to @entity12 anytime soon			1

a @entity12 group for the concept has nearly 3.2 million fans
like buttons result in more connections , which creates more value
dislike buttons would create tension between @entity12 , brands , web publishers
