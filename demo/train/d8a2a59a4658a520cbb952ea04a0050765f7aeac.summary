-- jockeys may rely on real live horsepower to help them reach the winning post , but they still train like athletes			1
when you are riding half a ton of flesh at 40 mph you have to be able to hold your horse			0
the riders , as well as their runners , follow a strict fitness regime -- and the result is a proven formula for a well - balanced and healthy body			1
" fitness has changed massively from the days when jockeys were just turning up at the races and were drinking , " flat racing jockey @entity15 told @entity0			1
" now we 're at the peak of our fitness			2
it 's definitely not just sitting on a horse ! " in the @entity26 town of @entity27 , ex-jockey @entity24 runs a boot camp for jockeys at the @entity30			1
any budding jockey hoping to gain a license to ride from the @entity33 now has to pass a fitness assessment laid out by @entity24			1
getting race fit starts by building the key muscles used to guide the world 's speediest steeds to the finish			0
the legs , lower body and core are the three areas of the body on which jockeys focus in training			1
upper body strength is also crucial when it comes to controlling the horse			1
" if you looked at a jockey without clothes on , there are n't many who have an ounce of fat underneath the skin , " @entity24 told @entity0			2
" it 's literally muscle and bone			2
jockeys are incredibly well - toned athletes in the same way that @entity65 champions @entity66 or @entity67 are			2
" racing fit jockey training is not for the faint of heart , or those who like a lie - in			2
@entity15 trains six days a week -- and only allows himself a rest on sunday mornings			1
" i 'm up around half past five or six most mornings , " the 27 - year - old explained			0
" i 'd then spend two and a half hours riding out			0
" then i 'll have a cycle -- i ride 150 miles each week			2
the aerobic fitness from the cycling is what gets you through the season			2
" before the season starts , i 'm at the gym with a personal trainer three mornings a week working on basic strength and a bit of boxing thrown in there as well			1
" in the afternoons i go racing , and race riding keeps you pretty fit too			0
" jockeys can also top up their conditioning at the @entity30 's training suite in @entity27			1
here resident fitness coach @entity96 , a former basketball player , oversees bleep tests , squats ( at the wall and standing on wobble cushions ) , timed sit - ups , push and pull band exercises and the dreaded plank			2
all these exercises in some way replicate the crouched racing stance adopted by jockeys -- the so - called " @entity108 " position			2
this precarious pose also asks the riders to summon balancing skills , and this is tested on the " equisizer " -- a cross between a rocking horse and a bucking bronco			0
complete with a swishing tail and cozy blanket , the equisizer is a lifesize , legless horse which simulates the forwards and backwards rhythm that jolts jockeys during the races			1
it is used , along with other simulators like @entity24 's own @entity127 device , to help jockeys stay balanced -- and stay on the horse			2
" balance and fitness are equally important for jockeys but balance must come first , " explained @entity24			1
" in the same way that in yoga you need to hold those positions for a period of time , a jockey also needs core stability to maintain his balance			1
" one meal a day maintaining equilibrium is also important for jockeys when it comes to their weight			1
they are put under enormous pressure to meet weight requirements			0
in the @entity150 and @entity151 , the minimum riding weight is 53 kg for the leaner flat racing jockeys and 61.5 kg for jump jockeys			2
the majority are naturally slim and slight , so their fitness regimes do not tend to be focused on weight loss , although the amount of intensive training and riding does help keep off the pounds			2
" i 'm lucky that i can literally eat whatever i want and i wo n't get any heavier than 53 kg , " explained @entity15 , who started riding when he was 12			1
" but some of the other guys struggle with one meal a day			0
mentally , it 's a big task not to be eating			0
" the @entity30 also helps jockeys maintain a balanced diet by offering advice from nutritionists			0
there is also a jockey cook book which includes calorie - counted recipes such as @entity175 beans and rice , and spicy sausage hot pot. not just about the horse but , in the same way that motorsport drivers rely on the horsepower of their car engines , are n't jockeys mainly relying on real horsepower to win races ? @entity24 concedes that the work level is split 90 % to 10 % in favor of the horse			1
but @entity15 , who has ridden more than 350 winners , believes jockeys can lose races if they are not physically fit			1
" people say , ' it 's the horse , you just have to sit there , ' but we have proved that fitness definitely comes into it , " he reasoned			0
" it may only be 10 % us but if we 're only 50 % fit then the jockey can only commit 5 % of the work during a race			1
" if we 're not as fit as we can be then we 're definitely affecting the horse			0
" as an example , he cited last weekend 's @entity207 , a team event held at @entity151 's @entity209 where jockeys compete for international teams			0
" the @entity26 and @entity213 jockeys were so much fitter than the jockeys from the rest of the world			0
you could see at the finish they were n't as strong			0
" to show how hard it is to train like a jockey , @entity24 put @entity222 anchor @entity221 through his physical tests for @entity0 's @entity225 show			0
at the @entity226 @entity30 , @entity221 was unseated on his first ride on the equisizer			0
he also found he was no match for a professional jockey like @entity15			1
in @entity24 's fitness assessment , @entity221 managed to last 40 seconds in the sit - up test compared to the jockey average of 240 seconds , and while the average rider could stay in the stomach - clenching plank pose for 180 seconds , the journalist managed a third of that time			1
" i knew it was going to be hard but i did n't think it would be that tough , " @entity221 grimaced at the end of his grueling physical			0
" safe to say , i wo n't be applying for my racing license anytime soon ! " all - round fitness not everyone has the lean and light physique that is a prerequisite for becoming a jockey , but getting race fit can help anyone become a fitness thoroughbred			1
" the tools we use are all based around gym exercises that people do , " explained @entity24			0
" the simulator that i 've designed is based around preparing jockeys but it 's also very , very easily adaptable as a piece of gym equipment , similar to a rowing machine or a cross trainer			0
it 's an all - round fitness tool			0
" while following such a training regime might not ultimately help you ride a winner in the @entity266 or @entity267 , @entity15 agrees that the principles of the program have benefits for anyone wanting to get fit			1
" it 's good for an all - round level of fitness , " he added			0
" being fit makes everyday life so much easier			0

the @entity278 at @entity27 runs a fitness boot camp for jockeys
jockeys focus on core , legs and upper body strength but aim to avoid muscle mass
jockey @entity15 trains six days a week and races every day in the summer
success in races depends 90 % on horsepower and 10 % on jockey ability
