@entity0 -- toward the end of @entity4 secretary of state @entity6 's surprise appearance at the @entity9 conference wednesday , she told the story of a girl and her father in a developing country			1
" this teenage girl 's father expected to force her into early marriage , but she had been to school and she received a cow , perhaps through the @entity20 project , to encourage her to stay in school			2
when her father demanded she drop out of school and get married , she said no. when he insisted , she insisted right back			2
" and finally she pulled out her trump card : ' if i leave and get married , i 'm taking my cow , that cow belongs to me			0
she stayed in school , she was spared an early marriage , all because her father could n't bear to part with the cow			0
" @entity30 : @entity31 on oppression of women @entity34 devoted her talk to the importance of empowering women and girls around the world , and the audience of 700 at the @entity41 responded enthusiastically			1
" let women work and they drive economic growth across all sectors			0
send a girl to school even just for one year and her income dramatically increases for life , and her children are more likely to survive and her family more likely to be healthier for years to come			1
give women equal rights and entire nations are more stable and secure			0
deny women equal rights and the instability of nations is almost certain			0
" @entity34 said the goal of empowering women and girls is a " central tenet " of @entity4 foreign policy			1
" women 's equality is not just a moral issue , it 's not just a humanitarian issue , it is not just a fairness issue , " she said , " it is a security issue , it is a prosperity issue , and it is a peace issue			1
" therefore when i talk about why we need to integrate women 's issues into discussions at the highest levels everywhere in the world , i 'm not doing it just because i have a personal commitment or because president @entity75 cares about it			2
i 'm doing it because it 's in the vital interests of the @entity4			1
" @entity34 said the status of women will be a key part of a new document the @entity84 is planning to release this week			2
modeled on the @entity86 's review every four years of @entity4 defenses , the " quadrennial diplomacy and development review " will assess @entity4 foreign policy			1
@entity30 : @entity89 on women and wartime @entity34 spoke of an array of initiatives and programs the @entity84 is using , many involving technology that can empower women			1
among them is a program in the wartorn @entity99 that enables women who are the victims of violence to record and transmit their testimony in criminal cases through the use of mobile phones			0
@entity34 's talk did not mention the ongoing worldwide controversy over the release of thousands of @entity4 diplomatic cables by @entity110			1
she did pay tribute to @entity113 , who died the day before her talk			0
" she lived with a fierce intelligence , a passion , a sense of purpose , " @entity34 said			2
" she would have appreciated this event , where we are coming together to look for solutions			0
" the @entity123 conference was a new event organized by @entity30 , a nonprofit that runs conferences and makes talks available on its website , and by the @entity128			0
@entity34 said the effort to empower women and girls faces cultural barriers : " the low value that many families and societies place on girls makes possible many of the worst abuses they suffer			1
but even among girls who are spared the worst , too often it is a girl who is still the first to drop out of school , the last to be fed , the last to receive medical care			2
and in too many places , she is taught there are special limits to what is possible for her			0
" we need to reach out to faith leaders and community leaders to change the perception and treatment of girls , and to persuade men and boys to value their sisters and their daughters , their talents and their intrinsic worth			0
