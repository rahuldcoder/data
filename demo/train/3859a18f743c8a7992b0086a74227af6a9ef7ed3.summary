-- after @entity4 's @entity3 beat @entity6 's @entity5 in the @entity8 basketball finals sunday , some people on @entity2 responded with vile anti-semitic tweets			1
" now i understand @entity12 and his hate for @entity14 , " one tweet read			1
that user removed the tweet and is now apologizing profusely , tweeting that his " empty words " were a joke and that he never meant to offend			0
another hateful tweet said the @entity3 team would hit the showers after the game , " but in the gas chamber , i hope			2
" that user appears to have removed his as well			0
he also retweeted an op - ed from the @entity6 newspaper @entity26 arguing that while concern about hateful tweets makes sense , such offenses should not be considered illegal			1
but to some leaders of @entity14 communities in @entity6 , these and numerous other tweets crossed a legal line			1
" we are standing up and saying enough is enough			0
we 're not going to allow this anymore , " @entity36 , chairman of the @entity37 , told @entity0 on wednesday			0
various @entity14 groups have come together to file a legal complaint calling for the offenders to be punished			1
" to send a message to @entity6 that this is not ok , " @entity36 said			2
it 's not that the groups want these people incarcerated , he said			1
but they want some kind of sentence			0
" there is a problem with @entity51 in @entity6			2
i want them to fix this problem , " he said			0
he pointed to a recent global study published by the @entity55 that found one in four adults worldwide are " deeply infected with anti-semitic attitudes			2
" in @entity6 , the study found , 29 % of the adult population believed most of the anti-semitic stereotypes in the survey -- the third highest number in @entity63 after @entity64 at 69 % and @entity65 at 37 %			1
' unprecedented ' global study finds 1 in 4 adults anti-semitic @entity69 nations do n't have the same freedom of expression protections that the @entity72 does			0
" when you cross a line , you face a problem , " said @entity36			0
unclear how many anti-semitic tweets many of the offensive tweets used a hashtag that included an expletive followed by " judios , " which means @entity14			1
a software program found about 17,500 such tweets at the point that the @entity14 groups complained , @entity36 said			1
the complaint triggered global headlines citing this number of anti-semitic tweets			1
but in fact , many of those tweets were from people saying how offensive the hashtag was			2
in the interview with @entity0 , @entity36 said the groups do n't know how many of the tweets using the hashtag actually were anti-semitic			1
when hashtags trend that are offensive against any group , it 's often due to a mix of people saying offensive things and those calling out the offensive messages			2
the same happened this week in @entity65 with the hashtag " @entity107 , " thanking @entity12 for @entity109 groups want @entity2 users @entity112 'd @entity36 said his and other groups have identified five of the offending @entity2 users			1
and he wants more of them identified			0
it 's an issue @entity2 has faced repeatedly in recent years			1
last year , a @entity65 court demanded that @entity2 identify those who post hate speech , the technology website @entity123 reported in a story on @entity0			2
in 2012 , under pressure from the @entity65 advocacy group @entity126 , @entity2 agreed to remove some offensive tweets			1
also that year , at @entity130 's request , @entity2 suspended a @entity132 neo-nazi account based in the city of @entity134 , marking the first time the company had responded to such a government request , the report said			1
" we work very hard to protect people 's experiences on @entity2 , but sadly there are a small amount of people in this world who are intent on causing distress for others both offline and online , " @entity2 said wednesday in a statement sent to @entity0			1
" on @entity2 we have rules which govern how people can behave and targeted abuse and direct threats of violence are against our rules			1
when they sign up , @entity2 users agree to respect them			2
" with more than 500 million tweets a day , " we rely on our users to report content " that violates rules , the statement said			0
to report any tweet , a user can open it , click " more , " and then " @entity164			0
" a real person ends up reviewing it			0
on its site called " @entity169 , " @entity2 lists information requests from governments , removal requests and copyright notices			2
the company also works with different countries to provide information within different legal systems , and posts its moves at the website chillingeffects.org			0
@entity180 sees this effort as a sign of what @entity14 people in @entity6 have been going through			1
" we 've been hidden for many years , " he said			0
" we did n't want to appear , did n't want to make noise			0
" he cites the @entity188 , which began in the 1400s and was not officially abolished until the 19th century			0
" it 's time to say , ' we are home , we have equal rights , we have the same opportunities as everyone , ' " @entity36 said			0
" we need to educate people			0
