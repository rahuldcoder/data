deforestation is a term that is used a lot in environmental reporting and it 's easy to forget exactly what that word means			1
one of the reasons why we came to @entity8 was to help people understand what deforestation looks like and why it 's a problem from the perspective of those on the ground watching it happen			1
when it comes to deforestation in @entity18 , it has had a devastating effect			1
@entity20 estimates that half of @entity8 's forest cover has disappeared from 1985 to 2008			1
the forest cover has gone from 50 % to 25 %			2
that means , within my lifetime , the landscape of the island of @entity8 has completely changed			1
deforestation means taking a forest and destroying it			2
all of the trees , plants , insects , animals and people who live there are either killed or forced to find a new home			1
once a forest is cut down , the plant species all are gone			2
insects and animals might make it out to find new homes , but that might include areas populated by humans , making their survival questionable			2
read more : @entity18 's indigenous villages in flux the indigenous people who live in the forest have to relocate to another area of forest or out of the forest altogether			1
this is a complete life change			2
the infrastructure , the way they provide for their families and the very basic way they live their lives would be completely different			2
deforestation in @entity18 is a byproduct of industrial attempts to sell timber or plant a palm oil or acacia plantation			1
in essence , these forests are cut down to make money			2
but money is important , so a compromise needs to be reached			2
there has to be a way to make money without destroying forests , wildlife habitat and indigenous peoples ' way of life			1
@entity18 is trying to do the right thing			1
the government has halted the cutting of virgin forest , also known as primary forest			0
this is untouched forest that has never been logged			0
@entity88 was created in the 1990s to protect some of the rainforest			0
it is almost 144,000 hectares , but represents only a small portion of @entity8 's rainforest			1
much of the forested areas of @entity8 that are not privately owned or protected like @entity88 are a patchwork of land divided up into concessions			1
these patches of forest are owned by the government and leased to different companies for different uses			0
unfortunately , many of those uses involve cutting down critical wildlife habitat			0
interactive : mission to save @entity8 's rainforest @entity106 , @entity18 director for the @entity107 ( @entity107 ) has released more than 140 endangered @entity109 orangutans ( mostly former pets ) into the area of the rainforest near @entity113			1
the intention was for the orangutans to roam free in the national park , but orangutans do n't respect human boundaries			0
they prefer the lowlands , areas surrounding @entity113 that are industrial concessions			0
these areas have been selectively logged , taking out the larger trees for timber			0
conservationists think of it as an acceptable compromise			0
this process also allows fruit trees to thrive and multiply			0
orangutans are herbivores who prefer a diet of fruit , so they naturally migrate to those lowland areas			0
leasing these lands to industries that would clear cut this forest would deeply affect this small orangutan population			0
it could undo all the work @entity106 and his orangutan team have accomplished over the past decade			1
orangutans are not the only animals affected by deforestation			0
critically endangered @entity109 elephants and tigers like the lowlands too			0
but this area is n't what 's protected			1
the lowland is a moneymaker			0
it 's easier to navigate than the hilly areas , making it prime land for logging and pulp or palm oil plantations			2
sometimes the government concludes the economic benefits are greater than the conservation needs			0
but ngos like @entity20 and @entity107 are hoping to change minds about the importance of these concessions being marked for conservation			0
the hope is to save the critical areas and find other patches of land less ideal for wildlife or indigenous people that can still generate an economic benefit .			1
