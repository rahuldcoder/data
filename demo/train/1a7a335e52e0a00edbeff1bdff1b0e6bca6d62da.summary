-- @entity1 worked as @entity3 oil minister from march of 1987 to october 1990			1
he left @entity4 shortly after the invasion by @entity6 of @entity7 in august 1990 and retired from government service in 1991			2
since then he has been working as a consultant in @entity10 , @entity11			0
@entity12 caught up with mr @entity1 at the @entity13 in @entity14 this week to ask him about what 's driving surging oil prices , the future of the @entity18 , and tensions in the region			1
@entity1 : none of us had expected that Â£ 93 would be reached so quickly			0
there had been some speculation that maybe $ 100 is achievable but i think it has happened too fast within the past few weeks			0
it is related to so many factors , so many elements and so many reasons			0
you can not just say that it is a result of the value of the dollar			0
definitely it is one hell of a factor because the value of the dollar has depreciated compared with six major currencies in the world			0
@entity41 : but let 's take a look first at demand here			2
some economists are scaling down their expectations for growth in the @entity48 and in @entity49			1
is the demand outside of the @entity51 strong enough to underpin the prices that we see today ? @entity54 : yes of course , everybody now is talking about the increasing quantities and demand from @entity59 and @entity60			1
@entity59 will certainly consume as much oil as the @entity48 , maybe in 2020			1
the same thing with @entity60			1
the rate of growth is increasing tremendously			2
and there is going to be a strong demand in general , maybe not as much from @entity49 and the @entity51 countries , but definitely from the new giants			2
@entity69 : what is your biggest concern politically in the region right now ? we 're talking about tensions between @entity76 and @entity4 and the @entity78 region			1
and you say there is not a lot of production coming out of that area , but the tensions could overspill into @entity83			1
what 's the potential down for here ? @entity54 : i do n't think that the tension between @entity76 and the @entity78 will have much influence on the price of oil			1
but @entity83 , with the question of the nuclear file and the possibility of the @entity48 taking military action against @entity83 , that is a possibility			1
why ? because you have about 18 to 20 million barrels a day that are being exported through the @entity100			0
and whether @entity83 blocks the @entity101 or they retaliate by attacking some oil installations in the region , then you have 18 or 20 million barrels a day off the market			1
if this happens , do n't be surprised if you reach $ 150 or even $ 200			0
@entity69 : in @entity4 right now , they 're talking about a national oil law			2
that 's in draft form			0
will that actually be the subject that breaks @entity4 apart ? @entity54 : oil certainly could be one major element			2
if the politicians who are running the country now go ahead and try to divide the oil wealth among various regions as they had drafted in the revenue - sharing law , then i would say that is going to lead to the break up of the country			0
@entity69 : meanwhile we have different regions like the @entity78 region signing contracts with @entity48 and @entity49 oil companies for production agreements			1
will these contracts be recognized in the next year as valid ? @entity54 : they started , or in fact they never stopped , negotiations with a number of companies			0
so within the last four or five weeks , they have signed five different contracts			0
one of them is @entity48 , and that 's the one that made the news , and that is @entity142			1
and all these contracts , according to the central government , are illegal			0
this is because they have not been done with the blessing of the central government			0

@entity152 was @entity3 oil minister between 1987 and 1990
future demand for oil , he says , will be *spurred* by growth in @entity60 and @entity59
tension between @entity76 and @entity78 will not have *impact* on oil prices , he adds
but if @entity48 takes military action against @entity83 , oil prices could surge
