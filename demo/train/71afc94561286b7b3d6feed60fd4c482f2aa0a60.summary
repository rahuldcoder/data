-- eight weeks after the terrorist attacks on the @entity4 mission in @entity5 , @entity6 , that killed four @entity4 , it is encouraging that @entity7 is finally serious about examining the events surrounding that day			1
as the chairman of the @entity10 , rep. @entity11 , said on " @entity12 " recently , this was not an intelligence failure			0
but failures clearly happened elsewhere , particularly in the @entity16			0
@entity16 documents revealed that slain ambassador to @entity6 @entity19 and others had warned several times of " growing problems with security " and violence in eastern @entity6 , where @entity5 is located , after the fall of @entity26 and after the @entity27 moved its governing headquarters from @entity5 to @entity29 in september 2011			1
@entity19 ' predecessor ambassador @entity30 had also sent cables to the @entity16 warning of the deepening security crisis in @entity6			1
well before the @entity5 attack , our intelligence agencies , @entity35 and @entity16 cables from the @entity36 in @entity6 all warned of a growing security crisis			1
they said terrorists from across the region , including @entity45 elements believed to be associated with @entity46 , were able to travel freely into the country to recruit , organize , plan attacks and procure weapons			0
this is not to suggest these attacks were planned months in advance			0
we do n't know , but we do know that they were premeditated			0
we also know that the @entity54 believed the @entity5 tragedy on september 11 was the work of terrorists within hours of the attacks			1
conducting diplomacy on behalf of the @entity4 is not without risks			2
@entity4 foreign service officers and members of the diplomatic corps understand this			2
i think it is important that the @entity4 continue to show the flag in far - flung corners of the world , some of which may often be dangerous			0
@entity71 : @entity73 obsession with @entity5 makes no sense diplomats like @entity19 thrive on engaging with the local population			1
that important work must continue in @entity6 , @entity78 , @entity79 and other countries that pose difficulties			0
however , the @entity4 government has a responsibility to ensure that our posts overseas are properly fortified and defended , based on the security situation on the ground			1
we know that the security at the @entity4 mission in @entity5 and the @entity54 annex was woefully inadequate			1
it should have been fortified , and more reliable security forces were clearly needed to defend those facilities			0
immediate access to heavier weapons may have saved lives			0
it is important to decide which elements of the @entity4 national security structure should be available to support the defense and extraction of @entity4 diplomats and personnel if they come under fire			1
the @entity16 needs a clear procedure , understood by all , to communicate with the @entity35 or the @entity54 in emergencies			0
we need to resolve why the nearest defense rescue team was six hours away and why teams were n't deployed that might have been able to save the lives of the two @entity4 at the @entity54 annex who died in the early hours of september 12			1
although there are no obvious targets for fighter jets , the mere presence of an @entity4 or allied @entity120 nearby could strongly deter attackers			0
because the uppermost purpose of any inquiry is to prevent such a tragedy from happening again , we need to know what measures secretary of state @entity126 has taken to ensure that decisions about security and requirements of @entity4 diplomatic missions are given the highest priority			1
we understand from congressional testimony that the deputy assistant secretary for international programs in the @entity135 has broad authority over the allocation of security resources , with life and death consequences for our diplomats			0
given the vulnerability of nontraditional posts like @entity5 , we should determine whether higher - level officials should oversee security issues			2
if not , we must be sure that anyone assuming such a position is adequately qualified in overseas security operations and threat analysis			0
we must also ensure that clear mechanisms are in place to enable a seamless emergency response among the different agencies that share responsibility			0
on all these counts , we have more questions right now than answers			0
it is very important to establish how far the @entity4 commitment to @entity6 extends			1
while the @entity4 played a role in helping the @entity161 overthrow @entity26 , we need to assess how this attack affects our plan for a @entity6			1
i believe the @entity4 has a responsibility to help the @entity161 develop their defense services through the expansion of the @entity35 's section 1206 training and equipment programs			2
the @entity4 must also support the @entity161 in forging a new constitution that respects the rights of all and begins to restore governance to their country			2
@entity4 have watched recent developments in @entity6 with great sadness and concern			2
we have a strong interest in helping a secular , pro-american government that rejects @entity182 extremism take root			1
unfortunately , this attack and the confusion stemming from the administration 's response have led some to conclude that @entity6 is more trouble than it 's worth			2
but our interests in @entity6 are worth pursuing , and getting answers and developing solutions to prevent future tragedies are critical to our national interest			1
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity196 .			0

@entity196 : answers from @entity7 ' @entity5 inquiry will help prevent another tragedy
@entity196 : ambassador @entity19 , others warned of deepening security crisis
security at the @entity4 consulate and the @entity54 annex was woefully inadequate , he says
@entity196 : it 's critical @entity4 helps support a secular , pro-american government in @entity6
