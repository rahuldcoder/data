@entity0 -- president @entity2 used his first @entity4 address to the nation tuesday to say 90 percent of the oil gushing into the @entity7 will be captured within weeks , and to call for a new clean energy policy to end @entity10 dependence on fossil fuels			1
the 18 - minute speech , televised nationally , described what happened in the april 20 explosion and fire on a @entity7 oil rig that led to what @entity2 called " the worst environmental disaster @entity10 has ever faced			1
" he compared the millions of gallons of oil leaking into the ocean to an epidemic " we will be fighting for months and even years			0
" @entity2 meets wednesday with the chairman of oil giant @entity25 , which owns the broken well at the bottom of the @entity7 , and the president made clear he expects @entity25 to pay all clean - up costs and damages from the massive leak			1
he said he will tell @entity25 chairman @entity31 to " set aside whatever resources are required to compensate the workers and business owners who have been harmed as a result of his company 's recklessness			0
" " this fund will not be controlled by @entity25 , " @entity2 said			2
" in order to ensure that all legitimate claims are paid out in a fair and timely manner , the account must and will be administered by an independent , third party			0
" in response to @entity2 's speech , a @entity25 spokesperson said the company shared the president 's goals of " shutting off the well as quickly as possible , cleaning up the oil and mitigating the impact on the people and environment of the @entity55 , " and looked forward to wednesday 's meeting " for a constructive discussion about how best to achieve these mutual goals			1
" earlier , senior administration officials told reporters that negotiations on the @entity25 fund were continuing , with one major unresolved issue being whether workers who lose their jobs due to the government 's six - month moratorium on offshore drilling will be eligible to file damage claims			2
@entity71 critics have complained the moratorium is eliminating badly needed jobs as the nation recovers from economic recession , but @entity2 said the government must ensure the safety of such deep - water operations before allowing them to continue			1
@entity2 said he knows the moratorium " creates difficulty for the people who work on these rigs			0
" " but for the sake of their safety , and for the sake of the entire region , we need to know the facts before we allow deep - water drilling to continue , " he said			0
@entity2 also called the @entity7 oil disaster " the most painful and powerful reminder yet that the time to embrace a clean energy future is now			1
" the @entity10 must end its dependence on fossil fuels , he said , calling for @entity96 to rise above partisan politics to take on the challenge of passing energy reform legislation that will lead the way to development of a clean energy economy			2
in an attempt to counter complaints of a sluggish government response to the oil disaster , @entity2 noted cited resources have poured into the region including nearly 30,000 people working in four states to contain and clean up the oil , along with " thousands of ships and other vessels			1
" he said he had authorized deployment of more than 17,000 @entity115 members along the coast to be used as needed by state governors			0
@entity71 responses , some distributed to reporters before the speech began , criticized @entity2 for using the oil disaster to push his energy reform policies , which @entity71 critics say will increase energy prices and eliminate jobs			1
" every day seems to bring more bad news about the size and scope of this crisis , and reversing that trend should be the president 's priority , " said @entity127 minority leader @entity126 , @entity128			0
" the @entity137 may view this oil spill as an opportunity to push its agenda in @entity0 , but @entity10 are more concerned about what it plans to do to solve the crisis at hand , " @entity136 said			1
he complained the energy reform legislation supported by @entity2 also is endorsed by @entity25 and will " raise energy prices for every @entity10 family and business " but " wo n't end our dependence on foreign oil or protect the coastline and marshes of the @entity55			1
" sen. @entity154 , @entity155 , said the administration 's focus should be on stopping the leak , not pushing @entity2 's policies			2
" i am concerned the administration is attempting to capitalize on public outrage over the spill in order to push through a cap - and - trade bill that will significantly raise energy prices for all @entity10 and add more burdens on businesses , " @entity154 said in a statement			2
" right now , the president 's number one priority needs to be keeping the jobs in the energy sector from going overseas and restoring the @entity7			0
" environmentalists supported @entity2 's call for @entity96 to pass energy reform legislation , with former vice president @entity177 , now chairman of the @entity178 , saying that " in the midst of the greatest environmental disaster in our country 's history , there is no excuse to do otherwise			1
" ultimately , @entity177 said in statement , " the only way to prevent this type of tragedy from happening again is to fundamentally change how we power our economy			0
" earlier tuesday , @entity2 named @entity192 to direct the federal government 's efforts to regulate offshore oil drilling			2
@entity192 , who was a @entity196 inspector general in the @entity198 administration , will oversee the reorganized agencies that formerly comprised the @entity200 in the @entity201			0
@entity137 press secretary @entity202 told @entity203 on tuesday morning that @entity2 's goal is to " restore the @entity7 , not just the way it was the day the rig exploded , but years ago			1
" presidents have tackled a variety of topics in @entity4 speeches -- from the challenger disaster in 1986 to the attacks of september 11 , 2001			0
energy was last a topic in 1979 , when @entity215 spoke about @entity10 's inability to overcome the energy crisis			0
while @entity2 has dealt with major issues including the wars in @entity221 and @entity222 and a major economic downturn since taking office in january 2009 , he had never spoken to the public from the @entity4 until now			2
@entity1 's @entity226 , @entity227 , @entity228 , @entity229 , @entity230 and @entity231 contributed to this report .			0
