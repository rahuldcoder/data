-- @entity2 's two daughters had another reason to high - five their dad 's election to the presidency tuesday night : they 're getting a puppy			1
president @entity10 's dog @entity8 walks in the @entity11 in 2007			1
" @entity15 and @entity16 , " @entity2 said in his victory speech at @entity14 's @entity13 , " i love you both so much , and you have earned the new puppy that 's coming with us to the @entity20			1
" the new @entity20 pet will follow in the paw - steps of a menagerie of animals that have had the run of @entity26 over the years			2
the @entity10 family shared their eight years at the @entity20 with a cat , a feisty @entity31 springer spaniel and two @entity33 terriers -- all of whom have their own pages on the president 's web site			1
the @entity41 ' @entity40 stay included a cat , socks , who did not get along with their chocolate @entity45 , @entity47			0
and @entity48 the springer spaniel 's canine view of life in the @entity20 -- as " told to " then - first lady @entity52 -- became a best - seller that outsold the memoirs of president @entity10			1

and perhaps the strangest of all : @entity83 @entity82 briefly owned two tiger cubs , a gift from the @entity86			1
pets have sometimes been a boon to a president 's image			2
but some have also taken a bite out of their popularity			0
animal lovers howled in protest when @entity96 picked up his beagles , @entity98 and her , by the ears to provide photographers a better view			0
on the other hand , @entity103 -- running for vice president and accused of accepting illegal campaign contributions -- successfully defended himself in his famous " @entity107			0
" the only gift he ever accepted was " a little cocker spaniel dog " that his daughter named @entity107 , @entity103 said			0
" and i just want to say this , right now , that regardless of what they say about it , we are going to keep it , " he added			0
come january , the @entity16 will make history by becoming the first @entity120 - @entity119 family to move into the @entity20			1
