-- in the next five years , there are likely to be as many mobile cellular subscriptions as there are people on this planet			2
by 2020 , pundits predict more than 50 billion connected devices			0
with seven billion people 's needs to serve , information and communications technologies ( @entity12 ) represent the single most powerful channel we have ever had to reach out to others , wherever they may live , whatever their circumstances			1
they also represent our best hope of accelerating progress towards meeting the @entity20 ( @entity20 ) by the target date of 2015			1
can @entity22 reach its 2015 @entity20 ? if countries embrace the unique power of mobile broadband technology , i believe many have a good chance			1
the eight @entity20 can not be separated			1
if you combat disease , you also reduce child mortality ; if you give every child a primary education , you promote gender equality			0
it is because these goals are interlinked that broadband is so important			2
if we classify the @entity20 into three broad areas -- education , health , and the environment -- we see that mobile broadband has a key role to play in each			1

around 90 % of children in the developing world are enrolled in primary school , but in some regions -- notably @entity22 -- up to 30 % of children drop out before their final primary year			1
broadband can better engage children , equipping them with valuable @entity12 skills and opening a window on the world 's information resources , in a multitude of languages			1
from simple sms reminders for vaccinations or anti-retroviral treatments , to grassroots information gathering on demographics and diseases , to mobile information repositories for personal health records , cellphones are becoming a key cornerstone of health programs in a growing number of @entity81 countries			1
every year , more than half a million women die as a result of complications in pregnancy and childbirth			0
the tragedy is that the majority of these deaths are preventable -- yet in @entity22 , fewer than half of all births are attended by a midwife or skilled health worker			1
while there is no substitute for the physical presence of a healthcare professional , broadband is helping train community field workers , while providing expectant mothers and their extended families with simple advice that protects health -- and lives			1
the @entity20 on ensuring environmental sustainability spans a wide range of targets , from the provision of safe drinking water and basic sanitation , to protecting biodiversity and improving the lives of slum - dwellers			1
in many of these areas , broadband will be a vital link			2
for example , so - called " smart " electricity grids make it easier for locally generated electricity ( including from renewable sources ) to be integrated , stored and shared as demand fluctuates			0
broadband can also help local farmers and fishermen by delivering weather forecasts directly to their mobile phones and providing information on sustainable farming techniques			1

innovative projects are improving the lives of slum - dwellers -- for example in @entity141 -- through providing access to employment and training			0
last year at @entity146 2011 , the @entity145 awarded a prize to a young entrepreneur who developed an education platform for working children , enabling them to use smartphones to improve their literacy , numeracy and general knowledge while they travel to work on public transport vehicles equipped with low - cost @entity157 repeaters			2
broadband gives small businesses the opportunity to broaden their customer base and reduce their overheads through e-commerce platforms			2
and it will support advanced financial services for consumers , building on the outstanding success of the @entity169 mobile banking model , an excellent example of innovation coming directly out of @entity22 to solve @entity81 problems			1
the eighth and final @entity20 is " developing a global partnership for development			1
" it is , perhaps , the most fundamental of all the goals , because it enables progress towards all the other goals			0
developing such a partnership is a basic element of our work at @entity145			0
because we understand the incredible potential of broadband , we launched the @entity184 to help move broadband to the top of the political agenda			2
this multi-stakeholder commission comprises over 50 top - level global leaders , and has defined a vision for accelerating the deployment of broadband networks worldwide			0
it has also established four critical targets that we believe all countries should to strive to attain by 2015 : @entity196 1 : making broadband policy universal			0
by 2015 , all countries should have a national broadband plan or strategy or include broadband in their universal access / service definitions			0
@entity196 : making broadband affordable			0
by 2015 , entry - level broadband services should cost less than 5 % of average monthly income			0
@entity196 3 : connecting homes to broadband			0
by 2015 , 40 % of households in developing countries should have internet access			0
@entity196 4 : getting people online			0
by 2015 , internet user penetration should reach 60 % worldwide , 50 % in developing countries and 15 % in least - developed countries			0
we have only three years to go			0
but it is highly significant that among all the @entity20 targets the most advanced is the one involving @entity12			1
let 's capitalize on that and use @entity22 's near - ubiquitous mobile coverage to break old infrastructure bottlenecks and short - circuit the traditional development cycle			1
ubiquitous mobile broadband is a big idea whose time has come			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity228 .			2

mobile broadband can help @entity22 reach @entity20 , says @entity228
he argues that broadband can teach children information technology skills
mobile technology is transforming healthcare and banking , @entity228 says
