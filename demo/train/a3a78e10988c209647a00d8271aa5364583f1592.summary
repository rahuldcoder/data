-- human decisions have complex roots : history , circumstance , personality , even chance			2
so it 's a dangerous game to oversimplify reality , isolate causation and attribute any particular course of action to one or another singular motive			2
but let me tempt fate , since some recent government decisions suggest important issues for public discussion			2
over the past several weeks , press accounts have outlined a series of @entity21 administration moves dealing with the cyberdefense of the @entity23			1
according to one report , the @entity24 will add some 4,000 personnel to @entity27 , on top of a current base of fewer than a thousand			2
the command will also pick up a " national defense " mission to protect critical infrastructure by disabling would - be aggressors			2
a second report reveals another administration decision , very reminiscent of the @entity37 of preemption , to strike first when there is imminent danger of serious cyberattack against the @entity23			1
both of these represent dramatic and largely welcome moves			0
but they also suggest the failure of a deeper national policy process and , more importantly , the failure to develop national consensus on some very difficult issues			1
@entity51 military leading cyber attacks let me reason by analogy , and in this case the analogy is the program of targeted killings supported and indeed expanded by the @entity21 administration			1
again , i have no legal or moral objections to killing those who threaten us			1
we are , as the administration rightly holds , in a global state of war with @entity64 and its affiliates			1
but at the level of policy , killing terrorists rather than capturing them seems to be the default option , and part of that dynamic is fairly attributable to our inability to decide where to put a detainee once we have decided to detain him			1
@entity74 wo n't let him into the @entity23 unless he is going before a criminal court , and the administration will not send him to @entity77 despite the legitimate claim that a nation at war has the right to detain enemy combatants without trial			1
failing to come to agreement on the implications of the " we are at war " position , we have made it so legally difficult and so politically dangerous to detain anyone that we seem to default to killing those who would do us harm			1
clearly , it 's an easier path : no debates over the location or conditions of confinement			0
frequently such action can be kept covert			0
decision - making is confined to one branch of government			0
" courts are not involved			0
besides , we are powerful			0
we have technology at our fingertips			0
we know that we can be precise , and the professionalism of our combatants allows them to easily meet the standards of proportionality and distinction ( between combatants and noncombatants ) in such strikes , despite claims to the contrary			0
and we also believe that we can live with the second and third order effects of targeted killings			0
we believe that the care we show will set high standards for the use of such weapons by others who will inevitably follow us			0
we also believe that any long - term blowback ( akin to what gen. @entity124 calls the image of " arrogance " such strikes create ) is more than offset by the immediate effects on @entity23 's safety			1
i agree with much of the above			0
but i also fear that the lack of political consensus at home can drive us to routinely exercise an option whose long - term effects are hard to discern			1
which brings us back to last week 's stories on @entity23 cyberdefense			1
in the last @entity74 , there were two prominent bills introduced to strengthen @entity23 's cyberdefenses			1
neither came close to passing			0
in the @entity147 , the @entity146 created a near perfect storm with the @entity149 and the @entity150 weighing in strongly against the legislation			0
that two such disparate bodies had issues with the legislation should suggest how far we are from a national consensus			2
in the @entity161 , a modest proposal from the @entity158 to enhance cybersharing between the private sector and the @entity160 was met with a presidential veto threat over alleged privacy concerns and was never even considered by the @entity147			0
indeed , my preferred option -- a more active and well - regulated role for @entity160 and @entity27 on and for @entity23 networks -- is almost a third rail in the debate over @entity23 cybersecurity			1
the cybertalent and firepower at @entity173 , where both are headquartered , are on a short leash because few dare to even address what we would ask them to do or what we would permit them to do on domestic networks			0
and hence , last week 's " decisions			0
" rather than settle the roles of these institutions by dealing with the tough issues of security and privacy domestically , we have opted for a policy not unlike targeted killing			1
rather than opt for the painful process of building consensus at home , we are opting for " killing " threats abroad in their " safe haven			1
" we appear more willing to preempt perceived threats " over there " than spill the domestic political blood that would be needed to settle questions about standards for the defense of critical infrastructure , the role of government surveillance or even questions of information sharing			0
and we seem willing to live with the consequences , not unlike those of targeted killings , of the precedent we set with a policy to shoot on warning			2
i understand the advantage that accrues to the offense in dealing with terrorists or cyberthreats			2
i also accept the underlying legality and morality of preemptive drone or cyberstrikes			2
i just hope that we do n't do either merely because we do n't have the courage to face ourselves and make some hard decisions at home			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity225 .			1

@entity21 administration *beefing* up effort to counter cyberattacks
@entity225 says *emphasis* is on striking first , as the @entity23 does with drone attacks
*ex-cia* *director* says drone policy *reflects* lack of consensus on handling *prisoners*
@entity225 : is killing terrorists preferred because of division over how to try them ?
