-- just about every year , brilliant movies are utterly ignored by the @entity2			2
" @entity3 , " " @entity4 , " " @entity5 , " " @entity6 , " " @entity7 , " " @entity8 , " " @entity9 , " " @entity10 , " " @entity11 " — the @entity12 has a long history of overlooking comedies , action movies , horror flicks , hard - boiled genre pics , artsy foreign films , and documentaries that are n't about @entity20 this year , we 'll be taking a closer look at films that were too small , too weird , or perhaps simply too awesome for the @entity2			2
the film : affectionately known as " @entity27 's stripper movie , " the @entity29 film is about man at a crossroads : does " @entity40 " keep grinding his moneymaker to bank those singles he 's saving to start his own custom - furniture business , or , does mentoring a fresh face ( @entity37 ) for his shady boss ( @entity38 ) make him see that he 's losing more than he 's gained and hang up his g - string for good ? why it was n't nominated : @entity0 's @entity42 gave the movie an @entity44 , so we could pretend this had an actual chance to follow in @entity49 's footsteps and garner a nod as one of the year 's @entity52 ( or nine ) best pictures			1
but even with @entity29 's name attached , no one wanted to take this film seriously			1
( especially the people who paid to see it multiple times even though they thought there was n't enough stripping and that @entity64 , as @entity27 's love interest , was way too wooden			1
) the real snub here is that @entity38 , who 's picked up supporting actor honors from the @entity68 and @entity69 among others this awards season , did n't score his first @entity2 nomination for playing narcissistic club owner @entity73			1
the critics remember their summer raves for @entity38 's commitment , but the buzz had faded by the time @entity12 members got to voting : only one acting nomination this year came from a film with a @entity83 release date before september , and that 's @entity86 's lead actress @entity85			1
another uphill battle : all supporting actor nominees this year have not only been nominated before , they 've all won before			2
but perhaps the biggest mountain for @entity38 to climb was the idea that him playing a shirtless beefcake with a chill vibe and his eye on the prize ( moving the revue from @entity97 to @entity98 ) was n't a stretch			2
( we did n't penalize @entity101 for playing @entity103 's acerbic movie producer , did we ? ) ' following ' ratings grow in week 2 why history will remember it better than " @entity107 " : this is the film that secured @entity27 the title of @entity112 's @entity111 ( and will forever make of us think of him when we hear @entity115 's " pony " ) , but it was already legendary before that			1
there are multiple lessons here : 1			2
) how @entity27 turned what could have been an embarrassing leak — a video of him stripping in his younger days — into a film that 's grossed more than $ 113 million domestically and sparked talk of a sequel and a stage musical			1
he did n't try to bury his past ( as perhaps some of his reps wanted him to ) ; he knew there was a story in the comically dark , seedy world of male stripping , and he used his experience to inform it			1
that kind of honesty and sense of humor wins you fans			2
) media tours can be fun , which we learned watching @entity27 's remarkably game costar @entity144 body - roll his way around town			1
that 's also something we wo n't soon forget			1
) speaking again to @entity38 's snub specifically , just because a role seems a perfect fit does n't mean you should n't get credit for making it your own			1
as we found out when we went behind the scenes of the stripping numbers , in the original script @entity73 did n't even have a stripping scene			2
@entity38 wanted one , and knew exactly how it should play out : he 'd begin by serenading the women from the stage with a slow song			1
music supervisor @entity166 suggested she and @entity38 pen the tune with @entity170 , @entity38 's guitar coach			1
they wrote " ladies of @entity97 " in about three hours at @entity38 's hotel			1
" the song is silly as hell , but @entity38 swears it 's gon na get nominated for an @entity2			1
he keeps telling me i have to pick out my dress			2
and you know what , i am gon na submit it , " @entity166 told @entity0 before the film 's june 29 release			1
after the song , @entity38 wanted to blow fire , smash his guitar , and strip to @entity187 ' " calling dr. @entity186			1
" @entity190 's bro talks sis and drugs @entity38 worked with costume designer @entity192 on designing his thong			1
" @entity38 did n't want to wear , nor did i want him to wear , just a spandex thong			0
there was a rock ' n ' roll @entity198 feel to his clothing , and he kept talking about this specific coloring that a certain horse has			0
it just started occurring to me that maybe we were talking about a horse mane and fringe			0
he liked that idea , " @entity192 told @entity0 last summer			0
fringe placement was another discussion			0
" i started placing it at different places on the thong , and @entity38 said , ' right down the center , ' " @entity192 recalled			0
" initially , the fringe was a little out of control			0
it was like a horse 's mane			1
we trimmed it back and trimmed it back			0
when those pants came off and the silver and black patent fringe started catching the light , the reaction was in - @entity226			0
" as for the actual moves for the number , @entity38 had ideas for those , too			0
" he was so in it to be gross and raunchy , " choreographer @entity231 told @entity0			0
he came up with signature moves , like the " @entity233 " ( he licks his fingers and slides them down his pants )			0
" he was the one who had the most names for things , because we would call them out , " @entity231 said			0
" i 've never laughed as hard as i laughed watching him perform , only because it was so f — ing amazing			0
the women did not know what to do with themselves			0
the last thing he does in his routine is lie on the ground , and the girls were insane trying to tip him , shoving money in his g - string , and his g - string ripped off			0
he held it on with his hand			0
nothing will beat that to me			0
" as @entity192 said , when recalling that @entity38 's g - string also had a fringe tail , " @entity38 was out to outdo all the other boys			2
i do n't know that he succeeded necessarily , but he certainly committed something incredibly memorable to film for all time			2
