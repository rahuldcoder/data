-- @entity1 unveiled changes to its terms - of - use document on friday , tweaking earlier drafts in an apparent effort to ease users ' concerns about privacy and how their information is used			1
the proposed changes to the networking giant 's @entity12 come after the plan was opened up for user comments last month , and just weeks before @entity1 is expected to go public in a stock offering some expect could value the company at $ 100 billion			1
front and center in the announcement was an effort to explain that the way @entity1 collects and shares data is not being changed			1
" some of our users and a number of journalists mistook the proposed update to our @entity12 for changes to the way we collect or use data , " @entity1 said in a post on the site			1
" @entity36 ( which used to be called our privacy policy ) governs how we collect and use data			0
we are not proposing any updates to that document at this time			0
" @entity41 has slowed @entity1 's ascent to the top of the social - media world			2
what began as a dorm - room project for @entity47 and his @entity49 classmates grew into a phenomenon that has amassed more than 800 million active users			0
but if @entity1 has had an achilles heel , it 's been concerns about how user data is used			1
because it 's a free service , @entity1 depends on targeted advertising and a cut of the micro-payments users make in games and other apps running on the site			2
users ' activity on the site is used to paint a picture of them , and shared by @entity1 to help those advertisers pick their targets			1
web privacy advocates , including some government officials in the @entity71 and elsewhere , have repeatedly expressed unease with the sheer amount of data @entity1 possesses about its users and how that data may be used			1
it 's obvious that the company wants to tamp down user concerns about that in advance of its arrival on @entity83			1
in its filing to the @entity87 , the word " privacy " was used 35 times			0
that document , which is required for companies filing to go public , was obviously largely positive about @entity1 's upside			1
but when required to acknowledge potential downsides , @entity1 wrote that if users ever widely became concerned about their privacy and use of their data , they could lose some of them			1
@entity1 writes that it must avoid adopting " policies or procedures related to areas such as sharing or user data that are perceived negatively by our users or the general public			1
" @entity106 : @entity1 strips ' privacy ' from new ' data use ' policy explainer in a set of bulleted posts friday , @entity1 outlined the tweaks it has made in response to user feedback and explained items it says raised concerns			1
-- in a change first noted last month , the document now uses the term " @entity36 " instead of " @entity121			0
" @entity1 says this reflects a change that was made last year because they " believe the name is more descriptive of the information the document provides			2
" -- language that said " you or other that can see your content and information " was removed for a different definition of how and when apps can access data about your friends			0
it adds links to more information and how users can control that			0
-- @entity1 also clarified language saying that people should not " tag users if you know they do not wish to be tagged " in photos			2
that passage does n't change how tagging works , but is merely meant to be a guideline , the company said			0
-- the changes remove a line saying that @entity1 reserves the right to deny or limit access to users outside the @entity71			2
the site says that line was unclear and meant to reflect places where services are legally unavailable , or places where @entity1 is banned			2
the document also included a not - so - subtle swipe at one of @entity1 's chief competitors			2
" unlike other @entity171 companies , we propose updates to our @entity12 and give our users an opportunity to comment before they go into effect , " friday 's announcement said			0
" your insights and perspectives are really valuable to us , enabling us to respond to your questions and make substantive changes to address your concerns before changes are implemented			0
" earlier this year , @entity184 ( which has launched social platform @entity185 as a @entity1 rival ) rolled out significant changes to its privacy policy			0
while @entity184 went out of its way to publicize the changes to users , feedback was not as aggressively sought and did not appear , at least publicly , to lead to any major changes			0
facebook users can comment on the latest round of proposed changes until april 27 , the post said .			0

@entity204 says that the way user data is collected and shared will not change
