-- the patient slammed his fist on the table in dr. @entity5 's office			2
" dammit , i 'm @entity6 , " @entity5 remembers him saying			0
" you ca n't tell me i have prostate cancer and that we 're just going to ' watch it			1
' " @entity5 is the chief medical officer for the @entity11 , a world - renowned cancer expert and practicing oncologist			1
if you 're going to get someone 's opinion on a cancer diagnosis or course of treatment , he 's a good choice			1
and in this case , he was recommending no treatment			1
it 's a scenario that may happen more as science reveals cancer 's secrets , the biggest one being that what we now call cancer maybe should n't be called cancer at all			1
" the word ' cancer ' often invokes the specter of an inexorably lethal process , " a working group for the @entity34 wrote in a recent recommendation			1
" however , cancers are heterogeneous and can follow multiple paths , not all of which progress to metastases and death			0
" basically , cancer is scary , but some kinds may be more boogeyman - in - the - closet scary than serial killer scary			1
to understand fully , you have to look at the history of cancer diagnosis , @entity5 says			1
in the 1850s , a group of @entity54 pathologists did some of the first biopsies on people who had clearly died of cancer			1
they took samples of their tumors and decided what breast cancer looks like , what lung cancer looks like , etc. today , @entity5 says , there is a patient who has a lesion that 's approximately 5 millimeters in diameter -- smaller than a pea			1
there 's a doctor taking a biopsy of that lesion and a pathologist who 's analyzing the sample using 21st - century technology			0
the problem , @entity5 says , is that they 're still comparing the samples to the cancer definition that was created more than 150 years ago			1
" he 's going , ' this looks just like what those @entity54 said is breast cancer , ' " @entity5 said of the pathologist			1
" but it 's 5 millimeters in size			0
what killed the woman 160 years ago had spread all throughout her body			0
" we all harbor abnormalities , says @entity95 , @entity96 professor of medicine and author of the book " @entity100 : making people sick in the @entity102			0
" and new technology is increasingly able to find these abnormalities			0
when we do , our inclination is to act , even when the remedy turns out to be far more harmful than the disease would have been , had it run its course			0
there is a growing consensus , backed by mounting scientific evidence , that @entity6 tend to be overtested , overdiagnosed and overtreated across a variety of conditions			0
some experts estimate that unnecessary interventions account for 10 % to 30 % of @entity6 health care spending			1
part of the problem is our medical culture , @entity95 says			0
the physician may be engaging in what is known as " defensive medicine , " which entails ordering tests to guard against malpractice suits , should something go awry			1
there may also be perverse economic incentives at play -- that is , in a fee - for - service system , doctors are compensated for the quantity of tests and procedures they order			1
but a recent study of physicians with the @entity6 @entity138 found that salaried physicians who received no income from an increased volume of services and who had limited liability concerns ordered as many heart stress tests deemed " unnecessary " as doctors in more traditional settings			1
the researchers theorized that the doctors had " an exaggerated perception of benefit " of the tests			1
in an editor 's note on the study , dr. @entity152 observed that while the study sample was small , " neverthless , it suggests that the culture of overdoing is ingrained			0
" simply put , physicians are trained to think that the way you take care of people is to " find stuff and to take care of that stuff , " @entity95 says			1
patients are n't exactly helping the issue , either			0
energized by public awareness cancer campaigns , many patients have been empowered to find cancer early through screening and to intervene as soon as possible , @entity95 observes			2
" to raise awareness and to get people to participate in screening , we have to whip up fear ; we must introduce a bit of ' dis - ease ' into the population , " he said			0
" in a way , we have to make them feel as if the world may be a more dangerous place and that they ought to be worried about their future			0
" @entity5 's patient , the one he refused to treat , eventually found another doctor who would treat his prostate cancer			2
" patients will doctor - shop until they get what they want , " @entity5 said			0
it 's an issue many people have difficulty wrapping their heads around : some patients who are diagnosed with cancer do not need to be treated , because that cancer is never going to bother them			1
the problem is that we do n't know who those people are			0
" there is a lot of work and research in this area in trying to better characterize which tumors will matter , " @entity95 said			0
the @entity34 working group made several recommendations for the medical community in addressing cancer overdiagnosis and overtreatment			1
one was a change in the terminology doctors use to talk about cancer , especially when the cells they 've found may not be dangerous			2
" use of the term ' cancer ' should be reserved for describing lesions with a reasonable likelihood of lethal progression if left untreated , " they wrote			2
they also noted that the public should be made aware that overdiagnosis is common in cancer screening			2
doctors know that approximately 10 % of localized lung cancer tumors and 20 % to 30 % of localized breast cancer tumors that are found through screening would never cause harm , @entity5 says			1
" that tumor would just stay there : never grow , never spread			0
" the rate is even higher for prostate cancer at 60 %			1
but is n't screening used to catch some aggressive cancers in people that we would otherwise see too late to treat ? some overdiagnosis is acceptable , @entity5 says			0
" we cure and treat some people who do n't need to be treated			2
and in return , we save some lives			0
" but screening has its own dangers			0
whenever you test a population , you will have some false positives			0
for example , if a woman is told that her mammogram is abnormal , that diagnosis might be straightened out days or weeks later , and she might find out that she does not have cancer			2
the diagnosis will create anxiety and lead to additional unnecessary testing			2
good health is more than absence of physical abnormality ; it 's also a state of mind , experts say			1
" in my experience , it 's not the diagnosis of cancer which really kills people , " said @entity267 , a former oncologist , vice provost for global initiatives and chairman of the @entity270 and @entity271 at the @entity272			2
" it 's the uncertainty			0
" the @entity34 group recommended reducing the frequency of some screening examinations , focusing that screening on high - risk groups ( e.g. screening smokers for lung cancer ) and raising the requirements that would lead to a biopsy or other follow up care			1
" we 've been taught that cancer is a terrible thing and the way to deal with it always is to find it early and cut it out , " @entity5 said			2
" we 're starting to realize that that is not true in all cases			0
" childhood cancer survivors have significant chronic disease			2

@entity34 scientists say the word " cancer " is sometimes *misleading*
not everyone who is diagnosed with cancer should be treated , experts say
unnecessary tests and treatment may account for 10 % to 30 % of health care spending
