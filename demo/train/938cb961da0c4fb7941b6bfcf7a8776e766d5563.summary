it was with some difficulty that @entity2 agreed to extend the ceasefire with @entity4 for another five days wednesday			1
the movement sees a second truce extension as a sign of weakness after 35 days of fighting with @entity4			1
@entity2 has used this war to achieve some tactical and strategic objectives and considers itself the winner in the conflict			2
as such , it believes it can dictate terms			0
@entity2 has seen this war as an opportunity not only to end the blockade of @entity16 , but also to end its political isolation and allow itself to present itself as the face of @entity19 -- on and off the battlefield			1
@entity2 ' public image has suffered since it came to rule in @entity16 in 2007			2
it chose to keep its focus on resistance , rather than governance , leaving that instead to @entity26 president @entity25			0
seven years on , the blockade by @entity4 and @entity28 had left the group in dire financial straits			1
@entity31 reports @entity2 has struggled to pay some 40,000 civil servants and security personnel			0
the @entity35 @entity34 said last month " former de facto government employees , including the security forces , have not been paid salaries regularly since august 2013 and no salaries at all since april 2014			0
" @entity2 had hoped that an april agreement to form a " consensus government " with @entity41 -- which runs the government in the @entity43 -- would resolve the issue			0
when it did not , @entity2 tried to achieve its goals through the conflict with @entity4			1
the already miserable situation in @entity16 meant that its fighters had nothing to lose and mass @entity26 casualties , as well damage to property and infrastructure , hardened their resolve			2
a battle that was launched for humble goals has ended with increased @entity58 and @entity26 sympathy -- and an expansion of @entity2 ' objectives			1
indeed , some @entity19 believe that @entity2 ' aims are more factional than national			2
some members of @entity41 have told me that @entity2 prevented their military wing -- the @entity65 -- fighting during the conflict with @entity4 , placing around 60 members under house arrest			1
@entity2 also hoped that its war with @entity4 would indirectly increase public support for its ally in @entity28 , the now - outlawed @entity71			1
however , @entity2 is unlikely to quell @entity28 anger at the @entity71 -- the movement of ousted president @entity74			2
@entity75 may have received a high - level delegation from @entity2 for peace talks , but it remains hostile to the movement			0
@entity2 ' insistence in the peace negotiations on having an independent seaport and airport is aimed at avoiding pressure from @entity28 , ruled as it now is by a regime that regards @entity2 as an enemy			2
@entity2 has also been at loggerheads with countries such as @entity88 , the @entity89 and @entity90 , which -- like @entity28 -- are looking unfavorably at political islam			1
meanwhile , the group 's decision to back @entity95 rebels against @entity97 's regime saw it fighting @entity4 without the support of @entity99 , @entity100 and @entity101 for the first time			0
the conflict has severely depleted @entity2 ' arsenal , and it will now be compelled to return to @entity106 's orbit to rebuild			0
after two cease - fires and 10 days of negotiations in @entity75 @entity2 still does not seem to have achieved its objectives			0
there has been no breakthrough with @entity4 regarding the re-opening of the border crossings , or ending the blockade			0
and whatever the agreement with @entity4 , the @entity26 will be tasked to control @entity116 and other @entity16 ground crossings with @entity4			1
any money for the reconstruction of @entity16 will also be channeled through the @entity26 , with the conflict thus ensuring the authority takes partial control of @entity16			1
despite this erosion of power , @entity2 has used the conflict to reestablish itself as an important player in the @entity126 , after two years that saw the @entity71 and its allies pushed to the margins			0
@entity16 cease - fire extension appears to hold @entity4 and its neighbors : decades of war is @entity126 peace as far away as ever ?			0

@entity2 and @entity4 agreed wednesday to extend a truce for another five days
@entity26 negotiators demands ' include a *lifting* of @entity4 and @entity28 's blockade on @entity16
but @entity140 says @entity2 ' objectives also include ending its political isolation
he says the group has used the conflict to *reposition* itself as the face of @entity19
