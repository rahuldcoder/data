the @entity2 targeted liberal groups as well as conservatives seeking tax - exempt status , a @entity1 congressman charged on monday after the agency acknowledged the inappropriate practice continued until last month			1
rep. @entity8 said the term " progressives " was included on @entity2 screening lists of applicants for tax - exempt status made available to @entity14 on monday			1
it was the first confirmation that the " @entity19 " or @entity21 lists used criteria targeting liberal groups after an inspector general 's report made public last month said the @entity2 had used words such as " tea party " to determine possible extra scrutiny			1
earlier , the first substantive review of the controversy by the @entity2 showed the agency used multiple lists of inappropriate criteria in assessing tax - exempt applications up until this month , more than a year later than previously revealed			1
@entity31 , the @entity2 acting commissioner , provided no details of what inappropriate criteria were on the lists , but said " there was a wide - ranging set of categories and cases that spanned a broad spectrum			1
" the practice of using bolo lists in considering tax - exempt applications has been suspended , @entity31 told reporters			1
shifting polls contradict key deposition @entity8 's disclosure that progressive groups also were targeted follows a liberal claim that their side also came under extra scrutiny based on political titles or other language in their applications			0
in a statement , the @entity55 @entity54 questioned why the @entity58 inspector general who initially disclosed the @entity2 targeting , @entity60 , focused only on bolo lists that contained conservative labels			1
the inspector general 's report " served as the basis and impetus for a wide range of congressional investigations , and this new information shows that the foundation of those investigations is flawed in a fundamental way , " @entity8 's statement said			0
a spokesperson for @entity60 later responded that the report focused only on @entity21 criteria used to refer cases for extra scrutiny of potential political activity that would make groups ineligible for tax - exempt status			0
conservative groups complained about their applications being delayed for months and even years , receiving demands for inappropriate questioning from the @entity2			2
@entity85 have claimed the controversy amounted to political retribution against enemies of the administration , an accusation denied by the @entity91 and the @entity2			2
in response to @entity8 's statement , @entity93 chairman rep. @entity92 said the inclusion of " progressives " on a bolo list did not prove that liberal groups underwent the same extra scrutiny of conservative groups cited in the inspector general 's report			0
@entity102 poll : did @entity91 order @entity2 targeting ? political firestorm the controversy that became public last month with the release of @entity60 's report ignited a political firestorm in @entity109 while fueling conservative mistrust of president @entity112 's administration			1
use of some lists of conservative labels for further screening stopped in may 2012 when @entity2 officials were first notified of the practice			1
however , @entity31 's review showed that other inappropriate lists continued to be used until as recently as this month by the unit that handles tax - exempt applications			2
@entity31 was informed on june 12 , 2013 , that other bolo lists were still in use			1
he immediately suspended use of any bolo lists by the unit that handles tax - exempt applications , his review said			1
he noted that his investigation , while still incomplete , found no evidence so far of intentional wrongdoing by @entity2 personnel , involvement by anyone outside the @entity2 or that targeting extended into other areas of the agency			1
" several key leaders , including some in the commissioner 's office , failed in multiple capacities to meet their managerial responsibilities at various points during the course of these events , " @entity31 's report said			0
" most notably , there was insufficient action by these leaders to identify , prevent , address , and disclose the problematic situation that materialized with the review of applications for tax exempt status			0
" remember that @entity2 scandal			0
? five @entity2 managers have been replaced , from the previous acting commissioner whom @entity31 succeeded to the head of the unit based in @entity158 that handles tax - exempt applications			1
in addition , @entity31 created an @entity161 to recommend within 60 days " any additional personnel actions necessary to hold accountable those responsible " for the targeting disclosed by the inspector general 's report			0
@entity91 spokesman @entity166 said monday that @entity112 believes @entity31 's report " is an important step in ensuring accountability for any staff that acted inappropriately , identifies the failures in their systems that allowed the misconduct to happen , and takes a forward - looking systemic view at the agency 's management			0
" the @entity91 ordered the review by @entity31 when he started the job on may 22 in the aftermath of @entity60 's audit that found targeting of some conservative groups seeking tax - exempt status			0
@entity31 was given 30 days to complete the review , and the @entity93 has scheduled a hearing for thursday on the report , with @entity31 as the lone witness			0
read @entity2 watchdog 's report series of investigations the targeting scandal and a separate inspector general 's report that documented wasteful spending on @entity2 conferences in past years have led to a series of investigations of the tax collection agency by @entity14 , the @entity201 , the tax administration inspector general 's office and @entity204			2
the @entity2 admitted there was unfair targeting of conservative groups seeking tax - exempt status starting in 2010 , but officials said the action was a bureaucratic shortcut in its @entity158 office rather than an exercise of political bias			1
@entity2 targeting : scandal or snafu ? in his report that disclosed the misconduct , @entity60 said there was no evidence of a political motive			1
however , @entity60 is continuing to investigate the matter , along with the @entity223 and the congressional committees			1
@entity85 argue the controversy is proof that the administration and progressive groups have been trying to clamp down on those who disagree with @entity112 's agenda			0
@entity92 , a @entity55 @entity85 , said monday that the @entity2 " still needs to provide clear answers to the most significant questions -- who started this practice , why was it allowed to continue for so long , and how widespread was it ? " " this culture of political discrimination and intimidation goes far beyond basic management failure and personnel changes alone wo n't fix a broken @entity2 , " @entity92 said in a statement that promised continued investigation			2
as part of his review , @entity31 said 80 groups awaiting @entity2 action on their applications for tax exempt status for more than 120 days could self - register with the agency as long as they certified under penalty of perjury that they would comply with applicable laws and regulations			2
@entity253 : @entity112 administration marked by ' culture of intimidation ' at the heart of the matter is what kind of organization can qualify for tax - exempt status			0
regulations limit such status to groups primarily involved in social welfare activities , while political groups are considered ineligible			0
confusion over defining what constitutes political activity versus social welfare activity contributed to the targeting by the @entity2 , @entity31 said			2
an @entity2 statement on monday said the " safe - harbor " option for self - certification would apply to groups that " certify they devote 60 % or more of both their spending and time on activities that promote social welfare			2
" " at the same time , they must certify that political campaign intervention involves 40 % or less of both their spending and time , " the statement said			0
applicants meeting those thresholds would get approval within two weeks of seeking self - certification , it said			0
@entity31 said the @entity2 would continue checking on tax - exempt groups to ensure they were following the law			2
