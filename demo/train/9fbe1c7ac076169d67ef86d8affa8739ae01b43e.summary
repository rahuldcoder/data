-- a lawmaker 's remarks at a roast for sheriff @entity4 made audience members chuckle and applaud			1
but critics of the controversial @entity8 sheriff say they are n't laughing			1
comments made by state rep. @entity10 , they say , were racist jokes that used @entity12 as the punchline			1
the tumult comes after the @entity15 , a civil rights organization that has criticized @entity4 in the past , posted audio recordings from the recent roast on its website			1
" @entity4 is the kind of guy that you got ta love , as long as you have papers , " @entity10 quips in the recording			1
" going out with @entity4 is always an adventure , " he continues , " because usually when we walk into a restaurant , most of the waitstaff and cooks dive out the back window , and when they do n't , i never know what the hell 's in my food			2
" it 's comments like that , the law center claims , that show why conservatives have a hard time connecting with @entity12			1
" there is a fundamental lack of respect , " the center said			0
@entity10 declined @entity0 's interview request			2
but in a written statement , he called the @entity15 's post a personal attack			0
" the jokes i made at the sheriff @entity51 , at his invitation , were satirical comedy			1
the jokes were not directed at minority group members but at the target of the roast -- sheriff @entity4			1
the jokes were jabs against the sheriff based upon allegations of his department 's engaging in racial profiling , " @entity10 said			1
" the @entity15 edited out selected portions of a much longer roast on many topics not related to racial profiling			0
the humor was typical of roasts and had i made the same jokes against @entity73 at their annual dinner , i suspect that they would have been laughing as much as this audience laughed			0
likewise , had these jokes been made on a tv comedy or variety show , there would also be no controversy			2
" @entity10 , a @entity82 , was a major supporter of @entity8 's just - vetoed religious freedom bill and also supported its 2010 law cracking down on illegal immigration			2
the clip posted online included about six minutes excerpted from remarks that lasted around 20 minutes at the roast			2
in his roast , @entity10 also joked about @entity4 's age and other topics , including singer @entity93 's legal problems			1
@entity4 , who calls himself @entity95 's toughest sheriff , told @entity0 there 's no basis for allegations that @entity10 is racist			1
" it was a roast			0
he 's not a racist			0
he 's very funny , " @entity4 said			2
" so , he made these comments , i ca n't speak whether he went too far			0
" the sheriff accused people criticizing the roast of having a double standard			0
" everybody 's talking about him			0
what about all the activists and the civil rights ( groups ) that called me @entity111 and @entity112 ? for four years , they 've been doing that , on street corners and everywhere else , " he said			1
" why is n't there an uproar about going after me , calling me every name in the book ? why are they worried about just some roast ? " last year , a federal court in @entity123 ruled that @entity4 's handling of people of @entity127 descent was not tough enforcement of immigration laws but instead amounted to racial and ethnic profiling			1
the judge later ordered a federal monitor to keep tabs on @entity4 's office and make sure officers were n't racially profiling anymore			2
the monitor was also a subject of jokes during @entity10 's roast			1
i 'm not the federal monitor , " he said			0
" how many @entity127 did you pull over on the way over here , @entity4 , huh ? " @entity4 's tough , headline - grabbing punishments have earned him diehard supporters and fiery opponents			0
he 's issued pink underwear to the men detained in the county 's jails and said he is saving taxpayers money by removing salt and pepper from prison meals			0
in january , @entity4 said inmates who allegedly defaced @entity95 flags placed in their jail cells would be punished with a diet of bread and water			0
@entity0 's @entity162 , @entity163 , @entity164 , @entity165 and @entity166 contributed to this report .			0
