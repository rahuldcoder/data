-- on wednesday , july 23 , the @entity1 executed @entity2 in the fourth visibly bungled execution this year			1
the execution began at 1:52 p.m. according to eyewitness @entity5 , " @entity2 was unconscious by 1:57 p.m. at about 2:05 , he started gasping			0
" he continued to gasp for over 90 minutes			0
afterward , eyewitness @entity6 reported , " @entity7 is dead , but it took him two hours to die			1
to watch a man lay there for an hour and 40 minutes gulping air , i can liken it to , if you catch a fish and throw it on the shore , the way the fish opens and closes its mouth			0
" @entity5 counted more than 640 gasps			0
@entity1 engaged in a failed experiment			1
its new execution protocol called for administration of two drugs , midazolam and hydromorphone			0
the only other time this drug combination had been used was the prolonged and similarly disturbing @entity29 execution of @entity30 , who took 24 minutes to die and struggled for air for 10 to 13 minutes			2
eyewitness @entity32 reported that @entity33 " gasped deeply			0
it was kind of a rattling , guttural sound			0
there was kind of a snorting through his nose			0
a couple of times , he definitely appeared to be choking			0
" faced with these well - documented problems , @entity1 adopted @entity29 's procedure but increased the amount of each drug ( from 10 milligrams to 50 milligrams for midazolam and from 40mg to 50mg for hydromorphone )			1
the state refused to reveal , however , its process for selecting the new doses or whether it conducted due diligence to determine that its protocol would be more effective			2
notwithstanding the changes @entity1 made to the drug formula , @entity2 's execution went even worse than @entity33 's			1
despite requests from @entity2 's lawyers , @entity1 also refused to reveal the source of its drugs -- including the manufacturer , lot number and expiration date -- and the qualifications of its execution team members			2
nothing about this information would compromise the identity of those participating in executions , but it would allow the courts and the public to analyze whether the execution procedures will work as intended and bring about death in a way that meets the requirements of the @entity79			1
@entity80 : are death penalty delays ' cruel and unusual ' ? four men -- @entity83 , @entity33 , @entity84 and @entity2 -- have been subjected to bungled executions this year			1
although the drugs , doses and other details of the procedures differed in each execution , the commonality between them is that the departments of corrections used experimental drug combinations and shielded crucial aspects of their practices in secrecy			2
even in the aftermath of the executions , the lack of transparency continues			2
while governors in both @entity105 and @entity1 have called for reviews of the problematic executions , no outside authorities have been brought in to conduct the investigations			1
@entity110 investigations are insufficient to the task			0
departments of corrections can not be allowed to provide pat explanations that leave central questions unanswered , minimize errors and hide relevant information about what went wrong			2
instead , there must be independent investigations of each execution that goes awry and thorough , public reporting of the results			0
without truly independent investigations , it will be impossible to make meaningful conclusions about what went wrong or to determine if changes can be made to ensure that the same errors do not happen again			0
chemical mix and human error lead to controversial executions the botched executions in @entity1 , @entity29 and @entity105 show us that when states are allowed to devise novel , untested execution protocols without judicial scrutiny or public oversight , the resulting procedures are unreliable			1
and when the unreliable procedures are implemented , the consequences are gruesome and horrific			0
states can not be allowed to continue carrying out death sentences without judicial review of their execution procedures			1
the courts must require departments of corrections to disclose key aspects of these procedures , particularly with respect to the provenance of the drugs used and the qualifications of the execution personnel			1
without this oversight , botched executions will become the new norm			1
no additional executions should proceed until the states act with transparency , and the courts scrutinize execution procedures to ensure that they comport with the @entity164 @entity163			1
join us on @entity167 / @entity166 .			0

four men have been subjected to botched executions this year , authors say
in @entity1 , it took @entity173 two hours to die
authors say states veil their procedures in secrecy , contributing to the problem
states must disclose much more information and courts should review process , they say
