-- @entity2 rep. @entity1 formally announced her candidacy for the 2012 @entity5 presidential nomination monday during an appearance in @entity7 , @entity8 -- the city where she was born			1
@entity1 , a 55 - year - old @entity10 favorite currently serving her third term in the @entity12 , told a crowd of supporters that @entity16 's presidency has been a failure			1
she promised to lead a new conservative revolution characterized by smaller government and a lower federal debt			0
" make no mistake about it : president @entity16 is a one - term president , " @entity1 declared			1
" together we can rein in all the corruption and waste that has become @entity26 and instead leave a better @entity27 for future generations			0
" @entity1 blasted @entity16 's controversial 2009 economic stimulus plan , telling the crowd that " spending our way out of this recession has n't worked			1
" echoing @entity36 's famous refrain , the congresswoman asserted that " more than ever , @entity26 is the problem			0
" " the real solutions will come from our businesses , our communities , our schools and the most basic and powerful unit of all -- our families , " she proclaimed			0
while making a direct appeal to the @entity10 's deficit hardliners , @entity1 also made a pitch to religious conservatives , praising the country 's past military victories in part by citing a line from the @entity52 : " greater love hath no man than this , but that he lay down his life for his friend			1
" @entity16 campaign spokesman @entity58 dismissed @entity1 's claim she could lead a new economic recovery , arguing that " her policies would erode the path to prosperity for middle class families			1
" most political analysts consider @entity1 's candidacy for the @entity5 nomination a long shot at best , as front - runner @entity69 cranks up a formidable campaign operation and fundraising machine			1
few @entity12 members have proven to be nationally viable candidates in the past			0
on sunday , @entity76 's @entity75 asked @entity1 if she 's a " flake " -- a question the congresswoman said she found insulting			1
regardless , @entity1 appears to have considerable appeal among @entity5 in @entity8 , which will host the nation 's first caucuses next winter			1
she finished a statistically insignificant one point behind @entity69 in a @entity8 poll released saturday night			1
@entity69 , a former @entity85 governor and familiar face from his 2008 bid , was favored by 23 % of the likely @entity89 caucus - goers , while @entity1 was favored by 22 % of respondents			1
former @entity92 ceo @entity91 -- like @entity1 , a @entity10 favorite -- received 10 % , while former house speaker @entity93 and rep. @entity94 of @entity95 each got 7 %			1
@entity1 , according to a number of observers , is believed to be banking on heavy support among @entity8 's influential evangelical voters to give her a breakthrough victory in @entity8 and establish her as the main @entity5 alternative to @entity69 , who is still struggling to overcome skepticism among conservatives			1
to help accomplish that task , @entity1 has assembled a team of veteran political operatives			2
among others , she hired @entity109 , who directed @entity36 's landslide re-election bid in 1984 and managed former @entity113 gov. @entity112 's 2008 effort , to run her operation			0
she has also brought in top - flight @entity5 talent like pollster @entity117 , who was working with @entity119 gov. @entity118 before @entity120 decided not to seek the nomination			0
the congresswoman has also brought on board message maven @entity123 , who worked for president @entity125 and for sen. @entity127 's 2008 campaign			0
@entity123 coached @entity127 running mate @entity128 before her high - stakes vice-presidential debate			0
also aiding @entity1 are veteran consultant @entity130 , who has deep ties to the conservative movement ; former @entity127 campaign web guru @entity133 ; and @entity135 , a fundraiser for @entity125 's 2004 campaign and former @entity140 mayor @entity139 's 2008 bid			2
asked about the steep challenge ahead , @entity1 boasted sunday that she has a " titanium spine for doing what we need to do			2
" she also stressed her sincerity -- a characteristic supporters hope will allow the congresswoman to draw a stark contrast with @entity69 , who is accused of being a politically opportunistic flip - flopper on abortion and other key issues			1
" what people know about me is i do what i say and i say what i mean , " @entity1 said on @entity76			2
" i think people recognize i 'm very sincere in what i say			0
" @entity1 , who backs deep spending cuts to balance the federal budget , became defensive when asked sunday about a @entity161 report on federal money that benefited her family -- including nearly $ 30,000 for a counseling clinic operated by her husband and almost $ 260,000 for a family farm			1
the money did n't directly benefit her family , she explained , saying the $ 30,000 was for training employees , and the farm that got the $ 260,000 was owned by her father - in - law , so she and her husband did n't get any of it			0
asked about another hot - button issue -- same - sex marriage -- @entity1 said she supported both the right of states to pass laws on the matter and the superseding authority of a federal constitutional amendment on the issue			1
@entity1 said @entity140 's state legislature and governor have the right under the @entity185 to legalize gay marriage , which they did friday night and early saturday			2
but , @entity1 added , she also backs a federal constitutional amendment that would define marriage as between a man and a woman			2
in the end , @entity1 said , it would be better to settle the matter with citizens voting on a constitutional amendment rather than @entity198 justices issuing a decision			2
asked on @entity201 's " @entity200 " whether she believes homosexuality is a choice , @entity1 said it was up to individuals to make their own decision and that she was n't judging anyone on the issue			2
she described herself as a @entity209 who gets guidance in her life and political career through prayer			0
she also challenged the widespread assertion -- backed by the @entity12 , treasury secretary @entity216 and a host of economic analysts -- that a failure to raise the current $ 14.3 trillion federal debt ceiling by august 2 would have potentially dangerous economic consequences			0
" it is scare tactics , " @entity1 said , adding that the government takes in plenty of money to pay the interest it owes on federal debt and avoid default			0
in that case , she conceded , other spending such as funding for the military would have to be cut			0
@entity0 's @entity234 , @entity235 , and @entity236 contributed to this report			0
