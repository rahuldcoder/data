while secretary of state , @entity2 was skeptical of early plans to trade @entity6 prisoners for @entity8 captive @entity7 , former officials involved in the process told @entity9 on tuesday			1
@entity10 pushed for a much tougher deal than the one with @entity12 that secured the @entity16 sergeant 's release in exchange for five terror detainees held at @entity19 , @entity20 , they said			1
she left office in 2013 , but the former officials said they did n't know whether @entity10 would have signed off on the swap that culminated this past weekend with @entity7 climbing aboard a military helicopter			1
@entity10 offered a measured defense of it in an appearance in @entity29 on monday			1
but she but did not answer when asked directly if she would have approved , if still serving as @entity8 's top diplomat			0
" this young man , whatever the circumstances , was an @entity8 citizen -- is an @entity8 citizen -- was serving in our military , " @entity10 said			1
" the idea that you really care for your own citizens and particularly those in uniform , i think is a very noble one			0
" @entity7 was the only remaining @entity8 soldier captured during the conflicts in @entity46 and @entity47			0
@entity10 's thinking on the matter is in play as she considers whether to run for president in 2016			1
@entity53 have taken aim at president @entity56 's foreign policy , and some conservatives complain that negotiating with the @entity6 illustrates weak leadership that could hurt @entity8 later on			1
@entity56 has defended his decision , saying , " we do n't leave men and women in uniform behind			0
" @entity7 , 28 , was captured by the @entity6 in @entity47 in june 2009 , and was apparently moved between that country and @entity65 at that time			2
@entity10 did not trust the @entity66 believed to have held him , the former officials said , and she was skeptical that the trade would lead to peace with the @entity6			1
she reportedly was also concerned about the ability to enforce any deal			0
the @entity66 has ties to @entity73 and the @entity6 , and the @entity8 has designated it a foreign - based terror organization			1
republicans and @entity76 in @entity77 had also raised serious concerns more than two years ago with the @entity56 administration about the possibility of such a swap , and inquired about conditions			0
key members from both parties wrote @entity10 about their concern , and @entity87 chairman @entity86 said they received a " comprehensive response " that included " security assurances and a promise of consultation with the @entity77			2
" @entity86 and @entity93 speaker @entity92 said this week they could recall no further consultations about the matter with the administration until last saturday			0
a framework for negotiations approved by @entity10 , however , had tougher measures aiming to ensure the detainees would not return to the battlefield , including releasing the prisoners in two phases			1
the former officials said that under her plan , the first three would be released and then the remaining two would be freed 60 days later when they released @entity7			0
she also wanted the @entity12 to impose stricter restrictions and monitoring once they were in that nation 's custody , the officials said			0
under the agreement reached with the @entity56 administration , the five detainees were transferred to @entity12 where they can live freely but will be monitored for a year			0
@entity8 troops are due to wrap up combat operations in @entity47 at year 's end with most forces leaving the country			0
while the deal resulting in @entity7 's release resulted from indirect talks mediated by @entity12 , administration officials led by @entity124 , @entity10 's special envoy for @entity47 and @entity65 , met several times with @entity6 leaders in 2011 and 2012 to discuss the issue			1
the meetings occurred before the @entity6 broke off talks			2
@entity10 wanted the prisoner swap to be one of a series confidence - building measures , which also included the opening of a @entity6 office in @entity12 's capital , @entity135 , and a @entity6 renunciation of terrorism , as part of larger peace efforts between the @entity6 and @entity47			1
she also pushed @entity65 to use its influence with the @entity6 to engage in the reconciliation talks to end the war , as the @entity8 prepared to wind down in @entity47			2
" you do n't make peace with your friends , " she told @entity77 in october 2011			0
" there first would have to be a demonstrated willingness on the @entity6 's part to negotiate and to meet the conditions already laid out for joining negotiations			2
" the @entity6 office opened in june 2013 , but closed the same day when the group violated the terms by raising their flag , effectively killing talks for six months			1
ultimately , the @entity56 administration agreed to release all of the prisoners at once and , because the @entity6 said it would only negotiate over the prisoner exchange , abandoned its efforts at wider reconciliation when the talks resumed earlier this year			1
who was swapped for @entity7 ? @entity10 on monday said the ultimate outcome of the exchange is unknown right now			2
" i think we have a long way to go before we really know how this is going to play out , " @entity10 said			2
" you do n't want to see these five prisoners go back to combat			0
there 's a lot that you do n't want to have happen			0
" but she added , " you also do n't want an @entity8 citizen , if you can avoid it , especially a solider , to die in captivity			0
