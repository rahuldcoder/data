-- @entity1 is getting married and this seems to be a matter of intense interest to women around the world			1
why do we care ? to begin , there is the incredible proliferation of mass media , the huge amount of coverage on celebrities and the self - exposure stars are willing to endure -- even prefer -- these days			0
" stars " have changed from glamorous , unfathomables , to " friends " we follow on @entity24 , in intimate , unguarded photos in entertainment magazines ( which we do n't even have to buy ; the headlines and pictures capture us in our doctors ' offices and at the check out counter )			2
we turn on the tv talk shows and learn more than we should as heartbroken or apologetic celebrity guests share details of their romantic misadventures			0
women like @entity1 become girlfriends , or friends of friends , who we listen to , judge , identify with and commiserate with			1
the wall separating us from stardom has been replaced by a penetrable surface , with celebrities just one tweet or book group away			0
she is no longer @entity1 , the star ; she is @entity1 , a friend once removed and we talk about her among friends as if she were one of us			1
news : @entity1 engaged to actor @entity43 she is not , though , so why do we feel so strongly about what happens to a movie star who has no apparent connection to our lives ? two reasons			1
first , we know enough about her travail to identity with her and project ourselves into her situation			2
here is a woman , who , like many of us , has wanted someone very badly , made mutual vows of fidelity and loyalty , and had that person leave for another lover -- in this case , an exceptionally talented and gorgeous woman , who now lays claim to everything she ( or we ) ever wanted			0
there are few women who have n't lost someone they loved -- and they immediately take up her cause , and her feelings , as their own			2
secondly , we follow her life because in a strange way , it comforts us			0
if a man could be unfaithful to such a lovely , successful and nice woman , we can know that perhaps we were n't left because we were n't pretty enough or sexy enough or witty enough , but because some men just fall in love with someone else			0
we can see that regardless of why our own mate left , there was nothing about it that should wipe out our self - esteem and there was n't necessarily anything we could have done that would have saved our relationship			0
peering into various celebrity real melodramas rather perversely cheers us up ! in 2008 , millions of women were riveted to the divorce trial of @entity88 , whose husband , @entity89 , betrayed her with a teenage employee			0
well , we thought , if a man could do that to @entity88 , of course we should n't feel that a husband or boyfriend left us for not being pretty enough or sexy enough			0
look what happened to one of the most gloriously gorgeous women on @entity100 ! @entity1 's men then there is an additional twist in @entity1 's story that reassures us			1
her failed marriage says to us that someone even more glorious than ourselves can be left , but her engagement tells us that there can be a @entity110 story at the end of the road : a mate who truly loves us , who wants to create a family , who will deliver security and unconditional love at last			1
sure , it may last as long as the next headline , but we deeply hope love stays the course for her , because we want to believe that our own dreams will result in triumph over disappointment			1
this is why we care in a seemingly unreasonable way about what happens to @entity1			1
nice girls might not finish last			0
sure , we care about @entity1 , but we follow her life , and the life of other celebrities , mostly because they are now in our " friendship circle , " however illusory this perception is			1
@entity1 's " fairy tale ending " is a stand - in for the fairly tale ending we want for ourselves			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity139 .			2

@entity139 : many are interested that @entity1 is engaged . why ?
she says after years of tabloid *scrutiny* of her marital travail , many women relate to her
she says that @entity1 is finding love lets other *scorned* women feel they can find it , too
@entity139 : we follow her story , delight in her triumph because it gives hope for our own
