-- lotus driver @entity1 stormed to a red - hot @entity3 victory on sunday , but the ice - cool @entity4 refused to get carried away following his first @entity6 win in over three years			1
championship leader @entity7 and archrival @entity8 were both vying for points in the race for the drivers ' title , but it was the 2007 world champion @entity1 who finally delivered the grand prix win his 2012 form had threatened			1
the former @entity18 driver , who left the sport in 2009 and spent time in @entity20 and rally before returning to @entity6 with @entity22 at the start of this season , admitted it was satisfying to prove he could still cut it at the front of the grid			2
" to be honest it 's just another win on the list for me , " the 33 - year - old told the sport 's official website following the 19th win of his career and his first since the @entity34			1
latest f1 standings after @entity3 @entity1 has quickly readjusted to life in the cockpit			1
he sits third in the drivers ' championship behind @entity44 's @entity43 of @entity18 having registered six podium finishes prior to his triumph at the @entity47			1
@entity1 made his @entity6 debut in 2001 and is a veteran of 154 races starts			2
despite his wealth of experience , the one - time @entity52 driver admitted it was good to silence those who questioned whether his best days were behind him			2
" it 's great of course , because it 's been a few years , but the wins prior to this one were very similar , " he continued			0
" we did n't have the best car , but we fought and still won			0
" it 's great to win now , so people will stop asking me if i can win or not , and at least it makes it a bit clearer ! " however @entity1 knows a poor performance at the inaugural @entity69 @entity3 on november 17 will render his exploits in @entity71 meaningless in the eyes of his critics			1
" i never cared really what people think , " he said			0
" if i do n't finish the next race , then they 'll think that i 'm as bad as that race			0
" i 'll just do my thing , and if i 'm happy with what i 'm doing and it 's the best it can be for the team , then that 's that			0
so i really do n't care if people are thinking differently of me now , than what they did three hours before the race			0
