-- as the source of the @entity6 , the site of @entity9 's famous @entity8 pilgrimage and home to @entity11 , the meditation retreat made famous by @entity12 , the @entity3 's northern @entity2 state justifies its title of " @entity14			1
" but environmentalists are warning that rampant development in the @entity18 state is tempting fate			1
with roads built on an ad hoc basis , new hotel developments built on river banks and hydro dams proposed in the region 's steep valleys , environmentalists say the floods and mudslides that have claimed more than 1,000 lives in the past week were an ecological catastrophe waiting to happen			1
" you 've heard of homicide , well this is ecocide , " @entity32 of the @entity33 told @entity0			2
" the hills have been shorn of the forest cover , there 's extensive mining taking place in this region and on top of that the roads that are being constructed are haphazard			2
" and the hydro projects coming are phenomenal -- 70 hydro projects back to back			1
obviously there are tunnels being built , hills being blasted and everything goes topsy - turvy			0
" we are playing with nature but at the same time blaming nature			0
" he said while a massive national road - building program had been well received by @entity3 's state governments , routes had been planned through increasingly remote areas without adequate drainage , exacerbating the problems of coping with massive run - off from the region 's monsoon rains			1
a real estate boom in the region has also resulted in new developments going ahead without adequate planning permission			0
" it 's a classical model of disaster , " he said			0
" if you want to see globally what can happen in regions like the @entity72 or the @entity73 or elsewhere you only have to take a look at @entity2			1
" @entity75 of the @entity3 advocacy group the @entity76 said that despite state government denials , most experts were of the view that unregulated development and unregulated tourism is responsible for the scale of the disaster			1
" development is important but we need to keep in mind the very delicate eco-system that you 're working within , " he said			1
" the @entity18 are the biggest mountain range in the world but they are also extremely fragile			1
" you need to keep that in mind when putting disaster management plans in place			0
" he said his organization recommended a certain amount of flow necessary to keep rivers in the region at a safe level , but that dam projects and river diversions for roads had backed up with flood waters from torrential rains			2
" the drainage in many areas is half - baked , " he told @entity0			0
@entity2 's chief minister @entity110 told the @entity112 newspaper that the floods had set back the state by at least three years in terms of development			1
" my people are going to suffer because tourism is going to be affected			0
we have to put the infrastructure back on the rails			0
i have written to the prime minister that preliminary reports suggest there is loss of rs 3,000 crore ( us $ 500 million )			0
this tragedy has broken our economy , " he said			0
he said that a balance needed to be struck between the environment and development , adding that he did not want migration away from @entity2			1
" seventy percent of my state is forest cover			2
( if ) i am preserving my forests for the nation then why do n't you give me compensation ? let the country compensate us			0
" he denied that the disaster was man - made and a result of the indiscriminate construction of hotels and houses			2
" this is a very childish argument -- that cloudbursts , earthquakes and tsunamis are caused by human factors			0
in the history of hundreds of years of @entity153 ( a region of the state ) , no such incident has taken place			2
in a @entity18 state , this catastrophe has come about in 37,000 square miles of area			1
this cloudburst , 330 millimetres of rain , can not be anticipated			0

environmentalists blame rampant development for high death toll in @entity2
they blame hydro projects and ad hoc road building for exacerbating the problem
massive @entity9 pilgrimages every year strain *resources* in the @entity18 state
@entity2 is home to @entity11 , the meditation retreat made famous by @entity12
