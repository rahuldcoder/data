@entity0 , @entity1 -- a @entity4 commander expressed skepticism that one soldier carried out a massacre last week that left 16 @entity1 civilians dead , and anger that the suspect subsequently was flown out of @entity1			1
" we do n't think that one @entity14 was involved , " the @entity4 official told @entity2 , refusing to give his name or be otherwise identified			1
" the foreigners and the puppet regime ( in @entity1 ) are blind to the truth of what happened here			2
" but if this was the act of one soldier , we want this soldier to be prosecuted in @entity1 , and according to @entity22 law			2
the @entity1 should prosecute him			2
" stunned friends recall suspect 's good deeds the commander also explained that the @entity22 fundamentalist group had halted talks with @entity14 officials			2
it had set up an office in @entity33 on january 3 to reach " an understanding with the international community " and discuss specific issues with @entity14 officials			2
in a statement thursday , the @entity4 said work from their @entity33 office was being suspended , a decision made due to what the group called @entity14 officials ' " alternating and ever - changing position			1
" preliminary talks had already begun over the exchange of prisoners , the @entity4 said			2
the @entity4 commander said the burning of @entity50 in february by @entity14 troops and issues surrounding the @entity14 possibly transferring five @entity4 members from the @entity14 prison facility in @entity55 to @entity33 were the main reasons for the decision			1
" the peace talks with the @entity14 were limited to discuss the prisoner deal			2
and those promises were not kept by the @entity14 , " he said			2
the @entity4 official had harsh words for the @entity14 regarding the march 11 rampage in two villages in the district of @entity67 in @entity69 province , though he did not tie that directly with the group 's decision to suspend talks			1
a resident of one of the villages , @entity74 , described to @entity2 how what he and some others claimed were multiple attackers had come into a home before dawn that morning , asked his uncle where the @entity4 were and then shot him dead			1
" finally , they came to this room and martyred all the children , " @entity74 said from the home , claiming a 2 - month - old child was among the nine children killed			0
later , he said some of the dead were piled in a room and set on fire			0
@entity14 officials have said that one man , @entity95 staff sgt. @entity94 , left his outpost and singlehandedly carried out the massacre in two villages			1
he is currently at the @entity14 military prison at @entity100 , @entity101 , pending trial , having flown back to the @entity14 last week			2
the incident , as well as the fact the suspect is n't set to be tried in @entity1 where the crime occurred , has infuriated many @entity1 and heightened tensions between that nation and the @entity14			1
after the shooting spree , @entity1 president @entity109 said that relations between the two countries were at the " end of the rope			1
" the incident came weeks after @entity14 troops burned @entity50 at a coalition base in @entity1 , sparking outrage and fierce protests across the central @entity120 nation			1
yet @entity1 's ambassador to the @entity14 insisted sunday that his nation trusts the @entity14 investigation into the rampage			1
" we do trust the @entity14 and we do know how important this relationship is , and we are working as a partner to resolve all the issues as a partner , " ambassador @entity125 told @entity2 's " @entity131 " on sunday			2
@entity125 said both the shooting rampage and @entity134 burning are tragic , but he acknowledged they come after more than 10 years of a @entity14 presence in his country that has claimed the lives of more than 1,700 @entity14 troops , according to the official @entity14 military count			1
" we do understand sacrifices that our allies , especially our main allies , the @entity14 -- that they have suffered quite a lot , those men in uniform , those women in uniform , " @entity125 said			0
" those are the things that we are grateful ( for ) and we are appreciating that			0
" @entity14 defense secretary @entity151 promised @entity109 a full investigation and said the @entity14 will bring the shooter to justice			0
" he accepted that and hoped that it could be a transparent process so that the @entity1 people would see that the @entity14 is indeed going to not only prosecute this individual but ensure he 's held accountable , " @entity151 said after meeting @entity109 on wednesday			1
" i also indicated to him that we take these kinds of incidents seriously			0
we need to look at just exactly was involved here that caused this terrible crime , " @entity151 said			0
" was it related to combat stress ? other factors ? we need to pay attention to those so it wo n't happen again			0
" the shooting prompted @entity109 to demand that foreign troops pull back from their outposts in @entity1 villages and confine themselves to military bases			1
in his meeting with @entity151 , @entity109 also demanded that the transfer of security responsibilities from @entity178 to @entity0 be accelerated			0
family friends who knew @entity180 , the shooting spree suspect , growing up in the @entity182 suburb of @entity183 , @entity184 , described him as " quiet " and " very nice			1
" the @entity95 said that he enlisted in the military two months after the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks			0
@entity180 went on to serve four combat tours , the last one to @entity1 beginning in january			1
and in between them , he settled down with his wife and their two young children near @entity191 outside @entity192 , @entity178			0
the family owned a townhouse in a modest , middle - class neighborhood in @entity196 , about 30 minutes from the base , before purchasing a house in 2006 for $ 280,000 near @entity199 , according to realty records			0
@entity201 , whose @entity196 townhouse shared a wall with that of the @entity180 family , on sunday described his former neighbor as " a really good guy ( who ) just wanted to serve			0
" " i know he just wanted to go back and serve overseas , that was his goal , " @entity201 recalled from their conversations , while noting the two had n't spoken in about five years			0
@entity213 , president of the @entity214 , said sunday that -- after the @entity180 family moved to @entity199 -- there were occasionally renters in the residence			0
but several years ago , their townhouse was foreclosed upon , according to @entity213 and @entity201			0
the @entity180 also did n't pay homeowners association fees for " at least three or four years , " said @entity213			1
" we do n't know what happened , " @entity213 said of the @entity180 and their @entity196 property , which sunday had a notice that read " do not occupy " on its front door			1
one of @entity180 ' lawyers , @entity229 , said upon arriving at the @entity231 , @entity232 , airport -- where he 'd come so he can drive to meet with his client -- that all the reports surrounding @entity180 have been a " shock " to those who know him as a " very mild mannered person and a great person			0
" @entity241 added that the entire situation was unique and challenging			0
" you could n't imagine a more difficult case , i do n't think , " the lawyer said			1
" this case has political ramifications , it has legal ramifications , it has social ramifications			0
" @entity2 's @entity249 in @entity0 , @entity1 , and @entity250 in @entity196 , @entity178 , contributed to this report .			0
