-- @entity2 opposition groups said saturday that they have formed a breakaway government , but many details were yet to emerge			1
the @entity5 , which organizes and documents protests against the @entity2 regime , said 188 seats have so far been assigned to the council , but it may be 24 hours before the announcement of a presidential body			1
groups including the @entity14 of @entity2 , the @entity15 , the @entity16 and the @entity17 have all joined the @entity5 in the opposition government , the @entity5 said saturday			1
the groups are trying to create a @entity20 aimed at toppling the regime of president @entity22			2
@entity2 has been locked in a violent months - long uprising that has seen security forces clash with anti-government protesters calling for free elections and the end of @entity22 's rule			2
activists said at least eight people died in protests and random shootings on saturday , a day after the government said 13 security forces and three civilians died in clashes and an opposition group said 23 people , mostly civilians , died in the fighting			1
activists also said women marched near the presidential palace in @entity43 on saturday , demanding the fall of the regime , the release of detainees and the lifting of blockades throughout the country			2
@entity0 is unable to independently confirm the claims			0
@entity52 , who has characterized the protesters as " armed gangs , " has insisted his security forces are battling terrorists intent on targeting civilians and fomenting unrest			0
the @entity59 , the @entity60 and a number of @entity63 countries have called an @entity22 to end the crackdown and step down			2
tensions between the @entity59 and @entity2 escalated after the @entity2 ambassador to the @entity59 was called friday to the @entity68 over an attempted attack a day earlier in @entity43 on @entity59 ambassador @entity70 , spokeswoman @entity65 told reporters			1
" the ambassador was reminded that ambassador @entity70 is the personal representative of the president , and an attack on @entity76 is an attack on the @entity59 , " @entity65 said			1
about 100 pro-government protesters tried to storm a meeting between @entity76 and opposition leader @entity80 , trapping @entity76 and others for more than an hour			0
later , his convoy was attacked			0
the @entity22 regime had earlier accused @entity85 of inciting " armed groups " into violence against its security forces			0
@entity65 said ambassador @entity89 was asked to compensate the @entity59 for damage to the vehicles			1
in a @entity93 post friday , @entity70 said he respected " peaceful protest " -- including by pro-government factions to express their opposition to him and @entity59 policy -- but insisted that thursday 's incident was " not peaceful			1
" he described demonstrators wielding iron bars ; throwing tomatoes , eggs and concrete blocks ; attacking embassy vehicles ; and trying to break into @entity106 's office			0
" @entity59 understand that we are seeing the ugly side of the @entity2 regime , which uses brutal force , repression and intimidation to stay in power , " @entity70 wrote			1
" we deeply feel for the @entity2 families that are enduring the violence , killings and torture and pain			2
we hope that @entity2 find solutions to the crisis soon , but we strongly doubt that the regime 's terrorizing the population will end the crisis			2
" @entity2 state - run media , citing the @entity125 , reported friday that " necessary measures " had been taken to protect @entity76			0
taking a page from the success of @entity133 's @entity132 , @entity2 opposition groups meeting in @entity129 worked together to bring the various groups under one opposition umbrella			1
among those expected to be represented by the @entity20 are the @entity14 , the @entity137 and the @entity138 of the @entity139 , the @entity5 said			0
the @entity5 does not identify its membership out of a fear of reprisals by @entity22 's security forces			0
@entity0 can not independently verify the claims of the group because the @entity2 government has denied international journalists access to the country			1
the meeting concluded the same day news broke that prominent anti-government activist @entity151 was detained friday by @entity2 security forces at the @entity43 airport			0
@entity156 was detained as she was preparing to depart the capital and taken to a military security building , the @entity155 - based @entity154 said in a statement			0
the opposition group , which documents @entity2 's anti-government movement , did not say how it confirmed her detention			1
@entity156 was previously detained by @entity2 forces on march 4 and released on march 21 , the group said			0
@entity0 's @entity167 , @entity168 and @entity169 contributed to this report .			0
