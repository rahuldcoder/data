-- @entity2 's @entity1 has insisted he is not a " bad boy " on the eve of his latest return to @entity5 , where he lasted just a season after falling out with then coach @entity7			1
the @entity10 striker , whose goal and assist in the first leg mean that @entity2 head into wednesday 's @entity15 quarterfinal level on aggregate ( 2 - 2 ) , suffered a disappointing spell with the four - time @entity19 champions between 2009 - 2010			1
following a couple of years in @entity21 with @entity22 , the 31 - year - old has now settled in @entity24 , where he tops the @entity26 scoring charts -- his 26 goals from 28 games nine better than his nearest rival			0
" i think people have this image of me , " @entity1 told @entity0 in an exclusive interview			2
" it 's enough that someone in a newspaper says i have a bad character and then everybody jumps on this train			2
if people judge me like that , it 's fine by me , because this is part of the game			0
" but when you get to know me , you will have a different opinion			0
like when i came here , everybody said ' bad boy ' because everybody thinks i am that -- i am not			1
" the former @entity52 , @entity53 and @entity54 player 's career has been dogged by controversy and outspoken comments , even if his time at @entity2 has been largely devoid of incident so far			2
however a quick look at some of the flashpoints that have peppered @entity1 's career -- breaking a rib during a fight with @entity22 teammate @entity65 , threatening to break the legs of @entity67 , another so - called colleague , and being sent home from a crunch @entity10 qualifier for ignoring a curfew -- suggests that with the talent , comes some baggage			1
" never judge a person if you do n't know him , " said @entity1 , who was raised in @entity74 after his father ( @entity76 ) and mother ( @entity78 ) emigrated to @entity10 in the 1970s			1
" i 'm not difficult to work with , trust me			2
when you have my confidence , i will do 200 % for you			0
when you do n't have my confidence ... " the trailing off tells its own story and it 's easy to fill in the blanks , especially given the way @entity1 's time at @entity5 -- which cost the @entity90 giants $ 60 million in addition to the exchange of @entity93 , who @entity5 valued at $ 26 million -- ended following his disagreements with @entity7			1
@entity95 or @entity96 ? the @entity98 coach may have won 14 trophies during his 2008 - 2012 tenure , including two @entity15 crowns , but he earned the wrath of the strong - minded @entity1 when changing his tactics to accommodate the desires of a certain @entity105			2
this all came after ' @entity1 ' had set a @entity5 record in becoming the first player to score in all of his first five league games for the club , a feat that had proved beyond previous club legends such as @entity113 , @entity114 and @entity93 himself			1
" it was a childhood dream [ to join @entity5 ] and i was walking on air , " the @entity10 wrote in his 2011 biography ' i am @entity1 '			1
" it started well but then @entity105 started to talk			0
he wanted to play in the middle , not on the wing , so the system changed from 4 - 3 - 3 to 4 - 5 - 1			0
i was sacrificed and no longer had the freedom on the pitch i need to succeed			0
" over the course of the season , the relationship between the most expensive signing in @entity5 's history and the club coach disintegrated , with @entity1 feeling underused and an ' annoying distraction [ and ] outsider ' for @entity7			1
matters came to a head on 1 may 2010 , three days after @entity5 's @entity15 semifinal exit against @entity137 's @entity54 , with @entity1 letting his frustrations spill out after being consigned to a five - minute substitute role during a 4 - 1 win at @entity141 , " @entity7 was staring at me and i lost it , " continues the @entity10 in ' i am @entity1 '			1
" i thought ' there is my enemy , scratching his bald head ! '			0
i yelled to him : ' you have no balls ! ' and probably worse things than that			0
i added : ' you are s * * * * ing yourself because of [ @entity137 ]			0
you can go to hell ! ' having once told @entity7 that he had ' bought a @entity95 but [ drove ] it like a @entity96 ' , @entity1 now claims that his problems with the @entity153 , who will lead @entity154 next season , had more to do with his persona than his coaching abilities			1
" we have to be clear -- i spoke about @entity7 as a human not as a coach , " the @entity2 star told @entity0			1
" for me , as a coach he is fantastic , as a human , we can discuss			0
" despite his desperation to leave @entity5 , with @entity1 playing his last game for a club ( where he netted 21 goals in 41 games ) one year into a five - year deal , the @entity10 says he looks back on his time with the club favorably			1
" about @entity174 , it 's fantastic			2
i had one year there , a great experience , a fantastic year , " he added			0
" i learned a lot -- outside the pitch , inside the pitch -- and for me it is an amazing club and i have only positive things to say			0
when i come back , hopefully it will be a good game and hopefully i will enjoy it			0
" he has returned to the club once before , losing 3 - 1 last april as @entity22 were dumped out of the @entity15 quarterfinals -- albeit with the former @entity5 man creating the @entity21 ' solitary goal			2
despite winning a remarkable eight league titles in a row with five different clubs between 2004 and 2011 ( the two with @entity53 were later taken away because of the @entity191 corruption scandal ) , @entity1 has famously never won the @entity15			2
and ahead of his date with destiny with @entity105 , @entity196 and @entity197 -- all of whom he described as obedient ' schoolboys ' in the @entity5 dressing room -- the outspoken @entity10 insists it will not be a lasting regret should he never lift the famous trophy			1
" [ i want to the @entity15 ] a lot but that does n't mean anything -- because my career has been fantastic anyway			0

@entity2 striker @entity1 says he does not *deserve* his " bad boy " *reputation*
@entity10 insists he is not difficult to work with , despite his well publicized differences with @entity7 at @entity5
on eve of @entity174 return , ' @entity1 ' says his problems with then @entity5 coach were personal not professional
