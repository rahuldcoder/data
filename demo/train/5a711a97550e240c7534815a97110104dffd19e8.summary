-- a week of @entity2 announcements comes to a climax on friday with the unveiling of the winner of the @entity6 , perhaps the world 's most prestigious award			1
but who 's going to win it ? guessing can be tricky , not least because the names of the nominees are secret			1
we do know that there are a record number of nominees this year , since committee head @entity17 has said 199 individuals and 38 organizations are in the running			1
and the @entity21 seems to like springing surprises			0
few had heard of @entity24 lawyer @entity23 before she won the prize in 2003 , or of @entity27 environmentalist @entity26 before she got it the following year			1
and while practically everyone has heard of the 2009 @entity30 , president @entity31 , practically no one expected him to win the prize within a year of taking office			1
that said , it 's always fun to guess , so here are some of @entity0 's top contenders : @entity39 : the leading @entity41 dissident was sentenced to 11 years in prison late in 2009 for inciting subversion of state power			1
he 's the co-author of @entity45 , a call for political reform and human rights , and was an adviser to the student protesters at @entity51 in 1989			1
his sentencing prompted a groundswell of support for him from former @entity6 laureates and perennial contenders			1
@entity58 , the hero of @entity60 's 1989 @entity59 ( who never won the @entity2 ) , retired @entity63 archbishop @entity62 ( who did , in 1984 ) and the @entity65 ( 1989 ) were among a group of intellectuals who publicly urged the @entity21 to give the prize to @entity39 shortly after he was sentenced			1
@entity70 writer @entity69 , the head of the @entity70 @entity72 center , a literary and human rights organization , nominated @entity39 in january , he said			0
' the @entity74 reported in february that @entity76 spokesman @entity75 said it would be " totally wrong " for " such a person " to win the @entity6 , and that the comment was later scrubbed from the official transcript of the briefing			1
the @entity82 bookmaking @entity83 has already paid out on bets for him to win the prize , it announced wednesday after a surge in betting led it to suspect that information had leaked			1
memorial : born of the violence and repression that accompanied the final days of the @entity93 , the @entity90 human rights group now focuses on monitoring " hot spots " or conflict zones within the country -- a task that has proven deadly			2
the group 's leading activist in @entity100 , @entity101 , was kidnapped and murdered in july 2009			2
she was shot in the head and the chest , and her body was dumped in the neighboring @entity90 republic of @entity106			0
@entity101 had worked in @entity100 for more than 10 years and had openly criticized @entity100 's @entity108 - backed president , @entity109 , and his methods			1
her murder outraged human rights activists worldwide			0
@entity113 , the @entity114 , the @entity115 and the @entity70 were among those appealing to @entity90 to conduct a transparent investigation of the crime			0
@entity119 : the first woman to be president of @entity82 went on to be the @entity123 high commissioner for human rights , a post she held from 1997 to 2002			0
after she left the @entity123 , she founded a new organization , @entity125 , which aims " to put human rights standards at the heart of global governance and policy - making and to ensure that the needs of the poorest and most vulnerable are addressed on the global stage			2
" @entity135 also is a member of the @entity136 , a group of leading statesmen and stateswomen brought together by former @entity63 president @entity137 -- himself a nobel laureate -- to support peace building and try to address the major causes of human suffering			0
the 13 current , former and honorary elders include six @entity6 winners			1
@entity135 trained as a lawyer and has argued cases before the @entity146 , the @entity146 in @entity147 , and @entity82 courts			0
@entity149 : the longtime leader of the opposition to @entity153 's president @entity152 entered an uneasy power - sharing agreement with his rival in 2009 , becoming prime minister			1
@entity149 has led the @entity157 since 1999 , surviving three assassination attempts , beatings and imprisonment			0
he rejects the charge that he " sold out " or gave legitimacy to @entity152 with the power - sharing agreement			2
" the country was confronted with chaos and anarchy			0
we rescued our country and saved it in order to have the long - term stability that we are looking for , " he told @entity0 last month			2
he continues to press for " a credible and legitimate election " in @entity153 , he said			0
@entity171 : the chairperson of @entity174 's @entity173 , @entity171 is a medical doctor who fled @entity174 when its communist regime arrested her husband in 1984			2
she remained in exile until 2002 when she was appointed as a women 's affairs minister in @entity174 president @entity180 's transitional administration			2
she 's done work on human rights around the world , not only in @entity174			0
she served as the @entity123 special rapportuer for human rights in @entity185 from 2005 to 2009 , and was considered for the post of @entity187 , according to an organization which tries to predict @entity6 winners			1
" she has been under frequent attacks both from conservative religious leaders and from @entity199 radicals , and she is a prominent voice for the rights of women , " the @entity190 said , adding that she " does invite respect by being a principled and outspoken proponent of human rights and the need for a true reconciliatory process			0
" @entity190 is not connected to the @entity202 , which chooses the winners			0
its director , @entity204 , also considers the @entity206 news agency and the @entity207 to be top contenders			0
@entity0 's @entity209 , @entity210 and @entity211 contributed to this report .			0

@entity214 says he is surprised and " very *grateful* "
prizes in medicine , *physics* and *chemistry* have already been announced
