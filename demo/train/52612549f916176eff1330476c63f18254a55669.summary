-- @entity1 acknowledged sunday that it edited recordings of what it said were anti-semitic and @entity6 radio calls by @entity8 activists who tried to run the @entity10 blockade and that it could not identify the origin of the broadcasts			1
the @entity1 military released a 26 - second recording friday night in which a warning call to a ship in the flotilla was met with the reply of " shut up -- go back to @entity20			1
" after another voice reports that the convoy has the permission of @entity25 officials to dock in @entity10 , a third voice responds , " we are helping @entity27 going against the @entity28 do n't forget 9/11 , guys			0
" but after the organizers of the aid convoy accused @entity1 officials of manipulating the tapes , the @entity30 reported it had mistakenly identified one of the six ships in the activists ' " @entity37 " as the source of the broadcasts			1
and it released a nearly six - minute recording of radio traffic that included those calls and several others , along with bursts of static and calls in other languages on the same channel			0
" so to clarify : the audio was edited down to cut out periods of silence over the radio as well as incomprehensible comments so as to make it easier for people to listen to the exchange , " the @entity1 military said in a statement posted on its web site			1
and it added , " due to an open channel , the specific ship or ships in the ' @entity37 ' responding to the @entity1 @entity63 could not be identified			2
" @entity1 commandos intercepted the convoy at sea on may 31 and stormed the largest vessel , the @entity68 - flagged @entity67 , killing nine people aboard			2
the ships were carrying humanitarian aid to @entity10 , the @entity25 territory that has been blockaded by @entity1 since its takeover by the @entity74 movement @entity73 in 2007 , and the deadly raid sparked international condemnation			2
convoy organizers from @entity78 said @entity1 " doctored " the recordings " in order to paint the flotilla passengers as @entity82			1
" the group denied its vessels were the source of the broadcasts and said the @entity1 accusations made " no more sense with the explanation			1
" " all radio transmissions on the sea are heard by all captains , " the group said			0
" once again , @entity1 is caught in a lie trying to defend itself for the murder and mayhem it committed the morning of may 31 , 2010			0
" on the full recording , an @entity1 warship hails one of the vessels in the flotilla to warn it was approaching a blockade zone and warned that " all necessary measures " would be taken to prevent it from docking in @entity10			0
after three warnings , @entity78 activist @entity106 replied that the blockade was a violation of international law and that the convoy was carrying only humanitarian aid			0
" we do not carry anything that constitutes a threat to your armed forces , " she says on the recording .			0
