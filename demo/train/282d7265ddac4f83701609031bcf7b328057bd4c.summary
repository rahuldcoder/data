-- @entity2 , slow - moving lines stretched around polling stations across @entity4 a week after @entity6 's fury threatened to keep many citizens from voting			1
" it 's inspiring to see so many people up and out to vote already , " said one woman at a makeshift polling station in @entity10 established to replace regular precinct locations made unusable by storm damage			1
while inspiring to some , the long wait to cast a ballot was frustrating for others			2
@entity19 intensifies misery for @entity6 victims gov. @entity23 's last - minute decree that any voter could vote at any precinct , intended to help those displaced by @entity6 , made it " a little insane right now " at the polling station at @entity30 41 in @entity31 , a poll coordinator there told @entity0 tuesday afternoon			1
" so we have everybody coming in from everywhere , " said the coordinator , a @entity33 who asked not to be named			1
" it was for displaced people , but others are taking advantage of it			2

voters must stand in two lines now : one for filling out the ballot and a second for scanning it			0
" today is an interesting day , " @entity4 elections commissioner @entity60 said			1
in some cases , three or four voting sites were consolidated into one location because of @entity6 damage , @entity60 said			0
that means 3,000 or 4,000 voters potentially standing in the line instead of just 1,000 , he said			0
heavy turnout reported " we 'd ask the patience and tolerance of @entity4 , " @entity23 said during an afternoon news conference			1
" this is a critical election			0

it 's part of the process			0
" at one temporary polling station inside a @entity10 school , which was also used as a shelter for residents displaced by last week 's storm , one man said the long line was too much for him tuesday morning			2
" i 've got time in the afternoon , but right now i do n't , " he told @entity0			0
" but i 'll be back to make the wait			0
" voters in some @entity4 counties could get an extra day to cast ballots if disruptions caused by @entity6 prevent enough citizens from showing up at the polls , a state official said sunday			1
opinion : rethinking grid dependence @entity120 election officials could ask the state board of elections to allow polling places to reopen for another day if tuesday 's turnout is less than 25 % , according to board spokesman @entity124			1

polls would be open for 11 hours on the second day , with only those who were eligible to vote on tuesday allowed to cast ballots			2
