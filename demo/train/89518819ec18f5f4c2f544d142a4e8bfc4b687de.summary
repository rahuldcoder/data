@entity0 -- anticipating possible political backlash if forced federal spending cuts kick in as expected later this week , the @entity4 's no. 2 @entity2 said monday that he is preparing a message he plans to hit hard : the cuts are not going to have as negative an impact as the @entity10 and others in the @entity13 administration are saying			1
sen. @entity14 of @entity15 said he plans to make the case to other @entity2 and the public that despite warnings from the @entity10 that the mandated cuts will be devastating , the overall amount of defense spending will actually still rise			1
@entity14 conceded that until now he had been parroting what defense secretary @entity22 continuously warns -- that automatic , government - wide cuts could jeopardize national security			1
but the veteran senator said he looked into it and will now argue that even if the cuts go through on march 1 , the @entity10 will still see its budget go up			2
@entity14 's preview of what he hopes will be a @entity4 @entity33 argument is significant since defense cuts are usually something @entity2 adamantly oppose			1
he will surely run up against some in his party who strongly disagree			0
to be sure , @entity14 called himself a defense " hawk " and did say the role of the federal government should be first and foremost to protect @entity42 citizens			2
where you 'll feel forced spending cuts but he also believes that the deficit should be paramount since the @entity42 has ended its fighting in @entity50 and is winding down the war in @entity52			1
he added that if " @entity54 forbid " another 9/11 happens , @entity53 would act			0
still , @entity4 @entity2 are considering a proposal this week that could alleviate some impacts of the cuts by giving the president flexibility to decide where they would occur			0
however , @entity33 sources tell @entity1 that @entity2 have not yet worked out among themselves whether their measure would give the president that flexibility on all domestic agencies and programs or just on defense			1
@entity33 sources say they are likely to work that out when @entity4 @entity2 huddle for their regular lunch on tuesday			2
the $ 85 billion in forced spending cuts were written into law intentionally to be indiscriminate			2
opinion : if spending is cut , @entity33 will get the blame the law does not allow , for example , the @entity10 to keep funding going for a ship building program by shifting money being spent on a military golf course			1
and it does not allow the @entity81 to keep children in @entity84 programs by cutting deeper in another agency			0
part of the reason @entity33 leaders have not decided yet how broad that flexibility should be -- whether it should apply just to the defense cuts , as many @entity2 want , or to domestic cuts as well â € ” is due to differences in opinion among @entity2 over how much power to give the president			1
but it is a key decision , since granting the president flexibility in cuts across the board could make it hard for conservative democrats , such as those from defense industry - rich @entity103 , to oppose			0
that 's because such an approach could soften the political burden for those @entity101 who would be able to argue to their constituents they did everything possible -- including providing flexibility to the @entity115 -- if economic damage ripples through their states			0
but one influential @entity2 senator told @entity1 on sunday that he opposes giving the president so much flexibility because it undermines the decision - making authority of @entity53			0
opinion : there 's plenty to cut at the @entity10 " i say to my @entity2 friends , if you want to give the president flexibility as to how to exact these cuts in defense spending , then why do n't we go home and just give him the money ? i am totally opposed to that , " sen. @entity135 , @entity136 , said on @entity1 's " @entity137			1
" " we spent too long on defense authorization and finding out what this country needs to secure this country without saying , ' hey , well we 'll just let the president have the , quote , flexibility			0
' " a competing @entity4 @entity101 proposal would replace the automatic spending cuts with a mix of tax increases on wealthier @entity42 and more targeted spending reductions than those currently required			1
@entity101 leaders believe it will get more than 50 votes -- so they will be able to claim it won a majority in the chamber -- but will fall short of the 60 it would need to win @entity4 approval			0
in the meantime , both sides are preparing for no change -- and for forced spending cuts to take effect friday			1
@entity101 leadership sources admit that whether or not they can ultimately do anything to change the way across - the - board cuts are enacted will depend on the level of public outcry -- and media coverage			0
@entity101 admit the impact may not be felt for at least a month , maybe more			0
assuming no legislation is passed to alter the cuts this week , sources in both parties say they are already looking ahead to the next big deadline on march 27 , when the funding for the government runs out			0
a @entity101 congressional source tells @entity1 that at this point , @entity101 do not believe the @entity115 wants to use that debate to revisit forced spending cuts , but the source said that could change depending on public reaction to the cuts .			2

@entity15 senator believes cuts may not be as bad for defense as the @entity10 says
@entity14 could face *criticism* from fellow @entity2 with @entity33 strong on defense
@entity10 would *absorb* half of the automatic , government - wide spending cuts
cuts due to take effect on friday *absent* congressional action to avert them
