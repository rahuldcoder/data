-- @entity2 's @entity1 gave her @entity4 speech in @entity5 on saturday , more than two decades after she won the peace prize			1
her presence in @entity8 , @entity5 , on a historic first trip to @entity10 after years of house arrest , signals the progress toward reform in @entity2 , also known as @entity2 , over the past year			1
@entity1 was unable to accept the @entity4 when it was awarded in 1991 because she was under house arrest in @entity2			1
her husband and two sons accepted it then on her behalf , paying tribute to her sacrifice			0
greeted by heartfelt applause from those gathered in @entity22 , @entity1 spoke of what peace meant to her and also of her country 's fragile progress toward democratic reform			1
" over the past year there have been signs that the endeavors of those who believe in democracy and human rights are beginning to bear fruit in @entity2			1
there have been changes in a positive direction ; steps towards democratization have been taken , " she said			0
" if i advocate cautious optimism it is not because i do not have faith in the future but because i do not want to encourage blind faith			1
" speaking as a former prisoner of conscience , she appealed for the " earliest , unconditional release " of all prisoners of conscience still held in @entity2			1
of her own work for democracy , she said it had never occurred to her that it might one day lead to any award or honor			0
" the prize we were working for was a free , secure and just society where our people might be able to realize their full potential			2
the honor lay in our endeavor			0
history had given us the opportunity to give of our best for a cause in which we believed , " she said			0
" when the @entity70 chose to honor me , the road i had chosen of my own free will became a less lonely path to follow			0
for this i thank the @entity70 , the people of @entity5 and peoples all over the world whose support has strengthened my faith in the common quest for peace			2
" earlier in her speech , she explained how the prize at first " did not seem quite real " but that her understanding of it changed through her long isolation under house arrest , as she became aware of how it was being discussed in the wider world			1
the peace prize " had made me real once again ; it had drawn me back into the wider human community			2
and what was more important , the @entity4 had drawn the attention of the world to the struggle for democracy and human rights in @entity2			1
we were not going to be forgotten			2
" she said the prize , for her , meant extending her concern for democracy and human rights beyond national borders			1
what @entity1 's moment shows us and years later , much of the world is still seeking peace as " negative forces " eat away at its foundations , she said			1
" fires of suffering and strife are raging around the world			0
in my own country , hostilities have not ceased in the far north ; to the west , communal violence resulting in arson and murder were taking place just several days before i started out on the journey that has brought me here today			2
" introducing @entity1 , @entity120 chairman @entity119 paid tribute to her " awe - inspiring tenacity , sacrifice , and firmness of principle			1
" he recalled how her son accepted the award on her behalf in 1991 , and the challenges @entity1 faced during her long years of house arrest in @entity2 , during which her husband died in @entity131			1
" you carry a heavy burden on your shoulders			0
no one can be certain of what the future will bring			0
but today you are here			0
and we know for sure that you can return home , " he said			0
" few have done more than you have to make the world a better place for all of us			0
we thank you for your fearlessness , your tenacity and your strength			0
" you bring hope to the oppressed people across the world			0
your life is a message to all of us ... you have paid a high price but you have been spreading hope , and the world needs hope			0
" speaking to @entity0 's @entity155 from @entity8 ahead of the ceremony , @entity1 explained that she was still exploring the question of what peace means			1
" my attitude to peace is rather based on the @entity2 definition of peace -- it really means removing all the negative factors that destroy peace in this world			2
so peace does not mean just putting an end to violence or to war , but to all other factors that threaten peace , such as discrimination , such as inequality , poverty , " she said			0
@entity119 : what @entity1 's moment shows us while in @entity10 , @entity1 is also scheduled to address both houses of the @entity131 @entity175 , be the guest of honor at a concert in @entity179 , @entity180 , and celebrate her 67th birthday with family			2
the trip is @entity1 's second abroad since she returned to @entity2 , also known as @entity2 , in 1988 to care for her dying mother , and comes on the heels of her first trip outside the country earlier this year			1
@entity1 was recently elected to parliament as her @entity190 won dozens of seats in by - elections			2
it remains a minority in parliament , but the elections marked a turning point for the country after decades of oppression by its military rulers			2
a military coup in september 1988 put gen. @entity202 in power , setting off anti-government demonstrations and a crackdown that left hundreds dead			0
@entity1 -- whose husband , @entity206 , remained in @entity207 -- became a leading activist and co-founder of an opposition group , the @entity190			2
she was placed under house arrest for the first time the following july on charges of trying to divide the military			1
she spent much of the next two decades confined to her home by the ruling junta			0
when her party won the 1990 general election in a landslide vote , the military rulers -- in power since 1962 -- refused to let the @entity190 serve , nullifying the results			0
a year later , @entity1 won the @entity175 's @entity222 as well as the @entity223 , which cited her " nonviolent struggle for democracy and human rights			1
" but she remained in detention			0
accepting the prize at the time on his mother 's behalf , @entity228 said , " i personally believe that , by her own dedication and personal sacrifice , she has come to be a worthy symbol through whom the plight of all the people of @entity2 may be recognized			1
" the military rulers have since loosened their grip on power , allowing a series of democratic reforms			0
her house arrest ended in 2010 , and she was able to travel around the country during her party 's election campaign this year			1
smiling @entity1 lays out ' ambitious ' plan for @entity2			1

new : @entity1 says she advocates " cautious optimism " because she fears blind faith
new : she appeals for all prisoners of conscience still held in @entity2 to be freed
she says being awarded the prize meant the plight of her country was not forgotten
she was given the @entity223 in 1991 , but was under house arrest in @entity2
