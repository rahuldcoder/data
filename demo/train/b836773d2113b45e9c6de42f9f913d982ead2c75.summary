-- relief expressed sunday at the death of @entity4 bomber @entity3 by relatives of some of his 270 victims was tempered by still - smoldering anger at his release from prison more than two years ago			1
he deserved to die , " said @entity13 of @entity14 , @entity15 , whose daughter @entity16 died in the december 1988 airplane bombing over @entity18 , @entity19			1
" he was a mass murderer			0
i feel no pity around him			0
he got to die with his family around him			0
my daughter , at age 20 , died a brutal , horrible death			1
" @entity26 was the only person convicted in connection with the bombing			0
in august 2009 , he was released from a @entity19 prison on the grounds that he was diagnosed with terminal prostate cancer and had only a few months to live			0
he was sent home to @entity33 on " compassionate " grounds , receiving a hero 's welcome at the airport			1
2011 : convicted @entity18 bomber says truth will eventually come out " i think @entity3 exemplified the classic case that no matter how heinous the crime , that justice can be bought , " said @entity39 of @entity40 , who lost her husband @entity41 in the bombing and serves as co-president of the @entity45 group			1
" his death is a relief , " @entity39 said			0
" finally @entity3 will be judged by the highest of authorities -- our maker , his maker			0
" @entity55 of @entity56 , @entity57 , whose 29 - year - old son @entity58 died aboard the plane , said , " it 's about time			1
i 'm glad he 's dead			1
" but she called the deal resulting in @entity3 's release " disgraceful			1
" " he was supposed to be ill and was allegedly ready to die , " @entity55 said			0
" he went home to his family , and our son never came home			0
" at the time of @entity3 's release , @entity71 , son of then - @entity33 leader @entity73 , told @entity33 channel @entity74 that " in all commercial contracts for oil and gas with @entity79 , ( @entity3 ) was always on the negotiating table , " adding that then - @entity79 prime minister @entity81 raised @entity3 's case each time he visited @entity33			1
2011 : @entity0 's @entity83 tracks down @entity18 bomber @entity81 said that while @entity33 brought up @entity3 , no deals were ever made when he was in power to arrange for his release			1
@entity79 authorities rejected that @entity3 's release was tied to @entity79 business deals with @entity33			1
however , victims ' relatives expressed disbelief			2
" that was a disgusting deal that involved oil and money , " @entity13 said			0
" all of us , " said @entity39 , " have been pawns in all of this			0
" @entity100 of @entity15 , whose brother @entity101 was aboard @entity102 103 , said sunday he was " pleased " at @entity3 's death			2
@entity3 's 2009 release , he said , was " when i was most angry in this 24 - year journey			1
" @entity33 agreed in 2003 to pay $ 2.7 billion in compensation to the families of the bombing victims , though @entity73 always remained cagey about admitting official @entity33 involvement in the bombing			1
@entity73 died in october following months of unrest in @entity33			1
" @entity73 's death brought me a great deal of , the word is , pleasure , " @entity13 said			2
" i was happy when he died because he was the primary villain in this			2
" @entity3 , she said , was " sent to do the job			0
" @entity100 said @entity73 's ouster and death also helped reduce some of his anger at @entity3 's release			1
" he was the big fish and @entity3 , as far as i 'm concerned , became a minor actor once @entity73 was killed , " he said			0
but , he said , the release was " a true act of betrayal by our government and the @entity79 government			2
" he felt the @entity133 did n't do enough to keep @entity3 behind bars			0
the full truth about the bombing may have died with @entity3 , who never provided details			2
if @entity3 had not been released , @entity13 said , he might have talked when the @entity73 regime fell			0
but @entity13 and @entity100 said they believe others still in @entity33 or former @entity73 regime officials may also have been complicit in the bombing , and that @entity133 and @entity79 officials should go into the country and conduct interviews in an effort to find them			1
" he was not the only person taking orders , " @entity13 said of @entity3			0
" ... we really do need to know how these terrible things are done and who 's involved in them ... the key is , where do we go from here ? " @entity39 said she previously met with @entity81 , who told her the @entity19 authorities were the ones who released @entity3			2
and she said in the fall , she met with @entity162 , chairman of @entity33 's @entity163 , who has said he has proof @entity73 ordered the bombing			1
after the @entity73 regime fell last year , @entity133 officials renewed their call for @entity3 's imprisonment			2
" once there 's a government in place , we will renew our calls that @entity3 , who should never have been released in the first place , be returned to serve the rest of his sentence , " secretary of state @entity168 said in october			2
however , @entity39 said , " i do n't think the @entity133 government or the @entity79 government has the will to find out the truth about why @entity4 was attacked and hold people involved accountable			1
we 've seen ( nearly ) 24 years of turning the page			0
" " both the @entity19 and @entity79 governments have not been forthcoming , " said @entity133 sen. @entity182 , @entity183 - @entity57 , on sunday			0
" the whole deal ( regarding @entity3 's release ) smelled of a trade of oil for this man 's freedom , and that was almost blasphemy given what a horrible person he was and the terrible destruction and tragedy he caused			1
" " this is long overdue , " @entity55 said of @entity3 's death			2
" it 's been 23 years now , but you never get over losing your kid			0
" @entity0 's @entity201 contributed to this report .			0
