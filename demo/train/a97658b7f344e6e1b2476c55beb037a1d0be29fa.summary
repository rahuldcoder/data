-- very few things will make my skin crawl more than listening to someone totally misrepresent the famous " @entity8 " speech the rev. @entity7 gave on august 28 , 1963			1
it 's clear that far too many people have n't bothered to actually read or listen to the speech			1
instead , folks -- especially those who likely would have branded @entity7 a communist , a socialist , a @entity15 or a racial hell - bent on destroying @entity17 -- love to tout @entity7 's " content of character " line in order to push back against a variety of issues , especially affirmative action			1
just today , i saw a press release from @entity26 , a coalition of black conservatives , suggesting that a rally planned saturday by a radio talk show host and @entity31 personality is akin to @entity7 's 1963 march			1
@entity32 , a member of @entity26 , is quoted as saying , " the dream of @entity7 -- that every person be judged by their character rather than their color -- is one of the tenets that makes our nation honorable in the minds of people around the world			2
@entity7 's legacy is a gift to us all , and no one person or organization holds claim to his work and his message			2
i can think of no better way to honor him by renewing our shared commitment to uphold those principles that have held our country together throughout history			2
" it 's clear that @entity59 , and so many others , has n't read a history book or other publications surrounding the march and instead loves to continue to spread falsehoods , misrepresentations and outright fabrications stemming from the @entity68 march			1
first , we need to stop calling it the march on @entity68			1
it was officially called the @entity71			2
if you leave off the " @entity75 " part , it sounds like black folks just went for a walk that day			2
upset with the lack of economic opportunities for blacks at the time , as well as the voting rights injustices , the organizers wanted to put pressure on @entity84 and the president @entity86 administration to put their muscle behind a comprehensive civil rights bill			1
no , the 1963 march had nothing to do with some hokey values espoused by a radio / tv windbag			2
it was a day to assemble a mass of people to represent a show of strength and to get leaders in @entity68 to listen to the urgent need across the country			1
second , we continue to misrepresent @entity7 's speech as the " @entity8 " speech			1
as @entity0 's @entity103 reported in the special " @entity104 : words that changed a @entity108 , " the speech was never called that			1
it was actually titled " normalcy : never again			2
" in fact , the " @entity8 " portion , which represents the bottom third of it , was n't in the original text			2
as @entity103 reported , @entity7 often gave variations of the " dream " portion of the speech , and on that day , he was encouraged by gospel great @entity119 to tell the audience about his " dream			1
" there is no doubt that his soaring oratory about the need for racial harmony continues to send chills down our spines today , but if we as a country get so excited and wrapped up in the " dream " sequence , we forget the economic nightmare @entity7 painted in the top two - thirds of the speech			1
when i give speeches , i often tell folks that the " @entity8 " portion is the " hoop " part , which is when the pastor begins sing , scream and shout when he / she has finished the sermon			2
but the real measure of a sermon is the scripture , which serves as the thesis			2
so let 's get to the meat -- or the purpose -- of @entity7 's 1963 speech			1
at the top , he lays out the vision of slaves being freed by the @entity156 , yet 100 years later , " one hundred years later , the life of the @entity158 is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination			0
one hundred years later , the @entity158 lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity			0
one hundred years later , the @entity158 is still languished in the corners of @entity17 society and finds himself an exile in his own land			0
" then he makes clear that the purpose of going to the @entity174 is to " dramatize a shameful condition			0
" " in a sense , we 've come to our nation 's capital to cash a check , " @entity7 said			0
" when the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the @entity185 and the @entity186 , they were signing a promissory note to which every @entity17 was to fall heir			0
" this note was a promise that all men , yes , black men as well as white men , would be guaranteed the ' unalienable rights ' of ' @entity195			0
' it is obvious today that @entity17 has defaulted on this promissory note , insofar as her citizens of color are concerned			1
instead of honoring this sacred obligation , @entity17 has given the @entity158 people a bad check , a check which has come back marked ' insufficient funds			0
' " but we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt			0
we refuse to believe that there are insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity of this nation			0
and so , we 've come to cash this check , a check that will give us upon demand the riches of freedom and the security of justice			0
" @entity7 then began to talk about the " fierce urgency of now , " laying out the treacherous conditions upon which black people lived in , and having to deal with violence and the trampling of their rights			0
he laid bare the despair of not being able to stay in hotel rooms , having to drink out of segregated water fountains and the lack of voting rights			0
then @entity7 launches into the portion about his " dream			0
" folks , the fulfillment of @entity7 's dream was n't about getting along			0
it was about every man and woman being afforded equal rights and an opportunity to find a job , raise their family and not have to suffer from brutality			0
his speech was n't partisan or political ; it was prophetic and about prosperity			1
how is it relevant today ? if anyone wants to model that march , then stop with the ego - driven nonsense and focus on pushing @entity84 to enact a jobs bill so @entity17 can work			1
tell @entity253 and @entity254 to stop playing footsy with lobbyists and looking out for @entity258 's interests			0
tell leaders in @entity68 to give a damn about the poor of this country , from the hills of @entity264 to the dusty roads in @entity266			1
tell some republicans to stop their shameful condemnations of @entity17 who ca n't find a job			0
for the nearly 250,000 who gathered on the steps of the @entity174 on august 28 , 1963 , it was n't about ego ; it was about results			0
there was no partisan agenda ; it was one where whites and blacks refused to stand idly by and watch black @entity17 denied an opportunity to thrive in this country			0
in the final five years of his life , @entity7 fought for equal pay for sanitation workers in @entity287 and was planning a @entity288 to highlight the economic injustices			1
please , take the time to go and read or listen to the speech			1
and do n't try to pimp and pervert @entity7 's prophetic word so you can score some political points			0
and that goes for a charlatan , even if they have a tv or radio show , who seeks to align themselves with @entity7 's momentous and radical speech 47 years ago			2
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity306 .			1

@entity306 says the famous speech is often misrepresented
he cites a rally set for saturday in @entity68 as one example
two - thirds of speech paints picture of an economic nightmare , he says
the best move today would be to push for a jobs bill , @entity306 *writes*
