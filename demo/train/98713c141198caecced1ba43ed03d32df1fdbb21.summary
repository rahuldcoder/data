a federal law requiring that screening machines commonly found at schools , courthouses and other public facilities be able to detect all types of firearms will expire in less than a month			1
and that deadline is suddenly very relevant because of the availability of lethal @entity11 printable guns that contain virtually no metal , law enforcement authorities say			1
two proposed bills to extend the metal - detection requirement have almost no chance of passing , according to lawmakers			0
and authorities say that creates a public safety hazard from guns that are homemade from hard plastic materials on printers that cost between $ 1,000 and $ 500,000			1
the @entity23 this week for the first time made public the tests it has done on a model of handgun called the @entity28 , made using @entity11 printer technology			2
some performed well while others did not , the @entity23 tests showed			1
@entity34 company makes metal gun with @entity11 printer one gun made using a plastic called @entity40 , commonly used in toys and luggage , fired a .380 - caliber round without failing all eight times it was tested at an @entity23 lab in @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity23 officials said			1
the firearm was made of molded opaque plastic , larger than a common handgun , and it contained one small metal firing pin similar to a roofing nail			1
the fired round traveled 8 to 11 inches into a piece of gelatin molded to simulate human soft tissue ; by comparison a commercially available .380 pistol fired a round 18 inches in the same simulation			0
" the liberator is a lethal weapon , " said @entity61 , chief of the @entity62			0
the tested model included one with a removable metal block that complies with the expiring metal - detection law when the block is removed			1
a similar gun could be made with a ceramic firing pin to go undetected			1
@entity72 police raise specter of 3 - d printer - made guns another pistol made from a plastic called @entity78 did n't perform as well in @entity23 tests			1
video of the tests in june showed the gun exploding into a dozen plastic shards when fired			2
the @entity28 guns were made from blueprints uploaded last year by a group led by a @entity34 law student , @entity87			2
the group @entity88 says it exists " to defend the civil liberty of popular access to arms as guaranteed by the @entity92 and affirmed by the @entity93 , through facilitating global access to , and the collaborative production of , information and knowledge related to the 3d printing of arms			0
" @entity87 told @entity100 in an interview earlier this year : " the assumption is one day the technology will become more ubiquitous and widespread			0
" the files that can be used to make a @entity11 printable gun have been downloaded hundreds of thousands of times , @entity23 officials said			2
for decades , manufacturers have increased the use of plastic in lightweight guns , as in other products			2
many popular models made with plastic parts still must use a certain amount of metal to abide by the detectability law			2
it 's not clear if any commercial gun makers will abandon metal components once the law expires			0
the expiration comes amid a spate of mass shootings in the @entity125 , though none of the recent shootings have involved firearms passed through metal detectors			0
attorney general @entity130 called on @entity131 to renew the law requiring guns be detectable by metal screening machines " this is an extremely serious problem			1
this is an extremely serious threat to law enforcement , to people who fly every day , " @entity130 said in remarks in @entity137 on thursday			2
" think about this : there is the possibility that ( if ) this legislation is ( not ) renewed and it expires in early december ... plastic guns could not be detected by metal detectors ( and ) could be smuggled into a variety of places			1
and , it would seem to me that whatever people 's feelings are about gun safety legislation , that this is something we could all agree needs to be reauthorized			0
" @entity130 added : " i think that there are at least a few things that are so common sense and so logical that even those factions that are warring on other things can come together and decide that we ca n't have guns that are not detectable by metal detectors			0
" a handful of lawmakers are backing bills in the @entity168 and @entity169 to try to extend the detectable firearms law but there 's no indication they 'll get a vote in a @entity131 that is bitterly divided on many issues , including gun safety laws			0
rep. @entity177 , @entity11 - @entity178 , said that when the law was first passed in 1988 , " a @entity11 plastic gun was science fiction			1
" he said it 's unfathomable that there 's not enough support to extend the law			0
" this is the absolute worst and most dangerous time to let this law expire , " @entity177 said			0
@entity11 gun raid in @entity72 may have nabbed printer parts			0

expiring law could create public safety hazard , law enforcement officials said
@entity23 tests show @entity197 printable guns proved to be lethal
removable metal firing pin allows plastic guns to go undetected at screening machines
lawmaker said when law was passed in the 1980s , plastic guns were " science fiction "
