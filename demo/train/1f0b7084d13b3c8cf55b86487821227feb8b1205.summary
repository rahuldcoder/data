" i 'm going to f -- king kill you , " he says			0
" the @entity41 described the protester involved in what it deemed " a verbal exchange " to be " peaceful			1
" another man in the crowd then says out loud , " did you threaten to kill him ? " the officer is asked for his name , to which he responds : " go f -- k yourself			2
" protesters proceed to mock the officer before he 's led away by another member of law enforcement			1

complete coverage of @entity4 shooting and protests the @entity41 said that one of its sergeants " walked over and immediately took action , forcing the officer to lower the weapon and escorting him away from the area			1

" in this case , we did see something happen to that officer immediately , " @entity97 told @entity0 's @entity107			2
" and that sends a strong message that at least the folks at the top are getting it			1

" he defended the officers on the front lines of the protests , saying they have shown " admirable restraint " -- a view that 's not shared by some activists -- despite being persistently egged on			2
" you 're asking them to stand there and stare into the faces of people who are spitting on them , who are yelling at them , who are screaming at them , ... who are touching them , " @entity115 told @entity0 's @entity130			0
" you 're saying : just take it			0
and ... by and large , they do			0
" sometimes -- as in this particular cases , the lawyer conceded -- a police officer may act improperly			1
if they do , @entity115 claimed that it is " a fatigue issue , " not " a training issue , " related to the psychological wear on being on the streets of @entity4 day after day			0
