@entity0 , @entity1 -- the class of 1963 crowded in a rectangle on the dance floor , the memories of high school fresh on their minds as the band played in a sea of pink and blue hues			1
just what you would expect to be playing at a 1960s prom			1
yet the song that drew the most bodies to the dance floor was " the wobble			0
" until this hip - hop song emptied the chairs , it felt as if the auditorium had been transported back 50 years			0
but it 's 2013 , and despite the full - court nostalgia for the 1960s , that decade was one of the most difficult times in @entity0 's history			1
societal tensions over race were so high in 1963 that the city canceled senior prom for five of the city 's segregated high schools for blacks			1
today , a half century has passed since the seminal civil rights protests that changed @entity0 and plotted a path for the nation away from segregation and toward equal rights			1
just like that path , the healing process has been a long one			0
the @entity46 , held friday and hosted by the city of @entity0 , closed one chapter for these @entity49			1
' a tension - filled city ' growing up in @entity0 in the 1950s , @entity52 knew the rules of this segregated city			1
at a restaurant , she could pay in the front , but had to walk around the back to get her food from a cook			0
she could shop only in certain places ; there were neighborhoods that she knew not to visit			0
" as a child , i recognized that it was unfair , but did n't understand that there were laws propping ( segregation ) up , " she said as she waited for a hair appointment before friday 's prom			1
more : segregated prom yields to unity she treated herself to a hair styling before donning a lavender dress with a sequined jacket and matching shoes			1
@entity77 was a fitting color , she said , not just because it is her favorite , but because it was the school color at @entity80			0
it was a day of celebration that she and her classmates were denied in 1963			1
segregation in @entity0 permeated everything , down to the @entity86 that judges used to swear witnesses in -- there was one holy book for white witnesses and another for black witnesses			1
yet members of the class of 1963 recall having the same struggles as any other teenagers , then and today -- parents ' rules , scrounging enough money for dates , finding reliable transportation			1
as often is the case when people witness a historic period , many black high school students in @entity0 in 1963 did not recognize the moment that was upon them			1
years of advocacy by civil rights leaders had successfully chipped away at segregation , and students pushed the boundaries -- as much out of teenage rebellion as a sense of justice			1
opinion : for dr. @entity117 , everybody in and nobody out @entity119 and her friends were the first ones to board the bus the day that the signs relegating blacks to the back of the bus were removed , around the summer of 1962			0
the teens tested the new limits immediately by sitting in the front			0
but when whites began boarding the bus , they stood , rather than sit behind the black teens			1
the teens also noticed that white riders refused to sit next to black riders , so instead of sitting two to a seat , they spread out individually to occupy the seats , leaving other passengers no choice but to sit next to them			1
again , the white riders chose to stand			0
" it was a tension - filled city , " may said			1
it was against this backdrop that the seniors at the black high schools began preparing for graduation			1
each may , in @entity150 ' neighborhood , the graduating seniors would parade down the street			2
and in 1963 , it would be her turn			2
there was also prom , an @entity158 rite of passage			2
@entity150 can still picture her long dress , a blue and green neon attention - grabber that showed different colors in the light as she moved			0
a neighbor had bought it for her in december			0
" even though it was a winter dress , i was going to wear it to the prom , " @entity150 said			2
" but in one fell swoop , that was wiped away			0
" civil rights come to @entity0 there is disagreement over why prom was canceled for those five black high schools in 1963			1
the civil rights movement was in full swing that year , but the high school students , to an extent , were kept at a distance from it			2
this would change on may 2 , 1963 , when hundreds of children , some as young as 6 , left school to march in @entity0 in opposition to segregation			1
@entity2 photo blog : @entity0 's civil rights crusade thousands of arrests were made at the so - called @entity190 , and when the marches persisted for several days , authorities responded with fire hoses and dogs			1
" this was a very controversial thing , " said @entity195 , a history professor at @entity196 who has written a book about @entity0 during this period			1
" there were those who did not believe that schoolchildren should be engaging in civil rights protests			2
not only was it dangerous , but they were youth and it was a very confrontational thing			0
" the images of children being hosed and intimidated by police dogs renewed a level of outrage at the national level that had been flagging			1
" it changed the dynamic of the protest dramatically , " @entity195 said			0
" it encouraged other youth to participate on one hand , and on the other it ratcheted up the pressure on the forces of white supremacy			0
" 50 years since @entity117 's letter from a @entity0 jail only a fraction of students from the black high schools participated			1
many were told by their parents not to participate , for fear of losing a job or other retribution			0
@entity150 did n't march because her grandfather expressed concerns that he might be fired if someone saw her protesting			0
but everyone would be affected by the protests , whether they marched or not			2
days after the marches , the school board announced that all end - of - the - year activities were canceled for the class of 1963			1
no prom , no graduation , no yearbook			1
the stated reason for the cancellations was security concerns ; that in such a tense racial atmosphere , a gathering such as a graduation ceremony or prom could become the target of an attack			1
yet many believe that the events were taken away as a punishment for their participation in the marches			0
if the authorities were truly concerned about the safety of the black students , they would not have met them with fire hoses and snarling dogs , said bishop @entity267 , director of the @entity0 chapter of the @entity269			1
it was @entity267 , who was a father with children at the schools , who sued to have graduation reinstated			1
a court eventually ordered graduation must go on , and it did , though delayed			2
@entity277 had her copper - colored dress ready to go when she left school to participate in the @entity190			0
and copper - colored shoes to match			0
they would go unworn , and be lost decades later in a tornado			0
" we marched down that street and we were singing ' we shall overcome , ' " @entity283 said			2
" you think back to it today , and it was truly worth it			0
" righting a wrong @entity291 has a line she uses when the topic of high school rites of passage and prom comes up : " we did n't have a prom because of the civil rights movement			1
" it puts the memory of 1963 in perspective and justifies the sacrifice			2
yet it does n't change the fact that inside , she has always lamented that she never had that night			0
sure , there were more important things going on in @entity0 at the time , but she was just a teenager and wanted those experiences			1
this time , @entity291 was on the " prom committee " that organized friday 's event			2
the small group gathered in a hotel room before the dance , laughing and reminiscing about the prom they never had			2
there would be no prom king and queen elected this time , but the theme of the dance summed up what the night was all about : " finally , the prom we never had			2
" @entity283 ironed her purple and gold dress as the women placed corsages on their wrists and waited for the limousines that would take them to the prom			2
amid the celebratory atmosphere , there were moments of reflection , and thoughts of those classmates who had passed away			0
in a way , this party was a celebration of what they had endured and survived over the last 50 years , @entity150 said			0
" as we get older , everything behind us looks greater , " she said			0
the prom committee held hands and said a prayer before walking out of the room			2
this would be their night			0
the prom was especially meaningful for @entity352 , as she and her high school sweetheart , @entity355 , had been negotiating with their parents for permission to attend the prom when it was canceled in 1963			1
they had been trying to figure out where to find transportation to the dance , and how to earn the money to rent formal wear or buy a dress			0
they later married , and when it came time for their children to attend proms , the couple put extra effort into making them special nights			2
it was n't until friday night , though , in @entity0 's @entity376 , that @entity377 was finally able to take his own sweetheart to the prom			1
" it 's really a much more pleasant event because we can afford the attire , we have no problem getting back and forth , " @entity377 said			0
" it makes you appreciate everything when we were children , " he continued			2
" the sacrifices people made			0
" @entity377 had attended rallies during the civil rights movement , but out of deference to his parents , he did not participate in the @entity190			0
the students that did participate in the march faced dogs and water and arrests , he said			0
" all we did was give up prom , " he said			0
opinion : historic milestone for @entity158 voters in 2012			0

on may 2 , 1963 , hundreds of @entity0 schoolchildren marched against segregation
images of children being hosed and intimidated by police dogs *sparked* national outrage
days later , the city canceled graduation and prom for seniors at five black high schools
while graduation was reinstated , prom never was -- until this *weekend*
