@entity0 , @entity1 -- they answered the call by the thousands , some walking miles in sweltering heat to volunteer to fight an @entity9 splinter group barreling towards the @entity1 capital			1
with reports that fighters with the @entity17 in @entity1 and @entity18 , the terror group also known as @entity15 , was some 40 miles from the gates of @entity0 , the country 's top religious and political leaders appealed for able - bodied men of fighting age to volunteer to defend the country			1
" @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 , wherever , by @entity26 's will we will be ready to defend any location , " said 23 - year - old @entity27 , who showed up thursday at a recruiting station in central @entity0 , one of dozens that have popped up across the country in recent days to handle the influx of volunteers			2
@entity27 , who gave only his first name , was joined by hundreds of men , mostly @entity37 in their 20s , at the @entity39 , where they waited under a makeshift canopy for their chance to sign up			2
" what 's happening is sabotage			0
those terrorists must be driven out , and by @entity46 they will be driven out , " he said			1
@entity15 ' lightning advance in @entity1 has been aided by support from many @entity49 who say they have been pushed aside and marginalized by prime minister @entity50 and his @entity37 - dominated government , a divide that threatens to tear the country apart			1
@entity15 , aided by @entity49 fighters , seized @entity1 's second - largest city , @entity23 , and then threatened to march on @entity0			1
the militants ' rapid advance -- and the total collapse of @entity1 's security forces in the face of their assault in @entity23 and a number of other smaller cities and towns -- have rocked @entity50 's government			1
while the aim of @entity15 is to establish an @entity69 state that stretches from @entity1 to northern @entity18 , where it has had significant success in battling @entity18 president @entity73 's forces , it has made @entity50 's removal from power part of its campaign			1
last week , as @entity15 fighters neared @entity79 , home to a revered @entity37 shrine , @entity50 took to the airwaves to call on volunteers to protect the city north of @entity0			1
that was followed by @entity1 's top cleric , @entity85 , appeal to people to join the military to protect @entity37 shrines , a call that saw a massive outpouring of @entity37 volunteers that raised concerns about the possible widening of the sectarian conflict			1
during friday prayers , a sermon delivered by a senior cleric and representative of @entity85 called for all @entity69 sects to stand together in the fight against @entity15			2
" last week , the higher religious authority called upon @entity1 to volunteer to join the armed forces to defend @entity1 in these difficult conditions , " @entity103 said during prayers in the @entity37 holy city of @entity106			1
" this call was directed to everybody and not to one sect , it aimed to prepare to stand up to @entity15 that has got the upper hand and strongest presence in many areas and that has declared that it is targeting other provinces including the holy @entity117 and @entity106 and other places within its reach like holy places and shrines of holy people and imams of all religions			2
" despite the widespread call , the volunteers signing up at the @entity39 were predominantly @entity37			1
" i volunteered to preserve the people , and as a response to request of @entity85 , " @entity129 , 25 , said			0
" we are here to serve the people , and get rid of @entity15			0
" every so often , an officer ticked off the names of 10 men on a list			0
each group headed into a beige , cramped building where they were give a cursory medical screening , including eye and dental exams			0
" they will call or text us , and then we will put on uniforms and go to the front line , " @entity129 said			0
the volunteers , who have been told they will receive a salary commiserate with soldiers in the @entity1 military , will get some training			2
it depends , gen. @entity153 said , on the " tactical situation			0
" " maybe a few days , maybe a month , " he said			0
with his medical exam completed , now @entity129 must wait			0
he says he 's not worried			0
" we are here with ... courage because we are here to drive out terrorism from this country			0
" @entity2 's @entity160 and @entity161 contributed to this report .			0
