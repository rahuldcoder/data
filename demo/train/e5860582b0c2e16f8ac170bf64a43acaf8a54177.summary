@entity0 -- the trial of deposed @entity4 president @entity3 got off to a raucous start monday , with a judge twice pausing what was supposed to be a brief opening hearing as @entity3 and his co-defendants loudly spoke over him , rejecting the charges and claiming @entity3 still is the rightful ruler			1
and the recesses were hardly calmer -- while the judge was away , journalists who were calling for @entity3 's execution argued with defense lawyers			1
a fight appeared to break out at one point			0
in the end , the judge adjourned the trial until january 8 so that lawyers could meet with their clients and sift through more than 5,000 pages of recently filed documents			1
but not before several wild scenes in the court , where more than 100 observers looked on			0
@entity3 helped set a tone of defiance when he walked in , wearing a suit as opposed to the white uniforms of his co-defendants			2
throughout , he refused to recognize the court 's legitimacy and made it clear he still considers himself president			2
" i warn everyone that what 's happening is a cover for the military coup , " he said shortly after the judge entered the room the first time			1
" i do n't want the great @entity4 judiciary to ever serve as a cover for the standing military coup			1
" the charges @entity3 appeared with seven co-defendants ; seven others are being tried in absentia			2
the charges stem from protests last december 5 over a constitution he shepherded into effect			0
@entity4 authorities have accused @entity3 and his staff of ordering supporters to attack protesters after guards and members of the @entity58 refused to do it			1
@entity3 , whom the military removed from office in a coup on july 3 , and four others are charged with inciting violence , but they are not accused of using force			1
the 11 others are charged with killing three men , torturing 54 people , using force and possessing weapons			0
defendants chant : ' down with military rule ' monday 's proceeding was unruly even before it began			1
before @entity3 and the judge entered the room , some of his seven co-defendants chanted " down with military rule " and " @entity3 is my president " from the dock			1
even some of the defense lawyers , who numbered more than 20 , chanted , " the people support the resilience of the president			0
" @entity3 became @entity4 's first freely elected president in 2012 after the overthrow of longtime strongman @entity89			1
the military deposed him in july , with detractors saying he was a tyrant trying to impose conservative values			0
supporters , including the @entity94 , have said the coup was a power grab by the military and elements of the old @entity89 regime			2
after @entity3 made his statement at the start of monday 's proceeding , the judge asked if the defendants were present -- and they did n't answer			1
when the judge addressed the defense lawyers , @entity3 spoke up again and things broke down			2
" i am dr. @entity3 , the president of the republic , " @entity3 said			2
" the coup is a crime and ... treason			0
" this led to chaos , with a number of people -- lawyers , journalists , the judge -- trying to speak at once , and @entity3 repeating himself to make sure he was heard			0
with no one able to hear anyone clearly , the judge called a recess for more than an hour			0
upon returning , the judge let the prosecutor present the charges			0
several defendants responded to the charges by proclaiming they rejected the court			0
the second recess came after more commotion , after @entity3 alleged the court was n't properly specialized to charge @entity4 's president			1
the judge never returned to the courtroom : he sent a court official after the second recess to announce the adjournment until january 8			0
pro-morsy demonstrators outside court outside the police academy where the trial was being held , more than 100 pro-morsy demonstrators faced a cordon of security forces behind barbed wire			0
the demonstrators waved flags and chanted loudly against the military , which deposed @entity3 four months ago , and against @entity4 's interim government			1
some protesters attacked television news crews they claimed were not reporting the truth , but that incident was brief			1
several hundred people have died in clashes between @entity151 demonstrators and security forces since the military removed him			0
authorities have warned they will crack down on any violent protests tied to the trial			0
constitutional claim defense lawyer @entity157 told @entity1 that @entity3 's team will argue that it is illegal under the constitution approved under @entity3 to try a president without approval of two - thirds of the members of the parliament			1
the military suspended that constitution , but the court could honor it , @entity157 said			0
@entity3 had been held at an undisclosed location since the coup			2
@entity171 has described his detention as an " enforced disappearance			0
" after monday 's hearing , @entity3 will be taken to the @entity178 - @entity177 prison in @entity179 , state - run tv reported			1
state - run @entity174 reported that @entity3 was transported by military plane to the court			1
the other defendants were transported by military armored vehicles			0
who represents @entity3 ? it was n't immediately clear after monday 's proceedings whether @entity3 will accept the lawyer provided to him , as accepting legal representation could be perceived as acceptance of the court and the trial			1
@entity3 's @entity192 , the political wing of the @entity94 , assigned lawyer @entity194 to him			2
@entity194 argued monday that the court does n't have jurisdiction to try @entity3 , and that @entity3 is illegally held -- asserting that anything gleaned during his detention would be null and void			2
lawyer @entity199 , who represents victims of the december clashes , repeatedly argued that this is n't a political trial -- saying she 'd been working on the case since december , months before @entity3 's ouster			1
