when can a government kill its own people ? the straightforward question has anything but a simple answer , especially for the government of a nation founded on inalienable rights to life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness			0
monday 's news that the @entity14 administration is considering a military hit on an @entity17 terrorist raises anew the issue of what justifies such a step , according to both the law and the public conscience in an era of political , social and technological evolution			1
" @entity17 's legitimate claim of self - defense can not be the end of the discussion , " president @entity14 said last year when he announced new guidelines on drone strikes that target enemies for killing			1
" to say a military tactic is legal , or even effective , is not to say it is wise or moral in every instance			0
for the same human progress that gives us the technology to strike half a world away also demands the discipline to constrain that power -- or risk abusing it			0
" the @entity43 contends the administration abuses its power , particularly when it comes to drone strikes that have targeted foreigners and in some cases , @entity17 citizens			1
" even in the context of an armed conflict against an armed group , the government may use lethal force only against individuals who are directly participating in hostilities against the @entity17 , " the group says on its website			2
" regardless of the context , whenever the government uses lethal force , it must take all possible steps to avoid harming civilian bystanders			0
but these are not the standards that the executive branch is using			0
" here are questions about what the government is doing , with explanation of why and arguments against : 1 ) what does targeted killing mean , and how widespread is it ? after the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks on the @entity17 , a traumatized nation responded with new laws that greatly expanded the government 's power to fight terrorism			1
wars were launched in @entity80 and then @entity81 , and the national intelligence system expanded to new capacity disclosed in last year 's classified leaks by former @entity87 contractor @entity85			0
part of the expanded powers included legal authorization to target terrorists defined as enemies of the state -- people determined to be fighting a war against @entity17			2
the @entity96 and the military have used drones and covert missions to take out such targets , including drone strikes that killed @entity17 citizen @entity102 , a wanted terrorist , and three other @entity17			1
unofficial estimates based on reports by human rights groups and media accounts indicate the @entity14 administration has carried out hundreds of drone strikes that have killed hundreds and perhaps thousands of people , including terrorists and civilians , in an escalation of the practice started by the @entity115 administration			1
most have occurred in @entity80 , but others have taken place in countries where no ground war was occurring including @entity120 , where @entity102 and the two other @entity17 died in 2011			1
2 ) is it legal for the government to target and kill people ? in his may 2013 speech at the @entity124 , @entity14 proclaimed the practice completely legal			2
" under domestic law , and international law , the @entity17 is at war with @entity129 , the @entity130 , and their associated forces , " he said			2
" we are at war with an organization that right now would kill as many @entity17 as they could if we did not stop them first			2
so this is a just war -- a war waged proportionally , in last resort , and in self - defense			0
" critics , however , say the government oversteps the legal boundaries of the @entity143 and international law , particularly by making decisions on targeted killings in secret without going before any court			1
" the result is that the public remains in the dark about how exactly @entity17 policy governing targeted killings is operating , under which legal authorities , and who exactly are its victims , " said a letter to @entity14 in december from nine rights groups			1
@entity159 , who directs the @entity43 's @entity160 , told @entity161 that the @entity14 administration was " fighting hard " to prevent a judicial review of the strikes that killed @entity102 and the other @entity17 , including the terrorist 's 16 - year - old son			1
until allegations in classified documents can be assessed in court , she said , the question of whether they amount to real evidence remains unanswered			0
@entity173 called the @entity17 actions " one of the most extreme and dangerous forms of authority that the executive branch can claim -- the power to kill people based on vague and shifting legal standards , secret evidence and no judicial review even after the fact			1
" in 2010 , a federal judge in @entity186 noted the government would need permission from a federal court to wiretap @entity102 , but that no such court process existed in order to kill him			2
rejecting an effort by @entity102 's father to block his son 's possible extrajudicial killing , @entity17 district judge @entity192 called it " somewhat unsettling " that a president could -- for national security reasons -- make a unilateral decision to kill a @entity17 citizen overseas and the decision would be " judicially unreviewable			1
" 3 ) even if it is legal by the letter of the law , is it morally or politically right ? @entity14 has insisted his responsibility as commander in chief to protect @entity17 from attack justified targeted killings like the drone strike on @entity102			1
in his speech last may , he rejected targeting an @entity17 citizen without what he called " due process , " meaning adherence to full legal procedures			2
then he explained the reasoning for the @entity218 hit two years earlier , before the expanded policy guidelines he was announcing			0
" when a @entity17 citizen goes abroad to wage war against @entity17 and is actively plotting to kill @entity17 citizens , and when neither the @entity17 , nor our partners are in a position to capture him before he carries out a plot , his citizenship should no more serve as a shield than a sniper shooting down on an innocent crowd should be protected from a swat team , " @entity14 said , citing @entity102 by name			1
" i would have detained and prosecuted @entity102 if we captured him before he carried out a plot , but we could n't , " @entity14 continued			1
" and as president , i would have been derelict in my duty had i not authorized the strike that took him out			2
" @entity173 , who argued the @entity43 's federal court case seeking judicial review of the strikes on @entity102 and two other @entity17 , contended that the government has failed to adhere to the oversight it set up for targeted killings			1
" policy restrictions are well and good , but the administration appears to have gone well beyond them based on the investigate reports of human rights organizations and media accounts , " she said monday			0
4 ) does it work ? ever the politician , @entity14 argued forcefully last year that targeted killings were a necessary tool in the expanding battle against international terrorism			1
" dozens of highly skilled @entity129 commanders , trainers , bomb makers and operatives have been taken off the battlefield , " he said			0
" plots have been disrupted that would have targeted international aviation , @entity17 transit systems , @entity271 cities and our troops in @entity80			2
simply put , these strikes have saved lives			0
" critics , including congressional @entity277 , argue the president 's anti-terrorism strategy , which in many ways extended programs and practices started after the 9/11 attacks under the @entity115 administration , have failed to effectively curtail @entity129			1
asked last week at a congressional hearing if @entity129 was stronger or weaker today than before the 9/11 attacks , director of national intelligence @entity287 struggled to find an answer before conceding the terrorist network now was more widespread and therefore more difficult to combat			0
at the same hearing , @entity293 chairman @entity292 argued that tighter restrictions on targeted killings announced by @entity14 in last year 's policy speech had weakened the government 's fight against terrorism			1
" today , individuals who would have been previously removed from the battlefield by @entity17 counter-terrorism operations for attacking or plotting to attack against @entity17 interests remain free because of self - imposed red tape , " the @entity306 @entity277 said , adding that " the president 's may 2013 policy changes for the @entity17 targeted strikes are an utter and complete failure , and they leave @entity17 ' lives at risk			1
" however , the criticism by @entity292 differs from @entity173 's accusation that the administration fails to adhere to the stated policies of increased oversight and following due process			0
@entity292 complained that the problem involved confusion over the @entity17 policies			0
5 ) is it worth it ? to @entity14 , the need to take out war enemies supersedes the potential political fallout at home and abroad over drone strikes and other targeted killings			1
he argued last year that doing nothing would invite " far more civilian casualties " by terrorists targeting @entity17 cities as well as foreign strongholds in @entity120 , @entity80 , @entity335 and elsewhere			0
" remember that the terrorists we are after target civilians , and the death toll from their acts of terrorism against @entity343 dwarfs any estimate of civilian casualties from drone strikes , " he argued , saying that " doing nothing is not an option			0
" @entity14 also contended the drone strikes were less risky than conventional weapons or " boots on the ground " in terms of collateral damage and broader political repercussions			2
" it is false to assert that putting boots on the ground is less likely to result in civilian deaths or less likely to create enemies in the @entity360 world , " he said , referring to unpopular @entity17 military incidents of recent decades			0
" the results would be more @entity17 deaths , more @entity363 down , more confrontations with local populations , and an inevitable mission creep in support of such raids that could easily escalate into new wars			0
" on the ground , though , drone strikes that kill civilians evoke rage and resentment against the @entity17 that can breed more anti-american activism			2
to @entity173 , the threat also is to core @entity17 values back home			0
" there 's enough credible reporting about tragic wrongful killings and mistakes having been made , " she told @entity161			0
" it helps neither the security of the @entity17 nor the victims of its policies , because in the end , long - term national security depends on our real commitment to our laws and our values			0
