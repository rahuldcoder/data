@entity0 -- the @entity5 has yanked the security clearances of 11 members accused of bringing prostitutes to a hotel in @entity10 ahead of last week 's @entity12 summit , government officials with knowledge of the investigation said monday			1
the investigation also involves at least five and possibly 10 @entity15 military personnel who were working with the @entity5 ahead of president @entity17 's trip to the @entity18			1
they are accused of bringing prostitutes to their @entity21 hotel wednesday night , and the chairman of the @entity23 said monday his personnel " let the boss down " with their conduct			1
the @entity5 agents and officers involved range in experience from relative newcomers to nearly 20 - year veterans , and all have been interviewed at least once , two government officials with knowledge of the probe told @entity1			1
their security clearances have been pulled while an investigation is under way and could be reinstated if they are cleared , the officials said			1
most if not all arrived in @entity21 on wednesday , two days before @entity17 , and went out for drinks in several groups after arrival , the officials said			0
the agency , which is responsible for presidential security , has briefed key congressional leaders on the investigation so far			2
rep. @entity48 , the chairman of the @entity49 , told @entity1 that he believed 11 prostitutes were brought back to the hotel			1
over the weekend , @entity48 told @entity1 that one of the women refused to leave a hotel room thursday morning			2
a hotel manager tried to get in the room , and eventually the woman emerged and said " they owed her money , " according to @entity48			2
@entity15 government sources also said there was a dispute between at least one @entity5 member and a woman demanding payment			1
at least one of the women brought to the hotel talked with police , and complaints were filed with the @entity15 embassy , the sources said			2
the alleged misconduct occurred before @entity17 arrived in @entity21 , but the news broke while he was there			2
gen. @entity77 , chairman of the @entity23 , told reporters at the @entity79 on monday that the incident distracted attention " from what was a very important regional engagement for our president			1
" " so we let the boss down , because nobody 's talking about what went on in @entity10 other than this incident , " @entity77 said			2
rep. @entity90 , the chairman of the @entity91 , said he met with @entity5 director @entity92 on monday and said @entity92 was " shocked " by the accusations			1
" this is an organization with a great history , a history of being disciplined , " @entity90 , @entity94 , told @entity1 's " @entity97			0
" but he said earlier that " to assume that 11 people did something on a one - time basis is a little bit questionable			0
" for 11 people to violate a basic security premise indicates a larger problem , @entity90 said			2
the @entity15 do n't seem to have broken the law in @entity10 , where soliciting prostitutes is legal in some parts of the country , he said			0
but the congressman -- a leading @entity17 administration critic -- said the conduct could have posed a security risk to the president by exposing @entity5 agents to blackmail			1
" what 's legal in one country still could lead to a married man being blackmailed , " he said			0
speaking at the end of the summit on sunday , @entity17 called for a " thorough " and " rigorous " investigation into the allegations			0
" we 're representing the people of the @entity15 , and when we travel to another country , i expect us to observe the highest standards , " he said			0
" obviously , what 's been reported does n't match up with those standards			0
" but he added , " i 'll wait until the full investigation is completed until i pass final judgment			0
" the @entity79 said monday that the misconduct involved more service members than the five initially believed			1
@entity79 spokesman @entity128 could not say how many more might be involved , but he indicated the personnel might come from more than one branch of the military			1
@entity79 officials had originally thought only @entity134 personnel were involved			1
" we believe there may be more than five , " @entity128 said monday			0
all were expected to return to the @entity15 on monday			0
@entity128 said the personnel were not directly involved in presidential security and did not have any contact with @entity17			1
he defined their role as in " support " of the @entity5			1
because presidential security was the overall mission , however , it is not clear whether the @entity79 will ever publicly describe what the military personnel were doing as part of their work in @entity10 or what branches of the military they belonged to			1
an officer who was already in @entity10 gathered initial facts , according to @entity128			0
a more senior officer was leaving for @entity10 on monday to continue the investigation			0
@entity5 spokesman @entity154 said the agents were relieved of duty thursday , before the president 's arrival in @entity10			2
the agency 's assistant director , @entity159 , noted his agency 's " zero tolerance policy on personal misconduct			0
" " this incident is not reflective of the behavior of our personnel as they travel every day throughout the country and the world performing their duties in a dedicated , professional manner , " @entity159 said saturday			0
" we regret any distraction from the @entity18 this situation has caused			0
