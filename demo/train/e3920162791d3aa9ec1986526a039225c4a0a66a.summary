-- @entity3 was " relieved of his duties " as manager of @entity5 friday just 11 days after being told by the @entity9 club 's @entity7 owner @entity6 he must resign or be sacked			1
a statement on the club 's official website confirmed the fate of the 41 - year - old @entity14 , adding that a new first team manager would be appointed in due course			0
the departure of @entity3 was widely expected after his very public falling out with billionaire businessman @entity6 , who has had a controlling share in the @entity20 club since 2010			1
@entity6 sent @entity3 an email on december 16 , with the resign or be sacked ultimatum			2
he criticized @entity3 's signings and the team 's style of play and said he would be given no further funds in the next transfer window			0
@entity6 's intervention infuriated @entity5 fans , who were out in force in matches against @entity33 and @entity34 during the @entity36 period to protest over their manager 's treatment			1
after the 4 - 1 defeat to @entity33 , @entity3 was given a brief reprieve when club chairman @entity41 said he would remain the manager for the " forseeable future			0
" but the 3 - 0 home defeat to @entity34 proved his final match in charge as he becomes the sixth @entity9 manager to depart this season			1
@entity3 was appointed by @entity6 in the summer of 2011 , a year after the @entity7 took control and success came on the pitch with an appearance in the 2012 @entity54 final at @entity55			1
@entity5 narrowly missed out in the playoffs to secure promotion , but made no mistake last season by winning the second - flight championship			0
off the field , while the @entity5 fans welcomed @entity6 's investment into the club , there were protests when he changed the club 's traditional blue strip -- they are nicknamed the @entity68 -- to red			2
the majority appear to have been behind @entity3 during the recent saga and there were several " @entity75 " banners unfurled at the @entity34 game			0
the defeat left @entity5 in 16th place , one point above the relegation zone and the new manager -- former @entity82 star @entity81 is the early favorite -- will be judged on their ability to avoid the drop .			0
