-- @entity2 's exit from @entity3 is a reminder that the @entity6 awakening will not just fizzle out , despite what some observers are saying			1
recently , commentators pointed to the public cheers heard in @entity11 as the army pushed protesters out of @entity14 as a signal that the uprisings were petering out and the hope of the @entity18 would soon be lost			1
indeed , the uprisings are entering a difficult but inevitable phase where the two sides -- the protesters and the leaders -- are at a loss on how to proceed			2
the protesters , on one hand , still have no leadership and have yet to translate their protests into any coherent political and economic reform program			1
with initial objectives in @entity11 and @entity3 met -- the overthrow of dictators that ruled over them for years -- they have not been able to move into the next phase of building an alternative system of governance			1
their message is dying out , and regular people , who are relieved that @entity40 and @entity42 @entity41 are gone , want to see their countries move beyond street protests that are starting to upset their already difficult economic situations			2
this is what lies ahead in @entity3			2
on the other hand , the one party able to lead a gradual reform process -- ironically the ruling elite , such as the military in @entity11 -- is largely unwilling to embark on a process that would slowly rid itself of its privileges and install a pluralistic , stable and prosperous system based on merit rather than patronage			2
no one should be surprised by this			0
ruling establishments in the @entity6 world have always made sure that political parties and civil society organizations are either suppressed or outlawed			1
there are few alternative leaders and systems			0
in such an atmosphere , organized parties like the @entity68 , which commands about 20 % of the popular vote in @entity11 , will be sure to use their organizational and mobilization skills to gain political representation that will exceed their popular strength			1
the ruling elite , fearful of this , will naturally resist opening up political systems and resort to economic and security measures in a desperate attempt to stem the tide of change			2
but the only way to deal with opposition parties that are not totally committed to democracy is to gradually open up the political systems to real alternatives , instead of casting all protest votes against the ruling systems in favor of the @entity91			1
after the @entity6 public has a sense of what freedom feels like , it will not accept the replacement of secular autocrats by religious ones			1
it would be wrong to assume that because of these difficulties , the uprisings will fizzle or die down			2
what has taken place in the @entity6 world is the start of a genuine and permanent process of change where the average citizen suddenly discovered real power			1
although the ability to effect change peacefully is a new phenomenon in the @entity6 world , it is a wave that will only grow			1
organizations such as @entity115 are the first to lose , having unsuccessfully preached violence			0
but so will ruling establishments , if they do n't internalize the new reality and lead a serious reform process that redistributes power among the executive , legislative and judicial branches			1
the only way to keep power in the @entity6 world from now on will be to share it			1
the process of change is one that will take decades to unfold , it wo n't be linear , and it will undergo many seasons , multiple times over			0
during a recent trip to @entity132 , i was most struck by a young generation no longer afraid to talk about all the issues relating to their future , and talk openly without taboos			0
this generation is not willing to live by the rules their parents faced , nor afraid of the powerful intelligence services in making their views known			0
both sides are wrong , however , to stick to tactics that do n't work anymore			0
protesters need to start organizing themselves into political parties , develop programs and build constituencies			1
they need to shift from starting change to institutionalizing it			0
otherwise , they will be unable to maintain public support			0
ruling elites should n't conclude that the status quo can be maintained because public support for protests seems to be wavering			0
they need to understand that they can not push aside opposition parties like the @entity68 , act as if they do n't exist or deal with them through security measures			0
both ruling establishments and the protesters need to know that they have to engage in constituent politics			0
even with a quick change in @entity3 , the short - term future will be messy , very bumpy and undoubtedly feature lots of mistakes and missteps			0
but waiting and doing nothing is no longer an option			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity173 .			2

@entity173 : doomsayers who say @entity18 is petering out are wrong ; it is irreversible
@entity173 : elites and protesters are at an *impasse* , need to move toward *consensus* building
protesters need political parties and programs , he says , and elites must reform
it will be hard , he says , but the only way ahead in the @entity6 world is a sharing of power
