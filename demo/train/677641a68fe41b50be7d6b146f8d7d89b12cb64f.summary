@entity0 -- a man is in critical condition at a hospital after jumping out of a monorail car into the @entity9 's tiger pit , the zoo 's director said			1
the man -- believed to be about 25 -- was riding on the zoo 's @entity12 monorail around 3 p.m. friday when he jumped out of his car , " clearing the exhibit 's perimeter fence , " according to statement from @entity9 director @entity18			1
the facility emergency response staff arrived and used a carbon dioxide fire extinguisher to move a tiger away from the man , @entity18 said			1
but they did not get there before the man had suffered multiple puncture wounds after being bitten by a tiger , @entity1 affiliates @entity23 and @entity24 reported , citing police			2
heeding instructions , the man then rolled " under a hot wire to safety , " the zoo director said			1

if the animal comes into contact with the wire , it feels a small electric shock			0

he was " conscious and talking " as he was taken , by ambulance , to nearby @entity55			0
the man was in critical condition at the hospital , according to a @entity60 spokesman , who was not named per department policy			1

@entity18 said the tiger will not be put down as it " did nothing wrong			0
" " this is just an extraordinary occurrence that happened because ... somebody was deliberately trying to endanger themselves , " he said			0
