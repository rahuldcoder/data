you may have heard it before : billions of years ago , @entity2 probably looked more like @entity3 does now , with clouds and oceans and a much thicker atmosphere			2
it may even have had some type of microbes			0
but now it 's a barren , frozen desert			0
so what happened ? where did the air and water go ? that 's what the spacecraft @entity17 launched monday is being dispatched to find out			1
it 's called @entity20 -- short for @entity20 -- and it 's the first mission dedicated to studying the red planet 's upper atmosphere			1
" we expect to learn how the modern @entity2 works , really in detail			0
to see its climate state , to understand how the atmosphere is lost to space -- how @entity2 may have lost a magnetic field -- to take that information and map it back in time , " said @entity17 's @entity26			1
@entity20 lifted off shortly before 1:30 p.m. et from @entity32 in @entity33 , starting a 10 - month trip			0
by late afternoon , it was more than 14,000 miles from @entity3 en route to a september 22 , 2014 rendezvous with @entity2			1
the solar - powered probe is about the length of school bus -- 37.5 feet ( 11.43 meters ) -- and will weigh about 5,410 pounds ( 2,454 kilograms ) at launch			0
what killed @entity2 ? new spacecraft will find out " @entity20 will fill in a very big gap in our understanding of the planet by exploring the upper atmosphere and its influence on the @entity2 environment , " principal investigator @entity53 , from the @entity54 , says on his @entity17 webpage			1
he says he 's " excited that we 're providing one step along the path of answering questions about whether life ever existed on @entity2			2
" @entity53 's team will use the spacecraft 's three instrument suites in hopes of determining three things about @entity2 : the composition of its upper atmosphere how fast it 's losing what 's left of its atmosphere the history of the atmosphere @entity20 wo n't make a cool , daring landing like the @entity76 , which has been roaming @entity2 for more than a year now			1
instead , it will orbit between a low of about 93 miles ( 150 kilometers ) above the surface to a high of about 3,728 miles ( 6,000 kilometers )			0
it also will make five dives , flying as low as 77 miles ( 125 kilometers ) in altitude			0
@entity17 says the mission will cost $ 671 million			2
interactive : @entity2 exploration from @entity84 to @entity20			2

@entity20 logs more than 14,000 miles on its first day , @entity17 says
the *unmanned* probe is en route to @entity2 to study the red planet 's atmosphere
the mission launched monday afternoon ; it 's *scheduled* to arrive in september 2014
