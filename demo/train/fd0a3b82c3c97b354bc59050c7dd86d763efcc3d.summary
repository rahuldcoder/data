@entity1 @entity0 admitted friday to violating his probation by getting arrested in @entity3 -- an admission his lawyer hopes will gain his freedom soon			1
@entity0 , 25 , wore an orange jail jumpsuit and handcuffs , but he appeared to be smiling as he was led into court in @entity10 by deputies friday afternoon			1
the singer has been in custody for two months and in court - ordered rehab five months before that while awaiting a probation revocation trial			1
but with that trial on hold because of a delay in his @entity3 assault case , @entity0 lawyer @entity16 decided it would be better to settle the case sooner and not later			1
@entity24 judge @entity23 immediately sentenced @entity0 to serve 365 days in jail for the admitted probation violation			2
he was given credit for serving 234 days because of the rehab and jail time , leaving 131 days left to serve			2
but @entity0 's lawyer told @entity31 that he expects @entity32 to be released from custody by the county sheriff within the next week			1
" i would expect that @entity0 should be out of jail before the weekend 's up or before monday , " @entity16 said after the hearing			1
" if he is n't out by monday , then i would expect he 's getting special treatment			0
he 's got over 230 days credit on a 365 ( day sentence ) and generally the sheriff is releasing on a lot less than that			0
" @entity0 's probation for the 2009 beating of ex-girlfriend @entity46 was revoked after his arrest in connection to a misdemeanor assault charge out of @entity3 friday 's admission in @entity10 that he violated his probation by committing a crime in @entity3 should lead to a quick resolution of the @entity3 assault case , @entity16 said			2
@entity0 still must complete about 700 hours of community labor at a rate of three days a week once he is released from jail			2
@entity16 , however , said @entity0 has " enjoyed " the work because it is " at a facility that has allowed to him to kind of expand his horizons			0
" his probation office calculated that his probation , which began in august 2009 , should end on january 23 , 2015			0
until then , he must attend several anger management and family counseling sessions each week and submit to random drug tests the judge said			0
friday 's resolution is a relief for @entity0 after languishing in jail for the past two months , his lawyer said			1
" we 're gratified that he was not sentenced to state prison , gratified that he 's still on probation , " @entity16 said			0
" i think that @entity0 has learned quite a bit through this experience and i 'm anxious to see how he does , as i think everybody else is			0
" @entity0 's ' @entity79 ' trip to @entity10			0
