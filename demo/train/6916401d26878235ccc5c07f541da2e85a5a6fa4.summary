" @entity11 spokesman @entity55 says the humanitarian agency delivered a water buffalo to this settlement , about 20 miles west of @entity59 , but nothing else arrived until the mattresses on sunday			2

in @entity0 , at the epicenter of the massive quake , about 85 percent of the town may have been destroyed			1
@entity97 , @entity98 ambassador to @entity1 , told @entity2 's @entity99 on sunday that the relief was slow in the first few days			1
" it was very slow , a lot came in , it was hard to get it out to the people who needed it most , " he said			0
" if i were a @entity1 here , i would be , frankly , angry at the whole situation i found myself in			1
but i must say that i think the @entity1 are resilient , and they 're to be applauded for approaching this in a stoic and dignified fashion			1

" more than 500 aid agencies are operating in @entity1			1
fifteen of them met with @entity0 officials saturday to address needs			1
the @entity135 plans to set up a separate water and sanitation system for @entity0 , but the world organization is " quite stretched , " said @entity139 , senior emergency specialist with @entity11			1
" it 's hard to imagine how it could be worse , " he said about @entity0 's sanitation problems			2

she clutches her printed floral mattress made in @entity1 -- @entity11 says it tries its best to promote local manufacturers rather than ship in goods from other nations -- and a blanket sent by the @entity181			2
one , maybe two , of her children might sleep a little better tonight .			0
