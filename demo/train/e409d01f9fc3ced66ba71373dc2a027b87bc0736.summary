-- @entity1 will miss the @entity2 after the reigning champion could n't recover in time from a right wrist injury			1
the world @entity5 injured his wrist after @entity8 and pulled out of the recent masters events in @entity11 and @entity12			0
due to make an announcement over the weekend about his participation at @entity17 , that decision was pushed back to monday and the @entity19 's fans were ultimately left disappointed with the outcome			2
" i am very sorry to announce i wo n't be able to play at this year 's @entity2 , " the 28 - year - old announced on his @entity23 page			1
" i am sure you understand that it is a very tough moment for me since it is a tournament i love and where i have great memories from fans , the night matches , so many things			0
" ( there is ) not much more i can do right now , other than accept the situation and , as always in my case , work hard in order to be able to compete at the highest level once i am back			0
" it 's not the first time @entity1 wo n't be able to defend a grand slam title			1
he also skipped @entity8 in 2009 , the year after his memorable triumph over @entity41 at the @entity42 , when his knees were the issue			0
injuries have been an ever present in the 14 - time grand slam winner 's career , with those knees the biggest culprit			2
but a hamstring injury hindered @entity1 at the @entity51 -- when he was on the verge of capturing a fourth consecutive grand slam titles -- and in @entity54 seven months ago , back pain meant he was unable to perform at his best in the finale versus @entity57			1
his absence means @entity41 will be bumped up to no. 2 in the seedings , only behind @entity61			0
@entity41 has been the hottest player this summer , reaching the final in @entity11 and winning @entity12 , and without his nemesis at the @entity2 , the @entity64 ' chances of landing a record - extending 18th major have now improved			2
@entity1 is the highest profile casualty of the @entity2 , though 2009 champion @entity68 also withdrew with a wrist injury			1
the tournament begins next monday .			0
