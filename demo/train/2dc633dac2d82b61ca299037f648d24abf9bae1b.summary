-- @entity1 is a decidedly modern invention , but back in your great - great - great - great - great - great grandparents ' day , " @entity6 " were the functional equivalent			1
photochroms combined emerging photographic technology and the painterly techniques of the old masters to provide technicolor glimpses of the @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 , and @entity15			1
these dreamlike vistas have been collected for the first time in a volume called an @entity20 odyssey by @entity21 and @entity22 ©			1
the oversize , $ 200 book is a sampling of the 100,000 @entity6 created by the @entity26 between the company 's formation in 1888 and its closure in 1924			1
the @entity30 @entity30 photographers would start the process by coating a printing plate with a light - sensitive emulsion and then exposing a glass plate photo negative onto it			2
unlike modern four - color printing process that can represent millions of colors by overlapping tiny dots of cyan , magenta , yellow , and black ink , the inks mixed for @entity6 were mixed by hand in an attempt to perfectly match the yellow - green sunblasted scrub brush that surrounds the @entity48 or the aquamarine ocean water of the @entity50			2
the photographers would erase the entire plate except for the area reserved for that specific color and make 10 - 15 more plates to fill out the composition			0
photographic details were preserved , but an emotive , if slightly artificial , range of color was added			1
the @entity26 toured large @entity6 on trains and the @entity60 supercharged their spread by passing a law that allowed @entity64 postcards to be sent for a penny , rather than the going rate of two cents			0
like the locomotives of that era , labor - intensive @entity6 lost steam as the first color film debuted in 1907 , and @entity71 made color snapshots widely available with the release of @entity75 cameras in 1935			0
however , as a testament to the charm of the technique , the last @entity30 factory did n't close its doors until 1970			0
an @entity20 @entity19 is available from @entity81			0
