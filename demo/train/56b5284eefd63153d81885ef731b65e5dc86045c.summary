gone are the days when all @entity2 's high - end dining had to offer was a white tablecloth in a stuffy setting			1
@entity2 's dining room democratization is none more apparent than in the explosion of " no reservations " restaurants -- reservations are n't accepted , walk - ins only			1
though critics lament the need to stand around for hours waiting for a table , the concept works for those in the city on business who have n't had a chance to secure a seat at one of the city 's best eateries			0
here are a few of @entity2 's best no - reservations restaurants			1
@entity26 no - reservation restaurants are n't new to @entity2 , but the trend did n't go mainstream until restaurateur @entity30 opened his first @entity32 restaurant in @entity33 in 2009			1
since then , he 's had five more openings around @entity2			1
our pick of the bunch is @entity26			0
this is n't your average @entity2 @entity40 establishment -- @entity26 is more sinatra than @entity42			1
diners can expect simple dishes done just right , like chickpeas and squid ink , lamb and pickled sliders and chocolate , pecan and whisky cake			1
the industrial , postmodern ambiance is reminiscent of @entity55 's @entity54			1
the result is refreshing for a city that , until a few years ago , was in desperate need of a fresh injection of cool			0
@entity26 , 61 rupert st. , @entity33 @entity61 on the one hand , you have a chef who 's trained under culinary luminaries such as @entity66 , @entity67 and @entity68			1
on the other , you have a sommelier whose previous work experience includes serving at global legends @entity72 and @entity73			1
put them together and do you get just another cliched fine dining place ? not a chance			0
this husband - and - wife team is the rage of @entity2 's food scene right now for their @entity61 -- a champagne bar serving @entity55 - style gourmet hot dogs			1
highlights are the @entity84 ( filled with kimchi , fermented red bean paste and lettuce ) and breakie dogs , made with fried egg , tomato relish and black pudding bits			1
@entity92 , 70 @entity93 st. , @entity94 ; +44 20 7637 7770 @entity95 it 's said that in @entity100 's @entity99 region , everyone can cook well			0
whether or not that 's true , the cooking of executive chef @entity102 , who comes from a town near @entity104 , is up there with the best of @entity109 's pintxos bar chefs			1
this brainchild of brothers @entity112 and @entity113 is like a visit to your favorite @entity116 tapas bar			2
since 2007 , customers have been queuing up for hours over glasses of wine to eat some of the most iconic dishes in @entity2 , including the oozy classic tortilla , octopus with capers and @entity125 ( pork shoulder )			1
hard - to - find ingredients and long hours of prep are the secrets to the restaurant 's success			2
do n't bother buying their cookbook -- we can assure you it 's less painful to wait in line at @entity95 than to try to cook some of its best - loved dishes yourself			2
@entity95 , 54 frith st. , @entity33 ; +44 20 7813 8016 @entity141 not as well known as @entity95 , this fellow @entity33 tapas bar is by no means inferior			2
@entity141 , with its @entity145 ambiance , serves slightly modern versions of tapas , but the tastes remain unmistakably @entity149			0
the menu changes daily , keeping regulars coming back , while favorite items are ever - present			2
the venison , girolles and truffled mash , and the pork belly bun , courgette and chili , are both recommended			0
however , the star of the show is the savory ajo blanco and beetroot -- a cold @entity149 soup made with garlic and almonds			0
@entity141 offers a great selection of @entity167 by the glass			0
though @entity141 wo n't accept bookings for dinner , those who want to guarantee a lunch spot can reserve online			0
@entity141 , 26 d'arblay st. , @entity33 ; +44 20 7287 7797 @entity173 hailed for kick - starting the southern @entity175 bbq trend in @entity2 , @entity173 was born on the streets of @entity177 , where its slow cooked , smoky and succulent meats have long been fixture items for 20 - something @entity180 who work around the area			1
led by @entity184 ( @entity185 and @entity186 ) and his friend , @entity187 , the restaurant moved to a new , permanent home in @entity33 in 2012			0
fortunately , the quality has n't diminished			0
highlights include blackened fall - off - the - bone @entity193 ribs and tender pulled pork			2
@entity196 , @entity197 st. , @entity33 ; +44 20 7287 5578 barnyard located in the heart of @entity201 , and the newest restaurant on this list , @entity199 is the brainchild of the young and talented @entity205 of @entity207 - starred @entity206			2
the concept is simple : comfort food in an unpretentious setting without having to book six months in advance ( which is the case of @entity206 ' first venue )			0
diners get deceptively simple dishes like sausage in a bun with burned onions , or crispy chicken wings with smoked paprika , garlic and lemon			2
with chef @entity205 at the helm , the flavors are anything but ordinary			0
other menu stars include roast suckling pig with gooseberry relish and the not - to - be - missed dessert , popcorn ice cream with smoked fudge sauce			0
@entity199 , 18 @entity93 st. , @entity94 ; +44 20 7580 3842			0

@entity173 is *credited* with bringing southern @entity175 bbq to @entity2 diners
current @entity2 *hotspot* @entity61 is a champagne bar serving @entity55 - style gourmet hot dogs
