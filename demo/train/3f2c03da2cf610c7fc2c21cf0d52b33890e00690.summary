-- as the story goes , in 2010 there was a dramatic political course correction			0
the electorate that just two years earlier had overwhelmingly voted for hope and change , sweeping @entity7 into office , up and down the ballot , across the country , had buyers ' remorse			0
@entity13 changed its mind after 2008 and broke hard for the tea party , building a wave that would devastate @entity7			1
at least that 's the conventional lazy narrative about the 2010 midterm elections			0
that narrative draws a picture of a tea party wave that swept @entity22 to victory on the back of a set of conservative policies in reaction to president @entity28 and @entity7			1
as often is the case with @entity30 , reality and spin are n't necessarily on the same page			0
reality is actually a little different ; well no , it 's actually really , really different than the @entity21 wave narrative would have you believe			0
and as we are a few weeks out from the 2014 midterm elections where many believe @entity7 are poised once again to be battered into oblivion by another @entity21 wave , it 's important to dissect what happened in 2010 and why there is a possibility that this time might be a little different from what conventional wisdom is trying to tell you			1
the 2010 tea party wave is a lie			1
in truth , if you look at the enormous drops in voter participation from 2008 or 2012 in comparison with 2010 , instead of referring to it as the " 2010 @entity21 wave election " a more accurate description might be " the 2010 @entity7 ebb election			2
" @entity62 is a particularly fitting depiction because much of the 2010 election dynamic that helped @entity22 then , and which the @entity22 is banking on for this november as well , can be explained by the rush back away from the polls of the younger diverse wave that swung the country toward @entity7 two years earlier			1
indeed , when we analyze the voter file ( looking precinct by precinct at the number of voters in 2012 versus the number in 2010 ) across a sampling of key battleground states with critical down - ballot and federal races at either the congressional or @entity82 level ( @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 and @entity87 ) to see in reality who is voting and not voting , what you find is that not all midterm drop - off is geopolitically equal			1
the reality is that @entity22 had a much smaller drop in turnout in the midterm compared with the presidential election			0
in key battlegrounds , @entity22 have a 17 - point advantage in the actual voter turnout between base @entity7 precincts and base @entity22 precincts			2
while base @entity22 precincts remain fairly energized from presidential to midterm elections , @entity7 base precincts do not			2
in these key battleground states , 65 - plus performing @entity7 precincts ( precincts that vote @entity7 at a rate of 65 % or better -- in other words , @entity7 base ) turned out at 34 % , while @entity22 65 - plus precincts ( precincts that vote @entity22 at a rate of 65 % or better -- base @entity22 ) turned out at 51 % as a percentage of registration			2
those precincts in the middle between the two ideological bases turned out at a rate of 44 %			0
that in a nutshell is how @entity7 lost in 2010 and how republicans are poised to have a stellar year again in 2014 -- not a wave , but a @entity7 base ebb			1
if @entity7 base precincts across the battleground states turn out on average 17 points lower than @entity22 precincts in november , @entity22 will take the @entity82 and swell their majority in the @entity130 along with their numbers in statehouses across the country			1
regardless of how brilliant our candidates are , or how well our campaigns are run , @entity7 simply are n't going to win if our base precinct turnout is some 40 points off from the presidential election			1
that 's not theory , that 's just cold hard math. yes , @entity7 have to persuade swing voters , but there is n't enough persuasion in the world to make up for a 17 percentage - point difference between @entity7 base precincts and @entity22 base precincts ; that 's a nearly a 2 million vote difference in these five key states alone			1
@entity22 get that midterms are all about firing up their base			0
the election map and history are set up to create a perfect storm for republicans to run up the score and have a spectacular year ; the only thing standing between them having a spectacular year and simply a good year is the @entity7 's base			0
a base that has been underestimated before by @entity30 conventional wisdom			2
note , much of the conventional thinking in 2012 had @entity28 in a really tight race , if not outright losing to @entity166 , and @entity22 making net gains in the @entity82			2
in actuality , the race was n't really that close as @entity28 won by an electoral landslide and @entity7 picked up seats in both the @entity130 and @entity82			1
many observers , riding on the backs of @entity22 pollsters ' models that miscalculated the @entity7 base , missed the possibility of a rising and determined , diverse younger electorate in 2012 that would ultimately lay waste to their perceived reality			2
if @entity7 have any chance of surviving the perfect midterm storm on the horizon , it will be because the same underestimated younger and diverse cohort of voters that anchored the @entity28 majorities are awakened and engaged			1
as it stands now , they are not			0
but there are signs that their value to civic participation has been stirred , and they are looking for vehicles to express their voice for change			0
you hear elements of it in the grass - roots protest by young people happening now ; you hear it in their anxious frustrated refrain , " hands up do n't shoot , " which has spread from @entity204 , @entity205 , to across the globe			0
the question is : will that refrain become hands up go vote as these younger diverse voters connect their frustration to the ballot box in post-obama campaigns ? join us on @entity218 / @entity217 .			0

@entity220 : conventional wisdom says a tea party wave drove *results* of 2010 midterms
he says numbers show a huge drop in @entity7 voters doomed candidates in 2010
in midterms , @entity7 stand to lose @entity82 and more if base does n't turn out , he says
@entity236 : @entity237 , diverse base of @entity28 voters can make a difference if they turn out
