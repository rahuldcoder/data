@entity0 , @entity1 -- a defense lawyer for @entity4 -- accused in @entity1 of killing her roommate -- on tuesday said the prosecution 's theory does n't fit the facts of the case and there is not sufficient evidence to find her guilty			1
calling @entity15 a victim herself , @entity13 portrayed the @entity18 , @entity19 , native as someone who fell victim to a rush to judgment by police following the murder , and who had to fend off a myriad of false media reports regarding the crime			2
police declared " case closed " after an investigator saw @entity15 and her then - boyfriend @entity33 sharing a " flirtatious gesture " at the crime scene			1
and in the months following the murder , @entity13 argued a slew of leaks to the media made things even worse			0
the lawyer showed photos of the crime scene that were published in the media that were n't authentic -- including a photo of the bathroom -- and said false allegations and rumors about @entity15 's character created a bias from the get - go			1
@entity52 also questioned the change in what prosecutor @entity54 's said was the motive for the murder			0
in preliminary hearings he argued @entity15 , @entity33 and @entity59 slashed @entity61 's throat during a sexual misadventure as the two men vied for @entity15 's attention			1
in recent days , @entity13 said @entity54 focused more on what he says was a hatred between the two roommates			0
defense lawyers have staunchly disagreed , claiming the two girls were friends			0
they argued that @entity70 , who was convicted in a separate fast - track trial and is currently appealing his conviction , was the sole killer and argued there is no evidence that ties the three people together or shows proof they planned her murder			0
@entity52 also fixated during closings on the lack of evidence tying @entity15 to the crime scene			2
as defense lawyers have throughout the entire trial , he cast doubt on dna evidence prosecutors claim shows @entity15 's dna on the handle of the alleged murder weapon			1
the defense has claimed the knife does n't match @entity61 's wounds or an imprint of the knife left on a bed sheet			0
they also claimed the dna sample is too small to attribute			0
besides the knife , @entity13 claimed if there really was a struggle or argument in @entity61 's room , then @entity15 's dna would be all over the room			2
citing forensic testimony from the trial , he argued that while traces of @entity97 from other people were found in the room , not a single sample that can be traced back to @entity15 was found			2
he stressed too , that @entity33 and @entity15 are not the kind of people they have been portrayed as , noting that the couple met at a classical music concert and are n't the typical " sex , drugs and rock ' n ' roll " couple they have been labeled			1
during the first day of closings for @entity15 's lawyers , @entity13 stressed to the eight - member jury that they should also keep church law in mind as they decide whether to find @entity15 and @entity33 guilty or not guilty			1
he told the jury they needed to be " morally certain of their decision			0
" " if you have the minimum of doubts , you must absolve this young girl , " he said			1
" a girl that is merely 22 years old			0
" @entity15 and @entity33 , who both deny any role in the murder , have been jailed for more than two years since they were arrested on charges of murder and sexual violence			1
prosecutors have asked they be sentenced to life in prison if they are found guilty			1
@entity15 's other lawyer , @entity143 , will continue closings on wednesday and the jury is expected to begin deliberations on friday			2
@entity2 's @entity147 contributed to this report .			0

@entity150 questions evidence in case , says @entity4 should be found not guilty
prosecutors maintain @entity15 , @entity33 and @entity59 killed @entity59
lawyer : " if you have the minimum of doubts , you must absolve this young girl "
