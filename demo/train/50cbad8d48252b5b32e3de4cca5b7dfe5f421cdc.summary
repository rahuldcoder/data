-- at the launch party for @entity6 executive @entity5 's controversial new book , " @entity7 , " @entity2 mayor @entity1 complained only half jokingly that the book -- which hit @entity10 's best seller list well ahead of its march 11 release -- is doing way better than his book did			1
then he introduced @entity13 , who introduced the woman of the moment			2
and this is unquestionably a moment			2
its significance can be measured by the roiling controversy touched off in recent weeks over the role and place of women in society			2
( if estrogen were combustible , smoke detectors would be screeching			0
) more specifically : how women navigate life as they inch their way toward a fair and equal share of roles in a still male - dominated workplace and in the home space			1
@entity5 and two other alpha females -- @entity36 ceo @entity35 , and @entity38 professor and former top @entity40 official @entity37 -- have taken turns at the center of the debate , @entity34 recently when she declared an end to employee flextime in favor of face time , angering many women ( and men ) , who considered the move a step back			1
the myth of balancing motherhood and a successful career @entity37 , in an @entity56 article last year , wrote of backing away from her @entity40 job over mom - guilt and then criticized @entity5 for signaling in her popular video talks " more than a note of reproach " to such a retreat , while she encouraged women to stay in the game , come what may			1
the new book by @entity5 , chief operating officer of @entity6 , may have caused the biggest stir			1
it 's a well - researched overview of problems women face navigating what she calls the career " jungle gym , " and exhorts women to embrace their power , live up to their highest ambitions , and own the work / life choices made along the way			1
some women -- many who have n't read it -- have slammed it as elitist or as placing the burden of change too much on women and not enough on workplaces			1
i 've been an activist for women for decades , so i 'm thrilled that a top female corporate leader has declared her intention to energize a new wave of women 's advancement			1
but the inevitable backlash is a troubling diversion			0
for one thing , why is this a women 's discussion ? who ever judged a man for not being home to cook his child 's dinner or wipe her nose ? or opting not to take paternity leave ? why this incessant drumbeat about women and the work / life choices they make ? why should only women shoulder the double burden of work and family responsibilities ? and why has n't the workplace caught up to the needs of the women who have been flooding into it for years now ? one answer , according to a research paper last year from a team headed by @entity120 's @entity119 , may be resistance of married men with stay - at - home wives			1
the team 's findings included , for example , that " employed husbands in traditional and neo-traditional marriages , compared to those in modern marriages , tend to ( a ) view the presence of women in the workplace unfavorably , ( b ) perceive that organizations with larger numbers of female employees are operating less smoothly , ( c ) find organizations with female leaders as relatively unattractive , and ( d ) deny , more frequently , qualified female employees opportunities for promotion			1
" organizational structures of workplaces were , after all , designed originally by men , for men with wives at home caring for the kids , the old folks , and the house			2
and culturally ingrained " implicit bias " influences both men and women to value men 's traditional leadership roles more than women 's			1
opinion : working moms , do n't try to be perfect at home but such attitudes are neither realistic nor sustainable			2
in today 's world of two - earner families , businesses that do n't shift to accommodate to families ' needs -- such as paid sick leave flexible enough to permit caring for children and elders -- are not only dysfunctional , they lose their women workers			1
recognizing this brain drain and its negative impact on business , nearly 550 ceos from major companies globally have signed the @entity176 , a collaboration between @entity178 and the @entity178 @entity179 ( its tagline : " equality means business " )			0
i recently attended a convocation of this group , which includes such giants as @entity188 , @entity189 , @entity190 , and @entity191 , and heard male and female executives passionately asserting that inclusion of women is not just the right thing to do , it is a strategic business imperative			1
if women are so strategically important -- and graduating from college and pouring into the job market at a higher rate than men -- should n't they be in a position to demand a more family - friendly workplace ? consider : if women had been in charge of creating the organizational structures for the last few hundred years , would n't we all have figured out how to care for the kids and elders without losing the value of half the population 's intelligence in the workplace ? it is time for women to stand up to seize this moment , as sure to wreak havoc with prevailing norms as the second wave feminism that inspired me in the 1960s to morph from real @entity223 housewife ( i mean really real -- three kids by age 20 and no employable skills ) to college student to volunteer women 's activist to a full - out career			1
let 's stop dancing on the head of a pin to someone else 's argument about who is more righteous : the woman who opts out to care for children , or the one who leans in to leadership in the corporate world , or the one who dodges both options to create a part - time alternative			2
conflicts like this keep women fighting each other rather than using our collective power to push for systemic changes in the workplace , changes that can open up choices for us and generations to come			2
work and family : how do you it work ? creating them is n't easy , but the steps are simple			2
i call it @entity262 , and like - minded men are welcome to join			0
first , be a sister at work -- make alliances with people who share your concerns			0
do n't let yourself be isolated			0
reach out to give help and ask for help when you need it			0
second , have the courage to raise issues			0
engage even when it 's hard			0
that does n't mean being unkind			0
it does mean not backing off			0
it means defining your own terms -- for flextime , for pay raises , for promotion , for creating a practical , productive work situation where everyone wins			0
as a military strategist once told his advisers , when they told him they could n't possibly win on the battlefield as mapped : " draw a bigger map			0
" and negotiation expert @entity291 says women do benefit most from negotiation when they operate from a straightforward position they define and stick to			0
and third , put sister and courage together into a purposeful strategy and keep moving until you 've reached the goal			0
do n't backslide in the pursuit of parity goals			0
as @entity302 illustrated in " victory : the @entity308 , " the gay rights movement has changed attitudes toward same - sex couples by applying these movement - building principles			0
if women quit arguing and work toward systemic changes together , we can retool the workplace for a successful 21st century			1
if we do n't ? twenty years from now we may still be bemoaning the fact that even though women earn 57 % of college degrees , hold 85 % of the consumer purchasing purse , are 54 % of voters and half the workplace , they 're stuck at under one - fifth of congressional , corporate board , and top management seats			1
social movements by nature are messy and do not go in straight lines			0
striving together , not just to adapt ourselves , but to change the system is the key to a fair , just , and thriving society for women and men			1
editor 's note : join @entity332 on @entity6 for a live discussion about women and the workplace on tuesday from noon to 1 p.m. et. bring your questions and thoughts			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity341 .			2

@entity341 : work / life balance and women 's success big issues in the culture recently
@entity341 : @entity5 , @entity34 , @entity37 at center of moment that 's divided women ; it must n't
she asks : why is this still problem ? workplace should be changing for big influx of women
@entity341 : workplace structure laid out by men , but women should use new *leverage* to change it
