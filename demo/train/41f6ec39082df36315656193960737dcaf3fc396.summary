@entity0 handed his fellow @entity2 @entity1 a tough three - set loss in the semifinals of the @entity5 on saturday			1
but it turns out the nearly three - hour epic also took something out of the 33 - year - old			0
@entity0 pulled out of the final against @entity11 on sunday , marking just the third time in his career he gave his opponent a walkover			1
@entity0 went on court in a track suit to tell the crowd he was n't match fit and later on @entity19 revealed he hurt his back " late in the match yesterday			1
" he disclosed in a subsequent interview with the @entity23 it happened in the third - set tiebreaker of his late - night 4 - 6 7 - 5 7 - 6 ( 6 ) victory over @entity1			2
" i felt all of a sudden the back was feeling funny , " @entity0 told the @entity23			0
" i tried to have treatment on it , medication on it , just tried to turn around as quick as possible really , but did n't really feel that much of an improvement overnight			0
" @entity0 was plagued by back issues in 2013 , largely contributing to a subpar -- for him -- campaign			0
he had been in good health in 2014 , though , one of the reasons the 17 - time grand slam champion was able to climb the rankings and finish at no. 2			0
" i tried all year to be ready for the @entity5 , and i did n't want it to end this way , " @entity0 stated to the crowd			1
" it would be too risky at my age to do this right now and i hope you understand			0
" i wanted to come out personally and excuse myself			0
it 's been a great week for me			0
i played some great tennis and i love coming to the @entity50 and to @entity51 , and there 's been so many great memories for me here			1
" @entity11 thus becomes the first men 's player since @entity56 in 1987 to claim three consecutive year - end titles and his 31 - match winning streak indoors remains intact			1
he learned of @entity0 's withdrawal during the doubles final , which was scheduled 2 1/2 hours before the singles final			1
" it 's a very awkward situation to talk about , " @entity11 told reporters			2
" you never like to win , especially these big matches against big rivals , with a ( walkover )			0
" world no. 1 @entity11 stuck around to play an exhibition set against @entity70 and that was followed by a doubles tussle featuring @entity70 and @entity73 against @entity74 and @entity75			2
as big a blow as it was for @entity0 not to play , questions will now center around his fitness for the @entity81 final against @entity82 in @entity83 that starts on friday			1
indeed the @entity2 team might be out of sorts come the final , since the @entity0 - @entity1 encounter saturday -- when @entity0 saved four match points -- became ill - tempered at times			1
@entity1 crunched a backhand at @entity0 when the latter was at the net and also , at one stage , @entity1 jawed at the @entity0 camp , seemingly unhappy with something that was said to him			1
the @entity81 is one of the lone huge titles @entity0 has not won			2
" recovery obviously as quick as possible , and then traveling to @entity82 at some point and getting ready on the clay for the @entity81 final , " @entity0 said of his immediate plans			1
sunday 's dramatic events brought an end to a tournament plagued by lopsided results in singles			0
only four of the 14 singles matches extended to three sets			0
" but this is something you can not predict , " said @entity11 , who handed out chocolates to journalists just as he did after winning last year 's event			2
the doubles competition featured plenty of excitement , including in the final when @entity120 @entity119 and @entity121 beat @entity123 's @entity122 and @entity125 's @entity124 6 - 7 ( 5 ) 6 - 2 10 - 7 .			0

@entity11 wins a third straight @entity5 after @entity0 withdraws
@entity0 said he was n't " match fit " and it would be " too risky " to play sunday in @entity51
@entity0 had played for about three hours saturday in beating fellow @entity2 @entity1
@entity0 will be needed if @entity2 is to down @entity82 in this week 's @entity81 final
