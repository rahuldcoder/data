-- you know her best as a multi-platinum recording artist and a 14 - time @entity6 - winning singer , songwriter and producer			2
but @entity9 has also made quite a name for herself as a philanthropist and @entity13 advocate			1
it was in 2003 , on her first trip to @entity16 , when keys witnessed firsthand the disease 's devastation			2
when she returned to the @entity20 , she co-founded " @entity21 , " an organization that has raised millions to care for hiv / aids patients in @entity16 and @entity24			0
" so , as i 've grown , you know , i think one of the things that i 've realized is that there are not the headlines about the @entity13 pandemic here in @entity20 that there should be , and it is shocking , and it is unacceptable , " keys told @entity0 last month			0
@entity36 : half of young people with @entity39 do n't know it " yet we 're not speaking about it , and so that 's what 's kind of brought me around to really becoming a part of what i like to say , ' bridging the conversation ' so that there 's not only an international conversation , there 's not only a domestic conversation , there 's a global conversation that we can all be a part of			1
" keys brought that conversation to @entity57 , where she met with women being treated at the @entity61 's @entity60			2
she also teamed up with @entity13 , a national public information group founded by the @entity64 and the @entity65 , to launch her latest initiative -- a campaign aimed at reaching out specifically to @entity20 women			1
it 's called " @entity76 " and phase one features a video of @entity55 and five women who are hiv - positive from all walks of life			1
they include @entity78 , a college graduate diagnosed at 19 ; and @entity80 , diagnosed three years ago after her new husband got sick and died of the disease ( she did not know he 'd been @entity39 - positive for a decade )			1
also included are @entity83 , a graduate student born with the virus ; @entity85 , a wife and mother who was diagnosed at 18 ; and @entity88 , a wife , mother , grandmother and home health care professional who found out she was @entity39 - positive when she was just 17 -- and pregnant			1
the women share their stories and their determination to change the course -- and the face -- of hiv / aids			2
keys said she wants all women to know the facts about @entity39 and its impact on women ; to be able to speak openly about the disease with family and friends ; to protect themselves and their loved ones ; to get tested without shame ; and to live rich , healthy lives by getting and staying on treatment			1
why youths are n't getting tested for hiv " we ca n't act like it 's not happening			0
we have to make sure we know that we 're all at risk			0
this is all of our issues , you know			0
this does n't make you bad			0
... you should n't feel like you 're ashamed			0
we have to make sure that we are demanding access to being tested			0
we have to demand access to treatment with dignity			0
" she found an ally in senior @entity128 adviser @entity127 , whose passion about the epidemic inspired her			0
part of that passion , @entity131 said , comes from losing her sister - in - law nearly 20 years ago to the disease			0
" she was married with a young child and did n't really get the testing that she should have had early on in her illness because it never occurred to anyone that a married mom would actually ... be @entity39 positive , " @entity131 told @entity0			1
" losing her was just devastating for our family and so that 's where i began to realize , of course , this could happen to anybody 's family			0
" more than 1.1 million @entity20 are @entity39 positive , according to the @entity36			1
one in five do n't know they 're infected			0
one in four people living with @entity39 is a woman			1
in @entity57 , one of the hardest - hit areas in the country , rates among @entity16 - @entity20 women have skyrocketed -- more than 92 % of women living with @entity39 there are black			1
it was here , last year , that @entity9 and @entity131 came together and decided to support each other 's efforts			1
president @entity164 is committed to the goal of an aids - free generation and will do everything in his power to eradicate the disease , according to @entity131			0
that includes $ 23 billion for @entity39 in next year 's proposed budget			1
but , said @entity131 , @entity39 still has to be brought out of the shadows			1
timeline : @entity13 moments to remember " we ca n't pretend it does n't exist , " @entity131 said			0
" when people share these stories , it de-stigmatizes it , it brings it out in to the light and when we do that , we improve the quality of life that all people will have			2
" for its part , @entity187 will provide community - based grants of up to $ 25,000 for programs focused on women			2
that , @entity9 hopes , will help open up a meaningful dialogue in this country			1
" for a woman and a black woman , you know , this is a conversation that we must have as all women			1
again , as all human beings , we have to have this conversation , " she said			0
" i feel like this is an incredibly wonderful opportunity that we have to have a real dialogue , woman to woman , mother to mother , sister to sister , brother to sister ... father to daughter , daughter to mother , you know , friend to friend			2
this is what we have to start absolutely being open about			2
