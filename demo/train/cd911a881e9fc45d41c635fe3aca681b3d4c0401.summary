another proposal for change is surfacing at the @entity2			1
the body that regulates athletics at the vast majority of @entity7 colleges and universities is thinking about redefining academic fraud			1
there has been some confusion in the last few years about exactly what the @entity2 's responsibility is when it came to academic fraud on campus			1
so the organization 's @entity15 ordered a review , deciding that for an academic scandal to lead to violations there needs to be both a nexus to a school 's athletics department , and it needs to affect the eligibility of athletes			1
" now that it 's clarified , do we like it ? " said @entity27 , who chairs the 23 - member @entity15			2
" how much institutional autonomy do we want ? how much oversight do we want ? " @entity27 said those questions were brought to the committee long before a firestorm of public pressure on the @entity2 to revisit its decision not to sanction the @entity39 over its " paper class " scandal , saying it involved more students than just athletes			1
as @entity46 first reported , congressional hearings could be the upshot of inaction by the @entity2 on the @entity39 scandal ; @entity7 rep. @entity50 , @entity51 , is sending a letter to @entity2 president @entity53 demanding answers about the @entity2 's handling of it			1
two years ago , @entity39 's internal investigation uncovered that several athletes were enrolled in classes where little or no work was required			0
a grand jury in @entity61 , @entity62 , recently indicted a former professor who allegedly accepted money for teaching those " no - show " classes			1
@entity50 , a member of the @entity66 , told @entity46 he is prepared to issue subpoenas and call for a hearing if @entity53 does n't provide substantive answers to his letter			2
@entity27 said there have been some passionate discussions among the @entity15 members the last few meetings			0
the next meeting is in june , and she said there is a possibility that during that meeting they will make recommendations to the @entity2 leadership council , which meets again later in the summer			1
" everyone assumes because of the timing this is a @entity39 issue , " @entity27 said			0
" this came up first on our agenda way before the @entity39 case			0
everything the @entity2 does takes a long time			2
the cabinet only meets three times a year for a day and half , and that 's not the only thing on the agenda			0
" certainly , all of us are aware of it , but that 's not the impetus for the discussion , and it 's not the only case we 're talking about , " she said			0
the @entity2 @entity105 recently said a discussion of academic misconduct will " occur in the new governance structure " that would include new members to the board of directors and giving five major @entity110 conferences more power in making decisions affecting student - athletes			1
juggling too much ? but @entity116 , a former compliance director who worked in collegiate athletics for 30 years , is skeptical there will be academic fraud changes			1
" they are trying to divert attention from what i consider to be a most obvious case of outrageous academic fraud , to needing a redefinition of academic fraud , " @entity116 said			1
@entity116 and another professor , @entity127 at @entity128 , just started research that will compare what is known about @entity39 's academic scandal to other institution 's academic scandals and how they were handled by the @entity2			1
@entity116 said he suspects this may be the @entity2 's way of getting around taking a second look at what happened at @entity39			2
" from what i see at the moment , i feel strongly it is the worst academic fraud violation in the history of the @entity2 , " @entity116 said			1
" ... they choose to ignore it			0
they are juggling so many balls right now , with respect to lawsuits , unionization issues , they really ca n't afford right at this moment to open up a major investigation on @entity62			1
it would further jeopardize public confidence in the @entity2 's ability to control athletics			1
" he frames it with " from what i see at the moment , " because the full breadth of what happened at @entity39 is still trickling out , two years after it was first reported by the @entity163 of @entity164			0
@entity39 has long insisted that the paper classes were solely the idea of one man -- now - indicted professor @entity167 , who was head of the @entity168			0
the school says it has instituted reforms to ensure such academic problems do n't recur			2
a third look at @entity39 scandal this year , shortly after @entity46 reported the findings of whistleblower @entity175 that showed a shocking number of functionally illiterate and ill - prepared student athletes at the prestigious public school , @entity39 announced it commissioned its third review of the scandal			2
whistleblower leaves : ' it 's been a hostile work environment ' this time , former @entity185 attorney @entity184 is taking a look			0
among his questions : did members of the athletic department know and talk about the paper classes ? previous reports commissioned by @entity39 said no. another question : how long was this happening ? there is still no clear answer on that , either			0
meanwhile , @entity175 says she expects to play a role in the upcoming civil case of former @entity200 basketball star @entity199 vs. the @entity2			1
@entity199 is suing to allow student - athletes to be compensated the use of their name and likeness			0
several @entity2 critics have told @entity46 they believe the @entity2 refuses to look at the fraud at @entity39 because it might mean conceding their biggest argument against paying players -- that they athletes are paid in the form of an education			1
" the umbilical cord between the student and the athlete is being slowly cut and if it 's cut i think that has very serious consequences for the @entity2 , " said @entity212 , former basketball star - turned - congressman and a member of the @entity216 's @entity215			2
" athletes are not given an education			0
they step out of the university and they may have a degree , but they do n't have an education and that 's the sad thing about it			0
" @entity229 has advised those pushing for reform -- most recently those behind the attempt by @entity234 football players to unionize -- to go after the @entity2 over the way they handle academic fraud			1
he said during a forum at the @entity240 that academic fraud is " the chink in the armor " of the @entity2			1
power conferences may get more autonomy whether that pressure is working remains to be seen , but never before have there been so many consecutive pushes for reform			0
as @entity199 's case goes to court this summer , the @entity234 union case will be moving through appeal , and an antitrust lawsuit filed by four current athletes to eliminate the compensation cap will be making its way through the first stages of the civil court process			2
@entity53 , the @entity2 president , has spent the last few weeks making waves with polarizing media interviews			2
it all led to an @entity2 board of directors meeting on thursday and a proposal to give more power to five so - called power conferences and their 65 universities			1
in turn the schools would be able to give more benefits like having the option of increasing stipends for athletes to keep up with the cost of attending college and other small pleasures , like paying for airline flights to championship games for their families			0
a final vote will be taken in august			0
the changes are in line with what reformists want			0
but @entity285 , president of the @entity286 and the main force behind the @entity234 union attempt , cautions on the @entity2 's motives			2
for 13 years ( the @entity2 ) has fought all of these changes and now that their backs are against the ropes , " @entity290 said , referencing the legal actions			2
" they had no choice but to gravitate towards the goals that we 've set to pursue			0
it 's definitely a step in the right direction , but it 's not quite voluntary			0
it 's not that schools and conferences are coming to their senses , it 's that players are mobilizing and forcing change			0

@entity2 looking at two elements of definition of academic fraud
next meeting for committee is in june
critics are concerned @entity2 did n't see a scandal at @entity62 as a case of athletics violations
@entity2 also looking at giving five big conferences more decision - making ability on benefits
