-- call it a tech - induced hydrophobia			2
consumer electronics and water do n't mix , and for many , there are few things more nerve - racking than a smartphone or tablet that 's been accidentally doused			1
a rainy day or a trip to the beach means gingerly baby - sitting our devices			2
and kitchens and bathrooms are fraught with danger zones : sinks , bathtubs and worse			0
" i ca n't tell you how many people i know who 've accidentally dropped their phone in the toilet , or their kid spilled their juice box all over it , " @entity19 senior writer @entity18 told @entity0			0
a soaked phone or tablet has traditionally meant shelling out for a costly replacement			2
but new technology has moved beyond waterproof cases and " rugged " cell phones designed to withstand rough conditions			0
devices highlighted at this year 's @entity36 and @entity37 suggest the future is bright for phones and tablets that are both stylish and waterproof -- or at least water - resistant			1
@entity42 's @entity41 was a hot item at last week 's @entity36 because of its sleek design and functionality , with the ability to withstand getting wet a cool add - on			1
" if you 're having a bath and you really want to enjoy that great movie ... and ( the tablet ) accidentally falls into the bath , it 's ok , " said @entity49 product manager @entity48			1
that level of waterproofing is already incorporated in a few @entity42 smartphones such as the @entity59 and @entity60 , and most recently with the @entity49 the @entity49 's makers said it can withstand sprays of water -- such as sprinkler play on a lawn or a water fight			1
they even claim it can be dunked in up to 3 feet of water for up to 30 minutes			2
there 's no specific or special coating on the device , @entity48 said			0
rather , the device is made water - resistant in all of its parts without the stereotypically bulky design for which so - called rugged phones have been known			1
" we see today that a lot of consumers would like to use their device in the rain -- say you 're trying to using @entity84 and navigating , " @entity48 said			0
or " you 're out at the pub and someone accidentally spills their drink			0
if that 's the case , you can just rinse the device under a tap of water			2
" however , @entity42 cautions that the device 's port covers need to be sealed up tight for its claim to ... well , hold water			1
the phone 's @entity98 slots , micro-usb and headphone sockets all have little rubber - lined port covers -- sort of like the gas tank cover on a car -- that must be flipped out for access , as @entity107 noted in its review of the @entity49 phone			1
@entity42 is n't alone in efforts to provide a sturdier smartphone			1
@entity113 's @entity112 submerged its @entity115 phone for the benefit of attendees at the @entity36 , and @entity118 added a water - resistant @entity120 smartphone to its line last summer			1
@entity122 also has options for the water wary , such as the @entity125 , @entity126 and the @entity127			0
hottest gadgets at world 's biggest mobile technology show " we use a splash - guard coating on our phones to help with the accidental coffee spill or when you get caught in the rain , " a spokeswoman for the company told @entity0			1
a second rep described it as " hydrophobic nano - coating , " which " permeates into the device to repel water " and also protects the electrical boards inside			2
that said , the rep added , " you should n't submerge the phone			0
" other companies trying to solve tech 's liquid - incompatibility problem repeat the same mantra : water - resistant features are there to help in case of accidents , not to make a phone safe for scuba diving			1
a startup called @entity159 offers a liquid - repellent coating , now in its second generation , that encases electronics to keep them dry			0
the company said its coating can hold up against use in heavy rain or a surprise dunking			0
the downside : it costs at least $ 60 , and you must part with your phone for several days while @entity159 applies the coating and then ships it back to you			0
its effectiveness has been up for debate as curious testers have posted a range of online reviews -- both positive and negative where @entity159 sells to consumers , companies such @entity181 and @entity182 are focusing on incorporating their waterproofing technology in products before they 're shipped out			0
the liquid - repellent coating developed by @entity182 can be found on the @entity188 997 , whereas @entity181 just announced a partnership with @entity190 to apply its waterproofing technology to a forthcoming limited edition @entity194 android phone			0
while @entity182 describes its invisible " hydrophobic layer " as covering the exterior and interior of a product , @entity181 touts what it calls " @entity205 " technology , which is applied to the internal circuitry of a device to protect it from moisture			0
how mainstream water - resistant features become will likely depend on demand , said @entity19 's @entity18			1
" some of these fringe guys , like @entity118 and @entity42 , are seeing an opportunity that the average consumer wants some of those features , too			1
you can see it because of the massive market for cases and accessories to keep these devices shock - proof and also water - resistant , " @entity18 said			1
the real question , she said , is whether we 'll start to see top manufacturers such as @entity224 adding the feature to their products			0
" i 'm not sure if we 're going to see that immediately , " @entity18 said , " but it would n't surprise me if in a couple of years this became a more standard feature on devices			2
" in the meantime , there 's always that low - tech fix if your beloved device has gone for an unplanned swim : find a bowl and pick up a bag of rice			2
