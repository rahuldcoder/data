-- it will be a messy weekend in the @entity2 and the @entity3 as the massive weather system that walloped 20 states with a snowstorm rolls off toward the @entity7			1
a winter storm is expected to deposit up to 10 inches of snow in isolated pockets of western @entity11 , and 6 inches to a foot in parts of southern @entity14 and @entity15 , and central @entity16			1
this is not the same storm that blanketed the @entity19 , said @entity0 meteorologist @entity20 , although it is part of the same overall system that spans the country from north to south			1
it will be much less intense , he said , and it should not affect the places hardest hit by the blizzard that plastered the @entity2 two weeks ago , knocking out power to hundreds of thousands of customers			1
@entity30 will likely see a slushy mix of rain and snow that could lead to downed branches and power lines , @entity20 said			1
track severe weather rain will continue to soak the eastern @entity38 from @entity39 , on down , especially sunday , according to the @entity41			1
" across the @entity45 , some of the rainfall totals are going to be staggering , " said @entity0 meteorologist @entity42			2
parts of the central @entity45 should get 4 to 6 inches of rainfall			2
some snow records the outgoing system will have made its mark on virtually the entire country from the southwest corner of @entity53 to central @entity16 , leaving its deepest imprint on @entity55			1
@entity56 saw its second - highest storm snowfall total on record with 14.2 inches over two days , the said			2
the town of @entity60 in the state 's middle lay under a 22 inch layer of white by the time the storm roared by			2
@entity66 was not far behind , with accumulations of around a foot in some places			2
the snow set a record at @entity72 , with 9 inches falling in a single day			1
the old record was 5.1 inches set in 2010			0
some businesses and universities shut down thursday as state officials urged residents to stay off the roads			0
the white blanket emptied the streets of @entity72			0
silver lining the snowstorm turned out to be a welcome one to many @entity83 and many others throughout the @entity19 , who have been suffering a drought for a third straight year			0
@entity55 , @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity66 and a host of other farm - heavy states have seen crop losses as a result			0
the @entity94 expects those conditions to continue into april , but near - record levels of snowfall will ease the problem and could accelerate the drought 's end			0
" it snows so infrequently here			0
now we 've been in a really bad drought for several years ; really , really hot summer and just no moisture			0
so we 're thrilled to see snow or ice -- whatever moisture we can get , " @entity56 resident @entity106 said			1
ranchers embraced the storm , even though bitter cold snow can be deadly during calving season			1
@entity113 , a @entity55 rancher from @entity114 and the immediate past president of the @entity116 , said the storm caused more work for him because he had to bring his calves inside to warm them up			0
but he called the snowstorm a blessing for bringing good moisture to the winter wheat .			0

the massive system sweeping the @entity38 wraps up with a wet finale
the far @entity2 should see snow
slushy snow or rain should fall from @entity30 on down
