-- the little girl was deeply concerned			0
so on christmas eve , she called in to the @entity4 's @entity3 tracking center with an urgent question : " if i lose my tooth , and the @entity6 comes , could the @entity6 scare away @entity3 ? " the @entity3 trackers at @entity4 started on christmas eve at 6 a.m. et , fielding questions from all over the globe and continuing a tradition that began by accident in 1955			1
that year , an ad placed in a local @entity15 newspaper encouraged kids to call a phone number to find out @entity3 's whereabouts on @entity19 , but instead of the intended number , the operations center for what is now called @entity4 was printed			1
col. @entity23 was in charge that night , and instead of hanging up , he had his operators find @entity3 and report on his location			2
@entity4 is typically charged with detecting attacks against @entity28 by aircraft , missiles or space vehicles , but on christmas eve , its high - tech tools of detection are repurposed to find and track @entity3			1
@entity34 , a media spokesman at @entity4 , says the organization is on track to receive more than 100,000 calls and 10,000 e-mails			1
he says the volunteer @entity3 trackers are mostly @entity4 workers or their family members			1
after a quick briefing , the trackers start taking calls , relaying @entity3 's position as shown on a big screen on the front wall of the call center			1
tracking information is also posted to @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52			0
on the other end of the phone for some lucky youngsters monday was first lady @entity56 , who watched @entity3 's progress along with children nationwide from her vacation in @entity61			1
when 5 - year - old @entity62 from @entity63 called her , @entity3 was delivering presents to the children of @entity66			2
" and you know how many gifts he 's delivered already ? " the first lady asked @entity62 , who said he wanted a four - wheeler for @entity19			0
" no , m'am , " he replied , according to a transcript from the @entity71			0
the first lady replied , " more than 3 billion gifts he 's already delivered			0
" @entity73 , whose favorite @entity19 song is " @entity75 , " spoke with @entity56 alongside her siblings , @entity77 and @entity78 , while @entity3 flew over @entity79			1
and @entity80 , age 4 , guessed that the red nose visible on the satellite as the sleigh flew over the sleeping children of @entity86 was " @entity87			0
" @entity34 says @entity4 has learned that @entity3 " roughly arrives at homes between 9 p.m. and midnight , but only after the kids have gone to bed			2
" he says that kids can help make things a lot easier for @entity3 if they 're in bed at that time so he does n't have to backtrack			2
as for the monumental logistical challenge of delivering all those gifts ( @entity4 reports that he 's already delivered more than 2 billion gifts , as of 1 p.m. et ) , @entity34 says that time to @entity3 is different from what it is to most people			2
" what seems like 24 hours to you and i actually is a lot more significant period of time to @entity3			0
... that 's what allows him to actually travel all around the world in a 24 - hour period			0
" while the @entity3 trackers handle a variety of questions , there are some they just do n't have the answer to			1
one child called in earlier to ask if @entity3 likes president @entity116 or his electoral opponent , former @entity118 gov. @entity117			0
@entity34 replied : " @entity3 would have to best answer that question			0
what we do is make sure @entity3 travels safely			0
