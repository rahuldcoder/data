" my brothers from @entity33 affirmed that they will return to their communities as soon as the legislative decrees are repealed , " she said			2
" we are thankful because the will of the indigenous people has been heard and we only hope that , in the future , government will pay attention to and listen to the people and not legislate behind their backs			1
" however , despite praising president @entity15 for supporting the revocation of the decrees , @entity43 said that had he done so earlier , lives might have been saved			1
she called for the repealing of seven remaining legislative decrees and the immediate lifting of the state of emergency and curfew in the city of @entity54			2
and she asked the government to stop the political persecution of her group 's leaders , including @entity59 , who faces charges in @entity1 related to the clashes			1

the vote came a day after @entity15 's cabinet chief , @entity66 , called on lawmakers to repeal the laws which have created tension between the government and indigenous communities in the @entity72			1
striking the contentious @entity74 and a related decree -- laws that @entity3 had voted last week to suspend indefinitely -- " will prevent more blood from being spilled , " @entity66 said wednesday			0

the controversial laws were part of numerous decrees that @entity15 passed through special powers awarded to him by @entity3 last year with the goal of having @entity1 meet rules set in a free trade agreement with the @entity102			1

those include requesting to repeal the controversial laws , ending a state of emergency in the @entity72 area and forming a working group with the indigenous groups , she said			2
the government 's responses have diffused tensions , but " had the government done this process of consultation earlier , we would n't have seen the blockades , and avoided the violence , " @entity116 said			2
the real test for the @entity15 government will be how seriously officials listen to the concerns of indigenous citizens , @entity116 said			2
" these are positive steps , but the question is the process -- will they really allow for detailed debate ? " she said			0
