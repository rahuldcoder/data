-- @entity1 knows there 's a huge gap in age and technology between him and his adolescent students			2
critics say social - networking site communications blur the necessary line between educators and students			1
so when the 52 - year - old set up a @entity14 page and his students began asking to add him as a friend and sending him questions about assignments , he realized he was on to something			1
" just the very fact that i have @entity14 makes them think , ' well , maybe we can talk to this guy and open the lines of communication , ' " said @entity1 , who teaches @entity20 at @entity21 in @entity22 , @entity23			1
" i realized this is a major way of communication for them			2
" @entity14 had 72.8 million national users in june , versus @entity33 's 37.4 million , according to a @entity35 study			1
once available only to students with college e-mail addresses , @entity33 opened its virtual doors to everybody two years ago			2
despite perceptions , the sites are n't populated just by teens and 20 - somethings			0
a 2006 @entity35 survey found that half of those registered on @entity14 were 35 and older , while a similar study last year found that almost 40 percent of @entity33 users were above 35			2
teachers such as @entity1 believe sites like @entity14 help them connect with their students about homework , tutoring and other school matters			1
but others fear the social - networking sites are breeding inappropriate relationships between teachers and students			1
in @entity23 in particular , a rash of student - teacher sexual relationships have spawned crackdowns on social - networking friendships			1
web site badbadteacher.com , which keeps track of teachers disciplined , arrested and convicted of inappropriate behavior with students , lists 11 such teachers from @entity23 within the last two years			1
which is why state legislator @entity70 is sponsoring a bill in the @entity72 that would ban elementary school teachers from having social - networking friendships with their students			1
@entity1 said he understands the reasoning for the bill			0
he acknowledged that in some cases , teachers have become the public face of inappropriate @entity33 and @entity14 relationships with kids			1
" i see where they are coming from , " @entity1 said			0
" you ca n't argue with people whose intentions are trying to protect children			0
but the simple fact is , you take these people who prey on children and they are going to find a way to do it , whether it 's over @entity33 or not			0
" those teachers are ruining it for the ones legitimately trying to help children , @entity1 said			2
" there are so many kids who are stubborn against anything teachers say , who are struggling in the classroom and refuse to ask for help , " @entity1 said			0
" when it 's so hard to reach these kids , why would you remove any of the weapons at your disposal to make a difference ? " @entity33 does not knowingly collect personal information from anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to register , according to its web site			0
users must be at least 14 to register on @entity14 , although such age restrictions are difficult to enforce			2
in addition to the bill in the @entity23 legislature , other school boards , teacher unions and parent - teacher associations across the country are drafting policies and issuing advisements about which online or text - messaging relationships are acceptable			1
the @entity123 in @entity23 recently implemented a policy forbidding teachers and students from having any text - message conversations or social - networking friendships			1
@entity129 , an education lawyer who represents several school boards in @entity23 , has been giving talks to teachers in which he explains that most of the inappropriate student - teacher relationships start out on a friendship level			1
@entity129 spoke of one instance where a parent thought her child was spending extra time with a teacher who was trying to help her child overcome shyness			0
at @entity129 's urging , they checked the child 's phone bill and found 4,200 text messages between the teacher and student			0
" as an educator , there is a line of demarcation between you and your student , " @entity129 said			0
" it 's a line that you can not come close to , let alone step over			0
you 've got to establish it from @entity160 and say , ' i 'm not your buddy ; i 'm not your friend ; i 'm just your teacher			0
' " @entity129 agrees that teachers sometimes need to communicate after school with students about educational matters , but he said that 's why teachers in @entity23 have their own class pages hosted by their school districts			1
those pages eliminate the need for @entity33 or @entity14 , he says , and allow the schools to monitor all student - teacher communication			1
many students , including @entity177 , a senior at @entity178 in @entity179 , @entity23 , said that although their teachers have school - sponsored pages , most students rarely check them			2
@entity1 insists that @entity33 and @entity14 are n't the evils that regulators should be after			2
instead @entity1 wishes the focus remain on vetting the teachers being put in charge of the nation 's youth			0
" it 's a sad thing , but with teaching you are going to have people who are attracted to the profession because of easy availability of kids , " @entity1 said			0
" those predators are going to be there			0
but most of the time there are warning signs , and that 's what we need to be working on , getting those people out ... not stopping teachers who have n't caused problems from reaching those who need [ help ] most			0

some teachers use sites like @entity14 to help connect , communicate with students
critics say the online communication breeds inappropriate relationships
proposed law would ban teachers from having online friendships with students
teacher says predators will get to children even if online friendships barred
