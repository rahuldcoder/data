@entity0 -- president @entity2 on monday nominated gen. @entity3 , the relatively new @entity4 chief of staff , to be the next chairman of the @entity6			1
the term of the current chairman , adm. @entity8 , ends in september			1
@entity2 also nominated adm. @entity9 , the current head of the @entity11 , to serve as vice chairman			1
he tapped gen. @entity13 to replace @entity3 as the @entity4 's chief of staff			1
the president , speaking at the @entity16 , urged the @entity17 to confirm the three men " as swiftly as possible " in order to help ensure a " seamless " @entity21 transition			2
who is gen. @entity3 ? @entity2 praised @entity3 as one of the country 's most " respected and combat - tested generals			1
" " i expect him to push all our forces to keep adapting and innovating , " @entity2 said			1
" we will provide what it takes to achieve our objectives in the current fight			0
" outgoing defense secretary @entity33 released a statement praising @entity3 , @entity35 , and @entity13 for having " excelled in key command and staff roles " and possessing " the right mix of intellectual heft , moral courage , and strategic vision			1
" if confirmed by the @entity17 , @entity3 would be in the key position of being @entity2 's senior military adviser overseeing the drawdown of troops in @entity46 and @entity47			1
he would also work with incoming defense secretary @entity48 , who still needs to be confirmed by the @entity17 , in establishing priorities for cutting defense spending			0
@entity3 has extensive combat experience			1
he served as the commander of the @entity53 in @entity54 in 2003 , and then helped train @entity46 security forces in a subsequent tour of duty in @entity46			0
he also has served as acting commander of the @entity59 overseeing @entity61 military operations in the @entity62 , @entity63 and @entity64			0
the selection of @entity3 is unusual partly because he took over as head of the @entity4 only on april 11			1
in that brief period of time , @entity3 has earned strong praise for what is considered to be his outgoing personality			1
among other things , the general receives a list of soldiers both in the @entity61 and overseas every week and calls them to get their direct opinions on life in the @entity4			2
he spent last friday in @entity0 meeting with children who have lost parents and other relatives in war - time military service			0
he has also gained attention for his long - standing habit of beginning some of his public speaking events by singing songs such as " @entity87			0
" on his @entity89 page he recently asked troops to offer their suggestions for music he could play at events where he is speaking			0
@entity3 's sense of humor has opened him up for some ribbing as well , like at the ceremony when he took command of the @entity4			1
" his rise to this great height is yet another one of those classic @entity61 immigrant success stories , " said army secretary @entity99 during official remarks			0
" one can only imagine how different his life might have been had his family not decided to leave @entity106 and move across the river to @entity108			0
" gen. @entity109 , a four - @entity110 who currently is vice chairman of the @entity6 , had been the perceived front runner to replace @entity8			1
but in a 30 - minute meeting with @entity2 before the president left for his recent trip to @entity115 , @entity109 was told he would not get the job , according to a @entity118 official with direct knowledge of the meeting			2
the official declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of discussing @entity16 personnel meetings involving the president			0
@entity109 is now expected to submit his retirement papers and conclude his term as vice chairman as scheduled in early august			1
@entity109 had long been considered a @entity16 favorite , but had run afoul of other senior officers inside the @entity21 who felt he more than once went behind their backs in offering the president military recommendations and advice on a range of issues , including lower troop levels in @entity47			0
the @entity118 official who is familiar with @entity109 's thinking says the general was aware of these criticisms , and only offered recommendations when asked by the president			2
" there was an impression created he was n't a team player , " said the official , who was offering a defense of @entity109 's actions " gen. @entity109 never believed he was a deputy			2
he believed he had a legal and moral obligation to give the president his best military advice , " the source said			0
" he is not obligated to provide the same advice as everybody else			0
" the official acknowledged the widespread view many had , however , that @entity109 plays his cards close to the vest inside the @entity21 and often shared little with colleagues about his real thinking			0
the official also noted that neither @entity33 nor @entity8 had recommended @entity109 for the job as chairman , which meant his nomination by the @entity16 would have been difficult to justify to @entity169			1
spokesmen for both declined to publicly comment on any aspect of the chairmanship issue			0
@entity109 had also been the subject of an investigation by the department 's inspector general over whistleblower allegations of improper conduct with a junior female officer who fell asleep intoxicated in his hotel room during a business trip			2
he was cleared of wrongdoing by navy secretary @entity184 , but the official said @entity109 felt he was the still the subject of a " whispering campaign " after that			0
@entity1 's @entity189 and @entity190 contributed to this report .			2
