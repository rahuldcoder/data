-- there can be life after death -- or at least in @entity5 politics as we have just seen with the @entity8 's approval of dr. @entity9 as the next @entity5 surgeon general			1
it 's a small political miracle that promises to serve the nation well over the next two years			0
when president @entity14 first nominated dr. @entity9 thirteen months ago , leading public heath officials heartily applauded			1
he was a fresh , dynamic young doctor who had distinguished himself by figuring out better ways to serve low - income patients in poor neighborhoods			0
but opposition quickly mounted outside the medical community			0
republicans had held up his candidacy on two grounds			0
they said that at age 37 , he was too young and inexperienced for the post			0
more importantly , they bowed to the @entity27 , which fiercely opposed @entity9 because he had the temerity to say that guns are a public health issue			1
republicans were wrong on both counts			0
the point is that the @entity27 remains an extraordinary force in our politics			2
as it whipped up opposition , a good number of @entity41 senators , especially those up for re-election this past november , soon buckled to the @entity27 too			1
the @entity44 continued to give @entity9 quiet support but ducked a public fight			1
@entity9 's nomination went into a tailspin and has seemed doomed since april			1
but then a strange thing happened -- by beginning debate on a point of order against @entity14 's immigration executive order , @entity49 sen. @entity49 gave majority leader @entity55 the opportunity to call a special session and put two dozen stalled @entity14 nominees on the agenda for confirmation before the @entity8 recessed			1
as a result , @entity9 was confirmed monday afternoon as the nineteenth @entity5 surgeon general monday afternoon by a 51 - 43 vote			1
( @entity66 sen. @entity65 was the only @entity49 to vote in favor of @entity9			2
) some months ago , one of us ( @entity70 ) had a chance to sit down with @entity9 for a lengthy conversation about his background and his hopes as a possible surgeon general			2
we also explored his leadership capabilities with others in his generation ( including @entity70 's daughter @entity79 , who was his medical school classmate )			0
what emerged was a portrait of a doctor who not only has the quantity of experience necessary but also the quality of experience			0
he is a lifelong advocate for reductions in health disparities , whose focus in the job will be on obesity , smoking , vaccinations and mental health -- pressing health concerns that often break down along racial and socioeconomic lines			0
not only will he be excellent at managing imminent public health crises , but he also promises to be a solutions - oriented , data - driven leader on some of this country 's most intractable health problems			1
as dr. @entity102 , a @entity103 professor and founder of @entity105 , has said : " dr. @entity9 has long experience in community - based care , in communicating complex messages in a straightforward and even - handed manner , and is committed not just to passing on information to others , but to learning from them , too			2
" it is also important to recognize that @entity9 has the resounding support of the medical community , having been endorsed by the @entity116 , the @entity117 , and the @entity118			2
as we saw with the @entity122 crisis , the nation needs a strong public health leader to step into a post that 's been vacant too long			1
@entity5 were , and remain , confused about quarantine requirements and how much risk @entity122 poses			2
people did n't understand why government officials were not mandating quarantines for everyone who had been in contact with @entity122 patients			2
this recent crisis highlights the need for a visible surgeon general who can educate the public during health emergencies			0
as opposed to the @entity140 and the @entity141 , two agencies primarily concerned with academic research , the role of the surgeon general is to be the leading spokesperson on matters of public health in the @entity5 -- " the country 's doctor , " who can be trusted by rich and poor alike			1
the @entity122 crisis demanded a public health official capable of leading in crisis , reassuring @entity5 families that they were safe and advocating for necessary precautions			1
the leadership vacuum is partly responsible for the government 's initial bungling on @entity122 and demonstrates just how important @entity9 's confirmation is			1
if he goes down , the post could be vacant for another year or perhaps even two			0
the root of the @entity27 's opposition to @entity9 , and the subsequent political maneuvering to stall his nomination , stems from an october 2012 tweet in which he wrote , " guns are a health care issue			1
" he was right -- guns are a public health issue			1
we once thought cigarettes were outside the purview of anything but the @entity172 but soon realized that they were a huge health issue			0
guns are too , particularly when over 7,000 young people under age 20 are admitted to @entity5 hospitals every year because of firearm injuries -- about 20 a day			0
it is entirely reasonable for the @entity27 to stand up for its beliefs in people 's rights under the @entity183 -- this country should always welcome robust debate about rights			2
but the gun lobby should not hold a veto power over what is best to protect the public health of our citizens			1
doctors are right to speak out after treating so many gun victims in emergency rooms across the country			0
primary care physicians are right to ask families if they have guns in their homes			0
a lot of young lives can be saved			0
it was especially fitting if the @entity8 were to approve @entity9 on monday , just a day after the second anniversary of the @entity205 shooting in @entity206 , @entity207			1
note : an earlier version of this article gave an incorrect age for @entity9			0
this article has been updated .			0
