@entity0 -- @entity2 says he was n't elected to the @entity3 to stay quiet			1
and his refusal upon entering @entity5 to observe its protocol to sit back and learn like a freshman , as expected , rubbed some of his more senior colleagues the wrong way			0
and while he has angered much of his party over his crusade against president @entity14 's health care law and the government shutdown it could cause , @entity2 says he 's standing for the same principles that got him elected			1
on tuesday , he took that edict to the @entity3 floor in support of his plan to defund @entity21 , saying he would speak " until i am no longer able to stand			1
" and on wednesday morning , he was still talking			0
as the hours dragged on , @entity2 addressed his daughters , apologized for not being home to read them a book , and read to them from the @entity3 floor			1
after reading dr. @entity29 ' " @entity28 , " he said it was applicable to @entity21			1
" president @entity14 and @entity3 @entity32 told the @entity34 people just try @entity21			1
just try it , " he said			0
@entity2 will have to stop talking soon			1
his marathon appearance is not an official filibuster			0
it will not do anything to block @entity21 funding because a key procedural vote on the issue was already scheduled for wednesday			1
his efforts will have to awkwardly come to an end when the vote he is fighting against is called			0
a senator -- usually a freshman is tasked with the duty -- always has to be presiding over the @entity3 during session			1
and a displeased sen. @entity49 , @entity50 , tweeted his annoyance after walking into the @entity3 chamber for his midnight two - hour shift			1
" walking into @entity54 to take 11 - 1 shift presiding over the @entity3 for this pointless fairy tale non-filibuster , " he tweeted			2
critics are questioning @entity2 's motives : is this about his principles or about presidential aspirations ? @entity1 political analyst @entity62 said his @entity64 detractors think @entity2 is putting his political career above all else			2
" while many others have , no doubt , come to the @entity3 in the past as a springboard to the presidency , it 's hard to recall someone who has created as much controversy within his own party , " she said			1
@entity2 has been in @entity0 for less than a year , but his short stint has been an effective lesson in partisan politics			2
only history will tell , however , if his tactics will be worth repeating			0
the @entity81 @entity64 's counterparts in the @entity82 have tried 42 times to roll back @entity21 , but their efforts have gone nowhere in the @entity32 - controlled @entity3			1
@entity2 has upped the ante			1
his latest battle to disrupt @entity21 is tied to funding the government in the new fiscal year that starts on october 1			1
the @entity82 passed the measure last week			0
but @entity3 @entity32 are not about to allow the health care bill to be unraveled , therefore putting at risk a government shutdown			1
@entity2 's refusal to give up the fight has rankled many of his fellow republicans , widening divisions in a splintered party			1
democrats , meanwhile , are sitting back and watching the intraparty fight			0
who is this guy ? his effectiveness at political debate has landed @entity2 in many successful places			2
he was elected to the @entity3 in 2012 , after rebuking the @entity64 establishment and winning the @entity64 primary , paving the way to a general election victory			1
previously , he was the youngest solicitor general of @entity81 and has argued multiple cases before the @entity111			0
he got his start at @entity113 as head of the debate team and then honed his skill at @entity117			0
what 's his fight ? @entity2 did not take his @entity3 responsibilities lightly			1
as a freshman , he refused to stand on the sidelines until he gained a measure of seniority , a common tradition in @entity0			0
instead , he was loud and opinionated			0
" i find it amusing that those in @entity0 are puzzled when someone actually does what they said they would do , " @entity2 told @entity1 in february			2
" at the end of the day , i was elected to represent 26 million @entity132 and to speak the truth			0
you know , i think a lot of @entity34 are tired of politicians in @entity0 in both parties who play games			0
@entity2 was elected , promising to shrink government , especially the new health care law			1
that battle has been embraced by most @entity64 in @entity5 , but his latest tactic has frustrated many			2
political novice ? @entity146 rep. @entity145 has been an outspoken critic of @entity2 's latest crusade â € ” at one point calling him a " fraud			1
" " whether it 's @entity151 , whether it 's kamikaze , or whether it 's @entity152 or whatever , we are going to lose this , " the @entity146 @entity64 said on @entity1 's " @entity150 " last week			0
and @entity155 sen. @entity155 of @entity156 tweeted that he " did n't go to @entity117 or @entity113 " but that he " can count " that @entity32 outnumber @entity64 in the @entity3			1
but @entity2 said to let his critics talk			2
" if you get outside of @entity0 , there is a frustration with @entity0 that is palpable			0
when you ask your constituents what are the problems you 're facing , over and over again , the answer that comes back is @entity21 is killing jobs , is taking away my health insurance , is driving up my premiums , is causing small businesses to shrink , to go out of business			2
if we listen to the @entity34 people , that should be our priorities , " he told @entity1 this week			0
still , republicans are frustrated by his insistence on fighting a divisive , losing battle			0
' do n't break filibuster ' " we are giving @entity14 the escape out , " @entity64 strategist @entity178 said on @entity1 's " @entity179			0
" " instead of now focusing on the problems with @entity21 , everybody 's focused on the civil war in the @entity64			2
" @entity184 also noted the numerous polls , including @entity1 's latest poll , that said while citizens are concerned about @entity21 , they do n't support shutting down the government over it			1
" if you want to fix @entity21 or repeal it or fix it or change it , the best way to do it is to elect more republicans			2
and the political cost of a government shutdown is really going to affect any -- any possibility of electing more republicans , " @entity184 added			2
or political genius ? while @entity2 is ruffling the feathers of his colleagues in @entity0 , he is mobilizing the grass roots outside the @entity201			2
conservative groups are praising him			0
" senator @entity2 came to @entity0 to advance conservative policies , not play by the same old rules that have relegated conservatives , and their ideas , to the back bench , " @entity203 , president of @entity204 , recently said about @entity2			1
his group helps activate grass - roots republicans for conservative candidates and political causes			0
and @entity64 candidates running against @entity64 incumbents in the primaries are using @entity2 's crusade in their races			1
@entity219 , who is running for @entity3 to replace top @entity3 @entity64 @entity220 , said in a statement that he would support " conservatives like sen. @entity2 in his fight to defund @entity21			1
" obamacare : can it be stopped ? @entity219 bashed @entity227 for coming out against @entity2 's effort to shut down the government in order to stop @entity21			1
like so many other crucial fights , @entity220 has caved to ( @entity232 ) @entity233 on @entity21 and is refusing to fight to defund this disastrous legislation			2
" and longtime sen. @entity235 of @entity236 came out in support of @entity2			2
he is facing @entity238 , the daughter of former vice president @entity239 , in a contentious primary			0
will @entity2 be scarred or be a star ? @entity2 could alienate his colleagues to a point where he becomes marginalized and completely ineffective in @entity0			0
he has also hinted at a possible presidential run in 2016			0
if he has no @entity64 support , he risks being cut off from its financing and other resources			0
on the other hand , @entity2 's principled stand could help to grow a movement of disenchanted conservative voters			0
if a groundswell of conservative grass - roots activists grows between now and 2016 -- and their financial support grows , too -- @entity2 could have carved out a path to the @entity64 nomination			0
" i think what senator @entity2 understands is that he has more to gain from adhering to his principles , staying in touch with the grass roots here and around the country , than he does being friends with other senators , " said @entity259 , a leading @entity81 tea party activist who worked to get @entity2 elected			1
@entity2 calls for backup plan			0

@entity2 does n't follow @entity3 rules , irritating traditionalists on both sides of the aisle
*unapologetic* , @entity2 says he was elected to do a job that includes shrinking government
@entity2 ups ante in battle to derail @entity21 , but will he chart new course or *stumble* ?
latest crusade that *threatens* shutdown frustrates many , including some in his own party
