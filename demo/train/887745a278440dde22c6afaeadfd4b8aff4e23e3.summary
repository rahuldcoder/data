-- when a group halfway around the world , without setting foot on @entity6 soil , can claim responsibility for preventing a man in @entity9 , @entity10 , or a woman in @entity12 , @entity13 , from gaining online access to his or her own money in the local bank , it would seem to be a pretty big deal			1
that is allegedly what happened in recent weeks , as six big @entity6 banks had their websites jammed , one after another , preventing their customers from logging on to their personal or business accounts , and from paying bills online			1
the banks affected were @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity34			1
a hacker group , saying it was based in the @entity36 , asserted it was behind the cyberattacks ; it remains uncertain whether they , or someone else , carried out the attacks			1
and , last week , @entity41 reported : " @entity43 press secretary @entity42 downplayed a report that @entity46 hackers had infiltrated a secure national security network used to control nuclear codes , saying the perpetrators breached an ' unclassified ' system			2
" there is ' no indication whatsoever that exfiltration of data ' occurred , he told reporters			2
such attacks , he added , ' are not infrequent			0
' " any time the prefix " cyber " appears in front of another word -- cybercrime ; cyberterrorism ; cyberwarfare -- it can have the effect of making the concept seem slightly less substantial			1
it 's sort of like when the word " virtual " precedes a standard - issue noun : virtual reality is not reality ; a virtual store is distinct from a brick - and - mortar operation			1
opinion : smartphone of the future will be in your brain but as we live more and more of our lives online , and as basic needs such as electricity , water supply , transportation and communication depend increasingly on digital commands , the distinction is rapidly disappearing			1
disrupt the digital world and you disrupt real lives -- you throw daily existence into uncharted territory			1
after the terrorist attacks of september 11 , 2001 , we were told that there had been ample warning signs that went unheeded			0
if there ever is a concerted and darkly effective cyberattack on the @entity6 -- one that robs millions of people of baseline necessities -- we wo n't be able to say that no one told us this might someday happen			1
we have been told , for years			0
in 1997 , according to a report in the @entity105 that year , a @entity43 commission found that the @entity6 was vulnerable to computer - based attacks " upon crucial industries like electrical power , telecommunications , transportation and significant centers of the economy			1
" the concern appeared to be shared by people on both sides of the political aisle			0
at a 2004 @entity121 subcommittee session , @entity118 sen. @entity117 of @entity119 said : " we do n't take cyberterrorism as seriously as we should			0
a terrorist could theoretically use a computer to open up floodgates of a dam , disrupt the operations of an aircraft control tower or shut down the @entity129			0
" @entity131 sen. @entity130 of @entity132 , at the same hearing , said : " we 've seen reports that @entity135 has explored the possibility of damaging some of our key computer systems , seeking to cripple electric power grids , transportation systems , even financial institutions			0
just imagine what chaos would result if a cyberattack were coordinated with a more conventional strike , such as bombing a highly populated area and then tampering with emergency systems to thwart hospitals and first responders caring for wounded civilians			0
" opinion : bias in science holds women back fbi director @entity153 , at a speech in @entity155 earlier this year , said : " state - sponsored hackers are patient and calculating			0
they have the time , the money and the resources to burrow in , and to wait			1
they may come and go , conducting reconnaissance and exfiltrating bits of seemingly innocuous information -- information that in the aggregate may be of high value			1
" the @entity167 operates programs that include the @entity169 , the @entity170 and a security exercise known as @entity172			0
yet with all this , most of us -- as thoroughly as we have come to depend upon digital technology -- do n't have much of an idea about how it really works			1
if your car wo n't start , you may feel qualified to pop open the hood and try to figure out how to fix it ; if your lights go out , you probably know where the fuse box is			0
digital outages are more mysterious ; when systems go dead , there is a feeling of low - grade helplessness , but usually the confidence that someone , somewhere , is working to bring them back to life			2
thus , the specter of some future cyberattack is troubling precisely because most of us have little sense of how we would individually combat such an incident			0
even the terminology is open to dispute			0
the other afternoon i reached internet security expert @entity201 in @entity203 , where he was attending a conference			0
i knew he was skeptical about what he considers the inflation of language surrounding computer - based threats , especially terms like " cyber warfare			2
" opinion : dangerous new world of drones " war is bombs dropping on you , " he told me			2
" @entity216 is tanks in your city			0
@entity216 is not your computer being hacked			2
in any war , there will be a cyberspace component			0
wars are fought on all fronts			0
and cybercrime -- crime -- happens a lot			1
but that is not war			0
" still , as the @entity105 reported from @entity231 , @entity232 , over the summer : " the top @entity6 military official responsible for defending the @entity6 against cyberattacks said thursday that there had been a 17-fold increase in computer attacks on @entity6 infrastructure between 2009 and 2011 , initiated by criminal gangs , hackers and other nations			2
" the assessment by gen. @entity243 , who heads the @entity244 and also the newly created @entity245 , appears to be the government 's first official acknowledgment of the pace at which @entity6 's electricity grids , water supplies , computer and cellphone networks and other infrastructure are coming under attack			2
" meanwhile , there 's the matter of those six major banks , and the customers who could n't log on to get to their money			1
it may all be cyber , but it 's starting to feel kind of real			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity263 .			1

@entity263 : six banks apparently were hacked recently , cutting customer access to money
he says for many " cyber " is like " virtual " -- *intangible* , not real . more and more , that 's not true
he says as *aspects* of our lives bound to digital world , we **'re** vulnerable to cybercrime
@entity263 : officials agree we **'re** *inadequately* *protected* , and cyberattacks are up . it 's real
