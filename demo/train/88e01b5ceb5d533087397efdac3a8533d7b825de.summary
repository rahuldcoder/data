@entity0 , @entity1 -- the little girl paused , then answered my questions : " i 'm 7			1
" her hair was in braided pigtails			2
she wore a fancy dress			2
the girl had taken a seat in the folding chair next to mine after guards led another small group into the brightly lit room			2
we were in the post-security visitation area of the @entity20 , a privately run federal immigration facility in south @entity1			1
behind us was a plain wall			2
in front were five sparse booths , open to the room , offering little privacy			2
each booth had a chair and a large black telephone			2
thick glass separated the booths from men who milled about on the other side			0
the men wore different colored jumpsuits : some blue , some orange , some red			0
like the older woman , an aunt perhaps , who accompanied her into the room , the little girl to my right was visibly nervous			0
this was her first trip to the detention center			1
i told the girl about my own second - grader in an effort to get her mind off our surroundings			0
i 'm quite certain i failed			0
after several minutes , a man in his late 20s sat down on the other side of the glass			0
he picked up a phone			0
the little girl walked up , studied another phone for a moment , and carefully raised it to the side of her head			0
her greeting was straightforward : " hi , @entity63			0
" i could n't hear what her father said in reply			0
i could see his wistful smile , though , and tears rolling down his cheeks			0
* * every day , our immigration laws are breaking apart families of many citizens living in the @entity74			1
it 's good news that , as a bipartisan group of @entity74 senators seeks consensus on a plan for comprehensive immigration reform , one focus is on so - called " family reunification " preferences in our law			1
the senators are debating whether , and to what extent , our immigration policies should give priority to admitting family members of immigrant citizens -- their spouses , children and siblings -- still living abroad			1
but while family reunification is an important consideration , that issue avoids the larger point dramatized at the @entity20 about the harmful impact of @entity74 immigration policy on families already here			1
more than 1.5 million unauthorized immigrants have been removed from the @entity74 since president @entity103 took office in 2009 , according to the federal government 's statistics			1
approximately 410,000 were removed last year alone			0
these numbers present an important question : who are the immigrants we are deporting ? yes , some are dangerous criminals who need to be arrested , prosecuted and removed through deportation			2
living in the @entity74 without legal status does not , however , amount to criminality			1
the @entity116 noted this last year when it wrote , " as a general rule , it is not a crime for a removable alien to remain present in the @entity74			1
" overstaying a visa , for example , is a civil violation and not a criminal one			2
the offenses that can trigger incarceration at detention centers like the one i visited recently include traffic violations such as driving without a valid license			1
this may seem like a matter of semantics to some , but incarcerating nonviolent immigrants carries real costs to the country and to the immigrants ' family members who are , in many cases , @entity74 citizens			1
many present - day immigrants live among us in what researchers call " mixed status " households			0
approximately 9 million people live in these modern @entity74 families that include both citizens and unauthorized immigrants			1
the result is that @entity74 - citizen family members are frequently left behind when immigrants are deported			1
contrary to popular belief , marriage to a @entity74 citizen does not automatically confer legal status on unauthorized immigrants			1
while marriage can provide a pathway to legal residency , that path is often long and can be overrun with bureaucratic pit stops			0
in many instances , our laws require immigrant spouses to return to their home countries and remain there for as long as 10 years before reunification is permitted			0
these extended bars to re-entry apply , for example , to @entity173 nationals who arrived in this country after 2001 without authorization even if they are married to a @entity74 citizen			1
in that way , our current immigration laws give some @entity74 citizens a distressing choice : either extended separation from their immediate families or extended separation from this country			1
an emerging bipartisan consensus acknowledges that our immigration laws are broken and need to be reformed , in a comprehensive way , at the federal level			1
as @entity189 tackles this issue , we should acknowledge that reform can benefit more than the immigrants living among us			2
it can benefit @entity74 children who attend school with our kids , @entity74 men who share pews at our churches , and @entity74 women sitting beside us in office cubicles , by keeping their families together			1
done right , immigration reform can strengthen our economy , uphold our values and preserve the family units of many @entity74 citizens			1
* * before entering the @entity20 , all visitors must fill out paperwork disclosing their immigration status			2
i did n't see the form of the little girl i met in the visitation room , of course , or ask the question as we chatted briefly			0
given her family 's willingness to bring her inside the barbed wire gates of the facility , however , it 's safe to assume that she is a native - born citizen			0
she 's as @entity74 as my grandfather , who grew up on @entity227 farmland in the early 1900s , and who spoke nothing but @entity230 at home until the start of @entity233 as my four children			1
the little girl was among many @entity74 citizens who visit family member inmates at the detention center			1
on the day of my visit , at the other end of the room , a woman in her 40s sat in the corner booth			0
she saved up gas money and drove more than 300 miles for this chance to have a one - hour visit with her husband			0
born and raised in western @entity249 , she lives on land that was owned by her father , and her father 's father before him			0
she met her husband in a thrift store in her hometown			0
in the visitation room , the woman held a phone and spoke to her husband in @entity262 with a country twang			0
what she wanted most that day was the chance to touch his hand , just for a moment , through the glass			0
that was a chance she did n't get			0
without changes to our federal immigration laws , more husbands and fathers , and wives and mothers , of @entity74 citizens will be deported			1
more @entity74 children will be raised outside the presence of a parent 's love and financial support			1
and more @entity74 -- like the woman i saw pressing the palm of her hand against cold glass in a detention center booth -- may not have the chance to touch their spouses again			1
at least not in our country			0
at least not anytime soon			0
the current immigration system does not make our nation , or our families , stronger			2
we can reform our immigration laws in a way that brings hardworking people out of the shadows and keeps families together			1
that is , or at least should be , the @entity74 way			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity307 .			2

@entity307 visited a privately run immigration detention center in @entity1
he says it was clear that families with @entity74 citizens were broken *due* to detention process
people who commit civil violations are treated as criminals , he says
@entity307 : immigration reform needs to include provisions to *protect* families
