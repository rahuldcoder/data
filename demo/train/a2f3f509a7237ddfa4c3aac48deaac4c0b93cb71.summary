the pilot turned his airliner upside down			2
and it saved nearly a hundred lives			0
that 's the idea behind one of the most intense movie moments of the holiday season : the core scene of " flight , " starring @entity10 as pilot whip @entity11			1
@entity12 sure likes @entity14 's performance			2
the role earned him an @entity18 nomination thursday on the heels of a @entity21 nod in december			0
the film also received a nod for best original screenplay			0
spinning movie sets combine with @entity26 to make the scene " more than gut - wrenching , " wrote @entity28 's @entity27			1
@entity31 ranks it among the " most harrowing plane crashes ever seen			0
" ( by the way , no spoilers here			0
) thanks to masterful editing , we see a series of jerky , split - second glimpses of an " engine failure " panel light and then an uncontrolled dive and a plunging altimeter			0
in a stunning command decision , @entity14 's character rolls the plane over on its back			2
we see tumbling passengers and tossed luggage and finally a smoky crash landing in an empty field			2
the scene stands as a breathtaking masterpiece of @entity12 's dream machine , but it pales in comparison with @entity58 , a deadly real - life airline disaster that -- like the movie --- could have been much worse if not for remarkable efforts by heroic crew members			1
but first , is it possible to fly a commercial airliner upside down ? would excessive g - forces destroy it ? that debate is raging right now on aviation @entity68 feeds and websites			2
in the film , the pilot rolls the plane over to keep it flying longer			2
he avoids crashing into a neighborhood , saving countless lives			0
" flight " director @entity76 , creator of the " @entity79 " series , enjoyed a bit of artistic license here , said @entity83 , the film 's pilot consultant			1
@entity83 , a 32 - year pilot -- first with the @entity86 , then with @entity85 -- trained pilots to fly md - 88s , which the movie 's plane most resembles			1
during production , @entity83 said he reminded @entity76 and @entity14 that " you can turn an airplane like this over , but it 's not going to fly like this very long			1
it 's gon na go down			2
" " he looked at me and he said , ' can it fly upside down for a little bit ? ' i said , ' yeah a little bit , but eventually you 're gon na lose lift in the wings and you wo n't have the power to keep the airplane up			0
' " " it 's hard to do and the planes are n't built for it , " said another veteran commercial airline pilot			1
" but when you 're in that situation you 'll do anything you can to save the airplane , " said the pilot , who asked not to be named because he 's not authorized by his airline to speak with the news media			1
when asked about flying upside down , @entity116 , which inherited the md - 80 series after its 1997 merger with @entity119 , issued a no - nonsense statement			0
" the @entity121 can not sustain inverted flight , " the statement said			2
" the md - 80 , as with all commercial airliners , was designed to fly upright			0
commercial airliners are only tested and certified for upright flight			2
" another thing that did n't ring true with @entity127 was the pilot leaving the cockpit during an emergency , as @entity14 's character did			1
@entity83 said he advised @entity76 this scenario was n't likely			1
the interaction between @entity14 's character and the co-pilot rubbed commercial airline pilot and blogger @entity137 the wrong way			1
" @entity14 's character is arrogant and flip and condescending and his co-pilot 's character is meek and weak and at times even scared and clueless , " said @entity137			2
" this is n't how pilots behave			0
it reinforces the myth that the co-pilot is some sort of apprentice pilot			0
" the real deal but as we all know , there 's @entity12 -- and then there 's the real deal			0
as one commenter on airspacemag.com put it , " @entity12 could learn a lot from true life , i.e. , @entity157 232			0
" that 's because when it comes to a real life loss of airliner flight control , situations do n't get much worse than flight 232			1
@entity166 commanded the @entity167 that hot july day in 1989			1
the plane was about 75 miles north of @entity169 , @entity170 , en route from @entity175 to @entity176 with 11 crew and 285 passengers , when one of the plane 's three engines failed			1
" there was a loud @entity180 , " @entity166 said			1
the bang , he said , " was followed by a large vibration lasting a few seconds			0
" the noise was the sound of a cracked engine fan disk shooting out of the tail engine and freakishly hitting in the worst possible spot			0
the disk severed all the plane 's hydraulic lines , virtually cutting off all steering and speed control			1
read federal investigators ' report on the crash ( @entity197 ) for the next 45 minutes , @entity166 , first officer @entity198 , engineer @entity58 and instructor @entity201 would need all their strength and good ideas to re-invent how to fly the @entity167			1
but unlike the movie , flying upside down was not the solution to escaping this emergency			0
" when the engine failed , the airplane started to turn to the right and started to roll , " said @entity166			1
" if we had not stopped that and it had rolled over on its back , i 'm sure the nose falling down would have increased the airspeed so fast that there 's no way we could have controlled it			0
" " if we had gotten upside down , the party was over			0
" they learned how to steer the plane by adjusting the power in the aircraft 's two remaining engines			0
it was like trying to drive a car without power steering , said @entity166 , only harder			1
the captain and records struggled with the control wheel circling it steadily in right turn circles toward @entity169 airport			1
" it was very tiring , " @entity166 said			1
at the same time , @entity234 struggled on his knees as he was forced to use both hands to muscle the plane 's throttle levers , which also had become hard to move			0
" i 'll tell you what , we 'll have a beer when this is all done , " @entity201 told @entity166 , according to the flight recorder transcript			1
" well , i do n't drink , " the captain replied , " but i 'll sure as hell have one			0
" in the cabin , flight attendants worked to calm passengers and prepare them for a crash landing			1
" one passenger thought she was having a heart attack and the flight attendants calmed her down , and it turned out she was n't having a heart attack , she was just very nervous , " @entity166 said			1
as the plane neared the ground at a much - too - fast speed , passengers were warned to brace for impact			0
video of the @entity167 's fiery cartwheel landing was plastered across tv news channels for months after the disaster			1
" the minute we hit the ground , i was knocked out , " @entity166 recalls			2
" i woke up in the cockpit talking to @entity270 , i only remember bits and pieces of the conversation			0
i remember when the rescuers found us , someone asked , ' are there really four of you in there ? ' " one - hundred - ten passengers and one crew member -- flight attendant @entity282 -- died in the crash			2
one - hundred - eighty - five passengers and crew survived			0
in the months after the disaster , authorities recreated the emergency in flight simulators			2
but the simulator pilots were unable to maintain control of the plane all the way through to landing			0
sometimes life produces real events that rival @entity12 's wildest imaginations			0
that 's what happened in 1989 , when the crew of @entity58 achieved the nearly impossible .			1
