-- for centuries , the @entity1 has required celibacy from its priests			1
it is a vow the @entity6 says not only underscores the commitment of seminarians to their vocation but also is a model of @entity12 's own celibacy			1
but with the election of a new pope , many church watchers are wondering whether church teachings could change to allow all priests to marry			2
abuse victims ' group names preferred picks for new pope currently , the @entity1 allows married @entity23 priests who join the @entity6 to become ordained as priests			1
@entity26 seminarians , meanwhile , must remain celibate , and church leadership seems unlikely to move on the issue			1
@entity30 cardinal @entity29 told @entity0 's @entity31 that while changes to church law on celibacy might be discussed , it is unlikely to change soon			1
" it startles me sometimes ( when people ) say why does n't the church talk about married priests , " he said			0
" i think we talk about it ; i ca n't get my hair cut without my barber asking me about it			0
( but ) i do n't think there would be that kind of change			0
" for a pope , the mission statement is to conserve in the best sense of the word ... preserve the spiritual patrimony of the church , the timeless teaching that 's taught to us from @entity56 to his apostles through 2,000 years of the @entity6			1
" now that does n't mean he might not change the way it 's presented			2
" follow the @entity62 on @entity63 for the @entity1 , the debate on celibacy is nothing new ; it has been going on in various forms since the reformation of the 16th century -- but the past 50 years has put new pressures on the priesthood			1
the @entity1 reaffirmed its commitment to continuing the practice at the height of the social and sexual revolution of the 1960s			1
in 1967 , pope @entity77 , who charted the @entity6 through the difficult shoals of the cultural upheavals of the 1960s , published an encyclical , or open letter to the church , entitled @entity84 ( @entity81 for " of the celibate priesthood " )			1
in it , he outlined the reasons for keeping the tradition of celibacy a part of church teaching : it was a superior way of achieving grace , it freed priests from familial obligations in order to devote themselves to @entity98 , it mirrored heaven as a place without marriage			2
smoke signals : how is a new pope elected ? " in any case , the church of the @entity105 can not weaken her faithful observance of her own tradition , " pope @entity77 wrote at the time			2
@entity110 's most senior @entity6 , cardinal @entity111 , told the @entity112 in february that many priests struggle to cope with celibacy and should be able to marry and have a family			1
just three days later he was forced to resign over allegations of a 30 - year - old sex scandal with seminarians in his charge			0
@entity111 later admitted his conduct had " fallen below the standards " expected of a priest			0
" i 'd be very happy if others had the opportunity of considering whether or not they could or should be married			0
it 's a free world and i realize many priests have found it very difficult to cope with celibacy as they lived out their priesthood , and felt the need of a companion , of a woman , to whom they could get married and raise a family , " he told the @entity110 news agency			1
@entity111 is not the first or the highest ranked @entity26 to question the tradition of priestly celibacy			1
in 1993 , at a weekly audience , even pope @entity138 said celibacy did " not belong to the essence of the priesthood			1
" even so , he qualified this , saying there was " no doubt about its suitability and indeed its appropriateness to the demands of sacred orders			0
" celibacy in the @entity6 is a law , not a doctrine , and can be changed by the pope at any time			1
despite this , pope @entity154 made it clear during his tenure that the traditional practice was unlikely to change			0
the rev. @entity159 , founder and editor of the @entity162 - based conservative @entity26 publishing house @entity161 , told @entity164 's @entity163 in february that while celibacy is a discipline and not a dogma , it made it no less an important part of the @entity6			1
" people say celibacy is only a discipline , but it 's not only a discipline , " he told the radio program			1
" it 's something the church in its wisdom for 2000 years has recognized as a closer , more exact , more profound following of the example @entity56 set us			0
" @entity0 's @entity62 : the faith angles behind the biggest stories in the meantime , the arguments against celibacy have been mounting			2
opponents argue that @entity56 did not require celibacy from his apostles , that sexual repression has led to the sex abuse scandals currently racking the church and that celibacy has been responsible for the dwindling numbers of young men taking up the vocation			1
sister @entity195 of the @entity197 - based catholic reform movement @entity196 believes that celibacy should be made optional			2
" around the world there is a severe shortage of @entity26 priests and over 50,000 churches have no pastor , " she said			2
" while the number of @entity6 is rising , the number of priests is in decline -- mandatory celibacy can deter quality candidates from entering the priesthood			2
" according to the @entity1 yearbook , between 1975 and 2010 the world 's @entity6 increased by 59 % from 709.6 million to 1.96 billion , but the number of priests increased only 1.8 %			1
" in 1975 there were 404,783 priests worldwide compared with 412,000 now			0
forty - six percent of the world 's priests are in @entity219 but only 24 % of @entity6 live there ... and the number is diminishing			0
" it seems her view may be supported by a majority of @entity162 @entity6			0
according to a survey of @entity162 @entity6 by the @entity226 taken after @entity154 announced his resignation , 58 % of congregants favored allowing priests to marry			0
even so , the figures showed the divisive nature of the debate : of those who attend @entity234 regularly , only 46 % supported marriage for priests while 66 % of those who attended less regularly supported marriage			0
what 's in a name ? clues to be found in next pope 's moniker one former seminarian , who did not want to be named because he is still active in the church and not authorized to speak publicly , told @entity0 the vow of chastity was one of the chief reasons he dropped out of the vocation			1
" i had strong issues with celibacy and , at that time , wanted the freedom to get married and did n't know why there could be @entity255 pastors that led perfectly normal family lives and also ran their congregations			2
" i certainly understood the celibate side to priesthood and had a certain respect for it -- strangely i still do -- but i just felt that you should be given options			0
" he said the diocesan college he attended in the @entity162 -- a type of minor seminary -- was designed to prepare students for their commitments at major seminaries if they decided to continue their studies			0
" they were obviously making changes from the middle of the century -- in the ' 30s , ' 40s and ' 50s - when the seminaries were packed full , but probably after the whole peace revolution and the sexual revolution guys obviously started having a lot of second thoughts , " he said			0
he said he saw little evidence of the kind of sexual abuses that have recently come to light and derailed the @entity6			0
" when you 're young , growing up in a big , serious @entity26 family - and i went to a @entity26 grade school , i was essentially raised , socialized and educated by nuns and priests - that has a very deep impact especially if they 're good role models			2
" i never had any sleazy nuns or priests when i was growing up , at least none that i knew about , " he said			0
" when you 've got such good role models , both nuns and priests , who are celibate , that makes a big mark on you			0

celibacy in the @entity26 priesthood still a *contentious* issue
@entity1 says the vow underscores a priest 's commitment to his vocation
opponents say celibacy should be optional , citing low seminary numbers
speculation strong about whether a new pope will keep the discipline of celibacy
