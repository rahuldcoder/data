the @entity0 late saturday issued a detailed synopsis , or " fact sheet , " of the six - month deal regarding @entity5 's nuclear program			1
@entity7 ) below is a copy of the agreement 's details , verbatim from the @entity0 : halting the progress of @entity5 's program and rolling back key elements @entity5 has committed to halt enrichment above 5 % : halt all enrichment ( above 5 % and dismantle the technical connections required to enrich above 5 %			1
@entity5 has committed to neutralize its stockpile of near - 20 % uranium : dilute below 5 % or convert to a form not suitable for further enrichment its entire stockpile of near - 20 % enriched uranium before the end of the initial phase			2
@entity5 has committed to halt progress on its enrichment capacity : not install additional centrifuges of any type			1
not install or use any next - generation centrifuges to enrich uranium			0
leave inoperable roughly half of installed centrifuges at @entity33 and three - quarters of installed centrifuges at @entity35 , so they can not be used to enrich uranium			0
limit its centrifuge production to those needed to replace damaged machines , so @entity5 can not use the six months to stockpile centrifuges			2
not construct additional enrichment facilities			0
20 questions about the deal @entity5 has committed to halt progress on the growth of its 3.5 % stockpile : not increase its stockpile of 3.5 % low enriched uranium , so that the amount is not greater at the end of the six months than it is at the beginning , and any newly enriched 3.5 % enriched uranium is converted into oxide			1
@entity5 has committed to no further advances of its activities at @entity59 and to halt progress on its plutonium track			1
@entity5 has committed to : not commission the @entity59 reactor			2
not fuel the @entity59 reactor			0
halt the production of fuel for the @entity59 reactor			0
no additional testing of fuel for the @entity59 reactor			0
not install any additional reactor components at @entity59			0
not transfer fuel and heavy water to the reactor site			0
not construct a facility capable of reprocessing			0
without reprocessing , @entity5 can not separate plutonium from spent fuel			2
@entity76 : what critics are getting wrong about the @entity5 deal unprecedented transparency and intrusive monitoring of @entity5 's nuclear program @entity5 has committed to : provide daily access by @entity84 inspectors at @entity33 and @entity35			1
this daily access will permit inspectors to review surveillance camera footage to ensure comprehensive monitoring			0
this access will provide even greater transparency into enrichment at these sites and shorten detection time for any non-compliance			0
provide @entity84 access to centrifuge assembly facilities			0
provide @entity84 access to centrifuge rotor component production and storage facilities			0
provide @entity84 access to uranium mines and mills			0
provide long - sought design information for the @entity59 reactor			0
this will provide critical insight into the reactor that has not previously been available			0
provide more frequent inspector access to the @entity59 reactor			0
provide certain key data and information called for in the @entity108 to @entity5 's @entity109 and @entity110 3.1			1
one agreement , wildly different reactions verification mechanism the @entity84 will be called upon to perform many of these verification steps , consistent with their ongoing inspection role in @entity5			2
in addition , the @entity116 and @entity5 have committed to establishing a @entity118 to work with the @entity84 to monitor implementation and address issues that may arise			1
the @entity118 will also work with the @entity84 to facilitate resolution of past and present concerns with respect to @entity5 's nuclear program , including the possible military dimension of @entity5 's nuclear program and @entity5 's activities at @entity128			1
limited , temporary , reversible relief in return for these steps , the @entity116 is to provide limited , temporary , targeted , and reversible relief while maintaining the vast bulk of our sanctions , including the oil , finance , and banking sanctions architecture			1
if @entity5 fails to meet its commitments , we will revoke the relief			1
specifically the @entity116 has committed to : not impose new nuclear - related sanctions for six months , if @entity5 abides by its commitments under this deal , to the extent permissible within their political systems			1
suspend certain sanctions on gold and precious metals , @entity5 's auto sector , and @entity5 's petrochemical exports , potentially providing @entity5 approximately $ 1.5 billion in revenue			1
license safety - related repairs and inspections inside @entity5 for certain @entity5 airlines			2
allow purchases of @entity5 oil to remain at their currently significantly reduced levels -- levels that are 60 % less than two years ago			2
$ 4.2 billion from these sales will be allowed to be transferred in installments if , and as , @entity5 fulfills its commitments			2
allow $ 400 million in governmental tuition assistance to be transferred from restricted @entity5 funds directly to recognized educational institutions in third countries to defray the tuition costs of @entity5 students			0
opinion : @entity5 deal a risk worth taking humanitarian transactions facilitate humanitarian transactions that are already allowed by @entity172 law			1
humanitarian transactions have been explicitly exempted from sanctions by @entity175 so this channel will not provide @entity5 access to any new source of funds			0
humanitarian transactions are those related to @entity5 's purchase of food , agricultural commodities , medicine , medical devices ; we would also facilitate transactions for medical expenses incurred abroad			1
we will establish this channel for the benefit of the @entity5 people			0
putting limited relief in perspective in total , the approximately $ 7 billion in relief is a fraction of the costs that @entity5 will continue to incur during this first phase under the sanctions that will remain in place			2
the vast majority of @entity5 's approximately $ 100 billion in foreign exchange holdings are inaccessible or restricted by sanctions			1
in the next six months , @entity5 's crude oil sales can not increase			1
oil sanctions alone will result in approximately $ 30 billion in lost revenues to @entity5 -- or roughly $ 5 billion per month -- compared to what @entity5 earned in a six month period in 2011 , before these sanctions took effect			0
while @entity5 will be allowed access to $ 4.2 billion of its oil sales , nearly $ 15 billion of its revenues during this period will go into restricted overseas accounts			0
in summary , we expect the balance of @entity5 's money in restricted accounts overseas will actually increase , not decrease , under the terms of this deal			1
@entity223 : @entity224 is safe under new deal maintaining economic pressure on @entity5 and preserving our sanctions architecture during the first phase , we will continue to vigorously enforce our sanctions against @entity5 , including by taking action against those who seek to evade or circumvent our sanctions			2
sanctions affecting crude oil sales will continue to impose pressure on @entity5 's government			1
working with our international partners , we have cut @entity5 's oil sales from 2.5 million barrels per day ( bpd ) in early 2012 to 1 million bpd today , denying @entity5 the ability to sell almost 1.5 million bpd			1
that 's a loss of more than $ 80 billion since the beginning of 2012 that @entity5 will never be able to recoup			2
under this first step , the @entity244 crude oil ban will remain in effect and @entity5 will be held to approximately 1 million bpd in sales , resulting in continuing lost sales worth an additional $ 4 billion per month , every month , going forward			0
sanctions affecting petroleum product exports to @entity5 , which result in billions of dollars of lost revenue , will remain in effect			0
the vast majority of @entity5 's approximately $ 100 billion in foreign exchange holdings remain inaccessible or restricted by our sanctions			1
other significant parts of our sanctions regime remain intact , including : -- sanctions against the @entity259 and approximately two dozen other major @entity5 banks and financial actors ; -- secondary sanctions , pursuant to the @entity263 ( @entity263 ) as amended and other laws , on banks that do business with @entity172 - designated individuals and entities ; -- sanctions on those who provide a broad range of other financial services to @entity5 , such as many types of insurance ; and , -- restricted access to the @entity172 financial system			0
all sanctions on over 600 individuals and entities targeted for supporting @entity5 's nuclear or ballistic missile program remain in effect			1
sanctions on several sectors of @entity5 's economy , including shipping and shipbuilding , remain in effect			1
sanctions on long - term investment in and provision of technical services to @entity5 's energy sector remain in effect			1
sanctions on @entity5 's military program remain in effect			1
broad @entity172 restrictions on trade with @entity5 remain in effect , depriving @entity5 of access to virtually all dealings with the world 's biggest economy			2
all @entity306 @entity305 sanctions remain in effect			0
all of our targeted sanctions related to @entity5 's state sponsorship of terrorism , its destabilizing role in the @entity313 conflict , and its abysmal human rights record , among other concerns , remain in effect			1
