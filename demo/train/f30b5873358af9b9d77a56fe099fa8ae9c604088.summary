@entity0 , @entity1 -- on wednesday , @entity3 unveiled @entity4 , its motion - sensitive controller			2
a small device that looks like a microphone -- but with something on top of it that looks like a ping pong ball with an led inside -- move is @entity3 's bid to gain control over the motion controller wars that are currently led by @entity16 , with its @entity18 controller , and which many think will be dominated by @entity20 and its @entity22 controller system			1
to @entity3 , releasing the move is an obvious move for the @entity25 , given it believes it started the motion controller era with its @entity28			1
@entity3 held its press conference during the @entity30 here			2
now , the move , which will be available this fall in a starter kit that begins at under $ 100 for a move , a @entity25 eye camera and a game , is its attempt to jump ahead of @entity20 's @entity37 and to begin winning over @entity18 users			1
" we like to think that the migration path between @entity18 households and @entity25 households is a natural path , " said @entity39 , @entity3 's senior vice president for marketing and @entity25			1
@entity45 , @entity3 's president for worldwide studios , said @entity4 will " demonstrate that the motion controller for @entity48 will be the solution for both casual and hard - core gamers alike " and that the types of games @entity3 can create with it are " amazingly diverse			1
" among the types of games move will work with include those that involve swords , bows and arrows , guns , punching and much more			2
the idea is that @entity4 will provide players with a realistic and precise feeling of holding whatever kind of thing the game calls for , be it a sword or a gun			2
@entity3 first talked about its new motion controller at @entity69 last year but did n't have a name or any kind of timing			0
now , by unveiling the device 's name it can begin what @entity39 said will be the company 's biggest video game marketing effort of the year			0
while @entity3 is expecting consumers to use move with a range of brand - new games , the company also clearly thinks that it will enhance game play in existing titles			1
as such , it showed off how move can be used to move characters around in its hit title , @entity87			0
further , the controller comes with its own accessory , known as a sub-controller , which will accentuate what 's possible with @entity4			0
and later this year , the forthcoming game @entity92 will incorporate both move and the sub-controller			0
