@entity0 , @entity1 -- is it a plane ? is it a drone ? next time you look up and see vapor trails spreading across the sky , bear in mind that the aircraft you 're looking at might just be both			1
as the aviation industry tightens its belt , its attempts to save money and stay relevant have led to a new rise of " transformers " -- including crop - dusters and business jets given a new lease of life as surveillance aircraft			1
with the financial crisis continuing to bite -- not least in the @entity29 defense sector -- more and more aircraft manufacturers are trying to secure their future by turning older aviation staples into innovative new ones , creating a new breed of " transformers			1
" in a former life , @entity36 's @entity35 was a business jet ( the @entity39 ) , used to ferry well - to - do travelers to and from high - powered meetings or red carpet events			2
today the twin - engine turboprop is being turned into a drone , with surveillance equipment and remote flying systems replacing the nine passengers and pilot			1
unveiling the new - look aircraft at last week 's @entity51 , @entity36 's ceo @entity49 said the @entity35 -- which the company expects to be approved for use by 2014 -- offered " an insight into what an advanced @entity55 [ @entity55 ] of the future will look like			1
" @entity59 's @entity58 , also on display at @entity0 is , the company says , a border patrol aircraft designed to provide " airborne surveillance for intelligence and security			1
" but in its slightly more down - to - earth pre-modification past , the aircraft was originally conceived as the @entity69 , an agricultural crop - duster			1
also joining the hybrid ranks at the @entity51 was @entity72 , the plane that thinks it is a drone			1
or is that be the other way around ? the aircraft , designed for surveillance missions , can be flown remotely as a uav by a ground - based operator , or in the traditional way with a pilot at the controls			1
its creators , @entity29 - based @entity84 , say it takes @entity72 's two - man crew just four hours to switch the plane from one mode of flying to the other			1
@entity91 , international defense editor of @entity92 , said the trend for turning existing aircraft into others , rather than creating them from scratch , was down to two main reasons : the financial crisis , and the end of the @entity100			1
both mean that completely new aircraft are not being designed as often as they have done in the past			0
" instead companies are modernizing , adapting aircraft they 've already got to allow them to do something different , because the industry 's needs now are very different to what they were during the @entity100 , and they will be something different again in the next 10 years or so , " he told @entity2			2
" it is proving very hard to get the @entity116 to approve a simpler , cheaper aircraft designed from the start to be unmanned , " said @entity114 , @entity92 's technology editor			0
" instead it is easier to take an aircraft that the @entity116 has already certificated for manned flight , and take the pilot out of it , " he said			0
" if a company takes an existing aircraft -- which they know flies , works , is safe and reliable -- and converts that into an unmanned vehicle , that allows them to develop it much more quickly , " said @entity91			2
and then there 's @entity132 , an entirely different sort of " transformer			0
" this super-futuristic looking electric - powered aircraft is formed of a graceful aerodynamic swoosh of carbon fibre enclosing a cockpit ( like the drones above , it has so far only been flown unmanned ) and two massive rotor blades			1
it is these rotor blades which are the secret to the aircraft 's groundbreaking nature			0
facing the ground , they allow @entity132 to take off vertically , like a helicopter			0
but once in the air , the rotors can be tilted , enabling it to fly forwards like a traditional plane			0
@entity132 , which has been in the works -- but firmly under wraps -- for several years , was unveiled at this week 's @entity51			0
@entity157 , @entity158 's vice president of research and technology , who oversaw work on the aircraft , said it was designed " to be as radical as possible , " reflecting the motto of the advanced project group behind it : " ' live to dream ' - if it can be dreamed , it can be built			2
" just how high and how fast the aircraft is capable of flying is still a closely - guarded secret , but @entity157 insists " it works , we have flown this thing			2
" there 's just one catch though -- despite being proven to work in flight tests , @entity132 is not likely to go into production any time soon			0
instead it is intended as a " technology incubator , " a way of trialing and showcasing all the latest innovations at once			0
still , the company hopes that even if we 're not going to be flying a @entity132 within the next 10 years , some of the technology it has helped develop will become the norm on more everyday aircraft			0
" @entity132 might or might not make the basis for a future uav or form of transport , but it 's the parts in there that are important , that have potential , " says @entity91			0
and that could help to transform the whole industry , not just one aircraft .			2

aviation manufacturers are turning older aircraft into drones
an agricultural crop - duster can be transformed into an airborne surveillance machine
it takes just four hours to switch the @entity72 aircraft from a plane into a @entity55
a new breed of " transformers " could change the whole industry
