@entity0 -- you 've answered the call for volunteers , signed up for the @entity6 trip and you are looking forward to boldly going to space , the final frontier , to explore a strange new world			1
recent evidence from @entity12 's curiosity rover mission to the @entity6 has revealed that astronauts on the round - trip would be exposed to high levels of radiation from cosmic rays and high - energy particles from the sun contained in solar storms			1
@entity12 says a @entity6 voyager would receive a radiation dose around 100 times the average yearly exposure on @entity24			1
along with all the other risks of spaceflight , this would clearly be bad for your health -- and it is proving difficult to find a solution			0
@entity30 , a radiation health expert at @entity12 's @entity32 , told @entity1 that shielding to completely block the radiation danger would have to be " meters thick " and too heavy to be used aboard a spacecraft			1
in contrast , with the release of the @entity38 movie " @entity39 , " science fiction fans have once again got used to the ease with which @entity42 gives the order for " shields up " and the crew of the @entity46 being protected instantly from the hostility of space			2
perhaps though , a real @entity38 shield may no longer be science fiction -- scientists at the @entity53 's @entity52 ( @entity52 ) certainly think so			1
radiation ' potential showstopper ' they have been testing a lightweight system to protect astronauts and spacecraft components from harmful radiation and working with colleagues in @entity62 to design a concept spaceship called @entity64 that could take astronauts to the @entity66 or @entity6			1
" @entity38 has great ideas -- they just do n't have to build it , " said @entity67 , lead researcher for the deflector shield project at @entity52			1
" the radiation problem is a potential showstopper			2
i 'm very concerned that the radiation issue is not being addressed very publicly and it 's absolutely key			2
" even if astronauts are sick for 3 - 4 days , it could still threaten the mission because the whole crew are affected -- and vomiting and diarrhea in space is no joke			1
it could also potentially lead to organ failure , " said @entity67			0
the @entity52 plan is to create an environment around the spacecraft that mimics the @entity24 's magnetic field and recreates the protection we enjoy on the ground -- they call it a mini magnetosphere			2
" on @entity24 , mostly we 're protected by the atmosphere but ultimately what the @entity24 's magnetic field is doing is forming a first line of protection for life , " explained @entity67			0
" the concept behind what we 're suggesting is due to the evolution in our understanding of plasmas			0
what we discovered is that if you put a magnetic field around an object in a flowing plasma , the electrons , which are very light , will follow the new magnetic field that you 've put there but the ions , the very fast ions , will overshoot -- they wo n't follow the magnetic field lines			0
" you end up with a constant electric field that can be enough that it actually refracts or deflects enough of the radiation from inside the magnetic cavity that you 've formed to protect the astronauts ... enough like the @entity24 that they can survive			2
" the mini-magnetosphere concept has also been proposed by a team at the @entity127 in the @entity62 as a way of harnessing the solar wind to create a propulsion system			1
other shielding ideas are also being explored			0
the @entity132 that is committed to sending a crew to @entity6 has proposed lining the spacecraft 's walls with water , food and even human waste to help protect the astronauts			1
early results ' pleasing ' @entity142 magazine recently reported that the " hydrocarbons in excrement and food are good candidates for radiation shielding			0
" it added : " @entity12 's @entity150 project uses a similar concept , but inspiration must make it work for real			1
" as a child , @entity67 was inspired to explore a scientific career by the @entity156 moon landings and is a fan of the @entity38 series			0
she believes the concepts explored in the science fiction films are a useful shorthand for scientists when trying to explain their work			0
the @entity52 deflector shield she has helped to develop has been tested on a model inside a fusion reactor which produces a plasma like that of the solar wind			1
@entity67 said they were delighted with the results			0
the @entity52 team now hope the project can be scaled up and fly on a real craft			2
" first we need a technology demonstrator in space in , say , five years , " said @entity67			2
" that 's quite realistic for a dedicated , small , unmanned spacecraft			0
" i 'm sure our idea will work			0
there are a number of improvements to make it work better though -- perhaps we should call down to @entity187			0

@entity12 's @entity190 mission to @entity6 revealed that astronauts on a round - trip would face high radiation levels
scientists at the @entity53 's @entity52 are working on a radiation shield for astronauts
a model has been tested inside a fusion reactor which produces a plasma like that of the solar wind
the team are hoping to test their concept in space in the next five years
