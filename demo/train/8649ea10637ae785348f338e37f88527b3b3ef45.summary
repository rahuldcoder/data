@entity0 , @entity1 -- professor @entity3 conducts a health check			1
he tenderly calls the patient over with a tap of his hand , checks tongue and teeth for injuries , eyes for mood , and skin for scratches			2
as a treat , he hands out a salted fish			2
" the most important thing we can do is to keep them healthy , " he says			0
@entity3 is one of a handful of @entity1 scientists trying to save the finless porpoise , a freshwater species found in the @entity24			1
rarer than @entity1 's giant panda , this famed species now teeters on the brink of extinction			1
recent surveys suggest that there are a mere thousand animals left , down dramatically from similar surveys conducted just six years ago			1
" if proper measures are n't taken they will be extinct in 10 years , but to be honest , we only have five years to take action , " said @entity33 of the @entity34			0
professor @entity3 and his colleagues research the rare mammal in a series of deep blue pools at the @entity44 in @entity0			0
they are trying to understand these curious creatures and possibly breed them for the wild			0
" i spend more time with them than with my family , " said @entity3 , " they have become an indispensable part of my life			0
" it 's mating season , so they dance underwater and act a little strange			2
occasionally , a porpoise swims right up to the viewing glass and all but presses its face against it			2
the porpoise 's face is set in a permanent quizzical smile			1
@entity65 and forward - facing eyes carefully monitor the movements of its visitors			0
porpoises are smaller and stouter than their dolphin cousins ; they have shorter beaks , and live in smaller groups			1
those groups could be getting even smaller in the wild			0
@entity75 's longest river is also one of its most polluted			2
scientists estimate that about 800 million tons of wastewater is dumped into the @entity24 every year			1
pollution , overfishing , and intensive development on the @entity24 have all combined to push the porpoise near extinction			1
" all of these human activities have destroyed the natural habitat of the finless porpoise , taking away their food supply and even injuring and killing them directly , " said @entity33			1
he said the prospect of survival in the @entity24 is bleak , but he clings onto hope for the species			1
that hope , such as there is , can be found @entity96 in @entity98 oxbow lake			0
once part of the @entity24 , the lake was formed from a bend in the river and then separated from the main stream			1
" this is the best chance we have to keep the species alive , " said @entity104 , an official in charge of the park			0
" we only have this animal in @entity1 and kids will start asking questions when they learn about it			1
they will ask ' why did it go extinct ? ' " it 's no idle fear			2
the @entity116 , a regal animal with its trademark pointed beak , went functionally extinct in the @entity24 in 2006			1
scientists believe there may be individual animals in the murky water , but it could never sustain the species			2
so the finless porpoise is the last remaining freshwater cetacean left in @entity1			1
@entity104 shows us a breeding pen separated from the lake by just a net			0
a handler drops individual fish into the mouth of the captive porpoises			0
they have to make sure to give exactly the right nutrients			0
they will be released into the lake , where the fewer than 40 porpoises could represent their last stand			0
" nobody cared about them in the past , but attitudes are changing			0
now , if they go extinct , all of our years of work will be meaningless , " said @entity104 .			0

researchers in @entity1 are working to *protect* the finless porpoise from extinction
they *'re* stouter than their dolphin cousins and rarer than @entity1 's giant panda
surveys show there are around one thousand of the animals left in @entity1 waters
pollution , overfishing , and intensive development on the @entity24 are being blamed
