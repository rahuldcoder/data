-- it 's bad enough that the recovery from the @entity3 has been slow and uneven			2
what 's much worse is that several key indicators were heading in the wrong direction well before it started			0
median income in the @entity9 has been stagnant or worse for at least 15 years , even as the big - ticket items of college , health care and housing have become more expensive			1
the middle class has for decades been getting " hollowed out " by job loss and wage decreases			0
social mobility -- the odds that children will do better than their parents -- is now lower in @entity9 than in most @entity22 countries , an uncomfortable truth for the land of opportunity			1
entrepreneurship is declining ( the amazing recent successes in the tech industry are the exception , not the rule ) , as is the percentage of gdp getting paid out in wages and benefits			1
this dour economic litany has helped give rise to movements of discontent like the tea party on the right and occupy on the left			1
it 's also led to a flood of proposed solutions ranging from a return to the gold standard to confiscatory taxes on high levels of income and wealth			0
we do n't think such radical fiscal or monetary measures are warranted			1
the main pilings of our economic system are not so rotten that they need to be replaced			1
what we need instead is to return to excellence at two of our historical strengths : coming up with important innovations and finding ways to include a great many people in our journey of progress			1
when it comes to technology , innovation is astonishingly robust these days			1
recent digital advances are truly the stuff of science fiction : fully autonomous cars and planes , artificial intelligence systems that can understand and produce human speech , robots for everything from painting cars to milking cows , printers that can make industrial - strength @entity79 objects and so on			1
technology is racing ahead so quickly , in fact , that it 's leaving a lot of our institutions , organizations , policies and practices behind			0
it 's in these latter areas where we must increase the pace of innovation			2
the solution is not to slow technology down but instead to speed up the invention of new jobs			0
that requires unleashing entrepreneurs ' creativity			0
it also requires a host of other conditions			0
are our regulations keeping up with new companies that let people summon a ride on the fly or rent out a room in their house ? are large employers able to look beyond the traditions of resume , transcript and interview when evaluating job candidates and learn how to value alternate signals like performance in a massive open online course ? will our primary education system decrease its current emphasis on rote learning and standardized testing and start teaching skills computers do n't have , such as creativity and problem - solving ? can we remove the kafkaesque barriers in place today that prevent so many of the world 's most talented , tenacious and ambitious people from immigrating to the @entity9 ? will the government start spending adequately in the areas where we know it pays off , like infrastructure and basic research ? too often today , the answers to questions like these are " no " or " not enough			1
" we 're quickly heading into what we call the second machine age : a time of transformation brought on digital technologies that will be as big a deal as the @entity142			0
to succeed in it , we 'll need to address the questions above and innovate widely and deeply , for two reasons			0
the first is to maximize this age 's benefits and bounty			0
the second , more important reason is to include as many people as possible in both producing its fruits and sharing them			2
the greatest flaw with our current path is the fact that a large group is being left out in every important sense			2
too many people are n't getting the skills and support they need in order to participate in a rapidly changing economy and do n't feel that they have any stake in a society that 's being created around them and without them			1
as a result , many are dropping out -- of education , of the work force , out of their communities and out of family life			0
whether or not the growing ranks of the unincluded and disaffected ever cause social unrest , they 're still a deep problem			2
@entity9 's history of assimilation and participation is far from perfect , but it 's still impressive			1
it has contributed to a thriving democracy and a large , stable and prosperous middle class , both of which have been the envy of the world			0
the evidence is mounting , however , that our great successes of inclusion are starting to reverse themselves			0
we need to harness our unmatched powers of innovation to make sure that this does not happen .			2

**authors** : economy is generating tech innovation , but too many people are left out
are immigration laws *welcoming* to innovators ? are employers *flexible* in hiring ?
will *schools* replace rote learning with the teaching of problem - solving skills ?
**authors** say @entity9 economic system is n't faulty but needs wider inclusiveness
