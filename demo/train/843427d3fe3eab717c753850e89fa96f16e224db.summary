-- on thursday , @entity1 goes to the polls to consider leaving the @entity3			1
i 'm praying they say no. for their sakes and for our sakes as fellow @entity3			1
do n't get me wrong : the @entity12 , the @entity1 , the @entity10 and the @entity11 are all very different people			1
you can tell it in the accents -- as an @entity12 , i find it almost impossible to do a passable @entity1 voice because i just ca n't sustain the requisite level of anger			1
and while the @entity12 are known for introversion and a terror of being noticed , the heat generated by the independence referendum has been a testament to the @entity1 ' uncompromising desire to say what they 're really thinking			1
you see those differences marked in the landscape			0
journeying from @entity30 to @entity31 to observe the campaign , i was struck by the sudden shift in geography as our train crossed the border			0
where @entity12 is small and crowded , @entity1 is huge and empty			1
@entity12 fields give way to massive @entity42 hills covered in green trees with bald patches of purple flowers			1
the valleys look like @entity47 smashed a fist into the soil -- wild , deep and jagged			0
that righteous @entity1 temper showing through again			1
but it 's precisely these differences that have made the @entity53 between our countries so remarkable -- and so important			0
for 300 years , we have sustained a political alliance between nations with distinct cultures that has produced one of the world 's most successful experiments in getting along against the odds			0
it 's a relationship of convenience , of course -- begun in part so that @entity1 could share in our imperial ambitions			1
and , as such , @entity1 's presence in the @entity53 has been sustained hitherto largely by good will			1
we may all have different understandings of our identity , but we share a common understanding of our needs			0
this began to change in the years after @entity75 as the empire vanished and industry declined , so the economic outlook of @entity1 and @entity12 began to diverge			1
a turning point was the election of @entity81 in 1979 -- a right - wing leader who may have helped raise living standards in @entity1 but whose faith in free markets became increasingly at odds with the @entity1 preference for a well - financed public sector			1
@entity1 could have rallied to the left - wing @entity89 , but @entity89 , too , moved drastically to the right and left many of its working - class constituents behind			1
the credit crunch challenged the idea that the @entity53 was impervious to economic shock and discredited our political leadership in @entity30			0
many @entity1 turned toward independence as an alternative way of ordering their affairs ( while many englishmen drifted toward the conservative @entity103 )			1
hence , much of the campaign for independence has centered not around nationalist themes , but socialist ones instead			0
its supporters imagine that if freed from the more right - wing @entity12 , they 'd be able to spend more and invest in public services			1
in fact , the opposite is true			0
such is the likely size of an independent @entity1 's debt , and so uncertain is the future of its currency , that it would almost certainly have to raise taxes through the roof			1
that brings us back to the benefits of sticking together			0
they are both material and emotional			0
on the material side , @entity3 may have been through a tough period recently , but it is now growing mightily			2
we are predicted to overtake the perfidious @entity126 in the size of our economy by 2020 -- making us the fifth biggest in the world			0
our accomplishments in the fields of constructing a welfare state or investing in high - tech sectors have been made possible by sharing resources and talent			0
likewise , in a frighteningly insecure world , we all benefit from a united defense			0
ok , so @entity3 's army no longer patrols an empire			1
but it is still one of the most powerful in the world , boasts a nuclear deterrent ( moored in @entity1 ) and is a lynchpin of the @entity146 alliance			2
the army is perhaps at the heart of the emotional case for the @entity53			0
standing together , we 've helped win two world wars and seen off the @entity152 invasion of the @entity153 in 1982			0
soldiers have fought in defense of their constituent countries , but always under the banner of the @entity3			2
the ties that bind us , then , are historical and poetic			0
every @entity159 , we @entity3 sing " @entity160 " -- written by the @entity1 poet @entity161			1
it 's a song about the importance of remembering old friendships : " and there 's a hand my trusty friend ! / and give me a hand o ' thine ! / and we 'll take a right good - will draught , / for auld lang syne			0
" it might seem silly to reduce a decision about the future of a nation to a few lines of a song sung drunkenly and off - key at midnight , but friendship is a precious thing that men will give their lives for			0
many , many @entity3 soldiers have done so in the past			2
i would save the @entity53 out of respect for their memory alone			0
to the @entity53 and the world , the @entity1 have brought poetry both sublime and hilariously bad			2
schoolchildren across the @entity3 still read the awful lines of @entity192 that serve as a primer for how not to write			2
@entity1 geniuses -- @entity195 , @entity196 , @entity197 , @entity198 , @entity199 , @entity200 , sir @entity201 , @entity202 , sir @entity203 -- have also given us all the invention of classical economics , a proud tradition of banking , color photography , the flushing toilet , golf , hypnotism , penicillin and the television set			2
the locals have also supplied @entity3 with its last hopeful myth : the rumored existence of the @entity218			2
it 's nonsense , of course , but a reminder -- again -- of how much mystery and wonder the @entity1 countryside brings to the @entity3			1
we are hoping to reintroduce wolves there			0
if @entity1 votes this week for independence , we will divorce with dignity ( excepting a few rows about debt and nuclear weapons )			2
but the @entity3 will miss her dearly			1
we will be reduced and forced to think afresh about who we are and what we stand for			0
if i 'm honest , the prospect of a @entity53 dominated too heavily by the @entity12 worries me			2
we 're simply not as loquacious or romantic as our @entity1 cousins .			1

historian @entity238 wants @entity1 to stay in the @entity3
he notes that the historical relationship changed after @entity75
@entity1 ' quest for a wider social *safety* net may be hard to achieve alone , he says
@entity238 says he 'd miss @entity12 's romantic , talkative partners if they go
