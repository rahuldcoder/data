-- @entity2 leaders are meeting in @entity3 thursday to discuss further sanctions against @entity5			1
so far the @entity6 has imposed financial and visa restrictions against 21 carefully selected @entity10 and @entity11 officials -- but avoided anyone from president @entity14 's inner circle and stayed clear of any large - scale economic sanctions			1
the @entity6 and @entity16 have condemned @entity10 annexation of @entity18 as illegal and stepped up their rhetoric towards the @entity20 , but whether they are willing to put more economic pressure on @entity5 is unclear			1
the leaders of @entity2 's biggest economies are likely to be cautious			2
how important is @entity5 's economy ? @entity5 is the eight biggest economy in the world , with gdp of more than $ 2 trillion			2
but its economy -- which is heavily reliant on commodities , particularly oil and gas , was growing just 1.3 % last year compared to 2012 , one of the sharpest slowdowns in the emerging markets			0
with the @entity11 crisis taking its toll , @entity5 's economy may not grow at all in 2014 , some analysts have warned			1
@entity5 would be one of the decade 's powerhouse economies may have faded , but its close links with the @entity6 have not			1
would sanctions hit @entity2 back ? the @entity6 is @entity5 's largest trading partner , and there are deep economic links between the two			1
almost half of @entity5 's exports -- $ 292 billion worth -- end up in @entity6 countries			1
15 % of @entity5 's gdp comes directly from the country 's exports to @entity6			1
@entity5 , in turn , is the third biggest trading partner for the @entity6 , with $ 169 billion in imports			1
but the eurozone itself has only just emerged from its own crisis , and is wary of cutting ties with such a powerful economic partner			0
its reliance on gas out of @entity5 would also feed caution			0
@entity62 , political science professor at @entity63 with expertise in security studies , says the sanctions would hurt both sides			2
" between great powers , leverage is a two - way street , @entity5 can squeeze us almost as effectively as we can squeeze them , " @entity62 wrote for @entity0			0
while steps that would push the price of oil down for a sustained period would really bite , these would be hitting right back			0
energy supplies remain vitally important for the @entity6 , to which @entity5 supplies a third of @entity6 's natural gas			1
@entity82 , the eurozone 's biggest economy , imports around 40 % of its gas from @entity5			0
what is @entity5 's economic relationship with the @entity16 ? the economic relationship between @entity5 and the @entity16 is more unbalanced			1
@entity5 is the 20th largest trading partner for the @entity16 , with $ 27 billion worth of trade exported across the @entity92			2
on the flip - side , the @entity16 is @entity5 's fifth largest partner , with just $ 11 billion worth of trade			2
according to @entity10 foundation chair @entity95 , trade is a " relatively unimportant " component of relations			0
energy links are also weakening as the @entity16 looks to shale gas for its energy supplies and heads towards self - sufficiency			2
@entity95 told @entity0 the @entity16 could get greater leverage over @entity5 from financial sanctions aimed at the country 's banking system and stability of the ruble			1
measures targeted at named individuals , similar to those contained in the @entity111 , could also be effective			0
" @entity5 's angry response to the act shows that it works , " @entity95 said			0
but again , the financial links between @entity5 and the west would mean huge losses for @entity2 banks which have lent billions to @entity10			1
while the @entity6 and @entity16 adopted sanctions against 28 individuals , @entity95 said these " have little more than nuisance value and would have to be dramatically expanded to have a real impact			1
" " travel bans and asset freezes aimed at all members of the @entity126 and @entity125 who voted to annex @entity18 would be a start , " @entity95 said			0
targeting the money men who handle the finances and assets ( often illicit ) of top tier politicians would really hurt , he added			0
and the names of these individuals are quite well known			0
but again , the financial links between @entity5 and the west would mean huge losses for @entity2 banks which have lent billions to @entity10			1
are there other options ? the @entity6 has a wide range of legal options here			0
its economic significance means sanctions can be very powerful tool			0
export and import bans or restrictions that apply to specific products such as oil or diamonds , flights restrictions or investment freezes have been successful in the past			0
" restricting access to foreign capital and the international banking system could prove very damaging indeed because @entity5 's economy is stagnating and it needs inward investment , " @entity95 said			0
but experience shows that economic sanctions rarely work in the pursuit of non-economic goals			2
" imposing economic sanctions on a state is similar to backing an angry dog into a corner -- in most cases , the dog will become more vicious , and more defensive , " @entity62 said			2
at the end , targeting @entity5 's national pride may prove more useful			0
" a decision by a large group of countries to boycott the 2018 @entity173 in @entity5 would probably hurt @entity10 prestige rather more , especially if @entity175 had to move the event to another country , " @entity95 said			1

tight economic links between @entity5 and the @entity6 could mean sanctions hurt both sides
