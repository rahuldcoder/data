editor 's note : @entity2 has served as the executive vice president and chief executive officer of the @entity5 since 1991			1
his latest book is " the @entity7 on your guns : inside the @entity9 to destroy the @entity10			0
" @entity2 says the @entity12 drug war is n't a reason to restrict gun ownership in the @entity15 ( @entity16 ) -- here 's a summary for the time - or attention - challenged : never surrender freedom for laws that ca n't affect criminals ; they disobey laws for a living			1
nobody is surprised that attorney general @entity24 wants to make good on his promise to ban guns			2
we just did n't know whose tragedy he 'd seize to advance his agenda			0
it 's the drug - driven death and violence in @entity12 at the hands of ruthless criminal cartels			1
barely a month on the job , @entity24 cited the @entity12 cartel killings as the excuse to resurrect the @entity40 gun ban			1
though a new face to some , @entity24 is a rabid @entity44 foe from the @entity40 administration who helped orchestrate the 1994 @entity40 gun ban			1
@entity15 has made this mistake already			2
so let 's learn the lies that led to their gun ban			1
even earthworms learn from experience ask any anti-gun politician to define an " assault weapon , " and the honest answer is , " i know one when i see one			0
" when cosmetics alone can infringe constitutional freedoms , we 're all in trouble			0
but that 's precisely how the 1994 gun ban came about			1
the gun - ban lobby and national media lied with lockstep conformity by playing endless footage of fully automatic machine gun fire			1
they fooled the @entity15 people and the @entity71 into thinking they were banning " high - powered , " " rapid - fire , " " battlefield - bred " guns designed to " spray fire from the hip			1
" none of that was true			0
then sen. @entity78 convened anti-gun bureaucrats to conduct a firearm beauty pageant			0
they browsed photos of hundreds of perfectly legal semiautomatic rifles			0
they picked 19 they deemed most military looking			0
but the guns are n't designed or used by the military			2
they 're commonly owned semiautomatic rifles that fire one shot when the trigger is pulled			0
they can not " spray fire , " nor are they designed to be fired " from the hip			0
" nor are they the choice of terrorists in @entity100 or drug gangs in @entity12			1
they prefer fully automatic machine guns , which our soldiers use			0
@entity71 was so doubtful about the ban 's effectiveness , they limited it to a 10 - year experiment			2
so it expired in 2004 , and for good reason			0
it was useless all along			0
as the study mandated by that @entity71 found , " the banned weapons and magazines were never used in more than a modest fraction of all gun murders " in the first place			0
the ban had absolutely no effect on gun crime			2
but what about @entity12 ? of course , everyone 's rooting for @entity12 president @entity125 's government to crush the drug cartels ' stranglehold			1
but our rights are not what 's wrong			0
nobody can substantiate claims that @entity15 guns cross the border " by the thousands " or " account for 95 % of weapons used by @entity12 drug gangs			1
" because it 's not true			0
replying to @entity78 in subcommittee hearings last week , @entity139 , assistant director of field operations at the @entity141 , said , " the investigations we have , that we see , for firearms flowing across the border do n't show us individuals taking thousands of guns a day or at a time flowing into @entity12			1
" yet reporter after politician after news anchor parrot the lie as readily as high schoolers gossip , and with equal disregard for truth			0
that 's how gun abolitionists claim @entity12 gun laws are so strict that our " weak laws " ( read : freedoms ) are to blame for " fueling the violence " in @entity12			1
well , to believe that : you have to believe these butchers and beheaders break every @entity12 law they want except @entity12 gun laws , which they honor -- while they break @entity15 gun laws			1
you have to believe that @entity12 's drug cartels , which possess the wealth and armies of nations , prefer @entity15 semiauto target and hunting rifles over fully automatic machine guns and any other military arms they want to crush opposition			1
you have to believe @entity12 drug lords -- who make @entity179 's list of billionaires -- do n't get large lots of weaponry on the transnational black market but instead choose to trifle with paperwork at @entity15 gun stores			1
you have to believe that narco - terrorists who buy fragmentation grenades , grenade launchers , explosives , body armor , biometric security equipment , infrared surveillance technology and intelligence - grade reconnaissance gear will salute and obey a new @entity15 gun law -- if only we 'd pass one			1
get real , get tough , but get away from our rights everything @entity12 's murderous thugs are doing is already illegal			2
at issue is not the absence of law , but the absence of political will to enforce the laws that both nations already possess			2
even @entity206 said , " we have the laws we need			0
we just need to more effectively enforce them			0
" those that make possible @entity12 's colossal corruption wear the garb of not only drug lords and gun runners , but also of too many city mayors and police chiefs , state bureaucrats and military officers			1
a $ 40 billion criminal enterprise could not exist without the complicity of these powerful co-conspirators			0
and these cartels are being abetted by @entity15 media and politicians who blame our freedoms for it			2
we should seal the border			2
and use existing gun and drug laws against violent drug syndicates here and in @entity12			1
but leave @entity15 freedoms alone			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			0

@entity2 : effort under way to *reinstate* @entity40 - era gun ban
he says claims that 95 % of @entity12 drug guns come from @entity15 are n't backed up
@entity2 : our gun freedoms are n't *responsible* for fueling the drug war
he says @entity15 should seal the border and enforce existing gun laws
