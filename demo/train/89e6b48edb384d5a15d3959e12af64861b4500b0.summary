@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 prime minister @entity3 and his @entity6 rival @entity5 both offered to form an alliance with the minority @entity8 friday as they jostled for power after an election that failed to create an outright winner			1
the center - right conservatives won more seats than @entity3 's @entity15 in thursday 's fiercely - contested vote but lacked the majority needed to form an effective government -- a rare outcome in @entity4 politics			1
@entity5 emphasized areas where his party and the @entity8 agreed , including education reform and scrapping plans for national @entity26 cards , while drawing red lines on defense and the economy			1
he was much vaguer on the @entity8 ' greatest ambition -- electoral reform -- that would probably give them more seats in parliament			1
@entity5 said : " the best thing for @entity4 now is a new government that works together in that national interest , " adding that the country needed " a strong , stable government that lasts			1
" @entity3 said friday he would be willing to negotiate with any party leader , but said that @entity5 and @entity44 leader @entity44 were " entitled to take as much time as they feel necessary " to forge a coalition			1
" should the discussions between mr. @entity5 and mr. @entity44 come to nothing then i would of course be prepared to discuss with mr. @entity44 the areas where there may be some measure of agreement between our two parties , " he said			1
what happens next ? aware of the uncertainty in the @entity4 financial markets about the outcome of the election and how any future government will tackle the country 's budget deficit , both @entity3 and @entity5 pledged to work in the " national interest			1
" @entity63 : is voting a duty ? @entity44 indicated he would be willing to talk first to the conservatives			1
" we 're in a fluid political situation , " he said			0
" it 's vital that all political parties , all political leaders act in the national interest and not out of narrow party political advantage			2
" full election coverage official returns friday showed it would be impossible for any one party to get a majority of seats			2
the conservative party came in first , with at least 306 seats in the 650 - seat parliament , followed by @entity3 's @entity15 with at least 258			1
the @entity8 came third , with at least 57			2
about two dozen seats went to smaller parties			0
one seat will not be decided until may 27 , after the election was delayed due to the death of a candidate			0
it 's very unusual for no party to get an absolute majority of seats in the @entity93			2
the last time it happened , in 1974 , voters were back at the polls within months			0
hung parliament casts shadow over markets several high - profile incumbents lost their seats overnight , including former home secretary @entity102 , of @entity15 ; and liberal democrat @entity103 , who had been in parliament for 13 years			1
all had been implicated in last year 's parliamentary expenses scandal			0
@entity107 first minister @entity106 , who has faced questions over land deals and a scandal involving his wife , also lost his seat			0
the loss of @entity106 , head of the @entity114 , robs the conservatives of a potential coalition supporter			0
the @entity116 , which favors environmental and social justice policies , gained its first member of parliament when @entity119 was elected in @entity120 , in southern @entity1			0
there were some scenes of voter anger across the country over long lines to cast ballots or polling stations running out of ballot papers , but it was not immediately clear how widespread problems were			0
anger at polling stations " we will be doing a serious and thorough review of this and making recommendations to parliament and the government , " @entity132 chairwoman @entity131 said			2
the @entity4 's system of voting is " @entity141 , antiquated , left over from an era when less people had to vote " and not designed to cope with mass participation , she said , adding that the system is now " at breaking point			2
" @entity8 leader @entity44 expressed his anger after hundreds of voters were turned away from a polling station in his @entity151 constituency			1
@entity44 said friday he was disappointed that an exuberant election campaign buoyed by his stellar performance in the country 's first - ever televised prime ministerial debates had failed to deliver hoped - for results			0
" many many people during the election campaign were excited about the prospect of doing something different , but it seems when they came to vote , many of them decided to stick with what they know , " he said			0
the @entity8 ' principal policy aim is reform to the electoral system which is currently weighted in favor of @entity15 and the @entity6			1
under the system , the candidate who receives the most votes in a constituency wins			0
the system , known as " first past the post , " is praised for its simplicity and the strong ties it forms between voters and representatives , but critics dislike its failure to provide proportional representation			0
