@entity0 -- a @entity3 grand jury has indicted @entity4 , who was arrested earlier this month in connection with the 1991 murder of 4 - year - old @entity7 , known for decades only as " @entity8			1
" @entity4 , 52 , did not appear in court for the procedural hearing on tuesday at his attorney 's request			1
" he 's holding up			2
he is resolute about seeing this through , " @entity13 said of his client			2
on october 12 , @entity0 police announced @entity4 's arrest , saying he confessed to the slaying during interrogation			1
according to @entity0 police commissioner @entity20 , @entity21 , who was 30 at the time of the crime , said he went to an apartment in @entity25 shared by seven of his relatives and saw @entity7 in the hallway			1
@entity4 told police he smothered her with a pillow while raping her			1
outside the court on tuesday , @entity4 's attorney cast doubt on the confession , which he said took place after 12 to 14 hours of questioning			1
" i do n't trust any statements that were made by any individual after being in custody for such an extended period of time , " @entity13 said			2
" i would expect that we will find out that statement was not videotaped or recorded , and that is by design			0
" in 1991 , construction workers found the body of @entity7 , who had not been reported missing , bound and in a garbage bag , hidden under some soda cans inside a blue and white cooler			1
she had been smothered and sexually molested , and her body was so decomposed that several sketches were made to suggest what she looked like			0
the young victim became an emotional symbol for the @entity56			0
two years after she was found , the girl was laid to rest in a donated plot , buried in a white dress bought by a detective 's wife , with a tombstone paid for by detectives			1
" because we care " was the inscription at the bottom of the tombstone			0
each year , on the anniversary of the july 23 , 1991 , discovery of her body , police would canvass nearby neighborhoods , handing out fliers and asking people for information			1
it was an anonymous tip called in after the latest canvass in july that helped crack the case , @entity20 said			0
the tip led detectives to @entity7 's sister , now an adult ; from there , they identified the woman believed to be the girl 's mother			1
changes in forensic science also helped propel the investigation , @entity20 said			0
the girl 's body was exhumed in 2006 , and a dna profile was built in 2011			0
earlier this month the office of the chief medical examiner made a dna match between the girl and her mother			0
from there , investigators constructed a family tree , and the trail led them to @entity21 , @entity20 said			0
on tuesday , @entity4 's attorney said he had not seen any of the evidence against his client			2
" i would be interested in seeing that physical evidence , " @entity13 said			0
he also suggested that it was inappropriate for a @entity106 journalist to have interviewed @entity4 in prison at @entity108			2
in the interview published last week , @entity4 reportedly denied killing @entity7 , saying he was forced by detectives to make a false confession			1
@entity112 is expected to appear in court on november 21			0
