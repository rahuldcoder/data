" there is no question that the media attention , public outrage and efforts of the @entity57 were critical in preventing conviction of a @entity11 citizen for exercising a clearly protected human right to freedom of speech and thought , " she said in a statement			2
@entity9 's wife , @entity63 , said @entity9 had gone to @entity26 planning to visit his younger sister and talk about democracy and the rule of law			1

" the government detained him because he was opposed to them , " said @entity87			0
