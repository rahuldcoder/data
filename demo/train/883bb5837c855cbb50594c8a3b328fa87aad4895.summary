@entity1 's leader accused @entity2 of " genocide " last century during the war in @entity5 , a ratcheting up of rhetoric over controversial @entity2 legislation that would criminalize any public denial of what the bill calls the @entity13 genocide last century in @entity1			1
" in @entity5 , an estimated 15 percent of the population had been subjected to the massacre of @entity2 from 1945 on			1
this is genocide , " prime minister @entity16 said during a conference in @entity18 on friday			1
" @entity5 were burnt en masse in ovens			1
if @entity2 president mr. ( @entity24 ) @entity23 does not know about this genocide , he should ask his father @entity23			2
his father @entity23 served as a soldier in the @entity2 legion in @entity5 in 1940s			1
" once a @entity2 colony , guerrillas in the @entity31 nation fought a bloody war against @entity2 rule from 1954 to 1962			2
the @entity35 shot back , saying " we deplore excessive use of formulas and personal attacks that do not meet up to the standards of our mutual interest and of our relations			1
@entity2 recalls that it assumes with clarity and transparency its duty to remember the tragedies that have marked its history			2
" at the same time , it cited foreign minister @entity51 's call for " measure and restraint , " which , he said , " are more than ever necessary under the current circumstances			0
" @entity1 is angered over the bill , passed by the @entity56 on thursday and now under review by the @entity2 @entity58			1
immediately after the vote , @entity16 announced that @entity1 is reviewing its ties with @entity2			1
he said @entity1 is recalling its @entity62 ambassador to @entity63 for consultations , is canceling bilateral visits , and wo n't cooperate with @entity2 in joint projects within the @entity67			1
it is also halting " political consultations " with @entity2 , stopping bilateral military activities and joint exercises , and canceling permission granted annually for all military overflights , landings and take - offs			2
@entity16 hopes the @entity58 fails to pass the so - called armenian genocide bill but he warns that if it does , @entity1 will initiate more measures toward @entity2			1
the @entity79 - @entity13 controversy over the massacres of last century has reverberated wherever diaspora communities representing both groups exist			0
@entity13 groups and many scholars argue that starting in 1915 , @entity79 committed genocide , when more than a million ethnic @entity86 were massacred in the waning days of the @entity1			2
the @entity13 has hailed the @entity2 move			2
but modern - day @entity1 officially denies that a genocide took place , arguing instead that hundreds of thousands of @entity13 @entity90 and @entity91 @entity79 died in intercommunal violence around the bloody battlefields of @entity94 @entity23 , speaking on tv from the @entity97 capital of @entity98 , explained that his country does n't need an ok from another nation to develop its policies			0
he was attending the funeral of late @entity97 leader @entity104			0
" in every circumstance we must remain cool headed and calm			0
@entity2 alone determines its politics			0
@entity2 does not ask for authorization			0
@entity2 has convictions : human rights , the respect for history			0
every country must make the effort to revisit its past			0
@entity2 does not give lessons to anyone nor does it receive lessons from anyone , " @entity23 said			0
saying that five million @entity121 in live in @entity2 , @entity16 noted the " dangerous dimensions that racism , discrimination and animosity against @entity121 reached in @entity2 and @entity127			1
@entity2 president @entity23 got the ambition to win the elections with animosity against @entity79 and @entity121 and unfortunately he does n't refrain from playing such dangerous games			0
" @entity1 and @entity2 are @entity137 allies , and , according to official @entity79 statistics , the volume of trade between @entity1 and @entity2 from january to the end of october this year was more than $ 13.5 billion			1
the genocide debate is an annual source of tension between @entity1 and the @entity142 , also two @entity137 allies			0
