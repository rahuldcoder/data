-- @entity2 football icon @entity1 has told @entity0 his record during a playing career spanning 25 years is unrivalled by anyone else in the sport			1
the former @entity8 striker was part of three @entity12 winning @entity11 squads and was named @entity14 player of the century in 2000			1
the 70 - year - old , whose full name is @entity18 do @entity15 , said modern players do not achieve success over a prolonged period like their illustrious predecessors			1
" nobody did what @entity1 did , " the one - time @entity23 forward told @entity0			1
" being champion of the world at 17 - years - old , won three @entity28 , scored more than 1,208 goals , only him			1
" then until now nobody did this , to me , @entity1 is the best			1
you can mention players that played for 10 years , for example [ @entity39 ] @entity38 , [ @entity41 ] @entity40 , [ @entity43 ] @entity42 , @entity44 , @entity45 , then come [ @entity46 ] @entity47 , @entity48			2
" those players used to play a long time			2
now the players they play one year , two years , then disappear			2
" his final @entity12 was in 1970 and @entity1 rates the @entity11 team that lifted the @entity55 trophy in @entity56 as the finest the @entity58 country has ever produced			1
" in 1958 , 1962 , @entity11 had excellent individuals			0
we had @entity61 , we had @entity62 , @entity63			0
also @entity1 , [ @entity65 ] @entity64 were excellent players			1
but as a team all together i think 1970 was no doubt the best team			0
" @entity11 will host the tournament they have won a record five times in 2014 , and their former number 10 said the nation will be ready for one of sport 's biggest competitions , but @entity1 warned the speed of preparations must be increased			1
" of course they [ the stadiums ] will be ready			2
the state of @entity85 ... we do n't decide yet , we do n't start [ building ] the stadium yet			0
this i think is a little bad for the reputation of @entity11 , for the reputation of those who work for @entity11			0
" after 18 years with @entity63 , @entity1 made the decision to sign with the @entity23 in the now defunct @entity96 ( @entity96 ) in 1975			1
a project to bring back the @entity23 -- which includes former @entity98 striker @entity42 as the team 's director of football -- has been launched and @entity1 is acting as a representative for his former club			1
" when i retired , at that time i had a lot of proposals to play in @entity105 , @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity108 , @entity56			0
but i said no , after 18 years i want to rest , because i want to retire			0
" they wanted to make soccer big in the @entity111			0
that was the reason i come back to play			0
then i start my mission			0
now i am here because of this			0
" we are going to revive @entity23 , to be fantastic			0
because [ when when i started ] with @entity23 [ football ] became a very big sport in the @entity111 , and now we come back			2

@entity1 has told @entity0 no one can match his achievements in football
the @entity2 won three @entity28 , more than any other player
the 70 - year - old is *confident* his *homeland* will be ready to host the @entity128
