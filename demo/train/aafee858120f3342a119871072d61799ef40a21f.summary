-- there 's no question that @entity3 is supremely talented			1
the real question is whether the best home for those talents is on her own variety show			2
the " @entity10 " alum tested that theory on monday night with the hour - long @entity13 special " the @entity12			1
" critics were n't bowled over , but the ratings were nothing to sneeze at with 7.2 million tuning in			1
( it probably did n't hurt that " @entity22 " premiered after " @entity18 , " which had 11.5 million watching the first part of its season finale			0
) the concept for " the @entity12 " is a callback to the variety specials of yore , with ' 70s programs like " the @entity28 " and " @entity29 " serving as inspiration			2
monday 's hour included song , dance , sketches and plenty of " @entity10 " cameos , but unlike @entity39 's former gig , the variety show was n't live , late night tv			1
" i always really responded to the familial aspect of it and how much fun they were having , which is what i miss more than anything about ' snl ' -- my friends and laughing , " @entity39 previously told @entity41			0
according to critics , @entity39 's special was n't too short on laughs -- but it did lack cohesiveness and timeliness			1
" to be honest , it was a bit of a mess -- albeit a wildly entertaining one , " said @entity59 's @entity58			2
" it was a sometimes too - corny , sometimes too - raunchy , scattershot hour that was as gut - bustingly hilarious as it was completely baffling			0
" so while " it 's certainly admirable that @entity13 is attempting to bring the variety show back -- and they 've made a genius decision in entrusting @entity39 to lead the way -- the question is whether anyone will follow , or even if they 'd want to			1
" with audiences accustomed to watching entire networks devoted to precisely what they 're in the mood for -- music , comedy or otherwise -- the variety show necessitates the sort of patience the average tv viewer may not have , argues @entity82 's @entity81			1
and with critics divided on whether @entity39 was magnetic enough to hold viewers ' attention for an hour , it 's unclear if she can single - handedly revive the retro format			0
( @entity81 , for one , thinks @entity89 or @entity90 would be able to do it better			0
) @entity93 's tv critic @entity92 agreed that " the @entity12 " was " pleasant without being particularly funny or memorable , odd without being urgent or edgy , scattershot without taking any big swings			0
" " on the strength of last night 's pleasant , listless example , maybe ( the variety show ) needs reviving even less than pop - up video			1
" @entity100 's @entity99 , too , was n't quite sold that " variety is a format that makes sense on @entity104 tv in 2014 , " but she did think the first airing of " the @entity12 " had its strengths			2
" i hope this is n't the series ' only outing because i have almost infinite positive regard for @entity39 , and i 'd rather see a show like this find itself than watch another second of some hate - soaked but competent sitcom , " @entity114 reviewed			0
" but i kept wondering what the mission of ' @entity117 ' is , what tone it aspires to , how it sees itself , how it 's supposed to feel			0
... mostly , though , the show just needs to be more			0
