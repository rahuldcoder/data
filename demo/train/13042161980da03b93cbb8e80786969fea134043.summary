it 's a major @entity2 waterway that rivals the @entity3 , the @entity4 and the @entity5			2
now , deadly fighting in @entity7 has transformed the @entity8 into something much more than a river			1
it has become a cultural symbol of a deeply divided nation			0
along its winding path — and elsewhere — @entity16 photojournalist @entity15 met people whose lives have been profoundly changed since fighting erupted last year between @entity7 government forces and @entity22 rebels			1
despite a shaky ceasefire , which was reached last september , sporadic fighting continues			0
" i 'm trying to show the amazing unbroken spirit of people which are united and determined to fight for what they believe , " @entity15 told @entity1 on the phone this week			1
her camera captured fascinating people linked to the conflict : a masked fighter brandishing a piece of wood shaped like a rifle , children wearing paramilitary uniforms standing at attention , a young couple dramatically embracing in the midst of an intense protest			0
@entity15 also photographed landscapes reflecting the mood of the region : a cable car suspended over the mighty @entity8 , giant concrete wave - breakers blocking a road , and a protest billboard depicting @entity50 president @entity49 wearing a @entity52 - style mustache			1
the @entity8 basically slices @entity7 into two parts — east and west — as it flows roughly north to south connecting the capital , @entity55 , to the @entity56			1
the farther east of the river you go , residents tend to lean toward @entity22 rebels			2
the farther west of the river , people are more likely to support the government			2
" i 'm trying to keep a wider perspective , " @entity15 said , mindful that although the fighting has been limited to relatively small regions , it has very much affected people nationwide			1
before the ceasefire , an august report from the @entity71 said at least 2,220 people had been killed since mid-april 2014			0
at least 5,956 had been wounded , the report said , not including the 298 victims of @entity75 17 , which was shot down over the region in july			0
@entity50 annexed @entity7 's semi-autonomous region of @entity78 in march , supported by @entity78 's ethnic @entity50 majority			1
@entity49 said @entity50 was protecting @entity78			0
but international opponents called it a land grab and slapped @entity50 with economic sanctions			0
photographing people in war - torn countries was n't what @entity15 had in mind when she first envisioned her career			1
she said she started as a " very socially engaged person in general " who aspired to become a painter			0
" in a sense , photography can combine those two things , " she said			0
" you can be a socially engaged artist — being a photographer			2
what interests me in photography is it can be a tool to be able to talk to people — to discover their stories — to tell their stories			0
" she trained to become a film critic , she said			0
but eventually @entity15 knew she wanted to watch dramatic events unfold in real life , instead of on the silver screen			1
her @entity7 photos won @entity15 a grant from the @entity113 - based @entity112 , which encourages photographers to tell stories about the aftermath of conflict			1
she hopes she 'll be able to return to @entity7 this year , to reunite with the people she met and see how their lives have changed			1
the ceasefire , @entity15 said , does n't seem to be working well			1
and the fighting ? " it does n't look like there 's an end to it			0
" nonetheless , she said she 's discovered firsthand something that @entity7 seem to share			2
" the strength of @entity7 is really amazing — the determination , " she said			2
" not just talking about the war , i think they 're a very strong people			0
" @entity15 is a photographer based in @entity131 , @entity132			1
you can follow her on @entity134 .			0
