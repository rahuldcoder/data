@entity0 , @entity1 -- prosecutors in @entity4 , @entity1 , on wednesday sought to convince jurors that a young woman accused of stabbing to death an 18 - year - old woman last year did not act in self - defense but intended to attack her because both women were fighting over the same man			1
@entity13 , 20 , is accused of killing @entity14 in the early hours of april 15 , 2009			1
according to court records , the two women were involved with @entity17 , then 20 , and over a period of several months engaged in a series of nasty confrontations over him via @entity23 postings , text messages and voicemails			0
the situation escalated when the two women confronted one another outside a friend 's home			0
@entity30 stabbed @entity14 , who was unarmed , twice in the chest , and @entity14 died at the scene			1
the defense is arguing that @entity30 , at 5 - foot - 4 and 110 pounds , acted in self - defense -- fearing for her safety when she was confronted by @entity14 , 5 - foot - 9 and 166 pounds , and two other women			1
but in the opening day of the trial wednesday , the prosecution sought to portray @entity30 as the initial aggressor , who waited for @entity14 with a knife and barely gave her time to get out of her vehicle before attacking her			2
four witnesses to the night of the confrontation testified before the six - person jury wednesday : @entity49 , the sister of @entity17 and a friend of @entity14 's ; @entity51 , a friend of @entity49 's ; @entity52 , @entity14 's best friend ; and @entity54 , a friend of @entity30 's ex-boyfriend			1
@entity51 and @entity49 both testified that while they were driving to a @entity59 's with @entity14 in her minivan , they heard their friend on the phone with @entity30 and said they heard @entity30 tell her , " i 'm going to stab you and your @entity66 boyfriend			2
" @entity14 grew upset , according to the testimony , and learned of @entity30 's whereabouts when she happened to pass @entity52 on the road on their way to @entity59 's			2
@entity52 told the women that she had seen wade at her ex-boyfriend @entity76 's house , according to @entity17			0
@entity14 then rushed over to @entity76 's house , where @entity30 was at her car with a knife nearby , @entity49 and @entity51 testified			2
@entity14 pulled her minivan to an abrupt halt , its nose about 5 feet from the front of @entity30 's @entity83 , and began to get out of the vehicle , according to testimony			2
within a matter of seconds , prosecutors say , @entity30 grabbed the knife and approached the driver 's side of the minivan and attacked @entity14 between the driver 's open door and the minivan			1
however , @entity54 , the final witness of the day and who was standing outside @entity76 's house when the stabbing occurred , testified that the three women jumped out of the minivan at the same time and approached @entity30			0
he said the attack occurred between the two cars			0
his testimony , given via videotape from his military posting overseas , could be key to the defense as it seeks to build its case around self - defense			1
prosecutors played the 911 call placed on the night of the incident by @entity51 , who can be heard screaming that " @entity13 just ... stabbed her			0
" both @entity51 and @entity30 wiped away tears as the audio recording was played			0
prosecutors are expected thursday to play other recordings of threatening voicemail messages left on @entity14 's cell phone by @entity30 in the eight months before the attack			1
in an august 29 , 2008 , voicemail , @entity30 can be heard saying " i 'm guaranteeing you i 'm going to ... murder you , " according to testimony at a prior hearing in the case			0
the jury will also hear from police officers who responded to the incident , as well as the medical examiner			0
@entity30 , who was 19 at the time of the killing , faces life in prison -- a minimum of 20 and a half years -- if convicted of second - degree murder in the case			1
in @entity136 's @entity135 contributed to this report .			0
