-- fifty years ago , we stood at a moral crossroads as a nation			1
the day was june 11 , 1963			0
that morning , then - gov. @entity4 attempted to block integration of the @entity6 with his futile " stand at the schoolhouse door			0
" hours later , civil rights leader @entity8 would be gunned down in the driveway of his home by a white supremacist			2
in between , my uncle , president @entity12 , took to the airwaves in a historic televised address on civil rights -- one that would forever change the way our nation perceived the struggle for racial equality			1
" we are confronted primarily with a moral issue , " president @entity12 said that night , hours before @entity8 was killed			1
" it is as old as the @entity27 and is as clear as the @entity28			0
the heart of the question is whether all @entity31 are to be afforded equal rights and equal opportunities			0
" you can listen to his speech here			0
it was a seminal moment in our history			0
president @entity12 defined for the nation the struggle for equality not just as a constitutional or legal issue , but as a moral one as well			1
five decades later , we 're again at a crossroads as a country			0
as we mark the 50th anniversary of president @entity12 's famous speech , the question he asked the @entity31 people that evening from the @entity51 remains strikingly relevant -- should n't all @entity31 be afforded equal rights and equal opportunities ? sadly , when it comes to the treatment of people with mental illness , addiction and brain injury , equality remains unattained			1
in @entity31 in 2013 , thousands of our fellow citizens are still marginalized			0
they are still discriminated against			0
they face stigma every day			2
today , too many @entity31 are told that they 're less entitled to health care than those who have diseases like diabetes or cancer or asthma , just because the origin of their illness is in their brain			1
without equality , or parity , insurers can refuse to cover mental illnesses at the same level as other physical illnesses , making it harder for people to get well and often further isolating them in their struggle			2
together , we must change that			0
eliminating the stigma of mental illness -- and finally achieving parity for its treatment -- is the next chapter in @entity31 's civil rights movement			1
when i represented @entity90 in @entity91 , i fought for the rights of people with mental illness , and was proud to sponsor -- along with my father , sen. @entity94 -- the @entity95 and @entity96 to provide access to mental health treatment for tens of millions of @entity31 who previously were denied care			1
signed into law by president @entity102 in 2008 , this landmark legislation requires health insurers that offer coverage for mental illness and substance use disorders to provide those benefits in a no more restrictive way than all other medical and surgical procedures covered by the plan			1
this was a proud moment for me , but those with mental illnesses are still waiting for some pieces of this law to be implemented			0
for those with mental illness , this october marks another landmark 50th anniversary -- president @entity12 's signing into law of the historic @entity121			1
this legislation , and the words he used to describe it , laid the foundation for contemporary mental health policy			2
these historic dates are important to remember , but as we look back , we are reminded not just of inspiration and achievement , but also where we have fallen short			0
because while president @entity12 set us on the right course , the words he used to describe the insufficient attention and resources devoted to mental health in 1963 could still be said today : " this situation has been tolerated far too long			1
it has troubled our national conscience -- but only as a problem unpleasant to mention , easy to postpone , and despairing of solution			0
" he then said , " the time has come for a bold new approach			0
" this october , as we mark this important occasion , i am proud to launch the inaugural " the @entity147 , " an annual event that will serve as a vehicle to honor president @entity12 's efforts , celebrate the progress made in the past half - century , and rededicate the entire mental health community to further progress			1
we have to eradicate the stigma of mental illness once and for all , and treat mental illness equal to other physical illnesses , so that all @entity31 can lead dignified lives and share in the benefits of our society			1
we are confronted with a moral issue but also a historic opportunity			2
we have the chance to take action and live up to the principle upon which @entity31 was founded : that all people are afforded equal rights and equal opportunities			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity172 .			2

50 years ago , president @entity12 defined civil rights and equality as a moral issue
@entity172 : it 's also a moral issue that people with mental illness are treated equally
those with mental illness , brain injuries face stigma and inadequate health care , he says
@entity12 : @entity12 *championed* helping the mentally ill , it 's time to *re-dedicate* our efforts
