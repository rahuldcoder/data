-- it is well know that leaders at the highest echelons of politics and business tend to be taller -- an advantage called the " height premium			1
" now , research shows a similar correlation with voice pitch : the lower a ceo 's voice , the larger his company and paychecks tend to be			1
the new study , led by professors at @entity19 's @entity18 and the @entity20 , looked at the voice pitches of nearly 800 male ceos speaking in public in the @entity24 past research already showed that in a laboratory , where researchers played voices that had been artificially manipulated to various pitches , people preferred the lower ones as leaders			1
so this latest report took the study to the next step , seeing if the experiments translated to the success level of real @entity22			1
" it appears that the labor market is matching deeper - voiced individuals with larger firms , which means this is influencing boards of directors ' judgments , perhaps , " said @entity39 , associate professor at @entity40 , who headed the study			1
but @entity39 says researchers still need to figure out why this matching is happening for it to have meaningful applications			0
" what we do n't know yet is where the benefit comes from			0
does it come from cutting through red tape in a big corporation a bit faster if you 're more authoritative or dominant vocally ? " he said			0

while research like this may imply that aspiring leaders who are short and have a high voice pitch are genetically disadvantaged , @entity39 says this view places too much weight on a few physical traits			1
" it takes a lot of different features that come together in order to make a person who he or she is , and i think it 'd be premature to suggest that if you had a high - pitched voice or if you were short that you just have no shot of ascending to leadership ranks			2
there 's much more to it , " he says			0
while @entity39 acknowledges there are ways for @entity22 to change how to speak , such as through presentation training , he is skeptical about the usefulness of speaking in an unnatural way or dressing a certain way to make up for physical disadvantages			2
if executives all take the same measures , he says , then one 's position relative to other @entity22 does not change			1
" there are certain bounds that we 're just born with , " he says			0

using words with two , three or four syllables gives the perception of a high education , she says			0
using fewer words , and omitting complaints or explanations are other ways to convey power			1
" women tend to give their power away when they ' chat , ' go on and on endlessly , " @entity120 says			2
@entity120 says to look successful in the workplace , executives should dress in one color , which adds height , and wear plain fabric rather than patterned styles			2
women should maintain a consistent business look and avoid open - toe sandals , bare legs and dangling or sparkling jewelry in the workplace			0
" trust is higher when an elegant , sophisticated business look is consistently presented , " she says			0

" @entity120 also advises against dressing down on the weekends or when traveling			0
not only does professional attire lead to more upgrades and perks at restaurants , on flights and in hotels , but there is always a chance of striking up business relationships during this downtime , like when seated on a plane			0
as for how executives , especially men , should carry themselves : " no hands in your pockets ever , " she says .			0
