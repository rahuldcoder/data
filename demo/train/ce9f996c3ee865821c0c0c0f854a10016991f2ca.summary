-- @entity4 gov. @entity3 has removed a fourth member of a state commission charged with investigating claims that an innocent man may have been executed , his office said			1
a family photo shows @entity10 with his wife , @entity11 , and daughters @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15			0
the @entity4 governor has now replaced all of the four members that , under law , he is allowed to appoint to the commission			1
the remaining five members are appointed by the state 's lieutenant governor and attorney general			1
@entity3 's critics say his actions are politically motivated , a charge he denies			1
the investigation into claims that faulty evidence led @entity4 to execute an innocent man in 2004 was at a " crucial point " when the shakeup occurred , one of the replaced members said			1
the commission was to hear from the author of a scathing report in the case of the executed man , @entity10 , when @entity3 announced on september 30 that he would replace three members			1
the session was postponed indefinitely because of the new appointments , and @entity3 's critics accused him of trying to quash the @entity10 probe			1
" i think people are making a lot of this issue , " @entity3 said earlier			0
commissioner @entity49 was replaced by @entity50 , a district attorney who was also named commission chairman			2
@entity52 was replaced by @entity53 , chief forensic pathologist for @entity55 and @entity10 counties			2
@entity3 said at the time the replacements were " pretty normal protocol			2
" in a statement thursday , @entity3 's office said he had appointed attorney @entity60 of @entity61 to replace former commission chairman @entity62 of @entity63 , and that @entity64 of @entity65 , chief medical examiner for @entity66 , would replace commissioner @entity67			1
" if you 've got a whole new investigation going forward , it makes a lot more sense to put the new people in now and let them start the full process , rather than bring people in there for a short period of time and then replace them , " @entity3 said two weeks ago			1
" i think it makes a whole lot more sense to make a change now than to make a change later			0
" but the @entity84 began investigating the @entity10 case in 2008 , hiring @entity87 fire investigation expert @entity86 to examine the evidence used to convince a jury the fire that killed @entity10 's three daughters was deliberately set			1
@entity49 said at the time of his replacement he had told @entity3 's office " that it would be disruptive to make the new appointments right now			1
" " the commission was at a crucial point in the investigation , " he told @entity0			1
asked about the future of the @entity10 investigation , he said , " i do n't know if it will ever be heard			0
" both @entity49 and @entity62 said they had asked to remain on the board			0
@entity60 declined to give an opinion on the @entity10 controversy when contacted by the @entity105 for a story friday , saying all he knows on the matter is what he 's read in the newspaper			2
" because i have n't had involvement with the commission , i ca n't really comment on what 's been going on in the commission in the past , " he said			2
" i will work very hard to make sure the duties of the commission ... as given by the @entity116 are carried out			0
" @entity86 's report -- the first commissioned by a state agency -- is the latest of three to conclude that arson was not the likely cause of the 1991 fire			1
death - penalty opponents say an impartial review of @entity10 case could lead to an unprecedented admission -- that the state executed an innocent man			1
the @entity86 report concluded that the ruling of arson at the heart of @entity10 's conviction " could not be sustained " by modern science or the standards of the time			1
@entity3 , who faces a @entity137 primary challenge in his bid for a third term next year , refused to issue a last - minute stay of execution for @entity10 in 2004 and has said he remains confident that @entity10 was guilty			0
so have authorities in @entity143 , south of @entity144 , who prosecuted @entity10 in his daughters ' deaths			0
asked earlier whether the governor wants to see the @entity10 investigation go forward , @entity3 spokeswoman @entity148 told @entity0 , " that 's a decision of the commission			1
" however , the first replacements raised concern among @entity10 's relatives , who worked to avert his execution and to clear his name after his death			2
" it sounds like someone made governor @entity3 mad , " his stepmother , @entity159 , said after hearing the news during an interview with @entity0 at her home in @entity163 , @entity164			2
" i think it 's going to delay things , " she added			2
" it makes me wonder why			0
" neither @entity62 nor @entity49 would say whether they believed political considerations were behind their replacement , though @entity62 said in a written statement that the investigation should not be dropped " because there might be political ramifications			0
" @entity50 told @entity0 at the time of his appointment he did not believe it was meant to stall the @entity10 probe			0
" people tend to read into these things the kind of preconceived notions they come to these issues with , " @entity50 said			0
" they 're not going to change those positions overnight			0
they 're going to watch how the commission does its work			0
" he said if he does his job right , the commission will " probably satisfy most of those people			0
" @entity0 's @entity193 contributed to this report .			0
