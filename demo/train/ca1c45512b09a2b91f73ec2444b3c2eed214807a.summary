-- @entity1 says she can still remember the day her daughter was taken			2
what began as a simple walk home from a shopping trip more than five years ago became a nightmare , she says			2
" november 3 , 2006 , is when they stole my daughter , " she told @entity0 thursday			2
" i had left to go shopping			2
when i came back , i did not realize that a woman was following me			2
when i entered my house , my daughter stayed on the patio , and that was when she was taken			0
" but that account is not what she has told other news organizations in describing what happened that day			0
in 2008 , she told @entity18 a woman appeared in her backyard and grabbed her out of her arms , while she was trying to enter her house			0
last year , the @entity23 reported that @entity1 felt someone tug at her daughter as she tried to enter her home , and then turned to see a woman get into a waiting taxi , along with her young daughter			1
and the @entity31 newspaper reported that @entity1 said she left her daughter on the patio with other children while she went to deal with clothes on the terrace			0
reached friday by phone , @entity1 told @entity0 she does not remember telling @entity18 or anyone that the girl was snatched from her arms			1
she said she 's given multiple interviews on the case , and stood by what she said earlier -- that she left the girl outside after returning from a shopping trip			1
it all happened in about two minutes , @entity1 said			0
now , the 7 - year - old girl is at the center of an international custody dispute			1
she is a child with two identities , in two countries , with two sets of parents who claim her as their own			1
in @entity53 , they call her @entity54			0
in @entity55 , she is known as @entity56			0
@entity55 authorities say @entity58 was snatched from @entity1 and sold to an international adoption agency			1
last year , a @entity55 judge ruled that the girl belonged with @entity1 and not with her adoptive @entity63 parents			1
the @entity55 government suspended adoptions in 2007 after authorities found multiple cases of falsified birth certificates and paperwork , as well as alleged thefts of babies			0
this week , the @entity71 weighed in on the case of the 7 - year - old girl , saying a @entity63 state court would have to decide whether the girl should return to @entity55 , because when the incident happened , the two countries had not yet signed an international treaty dealing with abducted children			1
" our view remains that , at the time , this appeared to be a legitimate adoption			0
so again , our preferred course of action would be for any claims to be pursued in the state courts of the @entity63 , " @entity71 spokeswoman @entity81 said			1
@entity1 told @entity0 she was devastated by the news			0
" i feel very sad , and i am still suffering , because i had hope that the @entity63 would respond to me and would return my daughter			1
... i do not know why they are unfair , because i have my rights , because i am her real mother , " she said			1
in @entity55 at least 10 people have been charged with human trafficking in connection with the case of this adoptive girl			1
so far , two of those people have been convicted , and the others are awaiting trial			0
that 's more than enough proof , @entity1 says , that her daughter should come home			0
" there is very important evidence , which revealed that she was stolen from me , and dna evidence proves that i am her real mother , " she told @entity0			2
however , a source with knowledge of the case told @entity0 that while @entity1 's @entity108 matches the dna of a child brought to the embassy in @entity55 , there is no evidence the child in question in the @entity63 is the same child tested at the embassy			1
also , questions have been raised about whether the person presenting the child at the embassy was , in fact , @entity1 's sister , which casts doubt on the kidnapping story , the source said			2
@entity55 authorities say the adoption agency falsified documents to make the girl eligible for adoption , something that the adoptive parents in @entity53 apparently did n't know			2
@entity1 says she now hopes to go to court in @entity53 to get her daughter back			0
the adoptive parents were unavailable for comment , referring @entity0 to their lawyer in @entity138 , who declined to comment			0
last year a family representative said the adoptive parents would " continue to advocate for the safety and best interests of their legally adopted child			1
they remain committed to protecting their daughter from additional traumas as they pursue the truth of her past through appropriate legal channels			0

the mother has given various accounts of how the child *disappeared*
the 7 - year - old girl is at the center of an international custody dispute
the @entity71 says the case should be settled in @entity63 state courts
