@entity0 -- the @entity2 is recalling more than 16,000 sets of body armor even though the secretary of the @entity2 disagrees with a @entity7 report that some of the ceramic plates failed testing and might not offer the protection required for troops on the battlefield			1
at issue are the removable bullet - proof ceramic plates that are part of a soldier 's body armor			0
the report by the @entity7 inspector general 's office , expected to be released officially on friday , says the @entity2 had flawed testing procedures before awarding contracts to make the armor plates			1
" @entity7 does not have assurance that its body armor provides a standard level of protection , " according to the report			0
army secretary @entity29 denied any problems with testing but said the armor is being recalled as a precaution and will be replaced with other plates that are not part of the recall , according to @entity2 officials			1
the recall represents only about 1.6 percent of the 1.9 million sets of body armor that have been put in the field since 2001 , @entity2 officials said			1
ceramic plates are the bullet - proof part of a soldier 's body armor that slide into the front and back of the vest			0
in a letter of response to the report from inspector general @entity50 , @entity29 said he did not agree with the findings and was supported by the military 's preeminent testing expert			1
" according to the @entity56 ( director of operational test and evaluation ) , the plates at issue passed the tests			0
again , that is not only the conclusion of the @entity2 , but of the @entity7 experts in the highly specialized field of ballistic testing , " @entity29 wrote			2
because there is a disagreement between two @entity7 entities , @entity29 is forwarding the matter to the deputy secretary of defense to make a final ruling on whether the questioned armor should be discarded or returned to the inventory for possible use , according to @entity2 officials			1
the report focused on a number of issues , many of which the @entity2 agreed with			2
however , the @entity2 and the inspector general are at odds over a testing step called " first article testing , " initial testing of a product to meet @entity2 standards			1
the inspector general says the @entity2 did not perform the tests correctly on some of the plates			1
@entity2 officials said there is no evidence of any imperfections in the plates			2
the inspector general 's report also questioned why the @entity2 had different criteria than the @entity95 in its testing of the equipment			1
" the criteria differed significantly , even when testing against the same threats , " the report said			2
" differences included the number of plates tested ( sample size ) , the shot pattern , the environmental conditions , the type of tests , and the pass / fail guidelines			0
" @entity2 officials close to the issue said not one soldier had been killed because of an armor defect			2
officials said the @entity2 has x-ray machines in the field to examine damaged plates to look for problems and build an information database to improve on the armor technology			0
rep. @entity121 , @entity123 - @entity122 , who requested the audit and has been pressing the issue of looking into body armor since 2006 , said that while the recall represents a relatively low percentage of plates , there is still a potential danger			2
" it is way too high for me			0
we do n't know how many soldiers could not live or escape being egregiously wounded because their body armor did not work , " she said			0
the inspector general audit is the second requested by @entity121 , who did not like the initial findings and thinks the @entity2 is wrong in its thinking about the current findings			1
she called the report " devastating			0
" " it was their responsibility to make sure that [ the body armor ] is state of the art and it will do everything it can to protect that soldier , " she said			0
" i am anxiously awaiting the results of this dispute			0

secretary of the army disagrees with defense report *citing* flawed test procedures
