-- how much would it take for you to consider selling your bone marrow ? a @entity5 appeals court puts the price at about $ 3,000 in a ruling that now makes it legal to pay donors for their bone - marrow tissue			1
the court 's decision may well help thousands of sick patients who need bone - marrow transplants to survive , but it also begs the question , what other body parts might next be up for sale ? the ruling came about at the end of 2011 , in a decision to an october 2009 lawsuit brought by a group of cancer patients , parents and bone - marrow - donation advocates against the government over the federal law banning the buying and selling of bodily organs			1
the plaintiffs were led by @entity31 , who has three daughters who suffer from @entity33 , a blood disorder that requires bone - marrow transplants to treat			1
@entity31 and the other plaintiffs said that too many such patients die waiting for transplants and argued that we should be allowed to pay people to donate their marrow as a way of ensuring a more reliable supply			1
time.com : @entity46 now lets organ donors tell their friends at the core of the plaintiffs ' argument was the @entity52 ( @entity53 ) , which since 1984 has forbid the buying and selling of human organs , including bone marrow			1
but new developments in bone - marrow extraction have made marrow donation not much different from donating blood			1
traditionally , bone - marrow donation required anesthesia and long needles to extract the marrow from the hip bones of donors			1
now , a technique called peripheral apheresis allows doctors to extract blood stem cells directly from the blood , instead of the bone -- patients first take a drug that pulls stem cells from the bone and into the blood -- meaning that the marrow cells should be considered a fluid like blood , rather than an organ , the plaintiffs argued			1
@entity53 does n't prohibit payments for blood or other fluids , such as plasma or semen			0
@entity5 attorney general @entity85 decided not to ask the @entity86 to review the appellate court 's decision , which would have been the next step in overturning it			2
that means the ruling stands -- and that people can now be paid up to $ 3,000 for their marrow , as long as it is collected by apheresis			1
in a concession to the spirit of @entity53 , however , the compensation ca n't be in cash ; it needs to be in the form of a voucher that can be applied to things such as scholarships , education , housing or a donation to a charity			0
while the decision applies only to the nine states covered by the @entity44 , and only to bone marrow obtained through apheresis , it does raise bigger questions about how we will look at organ donation in the future			2
with about 114,000 people waiting for organs in the @entity5 alone on any given day , and only 3,300 donors , the urgent medical need runs up against moral standards of the value of human life			1
once we start paying for the parts we need , though , how far do we go ? " we do n't allow people to buy and sell human beings , that 's slavery , " says dr. @entity125 , director of the bioethics program at @entity127			1
" should we allow people to buy and sell human body parts ? " time.com : where do ( some ) babies come from ? in @entity137 , a new law bans anonymous sperm and egg donors of course , certain body parts are already up for sale			1
aside from sperm and plasma , donors can also be paid for their eggs and hair			0
but by expanding that list , the court 's ruling reopens the long - standing ethical debate over the commercialization of human tissues			2
for now , legally " sellable " human body parts are n't ones that could be used to cure fatal diseases , which prevents a market frenzy			1
but if the bone - marrow case starts changing that -- and experts say it could -- it might jump - start a dangerous trend in which lower - income groups were disproportionately targeted or incentivized to give up their marrow and people with rarer blood types demanded more money for their valuable cells			1
still , the benefits of compensating people for providing cells like bone marrow -- which the body replaces and which involves a relatively safe extraction -- may be wide - reaching , as @entity31 and the plaintiffs argue			1
" in some sense , this is a policy experiment , and it could potentially be groundbreaking , " says @entity175 , professor of bioethics and public policy at the @entity178			0
" if we compensate donors who give by apheresis and more people end up receiving [ blood - ] stem - cell transplants , maybe we should think about this for other kinds of donations			1
" already , he points out , there is international trade for other organs			0
websites allow people to find matching donors for kidneys , for example ( people are born with two kidneys , but can live with one ) , and @entity5 patients travel to developing nations to obtain transplants			2
there is n't supposed to be compensation , but it 's hard to regulate such exchanges			0
time.com : @entity209 lifts ban on gay men donating blood			0
could the @entity5 be far behind ? nevertheless , selling tissues or organs may not be the logical first step in addressing the disconnect between supply and demand			2
@entity125 notes that there are other changes we can make to @entity5 organ - donation policy that might improve giving rates			2
in @entity226 , for example , all citizens are organ donors by default ; those who do n't wish to participate must opt out			0
in the @entity5 , in contrast , people must voluntarily opt in to give , which could be a deterrent			2
even within such systems , there are incentives that can entice donors			0
in @entity239 , for example , family members of donors are given priority on the waiting list of organs should they need one			0
" to me , it 's not clear that the current decision means we should overturn @entity53 , " says @entity125			0
" i personally think we should have the debate about whether there are creative ways of enhancing donation of organs			0
" certainly , if the goal is to improve the supply of much needed tissues without toeing an ethically troublesome line , those options are probably worth pursuing			0

@entity5 appeals court rules that donors may sell their bone - marrow tissue
plaintiffs argue that paying people for their tissue may *encourage* a greater supply of it
ruling only applies to marrow collected through the blood stream
experts worry those in low - income *brackets* might try to sell other body parts
