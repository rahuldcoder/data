lt. col. @entity16 went before a military judge -- and a standing - room - only courtroom -- in @entity1 on friday to face three charges of disobeying a lawful order , one count of missing movement ( not deploying with his unit ) and one count of dereliction of duty			1
he did not enter a plea at the arraignment hearing , and @entity9 asked to defer any plea until after the court could consider a motion to dismiss the case			2
judge @entity27 , an @entity4 colonel who was wearing basic camouflage fatigues under her black robes , agreed to the request and gave @entity16 's attorneys until august 20 to file a motion to dismiss			1

@entity16 and his legal team -- @entity9 , @entity46 's assistant and @entity16 's free - of - cost military attorney -- arrived 15 minutes late , then the lawyers went into a meeting with @entity27			1
the colonel remained in the 34 - seat courtroom , which was full of soldiers , primarily officers , all wearing basic camouflage fatigues			0
@entity16 smiled once while talking with @entity9 's assistant but otherwise did n't convey much emotion or say much except " yes , ma'am , " and " no , ma'am " to the judge			2
in addition to pushing back his plea , @entity16 waived the opportunity to choose whether a judge or jury would decide his fate			2
@entity16 is a decorated @entity4 doctor and an 18 - year veteran who is now facing court martial for disobeying orders to ship out for another tour of duty in @entity6			2
he specializes as a primary care physician and flight surgeon			0
doctors in those positions often fly in medevac helicopters in the war zone			0
@entity16 says the orders are illegal because , he claims , @entity7 -- the commander in chief -- has not proven he was born in this country and is therefore ineligible to be president			1
@entity16 wants @entity7 to produce his birth certificate			1
" it 's a fundamental of the @entity79 , and my oath of office is to the @entity79			0
and i believe we need truth on this matter , " @entity16 told @entity2 's " @entity85 " in may			2
two newspapers in @entity87 , @entity88 , published announcements of @entity7 's birth there in august , 1961			1
the @entity93 governor of @entity88 , @entity94 , has recently certified @entity7 's birth certificate as legitimate			1
" i had my health director , who is a physician by background , go personally view the birth certificate in the birth records of the @entity102 , " @entity94 recently told @entity96			0
" the president was in fact born at @entity105 in @entity87 , @entity88			1
and that 's just a fact			0
" " it 's been established he was born here , " the governor continued			2
" i can understand why people want to make certain that the constitutional requirement of being a natural - born @entity115 citizen ... but the question has been asked and answered			1
and i think just we should all move on now			0
" despite the evidence , roughly a quarter of @entity115 remains skeptical , including @entity16 and other so - called " birthers			1
" birthers have argued that @entity7 was not born in @entity88 , or that if he was , his citizenship was invalidated by living overseas as a child			1
@entity16 has been steadfast in his own defense			0
" i am not guilty of these charges , and will plead ' not guilty ' to them because of my conviction that our commander in chief may be ineligible under the @entity79 to serve in that highest of all offices , " @entity16 said in a news release issued this week by the @entity126 -- a group that has established a fund for his legal defense			2
the @entity79 matters , " he said			0
" if president @entity7 is a natural - born citizen , then the @entity115 people deserve to see proof , and if he is not , then i believe the orders in this case were illegal			1
