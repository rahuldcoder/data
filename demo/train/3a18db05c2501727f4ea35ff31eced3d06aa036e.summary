@entity0 -- the woman accusing former @entity4 chief @entity3 of sexually assaulting her insisted she was " telling the truth from my heart , " in an interview broadcast monday			1
i want him to go to jail , " @entity10 told @entity11			1
" i want him to know you can not use your power when you do something like this			0
" the 32 - year - old hotel maid , whose credibility has been called into question by prosecutors and @entity3 's lawyers , said she was terrified when she found out how powerful @entity3 was			1
when she saw news reports explaining that the man she was accusing was a leading candidate for the @entity28 presidency , " i said , ' oh , my @entity29			2
i said , ' they 're going to kill me , i 'm going to die			0
' " that 's because in her native guinea , @entity33 , accusing " a powerful man like that " would put her life in danger , she said			2
@entity10 's choice to go public with her accusations in the middle of a pending criminal investigation is extremely unusual			1
she spoke with both @entity11 and @entity42			2
@entity1 previously has not identified @entity10 , given the network 's policy against naming alleged sexual assault victims			1
but it is now naming her , in light of her decision to make her case to the media			0
on may 14 , @entity10 accused @entity3 , 62 , of assaulting and trying to rape her at @entity52 's @entity51 , where she was an employee			1
he was charged in @entity0 with sexual abuse and attempted rape , pleading not guilty on all counts			0
he insists the encounter with @entity10 was consensual			2
@entity3 's attorneys @entity57 and @entity59 issued a revised statement monday standing by their earlier claim that @entity10 is " the first accuser in history to conduct a media campaign to persuade a prosecutor to pursue charges against an innocent person from whom she wants money			1
" " these efforts are a desperate distraction from the key fact that ms. @entity10 has had to admit to misleading these very same prosecutors from the beginning			2
and , her lawyers know that her claim for money suffers a fatal blow when the criminal charges are dismissed as they must be , " the statement said			0
accompanied by her lawyers , @entity10 plans to meet on wednesday with prosecutors in @entity52 , a source close to the investigation tells @entity1			1
this would be the first such meeting in nearly a month			0
relations between the two parties have been strained since @entity10 's attorney @entity86 held a news conference in which he graphically detailed the alleged attack and then accused prosecutors of abandoning his client			1
in addition to the state case , @entity86 said monday that he plans to file a lawsuit this week against @entity3 on behalf of @entity10			1
@entity3 's lawyers said , referring to @entity10 and her attorney 's actions , said , " the number of rallies , press conferences and media events they have orchestrated is exceeded only by the number of lies and misstatements she has made to law enforcement , friends , medical professionals and reporters ... it is time for this unseemly circus to stop			1
" @entity86 shot back , accusing @entity3 's attorneys of conducting " an unprecedented smear campaign against the victim of a violent sexual attack			1
" " because of those contemptible , baseless and anonymous attacks , ms. @entity10 was forced to come forward in order to put a face to the brutal crime , " @entity86 said in a statement			2
on july 1 , a judge freed @entity3 from house arrest after prosecutors presented evidence showing that @entity10 admitted she had lied about the specifics of her whereabouts after the incident and , from her past , the details of an asylum application and information she put on tax forms			1
prosecutors said she admitted lying on the asylum application about having been a victim of a gang rape , even providing details of that attack			0
she cried when she first told prosecutors about the alleged gang rape , but in a subsequent interview , she admitted it never occurred			0
she said the fabricated account on the asylum application was made with the assistance of a man who " provided her with a cassette recording of the facts " so that she could memorize them			0
@entity11 reported that in the interview , @entity10 acknowledged " mistakes			1
" but she insisted that her story of what happened in the hotel is the unvarnished truth			0
" he came to me and grabbed my breasts , " she told @entity11 , adding that she asked him to stop and said " i do n't want to lose my job			2
" " i was like , ' stop this , stop this , ' " she said in the interview			0
but , she insisted , @entity3 " kept pushing me back to the hallway			0
... i was so afraid			0
" in the interview with @entity42 , conducted at her lawyer 's office in @entity0 , @entity10 said @entity3 was naked when he slammed the door shut to his luxury hotel room , forced himself upon her and tried to make her perform oral sex on him			1
she said she was " nervous " and " scared " when she eventually ran from @entity3 's hotel room , ending an incident that took about 15 minutes			2
@entity3 was initially arrested at @entity0 's @entity172 while on board a @entity174 - bound plane			2
his arrest created an international furor , prompting his resignation as @entity4 chief as @entity0 judge @entity180 ordered him held under a $ 6 million bail			0
political watchers in @entity28 said he would no longer be a likely candidate for the upcoming presidential election			0
while prosecutors have questioned @entity10 's credibility , the charges against @entity3 have not been dismissed			1
there have been further twists in recent weeks , including writer @entity190 's filing of a complaint accusing @entity3 of attempted rape in @entity28 , stemming from an alleged 2003 incident in @entity174			1
a lawyer for @entity3 in @entity28 said he subsequently filed a counterclaim against @entity196 for false declarations			0
@entity10 filed a libel lawsuit against the @entity199 and five of its reporters after the newspaper reported that the woman accusing @entity3 was a prostitute			1
the paper cited anonymous sources and said it stands by its reporting			0
" because of him , they call me a prostitute , " @entity10 said in the @entity42 interview , blaming @entity3 for the accusations			1
@entity3 's next court date for the @entity0 incident is scheduled for august 1			2
the hearing had been pushed back from @entity215 as prosecutors tried to determine whether to drop the charges or move forward in the case , said @entity219 , communications director for manhattan district attorney @entity220			0
on sunday , amid the fresh attention related to @entity10 's interviews , @entity219 declined to comment on what she called the " pending criminal case			1
" " to protect the integrity of the criminal justice system , the rights of the victim and the rights of the accused , we will not discuss the facts or evidence in what remains an ongoing investigation , " she said in a statement			0
@entity1 's @entity236 and @entity237 contributed to this report .			0
