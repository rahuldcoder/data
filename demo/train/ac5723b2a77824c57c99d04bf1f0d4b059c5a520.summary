@entity0 -- @entity1 's @entity2 and other top political reporters empty out their notebooks each sunday on " @entity5 " to reveal five things that will be in the headlines in the days , weeks and months ahead			0
fallout from attorney general @entity10 's resignation , an intriguing new @entity12 2016 trial balloon and two key 2014 crunch - time calculations made for a lively trip around the " @entity5 " table sunday			1
election day is 37 days away , unless it was yesterday if you live in a 2014 battleground state and are getting inundated with campaign calls and door knocks , there may be a solution : vote early			1
early balloting began this past week in @entity24 and @entity25 , two states with @entity28 races being closely watched this year , and it 's coming soon in other states with key contests			1
when it is all said and done , some strategists keeping track of things this year suggest as much as 30 % of the vote could come from early and absentee balloting			1
democrats in recent cycles have bragged they have a more sophisticated -- and successful -- system to identify voters who might not show up on @entity41 and to push them to vote early			1
and some @entity37 have suggested their technological and organizational prowess will again prove decisive in some key places this year			0
but @entity12 insist 2014 will be different , and with so many key @entity28 races so close , the performance in the early voting arena could be a big battleground within the battlegrounds			1
and remember -- campaigns see the lists of those who vote early , and in most cases you will be crossed off the phone bank list ! 2			1
crunch time means tough $ $ decisions some candidates and campaigns are about to realize they have fewer friends than they thought			0
with so many close races , and the battle for control of the @entity28 so tight , the political parties and their super pac supporters are beginning to make some tough calls on spending priorities			0
@entity70 's @entity69 , for example , reports republicans are starting to hold back spending in @entity74 's @entity28 race because the @entity75 is leading and the @entity12 has urgent needs elsewhere			2
( @entity77 , for example			0
) and as @entity37 look to hone their final - weeks spending , @entity69 reports that @entity80 is getting a skeptical look -- even though @entity37 would love to knock off the @entity12 incumbent , sen. @entity82			2
" these are key decisions that are being made , not just for the race for the @entity28 , but also as we mentioned before , the runoffs in @entity87 and @entity88 , " said @entity69			0
" republicans are already setting aside millions of dollars to spend in @entity88 and @entity37 are going to have to make that decision too , soon			0
the next attorney general -- an @entity93 trailblazer ? as president @entity95 searches for a new attorney general , gay rights organizations are suggesting it is time for a bold , historic stroke			1
@entity99 of @entity100 says a former @entity102 attorney , @entity101 , is being pushed by some liberals			0
she is a lesbian , and if nominated and confirmed would be the first openly gay @entity105 member			0
" the president 's @entity93 supporters feel like nominating an openly gay cabinet secretary would really round out his record on gay rights , " said @entity99			2
" there 's also politics involved , if you have @entity12 in a position where they may have to weigh how tough they go after a gay woman in the lead - up to a presidential year where they 're trying to look more inclusive -- that could be all kinds of headaches for the @entity12			1
@entity10 's post-administration plans the @entity125 's @entity124 told us back in august that @entity10 was plotting his exit strategy and had shared his early thinking with @entity95			1
now , @entity129 has some insights into @entity10 's next chapter			0
" once he 's gone , i hear he 's interested in writing a book , perhaps teaching , but also maybe some sort of foundation work to really give back to his roots and his legacy , which is around civil rights , " said @entity129			0
is @entity139 the @entity12 's answer to @entity141 ? @entity139 's 2010 @entity28 campaign did n't turn out so well			1
but the former @entity144 ceo is apparently dipping her toes into the 2016 presidential waters anyway			0
@entity147 of the @entity148 tells us there is plenty of skepticism , but also notes that @entity139 recently made some political rounds in @entity154 and made it clear she was thinking about it			2
" it 's just going to be really fascinating to watch just how much the @entity12 want a strong female face in that mix , " said @entity147 .			2

as much as 30 % of the vote could come from early balloting
@entity95 's next attorney general could be an @entity93 trailblazer
