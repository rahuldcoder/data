@entity0 , @entity1 , perhaps there is no more appropriate title than simply " @entity14			1
" @entity5 , @entity6 and @entity10 get together at the " @entity14 " premiere in @entity16			1
which is saying something , since " @entity14 " frequently treads into the darker realms of comedy			1
@entity5 leads the cast as @entity22 , an a-list @entity16 comedian whose fame and fortune has brought him a beautiful mansion on the beach , lots of luck with the ladies and , as the audience soon discovers , a life of loneliness			1
@entity5 is quick to point out that he and his character have little in common			1
" i ca n't really say this guy is me ; he 's not living my life , " says @entity5 , who is married with two children			1
" the movie star thing we have in common ; we have a few mood swings in common			1
... but the lifestyle and the attitude is not really me			0
" @entity22 's biggest problem is n't his desolation , however			2
he 's been diagnosed with a leukemia - like terminal disease , prompting him to get back to his roots and do more stand - up comedy			2
along the way , he hires struggling comedian @entity51 , played by @entity6 , to pen jokes for him and act as his personal assistant			1
despite hurling an occasional insult at @entity55 , @entity22 learns to trust his new , eager - to - please sidekick			0
the feeling is n't always mutual			0
@entity58 is forced to adapt to his boss ' constant mood swings , erratic behavior as he deals with the fear of dying and deep regret at losing @entity64 ( @entity65 ) , the only woman he ever loved			0
however , @entity58 does earn a steady paycheck -- and gets a taste of show business			0
@entity6 , who says he would n't be in comedy if he never saw @entity5 's movies while he was growing up , says " @entity14 " paints an accurate picture of the ups and downs of comedians who are just starting out			1
" it 's an incredibly realistic representation , " @entity6 says			1
" those scenes where you 're backstage at the comedy club and you 're all sitting around pitching jokes to each other			0
it 's exactly like that			2
" @entity10 , who performed stand - up comedy earlier in his career , says , " it is an ode to stand - up			1
i 've always been a crazy fan of stand - up comedians			2
@entity90 ... @entity91 , things like that			0
" @entity10 , who knows he 's taking a risk with " @entity14 's " mix of light and darkness , made a wisecrack about his hopes for the film at the @entity0 premiere			1
" well , i think there 's 10 movies that are going to be up for best picture this year , and we definitely are shooting for no. 16 , " he says			0
the cast also took some risks , performing stand - up in front of live audiences for the film -- and , occasionally , watching their jokes fall flat			0
@entity7 says he had never done stand - up before and calls the experience " terrifying			0
" " it can be brutal out there , " @entity6 adds			2
@entity5 , the most seasoned comedian by far , remembers his first days onstage and can relate			2
" it 's all about your last set , " he recalls			0
" if i did good wednesday ... all day thursday , i was in a good mood			0
" then thursday night comes around and i go onstage and if i did bad , friday was a miserable time for everyone			0

@entity5 and @entity6 star in @entity10 's " @entity14 "
film presents " realistic representation " of comedians ' lives , @entity6 says
@entity5 plays lonely movie star ; he says he 's not much like character in real life
